This Shared Collection page will showcase all of the blogs, publications, YouTube feeds, and Google News Alerts you want to showcase and make it easy for other people to follow the same sources with just a click. It&#8217;ll also allow you to create a personalized URL for your Shared Collections (nab the one you want today!).</p>\n<p>Take that Shared Collections page and use it to collaborate with others or to show the world what feeds your mind. You can even customize it to fit your company’s identity or your personal brand.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://blog1.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/screenshot-2015-09-01-08-15-18.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"visual alignnone wp-image-6880 aligncenter\" src=\"https://blog1.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/screenshot-2015-09-01-08-15-18.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2015-09-01 08.15.18\" width=\"414\" height=\"395\" srcset=\"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/screenshot-2015-09-01-08-15-18.png 620w, https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/screenshot-2015-09-01-08-15-18-300x286.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 414px) 100vw, 414px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Shared Collections is completely opt-in.

What can I follow?</h4>\n <div class=\"webfeeds-accordion__content\">\n  <p>Anyone on a Pro+, Business, or Enterprise plan has access to the Twitter integration. Once you’ve connected your account to Twitter (go to the ‘Twitter feeds’ tab in Feedly to set it up) you can follow accounts, hashtags, searches, or Lists. </p>\n </div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"webfeeds-accordion\">\n <h4 class=\"webfeeds-accordion__title\">Can I follow protected Twitter accounts? </h4>\n<div class=\"webfeeds-accordion__content\">\n  <p>Yes. If the Twitter account you want to follow is protected, just make sure the Twitter account you&#8217;re using to connect to Feedly follows the protected account.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"webfeeds-accordion\">\n <h4 class=\"webfeeds-accordion__title\">How do I remove retweets?</h4>\n<div class=\"webfeeds-accordion__content\">\n<p><p>\nRight now, it’s not possible to explicitly remove retweets. If you want to remove retweets from your feeds, our recommendation is to hide retweets from inside your Twitter account. <a href=\"https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/retweet-faqs#:~:text=Select%20Turn%20off%20Retweets%20from,are%20already%20in%20your%20timeline.\">Here’s how</a></p> \n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"webfeeds-accordion\">\n <h4 class=\"webfeeds-accordion__title\">Do I need to follow both “Tweets” and “Tweets with links” for an account or hashtag? </h4>\n<div class=\"webfeeds-accordion__content\">\n<p>Nope. Choose “Tweets” and you’ll get all tweets, with and without links. If you follow “Tweets with Links,” you’ll only get tweets that link out to articles, videos, pictures, or any other type of external content.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"webfeeds-accordion\">\n <h4 class=\"webfeeds-accordion__title\">Is it possible to filter a search further once I follow a hashtag?</h4>\n<div class=\"webfeeds-accordion__content\">\n  <p>Yes. Our advice is to first use <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search-advanced?lang=en\">Twitter’s advanced search</a> to refine your search. Then, once you&#8217;re satisfied with the results, copy and paste the URL of the search in Feedly to create a new source.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"webfeeds-accordion\">\n <h4 class=\"webfeeds-accordion__title\">Can I publish to Twitter from Feedly? </h4>\n<div class=\"webfeeds-accordion__content\">\n<p>When you connect your Feedly to your Twitter account, this is a read-only connection allowing your Feedly to read tweets. Feedly will not write any tweets. To share insights from Feedly to Twitter, click the Twitter icon at the top of any article to generate a tweet and share your insights.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"webfeeds-accordion\">\n <h4 class=\"webfeeds-accordion__title\">Can I follow my own Twitter account? </h4>\n<div class=\"webfeeds-accordion__content\">\n<p>Of course! Follow the steps to follow a Twitter account. In the “Twitter Feeds” tab, search for your Twitter handle.</p>\n<p>You can choose to follow all tweets, or only tweets that link out to articles, so you’ll get the articles you share on Twitter right inside your Feedly.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"webfeeds-accordion\">\n <h4 class=\"webfeeds-accordion__title\">Will every single tweet from that hashtag get pulled into my feeds? </h4>\n<div class=\"webfeeds-accordion__content\">\n<p>Yes. If you add a hashtag as a source, all the tweets generated for that hashtag will get pulled into your feed. If you’re getting too much noise from a hashtag, we recommend training Leo to prioritize or mute certain keywords or topics so that you only see what&#8217;s most important to you.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"webfeeds-accordion\">\n <h4 class=\"webfeeds-accordion__title\">What’s the limit for articles from Twitter per day?</h4>\n<div class=\"webfeeds-accordion__content\">\n<p>Feedly has a limit of 5,000 articles per day from each Twitter source.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-gts-feedly-related-post webfeeds-related-posts\"><h3>You might also be interested in</h3><div class=\"webfeeds-related-posts__container\"><div class=\"webfeeds-related-post magazine\"><a href=\"https://blog.feedly.com/feedly-for-cybersecurity/\" class=\"webfeeds-related-post__content\"><header class=\"visual\" style=\"background-image: url(https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/leo-cyber-security@3x.png)\"></header><h4 class=\"webfeeds-related-post__title\">Introducing Feedly for Cybersecurity</h4><p class=\"webfeeds-related-post__excerpt\">Streamline your open-source intelligence.</p></a></div><div class=\"webfeeds-related-post magazine\"><a href=\"https://blog.feedly.com/leo/\" class=\"webfeeds-related-post__content\"><header class=\"visual\" style=\"background-image: url(https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Leo-Waving.gif)\"></header><h4 class=\"webfeeds-related-post__title\">Meet Leo, Your AI Research Assistant</h4><p class=\"webfeeds-related-post__excerpt\">Keeping up with topics and trends you care about within a sea of articles can be overwhelming and time-consuming.</p></a></div></div></div>\n                </div>\n            \n\n           ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 06 Aug 2020 03:54:05 +0000","feedId":887,"bgimg":"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Leo-Twitter.gif","linkMd5":"0823ae4b945e58f9ea72d4148b5fda51","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn2@2020_1/2020/08/16/13-38-39-676_c7db9e8be4c22d7b.webp","destWidth":640,"destHeight":477,"author":"Edwin K","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Leo-Twitter.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx20/cdn13@2020_6/2020/08/16/13-38-59-072_c7db9e8be4c22d7b.webp","https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Jon-Henshaw@3x.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn31@2020_1/2020/08/16/13-38-40-024_c20538361c4bfb36.webp","https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Follow-Twitter-Accounts@3x.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn84@2020_4/2020/08/16/13-38-54-972_cc6855a8a82f09b7.webp","https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Gif_1_with_background.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn4@2020_2/2020/08/16/13-38-56-435_86657f088fc66d0f.webp","https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Gif_2_with_background.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx17/cdn80@2020_5/2020/08/16/13-38-44-158_d49e615d2fbe1cc7.webp","https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Train-Leo@3x-1024x694.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn61@2020_2/2020/08/16/13-38-51-504_e4566a2f2cbfa494.webp","https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Mute-Tweets@3x-1024x694.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn29@2020_3/2020/08/16/13-38-52-480_d5b119f6d9484b61.webp","https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Group-11.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn78@2020_5/2020/08/16/13-38-52-881_48ed813c8415c042.webp","https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Twitter-lists@3x-1024x666.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn44@2020_6/2020/08/16/13-38-46-298_fde30eb8af582b87.webp","https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Twitter-Searches@3x-1024x667.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn71@2020_3/2020/08/16/13-38-40-561_78417257d722ba8c.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 21:38:35","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 21:38:35","title":"What Goes Down Better Come Up a.k.a.

For a cloud based company, being down for any period of time is soul-crushing never mind for a few mornings in a row. This led to a lot of frustration, late nights, and general questioning of the order of the universe. But with some persistence we managed to get through it and figure out the problem. We thought it may be some combination of instructive and interesting for others to hear, so we&#8217;re sharing the story. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But first we&#8217;d especially like to thank <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/larsgeorge\">Lars George</a>. Lars is a central figure in the <a href=\"http://hbase.apache.org\">HBase</a> community who has now founded a consulting company, <a href=\"http://www.opencore.com\">OpenCore</a>. It&#8217;s essentially impossible to find a great consultant in these situations, but through a bit of luck Lars happened to be in the Bay Area during this period and stopped by our offices for a few days to help out. His deep understanding of the HBase source code as well as past experiences was pivotal in diagnosing the problem.</span></p>\n<h2>The Cloud Distilled</h2>\n<p>Boiled down to basics, the feedly cloud does 2 things, downloads new articles from websites (which we call &#8220;polling&#8221;) and serve API requests so users can read articles via our website, mobile apps, and even third party applications like reeder. This sounds simple, and in some sense it is. Where it gets complex is the scale at which our system operates. On the polling side, there are about 40 million sources producing over 1000 articles every second. On the API side, we have about 10 million users generating over 200 million API requests per day. That&#8217;s a whole lotta bytes flowing through the system.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_8330\" style=\"width: 867px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-8330\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-8330 size-full\" src=\"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Screenshot-2016-07-11-16.22.05.png\" alt=\"feedly Cloud diagram\" width=\"857\" height=\"710\" data-wp-pid=\"8330\" srcset=\"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Screenshot-2016-07-11-16.22.05.png 857w, https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Screenshot-2016-07-11-16.22.05-300x249.png 300w, https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Screenshot-2016-07-11-16.22.05-768x636.png 768w, https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Screenshot-2016-07-11-16.22.05-800x663.png 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 857px) 100vw, 857px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-8330\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">the main components of the cloud</p></div></p>\n<p>Due to this amount of data, the feedly cloud has grown significantly over the last 3 years: crawling more feeds, serving more users, and archiving more historical content – to allow users to search, go back in time, and dig deeper into topics.</p>\n<p>Another source of complexity is openness. As a co-founder, this is one aspect of feedly that I really love. We allow essentially any website to be able to connect with any user. We also allow 3rd party apps to use our API in their application. As an engineer, this can cause lots of headaches. Sourcing article data from other websites leads to all kinds of strange edge cases &#8212; 50MB articles, weird/incorrect character encodings, etc. And 3rd party apps can generate strange/inefficient access patterns.</p>\n<p>Both of these factors combine to make performance problems particularly hard to diagnose.</p>\n<h2>What Happened</h2>\n<p>We experienced degraded performance during the week of April 10th and more severe outages the following week. It was fairly easy to narrow the problem down to our database (HBase). In fact, In the weeks prior, we noticed occasional &#8216;blips&#8217; in performance and during those blips a slowdown in database operations, albeit on a much smaller scale.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_8336\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-8336\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-8336 size-medium\" src=\"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/lightning-300x188.jpg\" alt=\"Artist depiction of the feedly cloud raining down destruction\" width=\"300\" height=\"188\" data-wp-pid=\"8336\" srcset=\"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/lightning-300x188.jpg 300w, https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/lightning-768x480.jpg 768w, https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/lightning-1024x640.jpg 1024w, https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/lightning-800x500.jpg 800w, https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/lightning.jpg 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-8336\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The feedly cloud was not so happy that week, my friends.</p></div></p>\n<p>Fortunately our ops team had already been collecting hbase metrics into a graphing system. I can&#8217;t emphasize how important this was. Without any historical information, we&#8217;d be at a total loss as to what had changed in the system. After poking around the many, many, many HBase metrics we found something that looked off (the &#8220;fsSyncLatencyAvgTime&#8221; metric). Better still, these anomalies roughly lined up with our down times. This led us to come up with a few theories:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We were writing larger values. This could occur if user or article data changed somehow or due to a buggy code change.</li>\n<li>We were writing more data overall. Perhaps some new features we built were overwhelming HBase.</li>\n<li>Some hardware problem.</li>\n<li>We hit some kind of system limit in HBase and things were slowing down due to the amount or structure of our data.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Unfortunately all these theories are extremely hard to prove or disprove, and each team member has his own personal favorite. This is where Lars&#8217;s experience really helped. After reviewing the graphs, he dismissed the &#8220;system limit&#8221; theory. Our cluster is much smaller than some other companies out there and the configuration seemed sane. His feeling was it was a hardware/networking issue, but there was no clear indicator.</p>\n<h3>Theory 1: Writing Larger Values</h3>\n<p>This theory was kind of a long shot. The idea is that perhaps every so often we were writing really big values and that caused hbase to have issues. We added more metrics (this is a common theme when performance problems hit) to track when outlier read/write sizes occur, e.g. if we read or wrote a value larger than 5MB. After examining the charts, large read/writes kind of lined up with slowdowns but not really. To eliminate this as a possibility, we added an option to reject any large read/writes in our code. This wouldn&#8217;t be a final solution &#8212; all you oddballs that subscribe to 20,000 sources wouldn&#8217;t be able to access your feedly &#8212; but it let us confirm that this was not the root cause as we continued to have problems.</p>\n<h3>Theory 2: Writing More Data</h3>\n<p>This theory was perhaps more plausible than theory 1. The idea was that as feedly is growing, we eventually just reached a point where our request volume was too much for our database cluster to handle. We again added some metrics to track overall data read and write rates to hbase. Here again, things kind of lined up but not really. But we noticed we had high write volume on our analytics data table. This table contains a lot of valuable information for us, but we decided to disable all read/write activity to it as it&#8217;s not system critical.</p>\n<p>After deploying the change, things got much better! Hour long outages were reduced to a few small blips. But this didn&#8217;t sit well with us. Our cluster is pretty sizable, and should be able to handle our request load. Also, the rate of increase in downtime was way faster than our increase in storage used or request rate. So we left the analytics table disabled to keep performance manageable but continued the hunt.</p>\n<h3>Theory 3: Hardware Problem</h3>\n<p>As a software engineer this is always my favorite theory. It generally means I&#8217;ve done nothing wrong and don&#8217;t have to do anything to fix the problem. Unfortunately hardware fails in a myriad of oddball ways, so it can be very hard to convince everyone this is the cause and more importantly to identify the failing piece of equipment. This ended up being the root cause, but was particularly hard to pin down in this case.</p>\n<h2>How we Found the Problem and Fixed it</h2>\n<p>Here again, Lars&#8217;s experience helped us out. He recommended isolating the HBase code where the problem surfaced and then creating a reproducible test by running it in a standalone manner. So after about a day of work I was able to build a test we could run on our database machines, but independent of our production data. And it reproduced the problem! When debugging intermittent issues, having a reproducible test case is 90% of the battle. I was able to enable all the database log messages during the test and I noticed 2 machines were always involved in operations when slowdowns occurred, dn1 and dn3.</p>\n<p>I then extended the test to separately simulate the networking and disk write behavior the HBase code performed. This let us narrow down the problem down to a network issue. We removed the 2 nodes from our production cluster and things immediately got better. Our ops team found out the problem was actually in a network cable or patch panel. This was an especially insidious failure as it didn&#8217;t manifest itself in any machine logs. Incidentally, network issues was actually Lars&#8217;s original guess as to the problem!</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_8341\" style=\"width: 957px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-8341\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-8341 size-full\" src=\"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/sync-latency.png\" alt=\"sync latency\" width=\"947\" height=\"222\" data-wp-pid=\"8341\" srcset=\"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/sync-latency.png 947w, https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/sync-latency-300x70.png 300w, https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/sync-latency-768x180.png 768w, https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/sync-latency-800x188.png 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 947px) 100vw, 947px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-8341\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The metric in question when we fixed the problem.

If you can&#8217;t find a great consultant, lots of people are generally willing to help on message boards or other places.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Stayed focused/methodical.</strong> It can get crazy when things are going wrong, but having a scientific process and logical way to attack the problem can make things manageable.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Dig into our tech stack.</strong> We rely almost exclusively on open source software. This enabled us to really understand and debug what was going on.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Things we could have done better:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Communicate.</strong> While Lars suggested networking, I initially discounted it since the problem manifested everywhere in our system, not just one machine. I would have learned there are some shared resources specific to data center build outs.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Gone more quickly to the hardware possibility.</strong> We did a lot of google searching for the symptoms we were seeing in our system, but there was not much out there. This is kind of an indicator something weird is probably happening in your environment. A hardware issue is pretty likely.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Attacked the problem earlier.</strong> As I mentioned, we had seen small blips prior to the outages and even done some (mostly unproductive) diagnostic work. Unfortunately not giving this top priority came back to bite us.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_8337\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-8337\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-8337 size-medium\" src=\"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/cloud-300x200.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" data-wp-pid=\"8337\" srcset=\"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/cloud-300x200.jpg 300w, https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/cloud.jpg 467w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-8337\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The feedly cloud today, hardy and hale.</p></div></p>\n<p>But there&#8217;s a happy ending to this story. As this post hopefully demonstrates, we&#8217;ve learned a lot and came out stronger: the feedly cloud is faster than ever and we have a much better understanding of the inner workings of HBase. We realize speed is very important to our users and will continue to invest in making the feedly Cloud faster and more resilient.

The actors waging these wars don’t just care about fraud either. They’re part of criminal organisations. Foreign governments stealing data for defense or national interests. Even terrorists or activists driven to disrupt and cause harm.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What’s more, they’re increasingly capable and sophisticated. It’s a growing threat that can strike anyone at any time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you learn about threat actors’ tactics and motivations, you can better prepare against them, saving you the costs and headaches that come with a breach or attack.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there’s so much content to wade through when investigating these threat actors. It’s like fishing blind in an ocean. You’ll never know what’s coming back on the hook. More time and stress is spent on finding information about the threat, rather than acting on it. You can be overwhelmed.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’re passionate about helping you refine and streamline your open-source intelligence. That’s why we’ve taught Leo, <a href=\"https://blog.feedly.com/leo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">your AI research assistant</a>, to recognize threat actor groups.

It’s a powerful and effective way to keep up with their latest techniques, tactics, and procedures.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>You’re in control</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Leo has been trained to recognize all the threat actor groups referenced by <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/groups/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">the MITRE ATT&#38;CK framework</a>. This is a list of common names for hacking groups, as recognized by the global security community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Asking Leo to prioritize MuddyWater in your security feed is as simple as creating a new Topic priority and selecting ‘MuddyWater’ as the topic.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gts-feedly-image wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"webfeeds-frame-simple\"><img src=\"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Threat-Actors-2.png\"/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><figcaption>Enter a threat actor alias in the topic field</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>When you prioritize MuddyWater, Leo will also look for other synonyms for that group like Seedworm and TEMP.Zagros.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can <a href=\"https://blog.feedly.com/leo-and-topics/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">combine topics with +AND and +OR</a> to create even more targeted priorities for Leo.

Everyone can create new Personal Boards. Feedly Teams users will see separate lists in the left navigation for Personal and Team Boards.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Feedly is turning its reader into a powerful knowledge board creation tool</p><cite>@sarahintampa / Techcrunch</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to Save an Article to a Board</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Boards are for saving and organizing articles. All Feedly plans (Basic, <a href=\"https://feedly.com/i/pro/launch-board?utm_source=feedly&#38;utm_medium=blog&#38;utm_campaign=2017-launch-boards\">Pro</a>, and <a href=\"https://feedly.com/i/landing/team?utm_source=feedly&#38;utm_medium=blog&#38;utm_campaign=2017-launch-boards\">Teams</a>) can&#160;save articles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Click on the star on any article to save it. If this is your first time using Boards, we will ask you to create one.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image webfeeds-frame-browser webfeeds-size-large\"><img src=\"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/socialmediaboard03-032717.png\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to naming your Boards, try to keep a singular&#160;focus. This will keep you organized by your&#160;specific projects, clients, brands you monitor, or other important tasks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"webfeeds-pro-tips\">Save a single article to multiple Boards. In the&#160;example above, a piece about marketing tactics is saved to both the “Marketing &#38; Growth” and&#160;&#8220;Social Media&#8221; Boards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to get started right now?

Feedly Pro and Teams users can enrich articles using notes and highlights.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are part of a&#160;Feedly Teams plan, your teammates will be able to read your notes and add their own.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s a <a href=\"https://blog.feedly.com/add-note/\">step-by-step guide to adding notes</a> without missing a beat.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image webfeeds-frame-browser webfeeds-size-large\"><img src=\"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/notes-032717.png\" alt=\"\"/><figcaption>Your note appears at the top of the article, where you can edit it or add another note right below it.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Highlight the most important passages to make it easy for your colleagues and other executives to scan.

By creating shared Team Boards, you have a central place to store those gems you find and see what your teammates have saved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Say goodbye to clunky email chains and spreadsheets. With Team Boards you have the additional option of sending email roundups to teammates as well as executives outside your team and even external clients.

Read Later is still&#160;there. You can save articles to Boards <em>and</em> Read Later for an even more customized Feedly.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Q: How are boards different from tags?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We heard&#160;from users that it would be useful to be able to privately share content with teammates. Boards felt more like a central hub with&#160;shared access to&#160;allow for team curation. Tags didn&#8217;t meet the needs communicated to us by the Feedly community. Given that this is an area where we are going to invest a lot, we decided to change the terminology to have the right foundation in place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you were using tags, all of your tags and the content associated with them are available as private personal Boards.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Q: How do I rename a board?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When you are looking at one of your Boards, click on the [&#8230;] button and go to Settings. There you can change the Board name.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Q: How many boards can I create?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Feedly Pro and Teams accounts have unlimited Boards. Basic accounts can create up to 3 Boards.

Shared tags </b><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">&#8211; When we released Shared Collections last month, some users asked us to go one step further and also allow them to share some of their tags.

Better Slack integration</b><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> &#8211; We think that we can reduce some of the friction that exists around manually sharing stories from your feedly into your Slack channels. Many users are  using feedly and Slack in tandem, so we are going to invest some time enhancing the integration.</span></p>\n<p><b>6.

They seem related to loading web pages, videos, and animated gifs within feedly. We hate crashes as much as anyone else, and we are fixing this. We are investing time into a new update of the feedly iOS application which changes how we load content and minimizes the risk of the application crashing. We are also investing time optimizing how we serve content to minimize battery usage. You should see the fruits of this work in the v30 update of the app which should be available within a few weeks.</span></p>\n<p><b>7.

Those independent thinkers continuously explore the edge of the known and share insightful and inspiring ideas with their communities.</p>\n<p>Connecting people to the best sources for the topics that matter to them has been core to our mission since the very start of Feedly.</p>\n<p>But discovery is a hard problem. The web is organic, a reflection of the global community&#8217;s changing needs and priorities. There are millions of sources across thousands of topics and we all have a different appetite when it comes to feeding our minds.\n</p>\n<figure class=\"webfeeds-frame-simple webfeeds-size-large\"><img src=\"http://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screenshot-2018-09-04-22.13.47.png\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<p>About twelve months ago, we created a machine learning team to see if the latest progress in deep learning and natural language processing could help us crack this nut.</p>\n<p>Today, we are excited to give you a preview of the result of that work with the release of the new discovery experience in the Feedly Lab app (Experience 06).</p>\n<h2>Two thousand topics</h2>\n<p>The first discovery challenge is to create a taxonomy of topics.</p>\n<p>You can think of Feedly as a rich graph of people, topics, and sources. To build the right taxonomy, we started with the raw data on all of Feedly’s sources. We had to create a model to clean, enrich, and organize that data into a hierarchy of topics. <a href=\"https://blog.feedly.com/data-science-behind-recommendations-in-feedly/\">Learn more about the data science behind this</a>.</p>\n<p>The result is a rich, interconnected network of two thousand English topics. And it’s mapped well with how people expect to explore and read on the Web.</p>\n<p>Some topics are broad: <a href=\"https://feedly.com/i/top/tech-blogs\">tech</a>, <a href=\"https://feedly.com/i/top/security-blogs\">security</a>, <a href=\"https://feedly.com/i/top/design-blogs\">design</a>, <a href=\"https://feedly.com/i/top/marketing-blogs\">marketing</a>. Some are very niche: <a href=\"https://feedly.com/i/top/ar-blogs\">augmented reality</a>, <a href=\"https://feedly.com/i/top/malware-blogs\">malware</a>, <a href=\"https://feedly.com/i/top/typography-blogs\">typography</a>, or <a href=\"https://feedly.com/i/top/seo-blogs\">SEO</a>.</p>\n<p>On the discovery homepage, we showcase thirty topics based on popular industries, trends, skills, or passions. You can access all of the topics in Feedly via the search box.\n</p>\n<figure class=\"webfeeds-frame-simple webfeeds-size-large\"><img src=\"http://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screenshot-2018-09-04-21.17.19.png\"><p></p>\n<p></p>\n<figcaption></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h2>The fifty most interesting sources</h2>\n<p>The second discovery challenge is to find the fifty most interesting sources someone researching any topic might want to follow.</p>\n<p>Ranking sources is hard because not all sources are equal. In tech as an example, you have mainstream publications like The Verge or TechCrunch, expert voices like Ben Thompson, and lots of B-list noisy sources which don&#8217;t add much value.</p>\n<p>In addition, for niche topics like virtual reality, some sources are specific to VR while others cover a range of related topics.</p>\n<p>To solve this challenge, we created a model which looks at sources through three different lenses:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>follower count</li>\n<li>relevance (how focused is the source on the given topic)</li>\n<li>engagement (a proxy for quality and attention)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The outcome is new search result cards. You can explore the fifty most interesting sources for a given topic and sort them using the lens that is most important to you.\n</p>\n<figure class=\"webfeeds-frame-simple webfeeds-size-large\"><img src=\"http://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screenshot-2018-09-04-21.21.10.png\"><p></p>\n<p></p>\n<figcaption></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h2>Neighborhoods</h2>\n<p>One of the benefits of the new topic model is that the 2,000 topics are organized in a hierarchy. This makes it easy for you to zoom in or out and explore many different neighborhoods of the Web.\n</p>\n<figure class=\"webfeeds-frame-simple webfeeds-size-large\"><img src=\"http://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screen-Shot-2018-08-27-at-1.50.03-PM.png\"><p></p>\n<p></p>\n<figcaption></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>For example, from the cybersecurity topic, you can jump to a list of related topics that let you dig deeper into malware, forensics, or privacy.\n</p>\n<figure class=\"webfeeds-frame-simple webfeeds-size-large\"><img src=\"http://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screenshot-2018-09-04-21.22.57.png\"><p></p>\n<p></p>\n<figcaption></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h2>One more thing…</h2>\n<p>We have done a lot of research over the last four years to understand how people discover new sources. One insight we learned is that people often co-read certain sources. For example, if you are interested in art, design, and pop culture and you follow Fubiz, there is a high chance that you also follow Designboom.</p>\n<p>With that in mind, we spent some time creating a model that learns what sources are often co-read. The idea is that a user could enter a source that they love and discover another source they could pair it with.</p>\n<p>You can learn more about the machine learning model (we call it feed2vec) powering this experience through <a href=\"https://blog.feedly.com/data-science-behind-recommendations-in-feedly/\">the article Paul published here</a>.</p>\n<p>As a user, you can access this feature by searching in the discover page for a source you love to read. The result will be a list of sources which are often co-read with that source.\n</p>\n<figure class=\"webfeeds-frame-simple webfeeds-size-large\"><img src=\"http://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screenshot-2018-09-04-21.25.47.png\"><p></p>\n<p></p>\n<figcaption></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h2>Thank you!</h2>\n<p>I would like to thank Paul, Michelle, Mathieu, and Aymeric for the great research work they did to take this project from zero to one. People who have tried to tackle discovery know that it is a very hard challenge and the results of this project have been very impressive.</p>\n<p>We would also like to thank the community for participating in the Battle of the Sources experiment. Your input was key in helping us learn how to model the source ranking. We are going to continue to invest in discovery and we look forward to continuing to collaborate with you.</p>\n<p>We would also like to thank Dan Newman, Daron Brewood, Enrico, Joey, Lior, Paul Adams, Ryan Murphy, and Joseph Thornley from the Lab for reviewing an earlier version of this article.</p>                </div>\n            \n\n           ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 06 Mar 2019 01:13:41 +0000","feedId":887,"bgimg":"http://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screenshot-2018-09-04-22.13.47.png","linkMd5":"773f3dde296b4459c06c59d7ec75d3e3","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn78@2020_6/2020/08/16/13-38-37-645_5abfe49c33cddb57.webp","destWidth":1832,"destHeight":1536,"author":"Edwin K","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screenshot-2018-09-04-22.13.47.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn66@2020_2/2020/08/16/13-38-50-265_5abfe49c33cddb57.webp","http://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screenshot-2018-09-04-21.17.19.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn80@2020_5/2020/08/16/13-38-49-867_63d4fffcf77ce8b5.webp","http://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screenshot-2018-09-04-21.21.10.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn4@2020_2/2020/08/16/13-38-55-209_751dfc871eedf405.webp","http://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screen-Shot-2018-08-27-at-1.50.03-PM.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn84@2020_1/2020/08/16/13-38-43-032_75a11f3a2242160e.webp","http://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screenshot-2018-09-04-21.22.57.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn91@2020_5/2020/08/16/13-38-43-053_57a1bcb88b0c22ca.webp","http://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screenshot-2018-09-04-21.25.47.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn90@2020_5/2020/08/16/13-38-51-808_7951e5bb1d42b95f.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 21:38:35","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 21:38:35","title":"Safari Viewer, San Francisco and 3D touch – New feedly for iOS","link":"http://blog.feedly.com/?p=7099","description":"\n              \n                <div>\n                  <div class=\"webfeeds-header\">\n                                                            <div class=\"webfeeds-header__title\"><!-- injected by client --></div>\n                                      </div>\n                  <p><a class=\"a2a_button_facebook\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.feedly.com%2Fsafari-view-san-francisco-and-3d-touch-new-feedly-for-ios%2F&#38;linkname=Safari%20Viewer%2C%20San%20Francisco%20and%203D%20touch%20%E2%80%93%20New%20feedly%20for%20iOS\" title=\"Facebook\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_twitter\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.feedly.com%2Fsafari-view-san-francisco-and-3d-touch-new-feedly-for-ios%2F&#38;linkname=Safari%20Viewer%2C%20San%20Francisco%20and%203D%20touch%20%E2%80%93%20New%20feedly%20for%20iOS\" title=\"Twitter\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_linkedin\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.feedly.com%2Fsafari-view-san-francisco-and-3d-touch-new-feedly-for-ios%2F&#38;linkname=Safari%20Viewer%2C%20San%20Francisco%20and%203D%20touch%20%E2%80%93%20New%20feedly%20for%20iOS\" title=\"LinkedIn\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_buffer\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/buffer?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.feedly.com%2Fsafari-view-san-francisco-and-3d-touch-new-feedly-for-ios%2F&#38;linkname=Safari%20Viewer%2C%20San%20Francisco%20and%203D%20touch%20%E2%80%93%20New%20feedly%20for%20iOS\" title=\"Buffer\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"></a></p><p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"visual alignnone wp-image-7100 size-full\" src=\"https://blog1.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screenshot-2015-10-21-09-00-08.png\" alt=\"feedly for iOS 9\" width=\"660\" height=\"448\" srcset=\"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screenshot-2015-10-21-09-00-08.png 822w, https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screenshot-2015-10-21-09-00-08-300x204.png 300w, https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screenshot-2015-10-21-09-00-08-768x521.png 768w, https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screenshot-2015-10-21-09-00-08-800x543.png 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">The new feedly for iOS is available for download in the App Store.

Some teams use the API to extract data about threats and vulnerabilities and feed larger machine learning threat-prioritization models. Some teams use the API to create Jira tickets based on the content of the Feedly boards to make sure that critical vulnerabilities are reviews and patched in a timely manner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Access to the Feedly API (up to 200,000 requests per month) is an add-on included in the Enterprise Edition of the Feedly for Cybersecurity package.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-gts-feedly-button webfeeds-actions\"><h2><div class=\"title\"></div><span class=\"sub\"></span></h2><p><a href=\"https://feedly.typeform.com/to/zTSWjL\" class=\"button accent\">TRY FEEDLY FOR CYBERSECURITY</a></p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>In this tutorial, we will show you how to use the Feedly API to access the content of your security feeds, your boards, and your Leo priorities.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Authentication</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When you subscribe to Feedly for Cybersecurity Enterprise Edition, we will provide you with a special Feedly access token associated with your account.

The entities represent CVEs, products, or companies Leo has identified in the article. The CVE entity includes CVSS and exploits information extracted from vulnerability databases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The estimatedCVSS represents the result of Leo’s CVSS scoring model. This is useful for zero-days and articles which do not mention a CVE explicitly. In those cases, Leo reads the content of the article and computes an approximative CVSS score based on the terminology used in the article or the tweet.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gts-feedly-image wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"webfeeds-frame-simple\"><img src=\"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/json-leo-enrichment.png\"/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><figcaption>Leo enrichment of the article</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Pro tip: When you have an article open in the Feedly web application, you can use the Shift+D keyboard shortcut to see and inspect the JSON of the article.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gts-feedly-image wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"webfeeds-frame-simple\"><img src=\"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/shift-d-show-article-json.png\"/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><figcaption>Use keyboard shortcut SHIFT+D to see the preview of the article JSON</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Accessing the content of your feeds</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s imagine that you have a “Security News” feed which contains a list of known and trusted security sources you want to follow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Feedly API allows you to query Feedly and ask for the last 100 articles aggregated in that feed. The articles are normalized in a JSON format which includes the title, the content, the source information, as well as all some cybersecurity metadata (Leo topics classification, CVE metadata, CVSS metadata, exploit information.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can use the <a href=\"https://developer.feedly.com/v3/streams/\">Stream endpoint</a> to get the last 100 articles published in a feed:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gts-feedly-image wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"webfeeds-frame-simple\"><img src=\"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/stream-api.png\"/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><figcaption>Overview of the stream endpoint</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The most important parameter is the streamId</strong>. Each feed in your Feedly account has a unique stream id. When you select the feed in the left navigation bar, you see the streamId as part of the URL.

The app can enrich the ticket with the URL of the article saved in the board, the CVE information, and the notes and highlights from the researcher.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a powerful way to break the silos between your research team and your operations team and make sure that critical vulnerabilities are patched faster.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pro tip: there is a simple solution to finding the new articles saved in a board. When your app processes a list of articles, it should save the first article in the list and the next time it uses the Stream Feedly app to get the latest articles bookmarked to a board, your app can use the <strong>newerThan parameter</strong> of the /v3/stream/content and pass that article id instead of a timestamp to get newer articles.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>A lot more…</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Feedly web application and mobile applications are built on top of the Feedly API.

It’s easy to get overwhelmed or miss a crucial market development.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or maybe you want to cut out the COVID-19 content altogether so you can find out what else is happening around the world.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we’ve taught Leo, <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://blog.feedly.com/leo/\" target=\"_blank\">your AI research assistant</a>, how to help.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-gts-feedly-button webfeeds-actions\"><h2><div class=\"title\"></div><span class=\"sub\"></span></h2><p><a href=\"https://feedly.com/i/pro/covid-19\" class=\"button accent\">GET LEO NOW</a></p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Mute or prioritize COVID-19 in your Feedly</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Leo can already learn what you like to see and refine your Feedly. Now, he can mute or prioritize COVID-19 as well. And he does it across tens of millions of trusted sources.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>It works just like Leo’s other prioritization parameters such as keywords, topics, and events</strong>. ‘Coronavirus’ and ‘COVID-19’ are just two of the terms he recognizes. Leo takes into account a variety of the virus’s other names, too, like SARS-CoV-2.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gts-feedly-image wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"webfeeds-frame-simple webfeeds-size-large\"><img src=\"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screenshot-1-_-Covid-19-Aliases.png\"/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><figcaption>Leo prioritizes mentions of COVID-19 and its wide variety of aliases</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you give Leo a priority, you’ll get a specific view of how your industry is reacting to the pandemic. Then just save the most interesting articles in your Feedly Board.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can <strong>mute or prioritize one feed, or every feed</strong>, <strong>and those feeds can be personal or spread across your team</strong>. It lets some team members focus on COVID-19 news if they need to, while others look beyond it.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s a few examples to show how Leo’s coronavirus topic might work for you. After all, the virus is impacting every sector, whether you’re in retail, cyberspace, automotive or pharmaceuticals&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>COVID-19 and biopharma</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You’re a drug development director looking for news and insight around cardiovascular disease, and how COVID-19 is affecting this research.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s imagine you have a cardiology feed in Feedly, and you’re following multiple science and medicine journals. <strong>Go to your cardiology feed and hit &#8220;Train Leo&#8221; in the right-hand corner.</strong> You can prioritize COVID-19 subjects by entering it as a topic.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gts-feedly-image wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"webfeeds-frame-simple webfeeds-size-large\"><img src=\"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screenshot-2-_-Pharma-_-Cardiology.png\"/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><figcaption>Preview the prioritized COVID-19 articles in your cardiology feed</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The articles displayed are now all about coronavirus and cardiology.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Refine the priority further with +AND or +OR</strong>. <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://blog.feedly.com/leo-and-topics/\" target=\"_blank\">Here’s some more information about Leo’s topic combinations.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>COVID-19 and cybersecurity</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You’re part of a large tech company. Security threats may have emerged during the pandemic, buried by the noise online.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do the exact same thing. Click ‘Train Leo’ and enter COVID-19 as the topic.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gts-feedly-image wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"webfeeds-frame-simple webfeeds-size-large\"><img src=\"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screenshot-3-_-Cybersecurity.png\"/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><figcaption>Preview the prioritized COVID-19 articles in your threat research feed</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You can see the most recent coronavirus-related articles from your sources in the preview. Choose whether to filter by Entire Content or titles that explicitly contain COVID-19 or its aliases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>New threats to your business can then be spotted and prepared for.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>COVID-19 and retail</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You’re a business intelligence analyst searching for COVID-19’s effects on stores and brands around the globe. Retail, one of the most disrupted sectors, is under intense scrutiny. The prioritization feature can help here too.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a retail feed, you’ll preview countless pieces of content that tackle this subject.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, just create a Leo priority around COVID-19.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gts-feedly-image wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"webfeeds-frame-simple webfeeds-size-large\"><img src=\"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screenshot-4-_-Retail.png\"/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><figcaption>Preview the prioritized COVID-19 articles in your Retail feed</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And that’s it. You have a feed at the intersection of two subjects, with plenty of room for more priorities and further refinement.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Muting COVID-19</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You might want to look past COVID-19 instead, and keep it out of your feeds.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Muting is just as easy. <strong>Click ‘Train Leo’ and scroll to ‘Mute Filters’</strong>. Type in COVID-19. You’ll see a message asking which Feedly feeds you want to remove it from. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s how it looks in a tech feed.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gts-feedly-image wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"webfeeds-frame-simple webfeeds-size-large\"><img src=\"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screenshot-5-_-Mute-Filter-Tech.png\"/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><figcaption>Preview the muted COVID-19 articles in your tech feed</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>No more content on the topic will turn up in your Feedly, as long as the mute is active. It’s one of <a href=\"https://blog.feedly.com/leo-and-mute-filters/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">1,000 pre-trained topics that Leo can mute right away</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Train Leo to prioritize or mute COVID-19 now</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Whatever happens with coronavirus and your market, the trusted insights are here.

We hear it at conferences, in LinkedIn forums, in team meetings, on Twitter, and on billboards.</p>\n<p>With social experiences like Twitter and Facebook becoming core to the web, this concept of social selling has become a definitive new approach for the ways that organizations think about building relationships. It is a methodology that embraces at its center a driving belief for us at feedly: Content is a currency. That is, that high quality content is more than just an entertaining read. Content builds relationships, drives business, and steers innovation.</p>\n<p>In fact, as we’ve talked with more and more of you as part of our regular product development process, we’ve learned that many of you are using feedly as a core content engine to drive your social selling. Many of you are using feedly as your main hub to organize your favorite sources, feed yourself with daily reading, and then deciminate the best stories to your customers.</p>\n<h2>But just what is social selling?</h2>\n<p>Social selling is the idea of using content—mostly online—to help educate prospective customers, build a relationship with them, and help guide them to a purchase decision.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-7841\"></span></p>\n<p>Sometimes this means that sales people build personas and share relevant information through social channels like LinkedIn, Twitter, YouTube, and more. Sometimes it means emailing interesting, relevant content to prospective customers. All of these activities overlap with a bunch of other trends that people have been buzzing about: sales enablement, employee advocacy, personal branding, social media marketing, content marketing, inbound marketing, and more.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkap9qDYnlY</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a class=\"callforaction\" href=\"https://goo.gl/TQj0XN\" target=\"new\">Learn more about Social Selling and feedly</a></p>\n<p>A salesperson at a content marketing company, for instance, might share content on her LinkedIn about why good content is important.

Do you have enough information to determine if an article is worth opening?</p>\n<p><strong>Question 5.</strong> Do you have any additional feedback on how we could make these views more useful and productive for you?</p>\n<p>Looking forward to talking more about this in the Lab Slack channel!</p>\n<p><em>What did we learn from <a href=\"https://blog.feedly.com/experiment-01-smooth-scrolling/\">Experiment 01 &#8211; smooth scrolling</a>? </em></p>\n<p>We want to thank the 200+ people who installed the Lab app and joined the Lab Slack. Your feedback and bug reports have been super useful.</p>\n<p>We fixed most of the bugs as part of the new experience.</p>\n<p>We also asked the design team to explore the two most pressing issues reported by the community: 1/ the ability to mark articles in batch and 2/ re-enforcing the feeling that the today page is not infinite. We will start sharing some design ideas on Slack shortly.</p>\n<p>-Edwin</p>\n<p>Love the Web?

Scroll through your Today stream, and then let us know if the new scrolling experience feels better than the current paged scrolling.</p>\n<p><strong>Question 2. </strong>On average, how many articles can you scroll through before your eyes get tired?</p>\n<p>Looking forward to talking more about this in the Lab Slack channel!

Today we&#8217;d like to showcase a member of the feedly community who uses it as a curator of digital art, a burgeoning sector. Ryan Cowdrey, of the young startup <a href=\"http://23Vivi.com\" target=\"_blank\">23VIVI.com</a>, shows us how you can use feedly to leverage content as an art curator. He provides a guest post for us today.</em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My name is Ryan Cowdrey and I’m the Director of Curation at <a href=\"http://23Vivi.com\" target=\"_blank\">23VIVI.com</a>, an online marketplace that offers rare and limited edition digital art. For your enjoyment, I pose the question:</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“With so much digital media content at one’s fingertips at all times, how does a creative individual discover the latest trends amongst all the noise out there?”</span></p></blockquote>\n<p>Being an art curator in the digital age requires strategic tools for effectively treading through the massive amount of content that we can access. Curators are relying more and more on internet sources to get content updates that they need on a daily basis. (Blouin ArtInfo, ArtNet News, Design Collector, Fubiz, BOMB Magazine, Colossal, to name a few.)</p>\n<p>Not to mention that if you curate digital art exclusively, you are now relying solely on internet sources to get your art fix. The tools that one uses to augment their curation efforts will set them apart from the rest.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-7808\"></span></p>\n<p>As a digital art curator at 23VIVI.com, I follow upwards of 30 big-time art magazines to stay up to date on art creation and news. After implementing feedly into my daily routine, I can now consume double the amount of content in less time.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a class=\"callforaction\" href=\"https://goo.gl/XsxunU\" target=\"new\">Get our <b>State of Content Marketing report</b></a></p>\n<p>Pre-feedly, I was literally using an Excel spreadsheet to keep track of all the magazines that I was visiting weekly. I would record what site I was visiting, the day I last checked it, and the title of the last article, so I could pick up where I left off. Sound like a hassle? IT WAS!!!</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7820\" src=\"http://blog1.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/screen-shot-2016-03-28-at-5-38-34-pm.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2016-03-28 at 5.38.34 PM\" width=\"1362\" height=\"744\" srcset=\"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/screen-shot-2016-03-28-at-5-38-34-pm.png 1362w, https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/screen-shot-2016-03-28-at-5-38-34-pm-300x164.png 300w, https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/screen-shot-2016-03-28-at-5-38-34-pm-768x420.png 768w, https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/screen-shot-2016-03-28-at-5-38-34-pm-1024x559.png 1024w, https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/screen-shot-2016-03-28-at-5-38-34-pm-1200x656.png 1200w, https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/screen-shot-2016-03-28-at-5-38-34-pm-800x437.png 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1362px) 100vw, 1362px\" /></p>\n<p>After being introduced to feedly, I honestly lost 10 pounds of stress. It was by far the easiest, most effective tool I use to augment my career. Not only do I follow those same magazines that I was already subscribing to, but I was exposed to countless other publications that feedly offers in my space… and now they are all in one place. Along with that, I did away with the email subscriptions, which were immensely cluttering my workflow. Not to mention, I don’t risk ever missing a single article or post, which is imperative to my profession.</p>\n<p>The typical curator goes to school to study Art History and might apprentice under a known curator until they have the skills to put on their own exhibitions.</p>\n<p>We are in a new era of digital art, though, that doesn’t require all the technical training. One has an Art History degree at their fingertips at most libraries. Many big-name curators can be followed on social media, where you can get a feel for their curation efforts.</p>\n<p>So, it ultimately comes down to getting your hands on lots of content, so that you can begin noticing trends, formulating hypotheses, and putting together thought-provoking collections.</p>\n<p>On my path to becoming a “curatorial expert,” I’m relying on feedly to feed my content needs—much like Indiana Jones relied on his whip—haha! To avoid limiting my hunger for creative ideas, I use feedly’s Collection feature to break up my content and feed into various categories: Photography, Physical Design, Graphic Design, Art News, Pop-Culture, and Visual Art. This allows me to not only keep things organized but also easily pull influences from various art mediums.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7819\" src=\"http://blog1.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/screen-shot-2016-03-28-at-1-23-41-am1.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2016-03-28 at 1.23.41 AM\" width=\"1356\" height=\"641\" srcset=\"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/screen-shot-2016-03-28-at-1-23-41-am1.png 1356w, https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/screen-shot-2016-03-28-at-1-23-41-am1-300x142.png 300w, https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/screen-shot-2016-03-28-at-1-23-41-am1-768x363.png 768w, https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/screen-shot-2016-03-28-at-1-23-41-am1-1024x484.png 1024w, https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/screen-shot-2016-03-28-at-1-23-41-am1-1200x567.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1356px) 100vw, 1356px\" /></p>\n<p>Because I swim through so much content on a daily basis, it is very easy to get lost in the immensity. To augment this problem I use the tag and “save for later” features to create collections of art that work well together. I can easily communicate with my team what my thoughts are on our newest curated collection and show what influences me.</p>\n<p>With feedly, anyone with an aptitude for creativity, noticing patterns, and expressing their thoughts through creation can become a digital art curator.</p>\n<p>Contributed by Ryan Cowdrey, Director of Curation at <a href=\"http://23VIVI.com\" target=\"_blank\">23VIVI.com</a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a class=\"callforaction\" href=\"https://goo.gl/XsxunU\" target=\"new\">Get our <b>State of Content Marketing report</b></a></p>\n                </div>\n            \n\n           ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 30 Mar 2016 14:00:59 +0000","feedId":887,"bgimg":"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/unnamed1.png","linkMd5":"05f8679b1edc739d3fadc513e3d44de3","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn62@2020_1/2020/08/16/13-38-37-754_948f09f5dbf4178e.webp","destWidth":2048,"destHeight":2048,"author":"feedly","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/unnamed1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn16@2020_1/2020/08/16/13-38-42-335_948f09f5dbf4178e.webp","http://blog1.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/screen-shot-2016-03-28-at-5-38-34-pm.png":null,"http://blog1.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/screen-shot-2016-03-28-at-1-23-41-am1.png":null}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 21:38:35","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 21:38:35","title":"Leo understands genes","link":"https://blog.feedly.com/?p=14014","description":"\n              \n                <div>\n                  <div class=\"webfeeds-header\">\n                      <img class=\"webfeeds-header__illustration webfeedsFeaturedVisual\" src=\"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/genes-leo@2x.png\" width=\"552\" height=\"440\" />                                        <div class=\"webfeeds-header__title\"><!-- injected by client --></div>\n                    <div class=\"webfeeds-header__subtitle\">Research genes and learn more about the latest breakthroughs more efficiently.</div>                  </div>\n                  <p><a class=\"a2a_button_facebook\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.feedly.com%2Fleo-understands-genes%2F&#38;linkname=Leo%20understands%20genes\" title=\"Facebook\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_twitter\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.feedly.com%2Fleo-understands-genes%2F&#38;linkname=Leo%20understands%20genes\" title=\"Twitter\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_linkedin\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.feedly.com%2Fleo-understands-genes%2F&#38;linkname=Leo%20understands%20genes\" title=\"LinkedIn\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_buffer\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/buffer?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.feedly.com%2Fleo-understands-genes%2F&#38;linkname=Leo%20understands%20genes\" title=\"Buffer\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"></a></p>\n<p>Drug development is a highly competitive space and the information about gene innovations is scattered across multiples sources, which makes the gene scouting process time consuming and tedious.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are excited to announce that you can now <strong>prioritize genes</strong> with Leo, your AI research assistant.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-gts-feedly-button webfeeds-actions\"><h2><div class=\"title\"></div><span class=\"sub\"></span></h2><p><a href=\"https://feedly.typeform.com/to/chB0Eq?utm_source=xxxxx#id=xxxxx&#38;email=xxxxx&#38;wave=xxxxx&#38;plan=xxxxx&#38;enterprisename=xxxxx&#38;name=xxxxx&#38;feature=xxxxx\" class=\"button accent\">TRY FEEDLY FOR BIOPHARMA</a></p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s walk through an example of how you could use Leo to prioritize a gene. Imagine you lead a research program about immuno-oncology at a biotech startup and you want to track any updates about IL33.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Cut through the noise</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You can train Leo to read your biopharma feeds and prioritize articles related to IL33.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gts-feedly-image wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"webfeeds-frame-simple webfeeds-size-large\"><img src=\"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1-Leo-understands-genes.png\"/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><figcaption>Leo prioritizes IL33 in your biopharma feeds</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Leo continuously reads the thousands of articles published in your feeds. It’s an efficient way to cut through the noise and keep up with the latest news about methodologies and clinical trials.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>You&#8217;re in control</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve trained Leo to understand <strong><strong>42,000 genes </strong>and <strong>185,000 aliases</strong> from the <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/\">NCBI database</a></strong>. This database belongs to the US National Library of Medicine and is used by leading websites such as PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Asking Leo to prioritize &#8220;IL33&#8221; in any of your biopharma feeds is as simple as creating a new Topic priority and selecting &#8220;IL33&#8221; as the topic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you create an &#8220;IL33&#8221; priority, Leo will be looking for <strong>all the aliases of &#8220;IL33</strong>&#8220;.

As such, Cloudflare informed us it is possible that some of the Feedly Web request performed between Feb 13 and Feb 18 might have been impacted by the information leak.</p>\n<p>Despite the 1 in 3,300,000 chances of being impacted, <strong>we recommend to be extra cautious</strong> and take the following actions:</p>\n<p>1/<strong> If you are using the Feedly login/password, change your password</strong>.<strong> </strong>Go to the <a href=\"https://feedly.com/i/logins\">Logins page</a> and change your password. Note: if you are using a third-party login option like Google, Facebook, or Twitter, you are NOT impacted and do not need to change your password [1].</p>\n<p>2/ <strong>Logout and log back in.</strong> On Feedly Web, click on the face bubble icon (at the top right of the screen), select the logout option and then log back in. This will invalidate your old session/cookies and create a brand new one.</p>\n<p>Our engineering team has a follow up call with the Cloudflare team later this afternoon and we will update this post if we learn anything that changes these recommendations.</p>\n<p>We want to thank the Cloudflare team for how well they handled this situation. It is how you manage exceptions that defines your brand, and Cloudflare did really well despite what might have been a very stressful moment for them. We look forward to continuing to work with them to make Feedly safer and more reliable.</p>\n<p>Please let us know if you have any questions.</p>\n<p>-Seb, David, and Edwin</p>\n<p>[1] The third party login authentication is performed via OAuth. You login directly with those 3rd party sites and Feedly only gets an authentication token. One of the benefits of OAuth is that Feedly or Cloudflare never get to see your third party passwords.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n                </div>\n            \n\n           ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 24 Feb 2017 20:24:23 +0000","feedId":887,"bgimg":"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Data-469973742.jpg","linkMd5":"2ef577bfdcb5e8c690866bf090eb3631","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn57@2020_6/2020/08/16/13-38-37-514_87c5802185b9515f.webp","destWidth":1336,"destHeight":935,"author":"Edwin K","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Data-469973742.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn95@2020_5/2020/08/16/13-38-45-557_87c5802185b9515f.webp","https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Data-469973742-1024x717.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn23@2020_6/2020/08/16/13-38-53-486_c77134f722ac925c.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 21:38:35","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 21:38:35","title":"Introducing Feedly for Biopharma","link":"https://blog.feedly.com/?p=13965","description":"\n              \n                <div>\n                  <div class=\"webfeeds-header\">\n                      <img class=\"webfeeds-header__illustration webfeedsFeaturedVisual\" src=\"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/feedly-leo-master_biopharma@3x-1-1.png\" width=\"828\" height=\"660\" />                                        <div class=\"webfeeds-header__title\"><!-- injected by client --></div>\n                    <div class=\"webfeeds-header__subtitle\">Streamline your biopharma intelligence.</div>                  </div>\n                  <p><a class=\"a2a_button_facebook\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.feedly.com%2Fintroducing-feedly-for-biopharma%2F&#38;linkname=Introducing%20Feedly%20for%20Biopharma\" title=\"Facebook\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_twitter\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.feedly.com%2Fintroducing-feedly-for-biopharma%2F&#38;linkname=Introducing%20Feedly%20for%20Biopharma\" title=\"Twitter\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_linkedin\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.feedly.com%2Fintroducing-feedly-for-biopharma%2F&#38;linkname=Introducing%20Feedly%20for%20Biopharma\" title=\"LinkedIn\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_buffer\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/buffer?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.feedly.com%2Fintroducing-feedly-for-biopharma%2F&#38;linkname=Introducing%20Feedly%20for%20Biopharma\" title=\"Buffer\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"></a></p>\n<p>Today, we’re excited to launch Feedly for Biopharma to help biopharma professionals cut through the noise.

In Experiment 07, we are sharing with you some ideas we have around how the iPad compact, text-only, magazine, and cards view might look like.</p>\n<figure class=\"webfeeds-frame-simple webfeeds-size-large\"><img src=\"http://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screenshot-2018-09-24-21.17.08.png\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<p><em>Questions for the community</em></p>\n<p><strong>Question 1</strong> &#8211; Are you satisfied with how the new mobile views look on the iPad and Android Tablets?</p>\n<p><strong>Question 2</strong> &#8211; Are you satisfied by the new navigation model and the side-by-side implementation?</p>\n<p>We look forward to your feedback on the #ipad slack channel.</p>\n<h2>Power Search</h2>\n<p>Power Search is the ability for you to search for specific articles in your Feedly feeds and boards. You can think of it as a personalized search engine focusing only on the sources you trust. It is one of the top Feedly Pro features. In Experiment 07, we implemented a mobile-friendly version of the experience available on the Web.</p>\n<figure class=\"webfeeds-frame-simple webfeeds-size-large\"><img src=\"http://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screenshot-2018-09-24-21.14.48.png\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Like on the Web, you can use <a href=\"https://blog.feedly.com/find-and-filter-the-best-content-on-the-web-with-power-search/\">operators</a> (AND, OR, quotes, etc..) to refine your searches and use filters to narrow the result to the right sources, content time or popularity.</p>\n<p><em>Questions for the Pro community</em></p>\n<p><strong>Question 3</strong> &#8211; Are you satisfied with the new mobile Power Search user experience? Where you able to easily find a specific article in your Feedly?</p>\n<p><strong>Question 4</strong> &#8211; Is there a feature we could add to Power Search to make it more useful to you?</p>\n<p>Please join the 07-power-search channel on Slack if you would like to discuss the Power Search feature with the product team.</p>\n<h2>Settings</h2>\n<p>As part of the continuous polish effort, we added settings support. You can now access the settings panel from the bottom of the left navigation bar and customize: the theme, the start page, the auto-mark-as-read behavior, the default view, and many more features.</p>\n<figure class=\"webfeeds-frame-simple webfeeds-size-large\"><img src=\"http://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screenshot-2018-09-24-21.13.05.png\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<h2>Paged-Scrolling</h2>\n<p>The lack of paged scrolling has been one of the biggest &#8220;snakes&#8221; in the new design. About 10 % of the users seem to prefer paged scrolling to the new smooth scrolling. We decided last week to try to understand more. We created a private Slack channel with the 75 people who were not satisfied with the new smooth scrolling. Through these conversations, we learned that what users really liked about the old experience is that it made it easy to not over-scroll or under-scroll and empowered users to scroll through content faster.</p>\n<figure class=\"webfeeds-frame-simple \"><img src=\"http://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screenshot-2018-09-24-20.56.10.png\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<p>As part of Experiment 7, we are pushing out an idea a few users suggested: it would be nice to have a preference which would allow you to have some kind of intelligent scrolling that would automatically stop at the right place.</p>\n<p>If you go to the new settings panel, you will see a &#8220;Paged&#8221; scrolling option that should allow you to play with this idea.</p>\n<p><em>Question to the community</em></p>\n<p><strong>Question 5</strong> &#8211; If you are part of the &#8220;I miss the old scrolling&#8221; camp, is this option enough to remove all the frustration caused by the lack of productivity? Let us know in the 01-scrolling channel</p>\n<h2>Upgrade to Pro</h2>\n<p>As part of Experiment 07, we now allow non-pro users to upgrade to Pro and either unlock some interesting feature or just back Feedly. To thank the Lab community, this mobile upgrade to Pro offers a free 30-day trial.</p>\n<figure class=\"webfeeds-frame-simple webfeeds-size-large\"><img src=\"http://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screenshot-2018-09-24-21.13.36.png\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<p><em>Question to the community</em></p>\n<p><strong>Question 6</strong> &#8211; If you end up trying the upgrade experience, please let us know what you think and if there are friction points we could remove.</p>\n<p><strong>Question 7</strong> &#8211; If you are not a Pro user, please let us know if there is a feature we could add to the Pro offering to inspire you to upgrade!</p>\n<p>Please use the 08-pro Slack channel for all the Pro related conversations.</p>\n<h2>Next Three Weeks</h2>\n<p>The focus of the next 3 weeks is to finalize the iPad implementation and polish as much as we can.</p>\n<p><strong>Question 8</strong> &#8211; If you still see any gaps preventing you from using the new Lab app as your primary reading/research experience, we would love to hear about them.</p>\n<p>We would like to thank once again everyone in the Lab community for participating in this giant experiment and helping us design the best Feedly possible. Your feedback and ideas help us better understand how you use the product and how to optimize and refine our decisions.</p>\n<p>-Edwin, Petr, and Emily</p>\n<p>Love the Web?

Common problems &#38; solutions:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>No new articles saved since the last newsletter sent. It will only send if there are new articles available (ie. saved) in the board.</li>\n<li><strong>Solution:</strong> For now, we suggest removing and then re-saving some articles to the board. After that, return to the <a href=\"https://feedly.com/i/team/newsletters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">newsletter dashboard</a> and hit “send now” once again.</li>\n<li>It works the same way the very first time you activate a newsletter and for your future scheduled newsletters.</li>\n<li>Maybe the newsletter is in spam.</li>\n<li><strong>Solution:</strong> Please check your spam folder and add <strong>&#60;teams@feedly.com&#62;</strong> to your address book. That will tell your email provider to deliver newsletters to your inbox.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>What articles will (or won’t) be included in the newsletter when I hit Send Now?</strong></p>\n<p>On-demand newsletters only include new articles saved since the last newsletter sent. This is the most common reason why a newsletter doesn’t send.</p>\n<p>To send an on-demand newsletter with specific articles, we suggest removing and then re-saving those articles to the board. After that, return to the <a href=\"https://feedly.com/i/team/newsletters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">newsletter dashboard</a> and hit “send now” once again.</p>\n<p><strong>What about analytics?</strong></p>\n<p>Coming soon <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/1f642.png\" alt=\"🙂\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /></p>\n<p><strong>How do I add newsletters to my Feedly account?</strong></p>\n<p>We suggest starting a <a href=\"https://feedly.com/i/landing/team?utm_source=blog&#38;utm_medium=launch&#38;utm_campaign=on-demand-newsletter\">30-day free trial</a> of Feedly Teams.

In our &#8220;<a href=\"https://goo.gl/XsxunU\" target=\"_blank\">State of Content Marketing</a>&#8221; report, one in five marketers reported distribution as a top challenge.</p>\n<p>So just how do you distribute content these days?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a class=\"callforaction\" href=\"https://goo.gl/XsxunU\" target=\"new\">Get our <b>State of Content Marketing report</b></a></p>\n<p>We went to three companies with thriving content marketing strategies—Buffer, Help Scout, and InVision—and asked them about their distribution strategies.</p>\n<p>Here are seven ways to distribute your content.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-7681\"></span></p>\n<h2>1. Social</h2>\n<p>Despite recent conversations that it has become increasingly important to earn attention on social media because of the changing algorithms that encourage brands and publishers to use paid social ads, brands are continuing to use social as a primary channel for content distribution. “Social traffic is definitely down for us,” says Kevan Lee, content crafter at Buffer. “At the same time, it’s our second biggest referrer source. Still we get about 100k or so a month from social. That one is definitely significant.”</p>\n<h2>2. SEO</h2>\n<p>Sure, SEO is a long play that can take months to deliver benefits. But over time it can become the gift that keeps on giving. Forward-thinking blogs still report that SEO is key to their audience traffic. For some, this is a deliberate strategy that they have invest in over time. For others, it has been a product of a bigger commitment to quality content.</p>\n<p>Buffer has seen tons of traffic originating from search. “Having written the longer form content and writing it focused on specific topics has been a good strategy—though I’m not sure if I’d call it a strategy,” says Lee. “I’m not sure if we set out to do it necessarily but it ended up working out that way.”</p>\n<h2>3. Social Ads</h2>\n<p>In recent months, the feed algorithms at major social networks have continued to morph, making it harder for business content to stand out without the help of paid social ads. It takes some experimenting with your content and audience—and some mulah—but social ads is another way to increase the reach of your content.</p>\n<p>InVision spends about $4000 per month on content promotion various social media channels, including Linkedin, Facebook, Twitter, and other industry-specific outlets like Dribbble, according to head of content at InVision, Clair Byrd. “It’s not a lot of money,” she says, “but it’s enough to understand what content works best and it helps us create more things that work best.</p>\n<h2>4. Email</h2>\n<p>Growing an email list for content is a great way to ensure that the people who are interested in your content are getting it sent straight to their email inbox.</p>\n<p>Buffer, for instance, has a list of 45k which it uses for distribution.</p>\n<p>InVision says that email is still its most powerful channel and does one overall content email a week—a piece of content that performs strongly. “They’re free, and they tell us a lot about what’s working,” says Byrd.</p>\n<p>InVision also send out a stand alone email for key content initiatives, depending on how bit the impact is for the company.</p>\n<p>“We run content like people run product,” says Byrd. “Everything is campaign based, and everything we can tear apart. So if we think that a release is going to be Tier 1, we will support the content just like the Tier 1 product.</p>\n<h2>5. Partnerships</h2>\n<p>Syndication partnerships with other blogs or publications are another way to engage a large audience that goes beyond your user population. “One of our main distribution channels that runs almost automatically is our partnership with the Huffington Post,” says Gregory Ciotti, content strategist at Help Scout. “We set up agreements with them and Business Insider. They’ll handpick something they want to run. We just require that they use real canonical tags to protect our search. They offer us a small byline that links back to HelpScout. So all of those are happening automatically. People  will overestimate how much traffic is sends back, but either way, it is helpful. Syndication is definitely fantastic.”</p>\n<h2>6. Content Submission Sites</h2>\n<p>There are many sites for communities to post interesting and relevant content. Dribbble, Quibb, and Reddit are just a few examples. For some content distribution strategies, it may make sense to participate in the conversations at these sites and to submit content in a way that helps the community.</p>\n<p>The key, of course, is to respect the site for what it is—a community—and to avoid spamming by truly becoming a part of it and taking part in the conversations.</p>\n<h2>7. Sponsored Content</h2>\n<p>Many brands are increasingly using sponsored content services, or native ad platforms, like Outbrain and Taboola. These services try to reach more people placing your content within online publications that reach a relevant audience or post about similar things. In addition to distribution, it can provide a method of testing the efficacy or your content among a known persona or help you explore what persona reacts well to your content.</p>\n<p>These are our experts’ six recommendations. What do you use to reach more people with your content?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a class=\"callforaction\" href=\"https://goo.gl/XsxunU\" target=\"new\">Get our <b>State of Content Marketing report</b></a></p>\n                </div>\n            \n\n           ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 15 Mar 2016 14:00:21 +0000","feedId":887,"bgimg":"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/content-distribution-e1491263015632.jpg","linkMd5":"cdb8390d4898c1fd095b0eae2719610a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx20/cdn71@2020_2/2020/08/16/13-38-36-156_a332935c75991b83.webp","destWidth":1000,"destHeight":557,"author":"feedly","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/content-distribution-e1491263015632.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn98@2020_1/2020/08/16/13-38-38-469_a332935c75991b83.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 21:38:35","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 21:38:35","title":"Trend Report: The Rise of Live Video Streaming","link":"http://blog.feedly.com/?p=7873","description":"\n              \n                <div>\n                  <div class=\"webfeeds-header\">\n                      <img class=\"webfeeds-header__illustration webfeedsFeaturedVisual\" src=\"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/DeathtoStock_Wired10.jpg\" width=\"5184\" height=\"3456\" />                                        <div class=\"webfeeds-header__title\"><!-- injected by client --></div>\n                                      </div>\n                  <p><a class=\"a2a_button_facebook\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.feedly.com%2Ftrend-report-the-rise-of-live-video-streaming%2F&#38;linkname=Trend%20Report%3A%20The%20Rise%20of%20Live%20Video%20Streaming\" title=\"Facebook\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_twitter\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.feedly.com%2Ftrend-report-the-rise-of-live-video-streaming%2F&#38;linkname=Trend%20Report%3A%20The%20Rise%20of%20Live%20Video%20Streaming\" title=\"Twitter\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_linkedin\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.feedly.com%2Ftrend-report-the-rise-of-live-video-streaming%2F&#38;linkname=Trend%20Report%3A%20The%20Rise%20of%20Live%20Video%20Streaming\" title=\"LinkedIn\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_buffer\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/buffer?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.feedly.com%2Ftrend-report-the-rise-of-live-video-streaming%2F&#38;linkname=Trend%20Report%3A%20The%20Rise%20of%20Live%20Video%20Streaming\" title=\"Buffer\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"></a></p><h2>The Trend: Live Video Streaming</h2>\n<p>In our increasingly digital and visual world, businesses across industries are fighting attention amidst the noise. Video as a medium has become one of the most effective ways to stand out and connect with an audience. Video quickly conveys meaning and emotion. It’s memorable, and it catches the eye in a sea of text and static images.</p>\n<p>To hit home the growing popularity of video: Over one billion people use Youtube (that’s almost one third of all people on the internet), and the number of daily Youtube viewers has increased 40 percent since March 2014.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, many social media sites like Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook have integrated some form of video content on their platforms. Additionally, new social media platforms have recently emerged that feature video as the central medium for interaction.</p>\n<p>More and more, brands are recognizing the value of video as an online marketing strategy. <a href=\"http://www.demandmetric.com/content/video-marketing-benchmark-report-0\" target=\"_blank\">Demand Metric</a> completed a survey of 398 marketing, sales, and business professionals which revealed that 69 percent have used video marketing and another 31 percent are planning to. A recent study of 200 executives by <a href=\"https://www.yourbrandlive.com/press/new-research-reveals-power-of-live-streaming-video-for-brands\" target=\"_blank\">Brandlive</a> found that 44 percent held a live streaming event in 2015 and 39 percent believe live streaming video will be important to their marketing efforts going forward.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a class=\"callforaction\" href=\"https://goo.gl/TQj0XN\" target=\"new\">Learn more about Social Selling and feedly</a></p>\n<p>The video trend is growing alongside the surging smartphone use trend, as more and more people use phone cameras. Daily mobile internet usage continues to grow year by year, on a global scale. Of all mobile traffic, online video now accounts for upwards of 50 percent.</p>\n<p>The prevalence of both video and smartphones have paved the way for newer social platforms centered around live streaming video, like Periscope, Meerkat, and now Blab.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-7873\"></span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://blab.im/\" target=\"_blank\">Blab.im</a> (which is still in beta) is quickly growing in popularity. As a platform that is truly social, interactive, informational, and fun, Blab is certainly worth getting acquainted with for its many potential uses as a tool for business and marketing.</p>\n<p>Since Blab is one of the newest of the live video trend, let&#8217;s take a closer look.</p>\n<h2>What Is Blab?</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://Blab.im\" target=\"_blank\">Blab.im</a> is a live video broadcasting platform for hosting, watching, and joining conversations.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_7891\" style=\"width: 793px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-7891\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-7891 size-full\" src=\"http://blog1.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/screen-shot-2016-04-04-at-4-35-45-pm.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2016-04-04 at 4.35.45 PM\" width=\"783\" height=\"522\" srcset=\"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/screen-shot-2016-04-04-at-4-35-45-pm.png 783w, https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/screen-shot-2016-04-04-at-4-35-45-pm-300x200.png 300w, https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/screen-shot-2016-04-04-at-4-35-45-pm-768x512.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 783px) 100vw, 783px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-7891\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">THis is a caption</p></div></p>\n<p>Image source: https://blab.im/about</p>\n<p>While many have likened it to &#8220;Periscope for groups,” you can also think of it as a cross between a talk show and a webinar. It can be used for either of those things as well as casual hang outs, debates, discussions, and workshops. There is nothing quite like it on the market, although it incorporates the best components of several different social media platforms.</p>\n<p>Anyone can host their own Blab. It’s available for anyone to watch and interact with. No professional equipment is necessary.</p>\n<p>Blab supports two to four “presenters&#8221; at a time, displayed in a grid, à la Brady Bunch. Meanwhile, other participants can watch the conversation live on video while adding to the discussion and posing questions via text chat. The host can even pull in audience members into the “hot seat” on the live video chat from time to time, if they so choose.</p>\n<p>After the chat wraps up, the conversation can be re-watched on Blab, and the hosts have the option to post the recording to Youtube or embed it on their own site.</p>\n<h2>Industry</h2>\n<p>Blab.im primarily seems to be used by solopreneurs and online thought leaders, discussing topics that range from sports to politics to social media trends.</p>\n<p>Blab is also ripe for online marketers and sales departments in just about any industry. It’s ideal for brands that want to give their customers a chance to interact in a personal way, visually demonstrate the value of their product or service, or establish their brand&#8217;s expertise and thought leadership. Granted, a direct sales pitch or advertisement won’t fly on this platform. But the interactive and visual nature of Blab opens doors to a number of benefits for businesses.</p>\n<h2>Why Blab Could Change Your Business</h2>\n<p>Blab can be used for a number of valuable business functions. It shortens the distance between you and your customer and opens up a new realm of in-the-moment experiences to create. From an online marketing standpoint, it’s a great platform for developing authentic and personalized connections with clients because it is live and unpolished. Showing, rather than just telling, and being able to answer customer concerns on the spot goes a long way in developing trust and loyalty.</p>\n<p>Here are some examples of a variety of ways Blab can be used for business:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Unveil new products with live demonstrations.</li>\n<li>Provide group coaching sessions.</li>\n<li>Conduct a Q&#38;A session or office hours.</li>\n<li>Demonstrate expertise by providing useful info for your audience.</li>\n<li>Demonstrate transparency by answering tough customer questions.</li>\n<li>Discuss strategy with your peers.</li>\n<li>Give a behind-the-scenes experience to your tribe.</li>\n<li>Network with your target audience by being a participant in other shows.</li>\n<li>Brainstorm ideas with your audience, almost like a focus group.</li>\n<li>Get feedback on changes you’ve implemented or ideas you’re considering.</li>\n<li>Record and re-use a Blab conversation as a podcast or blog post.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Learn More</h2>\n<p>Blab.im is still in beta, so the best way to get acquainted with it is to watch shows by folks who have proven success on the platform.

For example, you were interested in ICO (Initial Coin Offering) and Leo detected ICO (Internet Commissioner Office).</li><li>The &#8220;duplicated article&#8221; feedback <g class=\"gr_ gr_20 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace\" id=\"20\" data-gr-id=\"20\">allow</g> you to flag articles which are on topic but you have already read about via a different source</li><li>The &#8220;I&#8217;m not interested in&#8221; feedback allow you to flag class of articles you are not interested <g class=\"gr_ gr_19 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace\" id=\"19\" data-gr-id=\"19\">about</g>. For example, you might not be interested in market research type articles. If you can flag 10-20 articles as I am not interested in market research, Leo is going to learn and start prioritizing fewer market research articles.</li><li>Sometimes (<g class=\"gr_ gr_16 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling multiReplace\" id=\"16\" data-gr-id=\"16\">specially</g> for keyword alerts), you might get articles from sources you do not care about. The &#8216;mute domain&#8217; feedback allows you to train your Leo to mute articles from those domains.</li><li>Finally, sometimes, the reason is more complex. The &#8216;Something else&#8217; feedback offers you an easy way out.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<h2>Deduplication</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We also heard from a lot of users that duplicate articles are a big source of noise and echo in their feeds. If you are tired of seeing the same article or press release being pushed across multiple sources, Leo 0.5 near exact deduplication is here to help.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gts-feedly-image wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"webfeeds-frame-simple webfeeds-size-large\"><img src=\"http://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-06-02.10.19.png\"/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><figcaption>A sign at the bottom right shows the count of duplicates which are automatically removed</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Leo continuously monitors your feeds and when he detects duplicates, it automatically clean up your feeds so that you only get one copy of the article or press release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is particularly useful if you follow a lot of Google Keyword Alerts or if you follow source that cross post content.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Control and Transparency</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A very important aspect of the Leo promise is that it is a fun, non-black-box AI you fully control and can easily collaborate with.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gts-feedly-image wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"webfeeds-frame-simple webfeeds-size-large\"><img src=\"http://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-06-01.05.28.png\"/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><figcaption>Transparency via clear explanations</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Transparent because each time Leo makes a prioritization, he will explain why the article was prioritized and give you the opportunity to refine that prioritization.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gts-feedly-image wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"webfeeds-frame-simple webfeeds-size-large\"><img src=\"http://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-06-01.05.49.png\"/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><figcaption>Full control</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Control because you explicitly define all the priorities of your Leo and you can at anytime go in the Train Leo section and remove or refine a priority. No black box. No lag.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Goodbye Information Overload</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Leo 0.1 Alpha customers saw 40-70% noise reduction on their feeds. More targeted feeds mean that you can save time while reducing the risk of missing important articles, or being the last to know about an important risk or market opportunity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We look forward to seeing how your will be training your Leo!</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-gts-feedly-button webfeeds-actions leoAction\"><h2><div class=\"title\"></div><span

We like to call it the Content Renaissance.</p>\n<p>Whatever you call it, many of us have been talking about the same idea: Content is coming to us at an ever increasing rate.</p>\n<p>The result is that ideas, trends, and memes have become a swiftly moving current that will easily overwhelm us or leave us behind if we let it.</p>\n<h2>The Content Renaissance Is Creating an Explosion of Content</h2>\n<p>We live in an unprecedented age in which we are creating more content than ever before and in which we have more access to information and ideas than ever.</p>\n<p>Ninety percent of the world’s data has been generated in the last two years, according to one <a href=\"http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/05/130522085217.htm\" target=\"_blank\">study</a>. Google publishes 20 petabytes of information every day, according to <a href=\"https://www.promodo.com/blog/amazing-google-facts-you-most-probably-didnt-know/\" target=\"_blank\">Promodo</a> in 2013. To put it in perspective, there have been 5,000 petabytes of information created from the dawn of civilization to 2003. In 2014, WordPress reported that it was publishing 17 posts every second—or 1.5 million posts per day. In that year alone, 72 million websites were created.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-7630\"></span></p>\n<p>And the production of content is still growing. Ninety-two percent of marketers are creating more digital content now than they did two years ago, and 83 percent expect this number to continue to rise, according to <a href=\"http://www.komarketingassociates.com/industry-news/report-marketing-professionals-see-a-dramatic-rise-in-content-production-2939/\" target=\"_blank\">Accenture</a>.</p>\n<p>If this isn’t overwhelming enough, social networks are accelerating this flow of information still faster. According to <a href=\"https://www.domo.com/blog/2014/04/data-never-sleeps-2-0/\" target=\"_blank\">Domo</a>, every minute:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Facebook users share almost 2.5 million posts</li>\n<li>Twitter users tweet almost 300,000 times</li>\n<li>Instagrammers upload almost 220,000 photos</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This influx of content carries plenty of upside for individuals and publishers alike. It’s easier than ever to share your gospel. Creatives thrive in this new medium, and businesses are creating engaging new experiences.</p>\n<p>However as consumers of this content and as merchants of ideas, the firehose is overwhelming as it is satisfying.</p>\n<h2>Enter Trend Acceleration</h2>\n<p>The result of the Content Renaissance is that content has become the currency of change. Ideas are being exchanged, embraced, and evolved at an ever increasing rate.</p>\n<p>As a result, while trends used to come and go over the span of years, these days discussions are moving thought leadership at a cadence of months or weeks.</p>\n<p>This deeply impacts the way we do business and the way we operate in this world.</p>\n<p>For marketers, in particular, it means that the ability to engage consumers with fresh and relevant points of view is a swiftly moving window. The current of new ideas is so fast, that it is easier than ever to attach your brand to something considered more passé.</p>\n<p>For PR people, it means a bigger challenge in cutting through the noise with something sharply unique.</p>\n<p>For corporations, it means creating products that serve customers in a quickly changing competitive landscape. Small businesses have to move just as quickly with often times fewer resources.</p>\n<p>So how do you stay ahead of it?</p>\n<p>The key is to identify the right <strong>signals</strong> and then implement the right workflow to <strong>monitor</strong> those signals.</p>\n<p><strong>1.Recognize the need to monitor for yourself and your company, and dedicate resources to the task.</strong></p>\n<p>Monitoring is an art, science, and a process, and above all, it takes time and attention. Recognize that with your daily work or within your business and be deliberate about setting aside time for yourself or people resources within your business to do it well. Have you set aside some time for yourself to crunch through these trends? Do you have the right people on the job? Do you have the right tools in place?</p>\n<p><strong>2. Identify the right signals — create the right mix of places and people to follow.</strong></p>\n<p>Many algorithms today try to guess what is important to us by predicting future interests based on past behavior. Staying on the cusp, however, requires a proactive, but efficient, way of identifying what the right signals are. A signal is that place from which new ideas and new trends are broadcast.</p>\n<p>Identify the most important pieces of news or thinking on the new trend and use those to develop a <a href=\"https://blog.feedly.com/get-the-right-content-on-your-feedly/\">personalized content mix</a> based on:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Key influencers and thought leaders</strong> &#8211; Who are the main voices in the articles? Who are the main people they cite? Who are other thinkers in that realm?</li>\n<li><strong>Key producers in Twitter, YouTube, Facebook, and Reddit</strong> &#8211; Real-time channels can indicate the earliest rumblings of a trend. Find the right people in each of these social networks and add them to your list. <a href=\"http://storyful.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Storyful</a>, a company that specializes in newsgathering from social networks, recommends finding relevant content from each of these social channels to get a full picture.</li>\n<li><strong>Specific Geographies to keep a pulse on</strong> &#8211; Is your main industry magazines in New York? Is it a new irrigation system being tried in Venice? Is it human trafficking legislation in San Diego? Consider some local sources in your content mix.</li>\n<li><strong>Keywords</strong> &#8211; Are there buzzwords that show up within the trend you are monitoring? If you are following the Tea Party movement in America, should you be following any mentions of “Sarah Palin,” “immigration,” “gun ownership”?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here are some great feeds that other people have created to follow the latest trends in a given industry:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sarah Levine and the most important publications in <a href=\"http://feedly.com/sarahmakesmaps/maps\" target=\"_blank\">Maps</a>.</li>\n<li>Guy Kawasaki’s Collection of <a href=\"http://feedly.com/GuyKawasaki/Social%20Media%20Marketing\" target=\"_blank\">Social Media sources</a>.</li>\n<li>Rand Fishkin’s Collection on <a href=\"http://feedly.com/randfish/Inbound%20Marketing\" target=\"_blank\">Inbound Marketing</a>.</li>\n<li>Ann Handley’s Collection on <a href=\"http://feedly.com/MarketingProfs/Content%20Marketing\" target=\"_blank\">Content Marketing</a>.</li>\n<li>Hilah Johnson’s Collection on <a href=\"http://feedly.com/HilahCooking/Food%20YouTube%20Channels\" target=\"_blank\">Food YouTube Channels</a>.</li>\n<li>Annie Cushing’s Collection on <a href=\"http://feedly.com/annie/Analytics\" target=\"_blank\">Data Analytics</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>3. Centralize these signals into the fewest number of places that allow you to follow these people, publications, and trends most efficiently.</strong></p>\n<p>Much of today’s content is on different platforms and requires you to go to it. Flip this around and have this content come to you by creating the right workflow. Focusing in on the workflow will allow you to crunch through the onslaught of content quickly and methodically. We’re a bit biased, but naturally we recommend Feedly as a place for you to house all the blogs, publications, Google Alerts, YouTube feeds, Facebook feeds, and Twitter feeds you are monitoring.</p>\n<p>With Feedly, you can create a separate feed for each specific trend, vertical, product, or industry that you are monitoring. With <a href=\"https://feedly.com/i/pro/\">Feedly Pro</a>, you can even use <a href=\"https://blog.feedly.com/find-and-filter-the-best-content-on-the-web-with-power-search/\">Power Search</a> to search for specific terms within a feed, organized by media type or date.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Archive the data points.</strong></p>\n<p>Create a methodology for saving and organizing the precious content pieces you find online that speak to the topic you are following. Many people like to use Evernote or Pocket to save articles. We highly recommend using boards within Feedly to save and organize the great pieces of content you want to share with others or return to later.</p>\n<p><strong>5. More eyes, better vision: Crowdsource monitoring</strong></p>\n<p>The more people who are collaborating together, the better a pulse you will have on trends and the richer your conversations will be around them. Create an internal system through which all employees can contribute important content on new trends and key teams can ingest this information in an organized fashion.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Broadcast your interest and join the conversation</strong></p>\n<p>The more you can show your interest in a particular conversation the easier it will be to have conversations with the right influencers. Consider taking the content you are monitoring and broadcasting your interest in the vertical via social channels.</p>\n<p>What are ways that you and your company have found effective in finding the right signals or organizing them into workflows that are easy to follow?</p>\n                </div>\n            \n\n           ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 10 Mar 2016 15:00:40 +0000","feedId":887,"bgimg":"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/trend-acceleration.jpeg","linkMd5":"f9df96dba603d00529d8732061aedb98","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn3@2020_4/2020/08/16/13-38-37-038_ffb251383d6955ae.webp","destWidth":3300,"destHeight":2049,"author":"feedly","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/trend-acceleration.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn81@2020_3/2020/08/16/13-38-53-719_ffb251383d6955ae.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 21:38:35","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 21:38:35","title":"Design Review: The New Organize Experience","link":"https://blog.feedly.com/?p=9391","description":"\n              \n                <div>\n                  <div class=\"webfeeds-header\">\n                      <img class=\"webfeeds-header__illustration webfeedsFeaturedVisual\" src=\"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/organize-v0@2x.png\" width=\"816\" height=\"640\" />                                        <div class=\"webfeeds-header__title\"><!-- injected by client --></div>\n                                      </div>\n                  <p><a class=\"a2a_button_facebook\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.feedly.com%2Forganize%2F&#38;linkname=Design%20Review%3A%20The%20New%20Organize%20Experience\" title=\"Facebook\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_twitter\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.feedly.com%2Forganize%2F&#38;linkname=Design%20Review%3A%20The%20New%20Organize%20Experience\" title=\"Twitter\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_linkedin\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.feedly.com%2Forganize%2F&#38;linkname=Design%20Review%3A%20The%20New%20Organize%20Experience\" title=\"LinkedIn\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_buffer\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/buffer?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.feedly.com%2Forganize%2F&#38;linkname=Design%20Review%3A%20The%20New%20Organize%20Experience\" title=\"Buffer\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"></a></p><p><strong>Update:</strong> We launched the new organize experience! <a href=\"https://blog.feedly.com/organize-sources/\">Read the announcement here</a>.</p>\n<p>At Feedly we&#8217;re focused on simplifying how you consume information every day. We help you find and connect to all the sources you need. The next step is giving you a simple, effective way to organize your sources by topic, project, industry, client, or passion.</p>\n<p>Being able to re-organize these sources as your needs evolve is a critical part of controlling the signal-to-noise ratio in your Feedly. One of our goals for 2017 is to make re-organizing sources easier, faster, and more data-driven.</p>\n<p>We started this journey by reaching out to the community and listening to your feedback. <strong>Thank you</strong> to the 27,000+ people who participated in the Organize survey by telling us how we could improve the experience. Here are some of the most popular requests from the survey:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Visibility into broken sources and publishing frequency</li>\n<li>Ability to sort and filter feeds</li>\n<li>Show personal reading statistics</li>\n<li>Editing single sources and bulk operations to move or unfollow sources</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>00 — Design Direction</h2>\n<p>Based on the survey data, we decided to center the new organize experience on 3 features:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Show a bird’s-eye view of your sources using filters for <strong>source activity</strong> (active, inactive, or unreachable) in a specific feed or by searching for a source by name</li>\n<li>Surface <strong>metadata</strong> about how useful each source has been to you recently. In the first version, we’re focusing on the number of articles per month and how many of those you have read</li>\n<li>Make it <strong>easy to act</strong> on this metadata: select multiple sources and move or unfollow them</li>\n</ol>\n<figure class=\"webfeeds-frame-browser webfeeds-size-large\"><img src=\"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/screenshot-1-1.jpg\" /></figure>\n<h2>01 — Filter sources</h2>\n<p>During our research, we found that on average people follow about 75 sources organized into 10 feeds. At the same time, some users have 20,000 sources and more than 200 feeds.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-9440 size-full\" src=\"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/chart-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1104\" height=\"680\" srcset=\"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/chart-2.png 1104w, https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/chart-2-300x185.png 300w, https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/chart-2-768x473.png 768w, https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/chart-2-1024x631.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1104px) 100vw, 1104px\" /><br />\nOne of our challenges was finding a way to enable you to manage a large number of sources as easily as just a few. We decided on an table-like interface with a list of all your sources along with some reading statistics. This list, combined with a powerful filter, should solve two big needs expressed in your survey responses: 1) to find sources that are either unreachable or too noisy, and 2) to see which of your feeds the source belongs to.</p>\n<p>We also created some shortcuts for the most-used operations like finding unreachable or inactive sources.</p>\n<figure class=\"webfeeds-frame-simple webfeeds-size-large\"><img src=\"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/screenshot-2-2.jpg\" /><figcaption>In the new user interface, you can filter sources by activity and by the feeds they belong to.</figcaption></figure>\n<h2>02 — Reading Statistics and Source Status</h2>\n<p>The ultimate goal of the new organize UI is to help you optimize your signal-to-noise ratio. By reviewing your personal reading statistics, you can make informed decisions about the sources you follow. You will see 2 metrics to keep things simple: how often sources are updated, and how many of those updates you read.</p>\n<figure class=\"webfeeds-frame-simple webfeeds-size-large\"><img src=\"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/screenshot-3.jpg\" /></figure>\n<p>We believe these metrics are correlated. If the feed is getting hundreds of new articles and you’re reading just a few of them, this is a good indication of where the “noise” is coming from.</p>\n<h2>03 — Batch Operations</h2>\n<p>Now that you know where most of your content is coming from and how you consume it, the next step is to take action. Our gut feeling (validated by the survey data) is that the most important actions are re-organizing your sources and feeds and unfollowing inactive or unreachable sources.</p>\n<p>In the new Organize experience, it’s easy to move multiple sources at once. You can also group sources into multiple feeds.

Over the past few weeks we have rethought the way you can clean up and reorganize your feedly. I worked with the feedly team to design two different concepts and would love to hear your feedback to help us build the best organized experience possible!</p>\n<p>In a recent survey with 5,000 participants, many of you showed us that you like to reorganize your feedly for two main reasons:</p>\n<p><strong>Spring cleaning<br />\n</strong>Every once in a while you need to clean up your feedly to make sure you only follow the feeds that interest you. This involves removing inactive feeds (the ones that have not published in months), removing the feeds you don’t read anymore, and promoting articles to “must-read” publications, so you don’t miss a story.</p>\n<p><strong>Reorganization<br />\n</strong>There are other times when you feel like reorganizing parts or all of your feedly. Maybe you have new interests or you want to split a topic into a few more specific topics, such as splitting your Marketing Collection into SEO and Digital Marketing Collections. All of this involves renaming Collections, moving them around and moving feeds from one Collection to another.</p>\n<p>After a few weeks of design work with these two use cases in mind, we came up with two design directions:</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-7439\"></span></p>\n<h2>Concept 1: Organize At a Glance</h2>\n<p>The main idea behind this concept is that everything is available in one page with just the crucial information you need to optimize your feedly. Your collections are listed on the right and the selected Collection’s feeds appear at the center of the page. This enables you to move from Collection to Collection without switching context.</p>\n<p>You can try out this concept on InVision: https://invis.io/D567GADVZ</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7455\" src=\"https://blog1.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/selected-design.png\" alt=\"Selected-Design\" width=\"1154\" height=\"641\" srcset=\"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/selected-design.png 1440w, https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/selected-design-300x167.png 300w, https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/selected-design-768x427.png 768w, https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/selected-design-1024x569.png 1024w, https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/selected-design-1200x667.png 1200w, https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/selected-design-800x444.png 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1154px) 100vw, 1154px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>View important information at a glance<br />\n</strong>With this first concept we are showing you the essential information you need when you need it, no less, no more. For instance, when looking at a Collection you will see the feeds that are Must Read and those which are inactive. It’s just enough information for you to take action with no clutter.</p>\n<p>Because your Collections are listed on the right side, you can easily navigate from one to the other rapidly.</p>\n<p><strong>Take the main actions in one click<br />\n</strong>Most actions are one click away or one drag away. Hit the cross or the star icon to remove a feed from a Collection or mark a feed as must read, respectively (see below for examples). Use drag and drop gestures to move a feed to the Collection it should belong to and re-order your Collections.</p>\n<p>_<br />\n<em>Making a feed must read</em></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-baskervillepostthumbnail wp-image-7459\" src=\"https://blog1.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/minimal-mustread.png?w=904\" alt=\"minimal-mustread\" width=\"904\" height=\"392\" srcset=\"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/minimal-mustread.png 904w, https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/minimal-mustread-300x130.png 300w, https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/minimal-mustread-768x333.png 768w, https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/minimal-mustread-800x347.png 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 904px) 100vw, 904px\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">_<br />\n<em>Moving a feeds to a different Collection</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-baskervillepostthumbnail wp-image-7458\" src=\"https://blog1.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/minimal-movefeed.png?w=904\" alt=\"minimal-movefeed\" width=\"904\" height=\"392\" srcset=\"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/minimal-movefeed.png 904w, https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/minimal-movefeed-300x130.png 300w, https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/minimal-movefeed-768x333.png 768w, https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/minimal-movefeed-800x347.png 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 904px) 100vw, 904px\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">_<br />\n<em>Reordering a Collection</em></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7457\" src=\"https://blog1.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/minimal-movecollection.png\" alt=\"minimal-movecollection\" width=\"904\" height=\"392\" srcset=\"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/minimal-movecollection.png 904w, https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/minimal-movecollection-300x130.png 300w, https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/minimal-movecollection-768x333.png 768w, https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/minimal-movecollection-800x347.png 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 904px) 100vw, 904px\" /></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h2>Concept 2: Organize with Deep Site Information</h2>\n<p>This second concept takes advantage of data tables and the feedly slider.

By default, most teams rely on ad hoc email chains and chat to share links. These options lack context and add a lot of unwanted noise, chaos, and stress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, Feedly is excited to launch <strong>Team Newsletters</strong>. It&#8217;s the latest addition to <a href=\"https://feedly.com/i/landing/team?utm_source=blog&#38;utm_medium=launch&#38;utm_campaign=team-newsletter\">our intelligence tools for teams</a>.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"webfeeds-frame-simple webfeeds-size-large webfeeds-youtube\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nXQ3veDWpNI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n</div>\n\n\n<p>Team newsletters are quickly becoming one of the most popular features of Feedly Teams. It is a simple yet powerful way to share important industry trends and insights with the rest of your team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Newsletters are easy to set up and provide a quick summary of relevant articles saved by your team. And best of all, Feedly will send your newsletters to any email address, even if the person isn&#8217;t part of your Feedly Teams account.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Turn Boards Into Newsletters</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Creating a team newsletter is very easy: simply save the articles you would like to include in your newsletter to a <a href=\"https://blog.feedly.com/boards/\">Team Board</a> and activate the newsletter feature on that board.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are already subscribed to <a href=\"https://feedly.com/i/landing/team?utm_source=blog&#38;utm_medium=launch&#38;utm_campaign=team-newsletter\">Feedly Teams</a>, you can activate your newsletter in just a few clicks. Open one of your Team Boards and click on the email icon. Flip the switch to ON, and select your options. If you are new to Feedly Teams, follow the link above to&#160;try it free with your team for 30 days.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image webfeeds-frame-simple webfeeds-size-large\"><img src=\"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/NL-activatenewsletter-083017.gif\" alt=\"\"/><figcaption>Click on the email envelope icon on any of your Team Boards or Feeds to activate the newsletter feature.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Feedly will automatically convert newly saved articles into a <a href=\"https://blog.feedly.com/newsletter-templates/\">formatted newsletter</a> and deliver it on the schedule you choose to your teammates as well as people outside of your team.

Inspired by their success, we <a href=\"https://blog.feedly.com/newsletter-examples/\">created&#160;4 examples of effective team newsletters</a> based on&#160;customers in finance, information security, and sales,&#160;as well as our awesome design team at Feedly.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Notes and Highlights Add Valuable Context</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You can use the&#160;<a href=\"https://blog.feedly.com/boards/#notes-highlights\">notes and highlights</a>&#160;features to enrich newsletters with insights&#160;and article summaries, ask questions to spark discussion, and call your teammates&#8217; attention to important news events.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image webfeeds-frame-simple webfeeds-size-large\"><img src=\"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/newsletter-with-annotations.jpg\" alt=\"\"/><figcaption>When you open a Team Newsletter in your inbox, you will see the&#160;<a href=\"https://blog.feedly.com/boards/#notes-highlights\">notes and highlights</a> your teammates have added to articles.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s say each person on your sales team is following a set&#160;of boards related to their target accounts. Every morning they will receive a beautiful email digest with all the new articles saved to each of the boards they follow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These valuable nuggets of context make it easy to scan for relevant insights to use on sales calls or strategy sessions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On busier days, maybe all you have time for is a 5-minute overview of what has happened related to the topics in your Team Boards. Newsletters give you just that—a quick and easy way to keep up with the latest news.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you can always click on an item in the email to read the full article.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Flexible Scheduling and Display Options</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the settings for each newsletter, you can change the days and times you want your newsletters to land in your inbox.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image webfeeds-frame-simple webfeeds-size-large\"><img src=\"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/NL-schedulesettings-083017.png\" alt=\"\"/><figcaption>Customize each newsletter to send on your desired schedule. Choose the template with or without images.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are subscribed to two or more newsletters scheduled for the same time, Feedly will bundle them into a single email. In our team at Feedly, some of our Team Newsletters send daily, while others are less frequent. We have some newsletters scheduled for the same time, so they are combined into one email.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check out <a href=\"https://blog.feedly.com/newsletter-templates/\">these sample templates</a> to see examples of both display options: Text-only or with a featured image. The text-only option makes the email shorter, especially if your newsletter contains more than a few articles.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Include People Outside Your Feedly Team</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Easily add people outside your Feedly Team account to a newsletter too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is popular with customers who need to send relevant updates to a wider audience such as your sales team or senior executives.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image webfeeds-frame-simple webfeeds-size-large\"><img src=\"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/NL-external-recipients-newsletter-102017.png\" alt=\"\"/><figcaption>Share your team newsletters with colleagues outside your Feedly Team account.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Go to your Board Settings and enter the distribution list or individual email addresses in the box labeled “external recipients.” They will receive the newsletter on the same schedule.</p>\n\n\n\n<section class=\"webfeeds-pro-tips\">If you want to send your newsletter to multiple external email addresses, be sure to use a comma to separate each email.</section>\n\n\n\n<p>External recipients—anyone not part of your Feedly Team—will be directed to the article on the source website, rather than going to the article in Feedly.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Beautiful on Any Email Client</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We have optimized Team Newsletters to be easy to read on any device and email client.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gts-feedly-image wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"webfeeds-frame-simple webfeeds-size-small\"><img src=\"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/NL-mobilegif-091117.gif\"/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Save Articles From Anywhere</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Using Feedly&#8217;s &#8220;<a href=\"https://feedly.com/i/support/extensions\">Save to Board</a>&#8221; browser extension, you can save articles to your boards while reading on the original source website.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image webfeeds-frame-simple webfeeds-size-large\"><img src=\"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/NL-browser-extension-chrome-102017.png\" alt=\"\"/><figcaption>Articles you save using the extension will appear in your newsletter the same as articles saved within Feedly.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ready to get started?</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-gts-feedly-button webfeeds-actions\"><h2><div class=\"title\"></div><span class=\"sub\"></span></h2><p><a href=\"https://feedly.com/i/landing/team?utm_source=blog&#38;utm_medium=launch&#38;utm_campaign=team-newsletter\" class=\"button accent\">TRY TEAM NEWSLETTERS FOR FREE</a></p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>FAQ</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Q: Which template should I choose?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two templates available: with or without images. You can change this setting anytime. <a href=\"https://blog.feedly.com/newsletter-templates/\">Read more about templates</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Q: How do I adjust the frequency of emails?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Set a different sending schedule for each newsletter, or combine newsletters by having two or more send at the same time. Click the email envelope icon on a Team Board or Team Feed to adjust the sending days and time. For example, one board&#8217;s newsletter could send daily while all others send 2 or 3 times&#160;a week.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Q: What time will my newsletters&#160;arrive?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Set each board to send an email roundup at the time that&#8217;s best for your team. Select the hour of the day you want to trigger the email in each board&#8217;s settings page.

The team is listening and crunching through all that feedback and adapting Leo to improve UI/UX as well as the relevance of the underlying machine learning models.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is a summary of the changes we&#8217;re pushing out today as part of Leo  0.6 Beta.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Smart Topics</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the feedback we collected was that the difference between mentions and topics was not clear. So in 0.6, we merged these two concepts into a single one we call Smart T<g class=\"gr_ gr_56 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace\" id=\"56\" data-gr-id=\"56\">opics</g>. Just search what you want to prioritize and Leo will start analyzing the content of your feeds and prioritize the articles which are a match.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gts-feedly-image wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"webfeeds-frame-simple webfeeds-size-large\"><img src=\"http://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-19-18.17.17.png\"/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><figcaption>Search for companies, products, people and topics in a unified experience</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Level of Aboutness</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes you are interested in a company, product, or topic and you want to see every article mentioning that topic. Sometimes, for more popular topics, you are only interested in reading an article if the article is truly about that topic or company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Leo 0.6 exposes a &#8220;level of aboutness&#8221; knob that gives you more control over the model so that you can cut out low salience matches.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gts-feedly-image wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"webfeeds-frame-simple webfeeds-size-large\"><img src=\"http://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-19-18.34.26.png\"/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><figcaption>Tune the aboutness parameter of each layer</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if you are interested in NLP or BERT, you can train Leo to only prioritize research articles that are prominently about those topics (as opposed to articles which only briefly touch on those topics).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a particularly powerful feature when combined with Google News Keyword alerts.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Global Priorities</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Some Leo 0.5 beta customers mentioned that it was critical for them to be able to define priorities that span across multiple feeds. For example, you might be doing research about Stablecoin and want to prioritize that topic across both your Tech feed, your Business feed, or all your personal or team feeds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Leo 0.6, the priority designer allows you to pick &#8220;All Team Feeds&#8221; or &#8220;All Personal Feeds&#8221; as the scope of the priority.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gts-feedly-image wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"webfeeds-frame-simple webfeeds-size-large\"><img src=\"http://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-19-18.48.26.png\"/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><figcaption>Create a priority that spans across all your team feeds</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This change reduces the total number of priorities you need to create and manage when researching topic and trends across multiple of your feeds.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Quick Access</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Some users mentioned that they would like to be able to navigate their content by priority. If you are interested in a specific topic like Docker, it makes sense to be able to quickly see if there are new Docker related articles in your Feedly and easily access those articles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Leo 0.6, we added a new Priorities section to the left navigation bar that surfaces all your priorities and gives you quick access to all the article Leo has flagged as important.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gts-feedly-image wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"webfeeds-frame-simple webfeeds-size-large\"><img src=\"http://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-19-18.19.24.png\"/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><figcaption>Quick Access to all the NLP article prioritized by Leo</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We added two settings in <a href=\"https://feedly.com/i/account/leo\">the Leo settings</a> to let you personalize this feature. You can decide if you want to see priorities in your left navigation. If you want to see all the priorities or all the global ones (default). If you want to see all the priorities or only the ones which <g class=\"gr_ gr_6 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace\" id=\"6\" data-gr-id=\"6\">hav</g> unread articles.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Inlined Entities</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Your interests and priorities are continuously evolving. Often, you discover a new company, product, or topic while reading an article and you want to be able to teach Leo about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Leo 0.6, the most prominent topics mentioned in an article are highlighted so that you can quickly prioritize them (or mute them)</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gts-feedly-image wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"webfeeds-frame-simple webfeeds-size-large\"><img src=\"http://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-19-19.03.35.png\"/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><figcaption>Inlined Entities allow for quick prioritization of new topics</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As part of Leo&#8217;s Cyber Security skill, you will also see highlights of CVE entities. More to come soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like for the Quick Access feature, there is a Leo setting that allow you to turn off Inlined Entities if that is your preference.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Like Board Improvements</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The ML team is spending time understanding how you are engaging with your priority feeds (which articles are saved to a board, which articles are being Less Like This&#8217;ed) and tuning the underlying ML models to improve accuracy. You should expect to see the quality of your priority feeds improve over the next 8 weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Power Search</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of Feedly Pro and Feedly Teams customer rely on power search to find specific articles in their feeds and boards. In Leo 0.6, we are expanding power search and let you search with your priority feeds.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gts-feedly-image wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"webfeeds-frame-simple webfeeds-size-large\"><img src=\"http://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-19-18.22.06.png\"/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><figcaption>Search for BERT within the NLP priority</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For teams using Leo to discover and track trends, opportunities, and trends across industries, the combination of Leo priorities and Power search is a powerful way to quick find the most crucial information</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Thank you!</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We want to thank all the beta customers who have been working very closely with us over the last few weeks (and sometimes months). We are very grateful for your time and precious feedback. This open collaboration is not only powerful and efficient but it is also very fun. We look forward to the next 3 months!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Edwin, Remi, and Victoria</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Love reading? Love the Web?

Opinion and insight can emerge from anywhere. Whether you’re new to Feedly or not, you want good, trusted publishers to teach you more about a certain topic, market or industry.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Feedly already digests and presents updates from the sources you value. But to really stay ahead of the curve, it pays to search beyond the publishers you already follow – to the blogs, articles, reports, and debates that are turning heads, but almost buried among the noise online.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s why we’ve given Feedly the ability to look further with <strong>Power Search across the web</strong>. It drills down into the specific information you want to find <em>beyond</em> your existing feeds and sources.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this way, you can learn something new, discover new sources for future reference and easily share reputable insights with your colleagues and social network. It intersects the exact content you’re looking for with super-specific topics and publications.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-gts-feedly-button webfeeds-actions\"><h2><div class=\"title\"></div><span class=\"sub\"></span></h2><p><a href=\"https://feedly.com/i/pro/search\" class=\"button accent\">GET POWER SEARCH</a></p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s what Power Search across the Web does, and how to use it.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Introducing Power Search across the web</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Search is a relevance game. It’s easy to lose time in the wormhole of search engines. Meanwhile, the low hit rate of typical news aggregators and alert features can leave you pulling hairs out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Feedly gets around this with a carefully vetted database of more than 40 million trusted web sources. Collectively, they publish 110 million articles, journals, and videos. on a daily basis.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that’s still a crazy amount of info and analysis. So we help you refine this down with buckets<strong> </strong>– categories of publications that make a search super granular.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can think of each bucket as a list of trusted publications that focus on a specific industry, function or topic. They tell the search exactly<em> </em>what to filter. You get hyper-relevant content that can be saved to a Feedly board and shared with your team or out into the wider world. Six popular buckets are surfaced automatically yet other, more narrow buckets can be chosen &#8211; we’ll show you how to do this later in our guide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Discover what trade publications are saying about a company. Track topics on strategy sources. Bring up the conversation around a product in business magazines. The knowledge is yours to shape and tinker with.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Run-through</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, let’s imagine you’re part of the Innovation Hub at Aéroports de Paris. You’re looking for ground-breaking stories and reports about the airline industry.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, click on the search icon to open Power Search, select the new Across the web tab, and search for the airlines topic.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gts-feedly-image wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"webfeeds-frame-simple\"><img src=\"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/https___feedly_com_i_powerSearch_beyond.png\"/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><figcaption>Go to Power Search across the Web and search for airlines</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You get instant access to highly relevant articles from expert and trusted sources.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gts-feedly-image wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"webfeeds-frame-simple\"><img src=\"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-01-at-11.13.46-PM.png\"/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><figcaption>Search across the web for the topic airlines</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also search for companies, people, products, or other keywords you are interested in.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Narrow to specific publications</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The initial search is performed against a set of default buckets: strategy magazines, trade publications, business magazines, and tech blogs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you can narrow your search to a specific slice of the web. Click on +PUBLICATIONS and lookup energy for example.

For instance, any mention of COVID-19…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Exclude feature allows you to filter out specific topics or keywords from the search results. Click on Exclude &#62; +Topic and enter COVID-19.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gts-feedly-image wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"webfeeds-frame-simple\"><img src=\"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Exclude-COVID.png\"/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><figcaption>Use the exclude feature to filter out the noise</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Advanced mode</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are a power user, you can use the Title Only knob to let Feedly know if you want to search only in the title of articles or the entire content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The where on the web feature also includes a funnel button gives you more control over which publications should be included in the buckets. Pick leading publications if you are searching for a popular term and pick all publications if you are searching for a niche topic and you want your search to be as broad as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Make your Feedly better&#160;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you’ve discovered a great new article, you can click on the source name and see the other articles that the source has published.

Their 200-person global team helps news organizations and brands stay on top of current events as they unfurl.</p>\n<p>“We discover and verify the content from social media using our own technology and open source technology [editor’s note: including Feedly!], monitoring the social web in real time,” explained Derek Bowler, Storyful senior journalist and special projects lead, who also helps lead the company’s internal workflows, processes, and tools.</p>\n<p>Storyful’s ability to work together across time zones and continents is central to the value that they create. They have offices in Ireland, Hong Kong, Australia, and New York. “Collaboration is at the core of Storyful,” said Bowler.</p>\n<h2>All in one place</h2>\n<p>Storyful creates a feed in Feedly for every thread they monitor, including geopolitics, cat videos, and anything else that&#8217;s important to their customers. Feedly helps Storyful&#8217;s editors follow multiple sources on the same topic without having to jump around to different sources. And when they see an influx of new articles in a feed, it often means that a new story might be breaking.</p>\n<h2>Create a diverse mix of sources with your feeds</h2>\n<p>When Storyful identifies a topic to monitor, they hand pick sources that include as many known YouTube accounts from that particular location, Facebook feeds from active posters, <a href=\"https://feedly.com/i/discover/twitterFeeds\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Twitter accounts</a>, and any relevant sub-reddits. They often include multiple content streams from each of these channels in a single feed in Feedly.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-7742\"></span></p>\n<p>“That’s a one-stop shop because a lot of things we see happening in social media are encompassed in those channels,” says Bowler. “We knew a year ago that if we were monitoring those four major social platforms effectively, we were not able to monitor the topic effectively. The best thing about Feedly is that it allows you to bring it all to one place.”</p>\n<h2>Create an archive</h2>\n<p>One way Storyful uses Feedly is a bit unconventional: They use it as a YouTube archive that is easy for them to search. They have over a thousand YouTube channels to monitor. By connecting the YouTube feed to their Feedly, it becomes easy for them to know what is breaking, but also use search terms to find a specific video.</p>\n<h2>Connect Feedly with other open source tools</h2>\n<p>“There are a lot of open source tools that you can combine with Feedly to create a really powerful discovery tool for discovery desks to minimize their workflow,” Bowler says. “I no longer see Feedly as an RSS reader.”</p>\n<p>In particular, Storyful likes to use:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://fbrss.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">FB-RSS</a> &#8211; This tool creates feeds from Facebook pages.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://ifttt.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">IFTTT</a> + <a href=\"https://slack.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Slack</a> &#8211; Storyful relies on Slack for team communication. Using IFTTT, new Google Alert articles are automatically pushed to Slack via Feedly.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What do you use to monitor everyday news?</h2>\n<p>Are their tools, tips, or tricks that you or your organization use to be the first to know something?

It’s a chessboard on which attackers and defenders are constantly looking for checkmate.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hackers launch <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.varonis.com/blog/cybersecurity-statistics/\" target=\"_blank\">a new ransomware attack every 14 seconds</a>. They’re increasingly more capable and sophisticated. Learning how they plan attacks, what techniques they use, and who they’re targeting, can make you so much better prepared. You’ll save the cost and headache of a cyber assault too. This is especially important considering that the cost of ransomware attacks in the U.S. alone surpassed $7.5 billion in 2019.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But investigating malware threats is tedious. Hundreds of new articles and tweets need to be reviewed and triaged every day. Finding critical threats in that sea of information is time-consuming and overwhelming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We want to help you streamline your tactical and operational open-source intelligence, so that you can better protect your environment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s why we’ve taught Leo, your <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://blog.feedly.com/leo/\" target=\"_blank\">AI research assistant</a>, to recognize malware threats. You can ask him to read your security feeds and prioritize what’s relevant to you, your sector, and your environment.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-gts-feedly-button webfeeds-actions\"><h2><div class=\"title\"></div><span class=\"sub\"></span></h2><p><a href=\"https://feedly.typeform.com/to/zTSWjL\" class=\"button accent\">try feedly for cybersecurity</a></p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s imagine that you work in a threat intelligence team and are responsible for researching and analyzing the threat landscape. You’re particularly interested in evolving malware threats (including ransomware and malvertisement).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Cut through the noise</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You can train Leo to read your Security News feed and prioritize articles related to malware.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gts-feedly-image wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"webfeeds-frame-simple\"><img src=\"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Malware-1.png\"/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><figcaption>Leo prioritizes malware articles in your Security News feed</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Leo continuously reads the thousands of articles published in those feeds. It’s an efficient way to cut through the noise and keep up with the evolving malware landscape without the overwhelm.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>You’re in control</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Leo has been trained to understand broad topics like malware, as well as hundreds of specific malware types like malvertisement, ransomware, adware, bots, rootkits, spyware, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Asking Leo to prioritize malware in your Security News feed is as simple as creating a new Topic priority and selecting ‘malware’ as the topic.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gts-feedly-image wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"webfeeds-frame-simple\"><img src=\"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Malware-2.png\"/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><figcaption>Ask Leo to prioritize malware threats in your Security News feed</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You can <a href=\"https://blog.feedly.com/leo-and-topics/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">combine topics with +AND and +OR</a> and create even more targeted priorities for Leo. For example, use +AND to focus on malware related to Android or top companies in your sector.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gts-feedly-image wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"webfeeds-frame-simple\"><img src=\"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Malware-3.png\"/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><figcaption>Refine the priority to malware and Android</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also ask Leo to look for a specific type of malware like malvertisement or ransomware.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gts-feedly-image wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"webfeeds-frame-simple\"><img src=\"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Malware-4.png\"/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><figcaption>Prioritize ransomware threats</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Continuously learning and getting smarter</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Leo is smart.

The syntax of those mute filters have changed to the v2 syntax to allow more efficient processing on the back end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the v1 mute filters using advanced queries can not be migrated to v2 will remain active as legacy filters until user delete them.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Are there limits to the number of Leo mute filters a user or team can create?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the benefit of the Leo mute filters is that they can be processed more efficiently by our back-end. As a result, we are increasing the limit of Leo mute filters for Business users from 100 total to 100 per feed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Can non-Teams user access Leo?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We will be offering Leo to non-business users later this year via a Feedly Pro+ priced at $12/month.  You can request<strong> <a href=\"https://feedly.typeform.com/to/DW2vIZ?feature=leo-mute-filters\">early access to Pro+</a></strong> here. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Can a mute filter target a specific source?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>No. Mute filters can target a list of sources (what we call a feed) or all your feeds. </p>\n                </div>\n            \n\n

That kind of personalisation has become a goal not just for e-commerce companies, but for any organization running a digital business: users are constantly distracted, and when their attention is caught, they do not want to spend time figuring out what they most want.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Not every business is Amazon, though, so we are seeing a crop of startups emerging that are working on ways to help the rest of the digital world be just as optimised and personalised as Amazon. Now one of them, an Israeli startup called&#160;<a href=\"http://dynamicyield.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dynamic Yield</a>, has raised more money as it continues to expand its business, both to more platforms and to more geographies.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">The startup’s Series D has now closed off at $38 million, with the inclusion of a $5 million strategic investment from Naver, Korea’s “Google” (it’s the country’s top search portal) that is also behind messaging apps Line and Snow. The plan is for Naver to help bring&#160;<a href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/dynamic-yield\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-entity=\"dynamic-yield\" data-type=\"organization\">Dynamic Yield&#160;</a>to Korea and Japan, by incorporating its tech into its own services and those of others that work with Naver.</p>\n<p>-Olivier</p>\n                </div>\n            \n\n           ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 07 Nov 2018 02:08:56 +0000","feedId":887,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"016387821b0fcef0dd42ebfeb71652c5","metaImg":"","author":"Oliv","enclosureType":"audio/mpeg","enclosureUrl":"http://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/8890028e0401572003150d3b8dce43e3a63b0299.mp3"},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 21:38:35","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 21:38:35","title":"The Next Generation Feedly Mobile Has Arrived","link":"https://blog.feedly.com/?p=11082","description":"\n              \n                <div>\n                  <div class=\"webfeeds-header\">\n                      <img class=\"webfeeds-header__illustration webfeedsFeaturedVisual\" src=\"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/promo-1@2x.png\" width=\"5000\" height=\"4000\" />                                        <div class=\"webfeeds-header__title\"><!-- injected by client --></div>\n                                      </div>\n                  <p><a class=\"a2a_button_facebook\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.feedly.com%2Fnext-gen-mobile%2F&#38;linkname=The%20Next%20Generation%20Feedly%20Mobile%20Has%20Arrived\" title=\"Facebook\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_twitter\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.feedly.com%2Fnext-gen-mobile%2F&#38;linkname=The%20Next%20Generation%20Feedly%20Mobile%20Has%20Arrived\" title=\"Twitter\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_linkedin\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.feedly.com%2Fnext-gen-mobile%2F&#38;linkname=The%20Next%20Generation%20Feedly%20Mobile%20Has%20Arrived\" title=\"LinkedIn\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_buffer\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/buffer?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.feedly.com%2Fnext-gen-mobile%2F&#38;linkname=The%20Next%20Generation%20Feedly%20Mobile%20Has%20Arrived\" title=\"Buffer\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"></a></p><p>Six months ago, we launched <a href=\"https://blog.feedly.com/introducing-the-mobileai-lab/\">the Feedly Lab</a> and invited 4,000 Feedly users to participate in the design and testing of the next generation of the Feedly mobile application. Today, we are excited to launch the result of that work. You can download the new app for free on the App Store and Google Play.</p>\n<section class=\"webfeeds-actions\">\n<div class=\"webfeeds-group-buttons\"><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/feedly-your-work-newsfeed/id396069556?mt=8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://s3.feedly.com/production/head/images/apps/apple-store-badge@2x.png\" /></a><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.devhd.feedly\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://s3.feedly.com/production/head/images/apps/google-play-badge@2x.png\" /></a></div>\n</section>\n<p>Here is a quick tour of the new design.</p>\n<h2>Faster and more intuitive design</h2>\n<p>We love the Web because it is an open and distributed network that offers everyone the freedom and control to publish and follow what matters to them. The essence of this new design is to give you even more control over the information you follow and consume in your Feedly and make that experience more productive.</p>\n<figure class=\"webfeeds-frame-simple webfeeds-size-large\"><img src=\"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/new-design.gif\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Both on iOS and Android, we adopted more modern UI practices that make the experience feel lighter and easier to read. We also added more layout and density options so that user can pick the reading experience that best fits their preferences.</p>\n<h2>Powerful mark as read and save gestures</h2>\n<p>We learned from the Lab that marking as read and saving for later are key parts of our users’ workflows so we added some gestures to make those actions easier and faster to perform.</p>\n<figure class=\"webfeeds-frame-simple webfeeds-size-large\"><img src=\"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/gestures.gif\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<p>You can swipe left or right to trigger mark as read and save actions. You can long press to trigger a contextual menu which offers you even more actions and shortcuts.</p>\n<figure class=\"webfeeds-frame-simple webfeeds-size-large\"><img src=\"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screenshot-2018-12-01-14.43.09.png\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<p>In the global settings, you will also find an option to automatically mark stories as read as you scroll through your feeds.</p>\n<h2>Night Mode</h2>\n<p>Some of you really love to read Feedly at night, or you prefer to read in night mode all day. In the new Feedly app, we polished <a href=\"https://blog.feedly.com/experiment-05-night-mode/\">Night Mode</a> so that you can easily read in low-light environments.</p>\n<figure class=\"webfeeds-frame-simple webfeeds-size-large\"><img src=\"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screenshot-2018-12-01-14.49.22.png\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<h2>New AI-driven discovery experience</h2>\n<p>We also love the web, because it has enabled a new generation of content creators like <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/\">Ben Thompson</a>, <a href=\"https://www.schneier.com/\">Bruce Schneier</a>, <a href=\"https://www.swiss-miss.com/\">Tina Eisenberg</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sethgodin.com/\">Seth Godin</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/\">Maria Popova</a>. These independent thinkers continuously explore the edge of the known and share insightful and inspiring ideas with their communities.</p>\n<p>Connecting people to the best sources for the topics that matter to them has been core to our mission since the very start of Feedly, but discovery is a hard problem. The web is organic, a reflection of the global community’s changing needs and priorities. There are millions of sources across thousands of topics, and we all have a different appetite when it comes to feeding our minds.</p>\n<figure class=\"webfeeds-frame-simple webfeeds-size-large\"><img src=\"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/discovery.gif\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<p>As part of this next generation Feedly mobile app, we are launching <a href=\"https://blog.feedly.com/experience-06-discovery-and-the-web/\">a new AI-driven discovery experience</a> which puts the top 50 most interesting sources across 2,000 topics at your fingertips.</p>\n<h2>Power Search</h2>\n<p>Power Search allows you to quickly find specific articles in your Feedly. This powerful search is one of the most-cited reasons for upgrading to Feedly Pro in user surveys. We are excited to bring Power Search to mobile.</p>\n<figure class=\"webfeeds-frame-simple webfeeds-size-large\"><img src=\"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/powersearch.png\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<h2>Notes and highlights</h2>\n<p>The new notes and highlights tools make it easy to annotate articles with your insights, save them for reference, or share them with your colleagues, friends, and followers.</p>\n<figure class=\"webfeeds-frame-simple webfeeds-size-large\"><img src=\"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/annotations.png\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<h2>Feedly Teams</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://feedly.com/i/landing/team\">Feedly Teams</a> allows you to make your industry research, competitive watch, and content curation a more fun and collaborative experience. With the new Feedly mobile app, you can now access all your team feeds, team boards, newsletters, and shared annotations on your phone and tablet.</p>\n<figure class=\"webfeeds-frame-simple webfeeds-size-large\"><img src=\"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/teams.png\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<p>There are more than 7,000 teams relying on Feedly for their research and curation. We hope that the new mobile offering will inspire more users to take advantage of <a href=\"https://feedly.com/i/landing/team\">the free Feedly Team 30-day trial</a>.</p>\n<h2>New Pocket integration</h2>\n<p>If you are a Pocket user, you can connect Feedly to Pocket and replace Read Later with Pocket across the user experience.</p>\n<figure class=\"webfeeds-frame-simple webfeeds-size-large\"><img src=\"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screenshot-2018-11-30-16.16.13.png\" /></figure>\n<h2>New Codebase</h2>\n<p>We have entirely re-implemented the application on a new technology stack.  With a new, modern foundation in place, we are able to iterate faster. For those who are curious, the new app is built using Streets microservices, React for the UI components, and some native extensions when needed.</p>\n<h2>Built collaboratively with 4,000 Feedly users</h2>\n<p>We really enjoyed building the new Feedly in close collaboration with 4,000 Feedly users who volunteered time, expertise, and energy. Your ideas, feedback, and bug reports were critical to the success of the redesign. You’ve helped make Feedly better for everyone.</p>\n<figure class=\"webfeeds-frame-simple webfeeds-size-large\"><img src=\"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screenshot-2018-12-01-15.00.32.png\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<p>We are going to double down on this more collaborative and transparent dev process. You can <a href=\"https://blog.feedly.com/slack-community/\">join the Dev Team and Lab community</a> on Slack and you can <a href=\"https://trello.com/b/bPZDVlwx/feedly-mobileai-lab\">view the roadmap</a> and <a href=\"https://trello.com/b/bPZDVlwx/feedly-mobileai-lab\">upvote features on Trello</a>.</p>\n<p>Finally, if for some reason you prefer the old design, you can look for &#8220;Feedly Classic&#8221; in the App Store or Google Play.</p>\n<p>Happy reading!</p>\n<p>Edwin, Petr, and Emily</p>\n<section class=\"webfeeds-actions\">\n<div class=\"webfeeds-group-buttons\"><a

Some users like to see a mix of images with the article summary, some people prefer to see only text, some people want more density, some less. In Experiment 08, we took that feedback into account and added a new density preference which can be applied to text only, magazine, and card views.

You can keep using your current login credentials and not touch anything, if you wish.</p>\n<p><em>Q: What are the password rules?</em><br />\nYour password must be at least eight characters long. That’s it!</p>\n<p><em>Q: Does my password expire?</em><br />\nNo, it doesn’t expire.</p>\n<p><em>Q: I got an email to confirm my feedly email address. Do I have to click on the link?</em><br />\nThe short answer is yes. It’s a good idea to confirm your email because it will enable you to reset your password if you forget it.</p>\n<p><em>Q: Can I reset my password?</em><br />\nYes, if you forgot your password, you can reset it from the login page and we’ll send you instructions. We can only send an email if you have verified your email address (see above).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a class=\"callforaction\" href=\"https://goo.gl/XsxunU\" target=\"new\">Get our <b>State of Content Marketing report</b></a></p>\n                </div>\n            \n\n           ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 17 Nov 2015 04:57:23 +0000","feedId":887,"bgimg":"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/blog-post-placeholder-dark-4@2x.png","linkMd5":"16aa046a9d62666628eaa9c090d4efef","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn93@2020_2/2020/08/16/13-38-37-882_9ba7d59e41924226.webp","destWidth":2400,"destHeight":1000,"author":"@feedly","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/blog-post-placeholder-dark-4@2x.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx17/cdn38@2020_1/2020/08/16/13-38-43-745_9ba7d59e41924226.webp","https://blog1.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/screenshot-2015-11-11-22-36-13.png":null}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 21:38:35","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 21:38:35","title":"Deduplication Skill – Leo","link":"https://blog.feedly.com/?p=11242","description":"\n              \n                <div>\n                  <div class=\"webfeeds-header\">\n                                                            <div class=\"webfeeds-header__title\"><!-- injected by client --></div>\n                    <div class=\"webfeeds-header__subtitle\">Leo can detect that multiple articles are near exact duplicates of each other and cut the noise from your feeds.</div>                  </div>\n                  <p><a class=\"a2a_button_facebook\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.feedly.com%2Fdeduplication-skill-leo%2F&#38;linkname=Deduplication%20Skill%20%E2%80%93%20Leo\" title=\"Facebook\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_twitter\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.feedly.com%2Fdeduplication-skill-leo%2F&#38;linkname=Deduplication%20Skill%20%E2%80%93%20Leo\" title=\"Twitter\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_linkedin\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.feedly.com%2Fdeduplication-skill-leo%2F&#38;linkname=Deduplication%20Skill%20%E2%80%93%20Leo\" title=\"LinkedIn\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_buffer\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/buffer?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.feedly.com%2Fdeduplication-skill-leo%2F&#38;linkname=Deduplication%20Skill%20%E2%80%93%20Leo\" title=\"Buffer\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"></a></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s frustrating to be skimming through your feeds and run into <g class=\"gr_ gr_11 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace\" id=\"11\" data-gr-id=\"11\">duplicat</g>e articles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This happens, for example, when you have overlapping keyword alerts where two different keywords exist in the same article.

Today, we are excited to announce the beta release of a new <a href=\"https://blog.feedly.com/leo/\">Leo</a> skill called Deduplication.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What is deduplication? </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This skill helps Leo detect that multiple articles are near exact duplicates of each other and cut that noise from your feeds. On the Web version of Feedly, you will see a small notification at the bottom right of your screen each time Leo removes duplicate from your feeds.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Which language does deduplication work on?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Leo deduplication skill works across all languages?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Which Feedly plan does this skill require?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Because processing duplicates at scale is expensive, this skill will be initially rolled out as part of the Feedly Teams plan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are part of Feedly Teams, there is a preference knob in&#160;<a href=\"https://feedly.com/b/account/leo\">the Leo settings page</a> to disable this skill.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Beyond near exact duplicates</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The deduplication skill is focusing on near exact duplicates. These are articles which have 85% or more overlap. We are working on a different skill called Business Events for articles which are reporting on the same event but with different content. In the case of business events, the content will be grouped instead of being removed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Thank you!</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We want to thank you <a
