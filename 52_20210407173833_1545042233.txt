Do you want to speak &#8220;photographer&#8221; like the pros?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s what this article is all about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ll go over some of the most common technical photography terms as well as some less common slang and photographer jargon. By the end, I promise you will have a better grasp of the language. You&#8217;ll even be able to have a conversation with a seasoned pro and hold your own!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s get started.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 data-section id=\"basic-photography-terms\">Basic photography terms</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>These are the photography terms you&#8217;ll find in your camera&#8217;s manual and in most beginner tutorials:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong><a aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">Aperture</a> </strong>– The variable opening in the lens through which light passes to the film or digital sensor.&#160;Aperture is measured in f-stops. I like to compare it to your pupil, which opens and closes to allow more or less light into your eye depending on the brightness level of the room.</li><li><strong><a aria-label=\"Bracketing  (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/bracketing-what-is-it-and-what-to-do-with-the-images/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">Bracketing</a></strong> – Taking a series of images at different exposures. You may see a setting on your camera that says AEB (auto exposure bracketing). Bracketing is often used when creating HDR images or in difficult lighting situations where you may want to have a range of exposures from light to dark.</li><li><strong><a aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/using-bulb-mode-long-exposure-photography/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">Bulb</a> </strong>– the “B” setting on your camera where the shutter remains open for as long as the button or cable release (remote trigger) is pressed.</li><li><strong>DSLR</strong> – A digital single-lens reflex camera. Any digital camera with interchangeable lenses where the image is viewed using a mirror and prism and the image is taken directly through the lens. What you see in your viewfinder is what the lens sees.</li><li><strong><a aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/ev-compensation-explained/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">EV</a></strong> – Exposure value; this is a number that represents the various different combinations of aperture and shutter speed that can create the same exposure effect.</li><li><strong><a aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-use-exposure-compensation-to-take-control-of-your-exposure/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">Exposure compensation</a></strong> – Modifying the shutter speed or aperture from the camera’s recommended exposure to create a certain effect or correct for exposure problems. Your camera reads light bouncing off your subject and is designed to expose for medium gray. So when photographing a subject that is lighter or darker than 18% gray, you can use this setting to tell the camera the proper exposure (by dialing in &#8211; or + exposure compensation).</li><li><strong><a aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/learning-exposure-in-digital-photography/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">Exposure</a></strong> – The total amount of light reaching the digital sensor. It is determined by the aperture, shutter speed, and ISO.</li><li><strong>F-stop</strong> – A measure of the aperture opening in the lens defined by dividing the focal length of the lens by the aperture diameter. The sequence of f-stops features multiples of the square root of 2 (1.4): 1, 1.4, 2, 2.8, 4, 5.6, 8, 11, 16, 22, etc. Though these numbers are rather cryptic, make sure to remember that each step is double the amount of light. Know that, and you&#8217;ve won half the battle.</li><li><strong><a aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/iso-settings/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">ISO</a> </strong>– Represents the sensitivity of your camera’s digital sensor to light. The lower the number (ISO 100), the less sensitive to light; the higher the number (ISO 3200), the more sensitive to light. A higher ISO allows you to shoot in low-light conditions.</li><li><strong><a aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/shutter-speed/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">Shutter speed</a></strong> – The amount of time the shutter is open during an exposure. The shutter speed controls the appearance of motion. Use a fast shutter speed (such as 1/2000s) to freeze motion or a slow shutter speed (such as 1/30s or longer) to blur moving objects.</li><li><strong>Zoom lens</strong> &#8211; Any lens that has a variable focal length, such as a 24-70mm or an 18-55mm lens. You generally zoom in or out by rotating the barrel of the lens.</li><li><strong><a aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/prime-lenses-an-introduction/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">Prime or fixed lens</a></strong> &#8211; Any lens that does not zoom and features a set focal length, such as a nifty 50mm lens.</li><li><strong>Remote trigger or digital cable release</strong> – A device that allows the camera to be fired without pressing the shutter button or touching the camera. Helps eliminate camera movement during long exposures.</li><li><strong><a aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/choose-perfect-macro-lens/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">Macro lens</a></strong> &#8211; A lens that focuses <em>very </em>close to a subject, so you can capture highly detailed, magnified images. </li><li><strong>&#8220;Normal&#8221; lens</strong>&#160;&#8211; Generally a 50mm lens (on a full-frame camera). This lens closely parallels what the human eye sees.&#160;If you have a crop-sensor camera, a &#8220;normal&#8221; lens will be closer to 35mm.</li><li><strong>Telephoto lens</strong> &#8211; Offers a tighter field of view than a normal lens (i.e., it takes more magnified images). Generally from around 70mm to 300mm. A super-telephoto lens is usually 300mm or longer.</li><li><strong>Wide-angle lens</strong> &#8211; A lens that features a wider field of view than a normal lens. Generally spans from over 10mm to under 50mm. Depending on the focal length, there may also be edge distortion (i.e., in super wide-angle lenses).</li><li><strong>Tilt-shift lens</strong> &#8211; A special-effect lens. Allows for realignment of the plane of focus (tilt). Allows for adjusting the placement of the subject within the frame without angling the camera, thus keeping parallel lines from converging (shift). A popular lens for architectural and landscape photographers and is becoming more widely used by portrait photographers to create a unique, stylized look.</li><li><strong><a aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/image-resolution-explained/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">Camera resolution</a></strong> &#8211; The dimensions your camera&#8217;s sensor is capable of capturing, expressed in megapixels. This is not the only factor in image quality, but the greater the resolution, the larger the prints you can produce without significant loss of quality (generally speaking).</li><li><strong><a aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/raw-vs-jpeg/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">JPEG vs RAW</a>&#160;</strong>&#8211; Two different image file types. Most cameras have the ability to shoot in JPEG and RAW. If you choose JPEG, the camera will shoot a RAW file, process it using the picture style you&#8217;ve selected in your menu, save it as a JPEG, and discard the RAW version. If you choose RAW, the resulting file will be larger, carry more information, and require software to process. It gives you &#8211; the photographer &#8211; more control over the final look of the image.</li><li><strong><a aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/camera-sensors-explained/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">Full-frame vs crop/APS-C sensor</a></strong> &#8211; A full-frame sensor is roughly the size of 35mm film. Most lenses create a circle of light just large enough to cover the 35mm sensor area. But in a crop-sensor camera, the physical size of the sensor is smaller; it only captures a portion of the entire image the lens is projecting, effectively cropping out part of the shot. Common crop factors are 1.5x and 1.6x, so if you use a 50mm lens on an APS-C camera, it offers a 75mm focal length equivalent.</li><li><strong><a aria-label=\"Camera modes (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/camera-modes-explained-for-newbies/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">Camera modes</a></strong> &#8211; There are four standard camera modes. Auto mode selects settings without user input. Manual mode allows the user to control the ISO, shutter speed, and aperture. Shutter Priority mode allows the user to select the ISO and shutter speed while the camera selects the aperture. <a href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture-and-shutter-priority-modes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">Aperture Priority</a> mode allows the user to select the ISO and aperture while the camera picks the shutter speed. Program mode allows the user to select the ISO while the camera picks the aperture and shutter speed.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 data-section id=\"lighting-and-portrait-photography-terms\">Lighting and portrait photography terms</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Ambient light</strong> &#8211; Also referred to as available light. Ambient light occurs in the scene without adding any flash or light modifiers. It can be daylight, or it can be artificial light such as tungsten or fluorescent bulbs.</li><li><strong>Main light or key light</strong> &#8211; The main light source for a photograph. It could be the sun, a studio strobe, a flash, a reflector, or something else. It&#8217;s the source that produces the pattern of light on the subject with the most intensity.</li><li><strong><a aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/fill-light-in-portrait-photography/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">Fill light</a></strong> &#8211; The light source that is secondary to the key light. Used to “fill” in the shadows. Can be produced with a flash, a reflector, or a studio strobe.</li><li><strong><a href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/6-portrait-lighting-patterns-every-photographer-should-know/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">Lighting pattern</a></strong> &#8211; The way the light falls on the subject&#8217;s face (e.g., at a 45-degree angle).</li><li><strong><a href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/lighting-ratios-to-make-or-break-your-portrait/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">Lighting ratio</a></strong> &#8211; A comparison between the intensity (brightness) of the main light and the fill light. In other words: the difference between the lit and shadow sides of the subject&#8217;s face.</li><li><strong>Incident light meter</strong> &#8211; A handheld device that measures the amount of light falling on a subject. An incident meter is not fooled by the brightness range of the subject, whereas in-camera reflective meters can be fooled (resulting in overexposure and underexposure).</li><li><strong><a aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/starting-with-off-camera-flash-techniques/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">Speedlight</a></strong> &#8211; A small, portable flash that can attach to your camera’s hot shoe or stand on its own when activated remotely.</li><li><strong><a aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/6-ways-of-using-reflector-to-take-better-portraits/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">Reflector</a></strong> &#8211; A device used to reflect light (generally back toward the subject). It can be a specialized, factory-made reflector (I recommend getting a <a aria-label=\"5-in-1 (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/10-ways-use-5-1-reflector/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">5-in-1</a>), or a piece of white cardboard.</li><li><strong>Light meter</strong> &#8211; A device that measures the amount of light in a scene. Pretty much all modern cameras offer a built-in light meter, though it uses reflective readings (see the entry on <em>incident light meters</em>, above).</li><li><strong>Remote flash trigger </strong>&#8211; A device used to fire speedlights off-camera.</li><li><strong>Subtractive lighting</strong> &#8211; Taking away light to create a darker look. It often involves holding a reflector or an opaque panel over the subject&#8217;s head to block light from above and open up deep eye shadows caused by overhead lighting. It can also involve holding a black reflector opposite your main light to create a deeper shadow (i.e., essentially reflecting black onto the subject instead of light.)</li><li><strong><a aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/use-hard-lighting-create-dramatic-portrait/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">Hard light</a> </strong>&#8211; Harsh or non-diffused light such as that produced by bright sunlight, a small speedlight, or an on-camera flash. Creates harsh shadows with well-defined edges, contrast, and texture (if used at an angle to the subject). Emphasizes texture, lines, and wrinkles. Often used to create a more dramatic type of portrait.</li><li><strong><a aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/the-magic-of-soft-light/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">Soft light</a></strong> &#8211; Diffused light, such as that from an overcast sky, north-facing window with no direct light, or a large studio softbox. This type of light produces soft shadows with soft edges, lower contrast, and less texture. Soft light is generally preferred by most wedding and portrait photographers because it flatters the subject.</li><li><strong>Edge transfer</strong> &#8211; How quickly shadow edges go from dark to light. With harsh light, the edge transfer is very defined and sudden (almost a clear line). With soft lighting, the edge transfer is much more subtle &#8211; almost imperceptible &#8211; as it gradually changes from dark to light.</li><li><strong><a aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/understand-flash-sync-speed-so-you-dont-sink-your-photo-shoot/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">Flash sync</a> </strong>&#8211; The synchronization of the firing of an electronic flash and the shutter speed. You need to know what shutter speed your camera syncs at; otherwise, if you use a too-fast shutter speed, you may get a partially illuminated image. For most cameras, the sync speed is around 1/200s.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 data-section id=\"slang-and-photography-jargon\">Slang and photography jargon</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are a few other photography terms that are a bit more advanced (including some wacky jargon and slang!). Become familiar with this terminology so you can talk to pros with confidence.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Fast glass</strong> – Refers to a lens with a very large maximum aperture (such as f/1.8 or f/1.2). The lens is &#8220;fast&#8221; because it lets you shoot with a fast shutter speed.</li><li><strong><a aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/getting-the-chimp-off-your-back/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">Chimping</a></strong> &#8211; Slang term for looking at the back of your camera after every image. Has a negative connotation; if you <em>chimp</em>, you&#8217;re spending too much time reviewing images on the camera and not enough time shooting.</li><li><strong><a aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-achieve-nice-bokeh-in-plain-english/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">Bokeh</a></strong> &#8211; The out-of-focus blurred bits in an image background. Most often bokeh occurs when small light sources are in the background.</li><li><a aria-label=\"Depth of field (DOF or DoF) (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/understanding-depth-field-beginners/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\"><strong>Depth of field</strong> <strong>(DOF or DoF)</strong></a> &#8211; The distance between the nearest and farthest objects in your scene that appear in focus. Controlled by many factors, including the aperture, lens focal length, and distance to the subject.</li><li><strong><a aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-find-and-use-hyperfocal-distance-for-sharp-backgrounds/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">Hyperfocal distance</a></strong> &#8211; The focus distance providing the maximum depth of field for a particular aperture and focal length. Older prime lenses often have hyperfocal distance marks to aid in finding this depth-of-field sweet spot. With today&#8217;s lenses, it is possible to calculate the hyperfocal distance, but it takes a bit more work and a hyperfocal distance calculator.</li><li><strong><a aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/using-gobos-to-create-dramatic-lighting/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">Gobo</a></strong> &#8211; Something used to block unwanted or stray light from falling onto the subject. Often the dark side of a reflector is used as a gobo.</li><li><strong><a aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-make-a-diy-light-panel-or-scrim/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">Scrim</a></strong> &#8211; A translucent device used to diffuse and soften the light. Can be a reflector with a translucent panel. Scrims can be made extremely large and clamped in place to create shade even in direct sunlight.</li><li><strong>Shutter lag</strong> &#8211; The slight delay from the time you press the shutter button to the time the shutter actually opens. In DSLRs and mirrorless cameras, shutter lag is minimal and almost unnoticeable. In smaller point-and-shoot cameras, the delay is more pronounced (and can cause you to miss shots of fast-moving subjects).</li><li><strong><a aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/chromatic-aberration-what-is-it-and-how-to-avoid-it/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">Chromatic aberration</a></strong> &#8211; Color fringing that can appear in areas of images where dark meets light (e.g., the edge of a building against the sky). CA is correctable to a great degree using Photoshop, Lightroom, and most other editing software.</li><li><strong>Rear-curtain sync </strong>&#8211; Rear-curtain sync fires the flash at the end of an exposure. By default, most cameras are set to front-curtain sync (i.e., if the flash fires, it does so at the beginning of the exposure). When shooting a moving subject, front-curtain sync will put any motion blur in front of the subject, whereas rear-curtain sync will place the blur <em>behind </em>the subject. Neither is wrong; it depends on the effect you&#8217;re after.</li><li><strong><a aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-avoid-camera-shake/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">Camera shake</a></strong> &#8211; When a camera moves during an exposure and creates blur.</li><li><strong><a aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-use-lens-flare-to-your-advantage/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">Lens flare</a></strong> &#8211; Stray light that creates haze, circles, or other artifacts in an image.  Some photographers actually desire lens flare; they position their cameras to create flare and use it as a compositional element.</li><li><strong>Kelvin</strong> &#8211; The absolute measurement of color temperature. Lower numbers represent warmer colors like orange (tungsten light), whereas the higher numbers are cooler (blues). Play with the color temperature to create different effects.</li><li><strong><a aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/neutral-density-filters-landscape-photos/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">ND filter</a></strong> &#8211; Stands for <em>neutral density filter</em>. It&#8217;s a filter designed to go in front of the lens to block out some of the light entering the camera. Often used by landscape photographers to get slow shutter speeds when photographing waterfalls and streams in full daylight.</li><li><strong><a aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/mastering-panning-to-photograph-moving-subjects/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">Panning</a></strong> &#8211; The act of using a slow shutter speed and moving the camera in the same direction as a moving subject. Creates an artistic, blurred background.</li><li><strong>Stopping down</strong> &#8211; Closing down the aperture to a smaller opening (e.g., going from f/5.6 to f/8).</li><li><strong><a aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/understand-flash-settings-ttl-manual/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">TTL and ETTL</a></strong> &#8211; TTL stands for <em>through the lens</em>; it refers to the metering system in regard to flash exposure. The flash emits light until it is turned off by the camera sensor. ETTL stands for <em>evaluative through-the-lens metering</em>. It fires a &#8220;preflash&#8221; to evaluate and calculate for lost light, then compensates and fires the main flash. It happens so fast you do not see two flashes.</li><li><strong>Photog</strong> &#8211; Short for &#8220;photographer.&#8221; Something pros often call each other.</li><li><strong>Glass</strong> &#8211; A lens. As in, &#8220;What glass do you own?&#8221;</li><li><strong><a aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/how-photograph-golden-hour/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">Golden hour</a></strong> &#8211; Also called &#8220;magic hour.&#8221; This is the hour or two right before sunset and right after sunrise. The sun is low on the horizon, and it is an optimal time for photography.</li><li><strong>Spray and pray</strong> &#8211; Shoot as many images as possible while praying you get something good.</li><li><strong>Blown out</strong> &#8211; An image with no details in the white areas.</li><li><strong>Clipped</strong> &#8211; Either blown out areas (above) or dark, detailless shadows.</li><li><strong>Grip-and-grin</strong> &#8211; A quick photoshoot at an event or a setup with two people shaking hands. Most portrait and event photographers have to shoot these at some point in their careers.</li><li><strong>Selfie</strong> &#8211; A self-portrait.</li><li><strong>SOOC</strong> &#8211; Straight out of camera; an image with no post-processing.</li><li><strong>Dust bunnies</strong> &#8211; Dark spots that appear on an image caused by bits of dust on the digital sensor.</li><li><strong>Pixel peeper</strong> &#8211; Someone who spends too much time looking at images magnified in Photoshop.</li><li><strong><a aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/nifty-fifties-%E2%80%93-why-i-love-50mm-prime-lenses/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">Nifty fifty</a> </strong>&#8211; A 50mm prime lens.

You didn&#8217;t think about it and made your shot with a <a aria-label=\"smaller aperture (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">smaller aperture</a>, wide focal length, or both. Or perhaps you&#8217;re dealing with a smartphone image, where a small sensor size and a very short focal length almost always creates images with everything in focus.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image caption-align-left is-style-with-caption\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><span class=\"responsive-image wp-image-202713\" style=\"width:2560px\"><span class=\"space\" style=\"width:2560px; padding-top:68.16%\"></span><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1745\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Hazyl-Rakes-v2-scaled.jpg?resize=2560%2C1745&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"how to blur the background in Lightroom\" class=\"wp-image-202713\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Hazyl-Rakes-v2-scaled.jpg?w=2560&#38;ssl=1 2560w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Hazyl-Rakes-v2-scaled.jpg?resize=300%2C205&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Hazyl-Rakes-v2-scaled.jpg?resize=600%2C409&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Hazyl-Rakes-v2-scaled.jpg?resize=768%2C524&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Hazyl-Rakes-v2-scaled.jpg?resize=1536%2C1047&#38;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Hazyl-Rakes-v2-scaled.jpg?resize=2048%2C1396&#38;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Hazyl-Rakes-v2-scaled.jpg?resize=90%2C60&#38;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Hazyl-Rakes-v2-scaled.jpg?resize=717%2C489&#38;ssl=1 717w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></span><figcaption>Smartphone photos typically have a deep depth of field due to the small sensors and very short focal lengths.

It will work, but using it to blur your background probably ought to be thought of as a &#8220;rescue mission.&#8221; I don&#8217;t want to discourage you &#8211; Lightroom often can produce a very acceptable blur &#8211; but I&#8217;d strongly encourage you to shoot multiple images during your photo session and vary the aperture if you think you might want to soften the background.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But all the <em>coulda</em>, <em>woulda</em>, and <em>shoulda </em>regrets over how you might have made a better in-camera capture don&#8217;t count when the session is over, the images are already made, and Lightroom is the only editing tool you have. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So let me show you how to blur the background in Lightroom.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image caption-align-left is-style-with-caption\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><span class=\"responsive-image wp-image-202708\" style=\"width:1200px\"><span class=\"space\" style=\"width:1200px; padding-top:66.67%\"></span><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Rockchuck.gif?resize=1200%2C800&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"How to Blue the Background in Lightroom - The rock chuck\" class=\"wp-image-202708\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/></span><figcaption>&#8220;Chuck&#8221; the rockchuck blended in a bit too much with the background.

Then think about other areas that would be sharp if you had shot with a limited depth of field, such as the foreground. Erase those areas, too, making sure to use a very feathered brush with a low flow. After your image is masked, drag down the <strong>Sharpness</strong> slider to create the blur. (It&#8217;s good to toggle off the <strong>Mask Overlay</strong> here so you can see what you&#8217;re doing; just hit &#8220;O&#8221; on the keyboard to toggle it on and off.)</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s probably best to think of your filter brush more as an airbrush than a paintbrush. There are four settings you can use to control its application:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Size</strong>: Changes the size of the brush. Roll the mouse wheel, use the left and right bracket keys, or use the slider.</li><li><strong>Feather</strong>: Changes how hard the edge of the brush is and how rapidly the effect falls off. Use <strong>Shift</strong> while rolling the mouse wheel, <strong>Shift</strong> and the bracket keys together, or the <strong>Feather</strong> slider.</li><li><strong>Flow</strong>: Controls how quickly the effect is applied with each stroke of the brush. Use the slider to adjust the flow, or with the brush tool selected, change the flow with the number keys on the keyboard. Using multiple strokes will build up the effect.</li><li><strong>Density</strong>: Controls the maximum opacity of the brush effect. For example, if the Flow was at 100 but the Density was at 50, one stroke of the brush would apply the effect at 50% opacity.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>It is possible to simply select the Adjustment Brush, drag the sharpness slider all the way down (&#8220;reverse sharpening&#8221;), and start painting away on your image, watching the painted sections become more blurred. (You are still creating a mask this way, but you will not see it unless you turn on the Mask Overlay). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Adjustment Brush method might work fine if you don&#8217;t mind being imprecise about how finely the blur is applied, but it is not the best method for finer work.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 data-section id=\"radial-filter\">Radial Filter</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Radial Filter has a shape that is restricted to circles and ovals. The effect radiates out from the center of the spot where it is applied. You can control its size, feathering, and orientation. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using the <strong>Invert</strong> checkbox, you can also control whether the filter effect occurs outside the oval (the default), or inside the oval (if the <strong>Invert </strong>box is checked).</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image caption-align-left is-style-with-caption\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><span class=\"responsive-image wp-image-202698\" style=\"width:1500px\"><span class=\"space\" style=\"width:1500px; padding-top:18.53%\"></span><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"278\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Barn-Blur.jpg?resize=1500%2C278&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"How to blue the background in Lightroom the Radial filter\" class=\"wp-image-202698\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Barn-Blur.jpg?w=1500&#38;ssl=1 1500w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Barn-Blur.jpg?resize=300%2C56&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Barn-Blur.jpg?resize=600%2C111&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Barn-Blur.jpg?resize=768%2C142&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Barn-Blur.jpg?resize=717%2C133&#38;ssl=1 717w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></span><figcaption>Blurring the background with the Radial Filter is a three-step process: <br /><br />1) Mask the entire image with the Radial Filter.

When doing so, you will see a &#8220;+&#8221; symbol at the center of the brush. Clicking the <strong>Erase </strong>option will change the symbol at the center of the brush to a &#8220;-&#8221; symbol so that you can erase portions of the mask you already painted on. You can also easily switch from painting to erasing by holding down the <strong>Alt/Option</strong> key.</li><li>You can add or subtract from Graduated Filter or Radial Filter masks with the filter brush tool. If you are working with a Graduated or Radial Filter mask, you will see the word &#8220;Brush&#8221; appear to the right of the word &#8220;Mask.&#8221; <strong>Important</strong>: This is a different brush than the Adjustment Brush tool. It will allow you to add to or subtract from your existing Graduated Filter or Radial Filter mask.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 data-section id=\"range-masking\">Range masking</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Lightroom has recently added what is called the <strong><a href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/range-mask-lightroom-classic-cc/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">Range Mask</a></strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With Range Masking, you still apply an initial mask using the three tools mentioned above (the Adjustment Brush, the Radial Filter, and the Graduated Filter). But by turning on Range Masking, you can control more specifically where the mask is applied. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Luminance Range Mask will allow you to selectively apply a mask to a range of luminance (brightness) in the photo, while Color Range Masking allows the mask to be applied to a range of color (hue). Being proficient with the Range Mask will serve you well as you become a more skilled Lightroom editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image caption-align-left is-style-with-caption\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><span class=\"responsive-image wp-image-202699\" style=\"width:1500px\"><span class=\"space\" style=\"width:1500px; padding-top:68.2%\"></span><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1023\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Color-Masking-Steps.jpg?resize=1500%2C1023&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Range Masking and blurring with Lightroom\" class=\"wp-image-202699\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Color-Masking-Steps.jpg?w=1500&#38;ssl=1 1500w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Color-Masking-Steps.jpg?resize=300%2C205&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Color-Masking-Steps.jpg?resize=600%2C409&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Color-Masking-Steps.jpg?resize=768%2C524&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Color-Masking-Steps.jpg?resize=90%2C60&#38;ssl=1 90w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Color-Masking-Steps.jpg?resize=717%2C489&#38;ssl=1 717w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></span><figcaption>Clockwise from top left: 1) the Before image. 2) The background selected with the Color Range Mask. 3) The background blurred with one blur layer. 4) The background blurred with three duplicate blur layers.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Learning how to create a mask to work with the areas you want is the most important part of how to blur the background in Lightroom.

It&#8217;s the more time-consuming and critical step. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But these next steps will determine how the blur looks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s say you have a person in your foreground as the main subject. You want them to be sharp, but you&#8217;d like to blur the background. Using the masking tools and techniques I&#8217;ve outlined above, here&#8217;s how I&#8217;d approach the image:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Drag a <strong>Graduated Filter</strong> across the image so the entire scene is masked.</li><li>Use the filter brush tool (the one that&#8217;s part of the Graduated Filter) to fine-tune the mask, erasing portions over the subject, adding back as needed, and perhaps also using the <strong>Auto Mask</strong> feature to help you better mask near the edges.</li><li>Now, with your Graduated Filter selected, drag the <strong>Sharpness </strong>slider down, perhaps all the way to the left. </li><li>See if dragging down the <a aria-label=\"Clarity slider (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/four-ways-improve-photos-clarity-slider-lightroom/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\"><strong>Clarity </strong>slider</a> a bit helps achieve the blur you want. Use this more sparingly than the Sharpness slider as it can create a strange look if applied too strongly.</li><li>Play with the other sliders to see what effect they might have. Remember that each slider will <em>only </em>affect the masked area.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 data-section id=\"double-down-on-the-blur\">Double down on the blur</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You might find that even if you drag your Sharpness or Clarity sliders all the way to the left, you still aren&#8217;t getting the amount of blur you&#8217;d like. Time to double down. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve added the sharpening or clarity effect, right-click the pin and hit <strong>Duplicate</strong>. A copy of the adjustments will be applied on top of the existing adjustments, and the blur will be multiplied. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still not enough? Repeat and duplicate again. You can make as many duplicates as you like, slowly building up the effect. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image caption-align-left is-style-with-caption\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><span class=\"responsive-image wp-image-202703\" style=\"width:1151px\"><span class=\"space\" style=\"width:1151px; padding-top:130.32%\"></span><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1151\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Rick-MC-4-up-progression.jpg?resize=1151%2C1500&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"how to blur the background in Lightroom man with bike\" class=\"wp-image-202703\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Rick-MC-4-up-progression.jpg?w=1151&#38;ssl=1 1151w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Rick-MC-4-up-progression.jpg?resize=230%2C300&#38;ssl=1 230w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Rick-MC-4-up-progression.jpg?resize=460%2C600&#38;ssl=1 460w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Rick-MC-4-up-progression.jpg?resize=768%2C1001&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Rick-MC-4-up-progression.jpg?resize=717%2C934&#38;ssl=1 717w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></span><figcaption>Top left: The Before image.

Softening details with editing is a bit of fakery and cannot begin to truly reproduce the kind of <a aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-achieve-nice-bokeh-in-plain-english/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">bokeh blur</a> achieved with a lens. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So instead of creating something that is immediately obvious and calls attention to itself, be subtle. If an untrained observer would say, &#8220;This looks like an editing effect,&#8221; you&#8217;ve failed.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image caption-align-left is-style-with-caption\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><span class=\"responsive-image wp-image-202709\" style=\"width:1200px\"><span class=\"space\" style=\"width:1200px; padding-top:66.67%\"></span><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/tw200.gif?resize=1200%2C800&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"reverse sharpening bike on prairie\" class=\"wp-image-202709\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/></span><figcaption>Less can be more. Just a little reverse sharpening to the background and foreground simulates a narrow depth of field.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Spend whatever time it takes to create and refine your masks so that it&#8217;s <em>not </em>obvious where the edge is. Consider the different parts of the scene that should &#8211; and shouldn&#8217;t! &#8211; be blurred. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then be <em>sparing </em>in your application of reverse sharpness and clarity. It&#8217;s always a good practice to take a break after an editing session to give your eyes a rest, then look at your image again later. You might even ask someone else to view the image. (They should not be able to tell that anything was doctored.)</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image caption-align-left is-style-with-caption\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><span class=\"responsive-image wp-image-202711\" style=\"width:1200px\"><span class=\"space\" style=\"width:1200px; padding-top:66.67%\"></span><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Meridian-Motors.gif?resize=1200%2C800&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"police motorbikes in a line\" class=\"wp-image-202711\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/></span><figcaption>Front-to-back sharpness or a simulation of limited depth of field?

And if you get good results, post some of your before and after images in the comments below! </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block\"><div class=\"schema-faq-section\" id=\"faq-question-1611438047680\"><strong class=\"schema-faq-question\">Why should you blur the background of a photo?</strong> <p class=\"schema-faq-answer\">You should always decide on the most important subject in your photo and use techniques to put the most attention on that subject. Sometimes backgrounds can be distracting, so blurring them while keeping the main subject sharp can be a good idea.</p> </div> <div class=\"schema-faq-section\" id=\"faq-question-1611438189861\"><strong class=\"schema-faq-question\">Is Lightroom a good application for blurring the background?</strong> <p class=\"schema-faq-answer\">It works, but you will be using tools not especially created for this purpose. Adobe Photoshop or a different editing application with selections, layers, and Gaussian blur would be better.</p> </div> <div class=\"schema-faq-section\" id=\"faq-question-1611438214741\"><strong class=\"schema-faq-question\">Is there a Blur tool in Lightroom?</strong> <p class=\"schema-faq-answer\">Not really. To blur backgrounds in Lightroom, you add reverse sharpness and reverse clarity over selected portions of the image.</p> </div> <div class=\"schema-faq-section\" id=\"faq-question-1611438399001\"><strong class=\"schema-faq-question\">What is the best way to blur the background in a photo?</strong> <p class=\"schema-faq-answer\">The best way is to shoot your photos with a limited depth of field. Wide apertures and longer focal lengths would be the in-camera approach to the blurred background look.</p> </div> <div class=\"schema-faq-section\" id=\"faq-question-1611438849262\"><strong class=\"schema-faq-question\">Will the &#8220;Portrait mode&#8221; of newer smartphone cameras allow you to blur the background?</strong> <p class=\"schema-faq-answer\">Yes, this mode actually takes multiple shots and combines them in-camera to create a blurred background effect. It might be better than what you can do in Lightroom, but it provides limited user control and is not nearly as good as what can be done with a traditional camera.</p> </div> </div>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-blur-the-background-in-lightroom/\">How to Blur the Background in Lightroom: A Complete Guide</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com\">Digital Photography School</a>.

Here, a shutter speed of a few seconds or more is necessary for an accurate exposure of the scene, and any movement captured in the image is magically transformed into a thing of beauty. If your camera is steady on a tripod, buildings remain in sharp focus, but the movement of car headlights or rushing water is captured as interesting streaks in the image:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image caption-align-left is-style-with-caption\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><span class=\"responsive-image wp-image-205531\" style=\"width:1500px\"><span class=\"space\" style=\"width:1500px; padding-top:60.13%\"></span><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"902\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TopPlacesNDFilters7.jpg?resize=1500%2C902&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"harbor with bridge and city\" class=\"wp-image-205531\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TopPlacesNDFilters7.jpg?w=1500&#38;ssl=1 1500w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TopPlacesNDFilters7.jpg?resize=300%2C180&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TopPlacesNDFilters7.jpg?resize=600%2C361&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TopPlacesNDFilters7.jpg?resize=768%2C462&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TopPlacesNDFilters7.jpg?resize=717%2C431&#38;ssl=1 717w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></span><figcaption>A neutral density filter can be a photographer&#8217;s best friend.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Capturing this kind of effect can only be done after dark, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wrong. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With an ND filter, you can take stunning long exposures during the day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You see, if you don&#8217;t use an ND filter, a long exposure in bright daylight conditions would result in an overexposed image. But with an ND filter reducing the amount of light that reaches the sensor, you need to use a much slower <a aria-label=\"shutter speed (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/shutter-speed/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">shutter speed</a> to photograph the scene. This allows you to capture movement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are so many amazing places where you can use an ND filter to take stunning long exposure photos. I’ve listed some of my favorites below, starting with:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 data-section id=\"waterfalls\">1. Waterfalls</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a aria-label=\"Waterfalls (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/waterfall-digital-photography/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">Waterfalls</a> are the place many photographers try out their ND filters for the first time. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>They&#8217;re certainly a fantastic location for you to start; flowing water is transformed into a silky-soft cascade, which gives images a real <em>wow </em>factor. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just watch out for mist and water spray and make sure it doesn&#8217;t cover your filter and lens!</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image caption-align-left is-style-with-caption\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><span class=\"responsive-image wp-image-205532\" style=\"width:1000px\"><span class=\"space\" style=\"width:1000px; padding-top:150%\"></span><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TopPlacesNDFilters2.jpg?resize=1000%2C1500&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"waterfall long exposure\" class=\"wp-image-205532\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TopPlacesNDFilters2.jpg?w=1000&#38;ssl=1 1000w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TopPlacesNDFilters2.jpg?resize=200%2C300&#38;ssl=1 200w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TopPlacesNDFilters2.jpg?resize=400%2C600&#38;ssl=1 400w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TopPlacesNDFilters2.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TopPlacesNDFilters2.jpg?resize=717%2C1076&#38;ssl=1 717w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></span><figcaption>Waterfalls are a popular place to try out an ND filter. <br />Captured with my <a href=\"https://geni.us/Fujifilm16mmf1-4\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"Fujifilm 16mm f/1.4 lens (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" class=\"ek-link\">Fujifilm 16mm f/1.4 lens</a> at Springbrook National Park in Queensland.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The intensity of a waterfall can depend on recent rainfall. But the good news is that, no matter how large or small the waterfall is, it&#8217;ll look amazing when shot with an ND filter. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 data-section id=\"rivers-and-harbors\">2. Rivers and harbors</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Rivers and harbors are fantastic places to capture movement and lights along with the flow of water. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>During daylight hours, it’s possible to capture the movement of boats along the water. And as the sun goes down and the city lights come on, ferries and boats create colorful light trails that can bring an image to life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love this image of a ferry on Sydney Harbour:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image caption-align-left is-style-with-caption\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><span class=\"responsive-image wp-image-205535\" style=\"width:1200px\"><span class=\"space\" style=\"width:1200px; padding-top:125%\"></span><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TopPlacesNDFilters5.jpg?resize=1200%2C1500&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"harbor long exposure\" class=\"wp-image-205535\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TopPlacesNDFilters5.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TopPlacesNDFilters5.jpg?resize=240%2C300&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TopPlacesNDFilters5.jpg?resize=480%2C600&#38;ssl=1 480w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TopPlacesNDFilters5.jpg?resize=768%2C960&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TopPlacesNDFilters5.jpg?resize=717%2C896&#38;ssl=1 717w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></span><figcaption>Rivers and harbors provide an array of long exposure opportunities.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to my ND filter, I was able to use a shutter speed of around 1s, giving the ferry a nice, colorful blur (while buildings behind it remain in sharp focus). </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 data-section id=\"ocean-pools\">3. Ocean pools</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Saltwater ocean pools dot the Australian coastline, with most of them found in the state of New South Wales. The pools are very popular with locals and tourists alike and can get very busy each morning. But the good thing about these iconic locations is that you have another body of water to photograph alongside the sea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This image was taken early one morning in Yamba, New South Wales:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image caption-align-left is-style-default\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><span class=\"responsive-image wp-image-205533\" style=\"width:1500px\"><span class=\"space\" style=\"width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%\"></span><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TopPlacesNDFilters4.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"ND filters for long exposure photography ocean pool\" class=\"wp-image-205533\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TopPlacesNDFilters4.jpg?w=1500&#38;ssl=1 1500w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TopPlacesNDFilters4.jpg?resize=300%2C200&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TopPlacesNDFilters4.jpg?resize=600%2C400&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TopPlacesNDFilters4.jpg?resize=768%2C512&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TopPlacesNDFilters4.jpg?resize=90%2C60&#38;ssl=1 90w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TopPlacesNDFilters4.jpg?resize=717%2C478&#38;ssl=1 717w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></span></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>I framed the pool in the foreground with the sea and the cliffs in the background. As I was taking a series of long exposures with a <a aria-label=\"ND10 filter (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://geni.us/BreakthroughPhotoND10\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" class=\"ek-link\">10-stop ND filter</a>, a swimmer jumped out of the pool right in front of me, creating a ghostly figure in the foreground of the frame. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The image below was taken at 6 AM (when it was already very bright). I was attracted to the scene by the reflections in the flooded area next to the pool, which contrasted nicely with the pool&#8217;s ethereal-looking water and the waves of the ocean on the far left.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image caption-align-left is-style-with-caption\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><span class=\"responsive-image wp-image-205534\" style=\"width:1500px\"><span class=\"space\" style=\"width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%\"></span><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TopPlacesNDFilters3.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"ocean pool ND filters for long exposure photography\" class=\"wp-image-205534\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TopPlacesNDFilters3.jpg?w=1500&#38;ssl=1 1500w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TopPlacesNDFilters3.jpg?resize=300%2C200&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TopPlacesNDFilters3.jpg?resize=600%2C400&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TopPlacesNDFilters3.jpg?resize=768%2C512&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TopPlacesNDFilters3.jpg?resize=90%2C60&#38;ssl=1 90w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TopPlacesNDFilters3.jpg?resize=717%2C478&#38;ssl=1 717w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></span><figcaption>I love the three different bodies of water in this ocean pool shot.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 data-section id=\"traffic\">4.

Well after the sun has sunk below the horizon, a shutter speed of between 5 and 15 seconds is often needed to create a properly exposed shot, resulting in a colorful blur of traffic trails.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if you have an ND filter, there’s no need to wait until after dark. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a composite of images I took with my <a href=\"https://geni.us/UrthFilterND2\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"ND2 filter (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" class=\"ek-link\">ND2 filter</a> at a subway station in Taipei, Taiwan: </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image caption-align-left is-style-with-caption\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><span class=\"responsive-image wp-image-190291\" style=\"width:1000px\"><span class=\"space\" style=\"width:1000px; padding-top:150%\"></span><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/MM-dPS-Taiwan.jpg?resize=1000%2C1500&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"city long exposure\" class=\"wp-image-190291\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/MM-dPS-Taiwan.jpg?w=1000&#38;ssl=1 1000w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/MM-dPS-Taiwan.jpg?resize=200%2C300&#38;ssl=1 200w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/MM-dPS-Taiwan.jpg?resize=400%2C600&#38;ssl=1 400w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/MM-dPS-Taiwan.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/MM-dPS-Taiwan.jpg?resize=717%2C1076&#38;ssl=1 717w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></span><figcaption>A composite image of dusk in Taipei, Taiwan.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>I knew I needed an exposure of a few seconds to make the most of the traffic and the subway train in the image. But it was too bright, and my exposure times were barely a second. Adding an ND filter allowed me to capture this scene as I had envisioned, and the final file is a composite of some of those long-exposure images.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 data-section id=\"funfairs\">5. Funfairs</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Funfairs and carnivals are fantastic places for photography. There are so many opportunities: people, rides, food, and animals, to name just a few. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And when the sun goes down, don’t head home &#8211; set up your tripod for some long exposure images.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s exactly what I did for this image of a sideshow alley at Brisbane&#8217;s Royal Queensland show four years ago. The photo has been shared on Instagram every year since &#8211; sometimes with my permission, sometimes without. With an ND2 filter, I was able to take exposures that were twice as long as usual.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image caption-align-left is-style-with-caption\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><span class=\"responsive-image wp-image-205530\" style=\"width:1000px\"><span class=\"space\" style=\"width:1000px; padding-top:150%\"></span><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TopPlacesNDFilters6.jpg?resize=1000%2C1500&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"fair in Brisbane long exposure\" class=\"wp-image-205530\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TopPlacesNDFilters6.jpg?w=1000&#38;ssl=1 1000w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TopPlacesNDFilters6.jpg?resize=200%2C300&#38;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TopPlacesNDFilters6.jpg?resize=400%2C600&#38;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TopPlacesNDFilters6.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TopPlacesNDFilters6.jpg?resize=717%2C1076&#38;ssl=1 717w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></span><figcaption>My images of this funfair in Brisbane have been very popular on Instagram.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 data-section id=\"unique-natural-attractions\">6.
