There are shades of school shooting trauma here too, and while you wouldn&#8217;t think this cocktail would entirely work it absolutely does. Katherine Langford and Charlie Plummer shine, the blood is frequent and copious, and the ending packs an emotional punch. Give this one a spin.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>The Many Faces of Russell Crowe</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-364606\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/russell-crowe-master-and-commander-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"Russell Crowe Master And Commander\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/russell-crowe-master-and-commander-800x533.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/russell-crowe-master-and-commander-1090x726.jpg 1090w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/russell-crowe-master-and-commander-768x512.jpg 768w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/russell-crowe-master-and-commander.jpg 1100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p>Run a poll asking people to name a film they wish had received a sequel, and the odds are quite good that Peter Weir&#8217;s <strong><em>Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World</em></strong> (2003) will rank pretty damn high. Based on the acclaimed series of novels by Patrick O&#8217;Brian, the film is a sea-set adventure about a British warship in pursuit of a French counterpart through dangerous seas, threats of mutiny, and the harsh pain of time. Russell Crowe plays the British captain and gives a fantastic performance as a man who presses his crew at risk of both his limits and theirs, and the battle sequences are stellar displays of old-school glory.</p>\n<p>Remember that time Darren Aronofsky delivered a $360 million box-office haul with a religious epic? <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/noah-review-darren-aronofsky-goes-big-and-bleak-c664cc29e74f/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><em>Noah</em></strong></a> (2014) premieres on April 9th and casts Crowe as the titular bible character who, on instructions from God, builds an enormous ark, rounds up a ton of animals, and faces off against asshole mobs and apocalyptic weather. It&#8217;s a big, thrilling epic despite hewing close enough to the source material to be considered a respectful adaptation, and it succeeds as large entertainment. Sure, some independent thinker chaos would have been appreciated, but it should appeal to fans of Crowe, big disaster cinema, and bible stories.</p>\n<p>Crowe&#8217;s most recent feature hasn&#8217;t quite gotten a fair shake, so allow me to step up to defend <strong><em>Unhinged</em></strong> (2020). Yes, the protagonist is a dumb bag of rocks &#8212; how&#8217;s that for the start of my defense?! &#8212; but everything else is good stuff for genre fans. Crowe plays a guy having a really bad day, week, month, and life, and when a young woman gives him grief during the morning commute he targets her for a deadly lesson. This is a mean-spirited thriller with a surprisingly high body count, and the car action/stunts are pretty great as they deliver lots of metal-crunching practical effects. Crowe is an absolute monster and legitimately terrifying as the embodiment of the &#8220;angry white male,&#8221; but while it can be that simple if you want it the film also delivers a strong lesson in empathy &#8212; you never know how another person is suffering, so maybe just be nice?</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Westerns!</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-364604\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/open-range-costner-duvall-800x515.jpg\" alt=\"Open Range Costner Duvall\" width=\"800\" height=\"515\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/open-range-costner-duvall-800x515.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/open-range-costner-duvall-1090x702.jpg 1090w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/open-range-costner-duvall-768x494.jpg 768w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/open-range-costner-duvall.jpg 1100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p>The 60s and 70s are filled with films whose ratings would probably surprise you, and <strong><em>Chato&#8217;s Land</em></strong> (1972) is among them. This PG-rated Western is filled with some foul antics en route to a thrilling adventure about a mixed-race Native American (Charles Bronson) targeted by a posse for killing a man in self-defense. Bronson is leathery brilliance, and director Michael Winner keeps the action, suspense, and scenery flowing. The supporting cast includes Jack Palance, Richard Jordan, and James Whitmore, and it&#8217;s a fantastic film.</p>\n<p>Two movies opened within months of each other in the early 90s which shared a very similar focus, but while the Kevin Costner-led <em>Wyatt Earp</em> (1994) failed to find an audience, <strong><em>Tombstone</em></strong> (1993) has become a beloved Western classic. The cast alone is insane &#8212; Kurt Russell, Val Kilmer, Sam Elliott, Bill Paxton, Powers Boothe, Michael Biehn, Stephen Lang, and more &#8212; but director George P. Cosmatos backs it up with stylish, highly entertaining action and grand scope. It&#8217;s a banger in all the right ways, filled with quotable lines, and endlessly great on rewatch too.</p>\n<p>Costner may have lost that particular battle, but he returned a decade later to deliver one of the genre&#8217;s best with <strong><em>Open Range</em></strong> (2003). His third and final (as of now) directorial effort, the film is a gorgeous nod to classic Westerns as he and a terrific Robert Duvall find trouble in their attempt to herd cattle through disputed territory. Michael Gambon makes a wonderfully evil villain, Annette Bening crafts a character who&#8217;s more than mere window dressing, and Costner shoots the hell out of the American landscape &#8212; and action scenes. The violence here is brutally effective, but it never overshadows the character work as these men struggle with past sins and present predicaments. If you&#8217;ve missed this one so far, do yourself a favor and watch it now.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>New Amazon Originals</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-364607\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/without-remorse-movie-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"Without Remorse Movie\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/without-remorse-movie-800x533.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/without-remorse-movie-1090x726.jpg 1090w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/without-remorse-movie-768x512.jpg 768w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/without-remorse-movie.jpg 1100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p>Race and America&#8217;s disgraceful past (and present) have often been elements in genre fare up to and including the recent HBO series <em>Lovecraft Country</em>, and now Amazon is entering the fray with <strong><em>Them</em></strong> (premieres on April 9th). The show will follow one story per season involving terror within the American Dream, and first up is the story of a Black family who moves to Los Angeles from the South in the 50s in a search for something better only to find horror both human and otherwise awaiting them. Sounds like heavy stuff, but if it captures and channels real horrors in service of narrative thrills it could be something very special for genre fans.</p>\n<p>Amazon already has a successful <em>Jack Ryan</em> series with John Krasinski, and now they&#8217;re expanding their world with <strong><em>Tom Clancy&#8217;s Without Remorse</em></strong> (premieres April 30th). Granted, while they may not make the play for a crossover (although that would be a mistake) the film looks to have strong bones even as a standalone. Michael B. Jordan takes the lead in this Clancy adaptation for director Stefano Sollima (<em>Sicario: Day of the Soldado</em>, 2018) and co-writer Taylor Sheridan (<em>Sicario</em>, 2015) about a Navy SEAL on a mission of revenge. Yes, please, to all of this&#8230; and if it ends with Ryan asking him to join the Clancy initiative, all the better.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>The Complete Amazon Prime List for April 2021</h2>\n\n<table id=\"tablepress-58\" class=\"tablepress tablepress-id-58\">\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"row-1 odd\">\n\t<th class=\"column-1\">Release Date</th><th class=\"column-2\">Title</th><th class=\"column-3\">Note</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody class=\"row-hover\">\n<tr class=\"row-2 even\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\">4/1</td><td class=\"column-2\">The 6th Day (2001)</td><td class=\"column-3\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"row-3 odd\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\"></td><td class=\"column-2\">About a Boy (2002)</td><td class=\"column-3\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"row-4 even\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\"></td><td class=\"column-2\">The Abyss (1989)</td><td class=\"column-3\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"row-5 odd\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\"></td><td class=\"column-2\">Aloha (2015)</td><td class=\"column-3\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"row-6 even\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\"></td><td class=\"column-2\">American Pastoral (2016)</td><td class=\"column-3\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"row-7 odd\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\"></td><td class=\"column-2\">Anaconda (1997)</td><td class=\"column-3\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"row-8 even\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\"></td><td class=\"column-2\">Anna Karenina (2012)</td><td class=\"column-3\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"row-9 odd\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\"></td><td class=\"column-2\">Art of Falling in Love (2019)</td><td class=\"column-3\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"row-10 even\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\"></td><td class=\"column-2\">Because I Said So (2007)</td><td class=\"column-3\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"row-11 odd\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\"></td><td class=\"column-2\">Bob Roberts (1992)</td><td class=\"column-3\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"row-12 even\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\"></td><td class=\"column-2\">The Bone Collector (1999)</td><td class=\"column-3\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"row-13 odd\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\"></td><td class=\"column-2\">Brüno (2009)</td><td class=\"column-3\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"row-14 even\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\"></td><td class=\"column-2\">Captain Kronos: Vampire Hunter (1974)</td><td class=\"column-3\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"row-15 odd\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\"></td><td class=\"column-2\">Chato's Land (1972)</td><td class=\"column-3\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"row-16 even\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\"></td><td class=\"column-2\">Cheech &#38; Chong's Still Smokin' (1983)</td><td class=\"column-3\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"row-17 odd\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\"></td><td class=\"column-2\">Cohen And Tate (1989)</td><td class=\"column-3\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"row-18 even\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\"></td><td class=\"column-2\">Daddy's Little Girls (2007)</td><td class=\"column-3\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"row-19 odd\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\"></td><td class=\"column-2\">The Dead Zone (1983)</td><td class=\"column-3\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"row-20 even\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\"></td><td class=\"column-2\">Dear John (2010)</td><td class=\"column-3\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"row-21 odd\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\"></td><td class=\"column-2\">Devil In A Blue Dress (1995)</td><td class=\"column-3\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"row-22 even\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\"></td><td class=\"column-2\">The Devil's Double (2011)</td><td class=\"column-3\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"row-23 odd\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\"></td><td class=\"column-2\">Did You Hear About The Morgans?

Best Final Shots in Movie History</strong>, presented by the team behind <a href=\"http://twitter.com/oneperfectshot\">One Perfect Shot</a>. It could go without saying, but we&#8217;ll say it anyway: this list includes spoilers for at least 75 movies. Please be sure that you&#8217;re ready for that before scrolling any further.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Anyone in storytelling will tell you that a good ending is hard-won. That beginning a film, building up a world and getting to know its characters, is one thing, but that figuring out how to leave them is another. When the lights come up, and eyes adjust, how do you want your audience to leave the theatre? Elated? Resolute? Horrified? In tears? Changed?</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">You’ll need a good ending and, if you’re a real pro, a good final shot. It’s the last thing the audience will see before the credits roll and, done well, the image that will follow them home. You know what they say about last impressions.<br />\n</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Some closing shots provide unexpected answers to big questions. Others let questions dangle endlessly; leaving it to the audience to decide for themselves how the film closed out. Some provide resolve. Others double down on tragedy. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Below we’ve assembled the seventy-five best, ranked. Enjoy.</span></p>\n<hr />\n<h2>75.

No one believes anything without proof. Well, here’s your goddamn proof. The camera pulls away from the island, flying further and further across the sea. Will her raft make it across such unforgiving terrain? Does it matter? Jen has lit the island forest ablaze. Surely, that’s a large enough spotlight for some passing plane to catch. Jenn will return, and <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/jd-dillard-fantastic-fest-interview/\">her tale of monsters</a> will be told.</p>\n<h4>The Talent Behind It</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Directed by J.D.

It is, like much of <i>Beasts</i>, a slice of visual poetry: in the haze of a storm, a weathered community walks together in procession down a highway, waves lapping at their feet.

She’s just witnessed an incredible turn of events. The king is dead, killed by a not-so-loyal commander, who is currently fabricating a complex web of lies to the officials on the other side. Only she knows the truth. So, why does she pause? <em>Shadow</em> falls and rests on Sun Li’s micro performance. In the span of seconds, we see glee, terror, and confusion. Having experienced an epic torment, we know what we want her to do, but is she the one to fulfill our needs? Our needs are not her needs. When the film cuts to black, it’s a gasp. We’ll never know. We make up our own lies to eradicate curiosity.</p>\n<h4>The Talent Behind It</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Directed by Yimou Zhang</li>\n<li>Cinematography by Xiaoding Zhao</li>\n<li>Costume Design by Minzheng Chen</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>The Stinger</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVF7fL2KMhY&#38;list=PLkLimRXN6NKxngh5N53Oq-JqHffQo73yO&#38;index=19\">“Bloodstains on Embroidered Silk” by Lao Zai</a></p>\n<hr />\n<h2 class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">72.

The lawn which previously housed the crumpled corpse of Michael Myers is now terrifyingly empty. And in a flourish of calculated anticipation, John Carpenter rolls out a montage of suburbia scored by the predatory wheeze of Michael’s breaths. We finally arrive at a dark, abandoned house, and the camera lingers.

Look, back in 2000 you only had so many DVDs. With Maximus’ story at a close, a freed Juba (Djimon Hounsou) returns to the Roman Coliseum to bury effigies of Maximus’ wife and son on the spot where he died. Juba promises he’ll see his friend again someday, and the camera pans up. Before us stretches Rome, the early sun, and unworldly rosy clouds; a warmth and beauty denied us for much of the film.</span></p>\n<h4>The Talent Behind It</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Directed by Ridley Scott</li>\n<li>Cinematography by John Mathieson</li>\n<li>Visual Effects Supervised by John Nelson</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s1\">The Stinger</span></h4>\n<p class=\"p7\"><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/track/0DENhwLXDNvKf9g1oe85Ue?si=xjjZo5fiTRKOBAe-tB6jBA\"><span class=\"s1\">“Now We Are Free” by Lisa Gerrard, Hanz Zimmer, and others</span></a></p>\n<hr />\n<p><a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/best-final-shots/2/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-327548 size-full\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/next-page.jpg\" alt=\"Next Page\" width=\"364\" height=\"99\" /></a></p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/k8GIL32O190\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 06 Apr 2021 00:00:17 +0000","feedId":24,"bgimg":"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/final-shots-sweetheart.jpg","linkMd5":"9b439204f3e171d3a08b245c3848d65a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn4@2020_5/2021/04/07/17-38-16-793_7de2312e16ae052f.webp","destWidth":1100,"destHeight":457,"sourceBytes":14791,"destBytes":9654,"author":"One Perfect Shot","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/final-shots-sweetheart.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn4@2020_5/2021/04/07/17-38-16-793_7de2312e16ae052f.webp","https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/beasts-of-the-southern-wild-final-shot.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn33@2020_1/2021/04/07/17-38-17-821_e2c3ac803c6d002d.webp","https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/final-shots-shadow.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn28@2020_6/2021/04/07/17-38-17-663_e36c82267dc69c35.webp","https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/halloween-final-shot.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn29@2020_5/2021/04/07/17-38-17-753_b0bc1290d8ac9e0c.webp","https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/gladiator-final-shot-1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn14@2020_2/2021/04/07/17-38-17-496_555f0ec72b21e74f.webp","https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/next-page.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn16@2020_2/2021/04/07/17-38-17-418_49e2bcbad1f2f459.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/k8GIL32O190":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn32@2020_2/2021/04/07/17-38-17-589_09d9d82a0c82c6e5.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617817096437},{"createdTime":"2021-04-08 01:38:16","updatedTime":"2021-04-08 01:38:16","title":"The Haunting Power of the Victorian Mansion","link":"https://filmschoolrejects.com/?p=364500","description":"<p><em>Welcome to <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/topics/the-queue/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>The Queue</strong></a> — your daily distraction of curated video content sourced from across the web.

The Victorian mansion is the property of choice when it comes to the horror genre. It was the cozy home of America&#8217;s preeminent weirdos, <strong>the Addams&#8217; family</strong>. It&#8217;s where <strong><em>Psycho</em></strong>&#8216;s Norman Bates hid his dark, motherly secrets. And you can&#8217;t throw a rock at a collection of gothic pulp novels without hitting a piece of cover art featuring a big, ole menacing Victorian estate.</p>\n<p>So, how did the Victorian mansion become a symbol of death and an icon of the horror genre? You&#8217;d be forgiven for assuming it all boiled down to innate ooky spookiness. But, like many of the great cinematic nightmares, the basis of this macabre manor&#8217;s ghastly reputation has a historical precedent. Namely: as a decaying relic of a grotesque, gilded age; an immediate symbol of decay and rotten excess.</p>\n<p>The video essay below digs deeper into the specifics of how the Victorian mansion earned its spot in the pop-culture consciousness. So pass through the rusted iron gates and knock (that is&#8230;click!) if you dare:</p>\n<p>Watch &#8220;<strong>Why the Victorian mansion is a horror icon</strong>&#8220;:</p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Why the Victorian mansion is a horror icon\" width=\"700\" height=\"394\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2xvNhN1PsRw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<h2>Who made this?</h2>\n<p>This video is by <em><strong>Vox</strong></em>, an American news website owned by <strong>Vox Media</strong>, founded in 2014.

You&#8217;ve likely seen examples of each and simply need to connect the dots to bring the definitions into focus.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a greater chance you&#8217;ve heard of &#8220;<strong>hard science fiction</strong>,&#8221; which describes a category within the genre chiefly concerned with logic, rules, and scientific accuracy. Think: the eugenics in <strong><em>Gattaca</em></strong>, the potato-growing in <strong><em>The Martian</em></strong>, or the way time accelerates in <strong><em>Interstellar</em></strong>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;<strong>Soft science fiction</strong>,&#8221; on the other hand, cares less about plausibility and more about engaging viewers through character, culture, and relationships. <strong><em>Frankenstein</em></strong>, for instance, is less interested in the specificities of re-animation than the consequences of violating the natural order of things.</p>\n<p>This is, effectively, also the difference between hard worldbuilding and soft worldbuilding. The former crafts immersion through concrete, consistent rules. The latter operates independently of logic, with flexibility and fantasy. It is, as the video essay below explains, a difference between explicit and imagined depth. And neither approach is better or worse than the other, merely different.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1.14285rem;\">Watch &#8220;<strong>Hard Worldbuilding vs. Soft Worldbuilding | A Study of Studio Ghibli</strong></span><span style=\"font-size: 1.14285rem;\">&#8220;:</span></p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Hard Worldbuilding vs. Soft Worldbuilding | A Study of Studio Ghibli\" width=\"700\" height=\"394\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gcyrrTud3x4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<h2>Who made this?</h2>\n<p id=\"block-839c096a-2881-4e76-aef1-4e01b79aa34f\">This video essay is by <strong>Tim Hickson</strong>, the New Zealand-based creator of  <strong>Hello Future Me</strong>.

This entry revisits the pilot episode (&#8220;Natural Selection&#8221;) of BBC America&#8217;s award-winning sci-fi series Orphan Black.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>You’re at a train station. It’s late. You’re almost out of money, and the last train of the night is moments away. After scrounging up some coins to make a call, you turn around and see them: someone who looks just like you. They’re dressed differently, and they seem upset. Then, before you know what’s happening, they jump in front of an oncoming train.</p>\n<p>It’s a scene that’s at once frighteningly unimaginable and classically familiar. The setup would be right at home in an Alfred Hitchcock film or an episode of <em>The Twilight Zone</em>. Instead, it’s the opening scene of <strong><em>Orphan Black</em></strong>, the rip-roaring sci-fi thriller that ran for five seasons on BBC America, winning an Emmy and a Peabody and racking up dozens of other accolades. Conspiratorial, action-packed, and deftly interwoven with crucial exposition, the show has a hit right off the bat with its <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/best-tv-pilots-of-the-21st-century/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">pilot episode</a>, “<strong>Natural Selection</strong>.”</p>\n<p>When faced with the uncanny situation above, most people would surely crack from fear and pressure. Sarah Manning (<strong>Tatiana Maslany</strong>) is not like most people. Before the title sequence has even made its first appearance, She has taken advantage of a gruesome situation, stealing her deceased doppelganger’s bag and all its contents. The leather-clad, disheveled young woman soon makes a beeline for her favorite bar.</p>\n<p>The episode is written by series co-creator <strong>Graeme Manson</strong>, and the nimble script effortlessly drops in bits of complicated backstory without sacrificing any of its sleekness or charm. Sarah soon meets up with Felix (<strong>Jordan Gavaris</strong>, a series standout), her foster brother with impeccable makeup and an even better sense of wit. “How’s Vic the dick?” he asks her. “I hit him first this time&#8230;with an ashtray, so he’s a little blue,”</p>\n<p>Sarah answers. We soon learn that she is on the run from her abusive boyfriend, hoping to flip some coke she stole from him so she can afford to take her daughter Kira (<strong>Skyler Wexler</strong>) back from her own foster mother, Mrs. S. (<strong>Maria Doyle Kennedy</strong>). She also tells Felix about the woman, whom they identify as Beth Childs. The suicide of a posh stranger who may have been Sarah’s long-lost twin is only of passing interest for the pair, who have other threats to worry about.</p>\n<p>“Natural Selection” gives viewers a taste of the electric, mood-mimicking camerawork and lighting that will become episode director and <em>Orphan Black</em> co-creator <strong>John Fawcett</strong>’s signature. Meanwhile, episode editor <strong>Brett Sullivan </strong>(who previously worked with Fawcett on the film <em>Ginger Snaps</em>), imbues the series opener with a markedly high sense of energy thanks to quick cuts that mimic the plot’s fast-moving, conspiratorial energy.</p>\n<p>The best use of their craft comes during a satisfying montage sequence about twelve minutes in. When Sarah and Felix find out that Beth had $75,000 in a brand new bank account, they decide to pull a con. In a thrilling sequence, Sarah becomes Beth. She watches home videos of the dead woman, again and again, masking her own East London accent and taking on Beth’s more formal Canadian cadence. She practices Beth’s signature, raids Beth’s closet, dyes her hair, and scratches the magnetic strip off her debit card.</p>\n<p>Finally, as M.I.A.’s “Bad Girls” plays, she struts into the bank in full rich bitch attire in a moment of true transformation. It’s the first of a dozen different entertaining magic tricks <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/orphan-black/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Maslany pulls off</a> throughout the series while playing several characters, many of whom are often disguised as other, identical characters.</p>\n<p>Across the series’ five seasons, Sarah stays at the heart of <em>Orphan Black</em>, proving herself a scrappy survivor who’s willing to take big risks for a big payoff. She also clearly considers herself a bit of a failure: a mother who isn’t able to keep her daughter; a woman who isn’t able to escape her abusive ex. The seeds of this characterization are planted in this episode, which sees Sarah use reckless ingenuity to adapt to every twist and turn.</p>\n<p>When she finds out she can get Beth’s money, she doesn’t hesitate to fake her own death, making Felix ID Beth so she can assume the dead woman’s identity for as long as it takes to steal from her. When she finds out that Beth is a cop set to testify at an internal affairs investigation, she asks for a bathroom break and chugs hand soap to make herself throw up in the middle of the interview. When Beth’s boyfriend Paul (<strong>Dylan Bruce</strong>) returns early from a business trip and catches on to her personality changes &#8212; Sarah is pretty rock and roll, while Beth was seemingly depressed &#8212; she goes with the flow and has sex with him on Beth’s pristine kitchen island to distract him.</p>\n<p>The first episode &#8212; and indeed, the whole first season &#8212; manages to successfully masquerade as a comedy of manners when it’s not wearing a half-dozen other narrative hats.</p>\n<p>The entire first season of <em>Orphan Black</em> is unparalleled in its mix of adrenaline, cleverness, and surprising sci-fi revelations. Upon rewatch, it’s striking that the pilot episode manages to be so excellent while not yet including several of the show’s signature characters &#8212; among them, funky lesbian scientist Cosima, pill-popping housewife Alison, and unhinged Ukrainian assassin Helena, all of whom are played by Maslany.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Natural Selection&#8221; does the work of sewing seeds for the overarching plot of <em>Orphan Black</em>, which involves genetic cloning by shady corporations, but it fascinatingly chooses to remain a down-and-dirty crime thriller first and foremost. Sarah and Felix are too distracted by the promise of quick cash and a French exit to pay much attention to the stack of international birth certificates they find in Beth’s safe deposit box or the shady situation that led to Beth’s demise.</p>\n<p>The first hint of the series&#8217; clone plot comes in the episode’s pulse-pounding last few minutes, which involve even more quick changes than the rest of the hour. Comically over-the-top thug Vic (<strong>Michael Mando</strong>) has caught up to Felix, who has no choice but to put together a fake funeral for Sarah to throw him off the scent of their scheme. Sarah decides to watch her memorial from afar, peeking through binoculars from a parked car and phoning Felix to talk shit about the attendees. “It was always fight-or-flight with her,” Vic says emotionally, calling to mind the scientific principle that gives the episode its title.</p>\n<p>Suddenly, things take a turn. Mrs. S and Kira, neither of whom Sarah has clued into her scheme yet, make an appearance at the funeral. “She can’t think I’m dead,” Sarah cries, losing the composure that’s kept her safe until this point. It’s a brief moment, but one that hints at Maslany’s ability to deliver a powerhouse emotional performance. A mother’s love will remain a constant throughline in the series, and we see it here for the first time when all the shenanigans fall away.</p>\n<p>All of this would be more than enough to write into a pilot and call it a day, but <em>Orphan Black</em> wouldn’t be the propulsive series it is if it didn’t always turn the dial to eleven. Mid-freakout, a German woman who also looks just like Sarah hops into the backseat of her car. She’s got short red hair, a stylish fur vest, and a mean cough that leaves drops of blood in her tissue. Her name’s Katja Obinger, and she knew Beth. “Just one, I&#8217;m a few, no family, too. Who am I?” she riddles, a security question of sorts. When Sarah fails to answer, Katja clocks her. For a moment, it seems the ruse is up, but then a single gunshot, from a distance, tears through Katja’s skull.</p>\n<p>The first episode ends on an adrenalized high note, with Sarah making a frantic escape from the mystery sniper. She drives Beth’s car while ducked below the dashboard as more shots ring out, ignoring the cell phone lighting up on the seat beside her. <em>Orphan Black</em> would go on to bring viewers forty-nine more episodes that explore themes like human autonomy, bioethics, fate, and the slipperiness of defining personhood. The series evolves from a Hitchcockian conspiracy thriller into a complex science fiction saga, and it has plenty of watershed installments along the way.</p>\n<p>Despite all that, none of the episodes that follow &#8220;Natural Selection&#8221; are as singularly thrilling and propulsive as the gritty and stylish series opener, which establishes <em>Orphan Black</em> as can’t-miss television from its first moment to its last.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Orphan Black is available to stream </em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Orphan-Black-Season-1/dp/B00BVYLBP2\" target=\"_blank\"
