This genealogy includes magazines that are for the general reader, but that dare to posit a general reader who wants to be challenged, who has political commitments but is not looking for ideological marching orders, who is seeking new forms and new ideas, who wants to see received wisdom skeptically scrutinized, not soothingly affirmed—and anyone who regularly reads n+1’s “Intellectual Situation” essays can attest that there is very little soothing affirmation to be found there. If, as Benedict Anderson suggested, newspapers can create nations, then certainly magazines can shape a public sphere. It is so, so important to support magazines and media that help sustain the kind of public sphere in which in which totalitarian assaults on language, fact, and thought can be resisted.","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Mon, 28 Oct 2019 16:23:33 +0000","feedId":10021,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"aad2f55045a83ba5b138f528c2d830a5","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Elizabeth Schambelan","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598316131281},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:42:11","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:42:11","title":"How Russia Learned to Start Worrying","link":"https://nplusonemag.com/?post_type=article&p=12469","description":"<img src=\"https://nplusonemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/IMG_3051.jpg\"><br>The news was not “fake,” but the measures were hardly enforced.

Finley’s idea that the damage to the bar was a secondary result of violence Harriet and Ariel had inflicted upon each other was plainly false; the nature of the damage made it clear that the violence was directed at the bar itself. Finley must have realized this as well, because he refined his theory in successive tellings such that Ariel alone was responsible for the damage, which she’d exacted in a fit of jealous rage as Harriet stood by helpless to intervene. But no one took this proposition seriously, either, because no one believed Finley could inspire jealous rage.","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 19:51:20 +0000","feedId":10021,"bgimg":"https://nplusonemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2249017849_d5bc83e2de_z.jpg","linkMd5":"feb8c7c441c6a2d135673eb5fb3f5b0e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn7@2020_3/2020/08/25/00-42-14-817_da6eabdf74a4b98b.webp","destWidth":640,"destHeight":440,"sourceBytes":70911,"destBytes":35608,"author":"Chris Knapp","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://nplusonemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2249017849_d5bc83e2de_z.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn7@2020_3/2020/08/25/00-42-14-817_da6eabdf74a4b98b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598316131280},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:42:11","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:42:11","title":"Job Announcement: Development Manager","link":"https://nplusonemag.com/?post_type=article&p=11935","description":"<img src=\"https://nplusonemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Caught-up-deal_Facebook.jpg\"><br>n+1 is looking for an experienced Development Manager to work full time in our Brooklyn office.

I had known about him for many years—since he first came to the Lakers. Among my earliest memories of shame comes from his first or second season: I thought that since his team-mate Shaquille O’Neill was clearly somehow Irish, Kobe, too, must be Irish, and so I referred to him (in front of friends, and friends’ parents) as Kobe O’Bryant.

I think one of the most devastating parts of this whole thing has been talking to people in prison while the marches and the rallies are happening and hearing the grief and the sorrow that people in prison feel for not being able to participate and be in the streets with their loved ones, with their friends and family members. And just remembering that prison is, yes, a system of racialized oppression, yes, a system of warehousing and killing people—and also a way of squashing political organizing. It’s a way of locking people up, and keeping people away from each other, and not giving people access to each other so they can organize, so they can build a movement together.","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 19 Aug 2020 17:25:10 +0000","feedId":10021,"bgimg":"https://nplusonemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-19-at-1.03.24-PM.png","linkMd5":"3b74e476a41f4c86e110d389896139c3","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn83@2020_1/2020/08/25/00-42-17-553_486bf7666c952e3f.webp","destWidth":1215,"destHeight":920,"sourceBytes":1710297,"destBytes":127070,"author":"Anthony Dixon, Michelle Lewin, Sarah Resnick, Jose Saldana","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://nplusonemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-19-at-1.03.24-PM.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn83@2020_1/2020/08/25/00-42-17-553_486bf7666c952e3f.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598316131269},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:42:11","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:42:11","title":"Issue 36 Reading Party at the Verso Loft","link":"https://nplusonemag.com/?post_type=article&p=11968","description":"<img src=\"https://nplusonemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Issue36ReadingFlyer.jpg\"><br>A night of drinks and readings from our latest issue.","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 09 Jan 2020 20:27:42 +0000","feedId":10021,"bgimg":"https://nplusonemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Issue36ReadingFlyer.jpg","linkMd5":"c7fa44f2d5af15889d6cec45de245f79","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn16@2020_4/2020/08/25/00-42-19-339_9fc19cbe8257820f.webp","destWidth":1000,"destHeight":1348,"sourceBytes":487985,"destBytes":53944,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://nplusonemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Issue36ReadingFlyer.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn16@2020_4/2020/08/25/00-42-19-339_9fc19cbe8257820f.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598316131279},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:42:11","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:42:11","title":"Issue 35 Reading Party at the Verso Loft","link":"https://nplusonemag.com/?post_type=article&p=11726","description":"<img src=\"https://nplusonemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Issue35_NoMaggie.png\"><br>A night of drinks and readings from our latest issue.","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Mon, 30 Sep 2019 18:54:01 +0000","feedId":10021,"bgimg":"https://nplusonemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Issue35_NoMaggie.png","linkMd5":"e6f695a438182097b1ac4b298d729151","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn95@2020_2/2020/08/25/00-42-12-721_b80b6280d6a2eae6.webp","destWidth":1000,"destHeight":1348,"sourceBytes":233052,"destBytes":45572,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://nplusonemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Issue35_NoMaggie.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn95@2020_2/2020/08/25/00-42-12-721_b80b6280d6a2eae6.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598316131281},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:42:11","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:42:11","title":"My Marine Counterpart","link":"https://nplusonemag.com/?post_type=article&p=11605","description":"<img src=\"https://nplusonemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/unnamed.jpg\"><br>I.

It is indicative of a dangerous lack of imagination if the best we can do is make a tacit admission that it was unwise to give the police more resources in the years after the rise of Black Lives Matter.","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 23 Jun 2020 21:36:55 +0000","feedId":10021,"bgimg":"https://nplusonemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Altman_BarclaysFist.jpg","linkMd5":"5bd4d44b62a263c3a09f9ae5a3b6c997","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn76@2020_3/2020/08/25/00-42-11-877_1c5619ba9cf6cd26.webp","destWidth":1069,"destHeight":1591,"sourceBytes":805297,"destBytes":309150,"author":"Blair McClendon","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://nplusonemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Altman_BarclaysFist.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn76@2020_3/2020/08/25/00-42-11-877_1c5619ba9cf6cd26.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598316131270},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:42:11","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:42:11","title":"Right Effort","link":"https://nplusonemag.com/?post_type=article&p=11646","description":"There are only so many hours in the day and days in the year, and we must carefully distribute them between work, sleep, activism, and “other” — where much of the pleasure of life is relegated.","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 24 Sep 2019 16:47:20 +0000","feedId":10021,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"3b5746d3afbac77de888707d977b1f92","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"The Editors","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598316131282},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:42:11","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:42:11","title":"Spectacle of Participation","link":"https://nplusonemag.com/?post_type=article&p=11647","description":"<img src=\"https://nplusonemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/EGYiHVQWoAABN-H.jpeg\"><br>Endless campaigns may be seen as evidence of a candidate’s eventual priorities.

The new professionals were in general politically progressive, seeing their purpose as the renovation of American democracy and the modernization of conditions of work and life, in keeping with the momentous social and technological changes that had remade the world. Early on, they tended to imagine themselves as the antagonists of capitalists, not workers—or at least as brokers between the two. Social control, the production of rationalized plebeian behavior, was necessary for democracy to function, and might even gradually transform into socialism—the apotheosis of the principle of social rationality.","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 10 Oct 2019 19:37:22 +0000","feedId":10021,"bgimg":"https://nplusonemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-10-at-3.20.17-PM.png","linkMd5":"f706725687ee0d04074a64698db4abfd","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn32@2020_5/2020/08/25/00-42-13-544_a06298a94da1587e.webp","destWidth":2181,"destHeight":982,"sourceBytes":1342589,"destBytes":52640,"author":"Gabriel Winant","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://nplusonemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-10-at-3.20.17-PM.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn32@2020_5/2020/08/25/00-42-13-544_a06298a94da1587e.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598316131281},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:42:11","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:42:11","title":"Pollito, Chicken; Gallina, Hen","link":"https://nplusonemag.com/?post_type=article&p=12299","description":"<img src=\"https://nplusonemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/chickens.jpg\"><br>Notice how the register of the prose, with its figures and rates, evokes the rhetoric of nonfiction.

Of course the language has stopped growing: where are we even supposed to talk to each other now?","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Mon, 09 Dec 2019 17:22:09 +0000","feedId":10021,"bgimg":"https://nplusonemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_20191203_071301.jpg","linkMd5":"63672758573d0419ac0a98421a07d570","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn3@2020_4/2020/08/25/00-42-15-367_f68b68767c7f9d9a.webp","destWidth":1844,"destHeight":922,"sourceBytes":453539,"destBytes":155112,"author":"Omar Robert Hamilton","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://nplusonemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_20191203_071301.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn3@2020_4/2020/08/25/00-42-15-367_f68b68767c7f9d9a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598316131280},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:42:11","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:42:11","title":"We Had a Shakespeare","link":"https://nplusonemag.com/?post_type=article&p=12065","description":"<img src=\"https://nplusonemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/RodriquesWeeks_Shimoyama-web.jpg\"><br>But people do such horrifying things in the name of love and in such violent contexts in her novels. <em>The Bluest Eye</em> is the source of the quote that’s been circulating since she passed: “Love is never any better than the lover.” In a novel in which intimate partner violence and child abuse take center stage, it’s hard not to read this sentence as a claim about love’s uselessness.

Hauntology was not just nostalgia, the idea that the past was better and that we’d like to return to it. The most famous practitioner of hauntology in music, Burial, produced loving memorials to British rave music of the early ’90s based not on his own memories—he was too young to go to the raves—but on stories told to him by his older brother. Rave culture promised a future that Burial should have inhabited as an adult, but that future never arrived, and that sense of the past failing to keep its promises to those who came after is what made hauntology such a fruitful project for those born to the wealthiest generation in world history.","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 10 Jul 2020 17:30:26 +0000","feedId":10021,"bgimg":"https://nplusonemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/airpods.jpg","linkMd5":"1fe7eecdff1cbd98f69722a89a465bf0","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn28@2020_4/2020/08/25/00-42-13-685_5abe997af546068c.webp","destWidth":2826,"destHeight":1589,"sourceBytes":1384987,"destBytes":40256,"author":"Richard Beck","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://nplusonemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/airpods.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn28@2020_4/2020/08/25/00-42-13-685_5abe997af546068c.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598316131270},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:42:11","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:42:11","title":"Announcing Issue 37","link":"https://nplusonemag.com/?post_type=article&p=12635","description":"<img src=\"https://nplusonemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/I37_TOC-announcement.jpg\"><br>Writing by Marco Roth, Nausicaa Renner, Rachel Ossip, Sarah Resnick, Namara Smith, Richard Beck, Gabriel Winant, Judith Levine and Erica R.

You can tell when a country song is just simple—when the necessary effort hasn’t been made—and you can tell when a songwriter hasn’t pulled off the compression, because then the song sounds mannered. But when both elements are working, a country song can shimmer, throb, or glare at you with an uncomfortable intensity.","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 16 Aug 2019 15:13:09 +0000","feedId":10021,"bgimg":"https://nplusonemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/dc198ph06-1.jpg","linkMd5":"914e65995b65d8a080f54b0fa0af855b","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn3@2020_5/2020/08/25/00-42-12-542_5be1771ceb92dedf.webp","destWidth":1877,"destHeight":1500,"sourceBytes":424631,"destBytes":212328,"author":"Richard Beck","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://nplusonemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/dc198ph06-1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn3@2020_5/2020/08/25/00-42-12-542_5be1771ceb92dedf.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598316131283},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:42:11","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:42:11","title":"Out Here","link":"https://nplusonemag.com/?post_type=article&p=12662","description":"<img src=\"https://nplusonemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ATL-Nicole-Buchanan-06_02_2020-29.jpg\"><br>Every way we’re photographing Black men, and women, and children, whoever, needs to be humanizing.
