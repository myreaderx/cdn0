If you can make it in New York, you can make it anywhere, says Frank Sinatra, and winning the Big Apple plays a massive role in determining which operators will survive as the rideshare industry consolidates under a few powerful players. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bird is already in over 100 cities around the United States, Europe and the Middle East, while Lime is ubiquitous, with around 130 cities in the U.S., Europe, the Middle East and Australia under its belt. This win calcifies the clout the two already have in the industry. Chicago-based VeoRide is arguably the underdog of the trio, with service in around 20 U.S. cities, so getting the chance to operate in New York could be a game-changer for the </span><a href=\"https://veo-mobility.medium.com/sorry-boys-the-first-profitable-micromobility-company-was-veo-not-lime-97b6b279243f\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">already profitable</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> company.

Superpedestrian CEO Assaf Biderman said in a statement that the company was proud of the proposal it presented. &#8220;We know this is just a beginning, and there are more communities in every corner of the city that are calling out for new, safe and sustainable transportation options&#8211;something we can deliver,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite general fanfare, there may be a limit to how far operations can spread beyond the Bronx in the future. The first phase of the pilot covers neighborhoods in the East Bronx spanning from Eastchester to Van Nest; the second phase extends south to Soundview and east to Edgewater with another 4,000 to 6,000 scooters. The DOT said it chose these geographic boundaries to reach transit deserts that are unserved by existing bike-share programs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That last bit is important to note. Lyft-owned Citi Bike has a monopoly over shared micromobility in NYC, with bike docks all over Manhattan and in parts of Brooklyn, Queens and the South Bronx. While </span><a href=\"https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=3763648&#38;GUID=05DFE6C0-4E1E-4E49-A95C-BDD1F9C44555&#38;Options=ID%7CText%7C&#38;Search=1266\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2018 legislation that allowed for the introduction of dockless e-scooters in NYC</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> aims to “prioritize” neighborhoods with no access to Citi Bike, the pilot zones were designed specifically to avoid overlap with Bronx neighborhoods targeted by the docked bike share’s expansion plans. </span></p>\n<h2>What to expect from the e-scooter pilot in the Bronx</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aside from operating in alignment with NYC’s Vision Zero and equity goals, the DOT chose companies that would play ball with the city’s strong enforcement mechanisms, and that very much includes managing sidewalk clutter with dedicated parking corrals and fleet management software, a DOT spokesperson told TechCrunch. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lime intends to combine its corral and lock-to parking strategies for the first time in NYC to ensure its Gen 3 and Gen 4 scooters don’t become a bother to the community. It’ll also rely on its backend fleet management software and a “tidy crew” that will patrol the pilot area to rebalance scooters. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“At high-traffic locations like transit stations, riders must park in physical parking corrals enforced using Lime’s industry-leading geofence technology,” Phil Jones, Lime’s senior government relations director told TechCrunch. Lime uses a combination of onboard and cloud computing to determine the locations of geofences, so it’ll be interesting to see how this tech holds up in such a dense city, where even Google Maps often has trouble placing individuals. “Using our LimeLocks, riders must lock their e-scooters at bike racks or other places where traditional bike parking is permitted.”</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://veo-mobility.medium.com/getting-scooters-right-for-new-yorkers-541cad84de3d\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Veo also plans to implement lock-to parking</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to keep scooters from falling over or blocking sidewalks.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The pilot will cover an 18-square-mile area that’s home to 570,000 residents, 80% of whom are Black or Latino. The median household income in the Bronx is $40,088, with a poverty rate of 26.2%, according to the </span><a href=\"https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/bronxcountybronxboroughnewyork\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">U.S. Census Bureau</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, so equity was top of mind for the city when evaluating operators. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bird already has an Access program that offers unlimited rides for $5 a month to low-income residents who are on government assistance, and even allows riders to pay with cash and unlock vehicles via SMS.</span><b> </b><a href=\"https://www.veoride.com/veo-access/#:~:text=Veo%20Access,state%2C%20or%20federal%20assistance%20program.\">Veo has an access program, but the terms are unclear</a><b>. </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lime’s Access Program is similar, in that it offers 50% off rides to those on public assistance, but with NYC the program will see a rebrand as Lime Aid and expand to cover </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">frontline healthcare workers, teachers and people in the performing arts, nonprofit and hospitality sectors — those who have been most affected by the pandemic. Lime also has agreements with employment offices like BronxWorks and the Center for Employment Opportunities to source employees for the pilot locally.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">About 11% of Bronx residents under the age of 65 have a disability, so the DOT also evaluated operators based on accessibility. Victor Calise, commissioner of the mayor’s office for people with disabilities, was one of the people on the grading panel, so Lime made a point of focusing on accessibility for the disabled community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lime recently launched a program in San Francisco that allows people with disabilities to order an accessible scooter delivered to their house with 24-hours advance notice, and the company intends to try out the same service in New York. In preparation for the Bronx pilot, Lime designed and built seven vehicle types to meet various physical abilities, including a three-wheeled, sit-down vehicle for someone who has challenges balancing; a two-wheeled sit-down for someone who can’t stand for long periods of time; a tandem scooter of sorts so someone who has trouble seeing or is blind can have a partner with full vision with them; and a tricycle with a shopping basket. These vehicles are available on demand and will be delivered directly to users upon request. </span></p>\n<p>[gallery ids=\"2138246,2138250,2138242\"]</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We didn’t want to just think what </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">might</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a disabled person want, but to actually go to the New York disabled community and learn from them,” said Jones, noting that Lime worked with New York’s Center for Independence of the Disabled, as well as other advocacy groups, prior to submitting its bid. “There’s a vocal and vibrant community here, and we are not just addressing their concerns around parking on the street, but how they can actually use our devices so we can provide a meaningful service to them.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Veo will offer its stand-up Astro e-scooter and its futuristic-looking Cosmo seated e-scooter because seated rides are more accessible for many, especially those taking longer trips. The company has also stated that it’s committed to ADA compliance and will make available upon request electric-powered attachments that allow private non-motorized wheelchairs to operate as motorized devices.  </span></p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"usUQpkSpI2\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/maas-transit-the-business-of-mobility-as-a-service/\">MaaS transit: The business of mobility as a service</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;MaaS transit: The business of mobility as a service&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/maas-transit-the-business-of-mobility-as-a-service/embed/#?secret=usUQpkSpI2\" data-secret=\"usUQpkSpI2\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In terms of reducing traffic congestion and air pollution, Veo also touts its waterproof, durable, swappable batteries, which don’t require a gas-guzzling van to replace batteries but which can be done via cargo bike or even the Cosmo.

It is an issue that plagued Volkswagen&#8217;s launch of its all-electric VW ID.3, the 2022 Volvo XC40 Recharge and the Ford Mustang Mach-E. </span></p>\n<p>Apex.AI, a startup founded by Bosch veterans and automated systems engineers Jan Becker and Dejan Pangercic, has spent four years rewriting the robot operating system that will give automakers the tools to integrate software within the vehicle and make sure all the applications run reliably. Now, freshly armed with a safety certification that validates its software development kit (SDK) is sophisticated enough to be used in production vehicles, Apex.AI has landed Toyota and Japanese tech startup Tier IV as partners.</p>\n<p>Toyota&#8217;s Woven Planet Group is integrating the Apex.OS SDK into its own vehicle development platform, called Arene. The Apex SDK will handle the safety-critical applications and aims to speed up autonomous software development and ultimately bring it to production vehicles. In a separate deal announced Wednesday, <a href=\"https://tier4.jp/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://tier4.jp/en/&#38;source=gmail&#38;ust=1618356688676000&#38;usg=AFQjCNFXt4mZajNIXkusnbI_B5KZFKfzxg\">Tier IV,</a> a startup in Japan known as the original creator of open-source software for autonomous driving, called Autoware, said it will use Apex.AI&#8217;s software stack for safety-critical autonomous systems.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>&#8220;A trend that has become obvious in the past year, is in order to beat Tesla, car companies are aiming for what they call a software-defined vehicle,&#8221; Becker said in a recent interview. Automakers are moving away from distributing 100 electric control units (computers) throughout a vehicle and instead are having just a few high-performance computers with all the functions being implemented by the software, Becker explained.</p>\n<p>That shift might mean hundreds or even thousands of software developers might be working on one vehicle. &#8220;And that really only works if they are all using the same interface, and not in silos,&#8221; Becker said. &#8220;And this is exactly what this SDK now enables. So it&#8217;s the first time, with Apex.OS that there&#8217;s this common abstraction layer or SDK, which can address practically all functions in a vehicle.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Apex&#8217;s toolkit has attracted the attention of private and strategic investors. In 2018, the company raised a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/15/apex-ai-raises-15-5-million-for-autonomous-vehicle-software/\">Series A round of $15.5 million</a>. Since then, the company has taken <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/05/volvo-invests-in-autonomous-vehicle-operating-system-startup-apex-ai-though-its-vc-arm/\">strategic investment</a> from Airbus, JLR&#8217;s InMotion Ventures, Toyota and Volvo Group. Becker wouldn&#8217;t disclose the amounts of those investments, but noted the company is now raising for a Series B.</p>\n<p>The roots of Apex.OS are the open-source Robot Operating System known as ROS that is commonly used for R&#38;D projects and the development of autonomous vehicles. Apex&#8217;s aim was to rewrite the code to handle functional safety and real-time processing. The SDK was recently certified by TÜV NORD for functional safety. This means the technology is verified for use in production vehicles.</p>\n<p>It was a longstanding belief that open-source code was not certifiable, according to Becker. The company spent a year working on the certification.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If a software crash happens on your laptop it&#8217;s inconvenient, but if software crashes in any safety-critical function of a vehicle it can be catastrophic,&#8221; Becker said. &#8220;This is why we set out to write reliable software that protects against system crashes or operation failures. The certification proves we accomplished our goal as our software targets failure rates so low that they cannot be expressed statistically.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"MZKpkQkKcF\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/23/as-autonomy-stalls-lidar-companies-learn-to-adapt/\">As autonomy stalls, lidar companies learn to adapt</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;As autonomy stalls, lidar companies learn to adapt&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/23/as-autonomy-stalls-lidar-companies-learn-to-adapt/embed/#?secret=MZKpkQkKcF\" data-secret=\"MZKpkQkKcF\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=ef0e3r9C_IY:XLWrQQ4pCfI:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=ef0e3r9C_IY:XLWrQQ4pCfI:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=ef0e3r9C_IY:XLWrQQ4pCfI:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=ef0e3r9C_IY:XLWrQQ4pCfI:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=ef0e3r9C_IY:XLWrQQ4pCfI:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=ef0e3r9C_IY:XLWrQQ4pCfI:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=ef0e3r9C_IY:XLWrQQ4pCfI:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=ef0e3r9C_IY:XLWrQQ4pCfI:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/ef0e3r9C_IY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 14 Apr 2021 16:07:38 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"399a66862eedabb1a6aeb4024dae1bae","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn55@2020_4/2021/04/14/18-15-23-816_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Kirsten Korosec","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn55@2020_4/2021/04/14/18-15-23-816_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn84@2020_5/2021/04/14/18-15-31-225_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn59@2020_5/2021/04/14/18-15-30-860_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=ef0e3r9C_IY:XLWrQQ4pCfI:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn80@2020_2/2021/04/14/18-15-31-063_bd5e040060fd41f9.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=ef0e3r9C_IY:XLWrQQ4pCfI:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn92@2020_6/2021/04/14/18-15-31-253_ed6a0fccfb633dde.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn11@2020_2/2021/04/14/18-15-31-455_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/ef0e3r9C_IY":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn24@2020_3/2021/04/14/18-15-30-850_261fc542366fddc6.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618424109534},{"createdTime":"2021-04-15 02:15:09","updatedTime":"2021-04-15 02:15:09","title":"Inside the US’ epic first-quarter venture capital results","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2138308","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">It&#8217;s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/is-substack-really-worth-650m/\">no surprise</a> that the venture capital market was incredibly active in the United States during the first quarter of 2021, but precisely how strong has only recently become clear.

Especially in the case of seed data, which is famously laggy, added context is crucial. Let’s go!</p>\n<h2>A Q1 overview</h2>\n<p>According to PitchBook’s report, some 3,987 venture capital rounds were closed in the United States during Q1 2021. Those deals were worth $69 billion, a figure up nearly 93% from 2020’s first-quarter results.</p>\n<p>In broad strokes, the United States had a crushing venture capital start to the new year, pandemic be damned. That is especially true when we consider 2020’s full-year figures. Last year, venture capitalists deployed some $166 billion into U.S.-based startups across 12,546 rounds. In contrast, if the first quarter’s pace was maintained during the rest of 2021, the United States would see around 16,000 rounds worth around $280 billion.</p>\n<p>Of course, we cannot see the future, so those projections are merely shared to underscore how active the first quarter proved to be; we’ll have to wait for at least another quarter’s data to confidently predict full-year records for 2021.</p>\n<p>Powering the rapid start to the venture capital year was a holistic boom: Seed deal volume is forecasted to have set a multiyear high, perhaps matching the historically strong Q2 2018 period. Early-stage venture capital during Q1 2021 was also robust, with $14.5 billion deployed across 1,170 rounds. Both numbers set a pace for fresh records in 2021.</p>\n<p>Then there was late-stage dealmaking, which soared in the first quarter. In 2020, late-stage venture capital deals were worth $111.4 billion raised from 3,504 rounds. In the first quarter of 2021, some $51.9 billion was invested into late-stage startups across 1,291 deals.</p>\n<p>Valuations and round sizes continued to rise across the board. If there was a better time to raise a big whack of venture capital as a U.S.-based startup, we cannot recall it. And the data seems to scream that the good times are now as good, or gooder, than ever.<div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=HVL45cZNIjw:0ABJaOwJ_CM:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=HVL45cZNIjw:0ABJaOwJ_CM:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=HVL45cZNIjw:0ABJaOwJ_CM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=HVL45cZNIjw:0ABJaOwJ_CM:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=HVL45cZNIjw:0ABJaOwJ_CM:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=HVL45cZNIjw:0ABJaOwJ_CM:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=HVL45cZNIjw:0ABJaOwJ_CM:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=HVL45cZNIjw:0ABJaOwJ_CM:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/HVL45cZNIjw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 14 Apr 2021 15:39:35 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"73a3a31ff38a8d062c30b45a126b66e3","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn55@2020_4/2021/04/14/18-15-23-816_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Anna Heim","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn55@2020_4/2021/04/14/18-15-23-816_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn84@2020_5/2021/04/14/18-15-31-225_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn59@2020_5/2021/04/14/18-15-30-860_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=HVL45cZNIjw:0ABJaOwJ_CM:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn28@2020_4/2021/04/14/18-15-31-057_f2581ec77f616a94.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=HVL45cZNIjw:0ABJaOwJ_CM:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn39@2020_5/2021/04/14/18-15-30-878_1936dee7123e0bf3.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn11@2020_2/2021/04/14/18-15-31-455_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/HVL45cZNIjw":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn59@2020_1/2021/04/14/18-15-31-297_c9b7783fa1db16da.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618424109537},{"createdTime":"2021-04-15 02:15:09","updatedTime":"2021-04-15 02:15:09","title":"Google’s FeedBurner moves to a new infrastructure but loses its email subscription service","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2138519","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Google today <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2021/04/changes-to-feedburner?utm_source=feedburner&#38;utm_medium=feed&#38;utm_campaign=Feed%3A%20blogspot%2FamDG%20(Google%20Search%20Central%20Blog)\">announced</a> that it is moving FeedBurner to a new infrastructure but also deprecating its email subscription service.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re an internet user of a certain age, chances are you used Google&#8217;s <a href=\"https://feedburner.google.com/\">FeedBurner</a> to manage the RSS feeds of your personal blogs and early podcasts at some point.

You should have all the mobile apps downloaded so that, in minutes, you can actually see your full financial life. And keep it simple. Fewer accounts are better. I always tell people, if you have seven credit cards, plus three savings accounts, that&#8217;s a lot. You&#8217;re never going to be as good at managing your finances. Simplify your accounts. <em><strong>(Time stamp — 2:50)</strong></em></p></blockquote>\n<hr />\n<h2>Manage your credit and debt</h2>\n<p><div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=2R7jTWgEwrk:2lO6GEcf1O8:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=2R7jTWgEwrk:2lO6GEcf1O8:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=2R7jTWgEwrk:2lO6GEcf1O8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=2R7jTWgEwrk:2lO6GEcf1O8:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=2R7jTWgEwrk:2lO6GEcf1O8:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=2R7jTWgEwrk:2lO6GEcf1O8:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=2R7jTWgEwrk:2lO6GEcf1O8:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=2R7jTWgEwrk:2lO6GEcf1O8:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/2R7jTWgEwrk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 14 Apr 2021 17:39:06 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"b8414c600ea194211caf7bfafb686f9d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn55@2020_4/2021/04/14/18-15-23-816_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Jordan Crook","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn55@2020_4/2021/04/14/18-15-23-816_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn84@2020_5/2021/04/14/18-15-31-225_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn59@2020_5/2021/04/14/18-15-30-860_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=2R7jTWgEwrk:2lO6GEcf1O8:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn72@2020_4/2021/04/14/18-15-32-910_a05e636a28ab9b8f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=2R7jTWgEwrk:2lO6GEcf1O8:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn7@2020_6/2021/04/14/18-15-31-386_f71f95076152681b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn11@2020_2/2021/04/14/18-15-31-455_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/2R7jTWgEwrk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn15@2020_1/2021/04/14/18-15-31-454_47d284b4fcc97cae.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618424109524},{"createdTime":"2021-04-15 02:15:09","updatedTime":"2021-04-15 02:15:09","title":"How Pilot charted a course of not raising too much money","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2138317","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A few weeks ago, we wrote about fintech Pilot raising </span><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/27/jeff-bezos-investment-fund-is-backing-a-startup-hoping-to-be-the-aws-for-smb-accounting/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a $100 million Series C</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that doubled the company’s valuation to $1.2 billion. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bezos Expeditions — Amazon founder Jeff Bezos’ personal investment fund — and Whale Rock Capital joined the round, adding $40 million to a $60 million raise led by Sequoia about one month prior.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That raise came after </span><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/18/index-ventures-stripe-back-bookkeeping-service-pilot-with-40m/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a $40 million Series B</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in April 2019 co-led by Stripe and Index Ventures that valued the company at $355 million.</span></p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both raises were notable and warranted coverage.

When it was presented with the opportunity for additional funding towards further growth in 2019, it declined to do so.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Co-founder and CEO Waseem Daher elaborates, pointing out that the first company that Pilot&#8217;s founding team ran, Ksplice, was bootstrapped before getting acquired by Oracle in 2011. (It&#8217;s also worth noting that the founding team are all MIT computer scientists.)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Ultimately, the reason to raise money is you believe that you can deploy the capital, to grow the company or to basically cause the company to grow at the rate you&#8217;d like to grow.

Now all you need is a smartphone. <a href=\"https://avatarify.ai/\">Avatarify</a>, a startup that allows people to make deep-fake videos directly on their phone rather than in the Cloud, is soaring up the app charts after being used by celebrities such as Victoria Beckham.</p>\n<p>However, the problem with many deep fake videos is that there is no digital watermark to determine that the video has been tampered with. So Avatarify says it will soon launch a digital watermark to prevent this from happening.</p>\n<p>Run out of Moscow but with a US HQ, Avatarify launched in  July 2020 and since then has been downloaded millions of times. The founders say that 140 million deepfake videos were created with Avatarify this year alone. There are now 125 million views of videos with the hashtag #avatarify on TikTok. While its competitors include the well-funded Reface, Snapchat, Wombo.ai, Mug Life, Xpression, Avatarify has yet to raise any money beyond an Angel round.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>Despite taking only $120,000 in angel funding, the company has yet to accept any venture capital and says it has bootstrapped its way from zero to almost 10 million downloads and claims to have a $10 million annual run-rate with a team of less than 10 people.</p>\n<p>It’s not hard to see why. Avatarify has a freemium subscription model. They offer a 7-day free trial and a 12-month subscription for $34.99 or a weekly plan for $2.49. Without a subscription, they offer the core features of the App for free, but videos then carry a visible watermark.</p>\n<p>The founders also say the app protects privacy, because the videos are processed directly on the phone, rather than in the cloud where they could be hacked.</p>\n<p>Avatarify processes user&#8217;s photos and turns them into short videos by animating faces, using machine learning algorithms, and adding sounds. The user chooses a picture she wants to animate, chooses the effects and music, and then taps to animate the picture. This short video can then be posted on Instagram or TikTok.</p>\n<p>The Avatarify videos are taking off on TikTok because teens no longer need to learn a dance or be much more creative than finding a photo of a celebrity to animate to.</p>\n<p>Avartify says you can’t use their app to impersonate someone, but there is of course no way to police this.</p>\n<p>Founders Ali Aliev and Karim Iskakov wrote the app during the COVID-19 lockdown in April 2020. Ali spent 2 hours writing a program in Python to transfer his facial expressions to the other person’s face and use a filter in Zoom. The result was a real-time video, which could be streamed to Zoom. He joined a call with Elon Mask&#8217;s face and everyone on the call was shocked. The team posted the video, which then went viral.</p>\n<p>The code on Github and immediately saw the number of downloads grow.

Promising pilots and research mean the company is poised to go big as education changes, and it has raised $11 million to scale up with a new app and growing customer base.</p>\n<p>In classrooms, a common exercise is to have students read aloud from a storybook or worksheet. The teacher listens carefully, stopping and correcting students on difficult words. This &#8220;guided reading&#8221; process is fundamental for both instruction and assessment: It not only helps the kids learn, but the teacher can break the class up into groups with similar reading levels so she can offer tailored lessons.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Guided reading is needs-based, differentiated instruction and in COVID we couldn&#8217;t do it,&#8221; said <span style=\"color: #000000;\">Andrea Burkiett, director of Elementary Curriculum and Instruction at the Savannah-Chatham County Public School System. Breakout sessions are technically possible, &#8220;but when you&#8217;re talking about a kindergarten student who doesn&#8217;t even know how to use a mouse or touchpad, COVID basically made small groups nonexistent.&#8221;</span></p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>Amira replicates the guided reading process by analyzing the child&#8217;s speech as they read through a story and identifying things like mispronunciations, skipped words and other common stumbles. It&#8217;s based on research going back 20 years that has tested whether learners using such an automated system actually see any gains (and they did, though generally in a lab setting).</p>\n<p>In fact I was speaking to Burkiett out of skepticism — &#8220;AI&#8221; products are thick on the ground and while it does little harm if one recommends you a recipe you don&#8217;t like, it&#8217;s a serious matter if a kid&#8217;s education is impacted. I wanted to be sure this wasn&#8217;t a random app hawking old research to lend itself credibility, and after talking with Burkiett and CEO Mark Angel I feel it&#8217;s quite the opposite and could actually be a valuable tool for educators. But it needed to convince educators first.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"jbcU74AaY1\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/outschool-series-c-unicorn/\">Outschool is the newest edtech unicorn</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Outschool is the newest edtech unicorn&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/outschool-series-c-unicorn/embed/#?secret=jbcU74AaY1\" data-secret=\"jbcU74AaY1\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<h2>Not a replacement but a force multiplier</h2>\n<p>&#8220;You have to start by truly identifying the reason for wanting to employ a tech tool,&#8221; said Burkiett. &#8220;There are a lot of tech tools out there that are exciting, fun for kids, etc., but we could use all of them and not impact growth or learning at all because we didn&#8217;t stop and say, this tool helps me with this need.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Amira was decided on as one that addresses the particular need in the K-5 range of steadily improving reading level through constant practice and feedback.</p>\n<p>&#8220;When COVID hit, every tech tool came out of the woodwork and was made free and available,&#8221; Burkiett recalled. &#8220;With Amira you&#8217;re looking at a 1:1 tutor at their specific level. She&#8217;s not a replacement for a teacher — though it has been that way in COVID — but beyond COVID she could become a force multiplier,&#8221; said Burkiett.</p>\n<p>You can see the old version of Amira in action below, though it&#8217;s been updated since:</p>\n<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/KRto8CIxb7Q?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>\n<p>Testing Amira with her own district&#8217;s students, Burkiett replicated the results that have been obtained in more controlled settings: As much as twice or three times as much progress in reading level based on standard assessment tools, some of which are built into the teacher-side Amira app.</p>\n<p>Naturally it isn&#8217;t possible to simply attribute all this improvement to Amira — there are other variables in play. But it appears to help and doesn&#8217;t hinder, and the effect correlates with frequency of use. The exact mechanism isn&#8217;t as important as the fact that kids learn faster when they use the app versus when they don&#8217;t, and furthermore this allows teachers to better allocate resources and time. A kid who can&#8217;t use it as often because their family shares a single computer is at a disadvantage that has nothing to do with their aptitude — but this problem can be detected and accounted for by the teacher, unlike a simple &#8220;read at home&#8221; assignment.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Outside COVID we would always have students struggling with reading, and we would have parents with the money and knowledge to support their student,&#8221; Burkiett explained. &#8220;But now we can take this tool and offer it to students regardless of mom and dad&#8217;s time, mom and dad&#8217;s ability to pay. We can now give that tutor session to every single student.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>&#8220;Radically suboptimal conditions&#8221;</h2>\n<p>This is familiar territory for CEO Mark Angel, though the AI aspect, he admits, is new.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A lot of the Amira team came from Renaissance Learning. bringing fairly conventional edtech software into elementary school classrooms at scale. The actual tech we used was very simple compared to Amira — the big challenge was trying to figure out how to make applications work with the teacher workflow, or make them friendly and resilient when 6-year-olds are your users,&#8221; he told me.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"u5eDL08RkX\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2014/03/13/private-equity-firm-hellman-friedman-acquires-learning-analytics-company-renaissance-learning-for-1-1b-in-cash/\">Private Equity Firm Hellman &#38; Friedman Acquires Learning Analytics Company Renaissance Learning For $1.1B In Cash</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Private Equity Firm Hellman &#38; Friedman Acquires Learning Analytics Company Renaissance Learning For $1.1B In Cash&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2014/03/13/private-equity-firm-hellman-friedman-acquires-learning-analytics-company-renaissance-learning-for-1-1b-in-cash/embed/#?secret=u5eDL08RkX\" data-secret=\"u5eDL08RkX\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8220;Not to make it trite, but what we&#8217;ve learned is really just listen to teachers — they&#8217;re the superusers,&#8221; Angel continued. &#8220;And to design for radically suboptimal conditions, like background noise, kids playing with the microphone, the myriad things that happen in real-life circumstances.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Once they were confident in the ability of the app to reliably decode words, the system was given three fundamental tasks that fall under the broader umbrella of machine learning.</p>\n<p>The first is telling the difference between a sentence being read correctly and incorrectly. This can be difficult due to the many normal differences between speakers. Singling out errors that matter, versus simply deviation from an imaginary norm (in speech recognition that is often American English as spoken by white people) lets readers go at their own pace and in their own voice, with only actual issues like saying a silent k noted by the app.</p>\n<p>(On that note, considering the prevalence of English language learners with accents, I asked about the company&#8217;s performance and approach there. Angel said they and their research partners went to great lengths to make sure they had a representative dataset, and that the model only flags pronunciations that indicate a word was not read or understood correctly.)</p>\n<p>The second is knowing what action to take to correct an error. In the case of a silent k, it matters whether this is a first grader who is still learning spelling or a fourth grader who is proficient. And is this the first time they&#8217;ve made that mistake, or the tenth? Do they need an explanation of why the word is this way, or several examples of similar words? &#8220;It&#8217;s about helping a student at a moment in time,&#8221; Angel said, both in the moment of reading that word, and in the context of their current state as a learner.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2138059\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/amira-assessment.png\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2138059\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2138059 size-full\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/amira-assessment.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of a reading assessment in the app Amira.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"667\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/amira-assessment.png 1182w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/amira-assessment.png?resize=150,98 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/amira-assessment.png?resize=300,195 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/amira-assessment.png?resize=768,500 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/amira-assessment.png?resize=680,443 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/amira-assessment.png?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2138059\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Amira Learning</p></div></p>\n<p>Third is a data-based triage system that warns students and parents if a kid may potentially have a language learning disorder like dyslexia. The patterns are there in how they read — and while a system like Amira can&#8217;t actually diagnose, it can flag kids who may be high risk to receive a more thorough screening. (A note on privacy: Angel assured me that all information is totally private and by default is considered to belong to the district. &#8220;You&#8217;d have to be insane to take advantage of it. We&#8217;d be out of business in a nanosecond.&#8221;)</p>\n<p>The $11 million in funding comes at what could be a hockey-stick moment for Amira&#8217;s adoption.

The data is quite scary — more than two-thirds of our fourth graders aren&#8217;t proficient readers, and those two-thirds aren&#8217;t equally distributed by income or race. It&#8217;s a decades-long struggle.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Having basically given the product away for a year, the company is now looking at how to convert those users into customers. It seems like, just like the rest of society, &#8220;going back to normal&#8221; doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean going back to 2019 entirely. The lessons of the pandemic era are sticking.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"Sjd3yXvbtI\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/y-combinator-widens-its-bet-in-edtech-in-latest-batch/\">Y Combinator widens its bet in edtech in latest batch</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Y Combinator widens its bet in edtech in latest batch&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/y-combinator-widens-its-bet-in-edtech-in-latest-batch/embed/#?secret=Sjd3yXvbtI\" data-secret=\"Sjd3yXvbtI\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8220;They don&#8217;t have the intention to just go back to the old ways,&#8221; Angel explained. &#8220;They&#8217;re searching for a new synthesis — how to incorporate tech, but do it in a classroom with kids elbow to elbow and interacting with teachers. So we&#8217;re focused on making Amira the norm in a post-COVID classroom.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Part of that is making sure the app works with language learners at more levels and grades, so the team is working to expand its capabilities upward to include middle-school students as well as elementary.

I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;re going to go super high-end to start.&#8221;</p>\n<p>That said, the company&#8217;s cap table of investors already includes some pretty heady culinary company. <a href=\"http://acre.vc/#company-info-full\">Acre Venture Partners</a> (which counts Sam Kass &#8212; President Barack Obama&#8217;s Senior Policy Advisor for Nutrition Policy, Executive Director for First Lady Michelle Obama&#8217;s Let&#8217;s Move! campaign, and an Assistant Chef in the White House &#8212; among its partnership) is an investor. So is Chicago&#8217;s fine dining temple, Alinea.</p>\n<p>But Huggins wants Meati to be an everyday type of meat replacement product. &#8220;I want to make sure that people think this is an every day protein,&#8221; Huggins said.</p>\n<p>Meati thinks its future meat replacements will be cost competitive with conventional beef and chicken, but to whet consumers&#8217; appetites, the company is starting with jerky.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">&#8220;Meati’s delicious jerky,&#8221; said Huggins. &#8220;It provides this blank canvas. We’ll start with these beef jerky like flavors. But I want to come out of the gate and say that we’re mycelium jerky.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p>The company currently has 30 people on staff led by Huggins and fo-founder Justin Whiteley. The two men initially started working on Meati as a battery replacement. Based on their research (Huggins with mycelium and Whiteley with advanced batteries) the two men received a grant for a mycelium-based electrode for lithium ion batteries.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We were trying to tweak the chemical composition of the mycelium to make a better battery. What we found was that we were making something nutritious and edible,&#8221; said Huggins.</p>\n<p>Also&#8230; the battery companies didn&#8217;t want it.</p>\n<p>Now, backed by $28 million from Acre, Prelude Ventures, Congruent Ventures and Tao Capital, Meati is ready to go to market. The company also has access to debt capital to build out its vast network of mycelium growing facilities. It&#8217;s just raised a $18 million debt round from Trinity and Silicon Valley Bank.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;Two years ago … most companies in this space … there wasn’t this ability to take on debt to put steel in the ground,&#8221; said Huggins. &#8220;It’s an exciting time to be in food tech given that you can raise VC funding and there’s this ready available market for debt financing. You’ll start seeing faster and more rapid development because of it.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2138413\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2138413\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2138413\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/02-Tyler-Justin-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/02-Tyler-Justin-2.jpg 5203w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/02-Tyler-Justin-2.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/02-Tyler-Justin-2.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/02-Tyler-Justin-2.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/02-Tyler-Justin-2.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/02-Tyler-Justin-2.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/02-Tyler-Justin-2.jpg?resize=2048,1367 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/02-Tyler-Justin-2.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2138413\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Meati co-founders Tyler Huggins and Justin Whiteley.

We resisted the fool’s errand of trying to create a system that could work entirely unsupervised or solve every robotics problem out there.”</p>\n<p>Orders for the first product targeted at trailer unloading will open in June, with an expected ship date of early 2022.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"lDvbZ4n1DA\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/11/why-so-many-robotic-startups-fail-and-what-can-be-done-about-it/\">Why so many robotic startups fail, and what can be done about it</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Why so many robotic startups fail, and what can be done about it&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/11/why-so-many-robotic-startups-fail-and-what-can-be-done-about-it/embed/#?secret=lDvbZ4n1DA\" data-secret=\"lDvbZ4n1DA\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=fN3SimeaSLE:I7Jx6bXpenY:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=fN3SimeaSLE:I7Jx6bXpenY:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=fN3SimeaSLE:I7Jx6bXpenY:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=fN3SimeaSLE:I7Jx6bXpenY:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=fN3SimeaSLE:I7Jx6bXpenY:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=fN3SimeaSLE:I7Jx6bXpenY:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=fN3SimeaSLE:I7Jx6bXpenY:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=fN3SimeaSLE:I7Jx6bXpenY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/fN3SimeaSLE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 14 Apr 2021 17:42:17 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"d89ce2c53c3acdaf71e3b44a99dfe81c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn55@2020_4/2021/04/14/18-15-23-816_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Brian Heater","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn55@2020_4/2021/04/14/18-15-23-816_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn84@2020_5/2021/04/14/18-15-31-225_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn59@2020_5/2021/04/14/18-15-30-860_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=fN3SimeaSLE:I7Jx6bXpenY:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn64@2020_4/2021/04/14/18-15-31-237_8426dd06e8bd9cd1.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=fN3SimeaSLE:I7Jx6bXpenY:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn71@2020_2/2021/04/14/18-15-30-896_28dee6f3d62da62e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn11@2020_2/2021/04/14/18-15-31-455_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/fN3SimeaSLE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn5@2020_1/2021/04/14/18-15-30-872_c413002c22e75c10.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618424109525},{"createdTime":"2021-04-15 02:15:09","updatedTime":"2021-04-15 02:15:09","title":"Indian fintech Zeta turns unicorn with SoftBank-led funding","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2138454","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Bangalore-based fintech startup <a href=\"https://www.zeta.tech/in\">Zeta</a> has clinched the much sought-after unicorn status after finalizing a new financing round led by SoftBank Vision Fund 2, sources familiar with the matter told TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>SoftBank Vision Fund 2 has led a ~$250 million Series D round in the five-year-old Indian startup, the sources said.

satellites","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2138366","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Space startup Astranis has raised a $250 million Series C round to provide it with a capital injection to help scale manufacturing of its unique MicroGEO satellites — geostationary communications satellites that are much smaller than the typical massive, expensive spacecraft used in that orbital band to provide communications and connectivity to specific points on Earth.</p>\n<p>The Astranis Series C was led by BlackRock-managed funds, and includes participation from a host of new investors including Baillie Gifford, Fidelity, Koch Strategic Platforms and more. Existing investors including Andreessen Horowitz, Venrock, and more also chipped in, with the raise valuing the company at $1.4 billion post-money.</p>\n<p>This brings the total funding raised by Astranis to over $350 million, including both equity and debt financing. Astranis got started only in 2016, and was part of the YC Winter 2016 cohort. While a lot of other companies are looking to build satellite constellations in low-Earth orbit to provide low-cost broadband on Earth, Astranis, led by co-founder and CEO John Gedmark, is focused on the GEO band, where the large legacy communications satellites currently operate, orbiting the Earth at a fixed position and providing connectivity to a set area on Earth.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"4yz8fFod38\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/17/astranis-reaches-key-milestone-with-microgeo-communication-satellite-aims-for-service-to-begin-next-summer/\">Astranis reaches key milestone with MicroGEO communication satellite, aims for service to begin next summer</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Astranis reaches key milestone with MicroGEO communication satellite, aims for service to begin next summer&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/17/astranis-reaches-key-milestone-with-microgeo-communication-satellite-aims-for-service-to-begin-next-summer/embed/#?secret=4yz8fFod38\" data-secret=\"4yz8fFod38\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>Gedmark has <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/17/astranis-reaches-key-milestone-with-microgeo-communication-satellite-aims-for-service-to-begin-next-summer/\">told me previously</a> that the company&#8217;s offering is very different from the LEO constellations being put up and operated by companies including SpaceX, because they&#8217;re essentially a much more targeted, nimble solution that works with existing ground infrastructure. Customers who have a specific regional need for connectivity can get Astranis to put one one up at a greatly reduced cost compared to a traditional GEO communications satellite, and do so to replace or upgrade aging existing satellite network infrastructure, for example.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that BlackRock, which led this round, has also been a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/rocket-startup-astra-is-going-public-vis-spac/\">key participant in the PIPE components of high-profile space startup SPACs like launcher company Astra&#8217;s</a>.

Through the <a href=\"https://www.openavenuesfoundation.org/global-talent\">Global Talent Fellowship</a> program, the foundation offers a unique solution for employers like you to have a Plan B for H-1Bs: It’s possible to obtain an H-1B visa for an existing or prospective employee without going through the <a href=\"https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/060-h-1b-lottery-planning-part-2/\">H-1B lottery</a> process — or the randomness and timing restrictions that come with it. Goldman refers to the program as “innovation within legislation.”</p>\n<p>So how does that work? Well, first off, you should know that four categories of employers are exempt from the annual H-1B lottery, meaning they can apply for an H-1B visa at any time of year and their pool of H-1B visas is not capped.

of drivers in Europe have trumpeted winning a default judgement in the Netherlands &#8212; where the Court of Amsterdam <a href=\"https://uitspraken.rechtspraak.nl/inziendocument?id=ECLI:NL:RBAMS:2021:1415&#38;showbutton=true&#38;keyword=ECLI%3aNL%3aRBAMS%3a2021%3a1415\">ordered</a> the ride-hailing giant to reinstate six drivers who the litigants claim were unfairly terminated &#8220;by algorithmic means.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The court also ordered Uber to pay the fired drivers compensation.</p>\n<p>The challenge references Article 22 of the European Union&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) &#8212; which provides protection for individuals against purely automated decisions with a legal or significant impact.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>The activists say this is the first time a court has ordered the overturning of an automated decision to dismiss workers from employment.</p>\n<p>However the judgement, which was issued on February 24, was issued by default &#8212; and Uber says it was not aware of the case until last week, claiming that was why it did not contest it (nor, indeed, comply with the order).</p>\n<p>It had until March 29 to do so, per the litigants, who are being supported by the App Drivers &#38; Couriers Union (ADCU) and Worker Info Exchange (WIE).</p>\n<p>Uber argues the default judgement was not correctly served and says it is now making an application to set the default ruling aside and have its case heard &#8220;on the basis that the correct procedure was not followed.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It envisages the hearing taking place within four weeks of its Dutch entity, Uber BV, being made aware of the judgement &#8212; which it says occurred on April 8.</p>\n<p>“Uber only became aware of this default judgement last week, due to representatives for the ADCU not following proper legal procedure,&#8221; an Uber spokesperson told TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>A spokesperson for WIE denied that correct procedure was not followed but welcomed the opportunity for Uber to respond to questions over how its driver ID systems operate in court, adding: &#8220;They [Uber] are out of time. But we&#8217;d be happy to see them in court. They will need to show meaningful human intervention <em>and</em> provide transparency.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Uber pointed to a separate judgement by the Amsterdam Court <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/12/dutch-court-rejects-uber-drivers-robo-firing-charge-but-tells-ola-to-explain-algo-deductions/\">last month</a> &#8212; which rejected another ADCU- and WIE-backed challenge to Uber&#8217;s anti-fraud systems, with the court accepting its explanation that algorithmic tools are mere aids to human &#8220;anti-fraud&#8221; teams who it said take all decisions on terminations.</p>\n<p>&#8220;With no knowledge of the case, the Court handed down a default judgement in our absence, which was automatic and not considered. Only weeks later, the very same Court found comprehensively in Uber’s favour on similar issues in a separate case. We will now contest this judgement,&#8221; Uber&#8217;s spokesperson added.</p>\n<p>However WIE said this default judgement &#8220;robo-firing&#8221; challenge specifically targets Uber&#8217;s Hybrid Real-Time ID System &#8212; a system that incorporates facial recognition checks and which labor activists recently found <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/19/uber-under-pressure-over-facial-recognition-checks-for-drivers/\">misidentifying drivers in a number of instances</a>.</p>\n<p>It also pointed to a separate development this week in the U.K. where it said the City of London Magistrates Court ordered the city&#8217;s transport regulator, TfL, to reinstate the licence of one of the drivers revoked after Uber routinely notified it of a dismissal (also triggered by Uber&#8217;s real time ID system, per WIE).</p>\n<p>Reached for comment on that, a TfL spokesperson said: “The safety of the travelling public is our top priority and where we are notified of cases of driver identity fraud, we take immediate licensing action so that passenger safety is not compromised. We always require the evidence behind an operator’s decision to dismiss a driver and review it along with any other relevant information as part of any decision to revoke a licence. All drivers have the right to appeal a decision to remove a licence through the Magistrates’ Court.”</p>\n<p>The regulator has been applying pressure to Uber since <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/22/uber-loses-its-license-to-operate-in-london/\">2017</a> when it took the (<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/23/uber-only-has-itself-to-blame-for-london-license-loss/\">shocking to Uber</a>) decision to revoke the company&#8217;s licence to operate &#8212; citing safety and corporate governance concerns.</p>\n<p>Since then Uber has been able to continue to operate in the U.K. capital but the company remains under pressure to comply with a laundry list of requirements set by TfL as it <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/28/uber-wins-latest-london-licence-appeal/\">tries to regain a full operator licence</a>.</p>\n<p>Commenting on the default Dutch judgement on the Uber driver terminations in a statement, James Farrar, director of WIE, accused gig platforms of &#8220;hiding management control in algorithms.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;For the Uber drivers robbed of their jobs and livelihoods this has been a dystopian nightmare come true,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They were publicly accused of ‘fraudulent activity’ on the back of poorly governed use of bad technology. This case is a wake-up call for lawmakers about the abuse of surveillance technology now proliferating in the gig economy. In the aftermath of the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/uber-loses-gig-workers-rights-challenge-in-uk-supreme-court/\">recent U.K. Supreme Court ruling</a> on worker rights gig economy platforms are hiding management control in algorithms. This is misclassification 2.0.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In another supporting statement, Yaseen Aslam, president of the ADCU, added: &#8220;I am deeply concerned about the complicit role Transport for London has played in this catastrophe. They have encouraged Uber to introduce surveillance technology as a price for keeping their operator’s license and the result has been devastating for a TfL licensed workforce that is 94% BAME. The Mayor of London must step in and guarantee the rights and freedoms of Uber drivers licensed under his administration<em>.&#8221;  </em></p>\n<p>When pressed on the driver termination challenge being specifically targeted at its Hybrid Real-Time ID system, Uber declined to comment in greater detail &#8212; claiming the case is &#8220;now a live court case again&#8221;.</p>\n<p>But its spokesman suggested it will seek to apply the same defence against the earlier &#8220;robo-firing&#8221; charge &#8212; when it argued its anti-fraud systems do not equate to automated decision making under EU law because &#8220;meaningful human involvement [is] involved in decisions of this nature&#8221;.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"bQm2N8eM6N\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/19/uber-under-pressure-over-facial-recognition-checks-for-drivers/\">Uber under pressure over facial recognition checks for drivers</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Uber under pressure over facial recognition checks for drivers&#8221;

and &#8220;downloaded the usernames, email addresses and passwords for a subset of our users in early February 2021.</p>\n<p>The notice did not say how the passwords were scrambled, if at all, to prevent them from being read by humans. Passwords scrambled using weak algorithms can sometimes be decoded into plain text, allowing malicious hackers to break into their accounts.</p>\n<p>Following the breach, Manhunt force-reset account passwords began alerting users in mid-March. Manhunt did not say what percentage of its users had their data stolen or how the data breach happened, but said that more than 7,700 Washington state residents were affected.</p>\n<p>The company&#8217;s attorneys did not reply to an email requesting comment.</p>\n<p>But questions remain about how Manhunt handled the breach. In March, the company <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Manhunt/status/1370012193056493568 \">tweeted</a> that, &#8220;At this time, all Manhunt users are required to update their password to ensure it meets the updated password requirements.&#8221; The tweet did not say that user accounts had been stolen.</p>\n<p>Manhunt was launched in 2001 by Online-Buddies Inc., which also offered gay dating app Jack&#8217;d before it <a href=\"https://www.bizjournals.com/newyork/news/2019/07/10/perry-street-owner-of-scruff-buys-jackd.html\">was sold</a> to Perry Street in 2019 for an undisclosed sum. Just months before the sale, Jack&#8217;d had <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/02/indecent-disclosure-gay-dating-app-left-private-exposed-to-web/\">a security lapse</a> that exposed users&#8217; private photos and location data.</p>\n<p>Dating sites store some of the most sensitive information on their users, and are frequently a target of malicious hackers. In 2015, Ashley Madison, a dating site that encouraged users to have an affair, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/03/have-i-been-pwned/\">was hacked</a>, exposing names, and postal and email addresses. Several people <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2015/08/24/ashley-madison-offering-500000-reward-for-info-on-hack-now-linked-to-two-suicides/\">died by suicide</a> after the stolen data was posted online. A year later, dating site AdultFriendFinder was hacked, exposing <a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/adultfriendfinder-network-hack-exposes-secrets-of-412-million-users/\">more than 400 million user accounts</a>.</p>\n<p>In 2018, same-sex dating app Grindr <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/azeenghorayshi/grindr-hiv-status-privacy\">made headlines</a> for sharing users&#8217; HIV status with data analytics firms.</p>\n<p>In other cases, poor security — in some cases none at all — led to data spills involving some of the most sensitive data. In 2019, Rela, a popular dating app for gay and queer women in China, left a server unsecured with no password, allowing anyone to access sensitive data — including sexual orientation and geolocation — on more than 5 million app users.

The short-form video app said it&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/trillernet-acquires-leading-ai-powered-customer-engagement-platform-amplifyai-for-completion-of-trillers-launch-of-internet-3-0-301269016.html\">acquiring</a> an A.I.-based customer engagement platform, Amplify.AI, whose co-founder Mahi de Silva will now become TrillerNet&#8217;s CEO. Existing CEO Mike Lu will transition to president of TrillerNet and will focus on investor relations. The company separately announced the <a href=\"https://www.thewrap.com/triller-parent-company-buys-combat-sports-streaming-service-fite-tv/\">acquisition</a> of FITE TV, a live event and pay-per-view combat sports streaming platform.</p>\n<p>New CEO <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/mdesilva/\">Mahi de Silva</a> had been closely involved with Triller before today. The company&#8217;s press release today says he&#8217;s been serving as non-executive chairman since 2016, but his LinkedIn notes the year was 2019 (which would be following Triller&#8217;s 2019 <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/triller-announces-record-breaking-growth-new-funding-by-proxima-media-and-acquisition-of-ai-music-platform-300944115.html\">funding</a> by Proxima Media, when the <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/triller-announces-record-breaking-growth-new-funding-by-proxima-media-and-acquisition-of-ai-music-platform-300944115.html\">press release at the time</a> noted he was assuming the role of &#8220;chairman.&#8221;)  These are both wrong, the company discovered when we reached out for clarity. The correct year is 2018.</p>\n<p>Ahead of the acquisition, de Silva had been serving as CEO and co-founder to Amplify.AI since 2017, and before that was CEO of Opera Mediaworks, the marketing and advertising arm of Opera Software, and co-founder and CEO of Botworx.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>Amplify.AI, which works with brands in CPG, financial services, automotive, telecom, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.in/business/startups/news/amplify-ai-the-conversational-ai-startup-founded-by-two-south-asians-has-scored-big-with-brands-and-governments/articleshow/80443958.cms\">politics</a> and digital media, among others, will continue to operate as a subsidiary of TrillerNet following the deal. Other team members include former RSA and VeriSign executive Ram Moskovitz who helped design and develop the digital certificates for SSL and code signing; and Amplify.ai co-founder and CTO Manoj Malhotra, a pioneer in B2C SMS messaging, the company notes.</p>\n<p>TrillerNet also today announced it&#8217;s acquiring another strategic property to help shift its business further into the direction of live events: FITE TV. This deal gives Triller more of a foothold in the live events and pay-per-view streaming market, it says. As a result, FITE, which touts 10 million users, will become the exclusive digital distributor of all Triller Fight Club boxing events going forward.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Acquiring FITE is part of the larger Triller strategy to bring together content, creators and commerce for the first time and the only place where they truly interact,&#8221; said Triller&#8217;s Ryan Kavanaugh, the former head of movie studio Relativity Media (<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/triller-wants-to-be-the-next-tiktok-its-backers-want-a-second-act-11602255601\">and controversial figure</a>) whose Proxima Media <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/04/triller-tiktok/\">became</a> Triller&#8217;s majority investor in <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/triller-announces-record-breaking-growth-new-funding-by-proxima-media-and-acquisition-of-ai-music-platform-300944115.html\">2019.</a> &#8220;We have invested hundreds of millions of dollars and believe we have created a better more efficient e-commerce content platform,&#8221; he added.</p>\n<p>The acquisition follows several others TrillerNet has made to expand into live events, now that becoming a TikTok replacement in the U.S. is no longer a viable option, as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/tiktoks-forced-sale-to-oracle-is-put-on-hold/\">the Trump ban was put on hold</a> by the Biden administration. Triller also in March acquired live music streaming platform Verzuz, founded by Swizz Beats and Timbaland. And it operates Triller Flight Club in partnership with Snoop Dogg, as well as a streaming platform Triller TV.</p>\n<p>While specific deal terms were not revealed, Triller told TechCrunch it&#8217;s spent $250 million in the aggregate on its acquisitions, including Halogen, Mashtraxx, Verzuz, FITE and Amplify today.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"fvxuDml8Yo\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/where-is-the-e-commerce-app-ecosystem-headed-in-2021/\">Where is the e-commerce app ecosystem headed in 2021?</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Where is the e-commerce app ecosystem headed in 2021?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/where-is-the-e-commerce-app-ecosystem-headed-in-2021/embed/#?secret=fvxuDml8Yo\" data-secret=\"fvxuDml8Yo\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=82svE2aDw7U:1HbW-1B3nQE:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=82svE2aDw7U:1HbW-1B3nQE:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=82svE2aDw7U:1HbW-1B3nQE:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=82svE2aDw7U:1HbW-1B3nQE:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=82svE2aDw7U:1HbW-1B3nQE:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=82svE2aDw7U:1HbW-1B3nQE:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=82svE2aDw7U:1HbW-1B3nQE:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=82svE2aDw7U:1HbW-1B3nQE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/82svE2aDw7U\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 14 Apr 2021 17:22:12 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"212cba7ba0cacd14bdcd00f8d06b882a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn55@2020_4/2021/04/14/18-15-23-816_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Sarah Perez","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn55@2020_4/2021/04/14/18-15-23-816_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn84@2020_5/2021/04/14/18-15-31-225_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn59@2020_5/2021/04/14/18-15-30-860_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=82svE2aDw7U:1HbW-1B3nQE:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn94@2020_3/2021/04/14/18-15-31-167_98b7bb2a19e87c63.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=82svE2aDw7U:1HbW-1B3nQE:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn56@2020_4/2021/04/14/18-15-31-465_f466a0c633b0e8ca.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn11@2020_2/2021/04/14/18-15-31-455_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/82svE2aDw7U":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn64@2020_1/2021/04/14/18-15-30-950_55569c0eacbeb368.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618424109532},{"createdTime":"2021-04-15 02:15:09","updatedTime":"2021-04-15 02:15:09","title":"Amazon’s latest Echo Buds are a shameless Apple knock-off","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2138361","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">This is Amazon&#8217;s latest hardware product: The redesigned Alexa earbuds. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/amazons-alexa-earbuds-return-with-a-smaller-design-and-wireless-charging/\">TechCrunch covered the announcement here</a>, where the specs and capabilities are listed. I&#8217;m sure they work fine, too, but the case design is a blatant rip-off of Apple&#8217;s AirPod Pros.</p>\n<p>This is just lazy.</p>\n<p>Amazon has a long history of selling and promoting lookalikes, copycats, and clones of other products. Likewise, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/18/amazon-and-valentino-team-up-in-joint-lawsuit-against-new-york-counterfeiter-over-rockstud-knock-offs/\">the retailer sued</a> third-party sellers for doing the same thing. Amazon also has been accused of investing in companies and later producing clones of the products. In 2020 <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/29/bezos-cant-guarantee-no-anti-competitive-activity-as-congress-catches-him-flat-footed/\">CEO Jeff Bezos testified on this subject</a> in front of a congressional hearing where he couldn&#8217;t guarantee the company would end this process. Often the products Amazon copies come from small startups without the resources to fight a giant like Amazon.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>Last month California-based <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbxWGjQ2szQ\">Peak Design took to YouTube to protest Amazon&#8217;s unabashed copy of one of Peak&#8217;s top products</a>. As Peak points out, Amazon&#8217;s take is a cheap knockoff made from lower quality materials and without Peak Design&#8217;s ethical manufacturing. The video quickly went viral, amassing over 4.5 million hits and highlighting Amazon&#8217;s shady practices.</p>\n<p>For the latest Echo Buds, Amazon copied a market leader instead of a small startup. To recap, Amazon, a company worth over a trillion dollars, just released a product that looks essentially identical to a top-selling product from Apple, a company worth 2 trillion dollars.</p>\n<p>The Echo Buds are much less expensive than Apple&#8217;s $250 AirPod Pros, too. The standard Echo Buds costs $100, and the version with wireless charging runs $120. It&#8217;s important to note the wireless buds themselves do not look like AirPods. Amazon only copied the ubiquitous AirPod Pro case.</p>\n<p>The consumer is the loser here. With more resources than many countries, Amazon can produce world-class products, yet it decided to copy a rival&#8217;s market-leading product. In the end, it&#8217;s easier (and cheaper) to follow trends than become a trendsetter.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Peak Design takes on Amazon</h2>\n<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/HbxWGjQ2szQ?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=y8sG9Xfv7fA:pLLpgnfpXjo:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=y8sG9Xfv7fA:pLLpgnfpXjo:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=y8sG9Xfv7fA:pLLpgnfpXjo:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=y8sG9Xfv7fA:pLLpgnfpXjo:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=y8sG9Xfv7fA:pLLpgnfpXjo:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=y8sG9Xfv7fA:pLLpgnfpXjo:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=y8sG9Xfv7fA:pLLpgnfpXjo:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=y8sG9Xfv7fA:pLLpgnfpXjo:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/y8sG9Xfv7fA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 14 Apr 2021 15:45:57 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"33ab7bc55f56c549e45fbbbde211910b","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn55@2020_4/2021/04/14/18-15-23-816_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Matt Burns","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn55@2020_4/2021/04/14/18-15-23-816_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn84@2020_5/2021/04/14/18-15-31-225_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn59@2020_5/2021/04/14/18-15-30-860_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=y8sG9Xfv7fA:pLLpgnfpXjo:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn23@2020_5/2021/04/14/18-15-31-681_97889770802650a1.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=y8sG9Xfv7fA:pLLpgnfpXjo:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn16@2020_1/2021/04/14/18-15-30-877_454e308fa1bbccef.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn11@2020_2/2021/04/14/18-15-31-455_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/y8sG9Xfv7fA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn97@2020_4/2021/04/14/18-15-30-880_1a3140fed4a72fe7.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618424109536},{"createdTime":"2021-04-15 02:15:09","updatedTime":"2021-04-15 02:15:09","title":"Coinbase opens at $381 per share, valuing the crypto exchange at nearly $100B","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2138331","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Today shares of Coinbase began to trade after the company <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/coinbases-monster-q1-in-context/\">executed a direct listing</a>.

Private investors <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/30/coinbase-is-now-valued-at-8b-after-closing-new-300m-round/\">poured capital into the company</a> during its life as a private company, valuing it as high as $8 billion.</p>\n<p>The company&#8217;s new valuation dwarfs that prior figure, implying strong returns for its long-term backers. Today even regular folks could get a scratch at the company&#8217;s equity, and they were willing to pay up for the privilege. TechCrunch asked its audience about the debut, pre-trading results that served as an anti-indicator of where the crypto-unicorn&#8217;s shares would trade:</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Would you pay more or less than $250/share for Coinbase? (read up on today&#39;s direct listing: <a href=\"https://t.co/xd8xP4YwWX\">https://t.co/xd8xP4YwWX</a>)</p>\n<p>&#8212; Extra Crunch (@ExtraCrunch) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ExtraCrunch/status/1382333411898101760?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 14, 2021</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div>\n<p>For Coinbase the road ahead is interesting. The company is richly capitalized, and posted monster profits in its most recent quarter. However, Coinbase has yet to chart a future sufficiently de-linked from the impacts of cryptocurrency price levels and resulting trading volume to be immune to a potential setback in growth, and income if the value of bitcoin et al dropped.</p>\n<p>But for crypto believers, watching Coinbase list is a win; it is ironic that a traditional company listing on an old-fashioned exchange is a key moment for the crypto-economy, but most things come in steps. Perhaps the next major crypto company trading debut will be on a decentralized exchange.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"Ms54mWJNVG\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/five-takeaways-from-coinbases-s-1/\">Five takeaways from Coinbase&#8217;s S-1</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Five takeaways from Coinbase&#8217;s S-1&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/five-takeaways-from-coinbases-s-1/embed/#?secret=Ms54mWJNVG\" data-secret=\"Ms54mWJNVG\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Q9s7oqT8BJk:2xbUt5tywXk:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Q9s7oqT8BJk:2xbUt5tywXk:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Q9s7oqT8BJk:2xbUt5tywXk:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Q9s7oqT8BJk:2xbUt5tywXk:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=Q9s7oqT8BJk:2xbUt5tywXk:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Q9s7oqT8BJk:2xbUt5tywXk:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=Q9s7oqT8BJk:2xbUt5tywXk:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Q9s7oqT8BJk:2xbUt5tywXk:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/Q9s7oqT8BJk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 14 Apr 2021 17:36:09 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"83fac88f1b036205a836c74628d68283","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn55@2020_4/2021/04/14/18-15-23-816_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Alex Wilhelm","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn55@2020_4/2021/04/14/18-15-23-816_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn84@2020_5/2021/04/14/18-15-31-225_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn59@2020_5/2021/04/14/18-15-30-860_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=Q9s7oqT8BJk:2xbUt5tywXk:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn90@2020_3/2021/04/14/18-15-35-915_220851faaf11561d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=Q9s7oqT8BJk:2xbUt5tywXk:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn79@2020_6/2021/04/14/18-15-31-418_e751795e20250210.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn11@2020_2/2021/04/14/18-15-31-455_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/Q9s7oqT8BJk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn74@2020_2/2021/04/14/18-15-30-877_a95efa79ecd6cac7.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618424109528},{"createdTime":"2021-04-15 02:15:09","updatedTime":"2021-04-15 02:15:09","title":"Blue Origin launches and lands New Shepard rocket in key prep flight for human passengers","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2138485","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Blue Origin has launched its New Shepard rocket for the second time this year, and the 15th time overall. The mission profile saw the reusable spacecraft fly to suborbital space, and then return for a parachute-assisted landing at Blue Origin&#8217;s launch facility in West Texas.</p>\n<p>This flight was a little different than its usual missions, because it included a rehearsal component with people standing in for what will eventually be Blue Origin&#8217;s paying private astronaut customers. What that means is that they actually went through the process of flight preparations, including transporting to the pad, and even climbing in to the New Shepard vehicle and getting seated as if they were going along for the ride.</p>\n<p>The crucial difference between this and an actual passenger flight is that Blue Origin then paused the countdown, and the mock crew disembarked, before the countdown was resumed and the flight proceeded as planned — without any passengers, save for Mannequin Skywalker, the Blue Origin test dummy who flies on these preparation missions to take crucial readings during the launch and return.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>New Shepard returned and touched down without any issue, and in fact showed off one of its smoothest landings yet. This was the second launch and landing for this particular booster stage. The capsule also touched down as planned, with a soft landing facilitated by the spacecraft&#8217;s parachute descent system.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2138511\" style=\"width: 1010px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ns-15-landing-blue-origin.gif\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2138511\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2138511 size-full\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ns-15-landing-blue-origin.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"552\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2138511\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Blue Origin</p></div></p>\n<p>Next up, Blue Origin is going to do a dry run of what would be the ending stage of the mission for an actual human crew, by bringing out those rehearsal astronauts and putting them back into the capsule, then rehearsing in full the astronaut recovery and departure process that would occur during a live tourist flight.</p>\n<p>All of today&#8217;s activities showed off what Blue Origin hopes to accomplish sometime this year with people on board.
