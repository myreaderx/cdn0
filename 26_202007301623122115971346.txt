The company’s rapid trajectory has been disrupted by on-going battles with the U.S. government that have, among other things, blocked its access to Google apps and services. But <a href=\"https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/Canalys-huawei-samsung-worldwide-smartphone-market-q2-2020#:~:text=in%20Q2%202020-,Canalys%3A%20Huawei%20trumps%20Samsung%20for%20first%20time%20in,smartphone%20market%20in%20Q2%202020&#38;text=Huawei%20shipped%20more%20smartphones%20worldwide,Apple%20has%20led%20the%20market.\">a new report from Canalys</a> paints a reasonably rosy picture as the hardware giant overtook Samsung to snag the top spot in global smartphone shipments for the second quarter of 2020. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The news is a milestone for a number of reasons, not the least of which is the fact that this is first time in nine years that neither Apple nor Samsung has been at the top of Canalys’ charts. Huawei’s figures were almost exclusively boosted by sales in its native China, which currently comprises more than 70% of its total figure.</span></p>\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><div id=\"attachment_2025015\" style=\"width: 910px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2025015\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2025015\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/C0yVpS2UPEdr5nQ1tlVc1s830QLh3Rp5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"506\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/C0yVpS2UPEdr5nQ1tlVc1s830QLh3Rp5.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/C0yVpS2UPEdr5nQ1tlVc1s830QLh3Rp5.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/C0yVpS2UPEdr5nQ1tlVc1s830QLh3Rp5.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/C0yVpS2UPEdr5nQ1tlVc1s830QLh3Rp5.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/C0yVpS2UPEdr5nQ1tlVc1s830QLh3Rp5.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/C0yVpS2UPEdr5nQ1tlVc1s830QLh3Rp5.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2025015\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Canalys</p></div></p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">It’s important to note here, however, the fact that the company took the top spot by essentially shrinking at a less rapid rate than Samsung. Huawei’s overall figures are down 5% year-over-year. But that figure pales in comparison to Samsung’s 30% drop. The two Goliaths are currently at 55.8 million and 53.7 million, respectively. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Things were bad for the smartphone industry prior to COVID-19, but the pandemic certainly hasn’t helped overall, as people are less inclined toward shelling out hundreds to north of $1,000 for inessential upgrades. And, indeed, Huawei’s numbers dropped by 27% outside of China, but the overall slide was dampened by an 8% growth in China. Samsung, meanwhile, currently controls less than 1% of the Chinese market. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As for what this all means for the future, it seems that it may be difficult for Huawei to maintain its top spot. “Its major channel partners in key regions, such as Europe, are increasingly wary of ranging Huawei devices, taking on fewer models, and bringing in new brands to reduce risk” Canalys’ Mo Jia said of the report. “Strength in China alone will not be enough to sustain Huawei at the top once the global economy starts to recover.”</span></p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=RXCw9nDYSPE:4V0--mmkz-U:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=RXCw9nDYSPE:4V0--mmkz-U:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=RXCw9nDYSPE:4V0--mmkz-U:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=RXCw9nDYSPE:4V0--mmkz-U:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=RXCw9nDYSPE:4V0--mmkz-U:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=RXCw9nDYSPE:4V0--mmkz-U:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=RXCw9nDYSPE:4V0--mmkz-U:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=RXCw9nDYSPE:4V0--mmkz-U:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/RXCw9nDYSPE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 30 Jul 2020 15:35:56 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/C0yVpS2UPEdr5nQ1tlVc1s830QLh3Rp5.jpg","linkMd5":"487ab7c0bae223628fdddece826046ab","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn42@2020_3/2020-07-30/1596126030977_645a2aacf92c9d5a.webp","author":"Brian Heater","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/C0yVpS2UPEdr5nQ1tlVc1s830QLh3Rp5.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn42@2020_3/2020-07-30/1596126030977_645a2aacf92c9d5a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn17@2020_1/2020-07-30/1596126033754_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn42@2020_5/2020-07-30/1596126034995_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn90@2020_1/2020-07-30/1596126033740_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=RXCw9nDYSPE:4V0--mmkz-U:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn61@2020_2/2020-07-30/1596126034658_8a49db53fafd8ee3.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=RXCw9nDYSPE:4V0--mmkz-U:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn78@2020_2/2020-07-30/1596126035521_2e630105b42ccb04.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn62@2020_3/2020-07-30/1596126035026_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/RXCw9nDYSPE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn73@2020_3/2020-07-30/1596126034815_8eb995858001afec.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-07-31 00:20:26","updatedTime":"2020-07-30 16:20:26","title":"Buildots raises $16M to bring computer vision to construction management","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2024289","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a href=\"https://buildots.com/\">Buildots</a>, a Tel Aviv and London-based startup that is using computer vision to modernize the construction management industry, today announced that it has raised $16 million in total funding.

The team is using hardhat-mounted 360-degree cameras to allow project managers at construction sites to get an overview of the state of a project and whether it remains on schedule. The company&#8217;s software creates a digital twin of the construction site, using the architectural plans and schedule as its basis, and then uses computer vision to compare what the plans say to the reality that its tools are seeing. With this, Buildots can immediately detect when there&#8217;s a power outlet missing in a room or whether there&#8217;s a sink that still needs to be installed in a kitchen, for example.</p>\n<p><span id=\"m_-4438620397716549337:7xd.29\"><span class=\"il\">&#8220;Buildots</span></span> have been able to solve a challenge that for many seemed unconquerable, delivering huge potential for changing the way we complete our projects,&#8221; said Tidhar&#8217;s <span id=\"m_-4438620397716549337:7xd.30\">Geva in a statement</span>. &#8220;The combination of an ambitious vision, great team and strong execution abilities quickly led us from being a customer to joining as an investor to take part in their journey.&#8221;</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/1u1hhrMVBvw?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>\n<p>The company was co-founded in 2018 by Roy <span id=\"m_-4438620397716549337:7xd.23\">Danon</span>, <span id=\"m_-4438620397716549337:7xd.24\">Aviv</span> <span id=\"m_-4438620397716549337:7xd.25\">Leibovici</span> and <span id=\"m_-4438620397716549337:7xd.26\">Yakir</span> Sundry. Like so many Israeli startups, the founders met during their time in the Israeli Defense Forces, where they graduated from the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talpiot_program\">Talpiot unit</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;At some point, like many of our friends, we had the urge to do something together &#8212; to build a company, to start something from scratch,&#8221; said Danon, the company&#8217;s CEO. &#8220;For us, we like getting our hands dirty. We saw most of our friends going into the most standard industries like cloud and cyber and storage and things that obviously people like us feel more comfortable in, but for some reason we had like a bug that said, &#8216;we want to do something that is a bit harder, that has a bigger impact on the world.&#8217; &#8221;</p>\n<p>So the team started looking into how it could bring technology to traditional industries like agriculture, finance and medicine, but then settled upon construction thanks to a chance meeting with a construction company. For the first six months, the team mostly did research in both Israel and London to understand where it could provide value.</p>\n<p>Danon argues that the construction industry is essentially a manufacturing industry, but with very outdated control and process management systems that still often relies on Excel to track progress.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2024295\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Side-by-side.png\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2024295\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2024295\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Side-by-side.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Side-by-side.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Side-by-side.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Side-by-side.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Side-by-side.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Side-by-side.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Side-by-side.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Side-by-side.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2024295\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Buildots</p></div></p>\n<p>Construction sites obviously pose their own problems. There&#8217;s often no Wi-Fi, for example, so contractors generally still have to upload their videos manually to Buildots&#8217; servers. They are also three dimensional, so the team had to develop systems to understand on what floor a video was taken, for example, and for large indoor spaces, GPS won&#8217;t work either.</p>\n<p>The teams tells me that before the COVID-19 lockdowns, it was mostly focused on Israel and the U.K., but the pandemic actually accelerated its push into other geographies. It just started work on a large project in Poland and is scheduled to work on another one in Japan next month.</p>\n<p>Because the construction industry is very project-driven, sales often start with getting one project manager on board. That project manager also usually owns the budget for the project, so they can often also sign the check, Danon noted.

lithium-ion cells it produces and supplies to Tesla, a change that improves energy density by 5% and reduces costly cobalt content.</p>\n<p>The new, higher-energy dense 2170 cells will be produced by Panasonic at <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/tesla-motors\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"tesla-motors\">Tesla&#8217;s <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> factory in Sparks, Nevada, the company said Thursday. Panasonic is upgrading its battery cell lines with production slated to begin in September. The company operates 13 lines at the factory with a capacity to produce 35 gigawatt hours of batteries each year. All 13 lines will eventually run the new technology, Panasonic Energy North America President Allan Swan said without providing a timeline of when the entire system would be upgraded.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re about to take another leap forward,&#8221; Swan said in a recent interview. &#8220;It&#8217;s kind of exciting from the Panasonic perspective; we&#8217;re driving towards cobalt free and we&#8217;re driving towards higher energy dense batteries, which gives our customers a choice of how they want utilize that.&#8221;</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>The facility where these new battery cells will be produced is known as Gigafactory 1, <span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">a critical component of Tesla&#8217;s plan to expand global battery capacity and reduce the cost of electric vehicles. Panasonic has been its most important partner in that project, which based <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000156459020029536/tsla-8k_20200610.htm\">on a recent agreement</a> should last until at least 2023. </span>Panasonic makes the 2170 cells at Gigafactory 1, which Tesla then uses to make battery packs for the Model 3. The 2170 cells are also used in Tesla&#8217;s newest vehicle, the Model Y.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a quick primer. A battery contains two electrodes. There’s an anode (negative) on one side and a cathode (positive) on the other. An electrolyte sits in the middle and acts as the courier that moves ions between the electrodes when charging and discharging.</p>\n<p>A cell with greater energy density means that engineers figured out a way to pack more energy in that space. The 5% improvement in energy density in the cells should result in the same gains in Tesla&#8217;s battery packs. The upshot: Tesla&#8217;s Model 3 and Model Y could see improvements in range. The reduction in cobalt content, a rare chemical element that is expensive and has social and environmental costs, could also help reduce the price of the cells.</p>\n<p>Panasonic&#8217;s factories in Japan produce the cylindrical lithium-ion “18650” cells, which are used to power Tesla’s Model S and Model X vehicles. Panasonic has already improved 18650 cells, resulting in a reduction in cobalt and improvement in energy density.</p>\n<p>Panasonic uses a NCA, or nickel-cobalt-aluminium, cathode chemistry in its battery cells. Panasonic wouldn&#8217;t disclose the amount of cobalt used today or get into the details of its technology. However, the company did say that the total amount of cobalt used in Panasonic cylindrical automotive batteries is less than 2% of global demand.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">The </span>NCA uses less cobalt than NCM, or nickel manganese cobalt oxide. The NCA cathode chemistry has been further developed to reduce cobalt, according to Panasonic<span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">. </span></p>\n<p>The company is aiming for zero cobalt in its battery cells. Panasonic has already managed that feat in its R&#38;D lab. The<span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\"> plan is to commercialize cobalt-free batteries in a few years.</span></p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=OaBn9APP_Lo:l7M3CWZQXjk:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=OaBn9APP_Lo:l7M3CWZQXjk:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=OaBn9APP_Lo:l7M3CWZQXjk:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=OaBn9APP_Lo:l7M3CWZQXjk:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=OaBn9APP_Lo:l7M3CWZQXjk:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=OaBn9APP_Lo:l7M3CWZQXjk:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=OaBn9APP_Lo:l7M3CWZQXjk:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=OaBn9APP_Lo:l7M3CWZQXjk:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/OaBn9APP_Lo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 30 Jul 2020 10:30:50 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Tesla_Gigafactory_1_-_December_2019.jpg?w=641","linkMd5":"63feaab21d495e4c09212f3fe1b62a07","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn18@2020_1/2020-07-30/1596126034323_2a8e1d8c82500b6a.webp","author":"Kirsten Korosec","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn17@2020_1/2020-07-30/1596126033754_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn42@2020_5/2020-07-30/1596126034995_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn90@2020_1/2020-07-30/1596126033740_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=OaBn9APP_Lo:l7M3CWZQXjk:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn66@2020_4/2020-07-30/1596126033756_69bc1e1d1e424402.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=OaBn9APP_Lo:l7M3CWZQXjk:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn29@2020_2/2020-07-30/1596126033955_2fb2a1e63179f73e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn62@2020_3/2020-07-30/1596126035026_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/OaBn9APP_Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn86@2020_4/2020-07-30/1596126033744_3c3912c69c59cbd6.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-07-31 00:20:26","updatedTime":"2020-07-30 16:20:26","title":"NYC pre-seed powerhouse Notation has a new fund and a new community for founders","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2023884","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">While we often focus on the mega rounds that drive big startup valuations, the reality is that every startup has to start somewhere and find that first check that few to no investors are willing to actually write.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://notation.vc\">Notation</a> though has made that first hurdle its key differentiator.</p>\n<p>Across its first two funds, an $8 million vehicle raised in 2015 and a $28 million second fund with more institutional capital in 2017, the New York City-based firm has been intensely focused on the earliest stage startups: founders thinking about spinning out of companies, engineers with ideas scrawled on whiteboards, product developers with PowerPoints or maybe a workable MVP.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>For the firm’s two GPs, Nick Chirls and <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/person/alex-lines\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"alex-lines\">Alex Lines, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> that stage of a startup’s life was both the most rewarding stage to invest in and where they had the most experience. Formerly, the two had worked at Betaworks, the fund / workspace / incubator / community that has <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2014/05/15/giphy-the-betaworks-backed-gif-search-engine-raising-2-5-million-series-a/\">helped bring companies like Giphy to life</a>.</p>\n<p>Now, with the pandemic in full swing, the duo are tripling down on their thesis.</p>\n<p>The firm announced today the launch of its third fund, a $42 million vehicle that was “closed it in the depths of the coronavirus” according to Chirls. In addition, he highlighted the firm’s first external hire of Katherine Wu as a principal, who officially joined roughly a year ago.</p>\n<p>In addition to investing, she will be launching with Lines and Chirls a new program called Notation Moonlight this September, which is designed as a community of up-and-coming tech leaders who are considering building a company someday.</p>\n<p>Chirls said that while Silicon Valley has a lot of infrastructure in place to help founders go down the path of starting a company, such resources were less prevalent in New York City and other smaller startup ecosystems. With Moonlight, “we want to begin to build that same set of resources and community for folks that are going to start a company but haven&#8217;t yet,” he said.</p>\n<p>Wu noted that more direct outreach through initiatives like Moonlight could help improve the pipeline of founders, particularly from less traditional backgrounds or from under-represented groups. “If we&#8217;re being totally honest in New York City, entrepreneurship and startups, they&#8217;re not as deeply entrenched into everyone&#8217;s minds as [they are] in San Francisco and Silicon Valley,” she said. The goal is to “just give them the tools … essentially bring our network to them.”</p>\n<p>The initial cohort is targeted at somewhere between 15 and 20 potential founders. Moonlight will not take equity, doesn’t require its participants to give up their day jobs, and essentially will act as a decentralized community for participants to talk to one another and think through the steps of fleshing out products, investigate interesting markets and build friendships that can help make the startup experience a little less lonely.</p>\n<p>As for Notation’s new fund, there are some small tweaks. The bulk of the fund will remain devoted to the same geo — New York City — and the same general markets, which include enterprise software and infrastructure, blockchain, and other technical projects. Wu will add a bit more of a consumer flair to the team’s investment interests, and Notation is also intending to invest a small chunk of its fund in smaller startup ecosystems like Boston and Atlanta, where the firm recently made its first investment.</p>\n<p>They are looking at these markets “For all the same reasons we loved New York five years ago — there&#8217;s great talent, there&#8217;s not enough capital, there&#8217;s not enough first check firms,” Chirls explained. That’s a sentiment that every founder can empathize with, and Notation now has even more capital to solve it.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=If35uuWGyJM:131EFDybVmY:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=If35uuWGyJM:131EFDybVmY:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=If35uuWGyJM:131EFDybVmY:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=If35uuWGyJM:131EFDybVmY:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=If35uuWGyJM:131EFDybVmY:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=If35uuWGyJM:131EFDybVmY:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=If35uuWGyJM:131EFDybVmY:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=If35uuWGyJM:131EFDybVmY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/If35uuWGyJM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 30 Jul 2020 13:15:57 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Notation-team-photo-2020-update.jpg?w=599","linkMd5":"2c1e770c837ea43a14abf2c45b320cbb","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn86@2020_3/2020-07-30/1596126033743_9e91bd95761efa78.webp","author":"Danny Crichton","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn17@2020_1/2020-07-30/1596126033754_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn42@2020_5/2020-07-30/1596126034995_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn90@2020_1/2020-07-30/1596126033740_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=If35uuWGyJM:131EFDybVmY:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn34@2020_6/2020-07-30/1596126034935_1073b8f66f7d8801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=If35uuWGyJM:131EFDybVmY:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn42@2020_3/2020-07-30/1596126033743_79fc24be8a722c30.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn62@2020_3/2020-07-30/1596126035026_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/If35uuWGyJM":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn22@2020_2/2020-07-30/1596126033815_c0c1e2b8d24631f6.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-07-31 00:20:26","updatedTime":"2020-07-30 16:20:26","title":"Are option grants promoting gender and racial inequity?","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2023665","description":"<div class=\"article__contributor-byline-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"article__contributor-byline\">\n\t<div class=\"contributor-byline__contributor\">\n\t\t<div class=\"byline__author\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"byline__author-name\">Stephen Ratner</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"byline__author-title\" style=\"display: block;\">Contributor</span>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"contributor__twitter\">\n\t\t\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/StephenRatner\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<svg class=\"icon icon--twitter icon--white\" viewBox=\"0 0 20 20\" version=\"1.1\" aria-labelledby=\"title\">\n\t\t<title>Share on Twitter</title>\n\t\t<path d=\"M20,4c-0.7,0.3-1.5,0.6-2.4,0.7c0.9-0.5,1.5-1.4,1.8-2.3c-0.8,0.5-1.7,0.8-2.6,1C16.1,2.5,15,2,13.8,2c-2.3,0-4.1,1.9-4.1,4.2c0,0.3,0,0.7,0.1,1C6.4,7,3.4,5.4,1.4,2.9C1,3.5,0.8,4.1,0.8,4.9c0,1.4,0.7,2.7,1.8,3.5C2,8.4,1.4,8.2,0.8,7.9v0.1c0,2,1.4,3.7,3.3,4.1c-0.4,0.1-0.7,0.2-1.1,0.2c-0.3,0-0.5,0-0.8-0.1c0.5,1.7,2,2.9,3.8,2.9c-1.4,1.1-3.2,2-5.1,2c-0.3,0-0.7,0-1-0.1c1.8,1.2,4,1.7,6.3,1.7c7.5,0,11.7-6.4,11.7-12V6.1C18.8,5.6,19.4,4.8,20,4z\"/>\t</svg>\n\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t<div class=\"contributor-byline__bio\">\n\t\tStephen Ratner is a startup attorney who has advised emerging companies and venture funds.

But how much progress has actually been made? Are companies even aware that upcoming stock option grants might worsen the very problem they claim to be fixing?</p>\n<p>Last week, a top female executive at well-known equity management platform <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/eshares\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"eshares\">Carta <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> resigned, alleging hypocrisy in the company&#8217;s public advertisements for equity compensation &#8212; or the now infamous statement by their CEO &#8220;Fair equity should be table stakes&#8221; &#8212; and their actual stance on correcting these wrongs within the company. This top executive was <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/person/emily-kramer-2\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"emily-kramer-2\">Emily Kramer, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> the very Harvard MBA brought on board in part to help improve stock option inequity at Carta and within its thousands of company users. These developments left me wondering what more can be done by leaders in equity management to help ameliorate these issues before they get harder to solve.</p>\n<p>Anyone who&#8217;s worked closely to venture capital and tech in America knows that stock options are a key lever of attracting top talent, especially for companies with risky business models and low odds of success. Yet, equity compensation has received much less attention than cash pay. Further, this &#8220;paper wealth&#8221; can be invaluable to women and persons of color as the country attempts to attack its shameful income inequality. If you&#8217;ve had the opportunity to work with Carta, then you also know that gender and racial inequity in compensation exists with stock options too, not just cash.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>Carta must act swiftly to implement a new feature across its entire platform: an alert to startup founders and legal administrators that upcoming option grants result in gender and racial inequity, when compared with the rest of the company&#8217;s employees doing similar work. Backed by the precept of &#8220;equal work, equal pay,&#8221; Carta has a unique opportunity to use its near informational monopoly to ameliorate &#8220;equity inequity&#8221; and make good on unkept promises. This feature ensures internal parity: that women and persons of color are compensated by equity grants on par with white and/or male colleagues performing the same work, in similar positions.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"llzDJDziNW\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/21/cartas-former-marketing-vp-who-spearheaded-its-report-on-pay-inequality-is-suing-over-gender-discrimination/\">Carta&#8217;s former marketing VP is suing over gender discrimination after spearheading report on unequal pay</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Carta&#8217;s former marketing VP is suing over gender discrimination after spearheading report on unequal pay&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/21/cartas-former-marketing-vp-who-spearheaded-its-report-on-pay-inequality-is-suing-over-gender-discrimination/embed/#?secret=llzDJDziNW\" data-secret=\"llzDJDziNW\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>Having input equity compensation into Carta myself as a startup attorney, there&#8217;s no way I could have known if new grants were equitable across the capitalization table, unless Carta sent an alert or the company circulated its own report. The sad reality is that it&#8217;s way too challenging to independently perform this review on your own. Carta can because it&#8217;s a clearinghouse for equity compensation, used by more than 14,000 companies across the marketplace, with unique access to the tools and information required to know if a company&#8217;s astray from its stated values.</p>\n<p>Wouldn&#8217;t it be helpful if Carta notified a client&#8217;s management team and lawyers that new grants didn&#8217;t achieve gender and racial equity while they still had a chance to adjust the numbers, before board grants? According to <a href=\"https://carta.com/blog/table-stakes/\">Carta&#8217;s own 2019 gender equity gap study</a> published following a review of a sample of their own users&#8217; capitalization tables, male founders represented 6.5% of equity holders but own 64% of all equity. Further, at the employee level, female employees own 49 cents in equity for every dollar men own. If companies affirmatively understood the gravity of their actions, the state of paper wealth in the United States would be far more equitable and inclusive.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d imagine social justice-minded companies would be happy to make adjustments to stock grants when it was easiest, not after the fact. After all, once options are granted by the board, it becomes an administrative hassle to redo. Yes, many companies do internal audits afterwards, uncovering inequities &#8212; but it&#8217;s usually too late or burdensome to make all of these employees whole, some of whom might have already departed. Let&#8217;s not forget that startups generally can&#8217;t even grant options to individuals no longer providing services to their company. A proactive, preemptive approach is not only reasonable, but required. Carta&#8217;s well-placed to make up for its broken promises by nudging users to get it right the first time.</p>\n<p>Remember, later-stage companies have the money to perform comprehensive equity pay analysis, but early-stage companies often don&#8217;t. It&#8217;s at formation when inequities are easiest and cheapest to tackle, particularly for the promising early-stage, future unicorns that Carta spends so much time attracting in its successful Launch program &#8212; one that offers discounted services to retain startups as they grow. Attorneys, board members, startup operators &#8212; heck, even the most junior staff &#8212; need to be unafraid in using Carta as a tool to help bring these issues to light.</p>\n<p>I want to believe that companies that promise racial and gender equity in compensation make it happen, but not all do. Some don&#8217;t care. But others are just overloaded with pitch decks, Slack notifications and the immense expectations of investors searching for big returns. It&#8217;s not an excuse, just a reality. What a difference it would make if Carta let management know of the problem before it was too widespread to fix.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=VTqI9rz6oSk:Hi8uMRBAMbA:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=VTqI9rz6oSk:Hi8uMRBAMbA:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=VTqI9rz6oSk:Hi8uMRBAMbA:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=VTqI9rz6oSk:Hi8uMRBAMbA:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=VTqI9rz6oSk:Hi8uMRBAMbA:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=VTqI9rz6oSk:Hi8uMRBAMbA:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=VTqI9rz6oSk:Hi8uMRBAMbA:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=VTqI9rz6oSk:Hi8uMRBAMbA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/VTqI9rz6oSk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 30 Jul 2020 15:03:18 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GettyImages-dv1322002.jpg?w=764","linkMd5":"9fafe96eec3dda4afe1f1082666ff65c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn82@2020_1/2020-07-30/1596126033763_9ce4c8b5cf6f85ee.webp","author":"Walter Thompson","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn17@2020_1/2020-07-30/1596126033754_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn42@2020_5/2020-07-30/1596126034995_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn90@2020_1/2020-07-30/1596126033740_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=VTqI9rz6oSk:Hi8uMRBAMbA:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn50@2020_1/2020-07-30/1596126035106_edc63d88fa7cd021.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=VTqI9rz6oSk:Hi8uMRBAMbA:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn41@2020_4/2020-07-30/1596126034829_85ddde7d02c8df0d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn62@2020_3/2020-07-30/1596126035026_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/VTqI9rz6oSk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn74@2020_4/2020-07-30/1596126033835_02ead1fea5e57e73.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-07-31 00:20:26","updatedTime":"2020-07-30 16:20:26","title":"Four keys to building your startup","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2023523","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">At last week&#8217;s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-sf-2020/\">Early Stage virtual event</a>, founders and investors shared some of their best insights about startup building and what they&#8217;re looking for in their next investments.

But the concept was hardly the household word it is today; The ML techniques we&#8217;ve come to rely on in practically every domain were then quite primitive by comparison, yet to many a forward-thinking mind clearly a tool with immense promise.</p>\n<p>Leaving in 2012 to join Andrew Ng in founding one of the original MOOC platforms, Coursera, Koller temporarily left behind the world of computational biology. Four years later, however, she left Coursera to head up computing efforts at Google&#8217;s health R&#38;D arm, Calico. Her work here clearly inspired to go her own way in 2018 and — with the blessing of GV and others to the tune of $100M — <a href=\"https://medium.com/@daphne_38275/insitro-rethinking-drug-discovery-using-machine-learning-dcb0371870ee\">found Insitro</a>.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>The cost of developing new drugs can reach into the billions, making it impractical for pharmaceutical companies to pursue them in cases where the population affected by the treated condition is not large enough.

As for the iPhone users, the costs for consumers to switch from an iPhone to an Android is so high that it qualifies as a monopolistic lock-in&#8221; &#8212; citing a <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3606073\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">study </a>done by Yale University to bolster that claim.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Now that anti-monopoly investigations against Apple have started in the EU and the US, I expect Apple to double down on spreading such myths,&#8221; Durov adds. &#8220;We shouldn’t sit idly and let Apple’s lobbyists and PR agents do their thing. At the end of the day, it is up to us – consumers and creators – to defend our rights and to stop monopolists from stealing our money. They may think they have tricked us into a deadlock, because we’ve already bought a critical mass of their devices and created a critical mass of apps for them. But we shouldn’t be giving them a free ride any longer.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/european-commission\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"european-commission\">European Commission <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> declined to comment on Telegram&#8217;s complaint.</p>\n<p>We also reached out to Apple for comment but the company also declined to provide an on the record statement regarding Telegram&#8217;s complaint. A spokesperson did point to a piece of <a href=\"https://www.idc.com/promo/smartphone-market-share/os\">analyst research</a>, from earlier this year, which found iOS had a marketshare of 15% vs Android&#8217;s 85%. They also flagged a <a href=\"https://www.analysisgroup.com/globalassets/insights/publishing/apples_app_store_and_other_digital_marketplaces_a_comparison_of_commission_rates.pdf\">separate analyst report</a>, which looks at commission rates charged by app and digital content stores and marketplaces &#8212; suggesting this shows that rates charged for similar types of stores are generally also around 30%.</p>\n<p>So the company&#8217;s overarching argument against &#8216;app tax&#8217; complaints continues to be the claim that: A) Apple can&#8217;t have monopoly power, given its relatively small mobile OS marketshare (vs Android); and B) the App Store fee is fair because it&#8217;s basically the same as everyone else charges. (On the latter point it&#8217;s true Google also takes a 30% cut via the Play Store. However the Android platform lets users sideload apps; whereas, on iOS, users would have to jailbreak their device to get the same level of freedom to freely install apps of their choice).</p>\n<p>Apple&#8217;s arguments are also now being actively looked into by EU regulators. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/16/apple-pay-and-ios-app-store-under-formal-antitrust-probe-in-europe/\">Last month</a> the Competition Commission announced it&#8217;s investigating Apple&#8217;s iOS store (and Apple Pay) &#8212; saying a preliminary probe of the store had identified concerns related to conditions and restrictions applied by the tech giant.</p>\n<p>Specifically vis-a-vis the App Store, the Commission said it&#8217;s looking at Apple’s mandatory requirement that developers use its proprietary in-app purchase system, and at restrictions it applies on the ability of developers to inform iPhone and iPad users of alternative cheaper purchasing possibilities outside of the App Store.</p>\n<p>The investigation by EU regulators is just the latest in a series of major big tech antitrust probes under the bloc&#8217;s current competition chief, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/person/margrethe-vestager\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"margrethe-vestager\">Margrethe Vestager <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> &#8212; who has also been digging into <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/17/europe-is-now-formally-investigating-amazons-use-of-merchant-data/\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/06/facebooks-use-of-onavo-spyware-faces-questions-in-eu-antitrust-probe-report/\">Facebook</a> business practices in recent years, as well as hitting Google with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/20/google-fined-1-49bn-in-europe-for-antitrust-violations-in-search-ad-brokering/\">a series</a> of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/27/google-fined-e2-42bn-for-eu-antitrust-violations-over-shopping-searches/\">record-breaking</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/18/google-gets-slapped-5bn-by-eu-for-android-antitrust-abuse/\">antitrust fines</a>.</p>\n<p>Over in the US, meanwhile, lawmakers are also actively grappling with competition concerns that have long been attached to a number of tech giants &#8212; and are being exacerbated by the pandemic concentrating platform power. Apple is one of the tech giants of concern, though not, seemingly, top of US lawmakers&#8217; target list.</p>\n<p>Yesterday, a hearing of the House Antitrust Subcommittee took testimony from four big tech CEOs: Amazon&#8217;s <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/person/jeff-bezos\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"jeff-bezos\">Jeff Bezos, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> Apple&#8217;s Tim Cook, Facebook&#8217;s Mark Zuckerberg and Google&#8217;s <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/person/sundar-pichai\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"sundar-pichai\">Sundar Pichai <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> &#8212; with Pichai, Bezos and Zuckerberg getting the most questions from lawmakers.</p>\n<p>Cook did face a number of questions around how the company operates the App Store, though &#8212; including about the commission it charges developers and a specific line of enquiry on <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/29/apple-ceo-tim-cook-questioned-over-app-stores-removal-of-rival-screen-time-apps-in-antitrust-hearing/\">why it had removed rival screen time apps</a>. Asked whether Apple could ever raise its 30% take on app subscriptions Cook sought to sidestep the question, saying the fee had remained unchanged since the launch of the store.</p>\n<p>He then followed up by arguing Apple faces huge competition for developers &#8212; citing alternatives platforms such as Windows and Xbox as also fiercely vying for developers, and likening the competition to attract developers as akin to &#8220;a street fight for market share&#8221;.</p>\n<p>The contention from complainants like <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/spotify\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"spotify\">Spotify <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> and Telegram is that Cook&#8217;s claim of Apple facing fierce competition for developers&#8217; wares, from its position as the world&#8217;s second largest smartphone OS by marketshare, does not stand up to scrutiny. But it&#8217;ll be up to EU regulators to determine how to define the market for smartphone apps and, flowing from that, whether they identify harm or not.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=3ut6FRJ3P9w:DIb0YE878Lg:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=3ut6FRJ3P9w:DIb0YE878Lg:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=3ut6FRJ3P9w:DIb0YE878Lg:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=3ut6FRJ3P9w:DIb0YE878Lg:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=3ut6FRJ3P9w:DIb0YE878Lg:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=3ut6FRJ3P9w:DIb0YE878Lg:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=3ut6FRJ3P9w:DIb0YE878Lg:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=3ut6FRJ3P9w:DIb0YE878Lg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/3ut6FRJ3P9w\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 30 Jul 2020 14:28:04 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/butcher-pavel-durov-5.jpg?w=600","linkMd5":"72c7ebb3968ebcb5b84ea611c11d8b0c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn98@2020_5/2020-07-30/1596126033764_332dc20eb90468e4.webp","author":"Natasha Lomas","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn17@2020_1/2020-07-30/1596126033754_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn42@2020_5/2020-07-30/1596126034995_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn90@2020_1/2020-07-30/1596126033740_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=3ut6FRJ3P9w:DIb0YE878Lg:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn69@2020_4/2020-07-30/1596126034671_5a82f619566e283a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=3ut6FRJ3P9w:DIb0YE878Lg:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn46@2020_1/2020-07-30/1596126035172_adfab163ddf71374.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn62@2020_3/2020-07-30/1596126035026_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/3ut6FRJ3P9w":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn9@2020_2/2020-07-30/1596126033746_b218a2de3bdda5cc.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-07-31 00:20:26","updatedTime":"2020-07-30 16:20:26","title":"China’s electric SUV maker Li Auto raises $1.1 billion in U.S. IPO","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2024900","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Trade tensions between China and the U.S. have not stopped Chinese companies from eyeing to list on American stock exchanges.

Its first model, sold at a subsidized price of 328,000 yuan or $46,800, is a six-seat electric SUV that began shipping end of last year.</p>\n<p>Li Auto priced its IPO <a href=\"https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/69932/Chinese-EV-maker-Li-Auto-prices-US-IPO-above-the-range-at-$11.50\">north of its targeted range</a> at $11.5 per share, giving it a fully diluted market value of $10 billion. It also raised an additional $380 million in a concurrent private placement of shares to existing investors.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>The IPO arrived amid a surge of investor interest in EV makers. <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/tesla-motors\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"tesla-motors\">Tesla&#8217;s <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> shares <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/14/tesla-holds-onto-to-recent-gains-with-bullish-analyst-target-of-2300/\">have skyrocketed</a> in the last few quarters. Li Auto&#8217;s domestic rival Nio, which raised a similar amount in a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/13/nio-makes-bumpy-start/\">$1 billion float</a> in New York back in 2018, also saw its stock price <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/30/china-based-nios-shares-skyrocket-as-the-tesla-rival-beats-investor-expectations/\">rally</a> in recent months.</p>\n<p>Li Auto is one step ahead of its Chinese peer Xpeng in planning its first-time sale.

Last month, a source <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/tech/start-ups/article/3087121/chinas-tesla-challenger-xpeng-said-be-preparing-us-listing-countrys\">told</a> South China Morning Post that Xpeng was getting ready for the listing.</p>\n<p>Founders of China&#8217;s emergent EV startups are often shrewd internet veterans who are well-connected in the venture capital and marketing world, attracting investment dollars in the billions. Li Auto, for instance, counts China&#8217;s food delivery mogul Wang Xing, boss of Meituan Dianping, as its second-largest shareholder after its CEO Li Xiang. TikTok parent ByteDance shelled out <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1791706/000104746920004077/a2241802zf-1.htm\">$30 million</a> in its Series C round.</p>\n<p>Investors are in part emboldened by Beijing&#8217;s national push to electrify China&#8217;s auto industry. The question, then, is whether these startups have the right talent and resources to pull things off in an industry that traditionally demands a much longer development cycle.</p>\n<p>Wallace Guo, a managing partner at Li Auto&#8217;s Series B investor Taihecap, admitted that &#8220;the nature of auto consumption, unlike internet products evolving through trial and error, manufacturing a car, is a strategic move with sophisticated system, very long value chain, requiring huge investment and resources and any error can be fatal.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Mingming Huang, chief executive of Future Capital, said that &#8220;it was a no brainer in 2015 to be the first investor&#8221; in Li Auto. The venture capitalist said Li, who ran a popular car-buying online portal before getting into manufacturing, &#8220;has the rare combination of being a relentless talent as well as a top-notch product manager that excels in creating value for all stakeholders.&#8221;</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2024903\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2024903\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2024903\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/li-auto-2.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"454\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/li-auto-2.jpg 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/li-auto-2.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/li-auto-2.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/li-auto-2.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/li-auto-2.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/li-auto-2.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2024903\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Customers testing Li Auto&#8217;s SUV in China.

The startup only began shipping its first model last December and delivered just over 10,000 units as of June, its <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1791706/000104746920004077/a2241802zf-1.htm\">prospectus</a> showed.</p>\n<p>The startup is still deep in the red, losing 2.44 billion yuan ($350 million) in 2019, up from a net loss of 1.53 billion yuan in 2018.

If you are particularly active in any given month, that can result in a hefty bill at the end of the month. That leads to limiting what you choose to monitor to control costs. <a href=\"https://newrelic.com/\">New Relic</a> wants to change that, and today it announced that it&#8217;s moving to a model where customers pay by the user instead with a smaller less costly data component.</p>\n<p>The company is also simplifying its product set with the goal of encouraging customers to instrument everything instead of deciding what to monitor and what to leave out to control cost. &#8220;What we&#8217;re announcing is a completely reimagined platform. We&#8217;re simplifying our products from 11 to three, and we eliminate those barriers to standardizing on a single source of truth,&#8221; <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/new-relic\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"new-relic\">New Relic <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> founder and CEO Lew Cirne told TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>The way the company can afford to make this switch is by exposing the underlying telemetry database that it created to run its own products. By taking advantage of this database to track all of your APM, tracing and metric data all in one place, Cirne says they can control costs much better and pass those savings onto customers, whose bills should be much smaller based on a this new pricing model, he said.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>&#8220;Prior to this, there has not been any technology that&#8217;s good at gathering all of those data types into a single database, what we would call a telemetry database. And we actually created one ourselves and it&#8217;s the backbone of all of our products. [Up until now], we haven&#8217;t really exposed it to our customers, so that they can put all their data into it,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2024937\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2024937\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2024937\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Telemetry-Data-Platform-Metrics.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"383\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Telemetry-Data-Platform-Metrics.png 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Telemetry-Data-Platform-Metrics.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Telemetry-Data-Platform-Metrics.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Telemetry-Data-Platform-Metrics.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Telemetry-Data-Platform-Metrics.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Telemetry-Data-Platform-Metrics.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Telemetry-Data-Platform-Metrics.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Telemetry-Data-Platform-Metrics.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2024937\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">New Relic Telemetry Data.

The first is the Telemetry Data Platform, which offers a single way to gather any events, logs or traces, whether from their agents or someone else&#8217;s or even open source monitoring tools like Prometheus.</p>\n<p>The second product is called Full-stack Observability. This includes all of their previous products, which were sold separately such as APM, mobility, infrastructure and logging. Finally they are offering an intelligence layer called New Relic AI.</p>\n<p>Cirne says by simplifying the product set and changing the way they bill, it will save customers money through the efficiencies they have uncovered. In practice he says, pricing will consist of a combination of users and data, but he believes their approach will result in much lower bills and more cost certainty for customers.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll vary by customer so this is just a rough estimate but imagine that the typical New Relic bill under this model will be a 70% per user charge and 30% data charge, roughly, but so if that&#8217;s the case, and if you look at our competitors, 100% of the bill is data,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>The new approach is available starting today.

This rover, a successor to the Curiosity robotic explorer, is equipped with sensors specifically designed to help it hopefully fund evidence of ancient, microbiotic life on Mars.</p>\n<p>Mars 2020 departed from Cape Canaveral in Florida at 7:50 AM EDT (4:50 PM PDT). Perseverance was loaded atop a United Launch Alliance (ULA) Atlas V rocket, which had a good liftoff and deployed its second stage which put the spacecraft into a parking orbit as it readies to depart on its trip towards Mars, which will see it arrive in February 2021.</p>\n<p>Once at Mars, the lander vehicle will take Perseverance down to the planet&#8217;s surface on February 18, 2021, to a target landing zone found in what&#8217;s known as Jezero Crater. This location on Mars was once a lake, long ago when the atmosphere on Mars was quite different than the dry, dusty and cold environment we know today. This has been chosen specifically because it&#8217;s a prime spot for finding any evidence of microbiological life that might exist, since it contains one of the best-preserved deposits of a river delta on Mars.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>NASA scientists don&#8217;t expect to be able to confirm the existence of life on Mars using the instruments on Perseverance, however – they think they can find strong indications that the conditions and materials necessary for life once existed, but the ultimate proof could come from the ambitious Mars sample return mission being planned for 2026. This would involve NASA launching a return rocket to the red planet, which will carry a rocket that can take off from the Mars surface with samples collected by Perseverance on board. That would then meet up with a rover to be launched by the European Space Agency (<a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/esa\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"esa\">ESA) <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> which would then make the trip all the way back to Earth for scientists to study.</p>\n<p>In addition to its contained, radioactive nuclear battery power source, environment sensors, cameras and a suite of other instruments to help pick up any preserved evidence of ancient life, Perseverance is equipped with microphones. This is the first time that microphones are making the trip to the surface of another world, and it means we could hear what it sounds like on the surface of another world, something we&#8217;ve never done before.</p>\n<p>Perseverance also carries the Mars Ingenuity helicopter, a small drone designed for first-ever self-powered flight, which is also designed to warm itself to survive the cold Martian night. It is set to hopefully make up to five flights in 30 days, could include color photos – the first ever taken from an aerial vantage point.</p>\n<p>This is a great first step for this historic Mars 2020 mission, and now we&#8217;ll wait and watch for other significant milestones, including next in around two weeks when the spacecraft fires its engines for its departure from Earth&#8217;s orbit and begins the long trip to Mars.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=gExUMqZZ57A:3B7rSYG16Xg:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=gExUMqZZ57A:3B7rSYG16Xg:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=gExUMqZZ57A:3B7rSYG16Xg:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=gExUMqZZ57A:3B7rSYG16Xg:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=gExUMqZZ57A:3B7rSYG16Xg:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=gExUMqZZ57A:3B7rSYG16Xg:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=gExUMqZZ57A:3B7rSYG16Xg:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=gExUMqZZ57A:3B7rSYG16Xg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/gExUMqZZ57A\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 30 Jul 2020 11:55:53 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/nasa-mars-2020-launch.gif?w=726","linkMd5":"3ed937be35f085552a70132a26c16dc6","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn90@2020_5/2020-07-30/1596126171417_0c632ca85490eeb4.webp","author":"Darrell Etherington","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn17@2020_1/2020-07-30/1596126033754_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn42@2020_5/2020-07-30/1596126034995_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn90@2020_1/2020-07-30/1596126033740_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=gExUMqZZ57A:3B7rSYG16Xg:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn74@2020_3/2020-07-30/1596126035250_d7c15beecc975571.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=gExUMqZZ57A:3B7rSYG16Xg:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn38@2020_3/2020-07-30/1596126033919_9a12a7b0fc4fa038.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn62@2020_3/2020-07-30/1596126035026_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/gExUMqZZ57A":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn89@2020_3/2020-07-30/1596126034845_071645754de503f5.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-07-31 00:20:26","updatedTime":"2020-07-30 16:20:26","title":"What’s ahead for no-code and low-code startups?","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2024926","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Since <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/army-air-force-exchange-service\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"army-air-force-exchange-service\">The Exchange <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> last <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/21/tracking-the-growth-of-low-code-no-code-startups/\">checked in on the world of low- and no-code startup funding</a>, several more interesting rounds in the niche have bubbled up.</p>\n<p>This week, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/28/hevo-draws-in-8-million-series-a-for-its-no-code-data-pipeline-service/\">TechCrunch covered a startup</a> called <a href=\"https://hevodata.com/\">Hevo</a> raising $8 million, and <a href=\"https://useparagon.com/\">Paragon</a>, which raised <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/28/yc-alum-paragon-snags-2-5m-seed-for-low-code-app-integration-platform/\">a $2.5 million seed round</a>.

While Point is technically providing a bank account, the company focuses on rewards associated with a debit card.</p>\n<p>“I started Point as a solution about everything that is frustrating and complicated about credit cards. The incentives between credit card companies and cardholders are misaligned,” Point co-founder and CEO Patrick Mrozowski told me.</p>\n<p>When Mrozowski first got a credit card, he was spending a ton of money to reach a certain level of spending and unlock the sign-up bonus. At the end of the month, he ended up with credit card debt for no valid reason.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>“What would American Express would look like today?” he says to sum up Point’s vision. It comes down to two important principles — being in charge of your budget so that you don’t end up with debt and unlocking rewards from brands that you actually interact with.</p>\n<p>Many challenger banks want to provide a simple banking experience for the underbanked. Point doesn’t have the same positioning. Creating a Point account is more like joining a membership program.</p>\n<p>When you sign up, you get a debit card with some level of insurance as it’s a Mastercard World Debit card. You can expect some trip cancellation insurance, rental car insurance, purchase insurance, etc.</p>\n<p>As the name of the startup suggests, you earn points with each purchase. You get 5x points on subscriptions, such as Spotify and Netflix, 3x points on food, grocery deliveries and ride sharing, and 1x points on everything else. Points can be redeemed for dollars — each point is worth $0.01. In addition to that, Point is going to create a feed of offers with discounts, content, events and more.</p>\n<p>Due to its premium positioning, Point isn’t free. You have to pay $6.99 per month or $60 per year to join Point. Point doesn’t charge any foreign transaction fees.</p>\n<p>You can connect your Point account with another bank account using Plaid. It lets you top up your account using ACH transfers. Behind the scene, Point works with Radius Bank for the banking infrastructure, an FDIC-insured bank.</p>\n<p>The company announced <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/01/point-launches-new-challenger-bank-with-rewards-on-debit-card-purchases/\">earlier this month</a> that it has raised a $10.5 million Series A led by Valar

Processes are being digitized across workplace verticals but there&#8217;s plenty of room for improvement in bringing security and compliance standards into the remote-work age. </span></p>\n<p>&#8220;All the security [and] compliance while being remote is still largely untapped as companies are figuring out the answer,&#8221; said Techstars&#8217; Cazalot, to pick one quote from a few.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other items that popped up include front-of-office collaboration and personal remote process automation. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once basic communications are sorted, the sorts of tools and services that folks-at-a-distance need to work well both alone and and as a team will be varied.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It would be simple to presume that a growing library of apps and services would lead to software (SaaS) fatigue, but our VC group isn’t too worried about the concept.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then there was the talk concerning economics and fundraising. TechCrunch wanted to know if remote-work startups have better or worse economics than other startups that are delivered along similar channels (SaaS, etc.). Our summary of answers it that their economics are at least as good, with some exceptions that their performance could in fact be <em>better </em>than other groupings of their business-model peers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regardless, the wave of companies hunting up new apps and services to fuel and empower their suddenly remote workforce is driving venture interest in the companies welcoming the demand. But notable is that prices, per our collected investors, are not as wild as you might think. Bessemer’s Robinson said prices were not low (&#8220;growth equity investors are paying high multiples to get a shot at the category defining [remote work-focused] app companies&#8221;), but most others offered some more tempered notes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reading their answers, it appears that the further an investor is from the Silicon Valley startup hub, the more reasonable prices look; that was likely true before the pandemic, mind, but that the pattern is holding up during COVID-19 implies that there is available price arbitrage available in the market that persists even into this hot niche.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That’s our first read, but there’s a lot more below.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Minn Kim, </b><b>investor, Bloomberg Beta</b></h2>\n<h2><b style=\"font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">It’s now common knowledge that the digital transformation has been accelerated by COVID-19. What portion of your active portfolio benefits from this change in pace?</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Given our firm’s focus on the future of work, we’ve observed that a little over half of our portfolio companies have benefited from the digital transformation accelerated by COVID-19. These have been in areas like digital productivity, security, developer collaboration tools, network infrastructure and online education. This is also because several of our portfolio companies were built with a remote workforce in mind, including coaching platform</span><a href=\"https://www.soundingboardinc.com/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sounding Board</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and team success software</span><a href=\"https://www.range.co/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Range</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.  </span></p>\n<p><b>Will the influx of single-purpose remote-work apps and services lead to app fatigue, and thus a return of more bundled solutions?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For those of us fortunate enough to do most of our work online, the rise of single-purpose remote-work apps reflects the limitations of the tools that we relied on in our previous “work stack.” If there is new bundling, I believe we may see it on platforms we’re newly relying on heavily, such as those offering great ways to run online sprints, remote offsites, and collaborative screen sharing.  </span></p>\n<p><b>Is there an upper limit to the number of tools that a single company may want to buy? Put another way, is SaaS fatigue real?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An upper limit for tool purchasing is more likely indication that a product is not yet hitting on the most important priority for its customer at the right time or price. SaaS fatigue is real until a solution comes along that addresses the user’s pain point in a clear, compelling and differentiated way. </span></p>\n<p><b>As companies begin to go back to the office, do you think they are going to trend back toward their old processes and ditch some of their new remote software?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For knowledge work, I believe some behaviors will naturally default back to old processes, such as in-person water cooler conversations in a shared common space. Even when companies begin to go back to the office, I imagine some people on our teams will continue to be remote, at least for awhile. With this in mind, I foresee an ongoing reliance on tools like</span><a href=\"http://www.pinpoint.com/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pinpoint</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, for helping software engineers collaborate more efficiently, and</span><a href=\"https://bonus.ly/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bonusly</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, for ongoing encouragement and recognition to team members (in-person and remote).</span></p>\n<p><b>Are there areas inside of the world of remote tools and services that you think are under-served, places where you’d like to place a bet?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’d love to see more founders building solutions around lightweight automations (“personal RPA”), software for better decision-making and products that use digital nudges to make unstructured collaboration more effective, such as gesture recognition or sentiment notifications in video conversations. There are also many opportunities to build useful products that use the metadata in our online interactions to help us become more effective teammates. For example, we’re investors in a company called</span><a href=\"https://cultivate.com/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cultivate</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that analyzes a team’s digital conversations to help leaders improve and get notified when they’re sending too many emails during evening hours or sharing recognition unevenly across a team. </span></p>\n<p><b>Does the availability of ample private capital give remote-tooling startups the flexibility to put off going up-market to the mid-market and enterprise areas?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s less about the flexibility of delaying moving up-market. It’s more about the freedom to experiment, iterate and get a product closer to product-market-fit with its earliest representative customer segment. </span></p>\n<p><b>Do remote-tooling-focused startups have similar, better or worse economics than the average venture-backed SaaS startup?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This answer will vary depending on what you’re comparing. Because many of the newer remote-tooling-focused companies offer freemium business models to encourage new users, the sustainability of a company comes down to the cost to serve each new customer. We’ve seen that remote-tooling-focused startups that are laser-focused on a specific use case and narrow the pool of potential early customers are often in a better position to understand their unit economics. </span></p>\n<p><b>How competitive are remote-work tooling venture rounds now? Are prices out of control?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It feels like the right time to build and raise for a Zoom competitor was at the beginning of 2020. Now, we’re seeing competitive rounds for companies building on top of Zoom or around workflow-specific features, such as event and community management or meeting analytics. That said, prices at the pre-seed and seed stages haven’t changed dramatically since pre-Covid-19. </span></p>\n<h2><b>Elliott Robinson, growth equity partner, Bessemer<div

href=\"https://blog.bolt.io/business-models-that-matter/#.vt766k3ck\">hardware-enabled service</a> (Haas) model works: Peloton, Particle, Latch and Igloohome all rely on subscriptions along with product sales. Even tech giants like Apple are rapidly reinventing themselves as service companies.</p>\n<p>Yet, if you currently rely on device sales, the prospect of changing your entire business model might seem daunting.</p>\n<p>At <a href=\"http://www.minut.com/\">Minut</a>, we are building smart home monitors (privacy-safe noise, motion and temperature monitoring) and recently made the transition despite the lack of resources on the process. Here are the seven lessons we learned:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It is a question of when  —  not if.</li>\n<li>The transition will have company-wide impact.</li>\n<li>Your current and future target audience may differ.</li>\n<li>Price should reflect the value for the customer. Your revenue should grow with theirs.</li>\n<li>Avoid your free offer competing with your premium ones.</li>\n<li>Be transparent (internally and externally) about the changes. Over-communicate.</li>\n<li>Start the process early, check regularly with your team and set measurable targets.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Why subscriptions are the future of industry (and your startup)</h2>\n<p>Hardware has one advantage over software: customers understand there is a cost to your product. Now, this allows hardware startups to generate revenue with their first iteration, but it’s unsustainable as the company grows and needs to innovate: the software and user experience need continuous improvement and excellent support, just like in a software-only startup.</p>\n<p>That’s why we see most hardware startups eventually launching a subscription model and limit what’s available for free. Even established companies  —  think <a href=\"https://www.strava.com/subscription/from-our-founders?btn=3CsWNID93C1n7iSSUN2fF9&#38;par=2Cz72Oq21soUqJdXTZpItl\">Strava</a> or <a href=\"https://blog.wink.com/wink-blog/2020/5/6/introducing-wink-subscription\">Wink</a>  —  often end up having to radically limit free features after years of operations.</p>\n<p>Experienced founders and financial markets favor subscription models and recurring revenue.

more than 300,000 congregations in the U.S., and entrepreneurs are creating billion-dollar companies by building software to service them. Welcome to church tech.</p>\n<p>The sector was growing prior to COVID-19, but the pandemic forced many congregations to go entirely online, which rapidly accelerated growth in this space. While many of these companies were bootstrapped, VC dollars are also increasingly flowing in. Unfortunately, it&#8217;s hard to come across a lot of resources covering this expanding, unique sector.</p>\n<h2>Market map</h2>\n<p>In broad terms, we can split church tech into six categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>church management software (ChMS)</li>\n<li>digital giving</li>\n<li>member outreach/messaging</li>\n<li>streaming/content</li>\n<li>Bible study</li>\n<li>website and app building</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Horizontal integration is huge in this sector, and nearly all the companies operating in this space fall into several of these categories. Many have expanded through M&#38;A.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2024180\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2024180\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2024180\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Church_market_map.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"929\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Church_market_map.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Church_market_map.jpg?resize=150,136 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Church_market_map.jpg?resize=300,272 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Church_market_map.jpg?resize=768,697 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Church_market_map.jpg?resize=680,617 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Church_market_map.jpg?resize=1536,1393 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Church_market_map.jpg?resize=50,45 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2024180\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href=\"https://contrarycap.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Contrary Capital <span class=\"screen-reader-text\">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>\n<h2>The categories</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Church management software:</strong> Almost all are SaaS businesses, mostly using cloud hosting.

That includes data collected from its Amazon.com retail storefront, Amazon Echo devices and its Kindle and Fire tablets.</p>\n<p>Breaking those figures down, Amazon said it received:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2,416 subpoenas, turning over all of partial user data in 70% of cases;</li>\n<li>543 search warrants, turning over all of partial user data in 79% of cases;</li>\n<li>146 court orders, turning over all of partial user data in 74% of cases.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The number of requests to the company&#8217;s cloud services, Amazon Web Services, also went up compared to a year earlier.</p>\n<p>But it&#8217;s not clear what caused the rise in U.S. government demands for user data. A spokesperson for Amazon did respond to a request for comment.</p>\n<p>But the company saw the number of overseas requests drop by about one-third compared to the same period a year earlier. Amazon rejected 92% of the 177 overseas requests it received, turning over partial user data in 10 cases and all requested data in four cases.</p>\n<p>Amazon also said it received between 0 and 249 national security requests, flat from previous reports.
