In the movie, three friends create a board game that they hope will lead them to success. It doesn&#8217;t work out – which leads the trio to turn to a mysterious make who is willing to publish the game as long as he can take credit for it. In the exclusive clip below, the trio of game creators meets with this mysterious guy – who hands them a bear trap for some reason.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-641982\"></span></p>\n<h2><strong>Murder Bury Win Clip</strong></h2>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/C_yl7K47kxs?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>This is a <em>very</em> odd clip, but stick with it, because there&#8217;s a pay-off regarding a bear trap that I found fairly amusing. In <em>Murder Bury Win</em>, &#8220;Three friends have created a board game, <span class=\"il\">MURDER</span> <span class=\"il\">BURY</span> <span class=\"il\">WIN</span>, and they think it has what it takes to become a bestseller on the indie charts. When their attempt to crowdfund fails, a mysterious man makes them an offer: he will publish their game on the condition that he takes credit as the sole creator and owner.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Needless to say, things don&#8217;t go according to plan: &#8220;After a dispute over the gaming rights leaves them with a body on their hands, the young men realize how suspiciously like <span class=\"il\">murder</span> the freak accident appears. Now, with few options remaining, they look to their game for guidance. The premise of their game? How to <span class=\"il\">murder</span> someone and get rid of the body.&#8221; The <a href=\"http://murderburywin.com/about.html\">official site</a> for <em>Murder Bury Win</em> adds that it&#8217;s a &#8220;cautionary tale about the measures peoples are willing to take to win. And it also might be about how to kill someone and get rid of the body.&#8221; Check out the trailer below.</p>\n<h2><strong>Murder Bury Win Trailer</strong></h2>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/311819250?dnt=1&#38;app_id=122963\" width=\"740\" height=\"310\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" allowfullscreen title=\"Murder Bury Win - teaser trailer\"></iframe></p>\n<p>The flick comes from writer-director <strong>Michael Lovan</strong>, and features a cast that includes <strong>Mikelen Walker</strong>, <strong>Erich Lane</strong>, <strong>Henry Alexander Kelly</strong>, <strong>Craig Cackowski</strong>, and <strong>Brian Slaten</strong>.

Lucasfilm is still keeping plot details under wraps, but one line in this footage stood out among all the other dialogue we&#8217;ve heard so far, and it should have fans of Mandalorians very excited. Plus, there were some other interesting details to pick up on, so dig into our <em>The Mandalorian</em> special look breakdown to see what can be gleaned from the new footage.<span id=\"more-642059\"></span></p>\n<h2>The Mandalorian Special Look Breakdown</h2>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-642066 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-season2-speciallook-mando-shipcrash-700x291.jpg\" alt=\"The Mandalorian Season 2\" width=\"700\" height=\"291\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-season2-speciallook-mando-shipcrash-700x291.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-season2-speciallook-mando-shipcrash-360x150.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-season2-speciallook-mando-shipcrash-768x319.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-season2-speciallook-mando-shipcrash.jpg 1435w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>The special look at <em>The Mandalorian</em> season 2 opens up with X-wings in fast pursuit of Mando&#8217;s ship, the Razor Crest. It&#8217;s a shot we&#8217;ve seen before in the first trailer. But this time we hear one of the pilots telling the ship to stand down. Tthe ship is making its way through an ice canyon, strikes a cliffside, spins out of control, and starts crash landing backwards in the middle of a snowy landscape. The editing makes it appear like the X-wings are what causes this crash, but I think that&#8217;s a trick. I think this is the result of that first shot from the full trailer with the Razor Crest floating through space. This might be where the ship crash lands after being pulled into this planet&#8217;s atmosphere by gravity.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-642067 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-season2-speciallook-mando-friends-700x289.jpg\" alt=\"The Mandalorian Season 2\" width=\"700\" height=\"289\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-season2-speciallook-mando-friends-700x289.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-season2-speciallook-mando-friends-360x149.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-season2-speciallook-mando-friends-768x318.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-season2-speciallook-mando-friends.jpg 1434w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>We cut to The Mandalorian (<strong>Pedro Pascal</strong>) returning to Nevarro, where Greef Karga (<strong>Carl Weathers</strong>) and Cara Dune (<strong>Gina Carano</strong>) meet the bounty hunter and the Child. Dialogue has Mando saying, &#8220;I need your help. I&#8217;ve been quested to bring this one back to its kind.&#8221; I&#8217;m fairly certain that dialogue isn&#8217;t what is being said in this scene, but it&#8217;s more than likely that once they&#8217;re settled at a cantina or some place reasonably safe, Mando will ask them for assistance.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-642064 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-season2-speciallook-speeder-desert-700x289.jpg\" alt=\"The Mandalorian Season 2\" width=\"700\" height=\"289\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-season2-speciallook-speeder-desert-700x289.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-season2-speciallook-speeder-desert-360x149.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-season2-speciallook-speeder-desert-768x317.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-season2-speciallook-speeder-desert.jpg 1434w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a new angle on the speeder in the desert that we saw in the first trailer, the one that might have Mando carrying Boba Fett&#8217;s armor. This is a wider landscape shot though, so we can&#8217;t make anything out on that speeder. But there&#8217;s the skeleton of a Bantha sitting there in the sand, just a little detail that I don&#8217;t believe we&#8217;ve seen in live-action <em>Star Wars</em> before.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-642065 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-season2-speciallook-mando-snowing-700x291.jpg\" alt=\"The Mandalorian Season 2\" width=\"700\" height=\"291\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-season2-speciallook-mando-snowing-700x291.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-season2-speciallook-mando-snowing-360x149.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-season2-speciallook-mando-snowing-768x319.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-season2-speciallook-mando-snowing.jpg 1431w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Back on the snowy planet, it&#8217;s clear that Mando&#8217;s ship is in disrepair. But here, he takes a moment to look up at something in the cavern where his ship has crashed. Is there something lurking off-screen?</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-642068 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-season2-speciallook-fixingship-700x290.jpg\" alt=\"The Mandalorian Season 2\" width=\"700\" height=\"290\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-season2-speciallook-fixingship-700x290.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-season2-speciallook-fixingship-360x149.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-season2-speciallook-fixingship-768x319.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-season2-speciallook-fixingship.jpg 1429w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Speaking of something lurking, could Mando have inadvertently crashed his ship into some kind of ice creature? Look at that object in the foreground. At first, you might just think it&#8217;s part of Mando&#8217;s busted ship, but it actually looks like an insect limb. The same kind of appendage looks like it&#8217;s wrapped around the ship right behind Mando as he&#8217;s trying to make repairs. And if you look to the left of Mando, sitting on the wing of the Razor Crest next to the engine looks like what might be some kind of snow spider, clearly dead, but perhaps the smaller version of the creature those mysterious limbs belong to.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-642069 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-season2-speciallook-holdup-700x287.jpg\" alt=\"The Mandalorian Season 2\" width=\"700\" height=\"287\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-season2-speciallook-holdup-700x287.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-season2-speciallook-holdup-360x148.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-season2-speciallook-holdup-768x315.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-season2-speciallook-holdup.jpg 1435w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Going back to another sequence we&#8217;ve seen in the previous trailer, here&#8217;s the moment where Mando gets held up by some nefarious characters at a Gamorrean fight ring.

You can see the stone canyon passing by through the windows of the ship. And it looks like we might have a reason for their chase. There&#8217;s a third passenger in that ship, a blue-skinned Mythrol, the same species of alien that Mando was pursuing in the beginning of the first season premiere. Could it be the same one played by <strong>Horatio Sanz</strong>, or another character in the same species? It would be interesting if Mando ended up needing information from the same guy he already caught, but the last time we saw him, he was frozen in carbonite. So who knows?</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-642074 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-season2-speciallook-baby-concerned-700x292.jpg\" alt=\"The Mandalorian Season 2\" width=\"700\" height=\"292\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-season2-speciallook-baby-concerned-700x292.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-season2-speciallook-baby-concerned-360x150.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-season2-speciallook-baby-concerned-768x321.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-season2-speciallook-baby-concerned.jpg 1418w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Hey, we know you like to see new shots of Baby Yoda, so here&#8217;s a good one with the little creature looking somewhat concerned at whatever he&#8217;s looking at off-camera.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-642075 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-season2-speciallook-trio-dooropening-700x289.jpg\" alt=\"The Mandalorian Season 2\" width=\"700\" height=\"289\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-season2-speciallook-trio-dooropening-700x289.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-season2-speciallook-trio-dooropening-360x148.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-season2-speciallook-trio-dooropening-768x317.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-season2-speciallook-trio-dooropening.jpg 1433w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Back to the action, here&#8217;s Mando with Greef and Cara as a blast door opens in what looks like it could be an Imperial facility of some kind.

Perhaps they&#8217;re chasing after that cargo ship, because the canyon below them looks rather similar to the one the ship is speeding away in. Plus, you&#8217;ll notice that the TIE Fighters are flying away from a structure that&#8217;s on fire in the distance.

Well, it would appear that he&#8217;s taking to the skies in his jetpack instead. You&#8217;ll notice the river of lava in the rocks below him, so I think it&#8217;s safe to say that Mando is creating some kind of distraction, and maybe that&#8217;s why the TIE Fighters were deployed. We saw how Mando dealt with Moff Gideon in a TIE Fighter at the end of the first season. But how will he handle four of them?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">***</p>\n<p>Much of the action from this special look at <em>The Mandalorian</em> season 2 appears to come from just a few episodes. I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if there&#8217;s nothing here from any of the later episodes of the season, but that&#8217;s just speculation on my part. Either way, I can&#8217;t wait to see what this new chapter of <em>The Mandalorian</em> has in store. We&#8217;ll be keeping up with every new episode just as we did with the first season, so stay tuned.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\"

If you&#8217;re getting sick of watching horror movies and TV shows at home, maybe you&#8217;ll want to mix it up with some gaming, and one of the more entertaining options might be playing the latest iteration of <strong><em>Call of Duty</em></strong> during <strong><em>The Haunting of Verdansk</em></strong> Halloween gameplay event, because two horror icons are getting in on the action.</p>\n<p>Starting <strong>October 20</strong> and running through <strong>November 3</strong>, <em>Call of Duty</em> is kicking off an in-game Halloween event adding some new gameplay modes in both <em>Modern Warfare</em> and <em>Warzone</em> game variants, along with a spooky new nighttime setting and Halloween-themed rewards. But the most surprising and ridiculous thing about this whole <em>Call of Duty</em> Halloween event is that <strong><em>Texas Chainsaw Massacre</em></strong> killer Leatherface and the terrifying <strong><em>Saw</em></strong> mascot known as Billy the Puppet will be new player skins, bringing the horror icons and some of their killer style into the multiplayer action.<span id=\"more-642038\"></span></p>\n<h2>Billy the Puppet and Leatherface in Call of Duty</h2>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-642048 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/callofduty-halloween-billythepuppet-700x394.jpg\" alt=\"Call of Duty Halloween Event - Billy the Puppet\" width=\"700\" height=\"394\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/callofduty-halloween-billythepuppet-700x394.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/callofduty-halloween-billythepuppet-360x203.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/callofduty-halloween-billythepuppet-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/callofduty-halloween-billythepuppet.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><em>Do you want to play a game?</em></p>\n<p>First up, part of <em>The Haunting of Verdansk</em> event will be a new <em>Saw</em>-themed bundle that includes a Billy the Puppet skin for the operator Morte. Along with the creepy skin, players will also be able to use The Phlebotomozier Lethal Equipment piece, a special throwing knife that drills into enemies upon impact. There&#8217;s also special weapon blueprints, one for an assault rifle and one for a shotgun, as well as a tricycle charm to hang off your weapons other personalized items.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-642049 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/callofduty-halloween-leatherface-700x394.jpg\" alt=\"Call of Duty Halloween Event - Leatherface\" width=\"700\" height=\"394\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/callofduty-halloween-leatherface-700x394.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/callofduty-halloween-leatherface-360x203.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/callofduty-halloween-leatherface-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/callofduty-halloween-leatherface.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><em>Ain&#8217;t he got no pride in his home?</em></p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the <em>Texas Chainsaw Massacre</em> bundle will bring a Leatherface skin for the operator Velikan. Along with the skin, players will also receive a &#8220;Family Heirloom&#8221; blueprint for a light machine gun which allows players to wield their weapon like a chainsaw. The bundle also comes with the &#8220;Anybody Home?&#8221; melee blueprint that turns your secondary weapon into a one-handed hammer with a bone-breaker on one side and a meat tenderizer on the other. There are also a few other themed items in the bundle that you&#8217;ll have to check out when you get it.</p>\n<p>Look, I&#8217;m all for some Halloween-themed gaming events giving us something new to do for a couple weeks. But this is silly as hell. It makes a little more sense that these are player skins instead of being the actual characters themselves, but this is the first pop culture themed bundle that this latest iteration of <em>Call of Duty</em> has seen, and it just feels kind of dumb. Will I still play it?

Giacchino, who&#8217;s the Oscar-winning composer behind <em>Up</em> and <em>Star Trek</em>, is hopeful we&#8217;ll see the film one day. Unless we&#8217;re mistaken, the jovial composer is possibly alluding to a McCartney-<a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/paul-mccartneys-high-in-the-clouds-movie/\">Netflix project</a> called <em><strong>High in the Clouds</strong>.</em></p>\n<p><span id=\"more-642011\"></span></p>\n<p>We recently spoke to Giacchino about his debut <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Travelogue-1-Blue-Orange-Vinyl/dp/B08KMGJ79K/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&#38;keywords=Michael+giacchino&#38;qid=1603146582&#38;sr=8-1\">solo album</a>, <strong><em>Travelogue Volume 1</em></strong>, which is a pure delight that tells the story of an alien visiting Earth. During the interview, he told us about his love for The Beatles and a bit about the McCartney project. &#8220;There&#8217;s an animated film he was putting together and wanted to do, so he called and asked if I&#8217;d want to work with him on that,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s something we&#8217;ve been working on in the last bunch of years. One day, one day it&#8217;ll come to fruition.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Presumably, the animated movie he&#8217;s talking about is McCartney&#8217;s adaptation of his own children&#8217;s book, <em>High in the Clouds</em>, which he co-authored with <strong>Philip Ardagh</strong> and was illustrated by <strong>Geoff Dunbar</strong>. Last year, Netflix acquired the film about a teenage squirrel &#8220;pulled into a ramshackle gang of teenage rebels who live high in the clouds after he accidentally antagonizes Gretsch the owl, the tyrannical leader (and fabulous singer!), who steals the voice of anyone who upstages her.” McCartney wrote seven or eight new original songs for the movie.</p>\n<p>One of those unreleased songs involves <strong>Lady Gaga</strong>. Over five years ago, the pop star posted a <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/yqWGm_pFFR/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link\">behind-the-scenes</a> image of herself alongside a large band, including Giacchino, Pearl Jam guitarist <strong>Mike McCready</strong>, McCartney, and McCartney&#8217;s thunderous drummer, <strong>Abraham &#8220;Abe&#8221; Laboriel Jr. </strong>Rolling Stone Magazine confirmed Gaga contributed to one of the film&#8217;s songs.</p>\n<p>Netflix hasn&#8217;t shared a release date for <em>High in the Clouds </em>yet. The adaptation is directed by <strong>Timothy Reckart </strong>(the Oscar-winning <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96D-bRx5KuU\"><em>Head Over Heels</em></a>) and hails from the mind of <strong>Jon Croker</strong>, who wrote the live-action <em>Paddington </em>films. “We are thrilled to be partnering with Netflix,&#8221; McCartney said in the press release. &#8220;They complement what is already an amazing team with [the 125-year-old French studio] Gaumont and we can think of no-one better to be working with to bring our film to a global audience.  I’ve always loved animated films and this is a hugely important passion project for me. I can’t wait for the world to see it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Giacchino didn&#8217;t confirm whether <em>High in the Clouds </em>was the McCartney project to which he&#8217;s been contributing, but the Gaga picture may have pointed us in the right direction. In another life, Giacchino told us, McCartney would&#8217;ve been an amazing film composer. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been very lucky to work with him on a couple of things,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Getting to know him over the past seven years or so has been such a treat, because you realize this is a man who just does this because he loves it. It&#8217;s as simple as that. He loves the challenge that music gives him. He loves sharing the result of that challenge with everyone in the world. You listen to the breadth of work he&#8217;s done and you say to yourself, &#8216;Is there anyone else on the planet who can say they&#8217;ve done what Paul McCartney has done in the music world?&#8217; I&#8217;d say no.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/composer-michael-giacchino-is-working-with-paul-mccartney-on-an-animated-movie/\">Composer Michael Giacchino is Working With Paul McCartney on an Animated Movie</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=V8lNWLtZE-o:pJBMTeP0AFo:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=V8lNWLtZE-o:pJBMTeP0AFo:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=V8lNWLtZE-o:pJBMTeP0AFo:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=V8lNWLtZE-o:pJBMTeP0AFo:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=V8lNWLtZE-o:pJBMTeP0AFo:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=V8lNWLtZE-o:pJBMTeP0AFo:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/V8lNWLtZE-o\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 20 Oct 2020 14:30:06 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Michael-Giacchino-sf-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"03ebf942993ac4d8cdbbbd6fce04f12e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn14@2020_6/2020/10/20/16-11-31-399_eb5330a33036d38f.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":72710,"destBytes":40134,"author":"Jack Giroux","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Michael-Giacchino-sf-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn14@2020_6/2020/10/20/16-11-31-399_eb5330a33036d38f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn36@2020_4/2020/10/20/16-11-44-622_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=V8lNWLtZE-o:pJBMTeP0AFo:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn46@2020_1/2020/10/20/16-11-44-688_8b649fe635e76d52.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn96@2020_6/2020/10/20/16-11-45-536_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=V8lNWLtZE-o:pJBMTeP0AFo:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn32@2020_6/2020/10/20/16-11-44-822_bcc92ff03bcdff60.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/V8lNWLtZE-o":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn8@2020_3/2020/10/20/16-11-44-606_c9622a733ad854b9.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603210268113},{"createdTime":"2020-10-21 00:11:08","updatedTime":"2020-10-21 00:11:08","title":"The Quarantine Stream: ‘Friends’ is My Go-To Sitcom Comfort Show","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=642032","description":"<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-587860\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/friends-3-e1573649267762-700x315.jpg\" alt=\"Friends reunion\" width=\"700\" height=\"315\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/friends-3-e1573649267762-700x315.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/friends-3-e1573649267762-360x162.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/friends-3-e1573649267762-768x346.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><em>(Welcome to <a href=\"https://slashfilm.com/tag/the-quarantine-stream\"><strong>The Quarantine Stream</strong></a>, a new series where the /Film team shares what they’ve been watching while social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic.)</em></p>\n<p><strong>The Series:</strong> <em>Friends</em></p>\n<p><strong>Where You Can Stream It: </strong>HBO Max</p>\n<p><strong>The Pitch: </strong>Six attractive twenty-somethings struggle through life and love in New York City.</p>\n<p><strong>Why It’s Essential Quarantine Viewing: </strong>Like many millennials growing up in the &#8217;90s, I learned about sex through <em>Friends</em>. I didn&#8217;t quite understand all of their racy jokes or cheeky one-liners, but I thought it was so cool, so hip, so <em>grown-up</em>. <em>Friends</em> was like a fantasy of another place, populated by adults who had it together, or at least I thought so at the time. I know that it&#8217;s one of the most popular sitcoms of all time, and it has been &#8220;exposed&#8221; time and time again as being an outdated product of its time, but <em>Friends</em> still occupies a place in my heart as being that (still pretty funny!) fantasy of twenty-something life — the &#8220;fantasy&#8221; of which became even more clear when I found myself a twenty-something living in New York, around the same age as the cast of <em>Friends</em> was when the show first starts.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-642032\"></span></p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve watched the beloved NBC sitcom so many times that I could predict most of its comedic beats or recite a few of the line readings. It&#8217;s how my college roommate and I would become friends, while studying late in the night with <em>Friends</em> re-runs on the TV. Later when my college roommate became my roommate in New York, we would throw <em>Friends</em> on in the background as a sort of pleasant white noise, a show we&#8217;ve both seen too many times and were probably a little tired of.</p>\n<p>But I was still amazed how much <em>Friends</em> could surprise me (and I&#8217;m not talking about the dated gay panic jokes). Mostly because when we were watching the early seasons, it occurred to me that I was the same age as the cast of <em>Friends</em>, and that the show delved into their work and career struggles with far more authenticity than I would&#8217;ve thought. The bad bosses, the bad break-ups, the money troubles when eating out — it amazed me how <em>Friends</em> aged well, coming full circle not just with the fashion but with its concept of aimless young people in the city who create a found-family unit with each other. I&#8217;d argue that it&#8217;s aged even better than a later similar sitcom like <em>How I Met Your Mother</em> and its gross sexual politics in the wake of #MeToo, but that&#8217;s an essay for another day.</p>\n<p>In times of upheaval, I turn to <em>Friends</em> and its cozy, reliable, far-too clean vision of New York City in simpler times (albeit one that&#8217;s a little too white and with one too many homophobic jokes than I&#8217;d like). But the jokes still land and the chemistry between the cast is still phenomenal.
