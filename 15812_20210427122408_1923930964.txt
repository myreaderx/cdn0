In June of that year, the two hinted at their intentions to write a free graphical image manipulation program as a means of giving back to the free software&nbsp;community.</p> \n<p>On November 21st, 20 years ago today, Peter Mattis <a href=\"https://www.gimp.org/about/prehistory.html#november-1995-an-announcement\">announced the availability</a> of the “General Image Manipulation Program” on Usenet (later on, the acronym would be redefined to stand for the “<span class=\"caps\">GNU</span> Image Manipulation&nbsp;Program”).</p> \n<figure> \n <img src=\"https://www.gimp.org/news/2015/11/22/20-years-of-gimp-release-of-gimp-2816/{filename}./images/201512birthday_975.png\" alt=\"Wilber Birthday Strip\" /> \n</figure> \n<p>Since its public release the project has been evolving in many ways as a testbed for new ideas, which was considerably assisted by adding plug-in architecture. Over the years, <span class=\"caps\">GIMP</span> amassed a huge amount of new features designed for all kinds of users and practical applications: general image editing, retouching and color grading, digital painting, graphic design, science imaging&nbsp;etc.</p> \n<p>Between 2006 and 2012, the team collaborated with Peter Sikking of <em>man+machine works</em> to define <a href=\"https://gui.gimp.org/index.php/GIMP_UI_Redesign#product_vision\">product vision</a> and improve user experience. Thanks to this collaboration <span class=\"caps\">GIMP</span>’s user interface has become more conventional for professional users, and various tools have become more powerful and easy to use. But more importantly, we got a much better idea how to design good&nbsp;interfaces.</p> \n<p>In the past several years we’ve been working hard on porting <span class=\"caps\">GIMP</span> to a newer image processing engine called <span class=\"caps\">GEGL</span>. The switch to <span class=\"caps\">GEGL</span> made us rewrite or at least tweak pretty much every part of <span class=\"caps\">GIMP</span>’s source code. Fortunately, this work is nearing completion, and you’ll soon be able to benefit from all the changes that it’s&nbsp;bringing.</p> \n<h2 id=\"new-releases-and-the-future\">New Releases and The Future<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"https://www.gimp.org/news/2015/11/22/20-years-of-gimp-release-of-gimp-2816/#new-releases-and-the-future\" title=\"Permanent link\">¶</a></h2> \n<p>To celebrate the 20th anniversary, we released an update of the current stable version of <span class=\"caps\">GIMP</span>. Newly released <a href=\"https://www.gimp.org/downloads/\"><span class=\"caps\">GIMP</span> 2.8.16</a> features support for layer groups in OpenRaster files, fixes for layer groups support in <span class=\"caps\">PSD</span>, various user inrterface improvements, <span class=\"caps\">OSX</span> build system fixes, translation updates, and more&nbsp;changes.</p> \n<p>Our immediate future plans are to release first public version in the unstable 2.9.x series that will feature fully functional <span class=\"caps\">GEGL</span> port, 16/32bit per channel processing, basic OpenEXR support, vastly improved color management implementation, new tools, on-canvas preview for many filters, and more. This release will encompass over three years of work and become the first milestone towards&nbsp;2.10.</p> \n<p>Following v2.10 release, we shall complete the <span class=\"caps\">GTK</span>+3 port that is required to bring back state of the art Wacom support for Windows users. When it’s done and <span class=\"caps\">GIMP</span> 3.0 is out, we shall finally be able to get started on some very exciting and much anticipated features like non-destructive editing. Please refer to <a href=\"https://wiki.gimp.org/wiki/Roadmap\">Roadmap</a> for more&nbsp;details.</p> \n<h2 id=\"new-website\">New website<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"https://www.gimp.org/news/2015/11/22/20-years-of-gimp-release-of-gimp-2816/#new-website\" title=\"Permanent link\">¶</a></h2> \n<p>In conjunction with the 20th anniversary we have updated and revamped the website. The vast majority of the work on the new website was done by <a href=\"https://blog.patdavid.net/\">Pat David</a>.</p> \n<p>The update (<em>finally</em>) includes some much needed improvements such as <a href=\"https://www.gimp.org/news/\">news items</a> with permalinks and <a href=\"https://www.gimp.org/feeds/atom.xml\">full <span class=\"caps\">RSS</span>/Atom feeds</a>.
