Several conversations later, they agreed to have Sandberg join Facebook to focus on expanding advertising on the platform, which Zuckerberg had typically ignored in favor of expanding technological features, the book says.</p><p>&#34;She had thought, from his interest during their courtship dinners, that Zuckerberg was committed to strengthening the business and that he would be actively supportive of her role,&#34; the book says of Sandberg. &#34;As the weeks went by, though, it became apparent that she would have to fight to capture his attention.&#34; </p><p> The wedge between the company&#39;s leaders extended to their respective teams, separating tech and non-tech employees.</p><p>&#34;There was mutual distrust and annoyance,&#34; the book says. &#34;Engineers looked down on the &#39;marketing guys,&#39; and the business managers struggled to get into meetings with Zuckerberg&#39;s teams.&#34;</p><p>Tensions between the leaders led Sandberg to enlist Donald Graham, then a member of the company&#39;s board of directors, to &#34;lobby Zuckerberg for more resources on her behalf,&#34; according to the book.</p><p>&#34;His priority of growth was miles above advertising, revenue, and profits,&#34; Graham told the book&#39;s authors. &#34;It became my job to call him after every time Sheryl called and try to convince him about the importance of advertising, and not to change his priorities, but to help him move a little.&#34;</p><p>Facebook spokesperson Dani Lever denied any early tension between Zuckerberg and Sandberg. </p><p>&#34;This book tells a false narrative based on selective interviews, many from disgruntled individuals, and cherry-picked facts,&#34; Lever told Insider in a statement. &#34;The fault lines that the authors depict between Mark and Sheryl and the people who work with them do not exist. All of Mark&#39;s direct reports work closely with Sheryl and hers with Mark. Sheryl&#39;s role at the company has not changed.&#34; </p><p> </p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

technology stock valuations leave the broader market vulnerable, according to Morgan Stanley Wealth Management&#39;s chief investment officer.</p><p>In a Monday note, Lisa Shalett highlighted how low rates have helped prop up tech stocks to dot-com era valuations. The price to sales ratio of the technology sector is at a level not seen since the peak of the dot-com bubble in 2000, she said.</p><p>In addition, the tech sector now makes up a much larger weight in the <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/index/s&p_500_500\">S&#38;P 500</a> than in 2000, and has subsequently driven the price to sales ratio of the benchmark index to a level 50% higher than it has ever been. </p><p>&#34;The problem with this setup is that tech sector profitability and earnings are vulnerable,&#34; said Shalett. &#34;While secular growth trends may support resilience against small changes in economic growth, the sector now faces unprecedented headwinds from rising input costs, a weaker US dollar, fiercer competition, higher taxes, stricter regulations and customer backlash.&#34;</p><p>If those headwinds come to fruition for the technology sector, the broader market will be at risk. </p><p>She noted that markets tend to be strongest when they are broad based and there is a consensus narrative around what could go wrong in terms of economic outcomes, policy, geopolitics, and regulation. <br><br>&#34;As we have noted for the past two months, the market continues to grind to all-time highs on narrowing breadth, while the narrative has also grown increasingly muddled. Thus, the risks of a correction are rising,&#34; she said. </p><p>The chief investment officer of wealth management told clients to focus on stock-picking using earnings fundamentals. She also said investors could consider adding to financials stocks as a value-oriented hedge to rising rates. </p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60edbbafca74780018ae9189?format=jpeg\" alt=\"price to sales ratio chart\" height=\"223\" width=\"407\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Morgan Stanley</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><br><br></p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-market-outlook-sp500-correction-tech-bubble-lisa-shalett-2021-7'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=MrjJDAcVLmw:WxI3Dpu7SbI:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=MrjJDAcVLmw:WxI3Dpu7SbI:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=MrjJDAcVLmw:WxI3Dpu7SbI:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=MrjJDAcVLmw:WxI3Dpu7SbI:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=MrjJDAcVLmw:WxI3Dpu7SbI:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=MrjJDAcVLmw:WxI3Dpu7SbI:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=MrjJDAcVLmw:WxI3Dpu7SbI:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=MrjJDAcVLmw:WxI3Dpu7SbI:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/MrjJDAcVLmw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 13 Jul 2021 16:50:23 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/60edbb2561b8600019f16d03?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"7f5e603f55d22d5f96dcaa2382e0bcb1","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn84@2020_3/2021/07/13/17-22-26-233_4c04c28e2a80bb47.webp","destWidth":5546,"destHeight":4160,"sourceBytes":418972,"destBytes":418972,"author":"egraffeo@businessinsider.com (Emily Graffeo)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5f492ab9db1ed00029714836?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn75@2020_5/2021/07/13/17-22-25-430_25eb0cb43017242b.webp","https://i.insider.com/60edbbafca74780018ae9189?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn16@2020_2/2021/07/13/17-22-24-559_be7e11b6fdc141a2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn12@2020_2/2021/07/13/17-22-25-174_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=MrjJDAcVLmw:WxI3Dpu7SbI:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn63@2020_1/2021/07/13/17-22-23-637_00b3dcd0e649d92c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=MrjJDAcVLmw:WxI3Dpu7SbI:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn55@2020_4/2021/07/13/17-22-25-529_5b406060628a9082.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn83@2020_2/2021/07/13/17-22-23-761_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=MrjJDAcVLmw:WxI3Dpu7SbI:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn64@2020_5/2021/07/13/17-22-22-041_e2b043506e3a29d6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/MrjJDAcVLmw":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn59@2020_4/2021/07/13/17-22-21-602_38124cd432279abf.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1626196914831},{"createdTime":"2021-07-14 01:21:54","updatedTime":"2021-07-14 01:21:54","title":"The VC industry is reeling from the breakneck pace of dealmaking in 2021.

interested in healthcare since he was a child, but instead of going into medicine, he opted for telecommunications engineering - Reines says this was because he thought tech would be a better way to make a difference in improving people&#39;s access to healthcare. </p><p>He studied at the Polytechnic University of Madrid, Spain, and obtained a specialization in Biomedical Engineering at the Technical University of Delft in the Netherlands. </p><p>He started his career in digital health at Siemens Medical in Pennsylvania and prior to RubiconMD, he managed a division at Telefónica. </p><p>Reines told Insider he was named a Young Global Leader by the World Economic Forum and has an MBA from Harvard, which was the starting point for Rubicon.</p><p>Reines got involved in all the

got started in one weekend,&#34; said Reines. They both won a competition for best pitch, which encouraged them to pursue the idea and they ended up registering the company. </p><p>While all his fellow master&#39;s students were looking for a place in a big company that summer, Reines decided to bet everything on RubiconMD and turn it into his own project. </p><p>&#34;I went to New York and we set up the company that summer and made a small pilot,&#34; he explained. </p><p>Rubicon MD is a platform that connects primary care doctors with specialists so that they can consult with patients to avoid unnecessary referrals and make more accurate diagnoses. </p><p>The pilot, in which Reines had to work almost manually on a consultation-by-consultation basis, yielded information from more than 200 consultations. </p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60eda850ca74780018ae90f9?format=jpeg\" alt=\"healthcare\" height=\"1332\" width=\"1776\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Reines says the US healthcare system is very unequal: &#34;Half the country may not have access to a specialist.&#34;\n<p class=\"copyright\">Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>&#34;It allowed us to understand the system from the inside, what things needed to be optimized,&#34; explains Reines. </p><p>The feedback was decisive: the primary care doctor who took part in the pilot confirmed that in the last two months using the platform he had had more interaction with other doctors than in the last 10 years. </p><p>Rubicon improved the quality of care that primary care physicians can provide to patients who might not otherwise be able to access a specialist or would end up making an emergency room visit. </p><p>From there, the founders sought funding and Reines combined the second year of his master&#39;s degree - turning down an offer to help him with the project on the condition that he leave the master&#39;s.</p><p>What little savings the engineer did have had gone into his MBA. He even slept on his partner&#39;s sofa. </p><p>&#34;It was a tough time, but at the same time super nice because we took a leap of faith and it was all working out,&#34; he said. </p><p>In the first year, the startup raised $1.5 million, mostly through angel investors and some funds and medical groups.</p><h2><strong>Why the US system needed Rubicon </strong></h2><p>&#34;The healthcare system in the US is a very complex system,&#34; Reines said. &#34;It&#39;s the most expensive system in the world and they don&#39;t do any better than countries that spend half as much.&#34;  </p><p>&#34;The main problem is that it is a very unequal system,&#34; he says. &#34;Half the country may not have access to a specialist.&#34;</p><p>&#34;What we do in the US works very well because we connect primary care with the specialist so that they do a remote consultation. The specialist reviews your question and shares some impressions and recommendations about how they normally treat these types of cases and with that input the family doctor makes a more informed decision about diagnosis and treatment for their patients,&#34; he said.</p><p>Reines says that 80% of the time, this results in a very significant improvement in the patient&#39;s care plan and almost half of the time avoids what would have been an unnecessary referral to a specialist, &#34;thereby offloading the system and reducing unnecessary costs.&#34; </p><h2>The platform has already served 10 million patients</h2><p>Rubicon is now present in nearly 40 states across the country and has hired employees in each of them. </p><p>Thousands of doctors already use the platform and the number of patients under the care of these doctors has &#34;already exceeded 10 million,&#34; the entrepreneur said. </p><p>Who are RubiconMD&#39;s customers?  &#34;Well, mainly the most innovative medical groups,&#34; says Reines. </p><p>The country is experiencing a boom in companies that are transforming primary care, and Reines says that &#34;most of them are already customers&#34;. </p><p>&#34;We have found a niche in clinics that have an incentive to improve quality and reduce total cost, rather than a pay-for-service,&#34; he said. </p><p>RubiconMD also works with companies that have an in-office clinic, including &#34;some of the largest technology companies on the West Coast,&#34;as well as assembly-line factories and factories in rural areas. </p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60eda8aaca74780018ae90fd?format=jpeg\" alt=\"wind farm in Iowa\" height=\"3555\" width=\"4740\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Rubicon is extending better healthcare to more remote areas, too.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Jonathan Ernst/Reuters</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>On the other hand, RubiconMD is also used by a number of clinics known in the US as safety-net clinics, where people with the most basic insurance (which doesn&#39;t cover specialist costs or even papers) can be seen. </p><p>For Reines, this is the best illustration of the startup&#39;s philosophy and mission.</p><p>&#34;Maybe the patient in a practice is an executive in a technology company, who might have access to the specialist in another way. But, at the same time, you are also seeing the patient who has no insurance, or no papers, who works part-time and can&#39;t make time to go to the doctor. They would never be able to go to see the kind of top-notch specialist that we are bringing in&#34;. </p><p>&#34;Our mission as a company is to democratize access to healthcare,&#34; he said. </p><p>For now, however, Rubicon MD has its hands full with the USUnited States, although one of its short-term priorities is to continue hiring Spanish talent to expand the subsidiary in Spain. </p><p>&#34;In terms of service, what we have done is to go deeper into certain specialties and some types of conditions. For example, mental health,&#34; said Reines.</p><p>&#34;Primary care can help a lot to solve patients&#39; mental health problems, which are also closely linked to their physical health,&#34; he added. </p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60eda921ca74780018ae9114?format=jpeg\" alt=\"migrant children us-mexico border\" height=\"1342\" width=\"1789\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Rubicon works with a number of NGOs that send doctors to treat families on the ground, to avoid separating them at all costs.\n<p class=\"copyright\">John Moore/Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>&#34;We created a service that basically allows primary care doctors to manage patients with mental health issues much better, with remote support from a psychiatrist,&#34; said Reines. &#34;The platform has a database of each patient, which allows them to follow their progress and a question and answer session can be organized.&#34; </p><p>Reines said that they plan to do the same with chronic diseases.</p><p>As for going international, though RubiconMD is focused on the US market, the startup carries out impact and non-profit projects in areas where there&#39;s a greater need.<strong> </strong></p><p>&#34;For example, on the US-Mexico border there are refugee camps for people who have fled violence in their country and are waiting to cross into the United States,&#34; Reines said. When a child gets sick, they can be treated in the US, but it&#39;s naturally a difficult decision for the parents as they don&#39;t know when they&#39;ll see them again. </p><p>Rubicon works with a number of NGOs that send doctors to treat families on the ground, to avoid separating them at all costs.<strong> </strong></p><p>They do similar work at a children&#39;s malnutrition clinic in Haiti, another for underprivileged patients in the Dominican Republic, and a series of clinics in Nigeria.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

It&#39;s time policymakers take action to ensure one fair wage nationwide. </p><p>On May 25, I joined restaurant workers in downtown San Francisco as part of a nationwide wage strike to demand an end to the sub-minimum wage and a full, fair living wage nationwide. We engaged in civil disobedience to call attention to the ongoing injustice that tipped minimum wage workers are forced to endure every day, and were arrested by SFPD as a result. </p><p>As a wealthy white man, my experience being arrested was likely more comfortable than the conditions many of our nation&#39;s tipped workers face every day. <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/sexual-harassment-restaurant-industry-70-percent/\">70%</a> of women working as servers, bartenders, or other roles in the food services industry say they&#39;ve dealt with sexual harassment from their employers, coworkers or customers. COVID-19 has only exacerbated these issues and made working conditions worse for vulnerable employees. </p><p>Now, with our country facing an unprecedented hiring shortage, especially in the restaurant industry, it is slowing our economic recovery. Hard working Americans simply don&#39;t want to risk their lives for poverty wages any longer. It&#39;s important that allies in California, which is already a One Fair Wage state - a state that requires all employers to pay the full minimum wage with fair, non-discriminatory tips on top - with a stronger restaurant industry to prove it, join this fight.</p><p>I am a successful business leader, a former executive, and now an investor in old and new businesses across the United States, so I know what a good investment looks like.  I&#39;ve done the research and seen for myself how ending the sub-minimum wage and enacting a full, fair minimum wage with tips on top is not only good for restaurant workers, but for owners and customers as well.  Pre-pandemic, the seven existing One Fair Wage states have<a href=\"https://onefairwage.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/OFW_FederalFactSheet_3-1.pdf\"> higher</a> restaurant industry growth and even higher rates of tipping. Even now, though all restaurants have struggled mightily in the face of COVID-19 shutdowns, restaurants in One Fair Wage states have on average seen<a href=\"https://onefairwage.site/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/OFW_DeclineHospBus_3.pdf\"> less decline</a> in their number of open businesses in the hospitality industry. </p><p>But don&#39;t take it from me. Take it from the heads of the corporate restaurant chains that have long been fighting against raising wages.<a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/mcdonalds-other-ceos-tell-investors-15-minimum-wage-wont-hurt-business-1580978\"> On call after call</a>, these CEOs have not only said that a higher minimum wage for all workers doesn&#39;t hurt their business, they&#39;ve also admitted that it&#39;s actually <em>better</em> for business. </p><p>The CFO of Denny&#39;s, for instance, said on an investor call that California raising its minimum wage has helped the chain outperform there versus the rest of the country. Understandably, that&#39;s led to a<a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/dennys-shareholders-revolt-after-ceo-concedes-15-minimum-wage-wont-hurt-business-1588970\"> shareholder revolt</a> against the company&#39;s continued lobbying against a $15 minimum wage. If companies like Denny&#39;s admit that One Fair Wage is good for their bottom line, they&#39;re violating their fiduciary duty by spending millions of dollars lobbying against fair wage laws.</p><p>That&#39;s why our protest in San Francisco started outside Denny&#39;s downtown. We need to hold them accountable for their hypocrisy and the low-wages they&#39;re still paying our brothers and sisters across the country. </p><p>The bottom line is that the federal government has already bailed out restaurant owners to the tune of over $28 billion over the last year and a half. It&#39;s time for the federal government to give restaurant workers the same attention, and mandate that they must be paid what they deserve.</p><p>The House has acted. Now, we need the Senate to pass the full Raise the Wage Act, which would end subminimum wages for tipped workers and make a $15 minimum wage the law of the land.  </p><p>As a business executive and investor, I know that what&#39;s good for people is good for business. We&#39;re a consumer-driven economy, and putting more money in the hands of workers is essential to driving demand. On the flip side, smart business leaders know that inequality is bad for the economy and bad for business. With the pandemic driving more profits and government bailouts into the hands of the ownership class while impoverishing and bankrupting workers, we&#39;re all going to end up worse off unless a drastic change is made. </p><p>Restaurants don&#39;t have a worker shortage, they have a wage shortage. That&#39;s why I stood in solidarity with restaurant workers and was arrested alongside them in their nationwide wage strike. It&#39;s time we demand better for everyone. Call your representatives and let our leaders know that we demand a just and thriving economy, and therefore we demand giving all workers a living wage.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/business-economy-worker-shortage-restaurants-rights-wages-protest-2021-7'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=RYOcbcmXxJY:oA_tVJH56n4:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=RYOcbcmXxJY:oA_tVJH56n4:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=RYOcbcmXxJY:oA_tVJH56n4:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=RYOcbcmXxJY:oA_tVJH56n4:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=RYOcbcmXxJY:oA_tVJH56n4:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=RYOcbcmXxJY:oA_tVJH56n4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=RYOcbcmXxJY:oA_tVJH56n4:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=RYOcbcmXxJY:oA_tVJH56n4:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/RYOcbcmXxJY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 13 Jul 2021 13:02:00 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/60e74ec06164f3001853b53c?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"7bf640226cdfa6dc7779b4bf780f3ea5","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn19@2020_4/2021/07/13/17-22-26-313_7e25e576cbcf14f1.webp","destWidth":2664,"destHeight":1998,"sourceBytes":192790,"destBytes":192790,"author":"insider@insider.com (Brian Boland)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/60e74ec9c03e9c0018ab2916?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn91@2020_6/2021/07/13/17-22-22-219_4acfa052c27af769.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn12@2020_2/2021/07/13/17-22-25-174_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=RYOcbcmXxJY:oA_tVJH56n4:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn3@2020_4/2021/07/13/17-22-23-346_f86ff7e897c28270.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=RYOcbcmXxJY:oA_tVJH56n4:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn64@2020_3/2021/07/13/17-22-26-038_69d8a97c2dc11145.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn83@2020_2/2021/07/13/17-22-23-761_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=RYOcbcmXxJY:oA_tVJH56n4:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn43@2020_1/2021/07/13/17-22-23-133_943622bd2d5c7930.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/RYOcbcmXxJY":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn87@2020_4/2021/07/13/17-22-23-276_b228c3631a2be054.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1626196914890},{"createdTime":"2021-07-14 01:21:54","updatedTime":"2021-07-14 01:21:54","title":"TikTok bans sponsored posts relating to cryptocurrency, investment services, and trading platforms","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/tiktok-crypto-bitcoin-investing-trading-ban-sponsored-ad-content-branded-2021-7","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60ed93d361b8600019f16c46?format=jpeg\" alt=\"TikTok stocks\" height=\"2499\" width=\"5000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>In this photo illustration, a TikTok logo is displayed on a smartphone with stock market percentages in the background.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Photo Illustration by Omar Marques/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>TikTok has banned creators from publishing sponsored content related to cryptocurrencies and investing services. </li>\n<li>The social media app&#39;s branded content policy also bans the promotion of weapons, alcohol, and gambling.</li>\n<li>TikTok said the policy is &#34;designed to ensure a safe and positive environment&#34;

It went about as smoothly as you&#39;d expect a five-hour testimony from an outspoken billionaire with practically no filter would go. </p><p>That is to say, things got off-topic and, at some points, pretty testy. </p><p>A group of Tesla shareholders is suing Musk over the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-tesla-solarcity-merger-frenzied-plan-new-filings-show-2019-10\">purchase of SolarCity</a>, alleging that his role as its chairman and largest shareholder presented a conflict of interest. They claim that Musk pressured Tesla&#39;s board into greenlighting the $2.6 billion purchase and want Musk to pay back $2 billion to the electric-vehicle maker.</p><p>Other members of the board have already settled to the tune of $60 million.</p><p>Musk maintains that he did not exert any influence over the board as it made the decision and pushed back against claims that it was a bailout, multiple <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/musk-testify-defense-teslas-26-bln-deal-solarcity-2021-07-12/\">outlets</a> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/07/12/elon-musk-trial-tesla/\">reported</a>. He also reiterated that the deal was a stock-for-stock transaction that didn&#39;t benefit him financially and that it was always part of Tesla&#39;s plan to move beyond electric-vehicle production into clean-energy solutions. </p><p>Still, much of the day saw Musk sparring with the shareholders&#39; main attorney, Randy Baron, and giving meandering answers that got off-topic. Here are five of the most notable moments:</p><h2>Musk &#34;hates&#34; running Tesla</h2><p>Musk at one point said he doesn&#39;t want to be Tesla&#39;s CEO but fears that the company would falter without him. </p><p>&#34;I tried very hard not to be the CEO of Tesla, but I have to or frankly Tesla is going to die,&#34; Musk said, according to <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-12/elon-musk-tells-court-tesla-s-solarcity-deal-wasn-t-a-bailout?sref=LspfQlRv\">Bloomberg</a>. &#34;I rather hate being a boss. I&#39;m an engineer.&#34; </p><p>Musk, who also serves as CEO of SpaceX, a rocket firm he founded, has <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-says-he-is-impulsive-does-not-like-ceo-template-tesla-2018-12\">said</a> similar things before. Tesla itself acknowledges in regulatory filings that it relies heavily on Musk and that it would be in a tough spot if he left the company. </p><h2>&#34;I think you are a bad human being.&#34;</h2><p>Sparks flew between Musk and Baron, the plaintiffs&#39; lawyer, in pre-trial depositions. Monday was no exception.</p><p>Asked why he was being &#34;derisive&#34; in his deposition, Musk retorted by pointing out a history of criminal activity at a law firm Baron used to work at. </p><p>&#34;You were mentored by criminals,&#34; Musk said, according to <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-12/elon-musk-tells-court-tesla-s-solarcity-deal-wasn-t-a-bailout?sref=LspfQlRv\">Bloomberg</a>. &#34;Then you continued to be mentored by criminals and that is why I do not respect you. I think you are a bad human being.&#34;</p><p><em><strong>Read more:</strong> </em><em><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-solar-panels-roof-energy-leaks-arbitration-elon-musk-2021-6\">A couple says their Tesla Solar panels caused relentless leaks that led to mold 10 times the healthy limit, $115,000 in damages, and a long-running legal battle</a></em></p><h2>&#34;I think I&#39;m funny.&#34;</h2><p>Baron asked if Tesla&#39;s board approved Musk&#39;s title change to Technoking in March, and Musk responded that it was a joke that was <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-tesla-technoking-jokes-funny-free-press-court-solarcity-2021-7\">aimed at getting the carmaker free press</a>. The company <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-proved-tesla-doesnt-need-advertising-2020-5\">has no advertising budget</a>, and Musk is known for leaning into <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-tesla-model-s-price-cut-lucid-unveils-air-2020-10\">memes</a> and internet culture.  </p><p>&#34;It generated a whole bunch of free press and Tesla doesn&#39;t advertise and it&#39;s helpful to general sales,&#34; he said, per <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/musk-testify-defense-teslas-26-bln-deal-solarcity-2021-07-12/\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"60\" data-uri=\"e8cab0a492e155d8bfaf50bb9ecb666c\">Reuters</a>. </p><p>&#34;I think I&#39;m funny,&#34; Musk added. </p><h2>Musk denied &#34;rage-firing&#34; anyone.</h2><p>Pushing back against claims that he ousts employees in fits of rage, Musk said that he only gives &#34;clear and frank feedback which may be construed as derision,&#34; according to <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-12/elon-musk-tells-court-tesla-s-solarcity-deal-wasn-t-a-bailout?sref=LspfQlRv\">Bloomberg</a>. </p><p>Tesla is notorious for its high executive turnover, and there have been <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-reportedly-terrified-tesla-staff-with-his-firing-sprees-2018-12\">reports</a> that Musk goes on wild firing rampages. Tesla has refuted those claims. </p><h2>&#34;I was offered several high-paid jobs on Wall Street.&#34;</h2><p>In another timeline, Musk <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-career-wall-street-turned-down-high-paid-jobs-2021-7\">could have worked in finance</a>, he told the court on Monday. </p><p>&#34;I was offered several high-paid jobs on Wall Street,&#34; Musk said, per Bloomberg. &#34;I declined.&#34; </p><p>Musk didn&#39;t say where he could have worked. But, with a net worth close to $200 billion, he has made out well for himself anyway. </p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

But it would nonetheless represent a solid gain at a time when some investors are questioning whether US stocks can continue their stellar rally.</p><p>FactSet, a data company which aggregates industry forecasts, said analysts expect the energy and materials sectors to see the biggest increase in stock prices.

from the Financial Times.</p><p>Two high-powered legal teams are jostling to bring a collective action against the banks in London courts, pursuing a US-style class-action strategy that could lead to huge payouts. Under a 2015 UK law, class-action suits can be pursued if there are suspected violations of competition law in play, according to the FT.</p><p>The banks, which include UBS, Barclays, Citibank, and JPMorgan, are accused of colluding to rig prices in the $6 trillion foreign-exchange market between 2007 and 2013. Traders allegedly coordinated currency bets in online chat rooms, exchanging information on customer orders and prices. </p><p>In 2019, the banks coughed up over €1 billion in fines to the European Commission, following on similar fines paid to US, UK, and Swiss regulators. In sum, banks have paid north of $12 billion in fines over the FX-rigging scandal, according to the FT.</p><p>UBS initially escaped the 2019 European fines by disclosing its misconduct early, but the regulatory action was effectively an &#34;open invitation for parties who may have been impacted by these cartels to sue these banks,&#34; as one lawyer <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48292946\">told the BBC</a> at the time.</p><p>That prediction now seems prescient as the two competing class-action cases are being bankrolled by litigation financiers who buy equity in the outcome of a case.</p><p>Separately, HSBC is facing allegations from a former client of FX fraud in front of London&#39;s High Court.

You&#39;ve accused your adversaries of treason. Who specifically are you accusing of treason?&#34; NBC&#39;s Peter Alexander asked Trump at a White House event.</p><p>&#34;Well, I think a number of people&#34; in the bureau &#34;have unsuccessfully tried to take down the wrong person,&#34; Trump replied, pointing to former FBI Director James Comey; former Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe; Peter Strzok, a former FBI agent; and Lisa Page, a former FBI lawyer.</p><p>In September of that year, Trump said Rep. Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-calls-rep-adam-schiff-arrested-for-treason-2019-9\">should be arrested for treason</a>.

Adam Schiff illegally made up a FAKE &#38; terrible statement, pretended it to be mine as the most important part of my call to the Ukrainian President, and read it aloud to Congress and the American people,&#34; Trump tweeted on September 30. &#34;It bore NO relationship to what I said on the call.

For example, they often come from an outbreak, a breakthrough infection from <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/fully-vaccinated-people-got-covid-after-an-outdoor-wedding-2021-7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">someone who&#39;s vaccinated,</a> a patient with unusually severe disease, or those with a travel history.</p><p><strong><em>Read more:</em></strong> <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/vaccine-mrna-covid-drug-treatment-future-of-medicine-2021-5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Experts explain why the mRNA tech that revolutionized COVID-19 vaccines could be the answer to incurable diseases, heart attacks, and even snake bites: &#39;The possibilities are endless&#39;</em></a></p><p>This could lead to overestimates of the number of infections caused by variants such as Delta, Outbreak.info said.</p><p>The CDC said in January that it had partnered with commercial labs and academic institutions to try to sequence <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/cdc-role-surveillance.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">up to 20,000 samples a week,</a> which would have amounted to 18.4% of the US&#39;s weekly cases on Tuesday. The GISAID data suggests it is far short of this goal.</p><p>The same GISAID data showed that it took the US an average of 22 days to upload sequencing data onto its database, which could mean estimates for the number of Delta infections are outdated. The UK took an average of 11 days.</p><p>The US was not lagging behind every rich nation: it&#39;s 4.12% rate of positive tests sequenced and shared was higher than Israel&#39;s, at 1.26%.</p><p>A modeling study <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.12.21249613v1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">posted in January </a>estimated that a country needed to sequence 5% of positive tests to detect an emerging strain, assuming 0.1% to 1% of the population were infected with it.  </p><p>The CDC <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f8e83ce5-037f-469d-bee9-aaa37f6e2554\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">told the Financial Times</a> that it was &#34;confident&#34; that with the current surveillance strategy &#34;new and emerging variants would be detected well before they become prominent.&#34; </p><h2>Patchwork approach to sequencing</h2><p>Will Lee, vice-president of science at the genomics company Helix, which has a sequencing contract with the CDC, said that piecing data together was a challenge. &#34;With so many different places and means of getting tested, it can be hard to get the sequences,&#34;

toughened their scrutiny of cryptocurrency trading in general, while US investors were net buyers of crypto assets, according to <a href=\"https://coinshares.com/research/digital-asset-fund-flows\">CoinShares</a> data. </p><p>The crypto trading volumes totalled $1.58 billion for the week, as activity quietened mostly for bitcoin. Bitcoin saw net outflows of $6.9 million, a steep decline from net inflows of $38.9 million the week before. </p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60e4474093b49f0018ee088a?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Weekly crypto asset flows\" height=\"542\" width=\"785\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Weekly crypto asset flows\n<p class=\"copyright\">CoinShares</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>&#34;In recent weeks, there has been a regional divide in bitcoin inflows, with North American providers seeing consistent inflows while their European counterparts have continued to see outflows, suggesting a geographic divergence in sentiment,&#34; the report said. </p><p>So far this month, bitcoin has traded in a relatively narrow band, between lows of around $32,100 and a high of around $34,500 - a far cry from the extreme volatility of May, when it swung from a low of $30,000 to a high of nearly $59,600, according to Coinbase. </p><p>Since hitting a record of nearly $65,000 in April the coin has tumbled by nearly 50%, although it is still up almost 260% in the last year.</p><p>Regulation was another factor. The UK regulator <a href=\"https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-bans-sale-crypto-derivatives-retail-consumers\">banned </a>retail consumers from buying crypto derivatives last year. Since then, it <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/news/binance-uk-ban-mean-local-investors-regular-trading-cryptocurrencies-fca-2021-6\">ordered</a> Binance, a crypto exchange, to halt regulated activities in the country. </p><p>&#34;Europe is a little bit behind in terms of investment into crypto assets,&#34; James Butterfill, CoinShares chief investment strategist, told Insider. </p><p>CoinShares is Europe&#39;s largest crypto asset manager. The company had $3.35 billion under management by the end of the first quarter, according to its recent earnings report.</p><p>Other crypto assets witnessed net inflows. Ether saw inflows of $800,000, Binance coin saw inflows of $400,000  and cardano&#39;s ada token saw $600,000 in flows. </p><p>Multi-asset investment products, like Bitwise 10 crypto index fund, which tracks the performance of the top 10 crypto coins for example, were the most popular last week, with inflows of $1.2 million. CoinShares said this suggested investors were diversifying their holdings.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/crypto-trading-volumes-hit-9-month-low-as-europeans-ditch-bitcoin-2021-7'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=-v8UJ5Cijks:KYFQRkuIKH8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=-v8UJ5Cijks:KYFQRkuIKH8:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=-v8UJ5Cijks:KYFQRkuIKH8:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=-v8UJ5Cijks:KYFQRkuIKH8:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=-v8UJ5Cijks:KYFQRkuIKH8:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=-v8UJ5Cijks:KYFQRkuIKH8:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=-v8UJ5Cijks:KYFQRkuIKH8:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=-v8UJ5Cijks:KYFQRkuIKH8:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/-v8UJ5Cijks\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 13 Jul 2021 14:15:30 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/60ed9754ca74780018ae90bd?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"450f96de071c7866e1a8fc49a0ee1c70","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn20@2020_1/2021/07/13/17-22-21-605_64b2f41207c2d0e0.webp","destWidth":5876,"destHeight":4407,"sourceBytes":459946,"destBytes":459946,"author":"cshumba@insider.com (Camomile Shumba )","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/60ed974561b8600019f16c51?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn19@2020_6/2021/07/13/17-22-24-789_43ac699f2a7aa38c.webp","https://i.insider.com/60e4474093b49f0018ee088a?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn27@2020_1/2021/07/13/17-22-24-445_adfdca8ea71ee75e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn12@2020_2/2021/07/13/17-22-25-174_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=-v8UJ5Cijks:KYFQRkuIKH8:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn24@2020_5/2021/07/13/17-22-23-013_3577dbf1875353ec.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=-v8UJ5Cijks:KYFQRkuIKH8:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn15@2020_2/2021/07/13/17-22-22-632_0f511d64569c21d6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn83@2020_2/2021/07/13/17-22-23-761_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=-v8UJ5Cijks:KYFQRkuIKH8:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn91@2020_5/2021/07/13/17-22-24-742_aade0a61b6139caa.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/-v8UJ5Cijks":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn92@2020_3/2021/07/13/17-22-23-037_13fd938b0adffef3.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1626196914881},{"createdTime":"2021-07-14 01:21:54","updatedTime":"2021-07-14 01:21:54","title":"The Delta variant is hitting red states hardest as the US's vaccine divide widens","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/delta-coronavirus-variant-hitting-republican-states-vaccine-divide-2021-7","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60ecab12ca74780018ae8f81?format=jpeg\" alt=\"anti vaccine trump rally\" height=\"2333\" width=\"3500\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>A protester holds an anti-vaccine sign as supporters of President Donald Trump rally in Woodland Hills, California, on May 16, 2020.\n<p class=\"copyright\">David McNew/Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>The Delta variant is sickening people most in unvaccinated, heavily Republican &#34;red&#34; states.</li>\n<li>Arkansas, Mississippi, Missouri, and Wyoming have seen upticks in cases and hospitalizations.</li>\n<li>But the variant has had little effect in blue states like Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont.</li>\n<li id=\"recirc\"><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">See more stories on Insider&#39;s business page</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>The US&#39;s daily coronavirus cases have soared 60% in the last two weeks as the Delta variant strengthens its hold on the country.

Delta cases have risen primarily in states with low vaccination rates, which for the most part are heavily Republican - &#34;red&#34; states like Arkansas, Mississippi, Missouri, and Wyoming. Overall, these states have seen higher upticks in daily cases and hospitalizations than &#34;blue&#34; states that voted Democratic in the 2020 election.</p><p>In Missouri, for instance, daily cases have risen around 75% in the last two weeks, from around 800 to 1,400 cases per day. Hospitalizations have also risen 34% during that time, from around 830 to 1,100 per day.

Delta made up less than 1% of coronavirus cases there in the last two months.</p><p>Other blue states, like Maine, New Hampshire, and Pennsylvania, have also reported some of the lowest case numbers and highest vaccination rates in the country.

For one, Republicans are more likely to believe that vaccines aren&#39;t safe or that the shots aren&#39;t necessary to protect their health, according to <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/poll-finding/kff-covid-19-vaccine-monitor-june-2021/\">a June survey</a> from the Kaiser Family Foundation.</p><p>Additionally, Republican states also tend to be more rural, so access to shots may still prevent some people in those areas from getting immunized.</p><p>In Arkansas, for instance, around 42% of counties are rural. Research from Boston Children&#39;s Hospital suggests that <a href=\"https://vaccineplanner.org/\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"80\" data-uri=\"a9a1f7d463a4a9339b3daca9473eabc1\">several Arkansas counties</a> qualify as &#34;vaccine deserts,&#34; with the nearest COVID-19 vaccination site more than a 15-minute drive away. Just 43% of Arkansas residents have received at least one vaccine dose.</p><p>But the state&#39;s health director, Dr. José Romero, blames the low vaccination rate on widespread vaccine hesitancy - not lack of access. The Kaiser Family Foundation <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/poll-finding/kff-covid-19-vaccine-monitor-june-2021/\">survey</a> found that rural residents are also significantly more vaccine hesitant than urban or suburban residents.</p><p>&#34;We&#39;ve done everything we can,&#34; Romero <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/arkansas-delta-variant-epicenter-vaccine-uptake-low-2021-7\">told Insider</a>. &#34;We&#39;ve made the vaccine available.

He gave the advice for Pennsylvania and Michigan, it says, which ultimately were called for Joe Biden.</p><p>Lennig and Rucker wrote that Giuliani had his own &#34;war room&#34; set up in the White House&#39;s Red Room, separate to the two others Trump had arranged.</p><p>As results came in, he began to &#34;cause a commotion,&#34; trying to get into the private quarters where Trump was, they said. </p><p>It recounts campaign manager Bill Stepien, White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and senior campaign manager Jason Miller taking Giuliani aside as others speculated that he had been drinking too much.</p><p>Giuliani, the book says, went through the projections state by state, asking the three what was happening. &#34;What&#39;s happening in Michigan?&#34; he is reported to have asked.</p><p data-el=\"text\">When Stepien, Meadows and Miller told him each time that it was too early to say, Giuliani is quoted as saying: &#34;Just say we won.&#34;</p><p data-el=\"text\">He gave the same advice for Pennsylvania, the book said, and kept going &#34;state after state,&#34; though the excerpt did not specify which.</p><p data-el=\"text\">Early results gave Trump a lead in Pennsylvania, which evaporated over time as later returns favored Biden. Many networks, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/joe-biden-wins-general-election-against-donald-trump-2020-11\">including Insider, called the entire election for Biden</a> once they were confident that Trump had no way of regaining his lead in that Pennsylvania.</p><p data-el=\"text\">Giuliani&#39;s predictions of victory were &#34;based on nothing,&#34; the book said. </p><p data-el=\"text\">According to the excerpt, Meadows said: &#34;We can&#39;t do that.&#34;</p><p data-el=\"text\">In the end, Trump did not need convincing of the falsehood anyway. He had long trailed the false idea that <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-was-convinced-election-night-would-repeat-of-2016-report-2020-11\">his victory was inevitable</a> unless election fraud was involved - a notion that <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-mail-in-voting-end-for-republicans-2020-5\">he had spent months sowing</a>.</p><p data-el=\"text\">He brought it up again on election night, after Fox News called Arizona for Biden. An apoplectic Trump <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-falsely-claims-he-won-presidential-election-2020-10\">announced that the election was being stolen from him</a>, famously saying: &#34;Frankly, we did win this election.&#34;</p><p data-el=\"text\">Giuliani did not immediately respond to Insider&#39;s request for comment. </p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/just-say-we-won-giuliani-election-lie-trump-new-book-2021-7'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=qkH-4-hbPK0:X-oziQ4JPBk:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=qkH-4-hbPK0:X-oziQ4JPBk:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=qkH-4-hbPK0:X-oziQ4JPBk:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=qkH-4-hbPK0:X-oziQ4JPBk:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=qkH-4-hbPK0:X-oziQ4JPBk:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=qkH-4-hbPK0:X-oziQ4JPBk:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=qkH-4-hbPK0:X-oziQ4JPBk:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=qkH-4-hbPK0:X-oziQ4JPBk:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/qkH-4-hbPK0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 13 Jul 2021 13:53:30 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/60ed909aca74780018ae90a3?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"b4aa37bef383f7fae9eb6a5677619087","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn85@2020_4/2021/07/13/17-22-22-693_9d5a0364873ebe86.webp","destWidth":3415,"destHeight":2561,"sourceBytes":190504,"destBytes":190504,"author":"mjankowicz@businessinsider.com (Mia Jankowicz)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/609265da34af8d001859b262?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn75@2020_3/2021/07/13/17-22-22-899_59509b45cc05b673.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn12@2020_2/2021/07/13/17-22-25-174_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=qkH-4-hbPK0:X-oziQ4JPBk:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn23@2020_2/2021/07/13/17-22-26-046_c516f91e8c34309e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=qkH-4-hbPK0:X-oziQ4JPBk:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn51@2020_3/2021/07/13/17-22-23-006_b0d7e0b597cef4b8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn83@2020_2/2021/07/13/17-22-23-761_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=qkH-4-hbPK0:X-oziQ4JPBk:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn12@2020_1/2021/07/13/17-22-24-761_5268dd9e07c3ce53.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/qkH-4-hbPK0":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn15@2020_5/2021/07/13/17-22-21-597_40d931febd1fcf89.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1626196914896},{"createdTime":"2021-07-14 01:21:54","updatedTime":"2021-07-14 01:21:54","title":"Viral video of Taliban executing 22 Afghan commandos as they surrendered ignites more criticism of Biden's withdrawal","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/video-shows-taliban-executing-22-afghan-commandos-cnn-2021-7","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60edafd5ca74780018ae9137?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Afghan special force commando unit officers and soldiers attend a graduation ceremony at the military academy in Kabul, Afghanistan, on May 31, 2021.\" height=\"1000\" width=\"2000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Afghan special force commando unit officers and soldiers attend a graduation ceremony at the military academy in Kabul, Afghanistan, on May 31, 2021.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Haroon Sabawoon/Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>22 Afghan commandos were apparently massacred by the Taliban while surrendering in June.</li>\n<li>CNN obtained video of the brutal incident, which raises more concerns about Afghanistan&#39;s future. </li>\n<li>&#34;This is horrible-yet it&#39;s the reality of announcing the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan,&#34; Rep.

But the US pullout does not mean an end to violent conflict in Afghanistan, which has seen consistent fighting for roughly four decades. The Taliban last week said it&#39;s taken over <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/militia-commanders-rush-aid-afghan-forces-against-taliban-2021-07-09/\">85% of the country</a>, and with regional militias popping up across Afghanistan there are worries that the war will escalate after the US departure.  </p><p>&#34;Civil war is certainly a path that can be visualized if it continues on the trajectory it&#39;s on,&#34; Gen. Austin S. Miller, who <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/top-us-general-afghanistan-austin-s-miller-is-stepping-down-2021-7\">stepped down</a> as the top US commander in Afghanistan on Monday, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/29/world/asia/afghanistan-civil-war-miller.html\">said earlier this month</a>. </p><p>Biden announced the plan to withdraw troops in April, and has <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/07/08/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-drawdown-of-u-s-forces-in-afghanistan/\">fervently defended the move</a> amid escalating concerns about the future of Afghanistan with the US departure nearly complete. Proponents of Biden&#39;s withdrawal contend that the pullout was long overdue, making the case that the costs of staying in Afghanistan far outweigh the benefits.</p><p>&#34;Let me ask those who wanted us to stay: How many more - how many thousands more of America&#39;s daughters and sons are you willing to risk? How long would you have them stay?&#34; Biden said in a speech last Thursday.</p><p>But critics have characterized the withdrawal as a hasty retreat that endangers local populations - <a href=\"https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2021/04/biden-must-protect-womens-rights-after-afghanistan-withdrawal/173657/\">especially women</a> - and effectively hands the country over to the Taliban.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet blockquote\" data-lang=\"en\" data-cards=\"\" data-conversation=\"\">-Jennifer Jacobs  (@JenniferJJacobs) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mims/statuses/1414958542172434446?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 13, 2021</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script><p> </p><p>Biden has rejected the notion that it&#39;s &#34;inevitable&#34; the Taliban will fully regain control of Afghanistan. &#34;I trust the capacity of the Afghan military, who is better trained, better equipped and more competent in terms of conducting war,&#34; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CBSNews/status/1413202883156271110?s=20\">the president said</a> on Thursday. </p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/video-shows-taliban-executing-22-afghan-commandos-cnn-2021-7'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=8y_DX3B6Ays:NfOMySLWemg:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=8y_DX3B6Ays:NfOMySLWemg:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=8y_DX3B6Ays:NfOMySLWemg:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=8y_DX3B6Ays:NfOMySLWemg:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=8y_DX3B6Ays:NfOMySLWemg:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=8y_DX3B6Ays:NfOMySLWemg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=8y_DX3B6Ays:NfOMySLWemg:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=8y_DX3B6Ays:NfOMySLWemg:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/8y_DX3B6Ays\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 13 Jul 2021 15:39:25 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/60edafdfca74780018ae9138?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"b46c4b6d1c477ee49e6337f08a117aab","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn11@2020_4/2021/07/13/17-22-23-605_c774016a5fb9b95b.webp","destWidth":1670,"destHeight":1253,"sourceBytes":245322,"destBytes":245322,"author":"insider@insider.com (John Haltiwanger)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/60edafd5ca74780018ae9137?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn48@2020_3/2021/07/13/17-22-21-952_f0656a1b7935d1d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn12@2020_2/2021/07/13/17-22-25-174_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=8y_DX3B6Ays:NfOMySLWemg:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn67@2020_2/2021/07/13/17-22-24-228_af407d328f53c209.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=8y_DX3B6Ays:NfOMySLWemg:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn24@2020_3/2021/07/13/17-22-22-677_b212119c70c9bab4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn83@2020_2/2021/07/13/17-22-23-761_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=8y_DX3B6Ays:NfOMySLWemg:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn12@2020_2/2021/07/13/17-22-24-345_cf165460ef71c06a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/8y_DX3B6Ays":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn62@2020_1/2021/07/13/17-22-21-600_3f56128a38e27293.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1626196914869},{"createdTime":"2021-07-14 01:21:54","updatedTime":"2021-07-14 01:21:54","title":"I'm a teacher in a tiny Alaskan village.

I&#39;ll take the things I learned from them and from living here with me wherever I go next.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/what-life-like-teacher-alaskan-bush-2021-7'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=X4RHEtHlsEY:F2gnGwr9li0:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=X4RHEtHlsEY:F2gnGwr9li0:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=X4RHEtHlsEY:F2gnGwr9li0:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=X4RHEtHlsEY:F2gnGwr9li0:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=X4RHEtHlsEY:F2gnGwr9li0:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=X4RHEtHlsEY:F2gnGwr9li0:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=X4RHEtHlsEY:F2gnGwr9li0:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=X4RHEtHlsEY:F2gnGwr9li0:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/X4RHEtHlsEY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 13 Jul 2021 13:55:01 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/60ec4c38ca74780018ae8d70?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"35b904ecaa938a03359331d10082e79f","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn32@2020_3/2021/07/13/17-22-21-224_197d6b47c5fd1812.webp","destWidth":2880,"destHeight":2160,"sourceBytes":232146,"destBytes":232146,"author":"taryn.mary.williams@gmail.com (Taryn Williams)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/60ec4c38ca74780018ae8d70?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn32@2020_3/2021/07/13/17-22-21-224_197d6b47c5fd1812.webp","https://i.insider.com/60ec4da3ca74780018ae8d83?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn59@2020_4/2021/07/13/17-22-24-121_1d3f6b2758c8d44a.webp","https://i.insider.com/60ec4ca1ca74780018ae8d77?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn42@2020_3/2021/07/13/17-22-21-921_37bcaecd9da114f3.webp","https://i.insider.com/60ec4cfdca74780018ae8d7c?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn95@2020_6/2021/07/13/17-22-22-146_e11e954cced1c075.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn12@2020_2/2021/07/13/17-22-25-174_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=X4RHEtHlsEY:F2gnGwr9li0:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn84@2020_5/2021/07/13/17-22-25-021_7351ca2768a1782f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=X4RHEtHlsEY:F2gnGwr9li0:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn35@2020_6/2021/07/13/17-22-23-847_9202ebcd6cb357a3.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn83@2020_2/2021/07/13/17-22-23-761_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=X4RHEtHlsEY:F2gnGwr9li0:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn3@2020_5/2021/07/13/17-22-25-086_69246639669ddea3.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/X4RHEtHlsEY":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn24@2020_5/2021/07/13/17-22-24-402_760cd6c70ecfc64e.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1626196914908},{"createdTime":"2021-07-14 01:21:54","updatedTime":"2021-07-14 01:21:54","title":"How one startup is turning harmful algae into plastic shoe parts","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-algae-blooms-caused-by-runoff-turned-into-plastic-shoe-2021-7","description":"<div style=\"position:relative;

Weber boasts a global installed base of 50 million grills, and commands a 24% share of the global market, <a href=\"https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-212480/\">according to its draft IPO filing</a>.</p><p>Notably, Weber has enjoyed some benefits from the COVID-19 pandemic, including higher demand for outdoor spaces and activities thanks to social-distancing measures and lockdowns. The company&#39;s revenue surged 62% year-on-year to $963 million in the six months to March 31, and its net income tripled to about $74 million during that period.</p><p>Weber raked in over $1.5 billion of revenue in the year to September 30, up from $1.3 billion in its previous fiscal year, making a billion-dollar public valuation for the company seem reasonable.</p><p>Trott, who worked at Goldman Sachs before launching BDT in 2009, has advised Buffett on several Berkshire Hathaway deals.

For $100, this has everything I need to make my favorite soups, dips, salsas, and more at home. Even though I&#39;m relegated to the role of my girlfriend&#39;s sous chef in our apartment, home cooks will love the simplicity, versatility, and easy clean up that comes with the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.williams-sonoma.com%2Fproducts%2Fbreville-control-grip-immersion-blender%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Breville Control Grip Immersion Blender</a>. </p><h2>What you get</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.williams-sonoma.com%2Fproducts%2Fbreville-control-grip-immersion-blender%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\"><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5df7d9e4fd9db264124e3363?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Breville Control Grip set\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The set comes with a motorized handle, immersion blender, jug, chopping bowl, and whisk.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Amazon</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></a></p><p>It comes with five major components - a motorized handle, immersion blender, whisk, chopping bowl, and extra-large jug.</p><p>The motorized handle can be used with the immersion blender, whisk, and chopping bowl, just click it into place and it automatically connects with whichever tool you&#39;re using. The motor gets up to 280 watts but can be adjusted within 15 different speed settings depending on how chunky you want your final product to turn out. While Breville makes more powerful blenders than this, I&#39;ve never had any issues blending cooked potatoes and cauliflower into a creamy soup. </p><p>The immersion blender is 8-inches long, allowing you to fully submerge the blades into deep pots and its bell-shape design helps increase blending ability without splashing all over your kitchen counters. The bottom of the blender has a non-scratch exterior so you don&#39;t have to worry about ruining your pots if you get too close to the bottom or sides of your cookware.</p><p>The whisk attachment is just as easy to use and clean. Click it into the motor and you&#39;re ready to mix, aerate, and whisk anything you need. </p><p>While it&#39;s not technically a food processor, the chopping bowl has stainless steel blades that will perform the same essential function. Click the motor into the lid of the chopping bowl, and it automatically connects to the blades at the bottom. Plus, each part of the chopping bowl easily separates when it&#39;s time for cleanup. </p><p>You can use the large jug to stabilize the chopping bowl or to hold all the ingredients as you blend or whisk with the attachments.</p><h2>How the Breville Control Grip Immersion Blender performed</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.williams-sonoma.com%2Fproducts%2Fbreville-control-grip-immersion-blender%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\"><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5df7dad2fd9db20484463ac8?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Immersion Blender motor\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>We were able to blend a corn tortilla soup (left) and potato leek soup (right) in less than 10 minutes.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Danny Bakst/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></a></p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.williams-sonoma.com%2Fproducts%2Fbreville-control-grip-immersion-blender%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Breville Control Grip</a> couldn&#39;t be easier to handle during testing.</p><p>The motor/handle is ergonomically designed for a natural grip and the material is soft to the touch. The button to turn on the motor is right where you&#39;d expect it to be when gripping the device, and you can easily adjust the speed with the top dial while you&#39;re still blending. This is important because you&#39;re not supposed to start the blender at high speeds right away but instead are supposed to slowly build up to higher speeds.</p><p>So far, we&#39;ve cooked several different soups with the blender attachment, including cauliflower and onion, roasted tomato and garlic, potato leek, and tortilla. </p><p>While blending time differs depending on how chunky you want your final dish, it never took us more than 10 minutes to complete the blending step of any recipe.</p><p>The scratch guard on the blender allowed it to glide along the bottom of our large pot without fear of ruining the surface of our cookware, and it was easily washed with hot water and soap. Additionally, we never had any issues with food getting jammed in the blender or the motor overheating.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.williams-sonoma.com%2Fproducts%2Fbreville-control-grip-immersion-blender%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\"><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5df7dc89fd9db242c77d102a?format=jpeg\" alt=\"soups\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>After both soups were blended to our desired level of chunkiness, we topped the potato leek soup with turkey bacon and chopped green onion, and the tortilla soup with chickpeas and diced avocado.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Danny Bakst/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></a></p><p>Like the blender, using the chopping bowl is also intuitive.</p><p>So far, we&#39;ve made a white bean hummus dip and a parsley-based pesto. The pesto blended relatively quickly, but the beans took a little bit longer to blend down to our desired creaminess compared to the soups we&#39;d made with the immersion blender. That said, it&#39;s not like holding the button down a little longer is very taxing so this wasn&#39;t too much of an issue.</p><p>For denser items like chickpeas, the blades didn&#39;t seem powerful enough to keep grinding at times, so we had to transfer everything to the extra-large jug and use the immersion blender instead.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.williams-sonoma.com%2Fproducts%2Fbreville-control-grip-immersion-blender%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\"><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5df7df49fd9db208b87d1792?format=jpeg\" alt=\"White Bean Hummus dip\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The chopping bowl is really easy to use, just put in all your ingredients and attach the motor to the top.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Danny Bakst/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></a></p><p>If you&#39;re pressed for time, you can always increase the speed of the motor, but again, gradually increase the power of the motor until you get to the speed you want. </p><p><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.williams-sonoma.com%2Fproducts%2Fbreville-control-grip-immersion-blender%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\"><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5df7df5dfd9db245752e32e7?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Chopping bowl final results\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Our parsley pesto (left) and white bean and rosemary dip (right) blended with the press of a button.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Danny Bakst/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></a></p><p>We haven&#39;t felt the need to use the jug as a stabilizer for the chopping bowl and have just placed the chopping bowl directly on the counter. In fact, we haven&#39;t used the jug much because we use the immersion blender mostly in our pots.</p><p>We don&#39;t eat eggs or whipped cream in my apartment, so we haven&#39;t had a reason to use the whisking tool yet either. There&#39;s nothing really special to this attachment but I can see it being useful for things like pancakes, waffles, and even desserts.</p><h2>The bottom line</h2><p>The <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.williams-sonoma.com%2Fproducts%2Fbreville-control-grip-immersion-blender%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Breville Control Grip Immersion Blender</a> has become our favorite tool in the kitchen because I no longer have to go out to try all my favorite soups.

Yet despite making multiple attacks runs on the Reagan, the Gotland was never detected.</p><p>This outcome was replicated time and time again over two years of war games, with opposing destroyers and nuclear attack submarines succumbing to the stealthy Swedish sub.</p><p>Naval analyst Norman Polmar said the <a href=\"https://www.19fortyfive.com/2021/01/gotland-swedens-stealth-submarine-that-sunk-a-carrier/\">Gotland</a> &#34;ran rings&#34; around the American carrier task force. Another source claimed US antisubmarine specialists were &#34;demoralized&#34; by the experience.</p><p>How was the Gotland able to evade the Reagan&#39;s elaborate antisubmarine defenses involving multiple ships and aircraft employing a multitude of sensors? And even more importantly, how was a relatively cheap submarine costing around $100 million - roughly the cost of a single F-35 stealth fighter today - able to accomplish that? After all, the US Navy decommissioned its last diesel submarine in 1990.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5442f8bd69bedd835fef1d8c?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Swedish submarine Navy\" height=\"1281\" width=\"2659\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Sweden&#39;s HMS Gotland with the USS Ronald Reagan in the background.\n<p class=\"copyright\"><a href=\"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:HMS_Gotland_with_USS_Ronald_Reagan.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">US Navy</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Diesel submarines in the past were limited by the need to operate noisy, air-consuming engines that meant they could remain underwater for only a few days before needing to surface. Naturally, a submarine is most vulnerable, and can be most easily tracked, when surfaced, even when using a snorkel.</p><p>Submarines powered by nuclear reactors, on the other hand, do not require large air supplies to operate, and can run much more quietly for <em>months</em> at a time underwater - and they can swim faster while at it.</p><p>However, the 200-foot-long Swedish Gotland-class submarines, introduced in 1996, were the first to employ an Air Independent Propulsion (AIP) system - in this case, the Stirling engine. A Stirling engine charges the submarine&#39;s 75-kilowatt battery using <em>liquid</em> oxygen.</p><p>With the Stirling, a Gotland-class submarine can remain undersea for up to two weeks sustaining an average speed of 6 mph - or it can expend its battery power to surge up to 23 mph. A conventional diesel engine is used for operation on the surface or while employing the snorkel.</p><p>The Stirling-powered Gotland runs more quietly than even a nuclear-powered sub, which must employ noise-producing coolant pumps in their reactors.</p><p>The Gotland class does <a href=\"https://foxtrotalpha.jalopnik.com/sweden-has-a-sub-thats-so-deadly-the-us-navy-hired-it-t-1649695984\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-cke-saved-href=\"http://foxtrotalpha.jalopnik.com/sweden-has-a-sub-thats-so-deadly-the-us-navy-hired-it-t-1649695984\">possess many other features</a> that make it adept at evading detection.</p><p>It mounts 27 electromagnets designed to counteract its magnetic signature to Magnetic Anomaly Detectors. Its hull benefits from sonar-resistant coatings, while the tower is made of radar-absorbent materials. Machinery on the interior is coated with rubber acoustic-deadening buffers to minimize detectability by sonar.</p><p>The Gotland is also exceedingly maneuverable thanks to the combined six maneuvering surfaces on its X-shaped rudder and sail, allowing it to operate close to the sea floor and pull off tight turns.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60edc15061b8600019f16d28?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Swedish navy submarine HMS Gotland in San Diego\" height=\"1330\" width=\"2000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>HMS Gotland in San Diego Harbor during Fleet Week San Diego, October 1, 2005.\n<p class=\"copyright\">US Navy/Mate 2nd Class Patricia R. Totemeier</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Because the stealthy boat proved the ultimate challenge to US antisubmarine ships in international exercises, the US Navy leased the Gotland and its crew for two entire years to conduct antisubmarine exercises. The results convinced the US Navy its undersea sensors simply were not up to dealing with the stealthy AIP boats.</p><p>However, the Gotland was merely the first of many AIP-powered submarine designs - some with twice the underwater endurance. And Sweden is by no means the only country to be fielding them.</p><p>China has two diesel submarine types using Stirling engines. Fifteen of the earlier Type 039A Yuan class have been built in four different variants, with more than 20 more planned or already under construction.</p><p>Beijing also has a single Type 032 Qing-class vessel that can remain underwater for 30 days. It believed to be the largest operational diesel submarine in the world, and boasts seven Vertical Launch System cells capable of firing off cruise missiles and ballistic missiles.</p><p>Russia debuted with the experimental Lada-class Sankt Peterburg, which uses hydrogen fuel cells for power. It is an evolution of its widely produced Kilo-class submarine. However, sea trials found that the cells provided only half of the expected output, and the type was not approved for production.</p><p>However, in 2013 the Russian Navy announced it would produce two heavily redesigned Ladas, the Kronstadt and Velikiye Luki, expected by the end of the decade.</p><p>Other producers of AIP diesel submarines include Spain, France, Japan and Germany. These countries have in turn sold them to navies across the world, including to India, Israel, Pakistan and South Korea.</p><p>Submarines using AIP systems have evolved into larger, more heavily armed and more expensive types, including the German Dolphin-class and the French Scorpene-class submarines.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60b859b6bee0fc0019d5b04f?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Indian Navy Scorpene-class submarine Karanj\" height=\"1287\" width=\"2000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The Indian Navy&#39;s third Scorpene-class submarine, Karanj, at its launch in Mumbai, January 31, 2018.\n<p class=\"copyright\">PUNIT PARANJPE/AFP via Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>The US Navy has no intention to field diesel submarines again, however, preferring to stick to nuclear submarines that cost multiple billions of dollars. It&#39;s tempting to see that as the Pentagon choosing once again a more expensive weapon system over a vastly more cost-efficient alternative. It&#39;s not <em>quite </em>that simple, however.</p><p>Diesel submarines are ideal for patrolling close to friendly shores. But US subs off Asia and Europe need to travel <em>thousands </em>of miles just to get there, and then remain deployed for months at a time. A diesel submarine may be able to traverse that distance - but it would then require frequent refueling at sea to complete a long deployment.</p><p>Remember the Gotland? It was shipped back to Sweden on a mobile dry dock rather than making the journey on its own power.</p><p>Though the new AIP-equipped diesel subs may be able to go weeks without surfacing, that&#39;s still not as good as going <em>months</em> without having to do so. And furthermore, a diesel submarine - with or without AIP - can&#39;t sustain high underwater speeds for very long, unlike a nuclear submarine.</p><p>A diesel sub will be most effective when ambushing a hostile fleet <a href=\"https://warisboring.com/chinese-subs-finally-get-a-shot-at-american-carriers-ac3fc030890a#.wqq3vuc11\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://warisboring.com/chinese-subs-finally-get-a-shot-at-american-carriers-ac3fc030890a#.wqq3vuc11\">whose position has already been &#34;cued&#34; by friendly intelligence assets</a>. However, the slow, sustainable underwater speed of AIP-powered diesel submarines make them less than ideal for stalking prey over vast expanses of water.</p><p>These limitations don&#39;t pose a problem to diesel subs operating relatively close to friendly bases, defending littoral waters. But while diesel submarines may be great while operating close to home - the US Navy usually doesn&#39;t.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/6078949574da0300181e1f1a?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Navy submarine\" height=\"1333\" width=\"2000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>US Navy fast-attack submarine USS Asheville and US 7th Fleet flagship USS Blue Ridge in the Philippine Sea.\n<p class=\"copyright\">US Navy/MC2 Adam K. Thomas</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Still, the fact that one could build or acquire three or four diesel submarines costing $500 to $800 million each for the price of a single nuclear submarine gives them undeniable appeal.</p><p>Proponents argue that the United States could forward deploy diesel subs to bases in allied nations, without facing the political constraints posed by nuclear submarines. Furthermore, advanced diesel submarines might serve as a good counter to an adversary&#39;s stealthy sub fleet.</p><p>However, the US Navy is more interested in pursuing the development of unmanned drone submarines. Meanwhile, China is working on long-enduring AIP systems using lithium-ion batteries, and France is developing a new <a href=\"https://foxtrotalpha.jalopnik.com/is-this-jumbo-diesel-electric-submarine-a-true-nuclear-1652659060\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-cke-saved-href=\"http://foxtrotalpha.jalopnik.com/is-this-jumbo-diesel-electric-submarine-a-true-nuclear-1652659060\">large AIP-equipped diesel submarine</a> version of its Barracuda-class nuclear attack submarine.</p><p>The advent of cheap, stealthy and long-enduring diesel submarines is yet another factor placing carriers and other expensive surface warships at greater risk when operating close to defended coastlines.</p><p>Diesel submarines benefitting from AIP will serve as a deadly and cost-effective means of defending littoral waters, though whether they will can carve out a role for themselves in blue-water naval forces operating far from home is less clear.</p><p><em>Sébastien Roblin writes on the technical, historical and political aspects of international security and conflict for publications including the <a href=\"https://nationalinterest.org/profile/sebastien-roblin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-auth=\"NotApplicable\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://nationalinterest.org/profile/sebastien-roblin\">The National Interest</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/navy-spent-30b-16-years-fight-iran-littoral-combat-ship-ncna1031806\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-auth=\"NotApplicable\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/navy-spent-30b-16-years-fight-iran-littoral-combat-ship-ncna1031806\">NBC News</a>, <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/sebastienroblin/#457ee8ba2082\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-auth=\"NotApplicable\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/sebastienroblin/#457ee8ba2082\">Forbes.com</a> and <a href=\"https://warisboring.com/author/sebastien-a-roblin/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-auth=\"NotApplicable\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://warisboring.com/author/sebastien-a-roblin/\">War is Boring</a>.

With the <a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/6415797/type/dlg/https://www.kitchenaid.com/countertop-appliances/stand-mixers/attachments/p.3-piece-pasta-roller-and-cutter-set.ksmpra.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\">KitchenAid 3-Piece Pasta Roller &#38; Cutter Attachment Set</a>, you turn your KitchenAid stand mixer into a one-stop pasta shop. This set comes with a pasta roller that rolls six-inch sheets of pasta to eight different thicknesses, a fettuccine cutter, a spaghetti cutter, and a cleaning brush. All of the pieces are made in Italy.</p><p>How does it work? First, you prepare the dough using the mixer, then you flatten the dough and feed it into the rollers on the 2-speed setting.&#160;This will knead it. You repeat the rolling process until the dough is smooth and pliable. You slowly decrease the thickness of the dough until it is at your desired thickness. Then, to make the noodles, you either feed it through the spaghetti cutter or the fettuccine cutter.</p><p>It took me some practice to get the dough just right to feed it through the rollers, but once I got the hang of it, it was easy and fun. I'm impressed with how durable the pieces are. They feel heavy duty, and I haven't had any issues with them in the two years I've had them.</p><p>I also appreciate that the attachment provides an excellent rolling and cutting speed, and the attachments are easy to switch out.&#160;</p>\n\tThe best KitchenAid attachment for straining\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/59b2bffc609c301b008b5796?format=jpeg\" alt=\"best kitchenaid attachments 2021 fruit and vegetable strainer set and food grinder\" height=\"0\" width=\"0\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">KitchenAid</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<h3>Whether you want to make your own sausage or you have a bounty of garden produce to process, the <a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/6415797/type/dlg/https://www.kitchenaid.com/countertop-appliances/stand-mixers/attachments/p.fruit-and-vegetable-strainer.ksmfvsp.html?\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow sponsored\">KitchenAid Fruit &#38; Vegetable Strainer Set with Food Grinder Attachment</a> can handle a broad range of tasks.</h3><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Handles any soft meats, fruits, vegetables, or cheese</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>Made of plastic, not suitable for all meats</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/6415797/type/dlg/https://www.kitchenaid.com/countertop-appliances/stand-mixers/attachments/p.fruit-and-vegetable-strainer.ksmfvsp.html?\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow sponsored\">KitchenAid Fruit &#38; Vegetable Strainer Set with Food Grinder Attachment</a> is really two accessories in one set.

It comes with a combo tool, cleaning brush, six pasta plates, a wrench, pasta ring, and auger and hook. All of the pieces store snugly in the included case.</p><p>How does the Extruder differ from the 3-Piece Pasta Roller &#38; Cutter Attachment Set? There are four major ways. First, unlike most other KitchenAid stand mixer attachments, the Extruder only works with certain models. <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/KitchenAid-KPEXTA-Pasta-Extruder-Attachment/dp/B003GWZ9ZK/ref=sr_1_42?s=kitchen&#38;rps=1&#38;ie=UTF8&#38;qid=1504635958&#38;sr=1-42&#38;keywords=kitchenaid+attachments&#38;refinements=p_85%3A2470955011%2Cp_89%3AKitchenAid\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">On the Amazon page</a>, you can type in your model number to see if this attachment is compatible with your machine.</p><p>Another way they differ is that the Pasta Roller &#38; Cutter is basically only good for making two types of pasta: fettuccine and spaghetti. The Extruder allows for many other options. Also, the Pasta Roller &#38; Cutter requires less effort to use and clean up. However, the Extruder is also more expensive.</p><p>A negative is the pasta ring breaks easily. To avoid this, you should skip the dough recipe found in the user manual since it produces a dough that is stiff and could lead to problems. Instead, consider using a recipe like <a href=\"http://allrecipes.com/recipe/11899/basic-pasta/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this</a>. Also, do not put too much dough in the attachment at once.&#160;</p>\n\tThe best KitchenAid attachment for milling grain\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/59b2c02a45e2382e008b57e4?format=jpeg\" alt=\"best kitchenaid attachments 2021 all metal grain mill\" height=\"0\" width=\"0\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">KitchenAid</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<h3>If you use your KitchenAid mixer to make bread and are always looking to improve the flavor profile, the <a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/6415797/type/dlg/https://www.kitchenaid.com/countertop-appliances/stand-mixers/attachments/p.all-metal-grain-mill.kgm.html?sid=bi%7C59b2b89b45e23820008b57a5%7C1626111553960&#38;cjevent=6ab57ce0e33a11eb80b8039b0a82b832&#38;cjdata=MXxOfDB8WXww\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\">KitchenAid All Metal Grain Mill Attachment</a> will be a real game-changer.</h3><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Easy to clean and use</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>Loud, has trouble with larger tasks</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/6415797/type/dlg/https://www.kitchenaid.com/countertop-appliances/stand-mixers/attachments/p.all-metal-grain-mill.kgm.html?sid=bi%7C59b2b89b45e23820008b57a5%7C1626111553960&#38;cjevent=6ab57ce0e33a11eb80b8039b0a82b832&#38;cjdata=MXxOfDB8WXww\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\">KitchenAid All Metal Grain Mill Attachment</a> is designed to mill any non-oily, low-moisture grains, such as barley, rice, rye, wheat, millet, buckwheat, oats, and corn. Do not put coffee or peanuts in this attachment because it could damage the grinding mechanism. Before you use the attachment, clean it with a mild detergent to remove any oils used to protect the device from rust. Also, the mill is not dishwasher safe so use the brush that comes with the kit to clean it off or wash by hand if you need to.</p><p>The mill can produce cracked to extra fine consistencies. The mill features symbols for the finest grind and the coarsest grind, and there are several notches in between. First, you choose a setting, put the grain in the hopper, and start the mixer at speed 10. If the grind is not precisely to your liking, adjust the knob until you get it as coarse or fine as you want. If the mixer appears to be overheating, turn it off for at least 45 minutes before continuing.</p><p>Those who enjoy multigrain bread and cracking grains for porridge will like that this accessory can mill very coarsely.

I no longer buy ground meat. I do it all myself, and the results are always far superior to what you would buy pre-packaged at the store. I keep my grinder in the freezer so it's always ready to go when I want ground meat. It's important to chill the grinder to protect against temperature increases that could lead to bacteria growth while grinding.</p><p>One of my favorite creations was half pork jowl bacon/half beef burgers. I also made beer bratwurst for the first time with spectacular results.</p><p>And, cleanup was a snap. All of the metal parts should be washed by hand, and I recommend cleaning the grinder immediately after use or rinsing it off at least. Otherwise, bits of meat dry onto it and are hard to remove.</p><p>I've used this attachment for three years now, and I haven't seen any degradation in performance.</p><h3><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/kitchenaid-metal-meat-grinder-review-2018-12\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Read our full review of the KitchenAid Meat Grinder Attachment.</a></h3><h3>Learn <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-grind-meat-kitchen-aid\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">how to grind meat</a> and <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-make-sausage-with-a-kitchenaid-stand-mixer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">make sausage</a> with your KitchenAid and attachments.&#160;</h3>\n\tSee more great kitchen buying guides\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/59a716b66eac401c008b6d69?format=jpeg\" alt=\"kitchenaid artisan\" height=\"1489\" width=\"1985\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">KitchenAid</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<h3><a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/best-kitchenaid\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The best KitchenAid mixers</a></h3><p>The best KitchenAid mixers serve as an indispensable tool as you bake cakes, pies, bread, cookies, and other delicious treats.

of the most menacing images of the Jan. 6 riots.</p><p><a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-capitol-siege-b6587af22fb1ef19b9cd7a7e21f51e16\">Douglas Jensen, 41, was wearing a T-shirt bearing the letter &#34;Q,&#34;</a> a symbol of the QAnon conspiracy theory, when he joined the mob that approached Capitol police officer Eugene Goodman inside the building and followed the officer up two flights of stairs.</p><p>US District Judge Timothy Kelly said deciding whether to free Jensen from jail pending trial was a &#34;close case,&#34; but he ultimately agreed to release the Des Moines resident on house arrest with electronic location monitoring. The judge also barred him from accessing the internet on any electronic devices.</p><p>The judge said Jensen&#39;s actions during his confrontation of Goodman were &#34;deeply concerning and quite serious.&#34; But he noted that Jensen is not accused of toppling any barricades, damaging any property or fighting with anybody at the Capitol.</p><p>&#34;That said, he clearly disobeyed Officer Goodman and other officers, and he did position himself near the front of a mob as he ran up the stairs toward Officer Goodman,&#34; the judge said. &#34;That may be some leadership, but only in the narrowest sense.&#34;</p><p>Kelly noted that a video captured Jensen referring to the Capitol building as the White House. The judge said he didn&#39;t believe that Jensen could have coordinated with others or planned an attack in advance &#34;when he had no basic understanding of where he even was that day.&#34;</p><h2>Lawyers zeroed in on Jensen&#39;s belief in the QAnon conspiracy theory</h2><p>Prosecutors said Jensen is a self-proclaimed &#34;digital soldier&#34; and &#34;religious&#34; adherent of QAnon, the conspiracy theory that has centered on the baseless belief that former President Donald Trump was secretly waging a campaign against a Satan-worshipping, child sex trafficking cabal of &#34;deep state&#34; enemies, Hollywood elites and Democratic foes.</p><p>Jensen traveled to Washington because he was &#34;all about a revolution&#34; and succeeded in his mission to become the &#34;poster boy&#34; for the events at the Capitol that day, prosecutors wrote in court papers. They argued that he poses a danger to the public and must remain jailed.</p><p>Defense attorney Christopher Davis said his client went to the Capitol to observe what QAnon promoters have prophesized as &#34;The Storm,&#34; the day when Trump&#39;s enemies would be rounded up and executed.</p><p>&#34;He was in front of everyone for the now disclosed silly reason to get Q recognized for &#34;The Storm&#34; that was about to take place,&#34; Davis wrote in a court filing.</p><p>Jensen&#39;s lawyer said his client &#34;became a victim of numerous conspiracy theories that were being fed to him over the internet by a number of very clever people, who were uniquely equipped with slight, if any, moral or social consciousness.&#34;</p><p>&#34;Six months later, languishing in a DC Jail cell, locked down most of the time, he feels deceived, recognizing that he bought into a pack of lies,&#34; Davis wrote.</p><p>Jensen faces charges including civil disorder and assaulting, resisting or impeding a law enforcement officer.</p><p>Davis said he tried to book a plane ticket for Jensen but wasn&#39;t able to, leading him to believe that his client is on a no-fly list.</p><p>Few of the more than <a href=\"https://www.insider.com/all-the-us-capitol-pro-trump-riot-arrests-charges-names-2021-1\">500 people charged in the Capitol riot</a> remain locked up while they fight the charges.</p><p>An appeals court ruling in March that led to the release of a mother and son charged in the riot set standards for how judges should weigh whether to keep Jan. 6 defendants locked up awaiting trial.</p><p>The appeals court found that the judge who ordered Eric Munchel and his mother Lisa Eisenhart detained failed to show how they could be a threat to the community, noting that they didn&#39;t assault anyone or destroy anything on Jan. 6.</p><p>Judges have since cited that ruling in several decisions releasing defendants.</p><p>But the appeals court also said last week that people could still be found to be a danger to the public and kept in jail even if they didn&#39;t commit violence on Jan. 6.</p><p>That came in an opinion upholding the pretrial detention of an Army reservist whose <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/capitol-siege-race-and-ethnicity-ap-top-news-riots-4644edb6f3fa819628760251c846a408\">co-workers told authorities was a known Nazi sympathizer who wore a Hitler mustache</a>. The judge who ordered Timothy Hale-Cusanelli locked up pointed to his violent rhetoric and found him to be a threat to a government informant.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/judge-fress-qanon-believer-charged-in-capitol-riot-2021-7'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=Cle4RfI8ALU:kqfJEPkjw8s:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=Cle4RfI8ALU:kqfJEPkjw8s:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=Cle4RfI8ALU:kqfJEPkjw8s:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=Cle4RfI8ALU:kqfJEPkjw8s:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=Cle4RfI8ALU:kqfJEPkjw8s:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=Cle4RfI8ALU:kqfJEPkjw8s:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=Cle4RfI8ALU:kqfJEPkjw8s:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=Cle4RfI8ALU:kqfJEPkjw8s:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/Cle4RfI8ALU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 13 Jul 2021 16:19:42 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/60edc21361b8600019f16d33?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"001dac32c775e911138f5c9503a0d916","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn54@2020_1/2021/07/13/17-22-22-671_b2e9f74f9b4513f6.webp","destWidth":1777,"destHeight":1333,"sourceBytes":226690,"destBytes":226690,"author":"insider@insider.com (Michael Kunzelman)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/60edc216ca74780018ae91af?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn99@2020_4/2021/07/13/17-22-24-522_e66f4e5bd181aa83.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn12@2020_2/2021/07/13/17-22-25-174_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=Cle4RfI8ALU:kqfJEPkjw8s:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn80@2020_4/2021/07/13/17-22-22-249_5353623514922e61.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=Cle4RfI8ALU:kqfJEPkjw8s:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn68@2020_6/2021/07/13/17-22-23-521_048c7e63be9ac10a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn83@2020_2/2021/07/13/17-22-23-761_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=Cle4RfI8ALU:kqfJEPkjw8s:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn87@2020_5/2021/07/13/17-22-25-683_72b582018bbdfb8f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/Cle4RfI8ALU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn28@2020_6/2021/07/13/17-22-24-830_3bd70704098afe41.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1626196914894},{"createdTime":"2021-07-14 01:21:54","updatedTime":"2021-07-14 01:21:54","title":"Eric Trump 'flipped out' and yelled at campaign staff on election night after he predicted they'd win 322 electoral college votes, book says","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/eric-trump-flipped-out-campaign-staff-white-house-election-night-2021-7","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f8c1c169e9fe40019009f63?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Eric-Trump-2\" height=\"1994\" width=\"3988\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Eric Trump hosts a campaign event in Monroe, N.C., on Oct. 8, 2020.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Peter Zay/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>Eric Trump yelled at his father&#39;s campaign data analysts at the White House as results came in on election night, according to a new book. </li>\n<li>Eric had predicted to friends the night before that his father would win reelection with 322 electoral college votes. </li>\n<li>&#34;We pay you to do this,&#34;

a White House official told CNN. </p><p>Republican lawmakers in 17 states have passed over 28 bills with provisions that tighten voting access as of June 2021, <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/voting-laws-roundup-may-2021\">according to the Brennan Center for Justice</a>, after former President Donald Trump and his allies waged an unprecedented campaign to try to overturn the 2020 election results based on false claims of fraud.  </p><p>And in recent remarks, Biden has also highlighted the growing trend of legislatures also passing provisions that add potential criminal penalties for election officials and give partisan state lawmakers more control over who runs elections and more power to overturn election results. </p><p>Biden will say that &#34;these new insidious moves to empower partisans over independent election authorities in terms of who counts the votes are new and extremely dangerous,&#34;

</p><p>&#34;If it were waving a magic wand to get voting rights legislation on his desk through any means, he would do that,&#34; Psaki said. &#34;But it requires the majority of members in the Senate to support changes to the filibuster.&#34;</p><p>Instead, Politico reported, Biden will call for a &#34;new coalition&#34;

email</a>.</p><p>It says that security experts at Facebook grew concerned about posts by &#34;domestic extremists&#34; spreading on the platform before January 6, 2021, when Trump had planned a rally near the Capitol to push his bogus election fraud claims. </p><p>Facebook executives, the authors write, &#34;floated getting Zuckerberg to call Trump to find out what the president would say&#34; at the rally.</p><p>&#34;They ultimately decided against the move, out of concern that the conversation would likely leak to the press. It could make Facebook complicit in whatever Trump did that day.&#34;</p><p>In a statement to Insider, a Facebook spokesperson pushed back against the claims though did not address the specific claim that the idea of approaching Trump was dismissed before it was broached with Zuckerberg. </p><p>&#34;No such discussion took place with Mark, nobody suggested he call, and he didn&#39;t. If Trump ignored the pleas of his own Vice President, the idea that Mark Zuckerberg could have influenced him is absurd,&#34; said the spokesperson. </p><p>The anecdote was also related by Bloomberg tech reporter Sarah Frier in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/09/books/review/the-ugly-truth-sheera-frenkel-and-cecilia-kang.html\">a review of the book in The New York Times on Saturday</a>.</p><p>Facebook executives, Frier wrote, decided not to act over the violent rhetoric. &#34;Instead, they sat at home and watched as Trump stirred up the furious crowd, and as threats in Facebook posts escalated into real-world attacks on the Capitol.&#34;</p><p>The book explores Facebook&#39;s failings in allowing extremist propaganda and disinformation to spread on its platforms, reaching millions of its users. The site has long been <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/bleach-miracle-cure-movement-powerful-latin-america-coronavirus-pandemic-2021-5\">accused of acting slowly and in a piecemeal way to counter the spread of extremist content, and lacking a proactive strategy on the issue. </a></p><p>A report by the Tech Transparency Project found that Facebook had <a href=\"https://www.techtransparencyproject.org/articles/capitol-attack-was-months-making-facebook\">been one of the main gathering spaces for the the far-right extremists involved in the Capitol insurrection. </a></p><p>The platform&#39;s CEO, Sheryl Sandberg, last year faced criticism for <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/01/13/facebook-role-in-capitol-protest/\">claiming that the disinformation that fueled the riot was mainly spreading on other platforms</a>.</p><p>The excerpt from the book indicates that top executives knew that this was likely false.</p><p>Facebook in its statement to Insider said that &#34;our teams were vigilant in removing content that violated our policies against inciting violence leading up to January 6th. We were prepared for this and have been more aggressive than any other internet company in combating harmful content, including content that sought to delegitimize the election.&#34;</p><p>The spokesperson pointed to measures including banning extremist movements such as QAnon from the platform, and banning Trump for at least two years for his posts during the riot. </p><p>Trump and Zuckerberg had an uneasy relationship during Trump&#39;s term, with the site one of the Trump campaign&#39;s key platforms for its propaganda efforts.</p><p>Since his ban and departure from office, Trump has<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-to-sue-zuckerberg-dorsey-twitter-facebook-social-media-bans-2021-7\">launched a lawsuit against Facebook and other tech firms</a>, citing his ban as well as alleging wider bias against conservatives.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-avoided-mention-of-possible-capitol-violence-to-trump-book-2021-7'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=gJbCNOl7YGk:vRkn8eTJQIQ:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=gJbCNOl7YGk:vRkn8eTJQIQ:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=gJbCNOl7YGk:vRkn8eTJQIQ:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=gJbCNOl7YGk:vRkn8eTJQIQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=gJbCNOl7YGk:vRkn8eTJQIQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=gJbCNOl7YGk:vRkn8eTJQIQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=gJbCNOl7YGk:vRkn8eTJQIQ:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=gJbCNOl7YGk:vRkn8eTJQIQ:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/gJbCNOl7YGk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 13 Jul 2021 13:35:15 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/60ed7d98ca74780018ae9089?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"5a094a6ddf1f3ee16b48fcebb1440e5b","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn76@2020_4/2021/07/13/17-22-26-304_af01247751da0eac.webp","destWidth":1777,"destHeight":1333,"sourceBytes":55420,"destBytes":55420,"author":"tporter@businessinsider.com (Tom Porter)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/60ed9356ca74780018ae90ab?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn87@2020_5/2021/07/13/17-22-22-116_5f8e13bfa272da66.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn12@2020_2/2021/07/13/17-22-25-174_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=gJbCNOl7YGk:vRkn8eTJQIQ:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn3@2020_2/2021/07/13/17-22-22-789_2f6f8edb45c954c4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=gJbCNOl7YGk:vRkn8eTJQIQ:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn31@2020_2/2021/07/13/17-22-25-773_b1ff504f7127f250.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn83@2020_2/2021/07/13/17-22-23-761_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=gJbCNOl7YGk:vRkn8eTJQIQ:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn3@2020_6/2021/07/13/17-22-23-842_be1867f01c67c4df.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/gJbCNOl7YGk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn99@2020_3/2021/07/13/17-22-22-559_535cb16abdaf21b1.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1626196914888},{"createdTime":"2021-07-14 01:21:54","updatedTime":"2021-07-14 01:21:54","title":"The 82-year-old passenger on Jeff Bezos' spaceflight still plans to take the Virgin Galactic trip she paid $200,000 for over a decade ago","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/jeff-bezos-spaceflight-passenger-wally-funk-planning-virgin-galactic-flight-2021-7","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60ed9520ca74780018ae90b5?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Aviator Wally Funk gives a thumbs up surrounded by other hopeful space tourists\" height=\"1874\" width=\"2500\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Wally Funk celebrates as the Virgin Galactic VSS Enterprise spacecraft makes its first public landing during the Spaceport America runway dedication ceremony near Las Cruces, New Mexico in October 2010.\n<p class=\"copyright\">MARK RALSTON/AFP via Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>Wally Funk is an 82-year-old aviator and the fourth passenger on Jeff Bezos&#39;
