(CDC/)</caption><p>Now is about the time that the annual flu shot reminder articles start popping up. It’s rarely on people’s minds in late August or even in September, but that’s actually the perfect time to get vaccinated. It takes a few weeks for immunity to build, so by the time the virus really starts circulating you’re already protected.</p><p>This year, though, we all have another disease on our minds, and the growing awareness of two overlapping, widespread viruses circulating at the same time has epidemiologists and other public health experts concerned.</p><p>“I’m very worried about this,” says Eleanor Murray, an epidemiologist at Boston University School of Public Health. “I would feel more secure if we were taking strong COVID-19 precautions, but with schools and universities and many workplaces opening back up, I’m not at all optimistic about the fall and winter.” Here are the reasons Murray and others are so concerned.</p><p>COVID symptoms might be mistaken for the flu</p><p>There’s a lot of overlap between <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/symptoms/flu-vs-covid19.htm\">the symptoms that each virus causes</a>. Both can give you a fever, cough, fatigue, sore throat, stuffy nose, muscle pains, shortness of breath, and headaches. But the outcomes of each disease are very different—COVID-19 is <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2020/07/coronavirus-deadlier-than-many-believed-infection-fatality-rate-cvd/\">much deadlier than the flu</a> (some evidence suggests as much as 50 to 100 times deadlier). One reason for that is that very few people have any kind of immunity to it.</p><p>The current advice for people who think they might have COVID-19 is to self-isolate, then go to a hospital if they start exhibiting serious symptoms like shortness of breath which could be life threatening. . But as flu season ramps up, folks who come down with COVID-19 symptoms might brush it off as “just the flu.” They might not take proper precautions and then spread the coronavirus to others. They also might be less willing to see a doctor for the flu, which could put them at a higher risk of experiencing a dangerous case of COVID-19.</p><p>Already overloaded testing systems are going to get even farther behind</p><p>The logical way to differentiate influenza from COVID-19 would be to get tested. Self-isolation in combination with easily available testing could be an excellent way to tamp down both viruses—according to epidemiologists, proper testing is a big factor in helping us return to relative normality.</p><p>But the United States doesn’t currently have that capability. We were already behind on COVID-19 testing in February, and <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/08/how-to-test-every-american-for-covid-19-every-day/615217/\">in the first two weeks of August we ran fewer tests than the week before</a>. Nonprofits, philanthropists, and healthcare professionals have tried filling in the gaps where the government has largely failed, but it will take time for companies to get systems in place to help everyone who needs it. And meanwhile, the current testing system is falling farther behind. Often, results take days or even weeks to get back, which isn’t a useful timeframe when people are already infectious before they’re symptomatic.</p><p>So when a flood of people start getting COVID and flu-like symptoms and want to get tested to see if they’ve been infected with the novel virus, the system isn’t going to be able to help them. “If people are going to get tested or self-isolating for any fever then the testing systems are going to become overloaded,” Murray says. Testing is the most basic form of pandemic control—it enables us to isolate the sick from the well—and it’s not a good sign that we’re already behind.</p><p>Healthcare systems could get overloaded, too</p><p>On top of a breakdown of the testing systems, there’s a serious concern that an influx of people with severe influenza could push healthcare systems over the edge too. Despite much drum-beating on the topic, much of the public is still unaware that seasonal flu is a serious affair.</p><p>“One of the common refrains we’ve heard from people is ‘isn’t COVID-19 just like the flu, and therefore no big deal?’ but the flu is actually a pretty big deal,” Murray says. “A lot of people get sick and die from it every year and this year is likely to be no different. Add that on top of COVID-19 and our health care and public health systems which are already overtaxed are likely to completely break down.”</p><p>Co-infections might be an issue </p><p>Diseases usually strike one at a time, but it is possible to get infected with two viruses at once. Having influenza and COVID-19 at once—both respiratory viruses—would be nightmarish. The real question is how likely that is to actually occur.</p><p>Co-infections are pretty rare in general, and in some cases <a href=\"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/08/how-will-covid-19-affect-coming-flu-season-scientists-struggle-clues\">being infected with one virus can have a protective effect against others</a> (for instance, having influenza A seems to reduce the chances of having a rhinovirus), though virologists aren’t exactly sure why that is.</p><p>“I do think it’s reasonable to be concerned that co-infections could be more deadly, although we have no evidence either way as far as I’m aware,” Murray says. Unfortunately, says Murray, this is something we’ll have to wait and see on.</p><p>The good news: COVID precautions are also influenza precautions</p><p>One small glimmer of hope comes from the southern hemisphere: Flu cases were at historic lows this year. Australia, which has already been through the worst of this year’s winter season, had 925 cases in 2018, then 9933 last year, but in 2020 only saw 33. A similar pattern has occurred in Argentina, Chile, and South Africa. All of those countries had over a thousand cases in 2019 and at least 700 the year before, but have had less than 55 cases this season.</p><p>Though it might be that people are simply not showing up to hospitals and therefore not being counted, it’s more likely that those countries ended up with low flu counts due to the social distancing measures they put in place for COVID-19. “In general, we’re very good at doing flu surveillance so I believe that the reduction in flu is real,” says Murray. “It seems reasonable to attribute that to the precautions we are taking against COVID-19 also being effective for the flu.” The US was at the tail end of what should have been a severe flu season in 2020, but when the pandemic was declared there was <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/index.htm\">a precipitous drop in cases</a>.</p><p>But that doesn’t mean this winter is going to be an easy one.</p><p>“It’s important to note that the precautions that many Southern hemisphere countries have been taking against COVID are stricter than the precautions we are taking in the US,” Murray notes. “We can’t necessarily rely on seeing a similar decrease in flu here.”</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 26 Aug 2020 18:03:31 +0000","feedId":410,"bgimg":"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/IfxeK3pSyVDVbu_lnX34Ge07BkU=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/XKXI4SR26NBITBYLGN654RIX4I.jpg","linkMd5":"1a7a2696b4f00435265c81ea62c907f3","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn73@2020_6/2020/08/31/05-06-46-412_0598fb713abc30f3.webp","destWidth":6000,"destHeight":4046,"sourceBytes":2102871,"destBytes":1104064,"author":"Sara Chodosh","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/IfxeK3pSyVDVbu_lnX34Ge07BkU=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/XKXI4SR26NBITBYLGN654RIX4I.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn73@2020_6/2020/08/31/05-06-46-412_0598fb713abc30f3.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598850394631},{"createdTime":"2020-08-31 13:06:34","updatedTime":"2020-08-31 13:06:34","title":"Clumps of bacteria could spread life between planets","link":"https://www.popsci.com/story/science/microbes-traveling-through-space/","description":"<img alt=\"The bacterial exposure experiment took place from 2015 to 2018 using the Exposed Facility located on the exterior of Kibo, the Japanese Experimental Module of the International Space Station.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" height=\"958\" src=\"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/3-IMJofwm1yl8tEVf3X4_3JHyEI=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/FYNG65VOEZB6PGPSPWY2QBFAJU.jpg\" width=\"1277\"/><br/><caption>The bacterial exposure experiment took place from 2015 to 2018 using the Exposed Facility located on the exterior of Kibo, the Japanese Experimental Module of the International Space Station. (JAXA/NASA/)</caption><p>For decades, astronomers have theorized microbes could drift through the vastness of space like pollen in the wind, planting the seeds of life across the cosmos. New research from the astrobiology mission “Tanpopo,” appropriately named ‘dandelion’ in Japanese, suggests they very well might be. That would make life much more common in the universe than previously thought.</p><p>“The origin of life is the biggest mystery of human beings,” says Akihiko Yamagishi, Tokyo University microbiologist, principal investigator of the Tanpopo mission, and lead author of the new paper. He says that the team was able to show microbes would be able to survive the trek from Mars to Earth without shielding from the dangers of space if they clump together.</p><p>To do so, astrobiologists took their experiments to space to see how terrestrial life holds up in this harsh environment, where the vacuum, lack of oxygen, ultraviolet radiation and extreme temperatures would seem to preclude it. In the new study, published Wednesday <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2020.02050/full\">in the journal Frontiers of Microbiology</a>, researchers report how a specific type of bacteria on the International Space Station survived these harsh space elements for three whole years.</p><p>First, NASA astronaut Scott Kelly affixed densely-packed balls of Deinococcal bacteria on exposure panels outside the giant space laboratory back in 2015. Deinococcus, which can be found high up in our atmosphere, is known for its unusual ability to resist genetic damage from high doses of ultraviolet radiation and its tendency to form relatively large colonies.</p><p>Later on, astronauts looked at the pellets after one, two and three years. After their harsh three-year sojourn, the thinnest layers of bacteria were fried by ultraviolet radiation. But the dead layers of bacteria protected the DNA of the microbes underneath from getting too damaged to survive: researchers found that all samples larger than 0.5 millimeters at least partially survived the high-altitude hike. Yamagishi and his colleagues suggest that a colony twice that thick—roughly the width of a dime—could survive up to eight years in space. That’s far more than enough time to travel from Mars to Earth, Yamagishi says.</p><p>This adds a level of feasibility to the panspermia theory, which proposes that life on Earth is the child of a distant parent. The idea is simple: Life did not begin on Earth but, instead, hitched a ride here from somewhere else in the universe. The study is “very well conducted,” says Chandra Wickramasinghe, an astrobiologist at the University of Buckingham who was not involved with the study. Wickramasinghe was the first to theorize panspermia in a scientifically rigorous way in 1974. “Over the past four decades, all the predictions of cometary panspermia have been verified. This is very unlikely to happen for a theory that is wrong.”</p><p>Manasvi Lingam, an astrobiologist at the Florida Institute of Technology who was also not involved in the research, considers this study to be “a valuable addition to the growing body of evidence that extremophiles are very hardy and able to withstand the perils of outer space,” at least over short periods of time. However, Lingam adds that the new research also has serious implications on planetary protection and biological contamination—extremophiles like Deinococcus may have successfully hitchhiked on past and present spacecraft sent to Mars, inadvertently spoiling the pristine Martian environment. If we do one day discover life on Mars, it may be difficult to tell whether it originated there or drifted over from another planetary body.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that bacteria can survive in space when shielded by a rock, but Yamagishi and his colleagues suggest bacteria might also survive by clumping together to build an “ark for interplanetary transfer” of life—a concept the authors have called “massapanspermia”.</p><p>Though this is the best-yet estimate of the survival rate of bacteria in outer space, the theory of panspermia remains controversial. There are still many unanswered questions about how the space-surviving microbes could physically survive the transfer from one celestial body to another. Yamagishi’s team and the Tanpopo mission will continue exposure experiments with different species and in different conditions in an effort to tease out some answers.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 27 Aug 2020 21:00:00 +0000","feedId":410,"bgimg":"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/3-IMJofwm1yl8tEVf3X4_3JHyEI=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/FYNG65VOEZB6PGPSPWY2QBFAJU.jpg","linkMd5":"808b96139205ce9adb42f9e288574cbe","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn24@2020_1/2020/08/31/05-06-34-968_8046f50f30ca89a4.webp","destWidth":1277,"destHeight":958,"sourceBytes":164240,"destBytes":121752,"author":"Paola Rosa-Aquino","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/3-IMJofwm1yl8tEVf3X4_3JHyEI=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/FYNG65VOEZB6PGPSPWY2QBFAJU.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn24@2020_1/2020/08/31/05-06-34-968_8046f50f30ca89a4.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598850394625},{"createdTime":"2020-08-31 13:06:34","updatedTime":"2020-08-31 13:06:34","title":"This motorized kayak can drive itself","link":"https://www.popsci.com/story/technology/kayak-motor-gps-standing/","description":"<img alt=\"Plugging a sod bank behind Fire Island’s new Old Inlet.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/yMemUTfAh3n5iJlolXoVXznhCTY=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/JBVHWQIDUNADFGW3SO2LI22QUI.jpg\" width=\"1500\"/><br/><caption>Plugging a sod bank behind Fire Island’s new Old Inlet. (Matt Whelen/)</caption><p><i>This story originally featured on</i> <a href=\"https://www.outdoorlife.com/story/fishing/fishing-kayak-you-can-control-while-standing-up/\" target=\"_blank\">Outdoor Life</a>.</p><p>Sight fishing in shallow water is one of the most exciting ways to chase fish on inshore waters. Kayaks are ideal for fishing in such places. They have a stealthy hull and shallow draft, but some models are difficult to fish from while standing up.</p><p>It’s not a boat stability issue, but rather a wind problem. When you stand in a kayak, your body acts like a sail. You will catch any breeze and get blown off target. And the wind is always blowing when you’re fishing near the ocean.</p><p>The new <a href=\"https://oldtowncanoe.johnsonoutdoors.com/old-town-sportsman/fishing/sportsman-autopilot-120\" target=\"_blank\">Sportsman AutoPilot from Old Town</a> aims to change this. It’s a large, stable kayak designed as a platform for a saltwater-grade through-hull Minn Kota GPS-enabled trolling motor with 45 pounds of thrust. You can control it with a remote (called a “i-Pilot”) that you wear around your neck.</p><img alt=\"A high seat and a wide deck with lots of storage space fore and aft make this kayak very fishable.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/yENRI5VwXzG-4Yse2qUjHumerKQ=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/OQL45CBITBFZTB3QISS7VAM7AY.jpg\" width=\"1500\"/><br/><caption>A high seat and a wide deck with lots of storage space fore and aft make this kayak very fishable. (Joe Albanese/)</caption><p>The motor comes with GPS sensors and auto steering functions that let you follow a course, hold a position, and keep your bow on a heading, even in heavy winds and strong currents. Since you control all these functions with a handheld remote, you can maneuver your boat while standing, thereby opening up a whole new way to fish.</p><img alt=\"The AutoPilot’s motor weighs 24 pounds.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/USsMo5mu1O_5Y4__xA1UP8XoeaI=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/NBX5VQY3CJF5HKQLLDANMLA2XE.jpg\" width=\"1500\"/><br/><caption>The AutoPilot’s motor weighs 24 pounds. (Joe Albanese/)</caption><p>I tested this kayak in the back of a new inlet cut by Hurricane Sandy through a barrier beach on Long Island’s South Shore. Strong tidal currents there have since dumped several square miles worth of sand into the bay behind Fire Island, creating wide, shallow flats perfect for trying out the new platform.</p><img alt=\"Long Island’s barrier islands split the Atlantic Ocean from the saltwater estuaries of the Great South Bay.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" height=\"906\" src=\"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/T6kKU5iKeWcr06QEoC3NLr_pHvM=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/7W6J3FLQY5A2DBAYZAJ4HGHIR4.jpg\" width=\"1500\"/><br/><caption>Long Island’s barrier islands split the Atlantic Ocean from the saltwater estuaries of the Great South Bay. (USGS/)</caption><p>The first thing I noticed about the AutoPilot was how little water it needed to maneuver. The kayak was built on a double-hull design that creates a deep cavity in the center of the boat. This fills with water as your weight presses down on the hull. Since the prop tucks partway up into this cavity, the motor draws less than you’d think. A buddy and I had to cross about a mile of water shallow enough that my friend (who was fishing from a Hobie kayak) had to kick up his fins and grab his paddle to cross. I was able to cross under battery power without ever having to pop up the motor.</p><img alt=\"The AutoPilot comes in 12- and a 13.6-foot versions.

Get the bigger model if you’re fishing bigger water. (Joe Albanese/)</caption><p>The second thing I noticed was how stable the boat feels. The AutoPilot’s bow is very wide, with lots of floatation forward, making for a very secure standing platform. The fishiest places we found were along the sod banks to the east of the inlet, where the current had cut nice underhangs along the banks. I’m a big guy, pushing 250 pounds, and was able to comfortably cast around the clock despite a swirling 2-knot current and occasional breeze that would have grabbed the bow and spun the kayak around if the motor hadn’t been holding on a heading.</p><img alt=\"It’s easy to stand up on a 37-inch wide kayak. \" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/8rAu31jCmsDNLO6C52y4ojgkseY=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/5YODXY6U3NASXFBVKFHOGWO7OI.jpg\" width=\"1500\"/><br/><caption>It’s easy to stand up on a 37-inch wide kayak.  (Joe Albanese/)</caption><p>The AutoPilot’s auto steering and spot lock functions proved useful and reliable when sitting down, too. They made it easy and simple to counteract the wind when I was fishing jigs in deeper water. I also appreciated the ability to hold my position at the push of a button, which made re-rigging, putting fish on a stringer, and other complicated tasks a lot less work in heavy current.</p><p>Electric kayaks are great for covering ground without burning calories, but they do cost more and come with heavy batteries and motors that you have to lug up and down the beach if you’re not launching from a boat ramp. I’ve mostly stuck to pedal kayaks because they are lightweight, and more reliable because they are powered by me—not electronics.</p><p>But the AutoPilot gives you a unique and effective way to fish that you can’t get on other platforms. Once you figure out how to use the remote (which does take a few trips), you’ll feel like you’re out on the water with a guide poling you around. It also fishes well in bigger water, where the GPS motor keeps wind and current from pushing you off target. It’s still heavy and, at almost $3,800 it is definitely not cheap, but it’s a lot more portable, versatile, and less expensive than a flats boat.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 28 Aug 2020 17:39:40 +0000","feedId":410,"bgimg":"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/yMemUTfAh3n5iJlolXoVXznhCTY=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/JBVHWQIDUNADFGW3SO2LI22QUI.jpg","linkMd5":"2466bb5cfbaf10b7f74a5db4accc2019","destWidth":1500,"destHeight":1125,"sourceBytes":226861,"destBytes":151764,"author":"By Nate Matthews/Outdoor Life","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/yMemUTfAh3n5iJlolXoVXznhCTY=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/JBVHWQIDUNADFGW3SO2LI22QUI.jpg":null,"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/yENRI5VwXzG-4Yse2qUjHumerKQ=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/OQL45CBITBFZTB3QISS7VAM7AY.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn46@2020_4/2020/08/31/05-07-02-683_0f794bb4346d750b.webp","https://www.popsci.com/resizer/USsMo5mu1O_5Y4__xA1UP8XoeaI=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/NBX5VQY3CJF5HKQLLDANMLA2XE.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn73@2020_6/2020/08/31/05-07-03-439_089b3d62b360e81f.webp","https://www.popsci.com/resizer/T6kKU5iKeWcr06QEoC3NLr_pHvM=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/7W6J3FLQY5A2DBAYZAJ4HGHIR4.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn55@2020_2/2020/08/31/05-07-03-487_ffb8ed910f3f5553.webp","https://www.popsci.com/resizer/iN0TNbFBN6nexeobHI9W8gqvS5M=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/4J33VOS7BJHDPOMD23UBEQ6XZY.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn16@2020_6/2020/08/31/05-07-02-334_f839c7d3bfe71dfc.webp","https://www.popsci.com/resizer/8rAu31jCmsDNLO6C52y4ojgkseY=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/5YODXY6U3NASXFBVKFHOGWO7OI.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn11@2020_1/2020/08/31/05-07-01-931_a2aac5d362347821.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598850394623},{"createdTime":"2020-08-31 13:06:34","updatedTime":"2020-08-31 13:06:34","title":"Flashlights for emergency scenarios and outdoor fun","link":"https://www.popsci.com/story/shop/flashlights/","description":"<img alt=\"Lead the way.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" height=\"625\" src=\"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/CLGDVVZ0FhCwaAbuWU56OEOroc4=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/PMRMJEVGSBEVVP2QBQD6ZGESAI.jpg\" width=\"1003\"/><br/><caption>Lead the way.

A controversial change in the CDC’s coronavirus testing policy makes it so that fewer people require COVID-19 tests, even as rates and deaths climb across the country with no end in sight.</p><p>Prior to this week, the CDC recommended that anyone who had been in close contact with an infected person should get tested, regardless of whether they showed symptoms or not. Now, the government agency says only folks displaying symptoms should seek a coronavirus test.</p><p>The updated guidelines, made in conjunction with the White House Coronavirus Task Force, are supposedly in place to put more emphasis on testing patients with symptomatic illness, individuals with significant exposure, and vulnerable populations, <a href=\"https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2020/08/26/politics/cdc-coronavirus-testing-guidance/index.html?__twitter_impression=true\">CDC Director Robert Redfield told CNN</a>. Today, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/27/world/covid-19-coronavirus.html?action=click&#38;module=Top+Stories&#38;pgtype=Homepage\">he clarified that everyone who “needs” a COVID-19 test </a>can get access to one, but not everyone who “wants” one.</p><p>Following the announcement, a number of public health <a href=\"https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/08/experts-question-cdc-changes-covid-19-testing-guidance\">experts</a> cast doubts about the effectiveness of this new policy. So called asymptomatic spreaders (people who show no signs of infection but still test positive) account for as much as 40 percent of coronavirus cases. And many argue that this new recommendation could falsely decrease the number of reported cases in the United States. The fewer people that get tested, the fewer cases the public will know about.</p><p>Further, Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a key member of the White House’s coronavirus task force, <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2020/08/26/politics/fauci-coronavirus-cdc-testing/index.html\">was under anesthesia</a> undergoing planned vocal cord surgery when the final decisions were announced. Here’s everything else you need to know and what it means for you.</p><p>What exactly are the changes?</p><p>Until yesterday, the CDC recommended testing for COVID-19 for all close contacts of someone who had the infection, whether or not they had symptoms. A big reason for this is because <a href=\"https://www.popsci.com/story/health/asymptomatic-covid-19-spread-who/\">asymptomatic carriers are big players in spreading the virus</a> unknowingly, leading to case surges after <a href=\"https://www.popsci.com/story/science/coronavirus-antibody-plasma-treatment-reinfection/\">weddings, parties, and gatherings</a>. People who didn’t know they were positive attended the events and spread it to other guests. Testing all folks exposed to the virus helps identify these potential silent spreaders. </p><p>The new changes to guidelines recommend you only get tested if you have symptoms, if you’ve been cozied up within six feet of a confirmed positive case for at least 15 minutes, or if your local healthcare provider recommends it. The updated CDC site reads “<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing/diagnostic-testing.html#who-should-get-tested\">not everyone needs to be tested</a>.”</p><p>Scientists say people with potential COVID-19 exposure should be tested more, not less</p><p>Unsurprisingly, experts across the country are already speaking out objecting the more relaxed new guidelines. Major organizations like the <a href=\"https://www.ama-assn.org/press-center/ama-statements/ama-statement-cdc-changes-covid-19-testing-guidance\">American Medical Association</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.idsociety.org/news--publications-new/articles/2020/idsahivma-statement-on-changes-to-cdc-guidance/\">Infectious Disease Society of America </a>put out official statements against the change yesterday.</p><p>“Testing asymptomatic individuals who have been exposed to a person with COVID-19 remains a critical evidence-based strategy for containing the pandemic and reducing transmission,” <a href=\"https://www.idsociety.org/news--publications-new/articles/2020/idsahivma-statement-on-changes-to-cdc-guidance/\" target=\"_blank\">the ISDA wrote in a statement</a>. AMA president Susan Bailey <a href=\"https://www.ama-assn.org/press-center/ama-statements/ama-statement-cdc-changes-covid-19-testing-guidance\" target=\"_blank\">went a step further</a> by asking the CDC to release any scientific evidence that supports the change.</p><p>One reason behind the new guidelines has been stated to focus on “vulnerable” populations, which would only be justifiable if there was a shortage of testing resources, says Leana Wen, an emergency physician and public health professor at George Washington University who previously served as Baltimore’s Health Commissioner. There’s been no such mention of such a shortage.</p><p>“If they came out and said [testing resources were in low stock], I think people would have a better understanding,” Wen says. “If that’s the actual justification, that’s understandable. But they should not be implying that asymptomatic people don’t need testing, which is what the implication is here.”</p><p>Another defense of the change is that a negative test might not mean that you are negative—especially if you get tested right after contact. But if that’s the case, Wen says, people who have been in contact with a positive person should be tested more, not less.</p><p>Other public health experts <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AbraarKaran/status/1298722181937946626\">affirm</a> that testing and quarantining if you come into contact with a COVID-19 positive person—even if you don’t have symptoms—is crucial.</p><p>Is the decision political?</p><p>Politics have played a big role in many countries’ <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/6-countries-6-curves-how-nations-that-moved-fast-against-covid-19-avoided-disaster-137333\">successes</a> and failures across the globe. And for countries that have successfully lowered their COVID-19 cases against the virus, testing has often played a big role. After all, trying to solve this dilemma without mass testing is kind of like <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/04/these-are-the-oecd-countries-testing-most-for-covid-19/\">“fighting a fire blindfolded,” </a>World Health Organization director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said back in March.</p><p>But, the more testing is done, the more cases we will discover, a statement President Donald Trump has made several times., <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/21/global-report-trump-says-he-ordered-coronavirus-testing-to-slow-down\">He has publicly stated that he’d like to slow down cases </a>to keep official case counts low. When questioned further if his statements were a joke back in June, he told <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-slow-down-testing-coronavirus-i-dont-kid/\">CBS’ Weijia Jiang “I don’t kid.”</a> Additionally, a CDC official told CNN that the new guidelines came from “the top down.”</p><p>“The idea that we should be testing people less and not more is not only pure craziness, but seems to be in line with Trump’s claim that he’s asked his people to slow down testing,” says Craig Spencer, the director of global health in emergency medicine at Columbia University.</p><p>George Washington’s Wen adds there wasn’t a press release or official statement that accompanied the website change. Instead the new guidelines were thrown suspiciously onto the website “in the dark of the night.”</p><p>NIH leader Fauci was not present at the meeting where the new testing guidelines were being discussed, and instead was undergoing a planned surgery. However, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/26/world/covid-19-coronavirus.html\">he had seen an “earlier iteration” of the guidelines and posed no opposition.</a></p><p>“I am concerned about the interpretation of these recommendations and worried it will give people the incorrect assumption that asymptomatic spread is not of great concern. In fact it is,” Fauci told CNN.</p><p>Several governors, including Andrew Cuomo of the once hotspot New York, have decided to ignore the CDC’s guidelines, sticking with previous testing advice.</p><p>“The only plausible rationale is that they want fewer people taking tests, because as the president has said, if we don’t take tests, you won’t know the number of people who are Covid-positive,” Cuomo <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/26/world/covid-19-coronavirus.html\">told <i>The New York Times</i>. </a>Kentucky <a href=\"https://wfpl.org/ky-governor-breaks-with-cdc-on-new-testing-guidance/\">governor Andy Beshear </a>and California <a href=\"https://abc7news.com/health/coronavirus-updates-newsom-denounces-new-cdc-testing-guideline/6389789/\">governor Gavin Newsom </a>echoed similar sentiments.</p><p>But even with these statements, local healthcare providers and state officials look to the CDC for guidance. Now, they are swimming in confusing murky waters when it comes to making decisions. Wen says, the credibility of the CDC, once the “premier health agency in the world”, will likely be tainted by this decision.</p><p>“If it’s not based on science, what is the motive behind this?” Wen says. “And what does that do for the credibility of this institution, and of public health in this time when we need that credibility the most?”</p><p>Long-term impacts of less testing</p><p>Without testing, asymptomatic cases fall through the cracks. And every time this happens, there’s a huge risk of spread. With less testing, Wen says, there will be more spread that could’ve been prevented, and we’ve already seen that happen in many regions of the country.</p><p>“We’ve already seen what happens when we don’t have the testing that we need,” says Wen, “which is community spread happens all around us, and before we know it, a single case turns into a cluster, a cluster turns into an outbreak, and an outbreak turns into an epidemic.”</p><p>We know that at least 30 or 40 percent of COVID-19 cases consist of asymptomatic carriers, says Spencer. So, a blanket statement of just quarantine might not be enough to keep potential carriers in lockdown. But an actual positive test can give people the motivation to stay in quarantine and not spread it further. The fewer tests we do, the fewer people have that bonus push to really stay in lockdown.</p><p>An additional repercussion of not doing enough testing is putting long-term cases, or people who continue to suffer even after they’ve recovered from COVID-19, in the horrible position of possibly never having a test to confirm that they even had the disease that in some cases may leave them with chronic suffering, says Spencer.</p><p>Spencer saw this firsthand in the treatment of patients during the early stages of outbreaks in New York City, where the patient obviously was ill but the resources to test them were unavailable. Now, in accessing care, these people have little evidence to hold up having COVID-19, and with fewer tests, more people are at risk of facing the same difficulties.</p><p>While it may feel hopeless to see all of this unfold, just remember that you can still take responsibility in securing the health of yourself and the people you love. Keep wearing masks, get takeout instead of sitting down at a restaurant, and take quarantine seriously even if you can’t, or don’t, get a positive test back.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 27 Aug 2020 17:50:16 +0000","feedId":410,"bgimg":"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/C--Py8vusEEaEj0VdqpgdnjbkO8=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/5RZOR5SVQRCB5EMMCTVK3F5NTU.tif","linkMd5":"ac3516d68afc75fd44cdec8930748174","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn10@2020_1/2020/08/31/05-06-38-104_9f38f031ee64eac3.webp","destWidth":2100,"destHeight":1337,"sourceBytes":4028756,"destBytes":379280,"author":"Sara Kiley Watson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/C--Py8vusEEaEj0VdqpgdnjbkO8=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/5RZOR5SVQRCB5EMMCTVK3F5NTU.tif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn10@2020_1/2020/08/31/05-06-38-104_9f38f031ee64eac3.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598850394627},{"createdTime":"2020-08-31 13:06:34","updatedTime":"2020-08-31 13:06:34","title":"How a 19-year-old lion fathered 35 cubs in 18 months","link":"https://www.popsci.com/story/animals/wild-lives-lion-king/","description":"<img alt=\"Lion tamer at work.

You probably don’t think about lion reproduction too much. Well, consider this:</p><p>If one female lion in captivity has a litter of cubs and they all survive and breed—for reference: zoo lions can start breeding before their third birthday—and then those offspring all survive and breed, and then the next generation the same, and so on, it would take about 37 years until that one family tree of descendants from that one lioness needed to eat the entire population of Los Angeles every day just to survive.</p><p>Dr. Craig Packer, Professor and Head of the Lion Center at the University of Minnesota, originally came up with this thought experiment. He used it as a way to answer a question on if lions have any difficulty breeding in captivity or the wild.

Or, more accurately, mathematical rules likely work with biological processes to determine patterns on animals—the leopard’s spots, the horse’s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_dapple_gene\" target=\"_blank\">dapples</a>, and, yes, those beautiful black stripes that contour and bend around the tiger’s orange fur.</p><p>Famed World War Two codebreaker and British mathematician Alan Turing first theorized in the 1950s that spontaneous patterns emerge when “chemicals [react] together and [defuse] through tissue,” writes Ian Stewart in his 2017 book, <i>The Beauty of Numbers in Nature</i>. These chemicals are also known by another name: morphogens, a term Turning coined. We should think of them as shape creators.</p><p>Over half a century later, scientists found support for these theoretical models in the real world. <a href=\"https://www.cell.com/cell-systems/fulltext/S2405-4712(15)00215-X?_returnURL=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S240547121500215X?showall=true\" target=\"_blank\">A 2015 study</a> published in <i>Cell Systems</i> used them to take Turing’s theories a step further to explain pattern orientation. Think about it, if math can predict an animal’s spots and stripes, why couldn’t it also tell us why a tiger’s stripes are vertical and an okapi’s stripes are horizontal? The most abstract level of mathematics can play out in the day-to-day lives of the biological world. <a href=\"https://www.cell.com/cell-systems/fulltext/S2405-4712(15)00215-X?_returnURL=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S240547121500215X?showall=true\" target=\"_blank\">Read more about the study, this way. &#62;&#62;</a></p><p><br/></p><p><u><b>The Saber-toothed cat</b></u></p><img alt=\"Los Angeles looked a lot different 10,000 years ago.

But rising temperatures are pushing the zone higher, forcing leopards and their quarry up the slopes, fragmenting their habitats into isolated summits. Rising temps also pull in competing predators like common leopards, which previously avoided the chilly heights in favor of forested hunting grounds at lower elevations. Humans are moving in as well to graze their ­domesticated goats and sheep, which sometimes requires killing cats who get too curious about the flocks. <a href=\"https://www.popsci.com/weather-climate-change-species-under-threat/\" target=\"_blank\">Read more about animals reacting to climate change, this way. &#62;&#62;</a></p><p><br/></p><p><u><b>Calls of the Wild</b></u></p><img alt=\"East African Cheetah, &#60;i&#62;Acinonyx jubatus jubatus&#60;/i&#62;.

(Shelby Snow /)</caption><p>The most dramatic way to fight a fire is from the sky.</p><p>An air tanker may fly about 150 feet off the ground at 161 miles per hour and can paint up to a mile-long line of retardant on the ground. A big <a href=\"https://www.popsci.com/flying-experimental-sikorsky-helicopter/\" target=\"_blank\">helicopter</a> could dump as much as 2,000 gallons of water to try to save a house. And smokejumpers fling themselves from airplanes 3,000 feet above their landing area below to snuff out a small fire in a remote area before it gets bigger.</p><p>Right now, California is home to two <a href=\"https://www.popsci.com/story/environment/california-wildfire-2020-scu-lnu-lightning-complex/\">historically enormous</a> blazes: the <a href=\"https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/\">SCU and LNU Lightning Complex fires</a>. The state is using aircraft to combat the two huge conflagrations. “They keep swapping positions for the second- and third-largest wildfires in our state history, unfortunately,” Brice Bennett, a spokesperson for CalFire, told <i>Popular Science</i> earlier this week. All the fires in the state right now cover an area larger than 1.25 million acres. “We’re dealing with just an incredible situation,” he comments. As of today, aerial assets in California have dropped 3.35 million gallons of fire retardant and 4.69 million gallons of water, according to Bennett. </p><p>California, of course, uses aircraft—it has both its own fleet and can employ contractors—to mount full-court presses on fires, but the practice is certainly not limited to combating burns in the Golden State. Here’s how these aerial operations work, and what it’s like battling blazes from the air.</p><p>Draw a perimeter</p><p>There’s an important, counterintuitive fact to know about those big planes full of retardant: “Air tankers don’t put out fires,” says Kevin Hopf, the chief pilot for an outfit called <a href=\"https://www.10tanker.com/\">10 Tanker</a>. His company flies DC-10s that used to carry passengers; the seats and overhead bins and other equipment have all been removed. His aircraft has five external tanks that carry retardant and three big clamshell doors on the bottom, each about 22 feet long, which open to deploy the red stuff.</p><p>For the most part, tankers like the one Hopf flies drop a line of retardant not on the fire itself, but in a place that will help steer or contain the blaze. The “firefighting mantra,” Hopf says, is simple: “anchor, flank, and pinch.”</p><p>The first step is to begin the line of retardant at some type of anchoring area that can stop the fire, a starting point such as a bunch of rocks. Then comes containment. “You flank the fire, on both sides, and you keep running up the flanks until you get ahead of it, and then you start trying to pinch it off,” Hopf explains. Pilots will then begin bringing the two flanking lines towards each other.</p><p>That’s a standard firefighting tactic, although he notes that truly enormous fires—maybe 50 miles wide, 100 miles long—would be impossible to anchor, flank, and pinch. “There’s not enough air tankers in the world to do that,” he says. “Now you start going for structure protection.”</p><p>On those occasions, on a big fire when he’s tasked with guarding structures, “you hope to find out the next day that they’re all still standing,” he says. “We very seldom see our work.”</p><img alt=\"A tanker fighting a fire in Arizona in June.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" height=\"1600\" src=\"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/Ij_3qqx7ZhEjG91y1vdogDrIhEM=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/URCJQVVV3NAWXBXNKWT53ANNR4.jpg\" width=\"2000\"/><br/><caption>A tanker fighting a fire in Arizona in June. (John Hall - JDH Images/)</caption><p>And it’s decidedly not about thrill-seeking or cultivating a cowboy image, says Brent Connor, the senior captain for <a href=\"http://www.eatanker.com/\">Erickson Aero Tanker</a>. Their fleet is mostly MD-87 aircraft that also used to be passenger-carrying airliners. “When I teach people how to do this,” he says, “I tell them that if your adrenaline is pumping, you’re probably doing something wrong.”</p><p>Deploy water from the sky</p><p>While the airplanes usually carry the red retardant, helicopters generally schlep water, which they dump on flames from above. Tanner McInnes flies a small, light helicopter—a Bell 407—for a Missoula, Montana company called <a href=\"https://www.minutemanaviation.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Minuteman Aviation</a>. If he’s dispatched to fly off towards a little fire in the forest—it might just be smoke spotted by a lookout, probably the result of a <a href=\"https://www.popsci.com/story/science/lightning-strike-sounds/\">lightning strike</a>—he’ll shuttle a fire manager in the front seat next to him, and two firefighters, part of a <a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/science-technology/fire/helitack\" target=\"_blank\">helitack</a> crew, in the back.</p><p>After assessing the fire from the sky, he might land the helicopter nearby and drop off the firefighters. The manager stays on board. If the authorities want him to drop water on the fire, the manager will install a bucket that hangs from the bottom of the chopper, and McInnes will grab what he can from a pond or river. (He says he’s never picked up any fish.) And since he needs to be able to stick his neck out and look down while he’s flying with that bucket, the manager can remove the chopper’s side door and stash it inside. “It’s actually nice, because it’s hot generally when we’re flying,” he says.</p><p>He tends to carry about 180 gallons of water in a bucket. Still, he emphases that “aviation does not put out fires—it’s the firefighters on the ground.” Take a small fire, he says, by way of example, with one burning tree: he’ll douse it with water, only to find that the flames have sprung back up again. “It’s amazing how much heat there is: A lot of times, if lightning strikes, they hit the tree, and they smolder for days before they actually show themselves,” he says. To take care of the problem for real, the firefighters on the ground might cut down the tree, and break it up, and stir up the soil to make sure everything is out, and dig lines around it.</p><img alt=\"An Erickson helicopter in Greece in 2009.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" height=\"1084\" src=\"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/jdJKyxXz_iDvhxWE6G8m_8wV9gk=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/XH2JE2AZOFEHFCI33K7UGXWDAQ.jpg\" width=\"2000\"/><br/><caption>An Erickson helicopter in Greece in 2009. (Erickson, Inc/)</caption><p>While McInnes’ chopper carries its water in a bucket, that’s not the only way to do it. Ken Chapman flies a strange-looking helicopter for Erickson Incorporated called an S-64 Aircrane, and to get the wet stuff on board, all he has to do is submerge a snorkel about 18 inches deep in a body of water. It sucks the water up through a hose, needing just about 40 seconds to fill up with around 2,000 gallons of fresh water.</p><p>When it’s time to drop the payload on a fire, Chapman’s goal is to deploy it from about 150 feet off the ground, flying at some 69 miles per hour. With that setup, as the water falls through the sky, it “loses its forward momentum, and rains down on the fire,” Chapman says. Dropping the water that way means that ideally there’s no “shadowing,” which is when the water smacks into just one side of the target. “If you come in low and fast, you’re going to paint on one side of the trees and stuff, and the other side is going to be dry,” he explains.</p><p>The most intense fire he’s ever flown was the <a href=\"https://www.popsci.com/story/environment/fire-tornado-2020-california/\">2018 Carr Fire</a> in Redding, California. “The thing that was amazing to me was how fast it went, and it was burning in the city,” he recalls. “This thing was coming into subdivisions. It reached a point, where they just said, ‘Go save a house.’ And you’d get a load of water and you’d come in and dump, trying to protect a house, and by the time you went and got water and came back, the house was gone.”</p><p>Jump out of the plane</p><p>Not all aircraft drop retardant or water. Some deploy people known as <a href=\"https://smokejumpers.com/index.php\">smokejumpers</a>. Pat McGunagle is a jumper based in West Yellowstone, Montana. He’s made more than 60 jumps, although the vast majority of those have been for practice—he’s a relative newcomer to the field. The jump height out of the Dornier 228 airplane he and the others fling themselves out of is 3,000 feet above the ground, although smokejumpers who use an older, round-style <a href=\"https://www.popsci.com/history-ejection-seats/\">chute</a> do it from 1,500 feet.</p><p>Jumpers aim to arrive quickly at a blaze in the woods—most of which get sparked by lightning—and deal with it before it spreads. They deploy in groups of two. McGunagle will jump out of the plane carrying supplies that include drinking water, food like beef jerky or peanut butter, solution for his contact lenses, and a pound of coffee.

(Piotr Wilk via Unsplash/)</caption><p>If you spend any time working on your computer at a desk, a monitor arm is an essential piece of equipment that will streamline your workflow and keep your space ergonomic and tidy. Not only can an arm lift your display off a surface, freeing the desktop up for other uses and reducing wire clutter, but it also brings the screen to a comfortable height and allows you the flexibility to pivot and view it from a number of angles. Mounting your monitor on an arm also makes your space easier to clean, and the result is an undeniably sleek and integrated look without the bulky, conspicuous factory base. The best part of all is that they’re incredibly easy to install on just about every monitor out there.</p><p>Take a look at this list of our favorite monitor arms currently available.</p><img alt=\"Tilts 90 degrees and swings a full 360.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" height=\"626\" src=\"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/jX7Z7OmUMvxeStr6mvn3gkAKQ-s=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/R3PX72XBOJBYHHEI4NRD62JIB4.jpg\" width=\"1000\"/><br/><caption>Tilts 90 degrees and swings a full 360.

(Bruno Gomiero / Unsplash/)</caption><p>People keep finding more uses for closed captions. They’re good for making content more inclusive and watching films in foreign languages, but they also allow you to enjoy videos and video calls in quiet environments, skim through clips more quickly, and even focus more on what you’re watching.</p><p>With more users requiring subtitles, the technology behind them is constantly getting better. <a href=\"https://www.popsci.com/story/diy/phone-calls-from-any-device/\" target=\"_blank\">Google Duo</a>, for example, is the latest app to test automatic closed captions, putting text on recorded video calls via the same artificial intelligence that powers the Google Assistant and the <a href=\"https://www.popsci.com/set-up-voice-dictation/\" target=\"_blank\">voice typing feature on Google Docs</a>.</p><p>Whatever phone you use, whichever apps are your favorites, you probably already have access to closed captioning—whether thanks to content creators or AI. It’s just a matter of knowing how to activate them.</p><p>On video streaming apps</p><p>Just about every video streaming app you’ll come across will have an option for closed captions. On Netflix, for example, look for the speech bubble icon. It may actually have a label saying “<b>Audio &#38; Subtitles</b>,” depending on your device. To change font and size, go to your <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/YourAccount\" target=\"_blank\">Netflix account page</a> on the web, then click your profile name and <b>Change</b> next to <b>Subtitle appearance</b>.</p><p>For YouTube, click the <b>cog icon</b> (on the web) or tap the <b>three dots</b> in the top right corner (on mobile) to find closed captions. You’ll get a list of languages to pick from, either provided by the video uploader or automatically generated by YouTube’s speech recognition AI—which may or may not be particularly accurate. On the web, you can click the <b>Options</b> link on the subtitles list to change the appearance of the subtitle text.</p><p>If you’re watching Hulu, you’ll need to find the <b>cog icon</b> on the playback window, and then tap or click it. Choose an option under <b>Subtitles &#38; Captions</b> (on mobile) or click <b>Subtitles &#38; Audio</b> (on the web) to get the text up on screen. Again, you’ll have more customization options to pick from when you’re watching online—follow the <b>Settings</b> link from the <b>Subtitles &#38; Audio</b> menu to find them.</p><p>Those are three of the biggest video players in the business, but other video apps have similar options, and they shouldn’t be too difficult to find within the playback interface. These settings are typically available on smart TV apps as well, though you might need to do a bit more digging to find them.</p><p>On video call apps</p><img alt=\"Video calls can be difficult when you're hard of hearing. Closed captions can help.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/TOl9Xp4H7rBA7Mi312ZYrq-GXH0=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/HV7B6P7ZSNB6XCC7POMVFLKHIQ.jpg\" width=\"2000\"/><br/><caption>Video calls can be difficult when you're hard of hearing. Closed captions can help. (Andrea Piacquadio / Unsplash/)</caption><p>Video calls always happen in real time, so people can’t bundle subtitle files with their footage. This means that if you want captions, you’ll have to rely on the smart AI-powered voice recognition systems built into your video-calling app of choice. This technology has been around for a while, but apps have only recently begun using it for this purpose. Still, you can find the feature in a couple of them.</p><p>Leading the way here is Skype. You can turn closed captions on for all video calls by opening <b>Settings</b> (tap your avatar on mobile or the three dots by your avatar on the desktop), and then selecting <b>Calling</b> and <b>Call subtitles</b>. By default, Skype will also caption what you say on the call, which can be a little distracting, but you can opt to have subtitles only on video feeds from other participants in the chat. You can also specify a particular language that you want captioning in.</p><p>Other video calling apps have yet to take the leap in terms of real time transcription, though it is possible on Pixel phones (more on that shortly). Google Duo is taking it slow by testing automatic subtitles on Android and iOS, but only for previously recorded video and audio messages.</p><p>If you use Duo and want your recorded messages to have captions, open up <b>Settings</b> (via the three dots in the top right corner of the main screen), then choose <b>Message settings</b> and enable <b>Captions for messages</b>. At the time of writing, this feature hasn’t been completely rolled out, so be patient if you don’t see it.</p><p>On Android devices</p><img alt=\"For when you're watching YouTube on a break but don't want to bother everyone else.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/ujyqWiYLSkReQ8wSrIUvkvOwinY=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/W2KK5JM2QNC3FCVHBBIOOO32QY.jpg\" width=\"2000\"/><br/><caption>For when you're watching YouTube on a break but don't want to bother everyone else. (Ketut Subiyanto / Pexels/)</caption><p>Android has system-wide closed captioning settings that you can find by going to <b>Settings</b> and choosing <b>Accessibility</b>, followed by <b>Caption</b> preferences. You can also change the text size and color here. Keep in mind that some apps may not support these particular settings or closed captions at all, though you might be able to find caption settings inside unsupported apps.</p><p>Google is also experimenting with a feature called Live Caption, which adds real-time subtitles on top of any video or audio in any Android app. Originally it was only available for the <a href=\"https://www.popsci.com/story/technology/google-pixel-4a/\" target=\"_blank\">Google Pixel phones</a> (from the Pixel 2 up), but the company says it plans to make the feature available to phones from other manufacturers—it just added Samsung’s Galaxy S20 to the list.</p><p>On a Pixel phone, turn Live Caption on by opening <b>Android Settings</b>, selecting <b>Accessibility</b>, and then <b>Live Caption</b>. In the same place, you can also choose to show or hide profanity and sound labels (for sounds like laughter and applause). Finally, you can opt to show a Live Caption shortcut next to the pop-up bar that appears when you press one of the volume buttons on your phone.</p><p>The next time any app plays audio or video, you should see closed captions appear in real time. Tap and drag the captions to move them, or double-tap them to increase or decrease their size.</p><p>On iOS devices</p><p>Apple hasn’t yet announced anything similar to Live Caption for iOS, but you can still enable captions for recorded content across the operating system. From <b>Settings</b>, pick <b>Accessibility</b>, then <b>Subtitles &#38; Captioning</b>;<b> </b>the next screen will let you switch captions on or off, and change their visual appearance.</p><p>As on Android, this will only work for apps that recognize the accessibility setting in iOS, but quite a number do—Amazon Prime Video and the default TV video app are two that will turn on captions in line with the general iOS settings. If you only want to turn this feature on while watching on the TV app, you can activate it by tapping the subtitles icon (a square speech bubble) on the playback screen.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 28 Aug 2020 16:00:00 +0000","feedId":410,"bgimg":"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/v80npt3xCjkI7rvpDUXrqZQuJXc=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/Z4DLQ2BSIVFCTCPBJ5BNRJQ6GA.jpg","linkMd5":"8c6c3012c6b6dd86f2210c20f58c3561","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn5@2020_1/2020/08/31/05-06-35-000_207756b8072d6d6a.webp","destWidth":2000,"destHeight":1500,"sourceBytes":380901,"destBytes":231676,"author":"David Nield","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/v80npt3xCjkI7rvpDUXrqZQuJXc=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/Z4DLQ2BSIVFCTCPBJ5BNRJQ6GA.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn5@2020_1/2020/08/31/05-06-35-000_207756b8072d6d6a.webp","https://www.popsci.com/resizer/TOl9Xp4H7rBA7Mi312ZYrq-GXH0=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/HV7B6P7ZSNB6XCC7POMVFLKHIQ.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn31@2020_4/2020/08/31/05-07-01-893_1f255061892d7d4f.webp","https://www.popsci.com/resizer/ujyqWiYLSkReQ8wSrIUvkvOwinY=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/W2KK5JM2QNC3FCVHBBIOOO32QY.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn87@2020_3/2020/08/31/05-07-03-402_4640965b90071079.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598850394624},{"createdTime":"2020-08-31 13:06:34","updatedTime":"2020-08-31 13:06:34","title":"Can you expose the truth in these two riddles?","link":"https://www.popsci.com/story/science/head-trip-where-truths-meet-lies/","description":"<img alt=\"Working through brain teasers like these keep your mind sharp.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" height=\"1280\" src=\"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/lBiRRb6nUGC2dkXlwFJBg2uE-_k=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/LBYZN5D365BX3JK45PDCZRDOQY.jpg\" width=\"1707\"/><br/><caption>Working through brain teasers like these keep your mind sharp.

Soon, you reach a fork in the road and another pair of locals standing guard, waiting for you to arrive.</p><p>This time, you know for sure that one of them is a lord and one is a warrior. And, as luck would have it, they know where your hotel is. However, you don’t know which is which. To find out which direction leads you back to your residence, you are allotted just one question for them to answer. What question do you ask? <i>(Hint: Decide on a query that both a warrior and a lord would have to provide the same answer to.)</i></p><p><details>\n<summary>Click here for the answer (Spoiler!)</summary>\n<ol>\n        Which direction would the other person tell me to go to get me in the right place? If the person you ask is a warrior, the other must be a lord. The lord would lie and say the opposite of where to go. If the person were a lord, the other would be\na warrior bearing the truth—but the lord would lie about what the warrior says. In either case, you would get the opposite of the correct direction.\n    </ol>\n</details></p><p><i>This article was originally published in the Winter 2018 </i><a href=\"https://bonnier.arcpublishing.com/tags/winter-2018\"><i>Danger</i></a><i> issue of</i> Popular Science.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 26 Aug 2020 12:00:00 +0000","feedId":410,"bgimg":"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/lBiRRb6nUGC2dkXlwFJBg2uE-_k=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/LBYZN5D365BX3JK45PDCZRDOQY.jpg","linkMd5":"22b3568feda1a190e5b2e50d72be17b6","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn84@2020_2/2020/08/31/05-06-35-089_6c9ed99a63cbc6ae.webp","destWidth":1707,"destHeight":1280,"sourceBytes":310781,"destBytes":287732,"author":"Claire Maldarelli","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/lBiRRb6nUGC2dkXlwFJBg2uE-_k=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/LBYZN5D365BX3JK45PDCZRDOQY.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn84@2020_2/2020/08/31/05-06-35-089_6c9ed99a63cbc6ae.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598850394632},{"createdTime":"2020-08-31 13:06:34","updatedTime":"2020-08-31 13:06:34","title":"Twinkle lights that instantly cheer up your home","link":"https://www.popsci.com/story/shop/twinkle-lights-for-your-home/","description":"<img alt=\"Brighten up your space.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" height=\"625\" src=\"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/eyF-0gePLgMp_B3Ghn_Sq3zOaWc=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/FXG677UZNZDU7KJXOFHFXYF47E.jpg\" width=\"938\"/><br/><caption>Brighten up your space.

It would give you a far better perspective of the world</i>—<i>or at least help you be a smarter pet parent. We’re here to demystify your animals (to some extent), while also shedding advice on how you can best thrive together. Welcome to Pet Psychic.</i></p><p>For the past couple of months, our pets have become our coworkers, confidants, and constant companions. With social distancing still going strong in many states, we’ve been spending a lot of time inside on our couch with our pets curled up next to us, providing adorable distractions all day long.</p><p>For better or for worse, though, <a href=\"https://www.popsci.com/story/health/social-distancing-covid-19-spread/\" target=\"_blank\">governments have started opening up communities</a> across the country. Soon, we’ll be headed back to our offices, and our pups, kitties, and other animals will no longer have our undivided attention day in and out.</p><p>What do we do to start getting our fluffy, feathered, or scaly buddies ready for more and more alone time? Here are a few tips from animal experts on readjusting to schedules that don’t include 24/7 cuddles.</p><p>Look for warning signs</p><p>You’ve probably heard about pet separation anxiety, but what does it actually look like? Some signs would be your dog or cat exhibiting destructive behaviors after you leave home, like pacing, vocalizing, trembling, or even relieving itself on the carpet.</p><p>Separation anxiety isn’t the only kind of stress that a pet might go through as you get busy again. General anxiety due to change is also common, says Rebecca Ruch-Gallie, a veterinarian at Colorado State University’s veterinary teaching hospital: Pacing, lip licking, salivating, and a flat or sunken body posture can all be clues.</p><p>Your furry buddies might not express these behaviors while you’re around, but you can keep a watchful eye on them with a well-placed camera. If you spot something surprising on the feed, share the clip with your vet.</p><p>“We’ve been able to diagnose many pets from a video that just bark a little bit right when their owners have left, and then they just do not settle,” says Margaret Gruen, a professor of behavioral medicine at NC State University’s vet school.</p><p>It’s especially important to look out for these behaviors if you’ve just adopted a shelter animal. One of the most positive things to come out of shutdowns is that more and more <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/coronavirus-pet-adoption-boom/\">people have opened their hearts and homes to new furry friends.</a> But shelter animals are more likely to have anxiety, period, says Sara Bennett, a professor of behavioral medicine at NC State University’s vet school. If they’ve entered your life in a time where you can shower love on them all day and things suddenly change, you’ll want to be extra vigilant in watching for symptoms of stress.</p><p>It’s also super important to remember that whether it’s a destroyed couch or a pile of poop on the floor, your pet isn’t trying to get back at you for leaving them, says Leanne Lilley, a vet and professor of behavioral medicine at Ohio State. Your kitty or pup probably unsafe or panicked, and that’s why they are acting out. So, try your best not to get angry with them, no matter how irritating they can be.</p><p>“Vaccinate” your pet against missing you</p><p>Since the shutdowns began, many of our schedules have gone to the wayside. We’ve traded our work clothes for all-day sweatpants, and happy hour starts the second the laptop closes. That’s all fine and dandy, but a lack of a schedule can be confusing for our animals, especially when they usually have free reign of the house from 9 to 5 every day.</p><p>Some ways to start getting your pets back into the swing of things is by “vaccinating” them to being attached to your hip, says Katherine Houpt, an animal behavior expert and veterinarian at Cornell. With a dog, use a sit and stay command and then step away to see if they can resist chasing you down. If they obey and seem comfortable, there’s a good chance your pup will survive the day without you.</p><p>Another way to ease your pet into the situation is by stepping out your front door for a few minutes and then coming back in. If you keep upping the time of the experiment, your dog or cat will eventually realize that no matter how long you leave for, you’re always going to come back and be excited to see them.</p><p>You can also help get your pets back on schedule by running errands around when you’d leave the house for work, instead of some random point in the day. If you’re generally out of the house for the day by 9 a.m., let’s say, try and make your grocery run then (even if that means getting out of your pajamas before noon).</p><p>Make sure you’re not the only source of fun</p><p>We love our pets a whole lot—but we we have other relationships and commitments in our lives. For our pets, on the other hand, they pretty much just have us. They aren’t texting their litter mates to catch up and swiping around on the furry equivalent of Bumble. No pressure, but you’re pretty much your cat or dog’s world.</p><p>That makes leaving them behind to head to the office all the rougher. Luckily, dogs don’t need much to be entertained. Fill up <a href=\"https://www.popsci.com/best-dog-supplies-toys/\" target=\"_blank\">a kong toy or use a puzzle feeder</a> to keep the entertainment going while you’re outside of the home. A timed kibble dispenser can also help your pet learn that you aren’t the patron saint of food.</p><p>“You become not so much the sole caretaker in the world,” Ruch-Gallie says. She also suggests leaving around special toys and snacks for when you leave, so that your cat or dog associates something positive with that alone time.</p><p>Keep up the fun things you did during shutdowns</p><p>If you’ve been taking your dog on longer, more frequent romps in the past few months, you’re not alone. It’s become a highlight in many pet owners’—and pets’—days.</p><p>Continue this new tradition of leisurely strolls filled with sniffing, socializing, and observing as life picks up again. Not only is getting out and about good for your health, it also does wonders for your dog’s welfare, Gruen says.</p><p>In this time of getting to know your animal better, you might also realize that you don’t need to crate them all day when you’re at work, Gruen says. Let them roam around in a room with some kind of monitoring system in place. “Maybe we can make some changes for the better,” Gruen adds.</p><p>If nothing else, the pandemic has likely showed you how your pet reacts to your presence. Don’t forget how much your animal loves you and is excited to share time with you, whether it’s all day or after work for a different kind of happy hour.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 26 Aug 2020 15:58:30 +0000","feedId":410,"bgimg":"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/yvqL7TQsYdEAkF6iJohvUbmKl0o=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/C7FNFNQUTVEVXI5T6R5EIPFIZE.jpg","linkMd5":"f1267eb82becef47bbe0afd6eb3eead0","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn2@2020_2/2020/08/31/05-06-35-479_040ddb100d10d7e5.webp","destWidth":1920,"destHeight":1280,"sourceBytes":173765,"destBytes":90624,"author":"Sara Kiley Watson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/yvqL7TQsYdEAkF6iJohvUbmKl0o=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/C7FNFNQUTVEVXI5T6R5EIPFIZE.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn2@2020_2/2020/08/31/05-06-35-479_040ddb100d10d7e5.webp","https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/COUYOTHJ5JGLXJJFJA7ZS7ZQ4Y.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn31@2020_2/2020/08/31/05-07-03-396_dd3a5be32b6985b7.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598850394632},{"createdTime":"2020-08-31 13:06:34","updatedTime":"2020-08-31 13:06:34","title":"The quest to snare—and save—the world’s largest owl","link":"https://www.popsci.com/story/animals/owls-facts-book-russia/","description":"<img alt=\"With a wingspan of 5 to 6 feet and a home range in Japan and the Russian Far East, the Blakiston's fish owl is one of the most secretive birds known to conservationists.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/LRg-pKPKQcvaQWYUPeCkjgv5LsQ=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/YB5ZRCR4KBG45HNF6Z6LSDYE4A.jpg\" width=\"2000\"/><br/><caption>With a wingspan of 5 to 6 feet and a home range in Japan and the Russian Far East, the Blakiston's fish owl is one of the most secretive birds known to conservationists.

Published by Farrar, Straus and Giroux. Copyright © 2020 by Jonathan C. Slaght. All rights reserved.</i></p><p><b>The fall traps did not pan out.</b> Either the resident fish owls were not interested in the frozen marine fish we offered as lures or the birds were unwilling to walk under the suspicious netted domes to investigate them. At about two o’clock one morning, a few days after the blizzard ended, Sergey and I sped three kilometers on the snowmobile in response to a beeping trap transmitter, only to discover a false alarm: ice had caused the net to sag and this tugged on the string that activated the beacon. Sergey, tired and frustrated and cold, kicked at the frame, breaking it, then threw the remains into the forest. Thus concluded the fall trap experiment.</p><p>The capture learning curve was steep. There were multiple nuances specific to each trap and to each capture site. Since late February, we’d had a few very near misses. When we started out the season, we thought that four owl captures seemed like a reasonable target, but I was ready to backtrack on that goal with the realization that simply learning how to safely and efficiently catch these birds would be success enough for me for this year. If we had one or two captures to show for it at the end of the season, after all these failures, I would be satisfied. We were well past the midway point of the field season; if the weather held, we’d have three, possibly four, weeks left before the capture window closed. After that, spring would bring unstable ice, rising waters, and unsuitable conditions to trap fish owls.</p><p>The pattern of no owls, poor sleep, second-guessing, and general stagnation continued on for more than a week. I felt trapped, more so knowing that we really were trapped. Even if we wanted to throw up our hands, leave, and start fresh as we had when we left Serebryanka, we could not: our truck was still stuck in the snow a kilometer and a half away. I tried changing my outlook. We’d still made some progress this year, even if we hadn’t caught any owls. It had been arrogant of me to think we could stroll up to some of the least-studied birds in Northeast Asia and assume they’d hand us their secrets.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><b>It was right around this time, </b>when I’d come to terms with our failures, that we caught our first owl. Anatoliy slapped me on the shoulder and told me he knew it all along—all I had needed to do was change my attitude. But in reality, we’d improved our trap. Up until this capture, we’d placed our noose carpets along the riverbank in areas we hoped the owls would land, which was inefficient. Our modification, something novel enough that we were able to later publish a description of it in a scientific journal, coaxed the owls to land where we wanted them to. We created a prey enclosure: an open-top mesh box about a meter long and thirteen centimeters tall, constructed from material left over from our noose carpets. We placed the box in shallow water no more than ten centimeters deep, sprinkled the bottom with pebbles so that from above it looked like any other stretch of river, and then filled it with as many fish as we could catch—usually fifteen or twenty salmon smolt. Then we set a single noose carpet on the closest part of the riverbank. The owl would see the fish, approach for a closer look, and get caught.</p><img alt=\"&#60;i&#62;Owls of the Eastern Ice&#60;/i&#62; by Jonathan Slaght.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/8RckKFtk67jcakcXUe5rZyavv3k=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/UM7Z37RRIBA3PC5LE2EUHLYVM4.jpg\" width=\"651\"/><br/><caption>&#60;i&#62;Owls of the Eastern Ice&#60;/i&#62; by Jonathan Slaght. (Farrar, Straus, and Giroux/)</caption><p>Masu salmon, the species most common in these rivers at this time of year, are among the smallest of all salmon. Full-sized individuals reach about half a meter in length and weigh about two kilograms, or more than half the weight of an adult fish owl. The masu have the most constricted range of any Pacific salmon, largely confined to the Sea of Japan, around the island of Sakhalin, and in western Kamchatka. Like many salmon, juvenile masu spend several years in freshwater systems before migrating to the sea, and the coastal rivers of Primorye are full of these pencil-length fish. As a result, this abundant species is a critical resource for fish owls in winter. Masu are also an important food source for local villagers, who can catch scores of them in a leisurely day of ice fishing. There is a misconception among locals that the small masu found in winter—which they call pestrushka— are a different species entirely from the larger fish—called sima— that come in summer to spawn. This complicates management of this species, as the same person who recognizes the commercial and ecological importance of sima may view the pestrushka as a common species that can be exploited.</p><p>The second night after we arranged this trap configuration, the male fish owl of the Faata River pair approached the enclosure and ate half the salmon inside before stumbling onto the noose carpet on the bank and engaging the trap transmitter. We were eating dinner by kerosene lantern light, as the hydroelectric plant no longer generated electricity, when it sounded. Despite nothing but false alarms so far, we treated every trigger with dead seriousness. Sergey and I stared for a second at the receiver and its regular, confident beeps, then locked eyes and flew out the door in a tumult of down jackets, hip waders, and uninhibited urgency.</p><p>We approached the trap, a few hundred meters away, on skis. Up ahead I saw Sergey’s spotlight reveal a fish owl sitting on the bank, watching us. Like one of Jim Henson’s darker creations, this was a goblin bird with mottled brown feathers puffed out, back hunched, and ear tufts erect and menacing. I’d seen other owl species adopt this posture in order to look bigger and more threatening to an aggressor, and it was working: this was a creature braced for battle. I was taken aback, as I still am every time I see one of these birds, by how enormous it was. The beast stood immobile, glaring at us with yellow eyes in the winter dark and illuminated unevenly by Sergey’s light as our pace quickened. Everything was silent except for the rhythmic friction of skis on snow and our gasps of exhaustion. The urgency to reach the owl before it freed itself was palpable.</p><p>My heart stopped as the fish owl pivoted and took to the air in retreat, but the weight of the noose carpet held and drew the bird softly back to ground. The huge owl moved away from us with awkward bounds along the broad, snowy bank, dragging the noose carpet with it, until finally, when we were only meters away, the raptor spun onto its back on the river’s edge. It lay there facing us, talons extended and agape, ready to shred any flesh within striking distance.</p><p>In the off-season, I’d trained in raptor handling at The Raptor Center at the University of Minnesota and had learned that hesitation with a defensive raptor doesn’t do anyone any good. I swooped my arm in a fluid motion the moment I was within reach, scooping the bird up by its extended legs. Upside down and confused, the owl relaxed its wings, and I used my free arm to tuck them first against its body and then the body against me as though holding a swaddled newborn child. The owl was ours.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 28 Aug 2020 18:00:00 +0000","feedId":410,"bgimg":"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/LRg-pKPKQcvaQWYUPeCkjgv5LsQ=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/YB5ZRCR4KBG45HNF6Z6LSDYE4A.jpg","linkMd5":"f0b7bf16449148d5ee10ee63c530667d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn80@2020_4/2020/08/31/05-06-35-097_2ca835b976c1a523.webp","destWidth":2000,"destHeight":1333,"sourceBytes":339187,"destBytes":311422,"author":"Jonathan Slaght","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/LRg-pKPKQcvaQWYUPeCkjgv5LsQ=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/YB5ZRCR4KBG45HNF6Z6LSDYE4A.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn80@2020_4/2020/08/31/05-06-35-097_2ca835b976c1a523.webp","https://www.popsci.com/resizer/8RckKFtk67jcakcXUe5rZyavv3k=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/UM7Z37RRIBA3PC5LE2EUHLYVM4.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn32@2020_1/2020/08/31/05-07-01-991_78fdfb7ad5a8f0f7.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598850394622},{"createdTime":"2020-08-31 13:06:34","updatedTime":"2020-08-31 13:06:34","title":"Make every project a breeze with the right miter saw ","link":"https://www.popsci.com/story/shop/miter-saw/","description":"<img alt=\"Great for woodworking.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" height=\"625\" src=\"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/-_SPOd5Q5BuaEeOauaEAP2m_zuY=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/XVVWL57PZJHZDDEY3QJF3PPXG4.jpg\" width=\"938\"/><br/><caption>Great for woodworking.

I need somebody... Help!\" ( benjamin lehman / Unsplash/)</caption><p>No PC is truly silent, but your computer shouldn’t be noisier than your lawnmower. If you have to turn up your music just to drown out the whirring or grinding noises your computer makes, you may want to look into that—it could be the first signal of some serious problems.</p><p>Knowing how to tell different hard drive noises apart and learning what they might mean, can save your computer. Or at least give you an unequivocal pass to buy a new one.</p><p>Clicking or grinding noises</p><p>Let’s start with the most worrisome sound. If your computer starts to click, grind, or make any sort of low-pitched buzzing noise, you should stop what you’re doing and check the hard drive. This sound could indicate a dying disk. Do not ignore this sound.</p><p>To check your drive’s health, I recommend a third-party tool like <a href=\"https://crystalmark.info/en/software/crystaldiskinfo/\" target=\"_blank\">CrystalDiskInfo</a> (Windows) or <a href=\"https://binaryfruit.com/drivedx\" target=\"_blank\">DriveDx</a> (macOS). Fire up the program, click on each of your drives in the menu, and make sure they’re all listed as “Good.” If it indicates your drive is anything less than that, you should back up all your data as soon as possible. You may still have some time to do so—occasionally a drive marked “Caution” can still run for years, but if it’s making noises, the drive’s death might be close. Once all your files are safe, consider replacing your drive with an <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Crucial-MX500-500GB-NAND-Internal/dp/B0786QNS9B\" target=\"_blank\">SSD</a>—not only will it likely last longer, but it’ll make your computer feel much faster. If your hard drives are healthy, take the incident as a warning and avoid any unpleasant surprises by <a href=\"https://www.popsci.com/back-up-and-protect-your-data/\" target=\"_blank\">backing up your data regularly</a>, because as it happens to any living creature, all hard drives will die one day.</p><p>One you’ve ruled out your hard drive as the culprit, you’ll need to dig a little deeper to find the source of that clicking sound. If your computer still has a DVD drive, then it could be in the process of failing, and needs repair <a href=\"https://www.popsci.com/repair-or-replace-computer/\" target=\"_blank\">or replacement</a>.</p><p>Finally, in a lot of desktop PCs, a clicking noise could just mean a cable has gotten too close to a fan, and is getting hit repeatedly by the blades. If you’re comfortable with a screwdriver, open up your PC and make sure the fans are clear of obstructions.</p><p>Loud whirring noises</p><p>If there’s one sound every computer user knows well, it’s the loud whoosh that comes from an overzealous fan running at full speed. On a desktop PC, this will likely be low-to-medium pitch like the video above, and on a laptop, it could be higher-pitched and much more annoying. The smaller the fan, the louder and higher pitched that noise will be.</p><p>If you’re hearing this, there’s a very good chance your machine just needs some cooling adjustment. You might also want to check your hard drive’s health, just in case, since <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGygwiprEbA\" target=\"_blank\">a drive spinning up and down repeatedly</a> could create a similar sound. Finally, check to see if there’s a disc spinning in the DVD drive—sometimes those can be obnoxiously loud even if they’re working properly.</p><p>If your fans are indeed too loud, start by <b>opening Task Manager in Windows (Ctrl+Shift+Esc) or Activity Monitor in macOS (under Applications &#62; Utilities)</b> and see if any applications are taking up a large portion of your CPU. If your computer’s working hard, the fans will work hard to cool it, so you may have a program running in the background you forgot about, or malware eating up resources without you knowing. Close the offending program or <a href=\"https://www.popsci.com/remove-malware-from-computer/\" target=\"_blank\">run a malware scan</a> to see if that helps.</p><p>If your computer is idle and still making fan noise, it could be overheating. A program like <a href=\"https://www.alcpu.com/CoreTemp/\" target=\"_blank\">Core Temp</a> (Windows) or <a href=\"https://www.fannywidget.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Fanny</a> (macOS) can tell you if your CPU is running hot. As a ballpark, if you aren’t running anything strenuous and your CPU is 70 degrees celsius or higher, I’d say that’s abnormal, and will likely cause excessive fan noise. If you’re using your laptop in bed, make sure to put a tray or anything solid under it—your clothes, skin or blankets might be preventing the system from cooling off, making the fans work harder and louder. The same happens with accumulated dust, so give the fan grilles a few passes with a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Strong-Cleaning-Screens-Photographic-Equipment/dp/B01D9OXY6K\" target=\"_blank\">dust blower</a>, or better yet, an <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/XPOWER-Airrow-Multi-Use-Electric-Computer/dp/B01BI4UQK0\" target=\"_blank\">electric duster</a>. If you feel comfortable, you might even want to open up your machine and wipe the dust off the fan with a clean microfiber cloth.</p><p>Finally, if you have a desktop PC—especially one you built yourself—you may just need to adjust the fan curves in the BIOS. Some of your fans may be running at 75% or 100% all the time by default, which is unnecessary. Or, the curves may be set in a weird spot that causes the fans to constantly ramp up for a few seconds to cool the CPU, but then they ramp back down, allowing the CPU to get hot again. Press *Delete* as your computer starts to enter the BIOS screen, and look for any fan control settings you can play with—try a lower setting, but don’t set them too low, lest your temperatures get too high.</p><p>Sounds coming from your speakers, even when you aren’t playing anything</p><p>Put your ear closer to the sound—is it coming from inside your computer or is it coming from the speakers? Speakers are supposed to make sound, but if you’re hearing noise from them even when your computer isn’t playing audio, something might be wrong. Make sure the speaker cable is plugged all the way in to your PC—you’ll usually hear a click that tells you the cable is fully connected, but sometimes you have to really shove it to get that last millimeter in. If that doesn’t work, you can troubleshoot your speakers by plugging them into another device (like your phone) to see if the sound persists. The problem could be in your speaker’s cable, or it could just be feedback from the internals of your PC, in which case a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/FiiO-E10K-Headphone-Amplifier-Black/dp/B00LP3AMC2\" target=\"_blank\">USB sound card, also known as a DAC</a>, might help.</p><p>You might also be experiencing a <a href=\"https://www.techhive.com/article/3063590/how-to-get-rid-of-hum-and-eliminate-other-noises-from-your-audio-and-video-systems.html\" target=\"_blank\">ground loop</a>, in which case a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/RadioShack-System-Isolator-Electric-reducer/dp/B002YGM5D8\" target=\"_blank\">ground loop isolator</a> can reduce the noise. I’ve even had speakers that <a href=\"https://www.seattletimes.com/business/computer-speakers-capturing-radio-signal/\" target=\"_blank\">picked up faint radio signals</a> due to poorly shielded cables, which is a remarkably spooky experience.</p><p>Ultimately, there are so many things that can cause unwanted noise from speakers that we could probably write a whole article on the subject—but if you play around with your connections, you may be able to narrow down the source, and replace the offending component.</p><p>Buzzing or screeching noises</p><p>If none of the above have fixed the problem, but you’re still hearing a buzzing sound, it could be just about anything. Heck, if they’re mild enough, any of the above problems could be described as “buzzing,” so check your hard drive and running processes before you move on.</p><p>Once you’ve discarded all the scenarios above, my first guess would be that you’re experiencing coil whine—one of my least favorite noises in computing, since there’s often little you can do about it.</p><p>Coil whine happens when the coils in your components start vibrating at just the right frequency to start making a very annoying noise. It can be anywhere from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kjhQrOtdF8\" target=\"_blank\">a low-pitched buzz</a> to <a href=\"https://youtu.be/HP73edpQwgc?t=105\" target=\"_blank\">a high pitched squeal</a>, and often happens when your computer is under load. If you can pinpoint the source, you might be able to mitigate the noise, at least to some degree. For example, in gaming PCs, coil whine commonly comes from the graphics card when it’s doing a lot of work, in which case you can decrease your graphics settings or turn on VSync to lighten the load. I’ve also heard coil whine on a lot of power adapters—if you move your laptop or monitor’s power brick further away, it may not be as annoying. Some laptop manufacturers may even offer other power adapters without the old school “brick” that may coil whine less. In other cases, there’s nothing you can do, and you’ll have to suffer through the noise.</p><p>If you aren’t convinced the buzzing sound is coil whine, you might also look back at your fans. If they are vibrating against the steel case of your desktop PC, some <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Cosmos-Pieces-Rubber-Mounting-Screws/dp/B00H9905KA\" target=\"_blank\">rubber dampeners</a> may help stop the sound. Your fans may also need lubrication, so a small drop of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00065VGWK\" target=\"_blank\">sewing machine oil</a> in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPyHBH3WwBM\" target=\"_blank\">the bearing of an old fan</a> can make it run like new again. And if you have one of the ever-so-trendy <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Corsair-Radiator-Software-Control-Liquid/dp/B0829RTMKY\" target=\"_blank\">all-in-one liquid cooling units</a> in your gaming PC, make sure it’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbGomv195sk\" target=\"_blank\">mounted properly</a>, and check the manual to see if the pump is adjustable—turning the pump speed down could lessen the buzzing sound it makes.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 30 Aug 2020 13:00:00 +0000","feedId":410,"bgimg":"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/rcudgvp84LHSg-2CfgmDtYZ7YLc=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/I572FOEWQZBMTOGJTD36JR6BAQ.jpg","linkMd5":"95070af2e4b5dadda80a14dc7996fb69","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn39@2020_6/2020/08/31/05-06-35-071_a8fc5edad34625d5.webp","destWidth":2000,"destHeight":1500,"sourceBytes":100037,"destBytes":66352,"author":"Whitson Gordon","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/rcudgvp84LHSg-2CfgmDtYZ7YLc=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/I572FOEWQZBMTOGJTD36JR6BAQ.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn39@2020_6/2020/08/31/05-06-35-071_a8fc5edad34625d5.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598850394631},{"createdTime":"2020-08-31 13:06:34","updatedTime":"2020-08-31 13:06:34","title":"Watch Elon Musk unveil the next version of his AI-powered brain implant, Neuralink","link":"https://www.popsci.com/story/technology/elon-musk-neuralink-brain-ai-chip-announcement/","description":"<p>We first heard about Neuralink back in 2017. Elon Musk had a grand vision of implanting a computer chip in the human brain allowing for direct interface with computers. It’s a grand vision that pictures humans as flesh, blood, bone, and AI hybrids. Amputees could use the interface to control artificial limbs. Non-verbal people could operate communication devices without the need for hands. We could jam our Spotify playlists directly into our grey matter. We’re human hardware. </p><p>Musk showed off a version of it at a demonstration last year, but this week, he has been crowing about how V2 will “blow minds.” He claims that the demo will include a working device that will demonstrate the capabilities of the system in its current state. We’ll be watching it live along with you. The live stream is embedded above, but you can also watch directly on the <a href=\"https://www.neuralink.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Neuralink site.</a></p><p>Computer-brain interfaces aren’t a new concept. I remember getting excited about the concept as a kid when I saw Krang from TMNT piloting his dopey robot body with electrodes attached to his wrinkly pink brain-body. But, the developments haven’t just come from sci-fi. Startups like Kernel and massive tech behemoths such as Facebook are all currently working on the tech in some form or another.</p><p>So far, the technology has shown promise, but it takes a lot to convince someone to let the Geek Squad dig into your skull and start attaching electrodes where there was once only squishy flesh. Musk claims the procedure will be similar to getting Lasik vision surgery, which actually doesn’t sound like too big of an ask, especially if it can delivery on some of its loftier promises, like treating serious brain diseases. Down the road, however, he hopes it will become common place enough that it can become an upgrade process instead of a medical treatment. We’ll excitedly download our new brain firmware to find out what new capacity we have to play with. </p><p>The event</p><p>We’re finally getting started at 6:41 p.m. Eastern. Elon says “recruiting” is the primary purpose of the demo. He says the company isn’t looking for funding, but rather wants to get talented people working on the team.</p><p>He says the primary objective of the device is to fix brain and spine problems.</p><img alt=\"Here's a list of problems Elon claims Neuralink could fix.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" height=\"653\" src=\"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/iekMwhlugHcqJOlnAyEKl6JHbjw=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/U6ZPZSRAAFHEDKOQNDV7O5PUU4.png\" width=\"1162\"/><br/><caption>Here's a list of problems Elon claims Neuralink could fix.

The new device doesn’t require an external piece behind the ear like the version we saw last year.

(NPS/Cascades Carnivore Project/)</caption><p>Wolverines hadn’t been spotted in the forests of Mount Rainier National Park in over 100 years. These animals are so rare, wildlife ecologists struggle even now to determine how vulnerable or endangered they are. So when park wildlife ecologist Tara Chestnut and her colleagues received numerous credible reports of wolverine sightings from hikers, they set out to install a camera in hopes of catching video proof.</p><p>The first camera went up in the fall of 2018. It took a year and a half and five additional camera installations, but the payoff was worth it. When they checked their footage this past spring, the park staff found not only video of a wolverine, but a lactating wolverine (who they have named Joni) with two baby kits. “This is the first reproductive female that we’ve ever documented in the park, and the fact that she was breeding was just a really pleasant surprise,” says Chestnut. “We were just thrilled.”</p><p>With their cameras, Chestnut and her team also spotted a male, who they’ve nicknamed “Van.” But the fact that they found a reproductive wolverine with not one, but two kits, is the biggest happy surprise. Wolverine habitats have become so segmented over the years by cities and highways, she says, but these four wolverines are a sign that different interventions—like the wildlife bridges across the I-90 highway—are an indication that Mount Rainier National Park and its neighbors’ efforts to usher the animals back are not in vain. </p><p>“The last historic report of a wolverine in Mount Rainier National Park is from 1915, it was a trapping record from a park naturalist at the time,” Chestnut says. The soaring prices for wolverine pelts made them popular targets for hunters, she explains, so the wolverine population plummeted throughout the 20th century. Wolverines were hunted so extensively that now there are now only 300 to 1,000 of them in the lower 48 US states, according to Mount Rainier National Park’s <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mora/learn/news/wolverines-return-to-mount-rainier-national-park-after-more-than-100-years.htm\">press release</a>.</p><p>Chestnut says that wolverines are sensitive, shy animals that need a lot of help to recolonize the wilderness they were hunted out of. Seeing the mother and her kits on film is encouraging, but it will be a long journey to usher more animals back to the park. A big part of that effort is documenting where and when wolverines pass through. </p><html><body><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Wolverines Return to Mount Rainier National Park After More Than 100 Years, News Release: <a href=\"https://t.co/qmCkTDsFAU\">https://t.co/qmCkTDsFAU</a><br/><br/>Video of three wolverines at the end of a snowfield then running through a meadow into a forest.

The animals can use their scat not only as a way to communicate with each other about their territories and reproductive status, she says, but scientists can analyze the scat and use it to identify distinct individuals. “That way we can get good estimates of the population.”</p><p>The more data collected, the more we’ll be able to see whether this year’s sightings are part of a long-term recovery or if it’s just a fluke, says Chestnut. Scientists cannot understand wolverine migratory patterns if they don’t see when they move and where they’re going, she says, but since the animals are so elusive, scientists won’t get that information without these super vigilant tracking efforts.</p><p>But these searches, like almost everything, have been waylaid by the pandemic. Female wolverines use snowfall in the winter to build their natal dens, where they birth and take care of their young. The team at Mount Rainier was supposed to look for these snow caves at the end of the spring, after the animals have left but before the snow all melts. Chestnut says that finding and measuring these dens would have provided insight as to how the mothers choose their nesting locations, and helped them protect areas of their park that could serve as dens in the future. Alas, park staff will have to wait until next year to conduct their search.</p><p>Because of their reliance on snowfall for their natal dens, wolverines are a very climate-vulnerable species, says Chestnut, and the warming climate is shrinking their viable habitats. It’s important to preserve the full suite of wildlife, she says, and we’re trying, but it’s too early to celebrate their full comeback.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 28 Aug 2020 12:00:00 +0000","feedId":410,"bgimg":"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/6rVOt8oY5qUbu3N4pA0t8mF0H7Y=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/JPUCDWOGYNAVXHLCCCBQGKBNJU.jpg","linkMd5":"21db6c075bba8ceec9bdb5c98897f17b","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn78@2020_6/2020/08/31/05-06-35-558_ea2b9dd96c874e17.webp","destWidth":1737,"destHeight":1303,"sourceBytes":541418,"destBytes":447276,"author":"Hannah Seo","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/6rVOt8oY5qUbu3N4pA0t8mF0H7Y=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/JPUCDWOGYNAVXHLCCCBQGKBNJU.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn78@2020_6/2020/08/31/05-06-35-558_ea2b9dd96c874e17.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598850394633},{"createdTime":"2020-08-31 13:06:34","updatedTime":"2020-08-31 13:06:34","title":"California and the Forest Service have a plan to prevent future catastrophic fires","link":"https://www.popsci.com/story/environment/california-wildfire-management-agreement/","description":"<img alt=\"A road during the Jones Fire\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" height=\"3746\" src=\"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/LJWYIB_dLZdQtGdX2WagN-ojpKg=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/7UKSVDQQTJE5PP5UPVPGDA2YLY.jpg\" width=\"4848\"/><br/><caption>A road during the Jones Fire (Marcus Kauffman/)</caption><p>As hundreds of fires scorch California, state officials and federal forest agents <a href=\"https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8.12.20-CA-Shared-Stewardship-MOU.pdf\">signed an agreement</a> that may help the state be able to better weather future fire seasons.</p><p>Right now, <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-08-23/massive-california-firestorms-expected-to-worsen-with-more-lightning-winds\">the second and third largest fires</a> in the state’s history are ripping through coastal forests and inland shrubland in Northern California. The flames have claimed more than 1,100 homes and other buildings, along with <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/25/us/california-fires.html\">1.4 million acres of land</a>. </p><p>Climate change is culpable here. While fire is a normal and necessary part of much of California’s forest and rangelands, the region’s trend toward <a href=\"https://www.popsci.com/california-wet-dry-season/\">heightened wet and dry extremes</a>, coupled with overall warmer conditions, make the state especially primed for high-intensity burns. </p><p>But the way forests have been managed for the past 100 years hasn’t helped the situation. Prior to the Gold Rush, fires were a part of the landscape—ignited by both lightning strikes and Native Americans. Around four million acres burned every year on average, and smoky skies in summer and fall were <a href=\"https://nature.berkeley.edu/stephenslab/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Stephens-et-al.-CA-fire-area-FEM-2007.pdf\">probably not unusual</a>. After settlers forcibly removed Indigenous people from the land, their cultural burning practices were eventually <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/08/24/899422710/to-manage-wildfire-california-looks-to-what-tribes-have-known-all-along\">replaced by policies of full-on fire suppression</a>. Between the 1930s and 1970s, the U.S. Forest Service and state officials maintained a mindset of dousing all blazes.</p><p>But periodic, generally lower-intensity fires are important for distributing nutrients, helping seeds germinate, and managing disease. They also prevent the build-up of small trees, shrubs and woody material, which otherwise cause the fires that do spark to become especially large and intense. In response, management has been changing in recent decades, albeit at a slow pace. The <a href=\"https://www.popsci.com/story/science/not-enough-prescribed-burns-californiia/\">perceived risks about the process and high costs</a> have blocked an aggressive statewide policy to reintroduce fire and reduce fuels.</p><p>Now, as smoke chokes much of the northern and central part of the state, officials in Sacramento have signed an agreement that appears to do just that. In the agreement, Forest Service agents, the California Natural Resources Agency Secretary, and Governor Gavin Newsom committed to “shared stewardship” of the state’s forests and rangelands. Most strikingly, the non-binding memo names a goal of thinning, burning, or otherwise treating vegetation across one million acres annually by 2025 (with federal and state agencies each contributing 500,000 acres).  For comparison, prescribed burns in California totalled <a href=\"https://www.nifc.gov/fireInfo/fireInfo_statistics.html\">less than 50,000 acres in 2017</a> (though that stat doesn’t include those wildfires that were allowed to burn or tree thinning).</p><p>“This kind of commitment is a really great step,” says Rebecca Miller, an environmental scientist at Stanford University studying wildfire policies. “Restoring healthy forests and rangelands is a great move forward.” In <a href=\"https://resources.ca.gov/CNRALegacyFiles/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/California-Forest-Carbon-Plan-Final-Draft-for-Public-Release-May-2018.pdf\">a 2018 forest carbon plan</a>, state officials included a goal to treat 60,000 acres a year on non-federal lands, and noted that 500,000 acres was an “aspirational goal.” So the new agreement seems to be an effort to turn that aspiration into action, and commit the Forest Service to matching the effort. Across California, <a href=\"https://www.popsci.com/story/science/not-enough-prescribed-burns-californiia/\">approximately 20 million acres</a> are thought to be in need of some kind of treatment, such as managed fires or thinning.</p><p>The agreement also addressed a key barrier to broad-scale action: coordination between different land managers. California forests and shrublands encompass a patchwork of private, state, and federal management. Sometimes that quilt of management strategies is visible from the sky. “Sometimes, if you have an aerial image, there’s a line you can see when it goes from Forest Service to private land, or from Forest Service to national park, just because whatever has been done on that land is so different,” says Emily Moran, a plant ecologist at the University of California, Merced. She says that at one research site of hers, the trees are visibly a different color between private and federal groves when viewed from above. “Fire and other factors don’t respect those boundaries,” adds Moran. “I think it’s encouraging to try and get people to talk to each other more.”</p><p>The agreement emphasizes the need for agencies to collaborate on restoration, since fire is indifferent to jurisdictional boundaries. This could include setting shared goals, consolidating data, and working together to monitor ecosystems and support long-term research projects. For private landowners, the agencies proposed streamlining permitting processes and providing technical assistance to make it less expensive and easier to thin stands. This could be crucial: Miller points out that 39 percent of forests in the state are privately-owned. If an agency, for example, wanted to reduce woody fuels around the perimeter of a town vulnerable to fires, one uncooperative landowner can spoil the effort. “If you get a little bit of resistance, it can complicate efforts to conduct your burn,” says Miller. </p><p>Of course, this all comes with a price tag. The agreement notes a few ways to recoup funds. One is to “improve” timber harvest—the statement is vaguely worded but appears to suggest increased logging. “California has some of the highest environmental standards for timber harvest in the world, producing California lumber could decrease demand for timber harvested with lower ecological standards,” the agreement reads. “Given California’s increasing housing needs and greenhouse gas emission goals, California has a direct interest in consuming ecologically sourced lumber.”</p><p>That provision may give environmental groups reason to worry. “The question is how you do [tree thinning] in a way that’s responsible and driven by science and not driven by the political demands of the logging industry,” Kathryn Phillips, executive director of Sierra Club California, <a href=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/08/23/california-fires-state-feds-agree-to-thin-millions-of-acres-of-forests/\">told the <i>The Mercury News</i></a>. </p><p>A more creative funding idea floated in the agreement is to somehow monetize the small trees, twigs, and other bits scraped up into piles during thinning treatments. Right now, those piles present a fire risk and are costly to manage. But there might be other options, such as a market for chopping debris into plywood material or burning them for biofuel. “That could provide funding that’s needed in order to treat all the areas,” says Moran. “But you would also have to be very careful you don’t create any sort of perverse incentives to overharvest.”</p><p>The agreement also provides for continued research throughout these efforts. Moran says that it will be important to continue analyzing how different treatments affect factors like fire behavior and biodiversity. Generally, managed or prescribed flames tend to mimic natural conditions better than thinning treatments, but sometimes fire might be impractical or unpopular (for example, due to concerns about air quality). </p><p>Even with the warmer and drier conditions we’re baking into the region, Moran says that management can make a big difference for ecology as well as safety. “If fuel is more spread out and patchy, it is still going to be harder for fires to get up to the really huge sizes we’ve been seeing some recent cases,” she says. “So my instinct is—and what the research seems to be suggesting at this point—is that management is still going to be helpful, but we are still going to be seeing effects [of climate change].”</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 27 Aug 2020 10:00:00 +0000","feedId":410,"bgimg":"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/LJWYIB_dLZdQtGdX2WagN-ojpKg=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/7UKSVDQQTJE5PP5UPVPGDA2YLY.jpg","linkMd5":"3515e33644221a5c0af0ef0731ff9f1b","destWidth":4848,"destHeight":3746,"sourceBytes":2291560,"destBytes":2305492,"author":"Ula Chrobak","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/LJWYIB_dLZdQtGdX2WagN-ojpKg=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/7UKSVDQQTJE5PP5UPVPGDA2YLY.jpg":null},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598850394627},{"createdTime":"2020-08-31 13:06:34","updatedTime":"2020-08-31 13:06:34","title":"10 classic motorcycles to drool over","link":"https://www.popsci.com/story/cars/classic-honda-motorcycles-photos/","description":"<img alt=\"Honda CBX engine.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/3s8Ljf5FNfwVRkbBFkD-izi6J0c=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/C7ZXMYOFIVFY5IJOX2MW6EI4M4.jpg\" width=\"1500\"/><br/><caption>Honda CBX engine.

For decades, the Super Cub had been a workhouse in developing nations, where its utility and affordability made it ubiquitous—far removed from the spirit of leisure that it inspired in American riders in the 1960s. These days, its practicality is just as appealing to American riders looking for basic, easy transportation as is its reputation for “niceness.” You may meet the nicest people on a Honda, but you’ll also meet practical people on a Honda.

The Japanese industrial machine outdone by a bunch of chain-smoking, long lunch-taking, summer holiday-going Italians? This was not to be borne.

Over time, the division has become even more pronounced (see: the MotoGP-derived $184,000 RC213V-S and the staid VFR1200X “adventure” bike).</p><p>By splicing the Interceptor family tree into two branches—the unattainable and the “plebeian”—and by focusing its sporting endeavors on its inline-four-powered CBRs, Honda denied consumers one of their greatest dreams: a mass-produced V-4 race-replica sportbike.</p><p>But I’m getting ahead of myself. Back to the VFR750F. In the ’90s, the VFR was one heck of a motorcycle: “plebeian” only in its price and availability. From ’90–‘97, the VFR showed up on<i> </i><a href=\"https://www.cycleworld.com/ten-best-motorcycles/\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Cycle World</i>’s Ten Best</a> list every single year. It’s not too much of a stretch to claim it’s one of the most universally acclaimed Hondas of all time thanks to its near-race-rep levels of performance and all-around usability. Honda’s reputation for refinement is no more exemplified than on the VFR, its liquid-smooth powerband a testament to the simple beauty of a cable-actuated throttle and a perfectly tuned carburetor.</p><p>Be that as it may, we can’t help but wonder, “What if the Interceptor had continued as Big Red’s sportbike platform?” And, can we please have a modern version of the RC36-2?</p><p>1993 Honda CBR900RR</p><img alt=\"The best part of the 1990s: the sportbikes.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/T_Eemi7s035X99Zgtwnip1CNEnU=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/G4OPBLKKONFQBPHZKEV76ZLFOI.jpg\" width=\"1500\"/><br/><caption>The best part of the 1990s: the sportbikes.

At the time, liter-class motorcycles were more GT bikes than track weapons—think Kawasaki ZX-11. So when the CBR came out in 1993, weighing 144 pounds less than the ZX-11 (yes, you read that correctly), we should have known everything was about to change.</p><p>Since then, the CBR has been a mainstay in Honda’s lineup even while other bikes, like the RC51, made racetrack headlines. Tadao Baba’s original Blade is still one of the most iconic sportbikes of all time.</p><p>1990 Honda Hawk GT NT650</p><img alt=\"In Japan, the NT650 carried the model name “Bros,” not Hawk GT.

It’d be the talk of the show. You’d want it. We’d all want it.</p><p>The thing is, Honda built this very thing from 1988–1990. The NT650, or Hawk GT, wasn’t a hot seller. But now it’s a cult classic. It’s greyhound-like litheness makes the SV650 look like a barrel-shaped labrador retriever.</p><p>The Hawk GT is kind of a greatest-hits album of motorcycling must-haves. It’s undeniably cool yet has a utilitarian vibe, it’s light and sporty, it’s practically bulletproof. There’s just something about it. Something universal. The Hawk is so appealing and affordable that some people own several at once.</p><p>1989 Honda GB500</p><img alt=\"Honda’s answer to the “classic 500cc British single,” the GB500 Tourist Trophy.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" height=\"393\" src=\"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/2loDt-9PMuDSrysBVwd9DjqiTfc=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/5YI4RI2RMZA7TJ7GUNBHZWAGHE.jpg\" width=\"590\"/><br/><caption>Honda’s answer to the “classic 500cc British single,” the GB500 Tourist Trophy. (Honda/)</caption><p>Honda’s interpretation of the classic 500cc British single, the GB500 Tourist Trophy is another cult classic. Built from 1989–1990, the GB never sold well. First, it was a single, and Americans haven’t been too keen on singles since, well, somebody put two cylinders in a frame. Secondly, 30 years ago, classic café racer styling wasn’t as en vogue as it is today. So what we have here is an ahead-of-its time motorcycle based on an old-fashioned-style motorcycle that was never immensely popular with Americans in the first place. In other words, a marketer’s nightmare.</p><p>Anyway, the GB500′s air-cooled mill was derived from the 1983 XR500 dirt bike, and sported a single 42mm round-slide Keihin carburetor. It also had preload-adjustable Showa suspension, electric-start and a kickstarter, and a single disc brake up front. And it weighed less than 400 pounds fully fueled. What’s not to like, America?</p><p>It may not be a real-deal Velocette or BSA, but it is a classic in its own right. Then again, Honda didn’t build the GB thinking it ever would be, you’d imagine. It’s classic for the very fact that it _isn’t_ an old British single, but a motorcycle built in Japan in the ’80s by people who romanticized a glorious era before their own. In other words, it was an idea that didn’t catch on until decades later. Classic Honda.</p><p>1983 Honda VF750F Interceptor</p><img alt=\"Along with the first-gen Suzuki GSX-R750, the Honda Interceptor, in many ways, is the first iteration of the modern sportbike.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/u7ZzRahwr-5E-pS3LxMYHKDAP3A=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/JIRMRFQ6I5GPLLVRV6IN2K6VJE.jpg\" width=\"1500\"/><br/><caption>Along with the first-gen Suzuki GSX-R750, the Honda Interceptor, in many ways, is the first iteration of the modern sportbike. (Honda/)</caption><p>Honda has long been synonymous with four-stroke V-4s, thanks in large part to the groundbreaking 1983 Honda Interceptor, one of the first production motorcycles, along with the 1985 Suzuki GSX-R750, to create the sportbike category as we know it. Americans, common thinking of the time went, only cared about straight-line performance. The Interceptor either proved otherwise, or gave us a reason to fall in love with corners. It wasn’t long before consumers went sportbike mad—ironic, considering Honda’s primary objective for the Interceptor was racetrack success.</p><p>For the 1983 season, the AMA decreased the displacement limit in the superbike class from 1,000cc to 750cc with the hope of remedying the sphincter-testing handling qualities of the era’s brute-ish superbikes. While the Interceptor won six straight races in ’83, Wayne Rainey won the championship aboard a Muzzy Kawasaki GPz750. Then Honda went on to win the next five championships.</p><p>1979 Honda CBX1000</p><img alt=\"Look at all those header pipes!\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/-qVVruYFHL61bSGtgvCx_CFPOyk=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/FM7VUGBYI5H53OQYIOLNA2XEEY.jpg\" width=\"1500\"/><br/><caption>Look at all those header pipes! (Honda/)</caption><p>The 1979 <a href=\"https://www.motorcyclistonline.com/1970s-motorcycles-hondas-six-cylinder-cbx/\" target=\"_blank\">CBX seems to represent broader cultural tastes</a> than it does the motorcycling world’s own development trends. Consider: the Interceptor’s debut was only four years away, and the “light means right” mantra not far behind it. The CBX wasn’t a sportbike per se. It wasn’t a Gold Wing either. It was just…cool. The way its 1,047cc engine dangles beneath the frame sans downtubes, giving an uninterrupted view of its six glorious chromed header pipes accentuates its six-iness. The CBX is a double-take bike because it almost looks wrong. So, so wrong.</p><p>The CBX was designed by Soichiro Irimajiri, who was responsible for the now-legendary six-cylinder RC165 and RC166 grand prix racers. You can almost hear the Honda marketing men saying, “And if a little magic happens to rub off from Hailwood’s machines, then so be it.” And that association is just about where the CBX’s racing credentials end. While Honda notoriously added cylinders to its racebikes in the ’60s in search of more revs and more horsepower, the CBX revved to a conservative 9,000 rpm and produced 105 hp. Wet weight was a burly 600 pounds.</p><p>The CBX persists in giving the impression that Honda built it just because it could. It didn’t impact the motorcycling world like the Gold Wing or Interceptor did, but here we are still talking about it. And mentioning the RC166 in the same breath.</p><p>1969 Honda CB750</p><img alt=\"The motorcycle that changed the course of the sport forever.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/g_n69-91IF6uCyaYmuPPa2UzCRg=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/TXMPIF4FRVGNNDN6PAZNRE3P2U.jpg\" width=\"1500\"/><br/><caption>The motorcycle that changed the course of the sport forever.

It would give you a far better perspective of the world—or at least help you be a smarter pet parent. We’re here to demystify your animals (to some extent), while also shedding advice on how you can best thrive together. Welcome to Pet Psychic.</i></p><p>Take a quick flash picture of your dog or cat and their eyes will light up in a way that’s equal parts cool and unnerving. That eerie glow comes from a layer of their eyes called a tapetum and it reflects light to let our furry pals see small amounts of light much more efficiently than our human eyes. In fact, our pets sense the world we live in much differently than people do.</p><p>As children, many of us learned that cats and dogs are “colorblind” or see the world in “black and white”—but <a href=\"https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/health/are-dogs-color-blind/\" target=\"_blank\">that’s not entirely true</a>. “They [just] can’t see all the different colors that we can see,” says Katherine Houpt, a professor at Cornell’s College of Veterinary Medicine . “From what we can tell, they see the world in shades of blue and yellow.”</p><img alt=\"This demonstration is purely for color purposes. The yellow and blue tones come through, but reds don't. In reality, the dog and cat vision would also be a lot blurrier.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" height=\"1531\" src=\"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/d7OG0DI-uOydh6JjP4GEL64L-tI=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/RIP2OWJJORGJFAILTUC23OE6KA.jpg\" width=\"2041\"/><br/><caption>This demonstration is purely for color purposes. The yellow and blue tones come through, but reds don't. In reality, the dog and cat vision would also be a lot blurrier. (Stan Horaczek /)</caption><p>From a physiology standpoint, the unique view comes down to types of light receptors in the eye itself. “Because dogs and cats are predators, they don’t have to be able to tell the difference between some similar shades,” Houpt explains. “As primates, we have to know whether that persimmon is ripe or not. We’re better at color discrimination in order to find the correct foods.” In other words, a grey rabbit is just as tasty as a brown one.</p><p>When it comes to clarity, humans also have an advantage over our domesticated pals. If a dog can make out an object from 20 feet away, a human can see it from 60 feet. The difference is even more pronounced for cats—what a cat can see from 20 feet, a human can see from 100 or even 200 feet out. Our pets aren’t built to process crystal clear images of the world around them.</p><p>The animals do have an advantage, however, when it comes to perceiving movement—a skill honed to help them catch their fast-moving food. While most cats and dogs have trouble spotting still objects very close to them, they can spot movement for up to a half-mile—even if it’s relatively subtle.</p><p>They can also see more at once than humans. While our field of view is approximately 180 degrees, feline and canine eyes bulge out a little to expand their peripheral vision <a href=\"https://www.sagecenters.com/veterinaryvision/resources/what-do-dogs-and-cats-see/#:~:text=Dogs+have+eyes+which+are,half+that+possessed+by+humans.\" target=\"_blank\">past 200 degrees</a>. That same motion detection extends to the edges of their vision, so even if they can’t tell what’s moving, they know something’s coming.</p><p>That field of view can differ  depending on the breed of dog, though. A bulldog, for instance, doesn’t have to see around a giant snout like some other breeds, which comes in handy when observing objects up close and gives them a bigger overall field of unobstructed view.</p><p>One commonly held conception that’s true: When it comes to seeing in the dark, cat and dog eyes excel, in part because the tapetum reflects illumination to the light receptors. “They can’t see in absolute darkness any better than we can,” says Houpt. “But in dim light, they can see better.” That’s because their eyes contain more rods than ours—between six and eight times more for cats—which means they require less illumination to collect a usable picture for their brain.</p><p>But their uncanny perception doesn’t end there. Once you’ve considered all of the advantages and shortcomings of cat and dog vision, you still have to consider how it interplays with their other senses.</p><p>Cats can hear <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=cats+hear+ultrasonic+sound&#38;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS876US876&#38;oq=cats+hear+ultrasonic+sound&#38;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l2.3742j0j7&#38;sourceid=chrome&#38;ie=UTF-8\" target=\"_blank\">ultrasonic pitches</a> typically emitted by their prey, which allows them to continue the chase, even if their scurrying snack gets out of eye shot. They also use smell as a primary method to identify people. “When you take a cat to the vet, your second cat may not recognize it because it smells like other people. And if you’ve been gone for a while and come back, the cat may not recognize you until it takes a good whiff,” Houpt says. “If you changed shampoos while you were gone, you might be in for a problem.”</p><p>Dogs obviously have a keen sense of smell as well. Like cats and other animals, they have a <a href=\"https://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/how-dogs-use-smell-to-perceive-the-world#:~:text=Unlike+humans,+dogs+have+an,mouth+behind+the+upper+incisors.\" target=\"_blank\">vomeronasal organ</a> as part of the olfactory system specifically dedicated to their olfactory needs. It allows wilder things to communicate via scentand improves the overall sense of smell. Depending on the breed, a dog’s sense of smell ranges from 1,000 and 10,000 times more effective than a human’s.</p><p>With those extra tools at their disposal, dogs and cats don’t need to depend on their eyes to navigate the world. Their visual limitations, however, can provide some interesting problems for humans trying to teach animals new tricks. “Because of how they see color, dogs are not very good at traffic lights,” Houpt says. “That becomes a problem when you’re teaching a guide dog so they have to learn that the darker yellow is when they have to stop.” In an ideal world, traffic lights would have an olfactory component so helpful pooches could smell when it’s time to go.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 28 Aug 2020 21:03:15 +0000","feedId":410,"bgimg":"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/dbCIPEe3vHrKsi2E4tMwSexVgfo=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/VPJZX6TT4JFCRCD66X2XXBRJ3Q.jpg","linkMd5":"3f0fee02809dd81041b8a97c94820ad3","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn86@2020_1/2020/08/31/05-06-35-052_f436a66adfb9f588.webp","destWidth":1320,"destHeight":880,"sourceBytes":162409,"destBytes":135758,"author":"Stan Horaczek","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/dbCIPEe3vHrKsi2E4tMwSexVgfo=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/VPJZX6TT4JFCRCD66X2XXBRJ3Q.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn86@2020_1/2020/08/31/05-06-35-052_f436a66adfb9f588.webp","https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/COUYOTHJ5JGLXJJFJA7ZS7ZQ4Y.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn31@2020_2/2020/08/31/05-07-03-396_dd3a5be32b6985b7.webp","https://www.popsci.com/resizer/d7OG0DI-uOydh6JjP4GEL64L-tI=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/RIP2OWJJORGJFAILTUC23OE6KA.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn44@2020_2/2020/08/31/05-07-02-199_db892716de621152.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598850394624},{"createdTime":"2020-08-31 13:06:34","updatedTime":"2020-08-31 13:06:34","title":"Water flossers that get between your teeth","link":"https://www.popsci.com/story/shop/water-flossers/","description":"<img alt=\"Add to your nightly routine.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" height=\"625\" src=\"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/5l0gwoRxKLMksNKsGYSiSZbuv88=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/QU3Q47TAABASBEOR2ILLNLWJI4.jpg\" width=\"938\"/><br/><caption>Add to your nightly routine.

It comes with seven tips, including three regular ones, a toothbrush tip, a plaque-seeking tip, one tip for people with braces, and one for those with gum disease. The irrigator rotates a full 360 degrees to reach all your teeth, and a helpful timer beeps every 30 seconds as a reminder to shift to a different part of your mouth. The settings are controlled by a dial on the main unit, and on/off switches are located on the flosser’s handle and on the Aquarius’s base.

It would give you a far better perspective of the world—or at least help you be a smarter pet parent. We’re here to demystify your animals (to some extent), while also shedding advice on how you can best thrive together. Welcome to Pet Psychic.</i></p><p>Walking your dog seems simple enough—it’s just you, your pup, and the great outdoors. But without the right equipment and approach, a much-anticipated W-A-L-K can be disappointing.</p><p>Get some good gear</p><p>Search for “walking a dog” online and you’ll find pages of photos with people holding leashes attached to a collar around a dog’s throat, which is exactly what the experts we spoke to advise against.</p><p>“I’m not a big fan of anything around the neck that’s pulling,” says Anna Mynchenberg, a manager at <a href=\"https://bark.co/\" target=\"_blank\">Bark</a>, the company behind BarkBox. “I can’t imagine having any pressure on my neck, so I wouldn’t want to do that to my dog.”</p><p>There are simply too many reasons your furry best friend might pull on the leash, pressing the collar against their windpipe, says Kate Perry, <a href=\"https://kateperrydogtraining.com/\" target=\"_blank\">a dog trainer</a> based in New York City. That could choke them or, in a worst-case scenario where they leap off a bridge, leave them dangling by their neck.</p><p>A comfortable harness</p><p>You can avoid potentially strangling your dog by buying a harness. There are many to choose from, including models that can help <a href=\"https://www.rover.com/blog/no-pull-dog-harnesses-that-work-your-complete-guide-to-the-best-options/\" target=\"_blank\">keep an eager canine from pulling</a> on the leash. Mynchenberg, who has a master’s degree in human-canine life sciences from <a href=\"https://www.berginu.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Bergin University of Canine Studies</a>, says she likes <a href=\"https://amzn.to/32kQlu6\">harnesses with handles</a> because they offer an easy way to grab and hold your pet.</p><p>Going a little deeper, if your dog is stronger than you, or if you’re training a puppy, consider <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3ljKNJa\" target=\"_blank\">a front-clip</a> or <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2FYyiT3\" target=\"_blank\">no-pull harness</a>. Leashes that attach at the back of a dog’s shoulders only reinforce pulling, Perry says. But fasten one to the front, and it’ll block much of your pup’s power and keep them from yanking, she explains.</p><p>Before you strap on a harness, though, Perry recommends taking a few days to familiarize your dog with the equipment, as they may not be comfortable with it at first. That means creating positive associations by putting it on and taking it off multiple times in a row while giving them treats, and buckling them in during meals and playtime.</p><p>A leash that lets you maintain control</p><p>For most, if not all, of the time you’re walking your dog, your hand will be holding a leash—so get something comfortable. “You want something you can really grip,” Perry says. For a medium-size dog, she suggests a ½- to ¾-inch-wide nylon leash. Try <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2QlXiFM\" target=\"_blank\">rope-style leashes</a> for another option.</p><p>Perry’s ideal leash is 6 feet long with three sets of knots along the length to use as grips if your dog pulls away from you (also the perfect length to help you keep proper social distance from anyone you walk by). If you don’t want to knot up your lead, you can buy a <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2CZURFH\" target=\"_blank\">leash</a> that has two or <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2QlXHIi\" target=\"_blank\">three loops</a> sewn in.</p><p>A <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3j93ygi\" target=\"_blank\">waist leash</a> is another option. Mynchenberg says she likes these because they allow her to keep her hands free to work on training or simply enjoy time with her dog. Perry, however, isn’t a fan of these, as your dog could pull and injure you. Ultimately, it comes down to how well you know your dog and how well you’ve trained them, she says.</p><p>Another note: Don’t get a retractable leash unless you’re going to spend a lot of time roaming parks, beaches, or hiking trails, where you can let your dog run relatively free. On city streets, they can be more trouble than they’re worth. For one, you don’t really have control when you let the leash spool out, and while you’re supposed to be able to reel it back in, they sometimes malfunction. Perry has also seen unsuspecting pedestrians walk into leashes linking dogs and owners that are far apart.</p><p>Other useful options</p><p>A harness and leash are the bare minimum you need to walk a dog, but you should bring <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3jefBcg\" target=\"_blank\">a bunch of bags</a> along to pick up your pup’s poop, too. Don’t forget treats, either, especially if your dog is highly motivated by snacks, like Mynchenberg’s two boxers, Hercules and Denver. “If they want that squirrel, you have to have something better,” she says.</p><p>And if you like to accessorize, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-the-covid-era-purses-are-out-fanny-packs-are-in-11597831215\" target=\"_blank\">consider a fanny pack</a>. They can hold treats, your phone, your keys, and whatever else you normally would’ve shoved into your pockets or carried in your hands, Mynchenberg says.</p><p>Plan when to walk your dog</p><img alt=\"A misty morning walk will keep your dog cool.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" height=\"1338\" src=\"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/bpvXSz00wgLErEVN7g-xjNUiOlg=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/N2WHZ6LWBRDXHMVNGKBYRHME2Q.jpg\" width=\"2000\"/><br/><caption>A misty morning walk will keep your dog cool. (Tadeusz Lakota/Unsplash/)</caption><p>Depending on your dog and the reason for walking, you should hit the street one to four times a day. That could include one long exercise trek, two shorter workouts, and/or bathroom time. Mynchenberg suggests heading out in the morning or evening to avoid midday heat and traveling less-crowded paths to avoid overstimulating your pup. These numbers may vary depending on your pet’s age and energy level, as well as whether you have a fenced-in yard.</p><p>Keep things consistent</p><p>As soon as the leash is on, decide which side you will keep the dog on for the duration of the walk. “If I’m walking with a child, I won’t let them zig-zag around, but will hold them in my left or right hand,” Perry explains. “You’re loving your dog by giving it some order.” Stop to reposition them if they wander astray while you’re moving. It’s also important that if multiple people are taking the dog out, they all maintain the same basic procedures, Perry says.</p><p>Think about the route</p><p>In short, don’t walk your dog on hot surfaces. If you can’t touch the ground with your bare hand or step on it with bare feet, it’ll hurt your pet, Perry and Mynchenberg both say.</p><p>Beyond that, though, the preferred path depends on the dog. Among Mynchenberg’s companions, Denver will walk on anything because he’s had a lot of experience getting to know different environments. Hercules, on the other hand, took a long time to walk over bridges. If something is new, dogs sometimes respond with fear or hesitation—so if they’re not a fan of what’s around them, you’ll know, she says.</p><p>Pick up your dog’s poop</p><p>That’s it. That’s the tip. Don’t let it decompose in nature or “fertilize” someone’s yard. Send it straight to the landfill.</p><p>Keep your dog’s pee away from people</p><p>Generally, try to find a grassy area or curb for your dog to urinate on and stick to it. Ideally, you’ll want to train your dog to pee in one or a few spots and keep them away from hosing down anything people might touch or pick up, including trash cans, Mynchenberg says.</p><p>Learn to handle distractions</p><p>If your <a href=\"https://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/dog-training-strong-prey-drive\" target=\"_blank\">dog has a high prey drive</a>, anything that moves quickly will spark excitement, Mynchenberg says. Having the right equipment is one part of the solution, but training is the other. For example, Mychenberg’s dog Hercules will react to people and other canines, so they taught him to heel to her right side. He knows this means treats, pets, and praise, so he responds to the command well, she says.</p><p>You should also train your dog to look back at you every time they see a squirrel or something interesting, to essentially ask permission to investigate. Whenever your pooch does so, you’ll want to reward it, Mynchenberg says. She explains that every time Hercules sees a person, he checks in with her.</p><p>If your dog isn’t well-trained yet, it’s important that you understand their triggers and how much they can handle stimulus-wise. Know what to look for and keep an eye on your surroundings so you can manage any potential problems before the situation escalates, Perry says. Cities like the one she lives in are full of distractions, so she likes to stand between two parked cars and do command training to get the dog she’s with to focus on her and ignore whatever’s whizzing by.</p><p>Don’t always follow the same route</p><p>Once you’ve established a solid walking regimen, it’s good to keep things interesting. “Dogs will find something to sniff even if the path is familiar, but it adds that extra layer of excitement if you go somewhere new,” Mynchenberg says. If you’re still training your dog, however, stick to a route your pup is used to, which limits distractions.</p><p>Understand the risks of exercising with your dog</p><p>You may be a marathoner or an expert cyclist, but your dog may not be (we’ll bet they can’t even ride a bike). “Just like humans have to work up to running or exercising, dogs do, too,” Mynchenberg says. “You’re not going to be setting any personal records on your dog’s first run.”</p><p>If you do exercise with your dog, pay attention to them and make sure you meet their needs first. That means running when it’s cool out, bringing a bottle of water to keep them hydrated, and taking frequent breaks. After all, <a href=\"https://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/taking-your-pets-temperature\" target=\"_blank\">a dog’s normal body temperature</a> is a few degrees higher than a human’s, and they’ve got a full suit of hair. “Imagine having a fever, with a coat on, and running,” Perry says.</p><p>Riding a bike with a dog is more complicated because wheels move faster than legs (even four of them). Any ride you take will have to be fairly leisurely. There’s also the risk that your dog pulls the bike off balance. But before you even get on a bike, you’ll want to make sure your dog is used to being near them. A good way to familiarize them with the machine, Mychenberg says, is to walk them next to it. To avoid having to hold anything while riding, you can get <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3aXOPlJ\" target=\"_blank\">a bike seat attachment</a> that connects to your dog’s leash.</p><p>Be careful when going off-leash</p><p>Before you set your dog free, make sure you know the leash laws in your area. Many places require dogs to remain linked to their humans at all times. You’ll also want to have rock-solid commands that will make them come to your side immediately, stop what they’re doing, and drop animals and objects they’ve picked up, Perry says.</p><p>Both Perry and Mynchenberg stress that enclosed areas, like a dog park or fenced-in yard, are most ideal for off-leash sessions. That goes for well-trained dogs, too, because once you take the leash off, a lot of factors will be beyond your control. Even wide open areas like beaches and parks are risky because your dog may encounter an unexpected trigger or unseen danger, says Perry, who has also authored the book <i>Training For Both Ends of the Leash</i>. In such situations, it’s crucial to have a deep understanding of your pet and a learned list of commands.</p><p>Cool down after the walk</p><p>Once you get back home, you can flop down and relax or try to squeeze a little more productivity out of your pooch. When a dog is calm and tired post-walk, Mynchenberg likes to take advantage of that time to work on essentials that are tough when a dog is amped up, like crate training.</p><p>Not every walk is going to be perfect, but if you have a plan and know what you and your dog want to get out of it before you go, each one will be better than the last.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 26 Aug 2020 19:01:27 +0000","feedId":410,"bgimg":"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/mdtsAqUOKVHkUaMmVp8usHn5nEA=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/GVGGK5MCDBEP3PS22LJMHY7HV4.jpg","linkMd5":"274e1adb0b83e97aba6218efbd0b8436","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn90@2020_5/2020/08/31/05-06-55-563_47b7b36c7a78c916.webp","destWidth":2000,"destHeight":1500,"sourceBytes":623055,"destBytes":478534,"author":"John Kennedy","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/mdtsAqUOKVHkUaMmVp8usHn5nEA=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/GVGGK5MCDBEP3PS22LJMHY7HV4.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn90@2020_5/2020/08/31/05-06-55-563_47b7b36c7a78c916.webp","https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/COUYOTHJ5JGLXJJFJA7ZS7ZQ4Y.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn31@2020_2/2020/08/31/05-07-03-396_dd3a5be32b6985b7.webp","https://www.popsci.com/resizer/bpvXSz00wgLErEVN7g-xjNUiOlg=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/N2WHZ6LWBRDXHMVNGKBYRHME2Q.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn66@2020_3/2020/08/31/05-07-03-101_f6fe80d002e34b75.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598850394632},{"createdTime":"2020-08-31 13:06:34","updatedTime":"2020-08-31 13:06:34","title":"Five cool ways to upcycle old coffee sacks","link":"https://www.popsci.com/story/diy/coffee-sack-diy-projects/","description":"<img alt=\"You see burlap, we see couture.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/1gq0REKo--YCDSHsBFvYmxFKjWQ=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/ZR4N4MOQA5CBHISTWXH55CDLHA.jpg\" width=\"2000\"/><br/><caption>You see burlap, we see couture. ( Thomas Thompson / Unsplash/)</caption><p>Fresh coffee goes stale too fast to travel far. The beans in that daily espresso you get from your local shop were probably roasted just a few miles down the road—or even in the shop itself.</p><p>Your local independent roaster is probably buying big bags of raw coffee from Asia, South America, or Africa, and the burlap bags it comes in—<a href=\"http://www.ico.org/\" target=\"_blank\">produced by the millions each year</a>—are mostly a waste product. Unless someone does something with them.</p><p>Where to find coffee sacks</p><p>The simplest way is to ask at a local café that roasts their own beans. Each sack makes around 700 standard cups of coffee, if you were wondering—so even micro-roasters go through a couple of them a week.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.portlandcoffeeroasters.com/about/sustainability/\" target=\"_blank\">Some roasters</a> will happily give you a few sacks for free, especially if you’re a customer. Other slightly more enterprising cafés will charge a couple of bucks for each one or<a href=\"https://www.deargreencoffee.com/products/used-coffee-sacks\" target=\"_blank\"> ask for a donation to charity</a>. As a ballpark, the standard price sits somewhere around $1 and $2 per sack—I paid less than $10 to have four of them shipped to my door, so if you’re spending more than that you’ll probably want to check other shops for a better deal.</p><p>If you’re visiting your roaster in person, you’ll likely be able to pick out whatever sacks you want, but if you buy them online, you’ll probably just get a random assortment. If you need to calculate a specific amount of raw material for a project, don’t worry—<a href=\"http://coffeetime.wikidot.com/standard-coffee-sack-weights-green-coffee\" target=\"_blank\">the size is pretty standard</a> (about 38 by 26 inches) so the biggest difference will be the designs printed on the front.</p><p>How to clean a jute sack</p><p>By the time you get them, your coffee sacks will have travelled halfway around the world, if not further, so don’t be surprised if they are hard-used, wrinkled, and a bit dirty. Depending on what you want to do with them, you’ll likely want to give them a wash first.</p><p>The loose hessian weave of most coffee sacks won’t survive the washer and dryer, so the best thing to do is hand-wash them in soapy water and leave them to hang dry.</p><p>To eliminate any wrinkles, grab an iron and work out any creases on the highest setting—it’s not a light fabric so it can take a few passes.</p><p>What to do with coffee sacks</p><img alt=\"You can use a coffee sack to make a tote bag or a planter.

But they don’t just have to be raw material.</p><p>Turn them into grow sacks</p><p>Burlap is seriously useful in the garden. The hardy material can stand up to the weather while still letting your plants drain. “Gangsta gardener” and master of repurposing, <a href=\"http://ronfinley.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Ron Finley</a>, suggests<a href=\"https://www.masterclass.com/articles/ron-finley-how-to-grow-potatoes-in-a-sack-like-a-gangsta\" target=\"_blank\"> growing potatoes in them</a>, but he<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CAD1DIfBSuc/\" target=\"_blank\"> also uses them as a base material in his planter boxes</a>. My girlfriend and I liked how they looked so much, we used them to plant flowers we later put outside the front door.</p><p>Build a pet bed</p><p>If you want a quick and easy pet bed, it’s hard to beat a coffee sack. Take a clean one, stuff it with a pillow, put it on the ground, and watch your pets flock to it. If you want to take things further, you can<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teoK1ooITsM\" target=\"_blank\"> sew a zipper</a> to the open side of the sack to seal it up.</p><p>Craft a custom tote bag </p><p>You can use a coffee sack as the base for <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I29nGw4w6dw\" target=\"_blank\">any fabric-project you like</a>, but <a href=\"https://www.popsci.com/story/diy/build-sew-zipper-tote-bag/\" target=\"_blank\">a tote bag</a> might be the simplest. After all, you’re mostly just adding handles. Depending on your level of skill (and access to a sewing machine), you can make <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ae5HdofvviY\" target=\"_blank\">a basic tote</a> or go all in and<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daB8YUPsgTo\" target=\"_blank\"> create a gorgeous beach bag</a>. Just make sure to wash your sack first.</p><p>Create some decent decor</p><p>Coffee bags are marked with the details of their contents and origin. Some of the designs look pretty cool, especially when cleaned up. Just wash, press, and frame a sack to add a special touch to any room in your house. You’ll have to trim a bit off the edges, but a <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3gsXJZl\" target=\"_blank\">36-by-24-inch frame</a> will give you the best results.</p><p>Organize a sack race</p><p>This was my best event on sports day, so I’d back myself in a sack race over anyone—even Usain Bolt. With a couple of spare coffee sacks lying about, you can replace your routine workout with a fun and wholesome race.

However, according to a <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/315590/americans-face-mask-usage-varies-greatly-demographics.aspx\">Gallup poll</a>, almost a third of Americans say they rarely or never wear a mask in public.</p><p>This raises a question: Can the anti-maskers be persuaded to wear masks?</p><p>To some, it might appear that such a question has no ethical dimension. Wearing masks saves lives, so everyone should do it. Some even believe <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/27/opinion/us-republicans-coronavirus.html\">anti-maskers are simply selfish</a>.</p><p>But <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jVbxIksAAAAJ&#38;hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">as a philosopher</a> who studies ethics and persuasion, I argue that things are more complicated than that.</p><p>Kant on love and respect</p><p>To start, consider one of the most influential ethical frameworks in Western thought: that of the German philosopher Immanuel Kant.</p><p>According to Kant, morality is ultimately about respect and love. Respecting someone, <a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/Kant_The_Metaphysics_of_Morals/GcEmAAAAQBAJ?hl=en&#38;gbpv=1&#38;dq=kant+metaphysics+of+morals&#38;printsec=frontcover\">Kant claims</a>, is “limiting our self-esteem by the dignity of humanity in another person.” In other words, we should refrain from undermining others’ dignity.</p><p>Alongside respect, for Kant, we should also show others a certain type of love. To love others in the moral sense, <a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/Kant_The_Metaphysics_of_Morals/GcEmAAAAQBAJ?hl=en&#38;gbpv=1&#38;dq=kant+metaphysics+of+morals&#38;printsec=frontcover\">he writes</a>, is not about having a feeling, but is rather to “make others’ ends my own (provided only that these are not immoral).”</p><p>That is, moral love requires that we help others achieve their aims, as long as those aims aren’t immoral.</p><p>Altogether, this means that treating others well requires an understanding about what gives them their dignity and what things they are ultimately trying to achieve.</p><p>What is social dignity?</p><p>One could ask why trying to persuade someone to wear a mask would threaten their dignity.</p><p>Consider one type of dignity in particular: social dignity. According to ethicist <a href=\"https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/suzanne-killmister\">Suzy Killmister</a>, social dignity consists in someone <a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/contours-of-dignity-9780198844365?cc=us&#38;lang=en\">living up to the standards</a> that her community holds her to. The specific standards that matter are those which the community sees as being “shameful” to violate.</p><p>Someone’s social dignity can be damaged whether or not she accepts her society’s standards. One way this can happen is if she is a member of different social groups with conflicting standards.</p><p>For example, imagine a teenager from a conservative religious community who attends a secular public school. According to her religious community’s standards, it’s shameful to dress immodestly. According to the standards of her classmates, however, it’s shamefully unfashionable to dress conservatively. She faces a dilemma of dignity: No matter how she dresses, she cannot achieve full social dignity.</p><p>Shame and social standards</p><p>Because a significant majority of Americans do wear masks, and because of its importance in protecting public health, mask-wearing has become a social standard connected to shame.</p><p>In response, epidemiologist <a href=\"https://www.populationmedicine.org/jmarcus\">Julia Marcus</a> has recently <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/06/dudes-who-wont-wear-masks/613375/\">cautioned</a> that it’s not effective to shame people who do not wear masks. Instead, she proposed approaching anti-maskers with empathy.</p><p>To see the ethical importance of Marcus’ suggestion, consider <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/315590/americans-face-mask-usage-varies-greatly-demographics.aspx\">another finding</a> from a Gallup poll: While most groups do report always or often wearing masks in public, that’s not true for Republicans. Over 50 percent of Republicans say they never, rarely, or only sometimes do. Similarly, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/17/upshot/coronavirus-face-mask-map.html\">other studies</a> have found sharp regional differences in mask-wearing.</p><p>A Republican whose social group sees wearing a mask as shameful faces a dilemma of dignity. For example, a sheriff in Washington state <a href=\"https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/dont-be-a-sheep-sheriffs-across-u-s-rebel-against-new-statewide-mask-requirements/\">told a cheering crowd</a> that he wouldn’t enforce the state’s mask mandate. His advice was: “Don’t be a sheep.”</p><p>Similarly, psychologist <a href=\"https://faculty.lawrence.edu/glickp/\">Peter Glick</a> has suggested that wearing a mask is seen by some groups as “<a href=\"https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/masks-and-emasculation-why-some-men-refuse-to-take-safety-precautions/\">unmanly</a>” because it appears to them as a weakness.</p><p>People in such communities are subject to anti-mask standards, even as their larger society’s standards require masks. Their dignity is therefore in a precarious position. Ethically speaking, then, any respectful engagement with them calls for a recognition of that fact, not a blunt attempt at persuasion.</p><p>Making small efforts</p><p>Remember that Kant says that, alongside respecting others’ dignity, we must also help them achieve their aims, provided those aims aren’t immoral. Refusing to wear a mask might well be immoral.</p><p>However, trying to maintain one’s social status by living up to society’s standards isn’t intrinsically immoral. If that’s what is driving anti-maskers’ refusals, then Kant’s framework could help pro-maskers see the ethical nuance of the situation.</p><p>Appreciating this ethical challenge could also help those who are seeking to persuade anti-maskers. They might need to offer anti-maskers some way of maintaining their dignity in their anti-mask social groups while wearing a mask in other settings.</p><p>For example, they might find examples of conservatives, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/07/11/trum-wears-face-mask-walter-reed-visit-357249\">including President Trump</a>, who wear a mask in some contexts but not others. After all, even small efforts in mask-wearing can save lives.</p><p><img alt=\"The Conversation\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/142898/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-advanced\" style=\"border: none !important; box-shadow: none !important; margin: 0 !important; max-height: 1px !important; max-width: 1px !important; min-height: 1px !important; min-width: 1px !important; opacity: 0 !important; outline: none !important; padding: 0 !important; text-shadow: none !important\" width=\"1\"/>\n</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 30 Aug 2020 22:00:00 +0000","feedId":410,"bgimg":"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/6vCAuozVOY98Y7sQSONoJ8A77CM=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/K67RMMDL2JDYRJTGFTU74PT6CE.jpg","linkMd5":"5fe7fdf893327f53bfd4b912f7eb86fc","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn32@2020_5/2020/08/31/05-06-35-045_62fda6c7437bf332.webp","destWidth":1920,"destHeight":1280,"sourceBytes":51138,"destBytes":27388,"author":"By Colin Marshall/The Conversation","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/6vCAuozVOY98Y7sQSONoJ8A77CM=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/K67RMMDL2JDYRJTGFTU74PT6CE.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn32@2020_5/2020/08/31/05-06-35-045_62fda6c7437bf332.webp","https://counter.theconversation.com/content/142898/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-advanced":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn34@2020_3/2020/08/31/05-07-01-881_21f31e1e39ea5614.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598850394625},{"createdTime":"2020-08-31 13:06:34","updatedTime":"2020-08-31 13:06:34","title":"Toilet training your cat isn’t as great as it sounds","link":"https://www.popsci.com/story/science/toilet-training-cats/","description":"<img alt=\" Litter boxes allow cats to fulfill their natural instincts, such as digging and covering after going to the bathroom.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" height=\"1600\" src=\"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/Pi5BCL_wxuRyPuUMtvCC4kGhT6c=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/7PSRW425MFHF5DKPABIXXEVWYM.jpg\" width=\"2133\"/><br/><caption> Litter boxes allow cats to fulfill their natural instincts, such as digging and covering after going to the bathroom.

It would give you a far better perspective of the world—or at least help you be a smarter pet parent. We’re here to demystify your animals (to some extent), while also shedding advice on how you can best thrive together. Welcome to Pet Psychic.</i></p><p>A cat politely peeing into a toilet—it almost sounds like a dream. No more scooping litter twice a day, no more cluttering your living room with a clunky litter box. So understandably, toilet-training cats burst into the scene in the early 2010s, products like <a href=\"https://litterkwitter.com/\">Litter Kwitter</a> promising that your cat will be toilet trained within six weeks.</p><p>Here’s how it works. The training kit includes an instructional DVD describing a three-step regimen and concentric plastic discs to install into your toilet, which, at first, completely cover the toilet bowl. The discs can be covered with kitty litter to make your cat feel at home, perched on top of the toilet. Every two weeks, the innermost ring can be removed, until your cat can at long last poop or pee into a gaping, wide-open toilet bowl. The company’s website sings lofty praises of the process: “Your cat learns to go directly into the toilet while balancing all four paws on the seat with their rear over the hole.”</p><p>However, as cute as toilet-trained cats are, it’s not as easy as simply sharing a toilet bowl with your cat—and it could actually be detrimental to your kitty’s health. Here’s what cat behavioral specialists have to say about this controversial training process.</p><p>“The idea is nuts,” says Jackson Galaxy, cat behavior expert and host of Animal Planet’s My Cat From Hell. “It symbolizes changing the nature of what a cat is in order to better suit your purposes.”</p><p>Galaxy, who has been working with cats for twenty-five years, centers his cat-rearing philosophy around preserving and respecting the cat’s natural instincts. This includes the cat’s routine of stepping into sandy-textured litter, doing its business, and burying the waste. To deny a cat a litter box reveals the owner’s inability to compromise with a cat’s nature, and even instigate behavioral and medical issues down the line. “It’s a very unnatural move for cats to make, perching themselves precariously over water in order to eliminate,” says Galaxy.</p><p>And what if your cat falls into the toilet? Laughs aside, Lisa Stemcosky, a cat behavior consultant in the D.C. area, says that even one splash into the toilet can have long-term consequences. “That’s a traumatic event,” says Stemcosky. “They get wet, it’s terrifying.” Even if cats are successfully toilet trained, the stress surrounding going to the toilet can cause mental distress and toilet and litter aversion, especially if an accident occurs when no one is home.</p><p>Medical issues may creep up on cat owners if cats continually use the toilet. Tracking your cat’s waste may be one of the most effective ways to catch diseases and conditions early. One sift through a litter box can reveal multitudes of issues. A lack of urination can indicate a urinary tract infection, urethra blockage, or even diabetes. Diarrhea and constipation can also reveal serious underlying issues, according to Stemcosky. If your cat’s waste is flushed down the toilet, these signs may go unnoticed.</p><p>Cats who aren’t fans of the toilet might just choose not to urinate, according to Mikel Delgado, an animal behaviorist and postdoctoral fellow at the School of Veterinary Medicine at UC Davis. “They will retain their urine and hold it as long as possible,” says Delgado. “This can lead to health problems because they’re not urinating when they need to.” Long-term urine retention can lead to bladder damage, urinary tract infections, and even kidney damage.</p><p>Plus, toilet traffic might occur, especially in busy, bustling homes. And anyone who has a cat knows that they aren’t going to wait patiently in line for their turn in the bathroom. “If the seat’s up, the door’s closed, or someone’s using the toilet, they will likely find someplace else to eliminate,” says Patience Fisher, a cat behavior consultant in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The bathroom floor, the bathtub, or anywhere else in the house is fair game. One of Stomcosky’s past clients adopted an adult cat, who had previously been toilet trained. Upon entering a new home, the cat struggled to adjust to a litter box, and continued to pee in the toilet and all over the bathroom. “It can be confusing and very stressful,” says Stemcosky. Delgado, who also works as an animal behavior consultant, claims that she’s unwilling to work with a client whose cat has urinary issues unless they supply their cat with a litter box. “I feel like it’s one of the most basic things you can do to care for your cat.”</p><p>“If you don’t just want to scoop a litter box, don’t get a cat,” Galaxy says. “There’s very little that they demand of us as opposed to dogs. Their demands are few. Having a place to eliminate is one of them.”</p><p>If you do decide to take the plunge and toilet train your cat, here’s one last word of advice—don’t teach them how to flush. There’s a chance they might enjoy it a little too much.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 27 Aug 2020 17:17:24 +0000","feedId":410,"bgimg":"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/Pi5BCL_wxuRyPuUMtvCC4kGhT6c=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/7PSRW425MFHF5DKPABIXXEVWYM.jpg","linkMd5":"ae90f7b7ef68951968991bb4f34971d8","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn97@2020_3/2020/08/31/05-06-36-686_41b46270cc13104a.webp","destWidth":2133,"destHeight":1600,"sourceBytes":217683,"destBytes":87642,"author":"Candice Wang","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/Pi5BCL_wxuRyPuUMtvCC4kGhT6c=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/7PSRW425MFHF5DKPABIXXEVWYM.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn97@2020_3/2020/08/31/05-06-36-686_41b46270cc13104a.webp","https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/COUYOTHJ5JGLXJJFJA7ZS7ZQ4Y.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn31@2020_2/2020/08/31/05-07-03-396_dd3a5be32b6985b7.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598850394626},{"createdTime":"2020-08-31 13:06:34","updatedTime":"2020-08-31 13:06:34","title":"The Trump administration opened the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil companies—but none may bite","link":"https://www.popsci.com/story/environment/arctic-refuge-trump-drilling/","description":"<img alt=\"The Brooks Range sets the backdrop for vital caribou feeding grounds in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" height=\"662\" src=\"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/_kX5GP8ZqfwrEeg4eLPzeOZeNJk=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/WV6D5SH7QZH7FK4A52OHRVYU24.jpg\" width=\"1024\"/><br/><caption>The Brooks Range sets the backdrop for vital caribou feeding grounds in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska.

This story originally featured on </i><a href=\"https://theconversation.com/trump-greenlights-drilling-in-the-arctic-national-wildlife-refuge-but-will-oil-companies-show-up-144715\" target=\"_blank\">The Conversation</a>.</p><p>The Trump administration has announced that it is <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/17/climate/alaska-oil-drilling-anwr.html\">opening up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge</a> (ANWR) to oil and gas development—the latest twist in a decades-long battle over the fate of this remote area. Its timing is truly terrible.</p><p>Low oil prices, a pandemic-driven recession, and looming elections add up to highly unfavorable conditions for launching expensive drilling operations. In the longer term, the climate crisis and an ongoing shift to a lower-carbon economy raise big questions about future oil demand.</p><p>I’ve <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dCRySjIAAAAJ&#38;hl=en\">researched the US energy industry</a> for more than 20 years. As I see it, conservative Republicans have backed oil and gas production in ANWR since the 1980s for two overriding reasons. First, to increase domestic oil production and reduce dependence on “foreign oil,” a euphemism for imports from OPEC countries. This argument now is largely dead, thanks to the <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/fracking-revolution-thats-made-the-us-the-top-global-oil-producer-is-boosting-the-economy-and-curbing-emissions-too-2019-03-22/\">fracking revolution</a>, which has greatly expanded US oil and gas production.</p><p>The other motive for drilling in ANWR, I believe, is to score a major, precedent-setting victory over government policies that prioritize conservation over energy production and environmental advocacy groups that have fought for years to protect ANWR as “<a href=\"https://www.wilderness.org/articles/article/why-arctic-national-wildlife-refuge\">one of the finest examples of wilderness left on Earth</a>.” Capturing ANWR and transforming it into a locus of fossil fuel extraction would be a massive physical and symbolic triumph for politicians who believe that resource extraction is the <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/dems-and-the-gop-are-miles-apart-on-yet-another-issue-public-lands-65772\">highest use of public lands</a>.</p><p>President Trump seems to understand this, based on his recent comment that “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/17/climate/alaska-oil-drilling-anwr.html\">ANWR is a big deal that Ronald Reagan couldn’t get done and nobody could get done</a>.” But global, national, and oil industry circumstances are overwhelmingly arrayed against Trump getting it done.</p><p>Years of debate</p><p>ANWR is unarguably an ecological treasure. With 45 species of mammals and more than 200 species of birds from six continents, the refuge <a href=\"https://www.amnh.org/explore/science-bulletins/earth/documentaries/reading-the-rocks-the-search-for-oil-in-anwr/essay-northern-alaska-rich-in-wildlife-and-oil/\">is more biodiverse</a> than almost any area in the Arctic.</p><p>This is especially true of the 1002 <a href=\"https://www.fws.gov/refuge/arctic/wildlife_habitat.html\">coastal plain portion</a>, which has the largest number of polar bear dens in Alaska. It also supports <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/scientist-at-work-tracking-muskoxen-in-a-warming-arctic-70378\">muskoxen</a>, Arctic wolves, foxes, hares, migrating waterfowl, and porcupine caribou, which calve there. Most of ANWR is designated as wilderness, which puts it off-limits for development. But this <a href=\"https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL33872.pdf\">does not include the 1002 Area</a>, which was recognized as a promising area for energy development when the refuge was created in 1980 and left that way after a 1987 study confirmed its potential.</p><p>Climate change is causing <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/100-degrees-in-siberia-5-ways-the-extreme-arctic-heat-wave-follows-a-disturbing-pattern-141442\">especially rapid warming in the Arctic</a>, with probable negative effects for many of these species. Environmental advocates argue that fossil fuel production in ANWR will <a href=\"https://www.nrdc.org/protect-arctic-national-wildlife-refuge\">add to this process</a>, damaging habitat and impacting the <a href=\"https://www.alaskapublic.org/2019/07/02/in-arctic-village-gwichin-leaders-say-the-fight-to-stop-drilling-in-the-arctic-refuge-isnt-over/\">Indigenous people who rely on the wildlife</a> for subsistence. But the situation is complex: There are also <a href=\"https://www.ktoo.org/2019/07/02/in-the-alaska-village-where-anwr-is-the-backyard-many-see-drilling-as-an-opportunity/\">Indigenous groups who support ANWR development</a> for the jobs and income it would bring.</p><p>Energy companies’ interest in ANWR, meanwhile, has risen and fallen over time. The discovery of oil at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prudhoe_Bay_Oil_Field\">Prudhoe Bay</a> in 1968, followed by <a href=\"https://www.cfr.org/timeline/oil-dependence-and-us-foreign-policy\">two oil shocks in the 1970s</a>, sparked support for exploration and production in the region. But this enthusiasm faded in the late 1980s and ’90s in the face of fierce political and legal opposition and years of low oil prices.</p><p>Scientists performed two major assessments of oil reserves in the 1002 Area in <a href=\"http://dggs.alaska.gov/webpubs/usgs/b/text/b1778.pdf\">1987</a> and <a href=\"https://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/fs-0028-01/\">1998</a>. The latter study concluded that ANWR contained up to 11 billion barrels of oil that could be profitably recovered if prices were consistently high. But when prices rose between 2010 and late 2014, companies chose to focus instead on areas to the west of the refuge, where new discoveries had been made.</p><p>In the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/115/bills/hr1/BILLS-115hr1enr.pdf\">Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017</a>, a Republican-controlled Congress directed the Trump administration to open the 1002 Area to leasing. The bill required one lease sale within four years, and at least two sales within a decade. But as the Interior Department tried to comply, it was hampered by <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/15/us/ryan-zinke-interior-secretary.html\">political controversies</a> and environmental assessment requirements.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/secretary-bernhardt-signs-decision-implement-coastal-plain-oil-and-gas-leasing-program\">new Record of Decision</a>, released on August 17, 2020, determines where and how leasing will occur. It represents the Trump administration’s last chance to bring forward a well-designed leasing plan, and is certain <a href=\"https://www.arctictoday.com/with-arctic-refuge-drilling-approved-focus-shifts-to-legal-battles-and-market-forces/\">to spark legal challenges</a> from environmental and wildlife organizations.</p><p>Is ANWR oil worth it?</p><p>Toady the oil industry is facing its greatest set of challenges in modern history. They include:</p><ul><li>A collapse in oil demand and prices due to the global pandemic, with a sluggish and &#60;a href=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/oil-market-report-august-2020\"&#62;uncertain recovery&#60;/a&#62;</li><li>Companies canceling and reducing activity worldwide, with bankruptcies in the US shale industry and &#60;a href=\"https://energynow.com/2020/08/u-s-oil-gas-rig-count-falls-to-record-low-for-14th-week-baker-hughes/\"&#62;drilling rig counts&#60;/a&#62; falling back to 1940 levels</li><li>New uncertainty about future global oil demand as climate concerns push public interest and government policy toward electric vehicles, and automakers respond with new EV designs</li><li>The growing possibility of Democratic victories in the November 2020 elections, which would likely lead to policies reducing fossil fuel use</li><li>Increasing &#60;a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climate-change-barclays/barclays-pressured-by-shareholders-to-cut-fossil-fuel-financing-idUSKBN1Z700F\"&#62;investor pressure&#60;/a&#62; on banks and investment firms to reduce or eliminate support for fossil fuel projects.</li></ul><p>All of these factors compound the challenges of leasing and drilling in ANWR. Well costs there would be among the highest anywhere onshore in the US. Only one well has ever been drilled in the area, so new drilling would be purely exploratory and have a lower chance of success than in better-studied areas. Under these conditions, it would make more sense for companies that are active on Alaska’s North Slope to pursue sites they currently have under lease, which pose much lower risk.</p><p>What’s more, as I have <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/large-scale-fracking-comes-to-the-arctic-in-a-new-alaska-oil-boom-75683#comment_1264055\">argued previously</a>, it’s not clear that there’s a need to drill in ANWR. Energy companies have made new discoveries elsewhere south and west of Prudhoe Bay—most recently, the <a href=\"https://www.rigzone.com/news/pantheon_resources_makes_alaska_north_slope_discovery-13-apr-2020-161730-article/\">Talitha Field</a>, which could yield 500 million barrels or more.</p><p>Companies that pursue leases in ANWR also will have to weigh the prospects of litigation, investor anger and a tarnished brand—especially large firms with public name recognition. Shell’s experience in 2015, when it <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/09/28/shell-backtracks-on-controversial-arctic-drilling-plan/\">abandoned plans to drill offshore in the Arctic</a> under heavy pressure, indicate what other companies can expect.</p><p>If Trump is voted out of office, I expect that a Biden administration would quickly move to <a href=\"https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2020/06/most-trump-environmental-rollbacks-will-take-years-to-be-reversed/\">reverse</a> the directive for leasing in ANWR. In my view, this contested area will have far more meaning and value as a wildlife refuge in a warming world that is starting to seriously move away from hydrocarbon energy.</p><p><img alt=\"The Conversation\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/144715/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-advanced\" style=\"border: none !important; box-shadow: none !important; margin: 0 !important; max-height: 1px !important; max-width: 1px !important; min-height: 1px !important; min-width: 1px !important; opacity: 0 !important; outline: none !important; padding: 0 !important; text-shadow: none !important\" width=\"1\"/>\n</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 26 Aug 2020 22:00:00 +0000","feedId":410,"bgimg":"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/_kX5GP8ZqfwrEeg4eLPzeOZeNJk=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/WV6D5SH7QZH7FK4A52OHRVYU24.jpg","linkMd5":"75d08c1f6f029a6bfe9e927ecd932edf","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn46@2020_4/2020/08/31/05-06-54-627_e97f48d3d7fd9fac.webp","destWidth":1024,"destHeight":662,"sourceBytes":105631,"destBytes":87980,"author":"By Scott L.

There are <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/8/25/16202296/hurricane-florence-2018-evacuation-psychology\" target=\"_blank\">a lot of reasons that people stay</a> in their homes when a hurricane hits, and many of them are complex. One crucial factor: money. Housing, fuel, and food during an evacuation can <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/10/18/658258370/why-stay-during-a-hurricane-because-its-not-as-simple-as-get-out\" target=\"_blank\">cost a family of four upwards of $2,000</a>. In January 2020, surveys showed <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/21/41-percent-of-americans-would-be-able-to-cover-1000-dollar-emergency-with-savings.html\" target=\"_blank\">that less than half of Americans had $1,000</a> in savings they could use in an emergency. With tens of millions across the US <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/27/economy/unemployment-benefits-coronavirus/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">currently unemployed</a>, the number of residents with anything close to an ample emergency nest egg has likely dropped even lower. The median household income in <a href=\"https://datausa.io/profile/geo/louisiana\" target=\"_blank\">many of the affected Louisiana parishes is below $50,000</a>, with poverty rates upwards of 15 percent.</p><p>Leaving behind pets can also seem like an insurmountable hurdle for others, and though legally shelters are supposed to provide care for pets, not all actually do. Other people have loved ones with disabilities—or disabilities themselves—that makes it hard to leave, either because it’s physically a challenge or because they worry a shelter won’t be able to meet their needs.</p><p>Yet another reason: people don’t have experience with these types of storms. Many folks who have lived in the area for a long time are likely to recall prior storms that they weathered just fine, and figure they can survive whatever the next one brings as well. <a href=\"https://www.popsci.com/hurricane-category-deadly/\" target=\"_blank\">Sociologists estimate</a> that people remember the worst effects of a hurricane for just seven years, and that 85 percent of US coastal residents haven’t actually experienced a direct hit from a major hurricane before.</p><p>While the extent of Laura’s impact still remains to be seen, you may already be wondering how you can help some of the people affected. The <a href=\"http://www.disaster-ology.com/home/2020/8/26/how-to-help-after-a-disaster-covid-edition\" target=\"_blank\">best course of action, according to people who research natural disaster responses, </a>is to donate money, not things—and to send that money to local organizations rather than large non-profits. Smaller organizations are more likely to know what their community needs and to stick around for a long time after the disaster. They’ll also know exactly what supplies they need and won’t want to grapple with the tons of items that well-intentioned people send to the area. You can also look for local businesses you can support from afar, or see if you can volunteer for a non-profit like the Red Cross.</p><p>With the ongoing pandemic, physically flying to the region might not be the smartest or safest choice, especially when resources are already limited to support the people whose homes have been destroyed. If you can’t donate money, you could try donating blood or helping out with fundraising efforts for a local organization.
