Whatever endeavor you plan to succeed in, you need to be able to manage your workload well, and that <a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/getting-things-done/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">entails knowing your priorities</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/productivity/prioritize-todo-list/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Prioritization is important not just in work, but in life in general. </a>No matter how big or small a task is, you need to be able to sort out your priorities so you don&#8217;t get overwhelmed, and so you can work on every important project well and on time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So how do you prioritize anyway? Prioritization depends on a number of factors: importance, time sensitivity, costs (monetary or energetic), subsequence to a succeeding task, and more. One effective way of maximizing your opportunities and proper prioritization is through having a tool to help weigh factors and determine which task to put first. One of the best tested and proven tools on the market today is the priority matrix.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Priority Matrix is a <a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/time/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">time management system</a> or software that is supported on a number of platforms. It is a structured approach to working on what matters most or in short, prioritization, based on the level of importance and effort. Three factors are critical in using the priority matrix: cost, scope, and time. How much time will you have to allocate for a certain project? What is the scope of work? How much will it cost you in terms of effort spent and actual money or other resources involved? These are some of the things you need to consider in order to see the bigger picture using the priority matrix and learn which items are critical and which ones you can set aside.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Priority Matrix Origins</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/men-sitting.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-17749\" width=\"579\" height=\"464\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Priority Matrix is a model based on the Eisenhower method of arranging tasks according to importance and urgency in a 2&#215;2 matrix. Yes, this system was devised by President Dwight Eisenhower. The system of Eisenhower works on this principle: tasks are prioritized according to two criteria, important/unimportant and urgent/not urgent. These tasks are then handled like so:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Important/urgent tasks are done personally and immediately</li><li>Important/ not urgent tasks are done personally and with an end date or deadline</li><li>Unimportant/ urgent tasks are delegated</li><li>Unimportant/ not urgent tasks are dropped</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>What sets the priority matrix apart from the Eisenhower method is that priority matrix project management targets operations and project managers who are in charge of large initiatives and teams, and that they are tasked to make schedules more efficient in order to maximize the return of investment. Whereas the Eisenhower method can be utilized by anyone to manage time and priorities better, the priority matrix is geared toward business leaders in order to keep track of their team&#8217;s productivity levels.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Breaking Down the Priority Matrix</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"415\" height=\"383\" src=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Action-Priority-Matrix.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-17750\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you start on working your own priority matrix, it is important you understand its underlying principles. Basically, the priority matrix breaks out tasks or items into two dimensions: urgency and importance, and impact, and effort. These are then classified under four quadrants. Overall, the priority matrix helps one see the bigger picture and in turn, helps channel <a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/productivity/power-priorities/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">focus on important things.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h5>Quadrant 1 (High Impact, Low Effort)</h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Otherwise known as quick wins, these are the tasks or items classified as high impact and low effort. They&#8217;re the most attractive projects as they promise good returns for little effort. It is recommended to do these tasks first.</p>\n\n\n\n<h5>Quadrant 2 (High Impact, High Effort)</h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Also known as major projects, these tasks and projects have good returns, but they require a lot of time and effort. In order to accomplish all items classified under this quadrant, it is recommended to <a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/schedule-management/color-code-your-calendar/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">set deadlines</a> and build checkpoints into your schedule throughout the project.</p>\n\n\n\n<h5>Quadrant 3 (Low Impact, Low Effort)</h5>\n\n\n\n<p>These tasks are called Fill-Ins. These are tasks that you should do if you have free time. You can opt to have them delegated in order for you to focus on more important matters or if something better comes along. You can even decline these if you need to channel your energy on other things.</p>\n\n\n\n<h5>Quadrant 4 (Low Impact, High Effort)</h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Known as Thankless Tasks, these are projects that you should avoid adding to your schedule as they make distract you from high-value work. You can opt to do these things at a later time or decline them altogether.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to Make a Priority Matrix</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/person-with-ballpoint-pen-640x427.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-17751\" srcset=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/person-with-ballpoint-pen-640x427.jpg 640w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/person-with-ballpoint-pen-500x333.jpg 500w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/person-with-ballpoint-pen-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/person-with-ballpoint-pen-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/person-with-ballpoint-pen-2048x1365.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you understand the general principles of the <a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/productivity/prioritize-todo-list/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">priority matrix</a>, you will be able to put them into action or apply them in real life. With any task management tool, it is important to know how to best use it to maximize the effectiveness and overall impact of the priority matrix.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Follow these steps to use your matrix priority accordingly:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/productivity/prioritize-todo-list/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Make a list. List down all action items on your radar including current projects, goals, and other priorities.</a> You should also include other business activities in your to-do list so you can include them in your list of priorities.</li><li>Rank these action items. On a scale of 0 to 10, rank every item in accordance with maximum impact and level of effort required.</li><li>Use the priority matrix to plot these items. Based on their respective scores, list every item down according to the quadrant they fall under. Write them down in the matrix so you can see everything.</li><li>Prioritize accordingly. This is the part wherein you determine which critical item to work on first, which ones you can <a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/podcasts/182-delegating/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">delegate to your team</a>, and the ones to deprioritize. Which do you have to do first and which do you do next? Keep track of your progress so you don&#8217;t lose focus on the bigger picture, and so you can achieve your goals.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>The Priority Matrix can help you sort out your priorities, but the execution of tasks, whether big or small, will depend on you.
