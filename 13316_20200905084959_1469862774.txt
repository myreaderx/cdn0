why this surge of smoke tomorrow?&nbsp;</b><br /><br />The answer is that there is an upper flow pattern with a trough of low-pressure offshore and a ridge of high pressure inland, a pattern that produces enhances southerly (from the south) flow, which pushes the CA smoke northward (see map for roughly 10,000 ft tomorrow at 5 AM).<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;

Such small track errors within 4-5 days of landfall has become typical of hurricane predictions and represent an extraordinary accomplishment of numerical modeling and observation.&nbsp; Similarly, track errors of major storms approaching the West Coast have greatly improved (decreased).</div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;

NEVER use a generator or barbecue inside a home when the power goes out.&nbsp; &nbsp;</b><br /><br />As noted above, most of the deaths from Laura were from generator use inside of buildings, leading to carbon monoxide poisoning.&nbsp; Here in the Northwest there have been several deaths when folks used barbecues inside homes or garages and carbon monoxide invaded homes. Never, ever do this.<br /><br /><b>2.&nbsp; If strong winds are predicted, do not sleep in bedrooms that might be hit by a falling tree.</b><br /><br />Sleep in a lower level or in part of home/apartment that is not vulnerable.&nbsp; If no trees, no worries.<br /><br /><b>3.&nbsp; Never drive, bicycle or walk around outside during strong winds</b><br /><br />During almost every major windstorm in our region, someone gets killed or seriously injured while traveling outside.&nbsp; The chance of any individual being hit is very, very low, but if thousands are outside, someone is going to get hurt.<br /><br />Let me admit something, I almost got killed this way.&nbsp; On a windy night, I bicycled home along the Burke Gilman trail and a big branch fell about 6-7 feet behind me.&nbsp; &nbsp;That would have been the end for me if I had been a second slower.&nbsp; I am very careful about this issue now.<br /><br /><b>4.&nbsp; Forecasts are much better today than even ten years ago.&nbsp; Take the forecasts seriously.</b><br /><br />Combining excellent forecasts with common sense, the death tolls from major wind storms and hurricanes can decline to near zero.<br />_____________-<br /><br /><b style=\"background-color: white; font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot;, times, freeserif, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: xx-small;\"><span style=\"font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , &quot;times&quot; , &quot;freeserif&quot; , serif;\">My blog on the KNKX firing and cancel culture is found&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://cliffmass.blogspot.com/2020/08/my-firing-at-knkx.html\" style=\"color: #888888;\">here</a><span style=\"font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , &quot;times&quot; , &quot;freeserif&quot; , serif;\">.</span></span></b><br /><div style=\"background-color: white; font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot;, times, freeserif, serif;\"><span style=\"font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , &quot;times&quot; , &quot;freeserif&quot; , serif;\">_____</span></div><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 30 Aug 2020 18:39:00 +0000","feedId":13316,"bgimg":"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-o1C6O4mEeG0/X0v9X2ig5GI/AAAAAAAA9go/yjTTVre8nEg5ohf5ATkCjpAOBmL2uCWcQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/4344175150_e7e0d11b80_c.jpg","linkMd5":"a4dbfa97d8244862c826271a00a66267","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn95@2020_5/2020/09/05/08-49-25-760_c0d472bc7d2b1ab6.webp","destWidth":240,"destHeight":320,"sourceBytes":43679,"destBytes":26206,"author":"Cliff Mass Weather Blog","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-o1C6O4mEeG0/X0v9X2ig5GI/AAAAAAAA9go/yjTTVre8nEg5ohf5ATkCjpAOBmL2uCWcQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/4344175150_e7e0d11b80_c.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn95@2020_5/2020/09/05/08-49-25-760_c0d472bc7d2b1ab6.webp","https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1JCgAH33JVo/X0qJKVAlBLI/AAAAAAAA9f4/NhZACM578ew3QmlELy-Rn7eTMvTlfcjsACLcBGAsYHQ/s200/Screen%2BShot%2B2020-08-29%2Bat%2B9.55.39%2BAM.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn95@2020_2/2020/09/05/08-49-27-286_a67bdd205c4b8652.webp","https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AVrr_qbz-ZY/X0qUVoGADlI/AAAAAAAA9gA/INI5Z0BqRTcHSf6AtHxJWcPZpmbC3V4jQCLcBGAsYHQ/s400/Screen%2BShot%2B2020-08-29%2Bat%2B10.01.43%2BAM.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn23@2020_5/2020/09/05/08-49-27-900_0fc32a71241d1ca5.webp","https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0NsR82X_ZBc/X0qVa0K4uUI/AAAAAAAA9gI/-JV48y6kb5ozkvL5hI18ZEIyjEUU_A0kgCLcBGAsYHQ/s400/Oct1962_NewPeakGustMap_CAORWABC_InMPH_12in.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn3@2020_5/2020/09/05/08-49-58-160_d97ec3aa3463e3af.webp","https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AFCaaOAQpjg/X0vHSM4tsVI/AAAAAAAA9gY/g8fd62tRCIEHwiRFa7HpPKrgs8ByP2pwgCLcBGAsYHQ/s640/EgbcqeMX0AAGbas.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn68@2020_1/2020/09/05/08-49-27-753_4573cfcacb867fbc.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599295765677},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 16:49:25","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 16:49:25","title":"My New Weather Podcast!

</b>Based on reconnaissance aircraft and other information, the National Weather Service's National Hurricane Center had estimated that Laura was a Category Four hurricane just prior to landfall, and according to the official Saffir-Simpson scale, that means the sustained surface (10-m) winds, averaged over a few minutes, were between 130 and 156 mph (see below).&nbsp; Not gusts, sustained winds.<br /><br /><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Categories</b></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DjihUMuBfi8/X0f40yRbNZI/AAAAAAAA9eI/B3AuvoQrMI4tsnm4HXL5T-xJZ6KKzgfXgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2020-08-27%2Bat%2B11.16.44%2BAM.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em;

What were the maximum sustained winds that occurred last night as Laura made landfall?&nbsp; &nbsp;Looking at all available stations, the highest sustained wind was 98 mph at Lake Charles Airport.&nbsp; The map below shows the sustained winds at 1 AM, when the storm was just moving inland (wind barbs show sustained winds, with gusts in red).&nbsp; The blue arrow indicates Lake Charles Airport.<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;

</b>Gusts are not used as part of the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale, but, let's face it, gusts are very important.&nbsp; The big damage in most storms are&nbsp;done by the gusts.<br /><br />Below are the maximum gusts of Laura.  Two locations are extreme:  Calcasieu Pass on the coast and Lake Charles, a few miles to the north (127 and 132 mph gusts, respectively)<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-GK1sKFq5vEY/X0gGBACVbvI/AAAAAAAA9ec/LXK2gyLQ_K0EDoPOWQWYIxyhuyWEB_s5ACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2020-08-27%2Bat%2B12.13.35%2BPM.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"775\" data-original-width=\"1600\" height=\"310\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-GK1sKFq5vEY/X0gGBACVbvI/AAAAAAAA9ec/LXK2gyLQ_K0EDoPOWQWYIxyhuyWEB_s5ACLcBGAsYHQ/s640/Screen%2BShot%2B2020-08-27%2Bat%2B12.13.35%2BPM.png\" width=\"640\" /></a></div><br /><div style=\"text-align: left;\">Such strong gusts are consistent with the destruction of the NWS radar dome at Lake Charles Airport--they are rated to handle up to about 135 mph.

How strong was the storm?&nbsp; Category two or four?</b><br /><br />A key issue is friction and drag, which is much greater over land (with trees, hills, buildings, etc) that over the aerodynamically smooth water.&nbsp; &nbsp;As a result of this surface drag, winds decrease VERY rapidly over land, even if the hurricane remains relatively intact aloft.&nbsp; <br /><br />Let me illustrate this visually, by showing you a forecast by the state-of-the-art NOAA/NWS HRRR model as Laura made landfall.&nbsp; These plots show surface (10-m) surface wind in knots (1 knot=1.15 mph)<br /><br />Before landfall (9 PM PDT), a nice hurricane structure is apparent, with some winds getting to 90 knots in the eyewall.<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;

the sustained winds decline precipitously when the store goes onshore.</b><br /><br />But yet the storm can still remain very, very dangerous in the hours after landfall.<br />Why?<br /><br />First, even the reduced sustained winds (e.g., 90-100 mph in this case) can produce great damage.<br /><br />But there is more.&nbsp; Gusts don't necessarily decline as rapidly as sustained winds as the storm moves over land.<br /><br />To illustrate this, here is a plot of the&nbsp; predicted <b>gusts</b> as the storm made landfall.&nbsp; <b>Not as much a decline over land as for sustained winds.</b>&nbsp; Gusts are caused by the intermittent mixing down of faster (higher momentum) air from aloft down to the surface.&nbsp; So even if winds are slower down lower, sometimes air from aloft...where the winds are still blowing hard...can be mixed to the surface.&nbsp; So gusts can hold out longer than sustained winds as a storm makes landfall.<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5L-bBo2mMKg/X0gOJC1kyFI/AAAAAAAA9fM/Z7horcSuRkMh8iEpGdjO5qpJ6Y4S1OD8wCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/gust_t510m_f09.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em;
