For each week, we’re diving into a key area and this week we’re focusing on Android Beyond Phones. Today, we’ll be talking about cars.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\nSince 2014, Google has been committed to bringing the familiarity of apps and services from Android phones into the car in a safe and seamless way. We’re continuing to see strong momentum and adoption of both <a href=\"https://www.android.com/auto/\">Android Auto</a> and <a href=\"https://source.android.com/devices/automotive/start/what_automotive\">Android Automotive OS</a>, and are excited to share new improvements that provide app developers the opportunity to reach more users in the car.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Android Auto momentum</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nWe launched <a href=\"https://www.android.com/auto/\">Android Auto</a> for users to stay connected on-the-go and more easily access their Android phones on their car displays— while staying focused on the road. Android Auto is currently available with nearly every major car manufacturer and is on track to be in more than 100 million cars in the coming months. Many car manufacturers, including General Motors, BMW and Kia, have also added support for wireless connections, making it easier for drivers to use Android Auto as soon as they get into their car. We’re continuing to add <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/android/five-new-android-features--/\">new features</a> to make the experience more seamless for users and help developers reach more drivers with in-car apps.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Expanding Android Auto’s app ecosystem</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nOne of our most common requests for Android Auto continues to be support for more apps in the car. We currently have over 3,000 apps in Google Play whose in-car experiences have been purpose-built for driving. \n</p>\n<p>\nToday, we’re showcasing our work with early access partners to build apps in new categories for Android Auto, including navigation, parking and electric vehicle charging. Using our new Android for Cars App Library, we’re able to ensure that all tasks within an app can be achieved with minimal glances or taps.\n</p>\n\n\n<center> <a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-vKb1-7G-Hhc/XzGjZ55QbCI/AAAAAAAAPcs/o6EntDHnGbcodAILNSb6RwYYA_9sNrhvwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Image%2B1_%2BEAP%2BAndroid%2BAuto%2Bapp%2Bexpansion.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" ><img style=\"width:600px\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-vKb1-7G-Hhc/XzGjZ55QbCI/AAAAAAAAPcs/o6EntDHnGbcodAILNSb6RwYYA_9sNrhvwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Image%2B1_%2BEAP%2BAndroid%2BAuto%2Bapp%2Bexpansion.png\" data-original-width=\"1600\" data-original-height=\"835\" alt= image of Android Auto's partners/></a> </center>\n\n<p id=\"imgCaption\"> Early access partners for new apps on Android Auto </p>\n\n<p>\nTo mitigate driver distraction, we collaborated with government, industry and academic institutions to develop our own <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFHjmDrUF9A\">best practice guidelines</a> that we apply to every aspect of our product development process. With our standard templates and guidelines, developers have the tools to easily optimize their apps for cars, without needing to become an expert in driver distraction. \n</p>\n<p>\nOur early access partners will be releasing new apps to their beta testers by the end of this year. Pending additional testing and feedback, we then plan to make these APIs publicly available for all developers to build Android Auto apps in these categories.\n</p>\n<p>\n\n<center> <a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-q1PE31sWfXk/XzHU2kf2eJI/AAAAAAAAPdw/6DQF9Q3JFpMZP8mMTbB8HEMOQeyK74ljACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/final_5f31ce27e5bc060015ae78e4_186813%2B%25282%2529%2B%25281%2529.gif\" imageanchor=\"1\" ><img style=\"width:500px\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-q1PE31sWfXk/XzHU2kf2eJI/AAAAAAAAPdw/6DQF9Q3JFpMZP8mMTbB8HEMOQeyK74ljACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/final_5f31ce27e5bc060015ae78e4_186813%2B%25282%2529%2B%25281%2529.gif\" data-original-width=\"1280\" data-original-height=\"762\" alt= Android Auto gif/></a> </center>\n\n<p id=\"imgCaption\"> We're partnering with some of the leading navigation, parking and electric vehicle charging apps around the world including ChargePoint, SpotHero and Sygic. </p>\n\n<p>\n<strong>Android Automotive OS adoption</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nMore recently, we introduced <a href=\"https://source.android.com/devices/automotive/start/what_automotive\">Android Automotive OS</a> as a full-stack, open source and highly customizable platform powering vehicle infotainment systems. With Android Automotive OS, car manufacturers are able to have apps and services like Google Assistant, Google Maps and Google Play built into vehicles so that a mobile device is not required for common activities like navigation, downloading third-party apps and listening to media. <a href=\"https://www.polestar.com/us/polestar-2/\">Polestar 2</a>, the first car running Android Automotive OS with Google built in, is now on the road and available for customers globally. In addition, Volvo Cars, Renault, General Motors and more have announced plans for infotainment systems powered by Android Automotive OS with Google apps and services built-in.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Extending the reach of media apps in cars</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nAs more manufacturers begin to ship cars with infotainment systems powered by Android Automotive OS, developers have the opportunity to deliver a seamless media experience using Google Play in the car. If you already have a media app for Android Auto, you can extend the reach by adding support for Android Automotive OS. The process for porting over your apps is simple with most of the work already done, just <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/training/cars/media/automotive-os\">follow these steps</a>.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Making it easier to develop media apps for Android Automotive OS </strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nFor the past year, we have been on a journey to allow app developers to design, develop, test and publish media apps directly on Google Play in the car. We are happy to share that this is now possible.\n</p>\n\n<center> <div id=\"flexParent\">\n<a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-sZ0_6GQV6zY/XzGmSw3Q2-I/AAAAAAAAPdE/6wa8TYfWFQM-krqiwqS4EvoQugyy7UMswCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Image%2B3_%2BPolestar%2B2%2BEmulator.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" ><img id=\"flexImg\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-sZ0_6GQV6zY/XzGmSw3Q2-I/AAAAAAAAPdE/6wa8TYfWFQM-krqiwqS4EvoQugyy7UMswCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Image%2B3_%2BPolestar%2B2%2BEmulator.png\" alt=\"Android Auto image\" /></a>\n\n\n<a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-lSjoQ291WB0/XzGmvaJXcnI/AAAAAAAAPdM/jzYb7GuOkecrwqj5JajFsw-y0tFiUXBrwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Image%2B4_%2BGoogle%2BGeneric%2BEmulator.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" ><img id=\"flexImg\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-lSjoQ291WB0/XzGmvaJXcnI/AAAAAAAAPdM/jzYb7GuOkecrwqj5JajFsw-y0tFiUXBrwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Image%2B4_%2BGoogle%2BGeneric%2BEmulator.png\" alt= \"Image of Polestar 2 and Google Generic Automative system\" /></a>\n</div> </center>\n\n\n<p id=\"imgCaption\"> Polestar 2 and Google Generic Automotive system images for Android emulator </p>\n\n<p>\nWe have made updates to the Android Automotive OS <a href=\"https://designguidelines.withgoogle.com/automotive-os-apps/\">design guidelines</a> and <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/training/cars/media/automotive-os\">development documentation</a> for you to add support for your media apps.
