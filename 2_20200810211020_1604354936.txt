The notion of pitting characters from different properties and different media against one another is exciting to discuss. And when it comes to letting fans live out these arguments, there are few better outlets than fighting games.</p>\n<p>Even within a genre <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/12/smash-bros-ultimate-review-the-best-fighting-game-on-any-nintendo-system/\">known for character-merging crossovers</a>, there's one two-decade-old game that reigns supreme when it comes to pitting a wide variety of characters against one another. That program is <em>MUGEN</em>, derived from the Japanese word for \"infinite,\" which is an appropriate name for a program that provides near limitless potential for players to create new fighting games and characters.</p>\n<p><em>MUGEN</em> began life just before the turn of the century as a PC-based side-scrolling shoot-'em-up title, created by a small company called Elecbyte. The team was originally experimenting with creating an engine to handle the rigors of so-called shmup games but found that it just wasn't living up to what they had hoped to create. Taking inspiration from <a href=\"https://www.scary-crayon.com/games/sf2pc/\">a PC Korean <em>Street Fighter 2</em> hack known as <em>SFIBM</em></a>, Elecbyte decided to change course from a shooter to a 2D fighting game engine.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1697826#p3\">Read 31 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1697826&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=SfVNzm7plFI:V9RCoUdB9_Y:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=SfVNzm7plFI:V9RCoUdB9_Y:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=SfVNzm7plFI:V9RCoUdB9_Y:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=SfVNzm7plFI:V9RCoUdB9_Y:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=SfVNzm7plFI:V9RCoUdB9_Y:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=SfVNzm7plFI:V9RCoUdB9_Y:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 10 Aug 2020 19:51:18 +0000","feedId":2,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Goku_vs_Ronald-800x600.jpg","linkMd5":"a38071f7e9b6ce3e6c3f126c1a58c59d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn19@2020_4/2020-08-10/1597093784582_39f8835eeb4ef189.webp","author":"Ars Staff","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Goku_vs_Ronald-800x600.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn19@2020_4/2020-08-10/1597093784582_39f8835eeb4ef189.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=SfVNzm7plFI:V9RCoUdB9_Y:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn39@2020_1/2020-08-10/1597093816992_51ac7e05c6c0af0d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=SfVNzm7plFI:V9RCoUdB9_Y:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn55@2020_3/2020-08-10/1597093811080_277b0ac7e1123242.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn59@2020_2/2020-08-10/1597093817311_24b37a558f772a43.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn43@2020_3/2020-08-10/1597093818929_f9fb6170e557e50a.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-11 05:09:23","updatedTime":"2020-08-11 05:09:23","title":"The 2021 Polestar 2 has a great cabin—and deep Android integration","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1697885","description":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n<figure class=\"intro-image intro-left\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2021-Polestar-2-1-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"A white Polestar 2\"><p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2021-Polestar-2-1.jpg\" class=\"enlarge-link\" data-height=\"2000\" data-width=\"3000\">Enlarge</a> <span class=\"sep\">/</span> On the road with the new Polestar 2.  (credit: Polestar)</p>  </figure><div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n\n<p>Any day I get to drive a new battery electric car is a good day. Which made last Friday a good day, because we got our first drive in the $59,900 Polestar 2. It's the first mass-production model from a new standalone brand that was spun out of Volvo and Geely a few years ago. And the<em> tl;dr</em> is that the Polestar 2 is a stylish sedan with a wonderful interior, some very fancy suspension bits, and oh—it's also the first car to use Google's Android Automotive OS.</p>\n<h2>A brief history of Polestar</h2>\n<p>Once upon a time, Polestar was to Volvo as AMG is to Mercedes-Benz—a tuning company that <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/08/the-2017-s60-polestar-a-volvo-with-a-nurburgring-lap-record/\">spiffed up more pedestrian models</a>, imbuing them with a little Nürburgring magic. But in 2017, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/10/volvo-tears-up-the-rules-with-a-subscription-only-600-hp-electric-gt/\">Volvo and Geely (which owns the Swedish automaker) spun Polestar out</a> as an independent company, one focused on sustainability and performance. Its first product was the Polestar 1, a hand-built $150,000 plug-in hybrid GT <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/11/the-polestar-1-is-a-turbocharged-supercharged-plug-in-hybrid-enigma/\">that dazzled me when I drove it in late 2019</a>.</p>\n<p>But with a total production run of only 1,500 cars over three years, you can think of the Polestar 1 like a calling card or a statement of intent. The future of Polestar is purely electric (so no more PHEVs)—and shipping cars in much greater volumes. By the end of 2021, we'll see the Polestar 3, an SUV that promises to look a lot like the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/04/polestars-precept-avoids-the-stereotypes-of-performance-car-design/\">stunning Precept concept</a> shown off in April. But first, there's the Polestar 2. (Interesting fact: because Polestar is recognized as a standalone OEM, it has its own allocation of 200,000 vehicles for the IRS plug-in tax credit, as opposed to being counted together with Volvo.)</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1697885#p3\">Read 26 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1697885&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=J7b-0Rcz1l0:AwFhx1Dbg3k:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=J7b-0Rcz1l0:AwFhx1Dbg3k:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=J7b-0Rcz1l0:AwFhx1Dbg3k:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=J7b-0Rcz1l0:AwFhx1Dbg3k:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=J7b-0Rcz1l0:AwFhx1Dbg3k:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=J7b-0Rcz1l0:AwFhx1Dbg3k:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 10 Aug 2020 19:03:35 +0000","feedId":2,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2021-Polestar-2-1-800x533.jpg","linkMd5":"ba1b3f9ed3b318d0bf9bcfe951e5b494","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn23@2020_3/2020-08-10/1597093792653_e04c95d8ba59ea43.webp","author":"Jonathan M.

Second, Google is relaunching the Maps app on the Apple Watch, with turn-by-turn directions.</p>\n<p>CarPlay's dashboard mode was introduced in iOS 13 late last year, but it only supported Apple Maps. Apple began offering other developers the ability to take advantage of it in March with the release of iOS 13.4, and today marks the finalization of Google's support for the feature. Google's <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/maps/new-ways-get-around-google-maps-ios/\">blog post</a> announcing the update says it should go into effect for all users of CarPlay-supported vehicles today.</p>\n<p>The new Google Maps app for Apple Watch won't arrive today, though. Instead, Google promises the app is launching worldwide \"in the coming weeks.\" The app will offer \"step-by-step\" directions for driving, walking, cycling, or taking public transit.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1697898#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1697898&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=MGd20CZt_wU:S681v9ax-wE:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=MGd20CZt_wU:S681v9ax-wE:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=MGd20CZt_wU:S681v9ax-wE:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=MGd20CZt_wU:S681v9ax-wE:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=MGd20CZt_wU:S681v9ax-wE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=MGd20CZt_wU:S681v9ax-wE:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 10 Aug 2020 19:10:39 +0000","feedId":2,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/apple_watch_app.gif","linkMd5":"3d77f9cdaf7c4df88169fdb01460aaa8","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn15@2020_6/2020-08-10/1597093790287_caa71a448b3b5e0d.webp","author":"Samuel Axon","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/apple_watch_app.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn15@2020_6/2020-08-10/1597093790287_caa71a448b3b5e0d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=MGd20CZt_wU:S681v9ax-wE:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn67@2020_3/2020-08-10/1597093812990_8ab771082058b79f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=MGd20CZt_wU:S681v9ax-wE:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn51@2020_6/2020-08-10/1597093813101_b13c117f3c43e778.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn59@2020_2/2020-08-10/1597093817311_24b37a558f772a43.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn43@2020_3/2020-08-10/1597093818929_f9fb6170e557e50a.webp"}}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-08-11 05:09:23","updatedTime":"2020-08-11 05:09:23","feedId":2,"fetchDate":"Mon, 10 Aug 2020 21:09:23 +0000","fetchMs":61,"handleMs":1488,"totalMs":58150,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":20,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"52.31.45.143","hostName":"europe-001.herokuapp.com","requestId":"188f0f20cceb49238adf11b4da64cfaa_2","bgimgsTotal":3,"bgimgsGithubTotal":3,"articlesImgsTotal":11,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":11},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-05-30 17:21:38","updatedTime":"2020-08-11 02:41:22","id":2,"name":"Ars Technica","url":"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/arstechnica/index","subscriber":null,"website":null,"icon":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/cropped-ars-logo-512_480-32x32.png","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn39@2020_5/2020-08-10/1597093762452_5d81b97433efbdc7.png","description":"Serving the Technologist for more than a decade.
