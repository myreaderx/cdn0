That&#8217;s a lot of Glorias, and the two foremost incarnations of the feminist firebrand will be played by Julianne Moore and Alicia Vikander during (as the book suggests) her Greyhound bus travels. Glorias will appear onscreen together. They&#8217;ll have conversations. They&#8217;re reclaiming the &#8220;those crazy women&#8221; label for themselves under the direction of Julie Taymor (<em>Frida</em>), who&#8217;s clearly operating again here under a labor of love with what promises to be an inventive and nontraditional biopic approach.</p>\n<p>Following a Sundance debut and <a title=\"\" href=\"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_glorias\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">largely positive</a> reviews, the movie&#8217;s coming to Amazon Prime (and VOD) on September 30, by way of Roadside Attractions and LD Entertainment. The film also features a busload of brilliant actresses in other activist roles, including Kimberly Guerrero as Wilma Mankiller (&#8220;I earned it,&#8221; she says of her surname), Janelle Monae as Dorothy Pitman Hughes, Bette Midler as Bella Abzug, and Lorraine Toussaint Flo Kennedy. The film will trace Steinem&#8217;s legacy all the way from her 1940s Ohio childhood to her founding of <em>Ms.</em> magazine to her 1960s women&#8217;s liberation movement leadership and beyond. From the <a title=\"\" href=\"https://www.sundance.org/projects/the-glorias\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sundance Institute</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Julie Taymor brings her signature inventiveness and audacity to craft a complex tapestry of one of the most iconic and legendary figures of modern history, based on Steinem’s own memoir My Life on the Road. Remarkable performances by Julianne Moore and Alicia Vikander steer an engaging cast with strong supporting turns from Janelle Monáe and Bette Midler. Taymor makes her own rules in this dazzling ode to self-reflection, exploring the importance of forging your own path and embracing the challenge of the open road.</p></blockquote>\n<p><em>The Glorias</em> is coming to Amazon Prime and VOD on September 30.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?a=jQ5e7-QLaQw:FCoazXJ3akU:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?a=jQ5e7-QLaQw:FCoazXJ3akU:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?i=jQ5e7-QLaQw:FCoazXJ3akU:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?a=jQ5e7-QLaQw:FCoazXJ3akU:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?a=jQ5e7-QLaQw:FCoazXJ3akU:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?a=jQ5e7-QLaQw:FCoazXJ3akU:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?i=jQ5e7-QLaQw:FCoazXJ3akU:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/uproxx/features/~4/jQ5e7-QLaQw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 03 Sep 2020 15:36:30 +0000","feedId":6617,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=qj6IDK7rITs","linkMd5":"4c6f8db6e25c293dca656600bb308fca","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn89@2020_5/2020/09/04/17-11-02-428_c8fa5e32ae89b18f.webp","destWidth":113,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":1072,"destBytes":460,"author":"Kimberly Ricci","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn89@2020_5/2020/09/04/17-11-02-428_c8fa5e32ae89b18f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?i=jQ5e7-QLaQw:FCoazXJ3akU:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn82@2020_4/2020/09/04/17-11-22-728_053870bc0f567eb2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn45@2020_2/2020/09/04/17-11-18-942_f1234b5e3acb72a6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?i=jQ5e7-QLaQw:FCoazXJ3akU:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn93@2020_5/2020/09/04/17-11-19-203_a5cdf5af0b432d5f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/uproxx/features/~4/jQ5e7-QLaQw":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn74@2020_1/2020/09/04/17-11-21-701_b5fa49118ab1bfa8.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599239462313},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 01:11:02","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 01:11:02","title":"Robert Pattinson Reportedly Has COVID-19, Which Forced ‘The Batman’ To Shut Down Production","link":"https://uproxx.com/?p=402536789","description":"\t<div class=\"featured-image\">\n\t\t<figure class=\"post-thumbnail\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"upx-component upx-image\"><div class=\"image-holder\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"660\" src=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/pattinson.jpg?w=1600&#38;h=660&#38;crop=1\" class=\"attachment-article-featured size-article-featured skip-lazy\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/pattinson.jpg?resize=1200,495 1200w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/pattinson.jpg?resize=1600,660 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) calc(100vw - 20px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 40px), (min-width: 1025px) 1024px, 1024px\" /></div></div><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span class=\"wp-media-credit\">Getty Image</span></figcaption>\t\t</figure>\n\t</div>\n\t<p>It was only a few days that Matt Reeves&#8217;

In another timeline, Disney’s live-action remake of <em>Mulan</em>, their animated favorite from 1998, would have hit theaters nationwide in late March. That, of course, did not happen. Instead its owners came up with a unique solution: The pricey picture would <a href=\"https://uproxx.com/movies/mulan-disney-plus-additional-fee/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">debut on Disney+</a> on September 4, but for the fairly large sum of $30.</p>\n<p>But that brought up another question: When would it be subsumed into the rest of the Disney+ coffers, available to all subscribers? <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2020/09/disney-reveals-mulan-release-date-for-all-disney-subscribers-after-30-premier-access-run-1234569473/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">As per <em>Deadline</em></a>, there’s now an answer for that: At 11:59pm on November 3, Mulan will disappear from the service, to return a month later. So: Decemer-ish.</p>\n<p>To answer another question: Once you pay the enormous fee to watch <em>Mulan</em>, which you’ll be able to do for two whole months, how long and how often will you be able to watch it? Indefinitely, as per <em>Deadline</em>, allowing viewers to really get a bang for their considerable bucks. (Most PVOD titles disappear after a mere 48-hour window.)

Besides some tasty veg, meat, or fish to grill, you&#8217;ll also need some serious BBQ sauce to smother whatever you&#8217;re cooking. But what&#8217;s the <a href=\"https://uproxx.com/life/best-barbecue-tips-from-an-expert/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">best BBQ</a> sauce to have on hand when you fire up the grill or smoker?

For us, a great BBQ sauce starts with the marrying of an umami tomato base and molasses sweetness. From there, a little tang and spice need to be present to varying degrees of intensity, but usually fairly balanced. After that, things get too pinned to individual palates to really dig into here. </p>\n<p>So, to find out what <a href=\"https://uproxx.com/topic/according-to-the-masses/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the people</a> use when they&#8217;re barbecuing in their backyards, we popped over to Ranker. There was a list of the <a title=\"\" href=\"https://www.ranker.com/list/the-very-best-bbq-sauces/analise.dubner?ref=browse_list_5&#38;amp;l=2&#38;amp;pos=79\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Best BBQ Sauce Brands</a> with over 50,000 votes, and that felt like a good enough quorum for us (though, we had to combine a couple of rankings as they were for the same sauces). So, let&#8217;s dive into the best BBQ sauces you can buy right now and use this weekend. </p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Related: <a title=\"\" href=\"https://uproxx.com/life/best-bbq-sauces-according-to-masses/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Perfect Bourbon BBQ Sauce Recipe For Your Summer Grilling</a></strong></div>\n<h3>10.

The sauce is billed as a &#8220;Western North Carolina style sauce&#8221; that leans into a foundation of sweetness from a mix of honey and molasses next to plenty of tang. The sauce is so beloved that it continually <a title=\"\" href=\"http://bonesuckin.com/Bone-Suckin-Sauce-Press.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">tops</a> &#8220;best BBQ sauce&#8221; lists around the country. </p>\n<p><strong>Best For:</strong> Chicken Thighs and Legs</p>\n<h3>7.

Their Sweet Heat sauce combines a base of molasses and brown sugar with chipotle chili sauce, giving it a mild yet distinctly sharp edge. There&#8217;s also a nice edge of apple cider vinegar tang, tying the whole damn sauce together. </p>\n<p><strong>Best For:</strong> Thick Cut BBQ Bacon</p>\n<h3>5.

You can use it on some chicken, we guess. But the sauce leans a little more sweet than tangy. Also, it&#8217;s $1.50 for a bottle. You can&#8217;t expect hand-crafted greatness at that price point. </p>\n<p><strong>Best For:</strong> Dipping <a href=\"https://uproxx.com/life/best-fast-food-chicken-tenders-ranked-2020/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Chicken Tenders</a></p>\n<h3>4.

We love Coors Light around here because it gets the job done and is perfectly fine for what it is. Still, there&#8217;s a plastic presence here that&#8217;s a little off-putting.</p>\n<p><strong>Best For:</strong> Dipping Chicken McNuggets</p>\n<h3>3. Stubbs Original BBQ Sauce</h3>\n<div class=\"embed-holder\" style=\"--embed-ratio:100%;\"><iframe width=\"320\" height=\"320\" src=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BBh2FECpz6d/embed/\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></div>\n<p><strong>Price:</strong> <a title=\"\" href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/Stubb-s-Original-Legendary-Bar-B-Q-Sauce-36-oz/36299150?athcpid=36299150&#38;athpgid=athenaItemPage&#38;athcgid=null&#38;athznid=PWVUB&#38;athieid=v0&#38;athstid=CS004&#38;athguid=111a0d31-007-17452eb640fd17&#38;athancid=null&#38;athena=true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">$4.22</a> for a 36-oz. bottle</p>\n<p><strong>The Sauce:</strong> Stubb&#8217;s Original should be in your fridge right now.

The sauce, of course, utilizes Jack Daniel&#8217;s Tennesee Whiskey with a mix of apple cider vinegar, pineapple juice, brown sugar, and tamarind paste. It&#8217;s bold and unique.</p>\n<p><strong>Best For:</strong> Beef Ribs</p>\n<h3>1.

The important thing is that it&#8217;s Friday, and we are here to have some fun.</em></p>\n<h3>ITEM NUMBER ONE &#8212; Robot news</h3>\n<p>Background first, because history is important. In <em>Rocky IV</em>, the classic work of cinema in which Rocky Balboa avenges his friend’s death and single-handedly ends the Cold War by whupping a roided-up Russian superhuman on Christmas Day in Moscow, Rocky gifts his brother-in-law, the charming and perpetually unshaven grump Paulie, a talking robot. Like, a full-on robot, not a Roomba or one of those little robot dogs. Here, look. </p>\n<div class=\"embed-holder\" style=\"--embed-ratio:56.25%;\"><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/cku6oPGWW7Q?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></div>\n<p>It is, to be very clear, hilarious and extremely 1980s, in a way very few things are. People were obsessed with robots for a chunk of the 1980s and 90s. Robots popped up in all sorts of television shows and movies, and, except for your Terminators and such, were usually friendly and helpful. It was a very optimistic time. People had yet to discover what technology and algorithms had in store for us. They thought we’d have polite robot butlers that would make us pancakes and do our laundry; instead, we have tiny supercomputers that we refuse to put down for one single second and that feed our once-sweet aunts and uncles a steady stream of conspiracy theories and thinly-disguised propaganda. It’s not ideal. </p>\n<p>Anyway, Sylvester Stallone is preparing a new director’s cut of the film for its 35th anniversary, and he announced it on Instagram, and everything was proceeding at a normal clip until we reached this section of the comments on the post. </p>\n<figure id=\"402536968\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-402536968\" src=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/rocky-robot.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"488\" srcset=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/rocky-robot.jpg 488w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/rocky-robot.jpg?resize=300,333 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 488px) 100vw, 488px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span class=\"wp-media-credit\">instagram</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>I will get to the substance of this issue in a second, but first, take a minute to consider two things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Please say “The robot is going to the junkyard forever” in your best and/or worst Stallone voice, out loud, at least a dozen times throughout the day</li>\n<li>Please picture Sylvester Stallone wearing reading glasses and sitting at a laptop pecking out replies to comments on his Instagram with his two meaty index fingers</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But yes, this all raises an important question: Should Sylvester Stallone cut Paulie’s robot from the director’s cut of <em>Rocky IV</em>? Let’s look at both sides of the argument.</p>\n<p>THE CASE FOR KEEPING THE ROBOT</p>\n<p>The robot is very funny and watching Paulie react to it cracks me up. I would be sad if it just disappeared. I would like more of the robot, actually. And there’s more of it there to give me, <a href=\"https://screencrush.com/rocky-iv-directors-cut-no-robot/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">as Screencrush explained</a> recently. </p>\n<blockquote><p>Removing Paulie’s Robot is particularly upsetting because there were additional scenes with him that were previously left on the cutting room floor. In one interview [the robot&#8217;s creator Robert] Doornick describes a scene that was cut where “Paulie and the robot had developed an odd couple relationship, with the robot complaining that Paulie always slept in the same t-shirt and made too much cigar smoke. The robot ‘found it offensive to [his] sensors.’” so then Paulie messes with the robot’s circuits and changes it from male to female “Most people in the movie don’t understand why the robot switched from a normal voice to a female voice,” Doornick said. “That’s why.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>I absolutely adore that Sylvester Stallone got three <em>Rockys</em> into this franchise and then decided, screw it, I’m throwing an entire robot subplot into my boxing movie about death and loss and ongoing Cold War tensions. I’m mad this much of it was cut already. I’ll be heartbroken if he cuts the rest, in part because it’s always a bummer when filmmakers go back and screw around with their works many decades later, and in part because, again, the whole thing is so cheesy and goofy and so aggressively 1980s that it just fits. It’s a time capsule. Leave it alone, Sly. </p>\n<p>THE CASE FOR CUTTING THE ROBOT</p>\n<p>Rocky is a Philadelphia icon and Philadelphia has a long and storied history of wiping friendly robots out of existence. And when I refer to this long and storied history, what I mean is HitchBOT. You remember HitchBOT, yes? If not, allow me to direct you to <a title=\"\" href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2015/08/03/us/hitchbot-robot-beheaded-philadelphia-feat/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this CNN report</a>, headlined &#8220;HitchBOT, the hitchhiking robot, gets beheaded in Philadelphia&#8221;:</p>\n<blockquote><p>HitchBOT, the cheerful hitchhiking robot that had made cross-country trips across Canada, the Netherlands and Germany, had intended to travel across the United States as well. Instead, it survived all of 300 miles on the mean streets of the U.S.A.</p>\n<p>Two weeks after beginning its U.S. trip in Boston, the robot was vandalized in Philadelphia, the team overseeing the robot said in a statement.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It is fitting and accurate that Philadelphia’s most iconic fictional figure would eliminate this robot. Good riddance. </p>\n<p>VERDICT</p>\n<p>Sylvester Stallone should keep the robot in the director’s cut of <em>Rocky IV</em> but add a scene where a group of local toughs stomp it out on the street. A healthy compromise. </p>\n<h3>ITEM NUMBER TWO— Chadwick Boseman was good at everything</h3>\n<figure id=\"402531930\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-402531930\" src=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/chadwick-boseman-marvel-tribute.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" srcset=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/chadwick-boseman-marvel-tribute.jpg 710w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/chadwick-boseman-marvel-tribute.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/chadwick-boseman-marvel-tribute.jpg?resize=650,366 650w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/chadwick-boseman-marvel-tribute.jpg?resize=150,85 150w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/chadwick-boseman-marvel-tribute.jpg?resize=328,185 328w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/chadwick-boseman-marvel-tribute.jpg?resize=387,218 387w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/chadwick-boseman-marvel-tribute.jpg?resize=460,259 460w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/chadwick-boseman-marvel-tribute.jpg?resize=196,110 196w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 710px) 100vw, 710px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span class=\"wp-media-credit\">Marvel</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Chadwick Boseman passed away from cancer at age 43. Every part of that sentence is awful. He was so young and so talented and had so much more to do and to give. I’ve read <a href=\"https://uproxx.com/entertainment/ryan-coogler-tribute-chadwick-boseman-black-panther/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">every</a> tribute <a href=\"https://uproxx.com/movies/chadwick-boseman-tributes-marvel-cinematic-universe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">to him</a> by <a href=\"https://uproxx.com/movies/shuri-black-panther-chadwick-boseman-death-tribute-instagram/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">all of</a> his <a href=\"https://uproxx.com/movies/shuri-black-panther-chadwick-boseman-death-tribute-instagram/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">co-stars</a> and <a href=\"https://uproxx.com/movies/michael-b-jordan-chadwick-boseman-tribute/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">collaborators</a>, and I’ve read every other story about him I’ve seen this week, too, including the one about how <a href=\"https://uproxx.com/movies/chadwick-boseman-beat-cancer-black-panther-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">he thought he had it beat</a> as recently as last month. It sucks. It sucks in every way. It would have sucked even if he wasn’t incredibly talented, but it sucks especially because of that. </p>\n<p>A lot of the focus this week has been on his work in <em>Black Panther</em>, and in biopics as Jackie Robinson and Thurgood Marshall. This is understandable, and correct, and good. He brought a kind of quiet power to those roles that leaped off the screen and brought them to life. He was so good in <em>Black Panther</em>. He was so, so good, even as he was playing against a charismatic and colorful villain in Michael B. Jordan’s Killmonger. That’s not easy. It also shouldn’t be a surprise, because he was kind of great at everything. </p>\n<p>For example, did you remember that Chadwick Boseman appeared in an episode of <em>Justified</em> earlier in his career? Because he did. He showed up in the second season as a character named Ralph “Flex” Beeman who could have very easily been one of many forgotten goons on the show. But he was great in the role. I remember watching it at the time and thinking “This guy kind of rules.” I was sad they killed him off at the end of the episode, for a few reasons, not the least of which being that he got to deliver one of the show’s best lines, which I will present here without context, because it doesn’t need it. </p>\n<figure id=\"402536938\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-402536938\" src=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/just-tchalla.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" srcset=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/just-tchalla.jpg 700w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/just-tchalla.jpg?resize=300,165 300w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/just-tchalla.jpg?resize=650,357 650w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span class=\"wp-media-credit\">FX</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>He was also terrific as a host on SNL, which I say both because it is true and because it will allow me to embed the Black Jeopardy sketch where he appeared in character as T’Challa. </p>\n<div class=\"embed-holder\" style=\"--embed-ratio:56.25%;\"><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/hzMzFGgmQOc?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></div>\n<p>Again, this all just sucks very much.

The first time, just take it all in. Then, the second time, use every ounce of power your brain can muster to replace Daniel Craig with Steve Buscemi every time he appears. </p>\n<p>Much better, right? Here to help </p>\n<h3>ITEM NUMBER FOUR &#8212; Look, if we&#8217;re going to do this, let&#8217;s really do it</h3>\n<figure id=\"402516575\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-402516575\" src=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/harry-meghan-markle.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" srcset=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/harry-meghan-markle.jpg 1024w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/harry-meghan-markle.jpg?resize=300,161 300w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/harry-meghan-markle.jpg?resize=650,349 650w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/harry-meghan-markle.jpg?resize=768,413 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span class=\"wp-media-credit\">Getty Image</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Back when Prince Harry and Megan Markle dipped on the monarchy and came to America, the strong suspicion among many people whose job or hobby it is to suspect these things was that they would end up in Los Angeles doing Hollywood things. It took a little while, but it did finally happen this week. The former royals signed a big honking deal with Netflix, which, between this and the big honking deal with the Obamas, is now very much in the business of making big honking deals with power couples who have recently left positions of power. <a href=\"https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/prince-harry-meghan-markle-netlix-1234757040/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Variety has the details</a>. </p>\n<blockquote><p>The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, who moved to California earlier this year, had been pitching movies and TV plans around Hollywood, Variety previously reported. Under their new, multi-year deal at Netflix, the couple will make documentaries, feature films, scripted television shows and children’s series.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This is interesting, but vague. It kind of checks off every box Netflix has, short of “Zac Efron learns about science from the world’s most patient scientists,” which is <a href=\"https://uproxx.com/tv/zac-efron-netflix-down-to-earth-review-pure-sick-rad/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">admittedly a very specific niche</a>. Let’s get a little more specific. Tell me about some projects that are in development. </p>\n<blockquote><p>The couple will be focused on creating a wide variety of series about stories and issues that are close to their hearts, such as those that their newly formed nonprofit, Archewell, will highlight. Several projects are already in development, including a nature docuseries and an animated series centered on inspirational women.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Cool, cool, nice, nice. All fine and interesting and about what I think we all expected. But just hear me out here, Harry and Megan, if you’re reading this, which as of this moment I’m going to assume you are: A <em>Suits</em> spin-off. Megan Markle reprises her role as Rachel, who now lives in Los Angeles and his split from Mike and is a high-powered entertainment attorney. And, making his acting debut, Harry co-stars as bad boy rival entertainment lawyer Brix Montecarlo. Oh, they start out as hated adversaries (he hates her for being prepared and following the rules and being generally competent; she hates him for playing fast and loose and skirting the consequences), but eventually, baby, the sparks start flying. The tension builds until, finally, it pops like a balloon in a night of unplanned, spontaneous passion… <em>on the eve of the big trial where they are going head-to-head</em>. </p>\n<p>You would watch at least one episode, just out of curiosity, just to see if Harry can act. Please don’t lie to me or yourself about this. </p>\n<h3>ITEM NUMBER FIVE &#8212; Hankso</h3>\n<figure id=\"402464068\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-402464068\" src=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/tom-hanks-feat.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" srcset=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/tom-hanks-feat.jpg 710w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/tom-hanks-feat.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/tom-hanks-feat.jpg?resize=650,366 650w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/tom-hanks-feat.jpg?resize=150,85 150w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/tom-hanks-feat.jpg?resize=328,185 328w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/tom-hanks-feat.jpg?resize=387,218 387w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/tom-hanks-feat.jpg?resize=460,259 460w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/tom-hanks-feat.jpg?resize=196,110 196w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 710px) 100vw, 710px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span class=\"wp-media-credit\">Getty Image</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Tom Hanks is a good man.

Do not look up this last part.</em></p>\n<p>From Amanda:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Saw your excellent <a href=\"https://uproxx.com/movies/great-muppet-caper/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">piece on The Great Muppet Caper</a>, one of the nuttiest kids&#8217; movies ever made. While reading it, I was struck by the similarity between it and 2014&#8217;s &#8220;Muppets Most Wanted,&#8221; a criminally underrated entry in the Muppet canon.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Most Wanted&#8221; borrows a lot of elements from &#8220;Caper&#8221; &#8212; jewel thieves, Piggy being romanced by scoundrel who means her harm, celebrity cameos, etc. But there is one area in which &#8220;Most Wanted&#8221; sets itself apart, and that is with the jaw-dropping musical number &#8220;The Big House.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Here is why &#8220;The Big House&#8221; is one of the greatest sequences to appear on film:<br />\n1. The song is written by the peerless Bret McKenzie, one half of the cherished folk comedy duo Flight of Conchords.<br />\n2. It is literally a song about the Gulag, done in a style that is part light pop, part doo-wop (think Manhattan Transfer).<br />\n3. The lead vocal is performed by Tina Fey. Yes, that Tina Fey, of &#8220;30 Rock&#8221; and &#8220;Mean Girls&#8221; fame. She&#8217;s wearing a Russian military uniform and singing in a Russian accent that comes and goes.<br />\n4. She is backed by a chorus that includes McKenzie&#8217;s fellow Conchord, Jemaine Clement, but also Danny Trejo, Ray Liotta and &#8212; somehow &#8212; Josh Groban.<br />\n5. The lyrics include the following &#8220;This is Russia&#8217;s premier state funded hotel/We&#8217;re very proud of our eclectic clientele/Excellence in service since 1932/Don&#8217;t believe what you read in the online reviews&#8221;</p>\n<p>This performance is absolutely the most insane thing in a movie that also include Salma Hayek being chased by bulls, a dancing Ricky Gervais and Kermit being framed by a look-a-like with a heavy Russian accent.</p>\n<p>The Big House is amazing. I think about it at least once a day, and we just don&#8217;t talk about it enough. Please help me in righting this colossal wrong.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Amanda has sent in a number of emails, all of them good, but this is my favorite one yet. It checks all the boxes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Compliments me in a way that <a href=\"https://uproxx.com/movies/great-muppet-caper/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">allows me to link back</a> to a thing I wrote earlier in the week</li>\n<li>Is informative and comprehensive to a degree that I really don’t have to do any extra thinking beyond block quoting it and doing these lazy bullet points</li>\n<li>Mentions the Muppets</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thank you, Amanda. I will gladly post this video. </p>\n<div class=\"embed-holder\" style=\"--embed-ratio:56.25%;\"><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/tPDfnzCEgaQ?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></div>\n<p>And guess what: We have a second reader email this week. Another good one that I don’t have to elaborate on much. What a lovely development for me and you. </p>\n<p>From AJ:</p>\n<blockquote><p>As a fellow Sixers fan, I feel the current bleakness of watching the NBA playoffs. Here&#8217;s a way I&#8217;ve been enjoying myself: just watch a Miami Heat game and wait for any mention of Duncan Robinson. The announcers always say his full name. Each time they mention him, I just repeat the name in a different vampire voice from What We Do In The Shadows. (&#8220;Get out of here, Duncan Robinson! *hiss*) He shoots like 12 3s a game, so you get a lot of opportunities to practice your various Nandor, Nadia, and Lazlo deliveries. Not so much a question as a suggestion for finding simple joy in these trying times.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Mentioning both my beloved Philadelphia 76ers and my beloved <em>What We Do in the Shadows</em> in the same email is basically a cheat code to get yourself published in this column. And yes, I will be saying “Duncan Robinson” with exactly the same energy as those three say “Colin Robinson,” but worse, because I am incapable of doing accents or impressions. Sometimes I forget this last part and start to do one and I realize one syllable into it what a horrible mistake I’ve made. You’d think I would know by now. </p>\n<p>And yet!</p>\n<h3>AND NOW, THE NEWS</h3>\n<p>To <a title=\"\" href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/airline-pilots-reported-seeing-guy-jetpack-flying-3-000-feet-n1239027\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Los Angeles</a>!</p>\n<blockquote><p>Two pilots on two different flights reported seeing a man in a jetpack thousands of feet in the air above Los Angeles on Sunday, prompting an investigation by authorities.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Hell yes. I love this. I love a good jetpack story. I’m kind of mad we all don’t have jetpacks, to be honest. It’s 2020! Come on! I should be able to fly around with my own personal rocket backpack! Now I&#8217;m angry! Let&#8217;s move on!</p>\n<blockquote><p>An American Airlines pilot was approaching Los Angeles International Airport at around 6:30 p.m. when he called in the sighting to air-traffic control, according to an audio log. The unidentified flying person was at the plane’s altitude, the pilot said, about 3,000 feet in the air.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Damm. I wonder what the pilot said to the tower when he saw some dude in a damn jetpack 3,000 feet in the air. </p>\n<blockquote><p>“Tower, American 1997. We just passed a guy in a jetpack,” the pilot said.</p>\n<p>“Only in LA,” an unidentified person said in the audio log.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This is tremendous. It’s almost exactly like what the pilot and tower guy would say in a movie about a guy who has a jetpack. Screw it, let’s make this movie. Let’s make a jetpack movie. Prince Harry and Megan Markle can star in it as part of their Netflix deal. You know Harry would love to play a jetpack guy.

It turns out the &#8220;member&#8221; is Robert Pattinson (which was initially reported by <a title=\"\" href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2020/09/09/robert-pattinson-the-batman-coronavirus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Vanity Fair</em></a> and confirmed by the <a title=\"\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/03/arts/Robert-Pattinson-Covid-19-Batman.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>New York Times</em></a>), and although the Dark Knight actor is still sidelined, the show (superhero film) must go on. The <em>Daily Mail</em> <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-8697581/Batman-crew-working-round-clock-shoot-without-Robert-Pattinson-amid-covid.html\">reports</a> that <em>The Batman</em> production crew is &#8220;working around the clock&#8221; to film as many scenes as possible without Pattinson, which doesn&#8217;t sound potentially hazardous for everyone involved, nope, not at all:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The Hollywood actor — who is understood to have turned up on set with a temperature &#8211; will have to stay away from filming for 14 days while he recovers and to ensure he doesn’t spread the deadly virus. Amid fears that halting production for two weeks could cost as much as £5 million [over $6 million], the film’s director Matt Reeves is trying to film as much as he can at the Warner Bros. Studio in Leavesden, Hertfordshire, without his leading man.</p>\n<p>Any of the 130-strong crew who did not have direct contact with Pattinson are being asked to return to work.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The irony of the world&#8217;s most famous masked hero testing positive for COVID should not be lost on anyone, but it has been, as &#8220;the United Kingdom industry is confident that crews are observing COVID-19 protocols,&#8221; <a href=\"https://variety.com/2020/film/global/the-batman-resumes-filming-without-robert-pattinson-1234759647/\">according to <em>Variety</em></a>. Adrian Wootton, chief executive of the British Film Commission and Film London, told the publication, &#8220;We’re confident that with all measures in place, any production will resume filming as soon as it’s safe to do so. We also believe this will not impact production overall continuing in U.K., precisely because we have such robust health and safety measures operating, enabling our world-class film and high-end TV sector to get back up and running.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Maybe Batman can work things out with the Riddler over Zoom.</p>\n<p>(Via <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-8697581/Batman-crew-working-round-clock-shoot-without-Robert-Pattinson-amid-covid.html\">the <em>Daily Mail</em></a>)</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?a=qE5xRcr5n-4:op3EurbwyyA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?a=qE5xRcr5n-4:op3EurbwyyA:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?i=qE5xRcr5n-4:op3EurbwyyA:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?a=qE5xRcr5n-4:op3EurbwyyA:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?a=qE5xRcr5n-4:op3EurbwyyA:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?a=qE5xRcr5n-4:op3EurbwyyA:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?i=qE5xRcr5n-4:op3EurbwyyA:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/uproxx/features/~4/qE5xRcr5n-4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 04 Sep 2020 15:05:56 +0000","feedId":6617,"bgimg":"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/batman-robert-pattinson-batsuit.jpg?w=1600&h=660&crop=1","linkMd5":"28f0314b4285863a3971da05ed837c74","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn72@2020_5/2020/09/04/17-11-02-610_ef4890100de0b5f4.webp","destWidth":1600,"destHeight":660,"sourceBytes":63416,"destBytes":63416,"author":"Josh Kurp","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/batman-robert-pattinson-batsuit.jpg?w=1600&h=660&crop=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn72@2020_5/2020/09/04/17-11-02-610_ef4890100de0b5f4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn89@2020_5/2020/09/04/17-11-02-428_c8fa5e32ae89b18f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?i=qE5xRcr5n-4:op3EurbwyyA:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn21@2020_4/2020/09/04/17-11-18-712_9496c6bca663f1b0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn45@2020_2/2020/09/04/17-11-18-942_f1234b5e3acb72a6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?i=qE5xRcr5n-4:op3EurbwyyA:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn97@2020_2/2020/09/04/17-11-22-912_71798e0b68571571.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/uproxx/features/~4/qE5xRcr5n-4":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn62@2020_2/2020/09/04/17-11-22-542_489dda2e4db87dba.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599239462307},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 01:11:02","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 01:11:02","title":"The Best Cheap Whiskey, According To The Masses","link":"https://uproxx.com/?p=402536003","description":"\t<div class=\"featured-image\">\n\t\t<figure class=\"post-thumbnail\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"upx-component upx-image\"><div class=\"image-holder\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"495\" src=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/w-tfeat-uproxx.jpg?w=1600&#38;h=495&#38;crop=1\" class=\"attachment-article-featured size-article-featured skip-lazy\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/w-tfeat-uproxx.jpg 1600w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/w-tfeat-uproxx.jpg?resize=300,93 300w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/w-tfeat-uproxx.jpg?resize=650,201 650w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/w-tfeat-uproxx.jpg?resize=768,238 768w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/w-tfeat-uproxx.jpg?resize=1024,317 1024w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/w-tfeat-uproxx.jpg?resize=1536,475 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) calc(100vw - 20px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 40px), (min-width: 1025px) 1024px, 1024px\" /></div></div><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span class=\"wp-media-credit\">UPROXX</span></figcaption>\t\t</figure>\n\t</div>\n\t<p>Whiskey doesn&#8217;t have to be expensive. In fact, we&#8217;d argue that some of the best whiskey out there is actually very <a href=\"https://uproxx.com/life/bourbons-best-value-for-money/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">affordable</a>. The best cheap whiskey on the shelf generally hits in the $15 to $30 <a href=\"https://uproxx.com/life/best-bottles-of-bourbon-for-under-20/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">range</a> and, more often than not, is full of great flavors. This is especially true of the best <a href=\"https://uproxx.com/life/best-bourbon-under-50/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cheap</a> bourbons since they don&#8217;t have to travel overseas to get to your home bar. </p>\n<p>So, what makes a good cheap whiskey? That&#8217;s simple. Does it taste good to you? Then that&#8217;s enough. Look, you spend $100 on a bottle of whiskey. No one&#8217;s stopping you from doing that. But, for that same $100 bill, you can buy five, maybe even six bottles of perfectly passable every-day-drinking whiskeys. We&#8217;ll let you do the math on that.</p>\n<p>To find out what the masses think are the best cheap whiskeys on the shelf today, we went over to Ranker to see what the people had to say.

Their standard bourbon is a blend of the distillery&#8217;s ten unique mash bills (one high rye, one low rye, and each with five unique yeast strains used). The sip carries the essence of the distillery in the bottle. </p>\n<p><strong>Tasting Notes:</strong></p>\n<p>We luckily just got to taste this one live. <a title=\"\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CEcer6bld0P/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Check it out here</a>. This is a light and fruity bourbon up top. That sweet fruit carries through with hints of classic bourbon vanilla and a touch of oak.

The juice is a classic mix of corn, rye, and malted barley that&#8217;s aged for four years before blending, cutting down to proof, and bottling. </p>\n<p><strong>Tasting Notes:</strong></p>\n<p>Caramel, corn, vanilla, and fruit lead the way. The bourbon is classic for a reason after all. The sip is touched by an echo of oak as the vanilla and caramel take center stage. There&#8217;s a mild spice with a fairground caramel corn sweetness on the short end. </p>\n<p><strong>Bottom Line:</strong></p>\n<p>Mix it, shoot it, drink it on the rocks. </p>\n<h3>8. Jack Daniel&#8217;s</h3>\n<figure id=\"402536010\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-402536010\" src=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/jack-daniels-tennessee-whiskey.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"473\" srcset=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/jack-daniels-tennessee-whiskey.jpg 473w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/jack-daniels-tennessee-whiskey.jpg?resize=300,634 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 473px) 100vw, 473px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span class=\"wp-media-credit\">Jack Daniel</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p><strong>ABV:</strong> 40%<br />\n<strong>Distillery:</strong> Jack Daniel&#8217;s Distillery, Lynchburg, TN (Brown-Forman)<br />\n<strong>Average Price:</strong> <a title=\"\" href=\"https://drizly.com/liquor/whiskey/bourbon/jack-daniels-old-no-7-tennessee-whiskey/p5019\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">$25</a></p>\n<p><strong>The Whiskey:</strong></p>\n<p>Jack Daniel&#8217;s Tennessee Whiskey is another stone-cold classic. Frank Sinatra was buried with the stuff because he loved it so much. Rock stars have been swigging from bottles of Jack since there were rock stars. The Tennessee whiskey has an extra layer of refinement thanks to the Lincoln County Process of sugar maple charcoal filtration, making it a bit more refined than a standard Kentucky bourbon. </p>\n<p><strong>Tasting Notes:</strong></p>\n<p>Banana and oak greet you. Vanilla arrives next with a hint of dark spice and little tart apple. The banana is ever-present as the oak, spice, and vanilla fades away semi-slowly. </p>\n<p><strong>Bottom Line:</strong></p>\n<p>This is Jack Daniel&#8217;s, no one can tell you how to drink your JD. </p>\n<h3>7. Crown Royal</h3>\n<figure id=\"402536008\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-402536008\" src=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/crown-royal-diageo.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"370\" srcset=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/crown-royal-diageo.jpg 370w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/crown-royal-diageo.jpg?resize=300,300 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 370px) 100vw, 370px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span class=\"wp-media-credit\">Crown Royal</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p><strong>ABV:</strong> 40%<br />\n<strong>Distillery:</strong> Crown Royal Distillery, Gimli, MB (Diageo)<br />\n<strong>Average Price:</strong> <a title=\"\" href=\"https://drizly.com/liquor/whiskey/canadian-whisky/crown-royal-fine-deluxe-blended-canadian-whisky/p2873\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">$28</a></p>\n<p><strong>The Whiskey:</strong></p>\n<p>This iconic Canadian whisky is a powerhouse. The juice is a blend of 50 different whiskies with varying grain mash bills, aging times, and even oak it&#8217;s aged in. The result is a focused look at what Canadian whisky can be when blended just right. </p>\n<p><strong>Tasting Notes:</strong></p>\n<p>Maple syrup, oak, and vanilla mingle upfront. The syrup leans into grape pancake syrup territory as mild hints of powdery spices ping throughout the taste. The end is short, full of oak and fruit, and satisfying. </p>\n<p><strong>Bottom Line:</strong></p>\n<p>This works well as a highball or as a cocktail base. </p>\n<h3>6. Knob Creek</h3>\n<figure id=\"402536013\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-402536013\" src=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/knob-creek.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" srcset=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/knob-creek.jpg 400w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/knob-creek.jpg?resize=300,450 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span class=\"wp-media-credit\">Knob Creek</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p><strong>ABV:</strong> 50%<br />\n<strong>Distillery:</strong> Jim Beam Distillery, Clermont, KY (Beam Suntory)<br />\n<strong>Average Price:</strong> <a title=\"\" href=\"https://drizly.com/liquor/whiskey/bourbon/knob-creek-kentucky-straight-bourbon-whiskey/p1193\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">$35</a></p>\n<p><strong>The Whiskey:</strong></p>\n<p>Jim Beam spread its wings a bit back in the early 1990s with their Small Batch Collection. This &#8212; along with Basil Hayden, Booker&#8217;s, and Baker&#8217;s &#8212; helped reinvigorate the brand. The juice in the bottle is small-batched from barrels that average nine-years in age. </p>\n<p><strong>Tasting Notes:</strong></p>\n<p>Classic bourbon vanilla is present alongside hints of worn leather, buttermilk biscuit dripping with honey, and a sprinkling of orange zest. The peppery spice is a nice accent for the caramel corn bourbon-y aspect with a bit of tart apple crispness. The oak and spice linger the longest as the sip fades away while warming you up. </p>\n<p><strong>Bottom Line:</strong></p>\n<p>This is perfectly suited for a highball or over the rocks. But don&#8217;t sleep on using it in a Manhattan either. </p>\n<h3>5. Jameson</h3>\n<figure id=\"402536011\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-402536011\" src=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/jameson.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"414\" srcset=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/jameson.jpeg 414w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/jameson.jpeg?resize=300,300 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 414px) 100vw, 414px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span class=\"wp-media-credit\">Jameson</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p><strong>ABV:</strong> 40%<br />\n<strong>Distillery:</strong> New Midleton Distillery, County Cork<br />\n<strong>Average Price:</strong> <a title=\"\" href=\"https://drizly.com/liquor/whiskey/irish-whiskey/jameson-irish-whiskey/p5138\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">$30</a></p>\n<p><strong>The Whiskey:</strong></p>\n<p>You kind of can&#8217;t go wrong with a bottle of Jameson on the shelf. The Irish tipple is a blend of pot still and grain whiskeys that are aged in ex-bourbon and ex-sherry casks for varying amounts of time. The final result is a workhorse whiskey that works in any application. </p>\n<p><strong>Tasting Notes:</strong></p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a grassiness that leads toward a honey sweetness and apple tartness. Expect a hint of nuttiness next to the grass as citrus notes kick in next to a dusting of cinnamon. The oak, spice, fruit, and grassiness fade away fairly quickly, leaving you wanting another sip. </p>\n<p><strong>Bottom Line:</strong></p>\n<p>Jameson and ginger with a lime twist is a classic. But, this one also works fine in a highball or on the rocks in a pinch. </p>\n<h3>4.

The mash has a fair amount of rye in there, adding texture and depth. The juice is aged for around six to eight years before blending and being brought down to the unique 81 proof. </p>\n<p><strong>Tasting Notes:</strong></p>\n<p>Stone fruit, popped corn, and vanilla open this one up. There&#8217;s a mix of Christmas spices next to apple pie with a nice, buttery crust. The sharp spices and mild oak carry the sip to a velvety end with more of the sweet corn and fruit lasting until the last moment. </p>\n<p><strong>Bottom Line:</strong></p>\n<p>Use this in your next old fashioned, Sazerac, or boulevardier. </p>\n<h3>3. Evan Williams</h3>\n<figure id=\"402536015\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-402536015\" src=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mob-evan-williams-bg.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" srcset=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mob-evan-williams-bg.jpg 640w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mob-evan-williams-bg.jpg?resize=300,422 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span class=\"wp-media-credit\">Evan Williams</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p><strong>ABV:</strong> 43%<br />\n<strong>Distillery:</strong> Heaven Hill Distillery, Louisville, KY<br />\n<strong>Average Price:</strong> <a title=\"\" href=\"https://drizly.com/liquor/whiskey/bourbon/evan-williams-bourbon/p3248\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">$15</a></p>\n<p><strong>The Whiskey:</strong></p>\n<p>This label has gained massive popularity since it became the go-to rail bourbon at many a bar around the nation. The classic juice is aged between four and seven years before it&#8217;s blended, cut to proof, and then bottled. </p>\n<p><strong>Tasting Notes:</strong></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s kind of like walking through a fairground and smelling the kettle corn popping and the caramel apples drying in the sun. The tartness of the apples mingles with the sweetness of the caramel with hints of vanilla, oak, and spice peeking in. The warm end fades quickly with a slight sweetness lingering. </p>\n<p><strong>Bottom Line:</strong></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s the perfect beer back shot or mixer with cola, ginger, or whatever you dig. </p>\n<h3>2. Buffalo Trace</h3>\n<figure id=\"402536007\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-402536007\" src=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/buffalo-trace.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"596\" srcset=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/buffalo-trace.jpg 596w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/buffalo-trace.jpg?resize=300,182 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 596px) 100vw, 596px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span class=\"wp-media-credit\">Buffalo Trace </span></figcaption></figure>\n<p><strong>ABV:</strong> 45%<br />\n<strong>Distillery:</strong> Buffalo Trace Distillery, Frankfort, KY (Sazerac)<br />\n<strong>Average Price:</strong> <a title=\"\" href=\"https://drizly.com/liquor/whiskey/bourbon/buffalo-trace-bourbon/p2260\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">$30</a></p>\n<p><strong>The Whiskey:</strong></p>\n<p>Buffalo Trace is an award-winning bourbon from one of the biggest distilleries in Kentucky right now. This bottle was crafted to be an example of the great work Buffalo Trace does with its premier brands. The low-rye mash bill leans into the softness of the Kentucky limestone water the region is famous for. </p>\n<p><strong>Tasting Notes:</strong></p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a crafted feel to this sip as vanilla and molasses dance up top with a hint of fresh mint. Rich and buttery toffee mingles with hints of mild spice, dark berries, and plenty of oak. The sip&#8217;s softness takes hold as the oak, fruit, and spice fade, leaving you with a warming sense of comfort. </p>\n<p><strong>Bottom Line:</strong></p>\n<p>Use it however you see fit. </p>\n<h3>1. Maker&#8217;s Mark</h3>\n<figure id=\"402536014\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-402536014\" src=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Makers_Mark_Bottle_wWindow_1300x1733.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" srcset=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Makers_Mark_Bottle_wWindow_1300x1733.jpg 600w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Makers_Mark_Bottle_wWindow_1300x1733.jpg?resize=300,400 300w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Makers_Mark_Bottle_wWindow_1300x1733.jpg?resize=414,552 414w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Makers_Mark_Bottle_wWindow_1300x1733.jpg?resize=354,472 354w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span class=\"wp-media-credit\">Maker</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p><strong>ABV:</strong> 45%<br />\n<strong>Distillery:</strong> Maker&#8217;s Mark Distillery, Loretto, KY (Beam Suntory)<br />\n<strong>Average Price:</strong> <a title=\"\" href=\"https://drizly.com/liquor/whiskey/bourbon/makers-mark-bourbon-whisky/p1254\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">$30</a></p>\n<p><strong>The Whiskey:</strong></p>\n<p>This is another classic Kentucky bourbon that leans into the world of wheated bourbons. The mash bill chucks the usual rye and replaces it with red winter wheat. The juice is then aged for six to seven years and then blended, cut down to proof, and then bottled before the famous red wax seal is applied. </p>\n<p><strong>Tasting Notes:</strong></p>\n<p>Crème brûlée cut with pods of vanilla beans rings loudest with a sense of dark spices drawing you in. There&#8217;s a crusty bread flourish that counterpoints the rich and velvety vanilla pudding edge. The sip lingers with a mild spice, a bit of oak, and a wisp of fresh mint as it slowly fades away. </p>\n<p><strong>Bottom Line:</strong></p>\n<p>This is the perfect cocktail base that works on the rocks or in a highball just as well.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?a=rBjVSRT4S3Y:DwIJWQD2KwY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?a=rBjVSRT4S3Y:DwIJWQD2KwY:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?i=rBjVSRT4S3Y:DwIJWQD2KwY:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?a=rBjVSRT4S3Y:DwIJWQD2KwY:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?a=rBjVSRT4S3Y:DwIJWQD2KwY:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?a=rBjVSRT4S3Y:DwIJWQD2KwY:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?i=rBjVSRT4S3Y:DwIJWQD2KwY:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/uproxx/features/~4/rBjVSRT4S3Y\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 03 Sep 2020 21:00:00 +0000","feedId":6617,"bgimg":"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/w-tfeat-uproxx.jpg?w=1600&h=495&crop=1","linkMd5":"54f99a9e68123fff7e6f170a17f6bb03","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn94@2020_6/2020/09/04/17-11-02-811_b7fee1e0ecbd66a9.webp","destWidth":1600,"destHeight":495,"sourceBytes":474432,"destBytes":474432,"author":"Zachary Johnston","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/w-tfeat-uproxx.jpg?w=1600&h=495&crop=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn94@2020_6/2020/09/04/17-11-02-811_b7fee1e0ecbd66a9.webp","https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/four-roses.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn40@2020_2/2020/09/04/17-11-15-500_12ae8c81f289140a.webp","https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/jim-beam.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn40@2020_6/2020/09/04/17-11-17-997_ef8858b089fffad4.webp","https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/jack-daniels-tennessee-whiskey.jpg":null,"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/crown-royal-diageo.jpg":null,"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/knob-creek.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn90@2020_5/2020/09/04/17-11-15-439_6c5710ddfd82a3b1.webp","https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/jameson.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn79@2020_6/2020/09/04/17-11-20-604_32656ccdfa6f09c5.webp","https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/wild-turkey-whisky-exchange.jpg":null,"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mob-evan-williams-bg.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn30@2020_5/2020/09/04/17-11-23-081_cddb1b4620f1afc6.webp","https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/buffalo-trace.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn3@2020_5/2020/09/04/17-11-20-658_eaf293b5e136ea35.webp","https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Makers_Mark_Bottle_wWindow_1300x1733.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn42@2020_3/2020/09/04/17-11-20-311_db8ce209941a0fd1.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn89@2020_5/2020/09/04/17-11-02-428_c8fa5e32ae89b18f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?i=rBjVSRT4S3Y:DwIJWQD2KwY:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn47@2020_5/2020/09/04/17-11-15-462_e17f16c17b356b07.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn45@2020_2/2020/09/04/17-11-18-942_f1234b5e3acb72a6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?i=rBjVSRT4S3Y:DwIJWQD2KwY:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn13@2020_5/2020/09/04/17-11-21-621_63fb35c85b88912f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/uproxx/features/~4/rBjVSRT4S3Y":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn90@2020_1/2020/09/04/17-11-21-229_1ddc0cb59feff162.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599239462320},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 01:11:02","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 01:11:02","title":"James Bond Meets A New 00 Agent And Kills Bad Guys With Ana De Armas In The ‘No Time To Die’ Trailer","link":"https://uproxx.com/?p=402536025","description":"<div class=\"upx-component upx-embed-url\"><div class=\"embed-holder\"><iframe src=\"//youtube.com/embed/vw2FOYjCz38\" allow=\"accelerometer;

His peace is short-lived when his old friend Felix Leiter from the CIA turns up asking for help. The mission to rescue a kidnapped scientist turns out to be far more treacherous than expected, leading Bond onto the trail of a mysterious villain armed with dangerous new technology.</p></blockquote>\n<p><em>No Time to Die</em>, which also stars Léa Seydoux, Naomie Harris, Jeffrey Wright, Christoph Waltz, Rory Kinnear, Ralph Fiennes, and Billy Magnussen, opens on November 20.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?a=tMLbUrb2ih0:Ola8KIGUQoc:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?a=tMLbUrb2ih0:Ola8KIGUQoc:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?i=tMLbUrb2ih0:Ola8KIGUQoc:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?a=tMLbUrb2ih0:Ola8KIGUQoc:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?a=tMLbUrb2ih0:Ola8KIGUQoc:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?a=tMLbUrb2ih0:Ola8KIGUQoc:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?i=tMLbUrb2ih0:Ola8KIGUQoc:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/uproxx/features/~4/tMLbUrb2ih0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 03 Sep 2020 12:39:30 +0000","feedId":6617,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=qj6IDK7rITs","linkMd5":"005240a9b60b3a77a7cc9910c9a76f6e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn89@2020_5/2020/09/04/17-11-02-428_c8fa5e32ae89b18f.webp","destWidth":113,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":1072,"destBytes":460,"author":"Josh Kurp","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn89@2020_5/2020/09/04/17-11-02-428_c8fa5e32ae89b18f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?i=tMLbUrb2ih0:Ola8KIGUQoc:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn56@2020_5/2020/09/04/17-11-17-964_f74745b78b387b8b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn45@2020_2/2020/09/04/17-11-18-942_f1234b5e3acb72a6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?i=tMLbUrb2ih0:Ola8KIGUQoc:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn27@2020_3/2020/09/04/17-11-15-546_36d99f2fa41e000c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/uproxx/features/~4/tMLbUrb2ih0":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn14@2020_5/2020/09/04/17-11-22-264_9b0d60b9437ff661.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599239462314},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 01:11:02","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 01:11:02","title":"Chadwick Boseman’s Hometown Is Building A Statue To Honor The ‘Black Panther’ Actor","link":"https://uproxx.com/?p=402537772","description":"\t<div class=\"featured-image\">\n\t\t<figure class=\"post-thumbnail\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"upx-component upx-image\"><div class=\"image-holder\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"660\" src=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/black-panther-chadwick.jpg?w=1600&#38;h=660&#38;crop=1\" class=\"attachment-article-featured size-article-featured skip-lazy\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/black-panther-chadwick.jpg?resize=1200,495 1200w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/black-panther-chadwick.jpg?resize=1600,660 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) calc(100vw - 20px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 40px), (min-width: 1025px) 1024px, 1024px\" /></div></div><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span class=\"wp-media-credit\">Getty Image</span></figcaption>\t\t</figure>\n\t</div>\n\t<p>The <a href=\"https://uproxx.com/movies/chadwick-boseman-replace-confederate-statue/\">Confederate monument is unfortunately staying (for now)</a>, but Chadwick Boseman is getting his statue. </p>\n<p>In the days following the <a href=\"https://uproxx.com/movies/chadwick-boseman-dead/\"><em>Black Panther</em> star&#8217;s death</a>, a <a href=\"https://uproxx.com/movies/chadwick-boseman-replace-confederate-statue/\">petition was created</a> to honor Boseman&#8217;s impact by erecting a statue in his hometown of Anderson, South Carolina. &#8220;Upon the release of his film <em>Black Panther</em>, Mr. Boseman took it upon himself to rent out a theatre in his home town of Anderson South Carolina to show the film for free. So that young boys and girls could be inspired by the film without the financial barrier. Mr. Boseman is without question an American treasure and his accolades go on and on,&#8221; it read. &#8220;It is only fitting that his work is honored in the same place that birthed him.&#8221;</p>\n<p><em>TMZ</em> <a href=\"https://www.tmz.com/2020/09/03/chadwick-boseman-hometown-honor-statue-tribute/\">contacted</a> Mayor Terence Roberts&#8217; office in Anderson and was told that &#8220;the city is enthusiastically working on a permanent public tribute to honor the late actor. We&#8217;re told the City has already contacted an artist and they&#8217;re brainstorming ideas on how best to honor the hometown hero who played legendary roles. We&#8217;re told the statue will include a mix of sculpture with mural and/or art elements.&#8221; As for tearing down the city&#8217;s shameful Confederate monument, that&#8217;s not the mayor&#8217;s call — it&#8217;s protected by the state&#8217;s Heritage Act, <a href=\"https://www.independentmail.com/story/news/local/2017/08/14/s-c-law-protects-confederate-monuments/566472001/\">which</a> &#8220;states that no historical monument can altered or moved without a two-thirds vote in both chambers of the General Assembly.&#8221;</p>\n<p>A screening of Black Panther was held on Thursday night in Anderson, where one resident <a href=\"https://www.independentmail.com/story/news/2020/09/04/chadwick-boseman-honored-anderson-public-ceremony-hometown-native-black-panther/5709330002/\">told the <em>Independent Mail</em></a>, &#8220;I have been crying, crying, crying.

In it, he says that he and his wife, Lauren, and two of their three daughters, Jasmine, 4, and Tiana, 2, all came back with positive results. Mind you, this isn’t news: Johnson claims the disease has come and gone, and that they’re all “no longer contagious.”</p>\n<p>Still, he wanted to warn people about “one of the most challenging and difficult” ordeals he and his family have ever gone through.</p>\n<p>“Testing positive for COVID-19 is a lot different than recovering from nasty injuries, getting evicted or being broke, which I’ve been more than a few times,” he said. “My No. 1 priority is to always protect my family and my loved ones … I wish it was only me that tested positive. It was my entire family and it was a kick in the gut. We as a family are good, we’re on the other end of it and no longer contagious. Thank God, we’re healthy.”</p>\n<p>He continued:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“We are counting our blessings right now. We are well aware you don’t always get to the other end of COVID-19 stronger and healthier. I have had some of my best friends lose their parents to this virus that is so incredibly relentless and unforgiving. We are counting our blessings, but we are good.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Alongside the video, Johnson posted an encouraging message:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Stay disciplined.<br />\nBoost your immune system.<br />\nCommit to wellness.<br />\nWear your mask.<br />\nProtect your family.<br />\nBe strict about having people over your house or gatherings.<br />\nStay positive.<br />\nAnd care for your fellow human beings.</p>\n<p>Stay healthy, my friends.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Glad to hear you and your family are doing better, Mr. Johnson.</p>\n<p>(Via <em><a href=\"https://ew.com/celebrity/the-rock-family-tested-positive-coronavirus/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">EW</a></em>)</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?a=fZ8eJRZKxwY:yWSiLGxF4o4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?a=fZ8eJRZKxwY:yWSiLGxF4o4:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?i=fZ8eJRZKxwY:yWSiLGxF4o4:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?a=fZ8eJRZKxwY:yWSiLGxF4o4:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?a=fZ8eJRZKxwY:yWSiLGxF4o4:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?a=fZ8eJRZKxwY:yWSiLGxF4o4:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?i=fZ8eJRZKxwY:yWSiLGxF4o4:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/uproxx/features/~4/fZ8eJRZKxwY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 03 Sep 2020 01:22:50 +0000","feedId":6617,"bgimg":"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/therockdwaynejohnson1024.jpg?w=1024&h=501&crop=1","linkMd5":"d3ea3f373be61710f4ecb0fbca1e8d51","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn62@2020_2/2020/09/04/17-11-02-586_65eda10c40edb348.webp","destWidth":1024,"destHeight":501,"sourceBytes":39782,"destBytes":39782,"author":"matthewprigge","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/therockdwaynejohnson1024.jpg?w=1024&h=501&crop=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn62@2020_2/2020/09/04/17-11-02-586_65eda10c40edb348.webp","https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/1f5a4.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn37@2020_4/2020/09/04/17-11-21-031_fb5f03c7cb610e5b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn89@2020_5/2020/09/04/17-11-02-428_c8fa5e32ae89b18f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?i=fZ8eJRZKxwY:yWSiLGxF4o4:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn9@2020_3/2020/09/04/17-11-22-204_dad6003b2e89d124.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn45@2020_2/2020/09/04/17-11-18-942_f1234b5e3acb72a6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?i=fZ8eJRZKxwY:yWSiLGxF4o4:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn42@2020_3/2020/09/04/17-11-18-988_3127b0cea385ba1e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/uproxx/features/~4/fZ8eJRZKxwY":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn26@2020_1/2020/09/04/17-11-20-068_a85b3a534b0d3f8f.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599239462315},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 01:11:02","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 01:11:02","title":"Report: Chadwick Boseman Was Convinced He Would Beat Cancer And Regain Weight For The ‘Black Panther’ Sequel To Film In 2021","link":"https://uproxx.com/?p=402534980","description":"\t<div class=\"featured-image\">\n\t\t<figure class=\"post-thumbnail\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"upx-component upx-image\"><div class=\"image-holder\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/chadwick-boseman.jpg?w=1024&#38;h=450&#38;crop=1\" class=\"attachment-article-featured size-article-featured skip-lazy\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/chadwick-boseman.jpg 1024w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/chadwick-boseman.jpg?resize=300,132 300w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/chadwick-boseman.jpg?resize=650,286 650w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/chadwick-boseman.jpg?resize=768,338 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) calc(100vw -

The <em>Black Panther</em> star shielded virtually everyone from news of his Stage 3 diagnosis in 2016 &#8212; the same year he first appeared as the MCU&#8217;s T&#8217;Challa in <em>Captain America: Civil War</em>, all the way <a title=\"\" href=\"https://uproxx.com/movies/chadwick-boseman-black-panther-superhero-jackie-robinson-thurgood-marshall-james-brown/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">though <em>Avengers: Endgame</em></a>. A new report from the <em>Hollywood Reporter</em> reveals that even Marvel Chief Kevin Feige had <a title=\"\" href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/disney-grapples-with-how-to-proceed-on-black-panther-without-chadwick-boseman\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">no idea</a> that Boseman was ill, and of course, people are now wondering what this all means for <em>Black Panther 2</em> (due to arrive in May 2022).</p>\n<p>According to the report, Boseman (who suffered from Stage 4 colon cancer with noticeable weight loss this year) fully <a title=\"\" href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/disney-grapples-with-how-to-proceed-on-black-panther-without-chadwick-boseman\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">believed</a> &#8220;until about a week before his death that he was going to beat cancer and would be able to gain the weight back.&#8221; He hoped to do so prior to <em>Black Panther 2</em>&#8216;s planned filming date in March 2021. Boseman also wished to start training for the sequel in September, but then his health took a turn for the worse. Here&#8217;s more about Boseman&#8217;s desire to keep his condition <a title=\"\" href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/disney-grapples-with-how-to-proceed-on-black-panther-without-chadwick-boseman\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">under wraps</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Only a handful of non-family members knew that Boseman was sick, including producing partner Logan Coles, longtime agent Michael Greene, trainer Addison Henderson and 42 director Brian Helgeland &#8212; with varying degrees of knowledge about the severity of the actor’s condition. No one involved with Black Panther was aware, says a source. It was Boseman’s wish to keep his cancer battle private.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Given that Boseman was so beloved in the King T&#8217;Challa role (he was also <a title=\"\" href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/30/us/chadwick-boseman-children-cancer-trnd/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">heroic offscreen</a> as well as in his other <a title=\"\" href=\"https://uproxx.com/movies/chadwick-boseman-black-panther-superhero-jackie-robinson-thurgood-marshall-james-brown/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cinematic endeavors</a>), there&#8217;s little reason to believe that Marvel Studios and Disney would dream of having another actor portray T&#8217;Challa in a sequel to the 2018 movie that grossed over $1 billion. </p>\n<p><em>Hollywood Reporter</em> discusses that point, as well as an option that might be feasible: to have Letitia Wright&#8217;s Shuri, sister of T&#8217;Challa become the new Black Panther. It&#8217;s an idea that will probably find (bittersweet) audience support, especially considering that <a title=\"\" href=\"https://uproxx.com/hitfix/funniest-best-tweets-avengersendgame-trailer-where-is-shuri/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fans panicked</a> while worrying whether Shuri would survive the snap. The idea of Shuri becoming the new Black Panther also <a title=\"\" href=\"https://www.marvel.com/articles/comics/the-first-time-shuri-became-the-black-panther\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">slides into comic-book lore</a>, so surely, Feige and the rest of Marvel Studios will tie up all the proper knots if they decide to make it happen.</p>\n<p>(Via <a title=\"\" href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/disney-grapples-with-how-to-proceed-on-black-panther-without-chadwick-boseman\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Hollywood Reporter</em></a>)</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?a=-BGDg40x9KI:QlK1VWJEeA8:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?a=-BGDg40x9KI:QlK1VWJEeA8:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?i=-BGDg40x9KI:QlK1VWJEeA8:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?a=-BGDg40x9KI:QlK1VWJEeA8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?a=-BGDg40x9KI:QlK1VWJEeA8:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?a=-BGDg40x9KI:QlK1VWJEeA8:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?i=-BGDg40x9KI:QlK1VWJEeA8:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/uproxx/features/~4/-BGDg40x9KI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Sep 2020 18:01:16 +0000","feedId":6617,"bgimg":"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/chadwick-boseman.jpg?w=1024&h=450&crop=1","linkMd5":"dc82b87e9dafaaeed4c61f9f5a126545","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn62@2020_1/2020/09/04/17-11-02-587_bf92a6c1cfcd4d5b.webp","destWidth":1024,"destHeight":450,"sourceBytes":79836,"destBytes":79836,"author":"Kimberly Ricci","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/chadwick-boseman.jpg?w=1024&h=450&crop=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn62@2020_1/2020/09/04/17-11-02-587_bf92a6c1cfcd4d5b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn89@2020_5/2020/09/04/17-11-02-428_c8fa5e32ae89b18f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?i=-BGDg40x9KI:QlK1VWJEeA8:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn23@2020_3/2020/09/04/17-11-20-823_d22f5085c61f69a0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn45@2020_2/2020/09/04/17-11-18-942_f1234b5e3acb72a6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?i=-BGDg40x9KI:QlK1VWJEeA8:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn95@2020_4/2020/09/04/17-11-20-597_c801785e795accac.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/uproxx/features/~4/-BGDg40x9KI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn2@2020_1/2020/09/04/17-11-21-484_c462df8336be9563.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599239462317},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 01:11:02","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 01:11:02","title":"Zack Snyder’s ‘Army of the Dead’ Is Already Getting A Netflix Prequel And Anime Spinoff","link":"https://uproxx.com/?p=402537350","description":"\t<div class=\"featured-image\">\n\t\t<figure class=\"post-thumbnail\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"upx-component upx-image\"><div class=\"image-holder\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"497\" src=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/zacksnyderarmyofthedead1024.jpg?w=1024&#38;h=497&#38;crop=1\" class=\"attachment-article-featured size-article-featured skip-lazy\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/zacksnyderarmyofthedead1024.jpg 1024w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/zacksnyderarmyofthedead1024.jpg?resize=300,146 300w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/zacksnyderarmyofthedead1024.jpg?resize=650,315 650w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/zacksnyderarmyofthedead1024.jpg?resize=768,373 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) calc(100vw - 20px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 40px), (min-width: 1025px) 1024px, 1024px\" /></div></div><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span class=\"wp-media-credit\">Zack Snyder on Twitter</span></figcaption>\t\t</figure>\n\t</div>\n\t<p>We haven&#8217;t seen Zack Snyder&#8217;s <em>Army of the Dead</em> on Netflix just yet, but the Dawn of the Dead sequel is apparently getting its own extended universe on Netflix. Snyder&#8217;s Army of the Dead isn&#8217;t even out yet, as the movie still requires reshoots after it was announced that <a href=\"https://uproxx.com/movies/tig-notaro-replacing-chris-delia-zack-snyder-army-of-the-dead/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tig Notaro would fill a role meant for Zack D&#8217;Elia</a> following a series of sexual misconduct allegations against the actor and standup. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/zack-snyders-army-of-the-dead-prequel-and-anime-series-in-the-works\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">But according to a story in The Hollywood Reporter</a>, Snyder&#8217;s non-Justice League playground is getting a lot bigger, with an anime and sequel already signed up for by the streaming giant well before the zombie heist film gets an audience on Netflix.</p>\n<p>The spinoff movie won&#8217;t feature Snyder directing the project, but he will produce it. Interestingly, an actor in the Army Of The Dead film, Matthias Schweighöfer, will direct the movie that will feature on his Ludwig Dieter. According to THR, the movie will film in Germany. As far as the animated series, it will take place in Las Vegas — or what&#8217;s left of it — and focus more on Bautista&#8217;s origin story. </p>\n<blockquote><p>The anime series, Army of the Dead: Lost Vegas, will chronicles the origin story of Bautista’s character and his rescue crew during the initial fall of Vegas as they confront the mysterious source of the zombie outbreak.</p>\n<p>Snyder will direct two episodes of the anime series while Jay Oliva, who has directed numerous movies for DC Comics’ animated line and was a storyboard artist for Dead, will act as showrunner and also direct two episodes of the series. Bautista, Ana de la Reguera, Tig Notaro, Omari Hardwick and Ella Purnell will reprise their roles in the anime series.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The original script of <em>Army of the Dead</em> was apparently pretty gruesome, so maybe that will appear in some of the other properties Netflix is cooking up now.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?a=E0x9QhU3eAA:v0HAzJ5P99Y:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?a=E0x9QhU3eAA:v0HAzJ5P99Y:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?i=E0x9QhU3eAA:v0HAzJ5P99Y:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?a=E0x9QhU3eAA:v0HAzJ5P99Y:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?a=E0x9QhU3eAA:v0HAzJ5P99Y:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?a=E0x9QhU3eAA:v0HAzJ5P99Y:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?i=E0x9QhU3eAA:v0HAzJ5P99Y:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/uproxx/features/~4/E0x9QhU3eAA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 04 Sep 2020 03:13:42 +0000","feedId":6617,"bgimg":"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/zacksnyderarmyofthedead1024.jpg?w=1024&h=497&crop=1","linkMd5":"5e25eb4e6df1cfac72bf1c21b3aba908","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn64@2020_4/2020/09/04/17-11-02-548_d378e39a381792f3.webp","destWidth":1024,"destHeight":497,"sourceBytes":82900,"destBytes":82900,"author":"Ryan Nagelhout","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/zacksnyderarmyofthedead1024.jpg?w=1024&h=497&crop=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn64@2020_4/2020/09/04/17-11-02-548_d378e39a381792f3.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn89@2020_5/2020/09/04/17-11-02-428_c8fa5e32ae89b18f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?i=E0x9QhU3eAA:v0HAzJ5P99Y:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn57@2020_3/2020/09/04/17-11-22-650_8cbf556830ff2cd2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn45@2020_2/2020/09/04/17-11-18-942_f1234b5e3acb72a6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?i=E0x9QhU3eAA:v0HAzJ5P99Y:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn59@2020_3/2020/09/04/17-11-15-533_919cd1534ac23662.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/uproxx/features/~4/E0x9QhU3eAA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn10@2020_5/2020/09/04/17-11-19-243_076a5887ad8e28fc.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599239462308},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 01:11:02","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 01:11:02","title":"Denis Villeneuve Wanted To Direct ‘Dune’ After Feeling Only ‘Half Satisfied’ With David Lynch’s Adaptation","link":"https://uproxx.com/?p=402534680","description":"\t<div class=\"featured-image\">\n\t\t<figure class=\"post-thumbnail\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"upx-component upx-image\"><div class=\"image-holder\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/dune-timothee-chalamet-top.jpg?w=1024&#38;h=450&#38;crop=1\" class=\"attachment-article-featured size-article-featured skip-lazy\" alt=\"dune timothee chalamet\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/dune-timothee-chalamet-top.jpg 1024w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/dune-timothee-chalamet-top.jpg?resize=300,132 300w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/dune-timothee-chalamet-top.jpg?resize=650,286 650w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/dune-timothee-chalamet-top.jpg?resize=768,338 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) calc(100vw - 20px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 40px), (min-width: 1025px) 1024px, 1024px\" /></div></div><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span class=\"wp-media-credit\">Warner Bros.</span></figcaption>\t\t</figure>\n\t</div>\n\t<p><em>Dune</em> (1984) is a confounding, often-incomprehensible movie, which is to say, it&#8217;s a David Lynch movie.

Nearly nine months after moving to Los Angeles and <a href=\"https://uproxx.com/tv/prince-harry-meghan-markle-hollywood-project/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">quietly shopping around ideas</a>, the two have finally made it: <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/02/business/media/harry-meghan-netflix.html?smid=tw-share\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">As per<em> The New York Times</em></a>, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have inked a massive deal with Netflix.</p>\n<p>When it was first reported that the two semi-ex-royals were pitching around Hollywood, it was believed they were touting some mysterious TV project. Now we know that they were far more ambitious. Their Netflix deal which will include not only TV, but also movies, documentaries, even children’s programming. There are currently no details on what any of these individual projects will entail, but perhaps a revival of Markle’s old TV show <em>Suits</em> is on the docket?</p>\n<p>When Prince Andrew and his Los Angeles-born wife left England, the portmanteau-loving press and social media dubbed it “Megxit.” Their reasons for relocating may have been less amusing; Markle was routinely attacked and condescended to by the British press, who weren’t above making comments about her being mixed-race. Markle is an outspoken feminist and Prince Andrew often champions progressive platforms, including environmentalism, so that may give you some idea of the many things they’ll be bringing to Netflix in the not-so-distant future.</p>\n<p>(Via <em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/02/business/media/harry-meghan-netflix.html?smid=tw-share\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">NYT</a></em>)</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?a=RudkLd7jNNI:ATSzJNGTV-I:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?a=RudkLd7jNNI:ATSzJNGTV-I:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?i=RudkLd7jNNI:ATSzJNGTV-I:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?a=RudkLd7jNNI:ATSzJNGTV-I:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?a=RudkLd7jNNI:ATSzJNGTV-I:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?a=RudkLd7jNNI:ATSzJNGTV-I:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?i=RudkLd7jNNI:ATSzJNGTV-I:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/uproxx/features/~4/RudkLd7jNNI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Sep 2020 22:38:41 +0000","feedId":6617,"bgimg":"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/harry-meghan-markle-wide.jpeg?w=1024&h=448&crop=1","linkMd5":"68c81f9f34db9f7f6faa3a808df1b60c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn41@2020_3/2020/09/04/17-11-02-604_eb2f2d9ff1daea87.webp","destWidth":1024,"destHeight":448,"sourceBytes":183634,"destBytes":183634,"author":"matthewprigge","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/harry-meghan-markle-wide.jpeg?w=1024&h=448&crop=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn41@2020_3/2020/09/04/17-11-02-604_eb2f2d9ff1daea87.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn89@2020_5/2020/09/04/17-11-02-428_c8fa5e32ae89b18f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?i=RudkLd7jNNI:ATSzJNGTV-I:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn46@2020_4/2020/09/04/17-11-21-148_715eb72577a4be22.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn45@2020_2/2020/09/04/17-11-18-942_f1234b5e3acb72a6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?i=RudkLd7jNNI:ATSzJNGTV-I:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn65@2020_6/2020/09/04/17-11-19-004_88dd1bad8575dbc8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/uproxx/features/~4/RudkLd7jNNI":null},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599239462316},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 01:11:02","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 01:11:02","title":"Taco Bell Is Killing The Mexican Pizza, A Longtime Fan Favorite","link":"https://uproxx.com/?p=402537151","description":"\t<div class=\"featured-image\">\n\t\t<figure class=\"post-thumbnail\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"upx-component upx-image\"><div class=\"image-holder\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"495\" src=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mexpizza-tfeat-uproxx.jpg?w=1600&#38;h=495&#38;crop=1\" class=\"attachment-article-featured size-article-featured skip-lazy\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mexpizza-tfeat-uproxx.jpg 1600w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mexpizza-tfeat-uproxx.jpg?resize=300,93 300w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mexpizza-tfeat-uproxx.jpg?resize=650,201 650w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mexpizza-tfeat-uproxx.jpg?resize=768,238 768w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mexpizza-tfeat-uproxx.jpg?resize=1024,317 1024w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mexpizza-tfeat-uproxx.jpg?resize=1536,475 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) calc(100vw - 20px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 40px), (min-width: 1025px) 1024px, 1024px\" /></div></div><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span class=\"wp-media-credit\">UPROXX</span></figcaption>\t\t</figure>\n\t</div>\n\t<p>Taco Bell&#8230; what are you doing to us?

has been responsible for at least three or four perfect movies (<a href=\"https://uproxx.com/filmdrunk/eternal-sunshine-spotless-mind-10-years-later/\"><em>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind </em></a>and <a href=\"https://uproxx.com/filmdrunk/anomalisa-review-charlie-kaufman/\"><em>Anomalisa </em></a>at the top), and at the age of 61, could easily rest on his laurels as one of the greatest screenwriters of all time (not that I&#8217;d want him to). Instead, he has a 700-page novel and a 134-minute movie coming out this year: <em>Antkind</em>, from Random House, and <em>I&#8217;m Thinking Of Ending Things</em>, which he both wrote and directed, out this week on Netflix. </p>\n<p>Knowing that <em>Antkind</em> is about a frustrated film critic named B. Rosenberger Rosenberg (part of the joke is that Rosenberg isn&#8217;t Jewish), it feels almost like Kaufman is pre-emptively daring any unfortunate middlebrow hack to become the butt of an enduring Kaufman joke by daring not to understand Kaufman&#8217;s latest masterpiece. He may as well have titled his latest &#8220;It&#8217;s a Trap!&#8221;</p>\n<p>But fine, here I go into the dunking booth. Honestly, we sound like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Confederacy_of_Dunces#Ignatius_J._Reilly\">Ignatius J. Reilly</a> any time we write a negative review anyway, and it&#8217;s not as if &#8220;film critics&#8221; were ever in danger of winning any popularity contests. Charlie Kaufman is probably my favorite filmmaker.<em> I&#8217;m Thinking Of Ending Things</em> is, as of now, my least favorite of his films.</p>\n<p>Adapted from Canadian author Iain Reid&#8217;s debut novel,<em> I&#8217;m Thinking Of Ending Things</em> takes its title from the inner monologue of its protagonist, played by Jessie Buckley, who&#8217;s thinking of breaking things off with her new boyfriend, Jake &#8212; played by Jesse Plemons &#8212; during a road trip to visit Jake&#8217;s parents (hey, Jessie &#38; Jesse, how &#8217;bout that). The Ireland-born Buckley, previously of <em>Taboo</em> and <em>Chernobyl,</em> and one of the best young actresses around, plays a character known alternately as Cindy, Lucy, Lucia, or Amy, who is either a poet, painter, physics student, gerontologist, waitress, or veterinary student depending on which version <em>I&#8217;m Thinking Of Ending Things</em>&#8216; constantly-shifting reality you choose to believe. </p>\n<p>Charlie Kaufman is one of the most astute relationship chroniclers who has ever lived, giving us the <a href=\"https://uproxx.com/filmdrunk/eternal-sunshine-spotless-mind-10-years-later/\">enduring heartbreak of doomed romance in <em>Eternal Sunshine</em></a> (undoubtedly one of the greatest movies of all time), the narcotic rush of a new lover in <em>Anomalisa</em>, and the petty cruelty of a dying marriage in <em>Being John Malkovich</em>. His movies are about the inherent selfishness of the human condition and the struggle to connect (occasionally using himself as the butt of all his least charitable observations about humanity, as in <em>Adaptation</em> and <em>Antkind</em>). <em>I&#8217;m Thinking Of Ending Things, </em>with a relationship reference right in the title, is clearly attempting to mine some of the same territory. Yet for the first time, Kaufman seems unable to connect with his own characters. He can&#8217;t even name them.</p>\n<p><em>I&#8217;m Thinking Of Ending Things</em> is about mortality, relationships, inherited trauma, but more than anything it&#8217;s about verbal dexterity. Almost the entire first 30 minutes takes place inside Jake&#8217;s early 90s sedan, a two-hander with a single location. To Kaufman&#8217;s credit, this isn&#8217;t as boring as that sounds. Jake and Cindy/Lucy contemplate and complement, ponder and provoke, discussing Wordsworth, <em>Oklahoma!</em>, and the death drive in the animal kingdom, all culminating in a hilariously bleak poem that Lucy/Cindy/Lucia/Amy recites aloud. </p>\n<p><em>&#8230;the sun goes up and down like a tired whore,<br />\nthe weather immobile like a broken limb while you just keep getting older.<br />\nNothing moves, but the shifting tides of salt in your body.<br />\nYour vision blears, you carry your weather with you; the big blue whale;<br />\na skeletal darkness<br />\n[&#8230;]<br />\nyou come home with your mutant gifts<br />\nto a house of bone<br />\neverything you see now<br />\nall of it<br />\nbone</em></p>\n<p>The poem is the clearest evidence of the old Kaufman wit, and feels a bit self-deprecating, like Kaufman poking fun at his own depressiveness (though for the record I always found him to be at least as idealistic as he is bleak). </p>\n<p>Through it all, there are constant tone shifts and brief forays into formalistic experimentation &#8212; the implication that Jake can maybe hear what Lucy is thinking, Lucy staring directly into the camera, the extended, certainly-not-intended-literally poems recited by heart. The stylized, hyperarticulate, tone-shifting dialogue, in particular, feels like it was borrowed from Don Delillo or another author whose characters&#8217; dialogue feels more like drowning in that author&#8217;s obsessions than listening to separate humans speaking. Is Kaufman doing an art? But why? </p>\n<p> This manic invocation of theater, poetry, high culture, horticulture, is the kind of thing I expect from Aaron Sorkin or Noah Baumbach, not Charlie Kaufman. Kaufman&#8217;s experimentation has traditionally taken the form of characters <em>doing</em>, not characters <em>saying</em>. Here the main dramatic tension is our expectation that all these references will eventually add up to something.</p>\n<p>When Jake and whatsherface finally arrive at Jake&#8217;s parents&#8217; isolated farmhouse in the midst of a blizzard, the action gets darker, more provocative. There are scratches on the door to the basement. A border-collie that won&#8217;t stop shaking. A pool of blood on the floor of the barn where Jake tells us some pigs got eaten alive by maggots. What&#8217;s happening here? Clearly an art of some kind. (<em>Bone, everything you see&#8230;</em>)</p>\n<p>David Thewlis (voice of the lead in <em>Anomalisa</em> and the yucky-toothed guy in <em>Fargo</em> season 3) plays Jake&#8217;s lecherous, belittling father, who goes off on a tangent about how much he dislikes abstract art (didn&#8217;t we already see this character, in <em>Sideways</em>, with Thomas Hayden Church&#8217;s father-in-law saying he only reads non-fiction?). Toni Collette plays Jake&#8217;s high-strung mother, alternately supportive and infantilizing. Both parents flash forward and backward in age from scene to scene, sometimes appearing young and vibrant, other times old and decrepit, confirming anew that Kaufman is most definitely doing an art of some kind. </p>\n<p>Kaufman seems like he&#8217;s leaving us breadcrumbs along the way, patterns and memes and callbacks, to Pauline Kael, to David Foster Wallace, to &#8220;Baby It&#8217;s Cold Outside&#8221; (is Kaufman lashing out at being unfairly lumped in with the &#8220;sad white guy&#8221; artistic milieu?), leaving us wondering whether this will all come together in some Kaiser Soze moment of clarity at the end. He&#8217;s turned his characters themselves into yet more ephemera, probably deliberately, but in such a way that makes it hard to care. For all our selfishness, it&#8217;s much easier to care about people than about whether a person is doing an art.</p>\n<p>The Reid novel from which the film was adapted has been described as a &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/charlie-kaufman-adapting-im-thinking-of-ending-things-for-netflix\">psychological horror</a>&#8221; in the vein of Stephen King, and Kaufman&#8217;s movie feels David Lynchian at times, like a series of vignettes in which a horror film is about to break out but never does. It offers, mainly, the vague sense that this is all supposed to be a fresh and intriguing way of telling a story. And this intrigue is meant to be enough for us not to mind that the characters are all ciphers performing a series of illusory bits and homages amidst a frozen wasteland. This dearth of recognizable humanity and situations made me feel, presumably Kaufman-like, trapped inside my own head, both lonely and bored.</p>\n<p>Maybe it&#8217;s quarantine, but lately I find myself feeling less and less interested in the innovative storytelling techniques and groundbreaking formal experimentation that once inspired me, and which, to some extent, were Kaufman&#8217;s bread and butter. These days I kind of just want to meet interesting characters and go to interesting places. <a href=\"https://uproxx.com/tv/ted-lasso-review-apple-tv-jason-sudeikis/\"><em>Ted Lasso</em></a> looks like absolute Disney drivel on paper, but had me hooked, thanks to a cast of characters I just wanted to hang out with for a while and a setting that was just enough outside my daily experience as to offer some novelty. <em>Ted Lasso</em> is a decidedly less ambitious thing than <em>I&#8217;m Thinking of Ending Things</em> and I judge them through different lenses (and yes, some dull critic invoking a dopey commercial television show in a review of a Charlie Kaufman movie would probably make a great bit for B. Rosenberger Rosenberg). But maybe a polarized world that always feels on the brink of some fresh collapse has made me yearn for simple stories of nice people, interesting places, and low stakes. I don&#8217;t know. </p>\n<p>Maybe, like <a href=\"https://mlb.nbcsports.com/2020/07/05/sean-doolittle-sports-are-like-the-reward-of-a-functioning-society/\">Sean Dolittle said of sports recently</a>, Charlie Kaufman movies are a reward for a functioning society. Or maybe this one just wasn&#8217;t quite as good.</p>\n<p><em>&#8216;I&#8217;m Thinking Of Ending Things&#8217; streams on Netflix on September 4.

On the first day of shooting Moore’s lead actor dies in a stunt accident and lets him cash in on a huge insurance policy. That gives Barber an idea to do the same. They take a horrible script called <em>The Oldest Gun In The West</em> and hire a washed-up cowboy actor, Duke Montana (Tommy Lee Jones) to play the lead.

This year, for obvious reasons, <a href=\"https://uproxx.com/life/oktoberfest-party-guide/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Oktoberfest </a>in Munich, Germany, has been <a href=\"https://uproxx.com/life/why-oktoberfest-was-canceled/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">canceled</a>. This is a real bummer for fans of dirndls, giant beer mugs, day drinking, and pretzels as big as your head. But, while the biggest beer festival on the planet is on hiatus this year, you can still throw on your lederhosen, grab an accordion, and hoist your favorite brews from Löwenbräu, Spaten, Hofbräu. Paulaner, Augustiner, or Hacker-Pschorr. Or, you could try one of the many Oktoberfest-style beers available from U.S. breweries. </p> \n<p>“There are many American Oktoberfest-style beers that stand out to me,” says Zachary Shore, bartender at <a href=\"https://www.thompsonhotels.com/hotels/washington/seattle/thompson-seattle/eat-and-drink/the-nest\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Nest</a> in Seattle. “The first being from Sierra Nevada out of California.” Shore continues, “For the first time, Bitburger’s house sealed hops and yeast were used outside of the brewery to provide a true German-style Oktoberfest beer in America.” And, although Bitburger isn’t a traditional Oktoberfest beer (the beers have to be brewed in Munich’s city limits), it’s still a win for Sierra Nevada and American beer drinkers. </p> \n<p>It seems like every brewery makes an Oktoberfest-style beer these days. To find the best, we asked a handful of <a href=\"https://uproxx.com/topic/bartenders-tell-us/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bartenders</a> to tell us what Oktoberfest beer they’ll be drinking this fall. </p> \n<h3>Dry Dock Docktoberfest</h3> \n<div class=\"embed-holder\" style=\"--embed-ratio:100%;\">\n <iframe width=\"320\" height=\"320\" src=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B2cXM6AJWxe/embed/\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n</div> \n<p><strong>Suman Pradham, director of outlets at <a href=\"https://www.viceroyhotelsandresorts.com/snowmass\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Viceroy Snowmass</a> in Snowmass Village, Colorado</strong></p> \n<p><em>Dry Dock Oktoberfest has a light but delightful nose of pilsner malt and earthy hops. It’s very biscuity. The flavor is also light yet inviting with a smooth pilsner base from which a gentle caramel flavor builds mild bitterness with a nice earthy hop character. It’s crisp and clean and smooth. The beer finishes almost creamy, lighter bodied, and well carbonated.</em></p> \n<h3>Metropolitan Afterburner</h3> \n<div class=\"embed-holder\" style=\"--embed-ratio:100%;\">\n <iframe width=\"320\" height=\"320\" src=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CD7Al3PBQZv/embed/\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n</div> \n<p><strong>Hayden Miller, head bartender at <a href=\"https://uproxx.com/?p=402533623/Bodega Taqueria y Tequila\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bodega Taqueria y Tequila</a> in Miami</strong></p> \n<p><em>Metropolitan Afterburner is my favorite American beer for the season. The limited release is a shame because this beer absolutely crushes. Balanced and not aggressive with just a touch above that session ABV at around 6%. It’s perfect for a cool autumn eve.</em></p> \n<h3>Allagash Tripel</h3> \n<div class=\"embed-holder\" style=\"--embed-ratio:100%;\">\n <iframe width=\"320\" height=\"320\" src=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BtrzCzhgG6h/embed/\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n</div> \n<p><strong>Christopher Farzanrad, bartender at <a href=\"http://theglenmarkhotel.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mila Rooftop Bar</a> in Glendale, California</strong></p> \n<p><em>Allagash brewery beers in general. They have a vast selection. If you are looking for a light, smooth beer, they have the Allagash white. But also have stronger, bitter IPA beers and a perfect beer for fall known as the Allagash Tripel. Technically a Belgian-style Tripel, I still hoist it for Oktoberfest.</em> </p> \n<h3>Schlafly Oktoberfest</h3> \n<div class=\"embed-holder\" style=\"--embed-ratio:100%;\">\n <iframe width=\"320\" height=\"320\" src=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BaPZ_w9F9Sp/embed/\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n</div> \n<p><strong>Kurt Bellon, beverage director at <a href=\"https://www.chaobaanstl.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Chao Baan</a> in St. Louis</strong></p> \n<p><em>For a crisp, cool autumn night, Schlafly Oktoberfest is perfectly crisp and light to match solid windbreaker weather situation.</em></p> \n<h3>Sierra Nevada Oktoberfest</h3> \n<div class=\"embed-holder\" style=\"--embed-ratio:100%;\">\n <iframe width=\"320\" height=\"320\" src=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B3p60dNgwtN/embed/\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n</div> \n<p><strong>Veronica Flores, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/_veronicaalessandra/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bartender</a> in Austin, Texas</strong></p> \n<p><em>I’m definitely going to thank my home state and Sierra Nevada for making a beer that I can still find when I no longer live there. I am a fan of their beer aptly named “Oktoberfest.” I’m typically a sour, gose, or stout beer drinker. But with this one, when it comes to flavor and yearly consistency, is enough to satisfy me.</em> </p> \n<h3>No Label Oktoberfest</h3> \n<div class=\"embed-holder\" style=\"--embed-ratio:100%;\">\n <iframe width=\"320\" height=\"320\" src=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B04GR1wAZYq/embed/\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n</div> \n<p><strong>Jon Joseph, director of food and beverages at <a href=\"https://jlbar.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">JL Bar Ranch, Resort &amp; Spa</a> in Sonora, Texas</strong></p> \n<p><em>I am a big fan of No label Oktoberfest beer. It is on a small scale and done correctly. More of a bock than a Märzen, it’s light, refreshing, and perfect for those early fall days.</em> </p> \n<h3>Samuel Adams Octoberfest</h3> \n<div class=\"embed-holder\" style=\"--embed-ratio:100%;\">\n <iframe width=\"320\" height=\"320\" src=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CD7lKSEJE53/embed/\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n</div> \n<p><strong>Aaron Miyakawa, director of restaurants at <a href=\"https://www.princewaikiki.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Prince Waikiki</a> in Waikiki Beach, Hawaii</strong></p> \n<p><em>Whenever I celebrate Oktoberfest with friends, the first beer to come to mind is Samuel Adams. I love the deep amber hue and slight hints of caramel that always remind me of the fall season. It’s not heavy but easy drinking as you can enjoy more than one when celebrating this festive holiday.</em></p> \n<h3>Brooklyn Oktoberfest</h3> \n<div class=\"embed-holder\" style=\"--embed-ratio:100%;\">\n <iframe width=\"320\" height=\"320\" src=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B2_kDS_CnYJ/embed/\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n</div> \n<p><strong>Andrew Erickson, lead bartender at <a href=\"https://fablelounge.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fable Lounge</a> in Nashville</strong></p> \n<p><em>The best beer to have during Oktoberfest is Brooklyn Brewery’s Oktoberfest. It’s a classic Märzen style with sweet maltiness, bready aromas, and subtle hoppy bitterness. It will pair well with any yeasty bread that can be served with unctuous meats or cheeses. Enjoy a fresh poured Brooklyn Oktoberfest with burgers, sausages, or soft pretzels — all of your classic Oktoberfest grub. Just be sure to buy your lederhosen one size up.</em></p> \n<h3>Left Hand Oktoberfest</h3> \n<div class=\"embed-holder\" style=\"--embed-ratio:100%;\">\n <iframe width=\"320\" height=\"320\" src=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B2piPpQhtVf/embed/\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n</div> \n<p><strong>Zachary Shore, bartender at <a href=\"https://www.thompsonhotels.com/hotels/washington/seattle/thompson-seattle/eat-and-drink/the-nest\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Nest</a> in Seattle</strong> </p> \n<p><em>My go-to Oktoberfest style beer is from Left Hand brewing out of Colorado. At 6.6 percent, it is one of the higher ABV Oktoberfests you can get, but make no mistake this beer drinks dry and crisp with subtle notes of biscuit and spice.</em></p> \n<h3>Rahr and Sons Oktoberfest</h3> \n<div class=\"embed-holder\" style=\"--embed-ratio:100%;\">\n <iframe width=\"320\" height=\"320\" src=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CCWqpynBulo/embed/\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n</div> \n<p><strong>Jeff Wood, creative director at <a href=\"https://rahrbrewing.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Rahr and Sons Brewing Co.</a> in Fort Worth, Texas</strong></p> \n<p><em>Rahr and Sons Brewing Co.’s Oktoberfest Märzen Lager is a traditional Märzen. It’s full-bodied, rich, and toasty with a malty sweetness and a balanced finish. It’s perfect for the fall. It’s not only award-winning — with accolades from the Great American Beer Festival, European Beer Star Awards, and more — but it’s proudly brewed in Fort Worth, Texas, by 5th and 6th generation brewers who come from a long line of beer-making that originally started in Germany.</em></p> \n<div class=\"feedflare\"> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?a=Pl1YWpg06YQ:IYLl5twSf4k:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?a=Pl1YWpg06YQ:IYLl5twSf4k:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?i=Pl1YWpg06YQ:IYLl5twSf4k:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?a=Pl1YWpg06YQ:IYLl5twSf4k:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?a=Pl1YWpg06YQ:IYLl5twSf4k:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?a=Pl1YWpg06YQ:IYLl5twSf4k:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?i=Pl1YWpg06YQ:IYLl5twSf4k:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n</div>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/uproxx/features/~4/Pl1YWpg06YQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 04 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":6617,"bgimg":"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/okt-tfeat-uproxx.jpg?w=1600&h=495&crop=1","linkMd5":"264de7fa89b01bb468f93629af15508a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn85@2020_6/2020/09/04/17-11-13-984_68eefc210d30fc93.webp","destWidth":1600,"destHeight":495,"sourceBytes":231618,"destBytes":231618,"author":"christopherosburn","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/okt-tfeat-uproxx.jpg?w=1600&h=495&crop=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn85@2020_6/2020/09/04/17-11-13-984_68eefc210d30fc93.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn89@2020_5/2020/09/04/17-11-02-428_c8fa5e32ae89b18f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?i=Pl1YWpg06YQ:IYLl5twSf4k:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn59@2020_1/2020/09/04/17-11-16-665_bd97228e553954c0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn45@2020_2/2020/09/04/17-11-18-942_f1234b5e3acb72a6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?i=Pl1YWpg06YQ:IYLl5twSf4k:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn65@2020_2/2020/09/04/17-11-19-852_e00ea40c8dd9bb29.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/uproxx/features/~4/Pl1YWpg06YQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn41@2020_1/2020/09/04/17-11-23-195_13ef9309de41ac32.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599239462318},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 01:11:02","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 01:11:02","title":"Sylvan Esso’s Delightful Alternate ‘Ferris Wheel’ Video Was Made In ‘Animal Crossing’","link":"https://uproxx.com/?p=402536935","description":"<div class=\"upx-component upx-embed-url\"><div class=\"embed-holder\"><iframe src=\"//youtube.com/embed/3-NUC2enkl8\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p><a title=\"\" href=\"https://uproxx.com/indie/sylvan-esso-tiny-desk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sylvan Esso</a>, the indie pop duo comprised of working couple Amelia Meath and Nick Sanborn, are gearing up for the release of their third studio record, <em><a title=\"\" href=\"https://uproxx.com/indie/sylvan-esso-ferris-wheel-full-frontal-sam-bee/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Free Love</a></em>.

But since their upcoming album&#8217;s roll-out was hindered by quarantine, Sylvan Esso decided to jump on the <em>Animal Crossing</em> bandwagon and film an alternate video within the popular Nintendo Switch game.</p>\n<p>The video opens with a look at Meath&#8217;s <em>Animal Crossing</em> character. She explores her island&#8217;s carnival, passing by a cotton candy machine and old school arcade games. Meath is able to live vicariously through her character, performing on stage to an <em>Animal Crossing</em> crowd and even lighting up the sky with fireworks.</p>\n<p>In a recent <a title=\"\" href=\"https://uproxx.com/indie/sylvan-esso-interview-free-love/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">interview with Uproxx</a>, Meath and Sanborn talked about how getting into arguments actually facilitated their songwriting process and made them a stronger couple. “Arguing is so underrated,” Sanborn said. “As a Midwesterner, I think I avoided confrontation. I really appreciate Amelia bringing it into my life. We have to say when we don’t like stuff, because it forces you to defend your idea.

As <a href=\"https://uproxx.com/movies/chadwick-boseman-dead/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Boseman&#8217;s death</a> continues to reverberate around the world, Wright shared a personal and touching <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/tv/CEnRJPMBPT6/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">visual poem</a> on Instagram to honor the late actor.</p>\n<p>In the 5-minute video, Wright narrates over a series of nature photos and candid moments featuring Boseman as she expresses the shock of losing the man she immediately loved as a brother. In an emotional moment, Wright shares that she messaged Boseman a few times before his death, but assumed he was just busy. “I didn’t know you were dealing with so much. But against all the odds, you remained focused on fulfilling your purpose with the time handed to you,” Wright says. “God told me that you are my brother and that I am to love you as such. And I always did, and I always will.&#8221;</p>\n<p>You can watch Letitia Wright&#8217;s tribute to Chadwick Boseman below:</p>\n<div class=\"iframe-holder\">\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/tv/CEnRJPMBPT6/?utm_source=ig_embed&#38;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

Even in the current climate, it remains fairly strong as many of us look for an escape from, well, everything. The <a href=\"https://uproxx.com/life/brooklyn-brewery-garrett-oliver-interview/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">craft beer</a> industry has been around long enough now that there are true classics on the shelf that are fairly easy to find nationwide. But what is the best craft <a href=\"https://uproxx.com/life/best-belgian-ales-according-to-experts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">beer</a> to drink if you&#8217;re looking to move away from the macro brands? That&#8217;s a tougher question to answer.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://uproxx.com/life/best-lagers-according-to-beer-experts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Craft beer</a> is a very wide net to cast. There&#8217;s a lot going on from the classic West Coast <a href=\"https://uproxx.com/life/most-overrated-ipas/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">IPAs</a> from yesteryear to the tart sours of the 2020s. It really comes down to what you dig. But, we&#8217;d also argue that it&#8217;s worth expanding your knowledge and palate with new things. So, maybe the best beer for you is one you haven&#8217;t even tried yet. </p>\n<p>To figure out the best craft beers that people like to drink, we popped over to Ranker. <a href=\"https://uproxx.com/topic/according-to-the-masses/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The masses</a> spoke and voted and a <a title=\"\" href=\"https://www.ranker.com/list/best-craft-beers/reference\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">top ten list</a> of craft beers emerged.

Pliny the Elder</h3>\n<div class=\"embed-holder\" style=\"--embed-ratio:100%;\"><iframe width=\"320\" height=\"320\" src=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CEmuS5plP6m/embed/\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></div>\n<p><strong>Style:</strong> Imperial IPA<br />\n<strong>ABV:</strong> 8%<br />\n<strong>Brewery:</strong> Russian River Brewing Company, Santa Rosa, CA</p>\n<p><strong>The Beer:</strong></p>\n<p>It doesn&#8217;t get much more classic than this West Coast IPA. The brew is hopped with a matrix of Amarillo, Centennial, CTZ, and Simcoe hops next to a fine malt. The result is the king of hoppy beers that&#8217;s surprisingly not higher on this list. </p>\n<p><strong>Tasting Notes:</strong></p>\n<p>Floral hops with a pine resin funk greet you. Notes of citrus cut through the resin dank as the florals support the light, bready malty underbelly. This is as dialed in as it gets. </p>\n<h3>9. A Little Sumpin’ Sumpin’</h3>\n<div class=\"embed-holder\" style=\"--embed-ratio:100%;\"><iframe width=\"320\" height=\"320\" src=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B_H-CbhotdL/embed/\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></div>\n<p><strong>Style:</strong> American IPA<br />\n<strong>ABV:</strong> 7.5%<br />\n<strong>Brewery:</strong> Lagunitas Brewing Company, Petaluma, CA</p>\n<p><strong>The Beer:</strong></p>\n<p>This Californian standard is brewed with half malted barley and half malted wheat. The brew is then hopped with (takes a deep breath) Willamette, Santiam, Amarillo, Cascade, Centennial, Chinook, and Columbus hops. The addition of wheat gives the beer a velvety texture that edges it towards a hefeweizen while still sitting squarely in IPA territory. </p>\n<p><strong>Tasting Notes:</strong></p>\n<p>Hops, hops, hops. There&#8217;s a grassy nature with plenty of that West Coast pine resin dankness. The sip then veers into sunny California beaches with a nice and subtle citrus nature with pleasant florals. The beer ends dry and full of that resinous dank. </p>\n<h3>8. Grapefruit Sculpin IPA</h3>\n<div class=\"embed-holder\" style=\"--embed-ratio:100%;\"><iframe width=\"320\" height=\"320\" src=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BpsjZK-ntBY/embed/\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></div>\n<p><strong>Style:</strong> American IPA<br />\n<strong>ABV:</strong> 7%<br />\n<strong>Brewery:</strong> Ballast Point Brewing Company, San Diego, CA</p>\n<p><strong>The Beer:</strong></p>\n<p>This beer was a revelation when it dropped back in the day. The addition of actual grapefruit to an already fruity hopped beer added depth and accessibility to the often overwrought style. </p>\n<p><strong>Tasting Notes:</strong></p>\n<p>This is a fruit bomb in a bottle with tropical fruits, peaches, and citrus present throughout. The grapefruit is ever-present with a very distinct hint of saline. The beer ends with a rush of all that fruit, making it one of the most thirst-quenching beers on this list.</p>\n<h3>7. Boston Lager</h3>\n<div class=\"embed-holder\" style=\"--embed-ratio:100%;\"><iframe width=\"320\" height=\"320\" src=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CEVdyjGjv6I/embed/\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></div>\n<p><strong>Style:</strong> Vienna Lager<br />\n<strong>ABV:</strong> 5%<br />\n<strong>Brewery:</strong> Boston Beer Company, Jamaica Plain, MA</p>\n<p><strong>The Beer:</strong></p>\n<p>This is (kind of) the original craft beer. The brew is a simple blend of water, German hops, American barley, and Samuel Adam&#8217;s own lager yeast. The rest, as they say, is history. </p>\n<p><strong>Tasting Notes:</strong></p>\n<p>The ultimate airport beer opens with a clear hit of caramel malts next to grassy hops. The hops are an accent to the underlying maltiness and balance well. The end of the sip is dry and short but always draws you back for more. </p>\n<h3>6. Goose IPA</h3>\n<div class=\"embed-holder\" style=\"--embed-ratio:100%;\"><iframe width=\"320\" height=\"320\" src=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CEpkXcQnLhE/embed/\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></div>\n<p><strong>Style:</strong> English IPA<br />\n<strong>ABV:</strong> 5.9%<br />\n<strong>Brewery:</strong> Goose Island Beer Co., Chicago, IL</p>\n<p><strong>The Beer:</strong></p>\n<p>This Chicago IPA was brewed with the origins of IPA in mind. Back in the day, the English used to overly hop their ales for transport to, you guessed it, India. The India Pale Ale was born. The difference with the modern version, however, is that there&#8217;s very little time between brewing and quaffing IPAs, so the hoppiness has no time to fade as it would back in the days of old. </p>\n<p><strong>Tasting Notes:</strong></p>\n<p>Earthy and resinous hops mingle with big notes of tropical fruits that lean more sweet than fresh. Those big notes of citrus fruits lead the way as the bready malts remain buried under the hoppiness. A note of bitterness arrives late on the refreshing and dry finish. </p>\n<h3>5. Arrogant Bastard Ale</h3>\n<div class=\"embed-holder\" style=\"--embed-ratio:100%;\"><iframe width=\"320\" height=\"320\" src=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Bdk4a_hFlda/embed/\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></div>\n<p><strong>Style:</strong> American Strong Ale<br />\n<strong>ABV:</strong> 7.2%<br />\n<strong>Brewery:</strong> Stone Brewing, Escondido, CA</p>\n<p><strong>The Beer:</strong></p>\n<p>The Arrogant Consortia, an offshoot of Stone Brewing, has been brewing this bombastic ale since the late 1990s. It&#8217;s well-hopped and helped define the San Diego craft beer scene. </p>\n<p><strong>Tasting Notes:</strong></p>\n<p>You can almost smell the pine dank before you crack one of these open and that&#8217;s the point. There&#8217;s a toffee-esque sweetness to the malts that just balances all the dank, bitterness, and citrus of this West Coast classic. </p>\n<h3>4. Sierra Nevada Stout</h3>\n<div class=\"embed-holder\" style=\"--embed-ratio:100%;\"><iframe width=\"320\" height=\"320\" src=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CAaB-HXpvh6/embed/\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></div>\n<p><strong>Style:</strong> American Stout<br />\n<strong>ABV:</strong> 5.8%<br />\n<strong>Brewery:</strong> Sierra Nevada Brewing Co., Chico, CA</p>\n<p><strong>The Beer:</strong></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s great to see Sierra Nevada&#8217;s Stout on this list and in the top five. This was the first beer they brewed all the way back in 1980. It&#8217;s one of the better stouts you can find in the U.S. to this day, making it the progenitor of decades of imitation. </p>\n<p><strong>Tasting Notes:</strong></p>\n<p>Roasted and bitter malts greet you with a sense of damn-near burnt espresso beans. The bitterness barely wanes as the hints of black licorice mingle with cacao nibs and velvety maltiness. The brew ends with a lingering sense of a full-bodied beer with serious depth (and milky chocolate). </p>\n<h3>3. Stone IPA</h3>\n<div class=\"embed-holder\" style=\"--embed-ratio:100%;\"><iframe width=\"320\" height=\"320\" src=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B3VLVvRow85/embed/\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></div>\n<p><strong>Style:</strong> American IPA<br />\n<strong>ABV:</strong> 6.9%<br />\n<strong>Brewery:</strong> Stone Brewing, Escondido, CA</p>\n<p><strong>The Beer:</strong></p>\n<p>This San Diego IPA is part of the reason IPAs are still brewed by pretty much every craft brewer, homebrewer, and macro brewer these days. Though there were plenty of other IPAs already hopping up the microbrewing scene for years before this one dropped in 1997, it definitely harkened in a new phase of craft brewing to the country. It&#8217;s also a solid example of the style that&#8217;s, thankfully, not overdone. </p>\n<p><strong>Tasting Notes:</strong></p>\n<p>This is the West Coast in a can. There&#8217;s a nice mix of pine dank next to sweet citrus juices. The juice leans more orange than anything else as the malts peek in with an almost sourdough crustiness. The bitterness from the hops is unavoidable through the juicy end of this beer. </p>\n<h3>2. Lagunitas IPA</h3>\n<div class=\"embed-holder\" style=\"--embed-ratio:100%;\"><iframe width=\"320\" height=\"320\" src=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B74YDTMAgBR/embed/\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></div>\n<p><strong>Style:</strong> American IPA<br />\n<strong>ABV:</strong> 6.2%<br />\n<strong>Brewery:</strong> Lagunitas Brewing Company, Petaluma, CA</p>\n<p><strong>The Beer:</strong></p>\n<p>This is another great example of the ol&#8217; West Coast IPA that helped bring the style to worldwide domination. This brew is crafted to balance loads of hops with a clean maltiness, making this a very crushable brew to have stocked in your fridge. </p>\n<p><strong>Tasting Notes:</strong></p>\n<p>The woodiness of the hops leans away from pine and into cedar territory with a citrus counterpoint. That citrus is more bitter grapefruit pith as the fruitiness gets a little peachy. The malts hold onto a caramelized sweetness with a bready edge that&#8217;s very under the radar. The sip ends with all that resin and fruit as the star of the show. </p>\n<h3>1. 90 Minute IPA</h3>\n<div class=\"embed-holder\" style=\"--embed-ratio:100%;\"><iframe width=\"320\" height=\"320\" src=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BL60X1gjOkl/embed/\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></div>\n<p><strong>Style:</strong> Imperial IPA<br />\n<strong>ABV:</strong> 9%<br />\n<strong>Brewery:</strong> Dogfish Head Craft Brewery, Milton, DE</p>\n<p><strong>The Beer:</strong></p>\n<p>And then there&#8217;s Dogfish Head, another powerhouse of the 90&#8217;s craft beer evolution. This beer is named after the fact that it&#8217;s hopped for 90 straight minutes, adding some serious hoppiness to the malty foundation. </p>\n<p><strong>Tasting Notes:</strong></p>\n<p>Pine, orange rind, and malty bread mingle on the nose. Toffee sweetness creates a base on which florals flourish and mix with bright citrus and grassy dankness. The sip ends briskly with plenty of juice, resin, and subtle sweetness.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?a=M1Qcc-0Shsw:z-WO2ZehMLw:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?a=M1Qcc-0Shsw:z-WO2ZehMLw:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?i=M1Qcc-0Shsw:z-WO2ZehMLw:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?a=M1Qcc-0Shsw:z-WO2ZehMLw:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?a=M1Qcc-0Shsw:z-WO2ZehMLw:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?a=M1Qcc-0Shsw:z-WO2ZehMLw:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?i=M1Qcc-0Shsw:z-WO2ZehMLw:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/uproxx/features/~4/M1Qcc-0Shsw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 04 Sep 2020 16:00:00 +0000","feedId":6617,"bgimg":"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/craft-tfeat-uproxx.jpg?w=1600&h=495&crop=1","linkMd5":"0eb56e33dbfa1b0da00503f807816b88","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn67@2020_1/2020/09/04/17-11-02-602_b42805db9edf123c.webp","destWidth":1600,"destHeight":495,"sourceBytes":168508,"destBytes":168508,"author":"Zachary Johnston","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/craft-tfeat-uproxx.jpg?w=1600&h=495&crop=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn67@2020_1/2020/09/04/17-11-02-602_b42805db9edf123c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn89@2020_5/2020/09/04/17-11-02-428_c8fa5e32ae89b18f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?i=M1Qcc-0Shsw:z-WO2ZehMLw:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn55@2020_3/2020/09/04/17-11-20-402_36ad3d8bf08a001b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn45@2020_2/2020/09/04/17-11-18-942_f1234b5e3acb72a6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?i=M1Qcc-0Shsw:z-WO2ZehMLw:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn14@2020_1/2020/09/04/17-11-19-360_ae59f3153cd39b49.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/uproxx/features/~4/M1Qcc-0Shsw":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn34@2020_3/2020/09/04/17-11-22-463_38e7d72b56362a79.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599239462308},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 01:11:02","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 01:11:02","title":"Amazon’s ‘Welcome To The Blumhouse’ Trailer Is Here To Make Sure Halloween Happens This Year","link":"https://uproxx.com/?p=402534736","description":"<div class=\"upx-component upx-embed-url\"><div class=\"embed-holder\"><iframe src=\"//youtube.com/embed/DD5F0ets7ps?feature=youtu.be\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Halloween as we know it (parties, costumes, bars) probably shouldn&#8217;t happen this year for obvious reasons. However, Blumhouse Television and Amazon Studios have <a title=\"\" href=\"https://uproxx.com/movies/welcome-to-the-blumhouse-amazon-october/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">teamed up</a> to bring Halloween to your living room &#8212; in the form of four horror movies. Beginning on October 6, Amazon Prime will start releasing these titles, so you can start feeding those spooky urges as the witching month heats up. They might be best enjoyed while pilfering through a mixed candy bag and chomping on Snickers, who knows? But skip the candy corn. That stuff is trash.</p>\n<p>Some recognizable faces, including Joey King in <em>The Lie</em>, pop up in the above trailer, as well as a new song by FJØRA, &#8220;What&#8217;s Up,&#8221; which was produced by the late 4 Non Blondes lead singer, Linda Perry (as a reimagining of Perry’s original version of the song). Here&#8217;s a list of all four movies:</p>\n<p>&#8211; <em>Black Box</em> (Oct. 6): A single father involved in a tragic car accident agrees to an experimental treatment that results in a terrifying identity crisis.</p>\n<p>&#8211; <em>The Lie</em> (Oct. 6): Two parents race to cover up the crime after their teenage daughter confesses that she killed her best friend. This, naturally, results in even more lies and deception.</p>\n<p>&#8211; <em>Evil Eye</em> (Oct 13): A mother grows convinced that her daughter&#8217;s boyfriend actually holds a dark connection to mom&#8217;s past. Uh-oh. </p>\n<p>&#8211; <em>Nocturne</em> (Oct 13): An elite music academy becomes an unsettling setting when a mysterious notebook (belonging to a dead student) invigorates a timid girl&#8217;s practice.</p>\n<p>Blumhouse rarely swings and misses, so this is promising news for those Saturday nights when big Halloween gatherings won&#8217;t be such a good idea in 2020. Stay safe everyone, and pop some popcorn for a few double features.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?a=ZULJh1aYmd0:wDj8NhFI9zs:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?a=ZULJh1aYmd0:wDj8NhFI9zs:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?i=ZULJh1aYmd0:wDj8NhFI9zs:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?a=ZULJh1aYmd0:wDj8NhFI9zs:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?a=ZULJh1aYmd0:wDj8NhFI9zs:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?a=ZULJh1aYmd0:wDj8NhFI9zs:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?i=ZULJh1aYmd0:wDj8NhFI9zs:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/uproxx/features/~4/ZULJh1aYmd0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Sep 2020 16:44:19 +0000","feedId":6617,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=qj6IDK7rITs","linkMd5":"73cbed39a48528d8e51000d9fc49dd1e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn89@2020_5/2020/09/04/17-11-02-428_c8fa5e32ae89b18f.webp","destWidth":113,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":1072,"destBytes":460,"author":"Kimberly Ricci","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn89@2020_5/2020/09/04/17-11-02-428_c8fa5e32ae89b18f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?i=ZULJh1aYmd0:wDj8NhFI9zs:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn91@2020_4/2020/09/04/17-11-20-563_220af44149ee1264.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn45@2020_2/2020/09/04/17-11-18-942_f1234b5e3acb72a6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?i=ZULJh1aYmd0:wDj8NhFI9zs:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn92@2020_2/2020/09/04/17-11-16-516_ea1fefbb27c25c7f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/uproxx/features/~4/ZULJh1aYmd0":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn58@2020_6/2020/09/04/17-11-21-733_3728cdb1265a6216.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599239462319},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 01:11:02","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 01:11:02","title":"Start Fall Off On A Spicy Note With These Bartender Approved Rye Whiskeys","link":"https://uproxx.com/?p=402533129","description":"\t<div class=\"featured-image\">\n\t\t<figure class=\"post-thumbnail\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"upx-component upx-image\"><div class=\"image-holder\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"495\" src=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/rye-tfeat-uproxx-1.jpg?w=1600&#38;h=495&#38;crop=1\" class=\"attachment-article-featured size-article-featured skip-lazy\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/rye-tfeat-uproxx-1.jpg 1600w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/rye-tfeat-uproxx-1.jpg?resize=300,93 300w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/rye-tfeat-uproxx-1.jpg?resize=650,201 650w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/rye-tfeat-uproxx-1.jpg?resize=768,238 768w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/rye-tfeat-uproxx-1.jpg?resize=1024,317 1024w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/rye-tfeat-uproxx-1.jpg?resize=1536,475 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) calc(100vw - 20px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 40px), (min-width: 1025px) 1024px, 1024px\" /></div></div><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span class=\"wp-media-credit\">Two James/Old Forester/Russell&#039;s Reserve/Lot 40/Unsplash/Uproxx</span></figcaption>\t\t</figure>\n\t</div>\n\t<p>As the summer end and <a href=\"https://uproxx.com/life/warming-scotches-fall-2020/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fall</a> begins, those humid, hot days make way for crisp, cool evenings perfectly suited for the subtle pepper spiciness of a well-made <a href=\"https://uproxx.com/life/best-bottles-of-rye-for-under-30/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">rye whiskey</a>. Some would argue that <a href=\"https://uproxx.com/life/ryes-whiskey-summer-2020/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">rye</a> is the &#8220;spice of life&#8221; you need just at this moment. </p>\n<p>In recent years, rye whiskey has become increasingly popular yet again. Rye used to be the main whiskey distilled in America way back in the day but then history happened. Anyway, this newfound popularity means that there are now countless brands available. To find the right fit for you, we decided to ask the professionals. We tasked some of our <a href=\"https://uproxx.com/topic/bartenders-tell-us/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">favorite bartenders</a> with telling us the best rye whiskeys to make your first sips of fall peppery and spicy. </p>\n<h3>Michter’s Rye</h3>\n<div class=\"embed-holder\" style=\"--embed-ratio:100%;\"><iframe width=\"320\" height=\"320\" src=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CADcsxkHy_D/embed/\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></div>\n<p><strong>Anthony Aviles, general manager of <a href=\"http://www.ritzcarlton.com/en/hotels/florida/sarasota/dining/jack-dusty?scid=bb1a189a-fec3-4d19-a255-54ba596febe2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jack Dusty</a> in Sarasota, Florida</strong></p>\n<p><em>Michter’s Rye has enough smokiness to enjoy with a good cigar (if you’re into that sort of thing) without overpowering it. Yet, the juice carries enough complexity to truly be enjoyed while the sun sets. It doesn’t have the same burn/bite that most whiskeys do, which is something I can appreciate during those 90-degree Florida summer nights.</em></p>\n<h3>Lot 40 Rye</h3>\n<div class=\"embed-holder\" style=\"--embed-ratio:100%;\"><iframe width=\"320\" height=\"320\" src=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CC5ncWMnDGp/embed/\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></div>\n<p><strong>Meredith Barry, executive beverage chef of <a href=\"https://www.angadartshotel.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Angad Arts Hotel</a> in St. Louis</strong></p>\n<p><em>I fell in love with Lot 40 Rye a few years ago. It’s a 100 percent rye mash bill from Canada that&#8217;s distilled in a single copper pot. It&#8217;s great for cocktails, from a sazerac to even a fruity cobbler. The rye spice is persistent on the palate as well as vanilla, cardamom, and the earthy green notes from the virgin oak.

Brands selling MGP stuff are still putting out phenomenal whiskeys. But, I have to go with Old Forester 100 proof Rye. It is insanely affordable and just brings everything I want out of a rye whiskey. It&#8217;s got enough vanilla and caramel sweetness but also has those nice big spice notes and the higher proof just makes better cocktails. If I&#8217;m making an old fashioned or a Manhattan, this is the whiskey I&#8217;m reaching for.</em> </p>\n<h3>Two James Catcher’s Rye</h3>\n<div class=\"embed-holder\" style=\"--embed-ratio:100%;\"><iframe width=\"320\" height=\"320\" src=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BBkol2hHh39/embed/\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></div>\n<p><strong>Rebecah Hunter, bartender at <a href=\"https://monarchclubdetroit.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Monarch Club</a> in Detroit</strong> </p>\n<p><em>If you’re interested in thinking local, then you’ll enjoy knowing that this rye is distilled from 100 percent Michigan grown rye and made with the freshwater of the Great Lakes.

When <em>The Lion King</em> came out last year there was a lot of talk about if it was necessary or not (the overwhelming majority of movies aren’t “necessary” so I guess the answer is “probably not”) even though I wound up quite enjoying it. (Though, a big reason <em>why</em> I enjoyed <em>The Lion King</em> is because I wound up at a “family” screening, which was filled with children, instead of the normal critics screening. And their enjoyment was infectious. Add that to the list of why I miss movie theaters, even though there’s no way I’d go to one right now.) But I at least sort of get the argument that it was too faithful to the source material, so what’s the point if it’s not going to be reimagined at all? (Well, other than the $1.6 billion It made, which certainly classifies as “a point.”)</p>\n<p>Unlike <em>The Lion King</em>, Niki Caro&#8217;s <em>Mulan</em> is a more reimagined version of the 1998 original film. The original film was rated G, is filled with music, and is truly something that can be defined as a family film. This new version has no musical performances, is rated PG-13 (and earns that rating) and is more aimed at the “young adult” market. (Two friends of mine asked if it would be suitable for their children. When asked about a four-year old, I said, “no.” When asked about a ten-year-old, I said, “probably.”) There are some pretty intense battle scenes for a “family” movie where our hero, Mulan (Liu Yifei), stabs and impales a few villains. It’s a bloodless fight, but still. </p>\n<p>After a brazen attack by enemy forces, the local government declares each family must provide one male to fight in the army to defend against these attacks. Hua Xiu (Tzi Ma) was once a great warrior, but he’s getting old and has an injured leg, but he also has two daughters, so he will do his duty and fight. His oldest daughter, Mulan, steals his battle gear and shows up instead, disguising herself (not very convincingly, but whatever) as a man and joins the fight. She fights bravely and saves her battalion, but her ruse (not surprisingly) is discovered and she’s banished. And that’s where Mulan’s adventures come to a close as the end credits roll. (That last sentence is a lie.)</p>\n<p>As I mentioned before, I wouldn’t call <em>Mulan</em> ultra-violent by any means, at least compared to other PG-13 movies. But if you’re a big fan of the original movie and want to show this to someone on the younger side, you may want to judge for yourself first. There are scenes of swords, spears, and arrows all impaling bad people in the chest. Again, the tone here seems to be aimed at the young adult market. </p>\n<p>But I guess the big question here is, “is <em>Mulan</em> worth $30?” Well, first, that’s between you and your god. I will say I wound up enjoying this film quite a bit, and even more than I thought I would. More than I thought I would because the battle scenes are so well choreographed and performed. Instead of muddled CGI, everything is crisp and clear and very well done. And in these scenes <em>Mulan</em> borrows a bit from films like <em>The Matrix</em> and <em>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon</em>. </p>\n<p>But $30 is an interesting price point for something like this and can be looked at a few different ways. On one hand, a person has access to an almost endless supply of classic films they’ve probably never seen that, at worst, might cost $3.99 to rent. So upping that to $30 is a big jump. But it is a <em>new</em> movie. And a <em>big</em> new movie at that. And here in New York City at least, between a ticket, a soda, and some sort of food item, I’ve spent $30 on a movie plenty of times. So that price, in that respect, doesn’t seem <em>too</em> unreasonable, even by yourself. </p>\n<p>But if a person has a family, this starts to feel like a bargain. A big thing to me when discussing these price points is, “do I get to own the movie or not?” I’ve said in the past I’d pay $40 to watch <em>Tenet</em> at home right now as long as I got some promise of a permanent digital file down the line without having to purchase it again. And with <em>Mulan</em> you do get that. As long as you subscribe to Disney+, <em>Mulan</em> is forever a part of your library. If a person has a family and members of that family want to watch it a few times, it’s really a bargain. So, $30 for a brand new movie that was going to be a blockbuster in theaters, and you don’t lose access to the movie, this all seems about right to me. But, <em>your</em> mileage may vary. But, for me (no, I didn’t have to pay for it, so keep that in mind), it felt legitimately <em>fun</em> to watch. It wasn’t <em>quite</em> the feeling you get in a theater, but it just felt good to watch a new <em>huge</em> would-have-been-a-blockbuster movie, even at home.</p>\n<p><em>You can contact Mike Ryan <a href=\"http://twitter.com/mikeryan\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">directly on Twitter.</a></em></p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?a=vuZ05jtEnA4:cHRFLawMhk8:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?a=vuZ05jtEnA4:cHRFLawMhk8:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?i=vuZ05jtEnA4:cHRFLawMhk8:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?a=vuZ05jtEnA4:cHRFLawMhk8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?a=vuZ05jtEnA4:cHRFLawMhk8:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?a=vuZ05jtEnA4:cHRFLawMhk8:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?i=vuZ05jtEnA4:cHRFLawMhk8:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/uproxx/features/~4/vuZ05jtEnA4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 03 Sep 2020 15:59:25 +0000","feedId":6617,"bgimg":"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mulan-grid-uproxx.jpg?w=710&h=400&crop=1","linkMd5":"57d94bc0b185c9ff01fddbe7fa0e0308","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn89@2020_6/2020/09/04/17-11-02-607_aada87dc79cb9a36.webp","destWidth":710,"destHeight":400,"sourceBytes":125828,"destBytes":125828,"author":"Mike Ryan","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mulan-grid-uproxx.jpg?w=710&h=400&crop=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn89@2020_6/2020/09/04/17-11-02-607_aada87dc79cb9a36.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn89@2020_5/2020/09/04/17-11-02-428_c8fa5e32ae89b18f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?i=vuZ05jtEnA4:cHRFLawMhk8:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn68@2020_3/2020/09/04/17-11-19-714_7b1f7179e942fbf8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn45@2020_2/2020/09/04/17-11-18-942_f1234b5e3acb72a6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?i=vuZ05jtEnA4:cHRFLawMhk8:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn15@2020_4/2020/09/04/17-11-17-130_abc9e0db6541dc59.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/uproxx/features/~4/vuZ05jtEnA4":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn53@2020_6/2020/09/04/17-11-21-589_77d3e2d917864d36.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599239462312},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 01:11:02","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 01:11:02","title":"The ‘Sh*thouse’ Trailer Tells A Familiar College Romance In An Endearing New Way","link":"https://uproxx.com/?p=402534873","description":"<div class=\"upx-component upx-embed-url\"><div class=\"embed-holder\"><iframe src=\"//youtube.com/embed/PkA7m1DbeH8?feature=emb_title\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>It&#8217;s not the same thing as a fancy in-person world premiere, complete with a red carpet and photographers screaming &#8220;over here! over here!&#8221; at celebrities, but <em>Shithouse</em> had its digital world premiere at this year&#8217;s called South by Southwest, where <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2020/06/ifc-films-acquires-sxsw-shithouse-1202955370/\">it won</a> the Grand Jury Prize for Best Narrative.

So we can&#8217;t say we&#8217;re surprised to hear that since last weekend, several Burners have been flocking to the Black Rock Desert for an unofficial and socially distanced erecting of Black Rock City, pandemic be damned. </p>\n<p>Local Reno news station <a title=\"\" href=\"https://www.ktvn.com/story/42577528/no-place-like-the-playa-burners-head-to-the-desert-despite-burning-man-cancellation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>KTVN</em></a>, the <em>Reno Gazette</em>, and <em><a title=\"\" href=\"https://mynews4.com/news/local/burning-man-or-bust-hundreds-head-to-black-rock-city\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">NBC4</a></em> all report that &#8220;hundreds&#8221; of people have been arriving in the Black Rock Desert playa since last weekend with all the usual <a title=\"\" href=\"https://uproxx.com/life/photos-burning-man-2019/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Burning Man staples</a> in tow, including RVs, campers, mutant freak vehicles, and art installations. The Burners plan to leave after Labor Day Weekend. </p>\n<p>The state of Nevada seems pretty down for the impromptu gathering, including the local businesses that have been especially hard hit by the damages of the pandemic, and usually rely on the heavy foot traffic that Burning Man brings. According to one Burner, Mark Fowler, who spoke to <em><a title=\"\" href=\"https://mynews4.com/news/local/burning-man-or-bust-hundreds-head-to-black-rock-city\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">NBC4</a></em>, &#8220;We were worried at first coming out here, we heard the Bureau of Land Management may block people from getting out here, but that wasn&#8217;t the case.&#8221; In fact, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) along with the Washoe and Pershing County Sheriff&#8217;s offices and local tribes have given Burners official permission for their camping zones and will be monitoring the playa over the weekend in case of an emergency. </p>\n<p>According to the <em><a title=\"\" href=\"https://www.rgj.com/story/life/arts/burning-man/2020/09/01/burning-man-black-rock-desert-record-weather-labor-day-weekend/5686404002/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Reno Gazette</a></em>, visitors have been advised by Nevada&#8217;s BLM to bring water, food, shade, lights for their camp, and supplies to last their entire stay, probably so Burners won&#8217;t pose a risk to the local community. Currently, Nevada has counted 70,319 cases of COVID-19 and has been on a sharp downward trajectory of cases since late July. The state is currently in <a title=\"\" href=\"https://nvhealthresponse.nv.gov/info/travelers-visitors/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Phase 2</a> of reopening and has a pretty relaxed policy on social distancing and gatherings. According to the <a title=\"\" href=\"https://nvhealthresponse.nv.gov/info/event-organizers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nevada Health Response</a>, &#8220;When it comes to gatherings, the risk is not just based on how many people there are, but rather how closely they are gathered and how they are interacting with each other.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"embed-holder\" style=\"--embed-ratio:100%;\"><iframe width=\"320\" height=\"320\" src=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CEuG3RLHhCd/embed/\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></div>\n<p><a title=\"\" href=\"https://uproxx.com/culture/spring-breakers-coronavirus/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Unlike spring breakers</a> at the start of the pandemic or <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/covid-19-death-tied-sturgis-rally-reported-minnesota-72777302\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sturgis bikers</a> last month, Burners seem pretty conscious of the dangers of COVID-19 exposure. &#8216;Bureaucracy,&#8217; one of this weekend&#8217;s event organizers told <em><a title=\"\" href=\"https://mynews4.com/news/local/burning-man-or-bust-hundreds-head-to-black-rock-city\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">NBC4</a></em>, &#8220;People made the decision to come here during a global pandemic. So we decided to keep people&#8217;s camps 200 feet away from one another and to advise wearing masks when meeting others. If people feel safe, they then should make others feel safe.&#8221; Burners it seems, are pretty accepting of the changes, &#8220;It&#8217;s just like asking somebody, &#8216;hey is one burn better than the next?&#8217; The answer is no. It&#8217;s just another chapter in our book,&#8221; Burner Mark Debbie told <em><a title=\"\" href=\"https://www.ktvn.com/story/42577528/no-place-like-the-playa-burners-head-to-the-desert-despite-burning-man-cancellation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">KTVN</a></em>. </p>\n<p>While Burners are optimistic and aware that putting themselves in possible danger is their own choice, any type of travel increases the risk of COVID-19 transmission. Peter &#8216;Happy Mentor&#8217; a middle school English teacher and Burner who talked to KTVN remarked on the use of masks when venturing into town, saying &#8220;We want to keep people in the town healthy and we&#8217;re trying to abide by the rules and have a good time,&#8221; but acknowledged that a lot of Burners aren&#8217;t wearing face coverings out on the playa, where temperatures are expected to tip into triple digits this weekend. </p>\n<p>While this is likely to be one of the most interesting and crunchy &#8220;Burning Mans&#8221; of all time &#8212; what are people going to do with their poop?! &#8212; we&#8217;d rather take our chances with <a title=\"\" href=\"https://uproxx.com/life/burning-man-2020-canceled/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the digital experience</a>, where our own private bathrooms are just a few steps away.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?a=C5pNtPBHQIE:r5ANraS2jnI:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?a=C5pNtPBHQIE:r5ANraS2jnI:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?i=C5pNtPBHQIE:r5ANraS2jnI:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?a=C5pNtPBHQIE:r5ANraS2jnI:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?a=C5pNtPBHQIE:r5ANraS2jnI:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?a=C5pNtPBHQIE:r5ANraS2jnI:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?i=C5pNtPBHQIE:r5ANraS2jnI:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/uproxx/features/~4/C5pNtPBHQIE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 04 Sep 2020 17:03:18 +0000","feedId":6617,"bgimg":"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/burningman-tfeat-uproxx.jpg?w=1600&h=495&crop=1","linkMd5":"a2caaf2de13ae90502300edfd7d004c0","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn6@2020_6/2020/09/04/17-11-03-619_5770750e2dd0a9fa.webp","destWidth":1600,"destHeight":495,"sourceBytes":433706,"destBytes":433706,"author":"daneriveralpc","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/burningman-tfeat-uproxx.jpg?w=1600&h=495&crop=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn6@2020_6/2020/09/04/17-11-03-619_5770750e2dd0a9fa.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn89@2020_5/2020/09/04/17-11-02-428_c8fa5e32ae89b18f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?i=C5pNtPBHQIE:r5ANraS2jnI:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn31@2020_1/2020/09/04/17-11-16-640_48ac66a4f06d3c10.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn45@2020_2/2020/09/04/17-11-18-942_f1234b5e3acb72a6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?i=C5pNtPBHQIE:r5ANraS2jnI:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn45@2020_5/2020/09/04/17-11-17-424_b6ee7cc893a04c14.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/uproxx/features/~4/C5pNtPBHQIE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn88@2020_1/2020/09/04/17-11-18-328_6aadf8063b4acb82.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599239462315},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 01:11:02","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 01:11:02","title":"PUMA Is Releasing A ‘Super Mario 64’ Inspired RS-Dreamer For Mario’s 35th Birthday","link":"https://uproxx.com/?p=402536536","description":"\t<div class=\"featured-image\">\n\t\t<figure class=\"post-thumbnail\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"upx-component upx-image\"><div class=\"image-holder\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"495\" src=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mario-tfeat-uproxx.jpg?w=1600&#38;h=495&#38;crop=1\" class=\"attachment-article-featured size-article-featured skip-lazy\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mario-tfeat-uproxx.jpg 1600w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mario-tfeat-uproxx.jpg?resize=300,93 300w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mario-tfeat-uproxx.jpg?resize=650,201 650w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mario-tfeat-uproxx.jpg?resize=768,238 768w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mario-tfeat-uproxx.jpg?resize=1024,317 1024w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mario-tfeat-uproxx.jpg?resize=1536,475 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) calc(100vw -

We&#8217;re absolutely shocked that this is pretty tastefully done. The Super Mario branding on the tongue doesn&#8217;t feel at all intrusive, and the midsole gradient detailing and mixed suede and mesh upper subtlely suggest the iconography of Mario, rather than <a title=\"\" href=\"https://uproxx.com/style/adidas-darth-vader-sneaker-where-to-buy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">hit you over the head</a> with Nintendo imagery. We could totally see Seinfeld rocking a pair of these in an episode of <em>Comedians in Cars</em> if he didn&#8217;t always opt for Nikes. </p>\n<p>Despite the cross-brand promotion, the RS-Dreamer Super Mario 64 is still built with performance in mind and features a disruptive cord lacing system, giving the wearer a snug and highly responsive fit that is complemented by the RS-Foam heel and ProFoam midsole which provide comfortability and maximum energy return on the court. </p>\n<p>The RS-Dreamer Super Mario 64 is set to make an on-court appearance soon in both the NBA and WNBA. Though, we&#8217;re in luck as it will hit retailers much sooner. The PUMA RS-Dreamer is set to drop on September 4th for a retail price of $125.

<a title=\"\" href=\"https://uproxx.com/style/where-to-buy-boba-fett-adidas-top-ten-hi/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Boba Fett Adidas Top Ten Hi</a>, Adidas has revealed the latest addition to its group of silhouettes celebrating the 40th Anniversary of the <em>Empire Strikes Back</em>, The Darth Vader Superstar. Oh wait, no sorry, they&#8217;re not actually called the <a title=\"\" href=\"https://uproxx.com/hitfix/darth-vader-idiot/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Darth Vader</a> Superstar, Adidas has chosen to oddly dub these kicks &#8220;Superstar Star Wars Shoes.&#8221; Last week&#8217;s release was officially named the &#8220;Top Ten Hi Boba Fett.&#8221; But these? They get the generic name. </p>\n<p>That&#8217;s probably because, while both the Darth Vader Superstar and the Boba Fett would&#8217;ve never made it on our <a title=\"\" href=\"https://uproxx.com/style/where-to-buy-jordan-1-bio-hack/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">weekly roundup of the best sneakers</a>. The Vaders aren&#8217;t nearly as cool as the Fetts. The Fetts were full of small fan-servicey details that reflected their namesake in a really cool way &#8212; they even came with a pouch! But the Vader Superstar does little to reflect the sith lord they&#8217;re named after aside from dress the sneaker in matte black leather. </p>\n<p>Admittedly, we do like the stitching on the upper and the reflective three-stripes that are meant to resemble the lines and detailing in Vader&#8217;s suit. But, we would&#8217;ve liked to see Adidas lean more into functional design details rather than using more obvious signifiers like the imperial insignia on the heel tab, or the tongue portrait of Vader. </p>\n<figure id=\"402536462\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-402536462\" src=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Superstar_Star_Wars_Shoes_Black_FX9302_011_hover_standard.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" srcset=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Superstar_Star_Wars_Shoes_Black_FX9302_011_hover_standard.jpg 840w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Superstar_Star_Wars_Shoes_Black_FX9302_011_hover_standard.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Superstar_Star_Wars_Shoes_Black_FX9302_011_hover_standard.jpg?resize=650,650 650w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Superstar_Star_Wars_Shoes_Black_FX9302_011_hover_standard.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Superstar_Star_Wars_Shoes_Black_FX9302_011_hover_standard.jpg?resize=550,550 550w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Superstar_Star_Wars_Shoes_Black_FX9302_011_hover_standard.jpg?resize=470,470 470w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span class=\"wp-media-credit\">Adidas</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>In another head-scratching move, Adidas also replaced the Superstar&#8217;s iconic shell toe with a toe box shaped like Darth Vader&#8217;s mask and helmet. Finally, the &#8220;Superstar Star Wars Shoes&#8221; feature translucent outsoles revealing the words &#8220;I Am Your Father.&#8221; Which, sure, is no doubt the most iconic line from <em>Empire Strikes Back</em>, but to print it on the bottom of a shoe? Hilarious.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a shame that of the full collection, which has so far featured a Luke Skywalker Stan Smith, Stormtrooper NMD R1, Lando Calrissian NMD RI V2, and a Boba Fest Top Ten Hi, the Darth Vader Superstar &#8212; ahem Superstar Star Wars Shoes &#8212; are the weakest by far. </p>\n<p>Vader deserved better than this.

Image</span></figcaption>\t\t</figure>\n\t</div>\n\t<p>On Wednesday, September 2, 2020, Keanu Reeves turned 56 years young — and we use the word “young,” not “old” because he still looks better than most people in their 30s. The actor and <a href=\"https://uproxx.com/viral/keanu-reeves-photos-female-fans/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">by-all-accounts genuinely decent human</a> is arguably more beloved now than he’s ever been, even at the height of Speed and Matrix mania. He’s aged like fine wine, blossoming into one of the screen’s most welcome presences, from the <em>John Wick</em> movies to the new <em>Bill &#38; Ted</em> threequel to his instantly memed <em>Always Be My Maybe</em> cameo.</p>\n<p>Everyone loves Keanu, and for proof, all you had to do was head to social media. There, you found endless well-wishes, dreamy pictures, even anecdotes that showed what a stand-up guy he is, on top of being a terrific thespian. One story that went viral came from a sports writer from Australia.</p>\n<div class=\"iframe-holder\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">In honor of John Wick 3 I have a Keanu Reeves story.</p>\n<p>&#8212; James Dator (@James_Dator) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/James_Dator/status/1129381527702446080?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 17, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div>\n<p>The anecdote was actually quite old, originally posted in May of 2019. “In honor of John Wick 3 I have a Keanu Reeves story,” wrote SBNation’s James Datar. And it was a good one:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Keanu came to the movie theater I worked at in Sydney in 2001. He was working on the Matrix series at the time. It’s a quiet, Wednesday morning — almost nobody is seeing movies. I’m working the box office, bored as hell and suddenly this dude walks up in jeans, a leather jacket and a horse riding helmet. A full ass, weird equestrian looking helmet. It takes me a solid 30 seconds to ignore the helmet and realize it’s Keanu Reeves. He wants to buy a ticket for “From Hell,” the Johnny Depp movie. I’m so fucking star struck I do what any sensible 16-year-old does and tell him I’d like to give him my employee discount. This means he needs to sign my sheet and therefore I have his autograph. “I don’t work here,” Keanu says. Seemingly confused by my offer. I’m flustered and just charge him the normal price. Kicking myself after for not getting his autograph. 2 minutes later there’s a knock on the door behind me that leads into the box office. I assume it’s my manager. It’s Keanu. “I realized you probably wanted my autograph,” he says. “So I signed this.” He hands me a receipt from the concessions stand that he signed on the back. He then casually throws an ice cream cone in the trash can and sees his movie. I realize later that he bought an ice cream cone he didn’t want, just to get receipt paper so he could scribble his autograph for a 16-year-old idiot.</p></blockquote>\n<p>There were plenty of other fine Keanu shares on his big day.</p>\n<div class=\"iframe-holder\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">On Keanu Reeves’ birthday let’s just remember when he murdered someone on live TV. </p>\n<p>Wait for it. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/HappyBirthdayKeanuReeves?src=hash&#38;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#HappyBirthdayKeanuReeves</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/iplayted?src=hash&#38;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#iplayted</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/BillAndTed3?src=hash&#38;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#BillAndTed3</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/QRxwKCVogF\">pic.twitter.com/QRxwKCVogF</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; TZE THEE CHUN (@thetzechun) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thetzechun/status/1301213408440848386?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 2, 2020</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div>\n<div class=\"iframe-holder\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">In honor of Keanu’s birthday, here’s some Bill and Ted fanart I made a while ago.

on that note, although the current situation in the U.K., where Matt Reeves is filming is&#8230; not great. However, filmmaker Tyler Perry &#8212; recently recognized <a title=\"\" href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/maddieberg/2020/09/01/from-poor-as-hell-to-billionaire-how-tyler-perry-changed-show-business-forever/#10fd65a534b5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">by Forbes</a> after reaching a $1 billion net worth &#8212; is keeping his usual tight ship running (the same one that cranked out what feels like a zillion <em>Madea</em> movies) with added pandemic precautions.</p>\n<p>This week, as Deadline&#8217;s Nellie Andreeva reveals, Perry&#8217;s time has included wrapping production on <em>Ruthless</em>, a BET+ drama series that spins off <em>The Oval</em> series. He then swiftly moved onto taping fresh episodes of his BET+comedy series, <em>Bruh</em>. This is all happening in Atlanta, which has wrestled with our current situation like much of the South, but it&#8217;s all happening because of <a title=\"\" href=\"https://deadline.com/2020/09/tyler-perry-ruthless-wraps-production-bruh-starts-covid-positive-test-atlanta-studio-1234570682/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a strict bubble</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Perry employs a quarantine bubble model, sequestering cast and crew on the lot for the duration of a shoot. The production follows a 30-page document that outlines the plan in great detail. It involves check-in testing as cast and crew arrive at the studio, with everyone staying in their rooms until test results come back.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Perry isn&#8217;t messing around! This plan hasn&#8217;t gone off without a hitch, however. Perry revealed to Deadline that initial check-in procedure for his <em>Sistas</em> series <a title=\"\" href=\"https://deadline.com/2020/09/tyler-perry-ruthless-wraps-production-bruh-starts-covid-positive-test-atlanta-studio-1234570682/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">turned up four</a> positive COVID tests (among crew members and extras), but since no one had been allowed to congregate at that point, the situation was swiftly contained. The key appears to be keeping people in rooms until they have an all-clear test, and while it sounds simple, there&#8217;s undoubtedly a lot of coordination involved. Much like the NBA model, this is probably the only close-to-surefire way to get things done on a Hollywood scale, probably for the rest of the year.</p>\n<p>(Via <a title=\"\" href=\"https://deadline.com/2020/09/tyler-perry-ruthless-wraps-production-bruh-starts-covid-positive-test-atlanta-studio-1234570682/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Deadline</a> &#38;

The Oscar-winning actress, known for playing androgynous and often-eccentric characters, <a href=\"https://variety.com/2020/film/news/tilda-swinton-venice-golden-lion-wakanda-forever-cinema-1234757279/\">began her acceptance speech</a> by admitting that she&#8217;s been wondering two things: &#8220;One, how much exactly cinema means to me. Two, how to be able to accept this overwhelming honor with a straight face.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Swinton called cinema her &#8220;happy place, my true motherland. Its fellowship is my heart’s family tree. The names on the list of those awarded this honor, meanwhile, they are the names of my masters. They’re the elders of my tribe. The poets of the language I love above others. I sing their songs in the bath. I’m the punk kid film nut hitching a ride to the station to get to the foothills of the heights of their achievements.&#8221; Acknowledging the sincere absurdity of talking about baths and punks and motherlands, she jokingly added, &#8220;By the way, I am only just beginning.&#8221;</p>\n<p>You can <a href=\"https://variety.com/2020/film/news/tilda-swinton-venice-golden-lion-wakanda-forever-cinema-1234757279/\">read much of her speech here</a>, but I&#8217;m going to cut to the end, where Swinton paid tribute to her Marvel Cinematic Universe co-star Chadwick Boseman, who died from colon cancer last week. &#8220;The magic carpet is flying still and ever shall be — the best possible personal protective equipment for the soul. Viva Venezia. Cinema cinema cinema. Wakanda Forever,&#8221; she said, in reference to the salute from <em>Black Panther</em>. </p>\n<p>As seen here:</p>\n<figure id=\"402535211\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-402535211\" src=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/tilda-wakanda.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" srcset=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/tilda-wakanda.jpg 3040w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/tilda-wakanda.jpg?resize=300,450 300w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/tilda-wakanda.jpg?resize=650,975 650w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/tilda-wakanda.jpg?resize=768,1152 768w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/tilda-wakanda.jpg?resize=1024,1536 1024w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/tilda-wakanda.jpg?resize=1365,2048 1365w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/tilda-wakanda.jpg?resize=1920,2880 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 3040px) 100vw, 3040px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span class=\"wp-media-credit\">Getty Image</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Congratulations to Tilda Swinton, who will soon appear in Guillermo del Toro&#8217;s <em>Pinocchio</em> as The Fairy with Turquoise Hair.

Haaz Sleiman previously revealed this his character will be married to gay superhero Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry), and the film will include a same-sex kiss. Zhao&#8217;s <em>Eternals</em> will present the relationship as integral to the story, rather than making it feel tacked-on, and Feige is on board with that approach. He also wants to get to a point where inclusion happens so much in Marvel movies that it&#8217;s <a title=\"\" href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/director-chloe-zhao-arrives-with-hot-oscar-contender-nomadland-and-next-years-eternals\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">not necessarily big news</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>An LGBTQ relationship in the film &#8220;was always sort of inherent in the story and the makeup of the different types of Eternals,&#8221; says Feige. &#8220;I think it is extremely well done, and I look forward to that level of inclusion in our future movies being less of a topic.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>He makes a fair point, and Zhao (<em>Songs My Brothers Taught Me</em> and the upcoming <em>Nomadland</em>, which is already hearing Oscar chatter) seems very confident in how the subject slides right into her movie. She also added that Marvel Studios gave her complete creative freedom with this project. &#8220;I shot exactly the way I wanted to shoot,&#8221; <a title=\"\" href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/director-chloe-zhao-arrives-with-hot-oscar-contender-nomadland-and-next-years-eternals\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">she says</a>. &#8220;On location. A lot of magic hour.

One of the best of 2020. It&#8217;s funny, it&#8217;s silly, it&#8217;s weird, it&#8217;s violent and lewd, there&#8217;s a talking shark, and in one episode, Harley Quinn and Poison Ivy plot to escape Bane&#8217;s Peña Duro North Correctional and Rehabilitation Facility, a.k.a. &#8220;The Pit,&#8221; on George Lopez&#8217;s helicopter while the comedian is doing a stand-up set for Killer Croc and other ne&#8217;er-do-wells.

The fall brings about two distinct and very good beers. One, it&#8217;s officially <a href=\"https://uproxx.com/life/best-german-lagers-oktoberfest-2019/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Oktoberfest</a> season. Even with the main event in Munich <a href=\"https://uproxx.com/life/oktoberfest-canceled-coronavirus/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">canceled</a> this year, you can still enjoy the beers. And, trust us, there are plenty of great German lagers to enjoy right now. </p>\n<p>The other big beer you&#8217;re going to be seeing on every tap list &#8212; especially in the U.S. &#8212; are <a href=\"https://uproxx.com/life/best-pumpkin-beers-fall-2019/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">pumpkin ales</a>. Yes, some of these fruited ales are a bit sugary or too spiced. But with the advent of every other brewery in the country making a pumpkin ale this season, that old view of the style is more the exception than the rule in 2020. </p>\n<p>Hopefully, the <a title=\"\" href=\"https://uproxx.com/topic/best-beers-of-the-month/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">eight beers</a> we’re calling out this month will pique your interest and inspire you to explore exciting expressions made near you or sold at your closest bottle shop. The picks below are regional craft beer releases from breweries that we vouch for (we weren’t able to taste them all this month because of the continued pandemic, so we’re offering tasting notes from the brewers where necessary).</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Related: <a title=\"\" href=\"https://uproxx.com/life/best-belgian-ales-according-to-experts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Serious Beer Experts Name Their Favorite Belgian Ales</a></strong></div>\n<h3>PACIFIC NORTHWEST DROP: Elysian Night Owl</h3>\n<div class=\"embed-holder\" style=\"--embed-ratio:100%;\"><iframe width=\"320\" height=\"320\" src=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B25X-tSj5dY/embed/\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></div>\n<p><strong>Style:</strong> Pumpkin Beer<br />\n<strong>ABV:</strong> 6.7%<br />\n<strong>Brewery:</strong> Elysian Brewing Company, Seattle, WA</p>\n<p><strong>The Beer:</strong></p>\n<p>This is a quality pumpkin ale. The brew is fruited with over seven pounds of pumpkin puree and pumpkin seeds per barrel of beer. Next, the suds are spiked with ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and allspice. That pumpkin and seeds are layered into the beer, giving a real textural nuance of a well-crafted ale. </p>\n<p><strong>Tasting Notes:</strong></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s really surprising who dialed in this beer is. It sounds like the pumpkin should overpower everything, but it&#8217;s more of a whiff of savory fruit next to a mild spice matrix. There&#8217;s a lightness to the body of the beer that helps keep this feeling like a mild and malty, making it more of a spicy pumpkin cookie than an overly sweet pumpkin pie. </p>\n<h3>SOUTHWEST DROP: Bow &#38; Arrow Oktoberfest</h3>\n<div class=\"embed-holder\" style=\"--embed-ratio:100%;\"><iframe width=\"320\" height=\"320\" src=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CEnERuqlHvV/embed/\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></div>\n<p><strong>Style:</strong> Märzen<br />\n<strong>ABV:</strong> 5.4%<br />\n<strong>Brewery:</strong> Bow &#38; Arrow Brewing, Albuquerque, NM</p>\n<p><strong>The Beer:</strong></p>\n<p>Bow &#38; Arrow is the country&#8217;s only craft brewery run by Indigenous women. Their beer output continues to be some of the most interesting out of the entire Southwest region and their Oktoberfest is sure to be another winner to help ring in the autumn. </p>\n<p><strong>Tasting Notes (<a title=\"\" href=\"https://www.bowandarrowbrewing.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">from the brewer</a>):</strong></p>\n<p><em>&#8220;Malty and copper in color, balanced with a bready aroma with a hint of spice and toast, finishing with light raisin and caramel notes.&#8221;</em></p>\n<h3>ROCKY MOUNTAIN DROP: Upslope Pumpkin Ale</h3>\n<div class=\"embed-holder\" style=\"--embed-ratio:100%;\"><iframe width=\"320\" height=\"320\" src=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CEmpDUpF9nB/embed/\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></div>\n<p><strong>Style:</strong> Pumpkin Beer<br />\n<strong>ABV:</strong> 7.7%<br />\n<strong>Brewery:</strong> Upslope Brewing Company, Boulder, CO</p>\n<p><strong>The Beer:</strong></p>\n<p>This is another great example of how subtle (and tasty) a well-crafted pumpkin ale can be. The beer is a combination of local organic baby pumpkins, hops, malts, and a blend of six spices. The end result is a very crushable can of ale with a high ABV, so drink carefully. </p>\n<p><strong>Tasting Notes:</strong></p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a bit more body to this pour. The beer has a fresh pumpkin aroma supported by mild, bready malts. The sip leans into the spices more than fruit with a slightly sweet creaminess underneath. The feel of this one leans a little more into pumpkin pie territory with a subtle sweetness. </p>\n<h3>SOUTHERN DROP: Jester King &#38; Mikkeller Drink&#8217;in the Sunbelt</h3>\n<div class=\"embed-holder\" style=\"--embed-ratio:100%;\"><iframe width=\"320\" height=\"320\" src=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CEkMcE0nP2M/embed/\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></div>\n<p><strong>Style:</strong> Wheat<br />\n<strong>ABV:</strong> 3.9%<br />\n<strong>Brewery:</strong> Jester King Brewery, Austin, TX (with Mikkeller)</p>\n<p><strong>The Beer:</strong></p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re still trying to hold onto summer, then this hopped wheat beer is the play. The brew is mashed with two malts and both oats and wheat with Kviek yeast before a kettle hopping and then a dry hopping. The result is a crushable and distinct wheat beer that feels like it holds a little bit of sunshine in every sip. </p>\n<p><strong>Tasting Notes:</strong></p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a marrying of mild pine resin next to bright tropical and stone fruits with an orange citrus edge. The funk of the yeast provides a nice foundation and the pepperiness of the wheat is a solid counterbalance to all the juicy fruits. The beer edges into dry territory as the mildly floral, piney, grassy, and fruity hops fade into the background.</p>\n<h3>MIDWEST DROP: Revolution Oktoberfest</h3>\n<div class=\"embed-holder\" style=\"--embed-ratio:100%;\"><iframe width=\"320\" height=\"320\" src=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CD_5GEmFnra/embed/\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></div>\n<p><strong>Style:</strong> Märzen<br />\n<strong>ABV:</strong> 5.7%<br />\n<strong>Brewery:</strong> Revolution Brewing, Chicago, IL</p>\n<p><strong>The Beer:</strong></p>\n<p>This Chicago beer is German ingredients filtered through American craft brewing. Bavarian malts meet Bavarian hops and Bavarian lager yeast to create this one. The beer is then properly lagered at low temps for four weeks, and then it&#8217;s party time (this beer is very quaffable). </p>\n<p><strong>Tasting Notes:</strong></p>\n<p>The malts are the star of the show with a toasted crusty bread presence. The malts edge a bit sweet with a touch of orange rind and grass when the subtle hops kick in. A slight spicy edge arrives late as the almost floral grassy edge cuts out. </p>\n<h3>NORTHEAST DROP: Finback Black is Beautiful</h3>\n<div class=\"embed-holder\" style=\"--embed-ratio:100%;\"><iframe width=\"320\" height=\"320\" src=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CCbnEXnpqoA/embed/\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></div>\n<p><strong>Style:</strong> American Imperial Stout<br />\n<strong>ABV:</strong> 9%<br />\n<strong>Brewery:</strong> Finback Brewery, Queens, NY</p>\n<p><strong>The Beer:</strong></p>\n<p>This coffee spiked stout was brewed specifically to raise awareness of the social and racial injustices plaguing the United States.

But 2020&#8217;s not like most other years and we&#8217;ll have to celebrate the world&#8217;s biggest beer fest at home this September. This isn&#8217;t exactly my favorite Munich Oktoberfest beer, but it&#8217;s the one you&#8217;re going to be able to find very easily in the U.S. (mostly). Also, it&#8217;s a supremely crushable brew in case you need to get your drink on this month. </p>\n<p><strong>Tasting Notes:</strong></p>\n<p>Grainy malts and slightly sweet and grassy hops greet you. There&#8217;s an almost corn sweetness to the bready malts. The beer remains light but not without a velvet body. A final flourish of ever-so-slightly earthy hops counterpunches the malts on the end and draws you back for another glug every time.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?a=k88LDAJkG08:YHPJODtElDk:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?a=k88LDAJkG08:YHPJODtElDk:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?i=k88LDAJkG08:YHPJODtElDk:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?a=k88LDAJkG08:YHPJODtElDk:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?a=k88LDAJkG08:YHPJODtElDk:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?a=k88LDAJkG08:YHPJODtElDk:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?i=k88LDAJkG08:YHPJODtElDk:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/uproxx/features/~4/k88LDAJkG08\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Sep 2020 23:00:00 +0000","feedId":6617,"bgimg":"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/septbeers-tfeat-uproxx.jpg?w=1600&h=495&crop=1","linkMd5":"8cbf31635ce8681f402a239a96ea3184","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn69@2020_6/2020/09/04/17-11-02-659_6a04d791f0616033.webp","destWidth":1600,"destHeight":495,"sourceBytes":485132,"destBytes":485132,"author":"Zachary Johnston","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/septbeers-tfeat-uproxx.jpg?w=1600&h=495&crop=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn69@2020_6/2020/09/04/17-11-02-659_6a04d791f0616033.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn89@2020_5/2020/09/04/17-11-02-428_c8fa5e32ae89b18f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?i=k88LDAJkG08:YHPJODtElDk:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn54@2020_4/2020/09/04/17-11-19-594_017041a533e27f40.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn45@2020_2/2020/09/04/17-11-18-942_f1234b5e3acb72a6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?i=k88LDAJkG08:YHPJODtElDk:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn46@2020_1/2020/09/04/17-11-21-828_07409bf470dfc1b2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/uproxx/features/~4/k88LDAJkG08":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn41@2020_4/2020/09/04/17-11-22-350_76ebb0a4551391b3.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599239462317},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 01:11:02","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 01:11:02","title":"Of Course There’s A Reason Why Most Of Christopher Nolan’s Movies Have One-Word Titles","link":"https://uproxx.com/?p=402536452","description":"\t<div class=\"featured-image\">\n\t\t<figure class=\"post-thumbnail\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"upx-component upx-image\"><div class=\"image-holder\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"660\" src=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/tenet.jpg?w=1280&#38;h=660&#38;crop=1\" class=\"attachment-article-featured size-article-featured skip-lazy\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) calc(100vw - 20px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 40px), (min-width: 1025px) 1024px, 1024px\" /></div></div><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span class=\"wp-media-credit\">WARNER BROS.</span></figcaption>\t\t</figure>\n\t</div>\n\t<p>With <a href=\"https://uproxx.com/movies/christopher-nolan-movies-ranked-ranking-tenet/\">the exception of his Batman trilogy</a>, director Christopher Nolan has only made one movie with multiple words in the title. There&#8217;s <em>The Prestige</em>, then there&#8217;s everything else, including his three most recent films, <em>Interstellar</em>, <em>Dunkirk</em>, and <em>Tenet</em>. You could chalk this weird fact up to being a coincidence, but this is Nolan we&#8217;re talking about. There was a fake rumor that <a href=\"https://uproxx.com/movies/christopher-nolan-bans-from-sets/\">he bans chairs from his sets</a> because &#8220;if [people are] sitting, they’re not working,&#8221; as Anne Hathaway put it, and everyone believed it. Nothing is under-thought.</p>\n<p>&#8220;For me, titles are very tricky to be too self-conscious about. You’re looking for a way of expressing something about the film. To a certain extent, it’s a branding exercise on larger-scale films. I’ve always gravitated towards the simplest version of something that gets it across,&#8221; Nolan explained on <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2553930/why-christopher-nolan-prefers-one-word-titles-like-tenet?pv=related_list\">the <em>ReelBlend</em> podcast</a>. He then gave an example:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;<em>Following</em>, I think when I wrote that script, it was <em>The Following</em>, so we got rid of the <em>The</em> and stripped that down. I think that was the beginning of my interest in trying to make things as short and a pithy as possible, really. But it’s all instinct at the end of the day.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>&#8220;Drop the &#8216;<em>The</em>.&#8217; Just <em>Following</em>.

According to a report, the conclusion of the trilogy will see a new edition, one that will try to finish the saga the way he originally intended: with a different name and, if possible, a fix to the story his daughter Sofia played out on film that has been widely panned since its release in 1990.</p>\n<p><a title=\"\" href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2020/09/the-godfather-part-iii-death-of-michael-corleone-cut?utm_source=twitter&#38;utm_medium=social&#38;utm_brand=vf&#38;mbid=social_twitter&#38;utm_social-type=owned\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Vanity Fair reported on Thursday that Coppola</a> is, indeed, releasing a re-edit of the third film in The Godfather series, this time giving it the name he and author Mario Puzo originally wanted for the film: <em>The Death of Michael Corleone</em>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The project, saddled with the lengthy title Mario Puzo’s The Godfather, Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone, will debut in theaters (where open and available) in December before hitting digital platforms as well as physical media.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The very different title is a departure from what&#8217;s been known as <em>Part III</em> of the saga for decades, and according to a release will conclude the series in a different order as well. </p>\n<p>“<em>Mario Puzo’s The Godfather, Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone</em> is an acknowledgment of Mario’s and my preferred title and our original intentions for what became The Godfather: Part III,” Coppola said in a statement according to Vanity Fair. “For this version of the finale, I created a new beginning and ending, and rearranged some scenes, shots, and music cues. With these changes and the restored footage and sound, to me, it is a more appropriate conclusion to The Godfather and The Godfather: Part II and I’m thankful to Jim Gianopulos and Paramount for allowing me to revisit it.”</p>\n<p>Vanity Fair&#8217;s story about the re-release details the years-long retrospective Coppola has had in the press over what he would do if he were to release a re-edited version of the film, so it&#8217;s likely we know what will actually happen in <em>Coda</em>. It&#8217;s also a pretty thorough run through of all the issues the film had with production and casting, which seemed to hamper what we originally got on Christmas Day back in 2020. For one, the role his daughter, Sofia, played at just 19 with little acting experience is likely to be very different. </p>\n<blockquote><p>“I want to show Sofia a new version, because she is so beautiful in it and so touching,” he told Deadline. “She wasn’t an actress. But she was the real thing, playing that 19-year-old Italian girl in love with her own cousin [played in the film by Andy Garcia]. Godfather III as The Death of Michael Corleone is doubly painful because at the end he doesn’t die, but he does worse than die. He loses everything he loves—and he lives. There are certain things in life that are worse than death.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>The film will hit theaters in December, where possible, but is also on demand as the still-ongoing coronavirus pandemic leaves the moviegoing experience entirely uncertain. For fans who may have been soured on the finale all those years ago, they just might be pulled right back in this winter.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?a=Hz6bTEtAva0:hQUr7eX429I:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?a=Hz6bTEtAva0:hQUr7eX429I:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?i=Hz6bTEtAva0:hQUr7eX429I:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?a=Hz6bTEtAva0:hQUr7eX429I:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?a=Hz6bTEtAva0:hQUr7eX429I:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?a=Hz6bTEtAva0:hQUr7eX429I:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?i=Hz6bTEtAva0:hQUr7eX429I:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/uproxx/features/~4/Hz6bTEtAva0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 04 Sep 2020 02:07:44 +0000","feedId":6617,"bgimg":"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/godfather3pullmeout1024.jpg?w=1024&h=501&crop=1","linkMd5":"a208e20914532a1fd21043e1d3f37125","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn1@2020_5/2020/09/04/17-11-02-630_6eb3b7cebf3f5f5a.webp","destWidth":1024,"destHeight":501,"sourceBytes":27930,"destBytes":27930,"author":"Ryan Nagelhout","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/godfather3pullmeout1024.jpg?w=1024&h=501&crop=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn1@2020_5/2020/09/04/17-11-02-630_6eb3b7cebf3f5f5a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn89@2020_5/2020/09/04/17-11-02-428_c8fa5e32ae89b18f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?i=Hz6bTEtAva0:hQUr7eX429I:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn59@2020_2/2020/09/04/17-11-18-011_e984b74fafaf3538.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn45@2020_2/2020/09/04/17-11-18-942_f1234b5e3acb72a6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?i=Hz6bTEtAva0:hQUr7eX429I:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn78@2020_6/2020/09/04/17-11-23-490_285628063b44a3d3.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/uproxx/features/~4/Hz6bTEtAva0":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn58@2020_2/2020/09/04/17-11-19-725_6bc1e646b2cfa843.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599239462308},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 01:11:02","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 01:11:02","title":"The Best Movies On HBO, Ranked","link":"https://uproxx.com/?p=402501015","description":"\t<div class=\"featured-image\">\n\t\t<figure class=\"post-thumbnail\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"upx-component upx-image\"><div class=\"image-holder\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/contagion-matt-damon-top.jpg?w=1024&#38;h=450&#38;crop=1\" class=\"attachment-article-featured size-article-featured skip-lazy\" alt=\"contagion movie matt damon\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/contagion-matt-damon-top.jpg 1024w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/contagion-matt-damon-top.jpg?resize=300,132 300w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/contagion-matt-damon-top.jpg?resize=650,286 650w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/contagion-matt-damon-top.jpg?resize=768,338 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) calc(100vw - 20px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 40px), (min-width: 1025px) 1024px, 1024px\" /></div></div><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span class=\"wp-media-credit\">Warner Bros.</span></figcaption>\t\t</figure>\n\t</div>\n\t<p><strong>Last Updated: September 3rd</strong></p>\n<p>In addition to being America&#8217;s most trusted source of <em>Succession </em>episodes, HBO has a lovely collection of movies available ranging from trashy action thrills to elegant period pieces to star-studded comedies.

Most of the film&#8217;s action centers on Sheen&#8217;s secret mission, his journey from Vietnam to Cambodia, and his showdown with Brando&#8217;s Kurtz, who&#8217;s been driven mad with power.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><a href=\"https://www.hbo.com/movies/apocalypse-now\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Add To Watchlist</a></strong></div>\n<figure id=\"401891253\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-401891253\" src=\"http://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/wintersbone-jpg.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" srcset=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/wintersbone-jpg.jpeg 650w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/wintersbone-jpg.jpeg?resize=300,168 300w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/wintersbone-jpg.jpeg?resize=150,85 150w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/wintersbone-jpg.jpeg?resize=328,185 328w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/wintersbone-jpg.jpeg?resize=387,218 387w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/wintersbone-jpg.jpeg?resize=460,259 460w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/wintersbone-jpg.jpeg?resize=196,110 196w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span class=\"wp-media-credit\">Roadside</span></figcaption></figure>\n<h3>3. <em>Winter’s Bone</em> (2010)</h3>\n<p><strong>Run Time: 100 min | IMDb: <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1399683/?ref_=nv_sr_1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">7.2/10</a></strong></p>\n<p>A film noir set in the Ozarks of Missouri, <em>Winter&#8217;s Bone</em> was the breakthrough role for Jennifer Lawrence, who plays Ree Dolly, a 17-year-old who looks after her family since her father disappeared.

While that may not sound much like the premise of a comedy, director Martin McDonagh crafted a truly hilarious movie. Farrell and Gleeson play off each other wonderfully all the way to the film’s dark finale. But as great as they are, they’re overshadowed at times by an incredible performance from Ralph Fiennes as their boss, Harry. Fiennes is at once funny and terrifying as a man steadfast in his principles, even when that involves committing murder.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><a href=\"https://www.hbo.com/movies/in-bruges\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Add To Watchlist</a> </strong></div>\n\n<figure id=\"401517562\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-401517562\" src=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/a-star-is-born.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" srcset=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/a-star-is-born.jpg 650w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/a-star-is-born.jpg?resize=300,168 300w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/a-star-is-born.jpg?resize=150,85 150w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/a-star-is-born.jpg?resize=196,110 196w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span class=\"wp-media-credit\">Warner Bros.</span></figcaption></figure>\n<h3 id=\"upxpos21\">21. <em>A Star Is Born </em>(2018)</h3>\n<p><strong>Run Time: 136 min | IMDb: <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1517451/?ref_=nv_sr_1?ref_=nv_sr_1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">7.7/10</a></strong></p>\n<p>Bradley Cooper’s directorial debut racked up plenty of awards earlier this year, and now you can finally find out why (if you haven’t seen it in theaters like pretty much everyone else already has).

There are real stakes, especially when we watch Matt Damon&#8217;s character scramble to save what&#8217;s left of his family or Laurence Fishburne fail to manage the crisis as a CDC head, but there&#8217;s also so much scientific jargon that this could be taught in schools. It probably should. </p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><a href=\"https://www.hbo.com/movies/contagion\">Add To Watchlist</a></strong></div>\n<figure id=\"400551993\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-400551993\" src=\"http://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bridesmaids.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" srcset=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bridesmaids.jpg 650w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bridesmaids.jpg?resize=300,180 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span class=\"wp-media-credit\">Universal</span></figcaption></figure>\n<h3>25. <em>Bridesmaids</em> (2011)</h3>\n<p><strong>Run Time: 125 min | IMDb: <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1478338/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">6.8/10</a></strong></p>\n<p>Kristen Wiig and Maya Rudolph star in this raunchy comedy about a woman on the brink of marriage and her best friend who&#8217;s struggling through a series of failures in her life.

To make matters worse, there&#8217;s competition for the maid of honor spot when Lillian finds a new friend in the wife of her fiancé&#8217;s boss (played by the excellent Rose Byrne).

Disturbing. A total mindf*ck.

It’s a horror story, sure, but it’s a relationship drama at its core, flavored with pagan rituals, brutal killings, unsettling imagery, and all-consuming grief. Florence Pugh gives a career-defining performance as Dani, a young woman reeling from a terrible familial tragedy who accompanies her distant, disinterested boyfriend Christian (Jack Reynor) and his college bros to a small Swedish village to celebrate the summer solstice. </p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Midsommar-Florence-Pugh/dp/B07T8K9YSH\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Add To Watchlist</a></strong></div>\n<figure id=\"attachment_401889827\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-401889827\" src=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/1120562-jpg.jpeg?w=650\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" height=\"432\" srcset=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/1120562-jpg.jpeg 650w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/1120562-jpg.jpeg?resize=300,199 300w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/1120562-jpg.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span class=\"wp-media-credit\">Paramount</span></figcaption></figure>\n<h3><em>The Virgin Suicides</em> (1999)</h3>\n<p><strong>Run Time: 97 min | IMDb: <a title=\"\" href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0159097/?ref_=nv_sr_2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">7.2/10</a></strong></p>\n<p>An early work of director Sofia Coppola, this film based on a 1993 novel of the same name, follows the story of the Lisbon sisters, five girls aged 13-17 who make a suicide pact after their youngest sibling kills herself. A sense of mystery and aloofness adds to the girls&#8217; appeal when it comes to the neighborhood boys, through whom much of the story is told. Confined to their house after the death of their sister, the girls find ways of communicating with the outside world through secret phone calls and late-night trysts.

It&#8217;s by no means a fun watch, but Hawke is such an underrated actor that being surprised by his stroke of genius in this role is reason enough to stream.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/First-Reformed-Ethan-Hawke/dp/B07D6V7MRJ/ref=sr_1_1?s=movies-tv&#38;ie=UTF8&#38;qid=1546547889&#38;sr=1-1&#38;keywords=first+reformed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Add To Watchlist</strong></a></p>\n<p><!--pagetitle:--></p>\n<figure id=\"401635129\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-401635129\" src=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/dear-zachary-a-letter-to-a-son-about-his-father-jpg.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" srcset=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/dear-zachary-a-letter-to-a-son-about-his-father-jpg.jpeg 650w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/dear-zachary-a-letter-to-a-son-about-his-father-jpg.jpeg?resize=300,156 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span class=\"wp-media-credit\">MSNBC Films</span></figcaption></figure>\n<h3><em>Dear Zachary: A Letter to a Son About His Father</em> (2008)</h3>\n<p><strong>Run Time: 95 min | IMDb: <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1152758/?ref_=nv_sr_1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">8.6/10</a></strong></p>\n<p>When filmmaker Kurt Kuenne&#8217;s childhood friend Andrew Bagby is killed and his suspected killer/ex-girlfriend reveals she&#8217;s pregnant, Kurt decides to make a documentary chronicling Andrew&#8217;s life. While largely a love letter to a man who touched the lives of many for Zachary, the son he never met, <em>Dear Zachary</em> also tells the starkly bitter side of a broken Canadian legal system that directly endangered a baby. We follow the drawn-out custody battle between Andrew&#8217;s parents and Zachary&#8217;s mother, interspersed with loving snapshots into the Bagby family. The story sucks you in, but it&#8217;s also the at times comedic, fast-paced, and downright enraging documentary style of the film that breaks up the emotional tale.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/B00MF5LH46/ref=atv_mv_hom_3_c_pmrea_brws_11_13?ie=UTF8&#38;pf_rd_i=home&#38;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&#38;pf_rd_p=3524823942&#38;pf_rd_r=7CY0CNQYJ93Q67APKKDB&#38;pf_rd_s=center-52&#38;pf_rd_t=12801\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Add To Watchlist</strong></a></p>\n<figure id=\"402339359\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-402339359\" src=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Terminator.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" srcset=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Terminator.jpg 970w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Terminator.jpg?resize=300,179 300w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Terminator.jpg?resize=650,387 650w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Terminator.jpg?resize=768,458 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 970px) 100vw, 970px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span class=\"wp-media-credit\">Getty Image</span></figcaption></figure>\n<h3><em>The <span class=\"il\">Terminator</span></em> (1984)</h3>\n<p><strong>Run Time: 107 min | IMDb: <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088247/?ref_=nv_sr_1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">8.0/10</a></strong></p>\n<p>There are so many worthy entries in <em>The <span class=\"il\">Terminator</span></em> franchise, but it’s hard not to love the original more than the rest.

The story jumps around in time, showing Swinton&#8217;s character as both a new mother who blames her son for ruining her life and as a woman who eventually blames herself for what becomes of her son. Swinton proves once again that she&#8217;s the actress that indie movies need for complex characters that live their lives in grey areas. At its core, <em>We Need To Talk</em> is about the importance of proper parenting, communication, and probably therapy.

Soderbergh was even able to cut out major studios and keep complete creative control over the movie, thanks to streaming services and international distribution.

Sometimes you want some eggs, sometimes you want a piece of cake; it kind of depends on what you&#8217;re in the mood for. </p>\n<p>That being said, we&#8217;re talking movies, on the internet. The internet was built to host pointless debates and movies were meant to inspire them. If we wanted definitive answers at the end we could just watch sports. People say choosing that your favorite of a beloved director&#8217;s films is like choosing a favorite child. I say that&#8217;s true, and also that deep down every parent <em>has</em> a favorite child. We all have our personal truths; to pretend otherwise would be a lie. In that spirit, these are my truths. Disavow me as you see fit (please don&#8217;t. I want your clicks <em>and</em> your respect). </p>\n<p><strong>A Note On Methodology</strong></p>\n<p>One question you have to answer when ranking Christopher Nolan movies is, are we talking about the films when they were released, or now? Christopher Nolan is one of our most influential directors, usually for better but occasionally for worse, and basically any technique he pioneered or used conspicuously since <em>The Dark Knight</em> has been mimicked by worse filmmakers with diminishing returns. Which has a way of cheapening the original slightly in hindsight, mostly through no fault of the original. Remember how ubiquitous the &#8220;BRAAAAAHM&#8221; sound effect was, post <em>Inception</em>? Remember bad guys getting caught on purpose after <em>The Dark Knight</em>? </p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t have a time machine so I&#8217;ll be judging these movies on 2020 rules. It&#8217;s more interesting that way. Some of the movies I loved initially seem less interesting now, and vice versa. Aside from that, these movies&#8217; evolution over time is also a product of the way Christopher Nolan approaches movies. Inasmuch as he likes to project &#8220;bookish, cerebral Englishman,&#8221; he&#8217;s also a showman (and I suspect looking like an intellectual is part of that show). He made his bones on flashy technique (becoming a hot commodity after <em>Memento</em>) and that kind of flashy storytelling is part of his identity. It&#8217;s hard to watch <em>The Prestige</em> and not see a bit of Nolan in Hugh Jackman&#8217;s character &#8212; meticulous, obsessive, intelligent, but also the guy who likes to be up on stage taking a bow at the end of the show. </p>\n<p>&#8220;Technically innovative&#8221; and &#8220;gimmicky&#8221; are always two sides of the same coin, the former always bleeding into the latter depending on the charitability of the beholder. As such, virtually all of Nolan&#8217;s movies have some choices I find brilliant and others I find slightly annoying. But his willingness to take that chance is part of the reason his movies are still must-see releases even after 10 or 11 of them. I <em>like</em> when he takes big swings. In hindsight I find myself appreciating the boldest moves even if they didn&#8217;t entirely payoff. In any case, if you find yourself disagreeing with me a lot here you&#8217;re probably just reading it wrong. </p>\n<p><strong>10. Following (1998)</strong> </p>\n<figure id=\"402528046\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-402528046\" src=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Following-Nolan.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" srcset=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Following-Nolan.jpg 666w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Following-Nolan.jpg?resize=300,219 300w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Following-Nolan.jpg?resize=650,474 650w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 666px) 100vw, 666px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span class=\"wp-media-credit\">Amazon Prime</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>I debated even including <em>Following</em> in this list, considering Nolan was still an unknown when it was released (and after as well). Costing just $6,000 to make, earning a little more than $48,000 at the box office, and clocking in at a barely-feature eligible but very nice 69 minutes, <em>Following</em> seems more resume builder than stand-alone Nolan film, his self-financed cover letter to studios that might one day give him money to make a feature. Please, Mr. Studio Head, consider the twists!</p>\n<p>Do you need to watch an underexposed, black and white, microbudget indie from the late &#8217;90s to understand the Nolan canon? Probably not, and it explains why I hadn&#8217;t watched it until now. Having watched it (I&#8217;m very professional), it&#8217;s very much of a piece with other indie movies from the &#8217;90s, when budding auteurs like Quentin Tarantino and Darren Aronofsky and Kevin Smith et al made cheapo black and white movies hoping to become The Next Big Thing. Now aspiring directors get five A-list actors for their debut, premiere it at Sundance, and like 20 journalists see it before it disappears forever. </p>\n<p>Anyhoo, I was pleasantly surprised in <em>Following</em>&#8216;s early going, which depicts a scruffy Londoner who follows people around for a hobby. He gets caught in the act by one of his subjects, who brings him into the world of petty burglary. There&#8217;s a <em>Fight Club</em> quality to <em>Following</em>, this portrait of young men living on the margins, seeking a kind of spiritual fulfillment the modern world has denied them, and the mentor/protege relationship between the two. Then the whole thing sort of fizzles into a double-cross plot with twist after twist. This is one of Nolan&#8217;s more unfortunate tics &#8212; his depictions of these odd little communities always seem (to me) better and more compelling on their own without the tit-for-tat constant double-crosses that Nolan always seems to think he needs in order to maintain our attention. </p>\n<p><strong>9. The Dark Knight Rises (2012) </strong></p>\n<figure id=\"402528073\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-402528073\" src=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DarkKnightRises.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" srcset=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DarkKnightRises.jpg 710w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DarkKnightRises.jpg?resize=300,138 300w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DarkKnightRises.jpg?resize=650,298 650w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 710px) 100vw, 710px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span class=\"wp-media-credit\">WB</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>I think I can say that Christopher Nolan is simultaneously a great superhero director and that superheroes are Christopher Nolan&#8217;s least interesting subjects. <em>The Dark Knight Rises</em> wasn&#8217;t <em>all</em> bad, obviously, it had wistful Michael Caine, Tom Hardy&#8217;s Bane taking over a football stadium, and &#8220;that would be very painful&#8230; for you.&#8221; </p>\n<p>But it is a movie where Nolan&#8217;s slightly annoying tics seem to catch up to his good ones. It&#8217;s a movie that makes me kind of hate Hans Zimmer. Or at the very least wish he came with volume control. Nolan&#8217;s tendency to value a &#8220;naturalistic&#8221; sound mix over an intelligible one and his love of a good score made<em> The Dark Knight Rises</em> feel like a music video at times, with an antagonist who mumbled worse than a xanny rapper (which is at least as much a Tom Hardy trait as it is a Christopher Nolan one) competing for aural space with constant sound effects and a bombastic score. Don&#8217;t tell me it&#8217;s more &#8220;natural&#8221; or &#8220;realistic&#8221; that way, this is still a Batman movie. Give me that goofy dialogue. I want to live deliciously, not naturalistically. </p>\n<p><em>The Dark Knight Rises</em>&#8216; Catwoman subplot is also notably forgettable compared to Michael Keaton/Michelle Pfeiffer in <em>Batman Returns</em> (admittedly I&#8217;m the guy <a href=\"https://uproxx.com/filmdrunk/batman-returns-revisited/\">who loves that weirdo Hot Topic goth fever dream</a>, it&#8217;s pretty hard to beat). And it featured lots of nameless extras attacking each other <em>Braveheart</em>-style even when they have guns, which to me is just irredeemably dumb. Sorry, I can&#8217;t do anonymous henchman who inexplicably suicide themselves anymore.</p>\n<p>I tend to think Christopher Nolan was just getting a little bored of growly Batman by this point (or maybe I&#8217;m just projecting) and with the demands of making a bookend, and it shows in some of the cut corners. It&#8217;s always a little more fun to just go where the characters take you than having to write them into a specific endpoint.</p>\n<p><strong>8. The Prestige (2006) </strong> </p>\n<figure id=\"402528090\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-402528090\" src=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/PrestigeJackman.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" srcset=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/PrestigeJackman.jpg 710w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/PrestigeJackman.jpg?resize=300,128 300w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/PrestigeJackman.jpg?resize=650,278 650w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 710px) 100vw, 710px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span class=\"wp-media-credit\">Buena Vista Pictures</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>On paper, it&#8217;s hard to beat dueling Victorian-era magicians, David Bowie as Nikola Tesla, and doppelganger deus ex machinas. Andy Serkis even got to use his real face instead of jumping around in a spandex suit pretending to be a monkey. Nolan went <em>waaay</em> goofy in this adaptation of <a title=\"\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prestige\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Christopher Priest&#8217;s novel</a> and you have to love him for it. &#8220;The Prestige!&#8221; is also up there with &#8220;The Aristocrats!&#8221; in terms of titles that sound good to yell during orgasm. </p>\n<p>Yet <em>The Prestige</em> is also the height of Christopher Nolan seeming to value subterfuge and shock twists over compelling character development, seeming to worry more about surprising the audience than making them care. <em>The Prestige</em>&#8216;s whole story rests on a relentless (and eventually exhausting) feud between two magicians, American Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Cockney Alfred Borden (Christian Bale), constantly determined to outdo each other for the mantle of &#8220;World&#8217;s Greatest Magician&#8221; (see parallels to Christopher Nolan and his co-writer brother Jonathan!). They are helped in this quest by their respective &#8220;ingenieurs&#8221; (aka engineers, an entire concept I&#8217;d love to believe Christopher Nolan just invented even though I know it probably came from the novel). One played by Michael Caine, the other <em>some guy</em> in obvious make up. </p>\n<p>On the one hand, <em>The Prestige</em> seems to be a window into Christopher Nolan&#8217;s soul. It&#8217;s easy to believe he sees himself in Jackman&#8217;s protagonist, the showman who wants more than anything to give audiences <em>grand illusions</em> that allow them to believe in magic for a few seconds, the man who puts the ghost back in the machine.</p>\n<p>That being said, I feel like there&#8217;s a limit to how many times one can use fake mustaches and doppelgangers as a dead-serious plot device. The two magicians double-cross each other so much that you end up wishing they could just be friends. Meanwhile, the expectation that we&#8217;ll be hanging off the edge of our seats and that we&#8217;ll be worrying about <em>who will double-cross who!</em> the whole time sort of cuts against all the goofy fun we could&#8217;ve been having with <em>The Prestige</em>. The film&#8217;s end twist (go look it up, I don&#8217;t want to get yelled at for spoiling a 14-year-old movie) is somehow unbelievable, unsurprising, and unsatisfying all at the same time. Oh? So it was exactly what Michael Caine said all along? Imagine that. The sheer silliness of it would be more fun if the accompanying monologue wasn&#8217;t so utterly self-serious. (Nolan movie rule: pay attention to whatever Michael Caine says.)</p>\n<p>Unpopular opinion: of the two movies about dueling Victorian-era magicians released in 2006, <em>The Prestige</em> was inferior to<em> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Illusionist_(2006_film)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Illusionist</a></em>. What was happening in 2006 that we ended up with two dueling magician movies?</p>\n<p><strong>7. The Dark Knight (2008)</strong></p>\n<figure id=\"1163502\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1163502\" src=\"http://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/dark-knight.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" srcset=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/dark-knight.jpg 650w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/dark-knight.jpg?resize=300,185 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span class=\"wp-media-credit\">Warner Bros.</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>I&#8217;m not putting <em>The Dark Knight</em> this low as a contrarian take but I have to admit that the sheer number of people who treat it as sacrosanct and get pissed when you don&#8217;t agree that it&#8217;s <em>the greatest superhero movie ever made</em> make me like it less and less. It&#8217;s one of those movies that had me on the edge of my seat the entire time I was watching it but that I don&#8217;t feel like I especially need to see again. </p>\n<p>Pros: <em>The Dark Knight</em> was the movie where Christopher Nolan came into his own directing action sequences. Early on he shot largely in the shaky-cam/quick-cut style that was popular at the time. On <em>The Dark Knight</em> he had a big budget to play with and used it brilliantly in masterful sequences like the whole bank robbery scene at the beginning. Also, Aaron Eckhardt was brilliant casting and I don&#8217;t know that I need to say more than has already been said about Heath Ledger.</p>\n<p> Cons: Heath Ledger is brilliant as the Joker, but his performance masks the thinness of this character. <em>The Dark Knight</em> cuts a lot of narrative corners to make The Joker <em>look cool</em>. He kills a mob boss and that boss&#8217;s men are all instantly 100% loyal to the clown man? Is that how that works in the underworld? <em>The Dark Knight&#8217;</em>s universe rests on a foundation of mindless automaton criminals. Partly the years of other directors copying the &#8220;pure sociopathic chaos agent&#8221; antagonist and &#8220;bad guy gets caught on purpose&#8221; have cheapened <em>The Dark Knight</em>&#8216;s impact in hindsight, but partly it&#8217;s also a movie that doesn&#8217;t work nearly as well when you have time to think about any one thing. To Nolan&#8217;s credit, he never gives you that time. I think <em>Dark Knight</em> can be a great movie without being an especially rewatchable one.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Batman Begins (2005) </strong></p>\n<figure id=\"1007345\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1007345\" src=\"http://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/batman-begins-christian-bale.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" srcset=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/batman-begins-christian-bale.jpg 650w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/batman-begins-christian-bale.jpg?resize=300,185 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span class=\"wp-media-credit\">Warner Bros.</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>It&#8217;s a shame that <em>Batman Begins</em> has so many poorly shot shaky-cam action sequences (a time when Nolan and many others cobbled together fist fights from a thousand split-second blurs of feet, fists, lapels, chandeliers&#8230;) because almost everything else about <em>Batman Begins</em> is so great. I prefer the narrative grounding of Liam Neeson as evil mentor and Cillian Murphy/Tom Wilkinson as bad guy heavies to the flash of Ledger&#8217;s Joker. That Cillian Murphy&#8217;s Scarecrow is a bad guy whose MO is sneaking people drugs and then f*cking with them while they&#8217;re high? Genius. This guy is a professional mellow harsher, man! My love for <em>Batman Begins</em> was sealed when that first psychedelic worm crawled out of the eyehole in Scarecrow&#8217;s burlap face sack. </p>\n<p><strong>5. Dunkirk (2017)</strong></p>\n<figure id=\"400704742\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-400704742\" src=\"http://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/dunkirk-feat.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" srcset=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/dunkirk-feat.jpg 650w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/dunkirk-feat.jpg?resize=300,185 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span class=\"wp-media-credit\">Warner Bros</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>I love<em> Dunkirk.</em> It&#8217;s everything <a href=\"https://uproxx.com/movies/1917-review/\"><em>1917</em></a> wanted to be. It also marked a clear inflection point in Nolan&#8217;s identity (Inflection! That&#8217;s the movie he should&#8217;ve directed after <em>Inception</em>, <em>Interstellar</em>, and <em>Insomnia</em>!). Early in his career, from <em>Memento</em> through <em>Inception</em> (and <em>Following</em>, for the 40-50 people who&#8217;d seen it), Nolan&#8217;s calling card was mindf*cks. He was, for all intents and purposes, the mindf*ck guy, the director whose movies would keep tricking you right up until the end credits. Luckily, just as the audience&#8217;s interest in being endlessly mindf*cked was beginning to wane, we discovered Christopher Nolan had become the Large Format Majesty guy right under our noses, so gradually that it had become his brand before we even thought to notice. <em>Dunkirk</em> is the movie that cemented that incarnation of the Nolan brand.</p>\n<p><em>Dunkirk</em> is one of the few movies you could call &#8220;a pure cinematic experience&#8221; and not sound insufferable. It&#8217;s the kind of film that works best, and maybe only, on a giant screen in a big room full of people. If we&#8217;re splitting hairs, the title cards (&#8220;one week,&#8221; &#8220;one day,&#8221; &#8220;one hour&#8221;) and the intersecting timelines feel more like vestigial elements of Nolan&#8217;s older shtick, his belief that he needs to trick audiences to make us care. But they don&#8217;t especially detract even if they&#8217;re not especially useful. </p>\n<p>It also feels a little like Nolan deliberately muffled Tom Hardy&#8217;s dialogue in <em>Dunkirk</em> as a f*ck you to everyone who complained about not being able to understand him in <em>The Dark Knight Rises</em>. I don&#8217;t like it, but I respect it. Christopher Nolan and Tom Hardy is the kind of team-up that&#8217;s even more mumbly than its individual parts. </p>\n<p><strong>4. Insomnia (2002)</strong> </p>\n<figure id=\"402528187\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-402528187\" src=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Insomnia-RW.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" srcset=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Insomnia-RW.jpg 710w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Insomnia-RW.jpg?resize=300,140 300w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Insomnia-RW.jpg?resize=650,304 650w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 710px) 100vw, 710px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span class=\"wp-media-credit\">Warner Bros</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>I sweated over whether to put <em>Insomnia</em> above or below <em>Inception</em> and <em>Memento</em>, because when I was trying to find a Nolan movie to rewatch, <em>Insomnia</em> is the movie I found myself most wanting to revisit. It&#8217;s the most obvious outlier in the Nolan canon. Where Nolan tends to make his bones on flashy concepts, <em>Insomnia</em> was, essentially, a police procedural, one of the oldest stories in the book and the subject matter of roughly 85% of our television shows. It&#8217;s also Nolan&#8217;s only remake (of a 1997 Norwegian film by Erik Skjoldbjærg). </p>\n<p>Having rewatched it this past week, <em>Insomnia</em> not only holds up, I think it&#8217;s gotten better with age. Free of the usual requirement to wrestle a wild concept into believability, Nolan puts all his energy into <em>Insomnia</em>&#8216;s subtler flourishes. Even aside from that, <em>Insomnia</em> is a textbook example of why setting matters. Nothing annoys me more than films that deliberately anonymize their setting, that take place in &#8220;Anytown, USA&#8221; as if that&#8217;s going to make us care more (specificity is always better!). The simple fact of <em>where</em> the story takes place creates so many narrative possibilities, and <em>Insomnia</em> is a perfect example. Removing setting as a story element for a screenwriter is like cutting off your own arm.</p>\n<p> In the Norwegian version, a big city investigator played by Stellan Skarsgard (one of our finest Skarsgards), travels to a town above the Arctic Circle to investigate a murder. He&#8217;s also recently been caught having sex with one of his witnesses (a very European plot point). Nolan&#8217;s American version sees Al Pacino playing a famous LAPD homicide detective (I like to imagine it&#8217;s the same guy he played in <em>Heat</em>, only severely sleep-deprived) sent to Alaska, where he partners with a fresh-faced townie fangirl played by Hillary Swank &#8212; a character who will, naturally, prove to have more smarts and courage than anyone. When he accidentally shoots his partner during a chase we&#8217;re left to wonder if his inability to sleep is a result of the never-setting sun or his own guilt.</p>\n<p>I remembered the unforgettable chase sequence at the log factory which is every bit as good as I remembered, but there were quieter moments I&#8217;d forgotten that stood up just as well. Robin Williams&#8217; self-serving rationalization for why him killing that girl was just an unfortunate mistake, immediately punctured by Al Pacino&#8217;s &#8220;I don&#8217;t give a f*ck&#8221; soliloquy on the topic of motive. But in an era where we&#8217;ve (far too belatedly) begun handwringing about the ubiquity of &#8220;copaganda,&#8221; <em>Insomniac</em> stands out as a story that uses cops not as a cheap shortcuts to heroism but as a lens into humanity. It&#8217;s what a good story should do, regardless of subject or setting. This all culminates in <em>Insomnia</em>&#8216;s pitch-perfect ending, Pacino telling Swank not to cut corners. It&#8217;s maybe Nolan&#8217;s best ending.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Memento (2000)</strong></p>\n<figure id=\"400700675\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-400700675\" src=\"http://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/memento-poster.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"514\" srcset=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/memento-poster.jpg 514w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/memento-poster.jpg?resize=300,441 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 514px) 100vw, 514px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span class=\"wp-media-credit\">IMPA</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p><em>Memento</em> stands out as the reverse of <em>Insomnia</em>, an acknowledged classic and a landmark in the Nolan canon even if I don&#8217;t feel compelled to rewatch it. <em>Memento</em> was Christopher Nolan&#8217;s break out hit, his calling card, the movie that established him as &#8220;ground-breaking director&#8221; right out of the gate. <em>Memento</em> is not only a break-out film for Nolan but maybe the seminal break-out film of all time. Arguably, the star of the film is the storytelling technique itself. How many films can you say that about?</p>\n<p>Is <em>Memento</em> gimmicky? Absolutely, but it&#8217;s a <em>good</em> gimmick, and its success explains why gimmicks exist. When no one knows who you are, One Big Hook helps them remember. After <em>The Dark Knight</em> movies and <em>Inception</em>, Christopher Nolan got a reputation for seriousness, and general lack of a sense of humor. But if you go back and watch <em>Memento</em>, it has a lot of moments that are, at the very least, wry. You don&#8217;t cast <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&#38;rct=j&#38;q=&#38;esrc=s&#38;source=web&#38;cd=&#38;cad=rja&#38;uact=8&#38;ved=2ahUKEwjd8KKhvLnrAhUUr54KHX5eAc4QFjAAegQIAxAB&#38;url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FJoe_Pantoliano&#38;usg=AOvVaw2sQMAJhfbZinyXgbM0x86J\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Joey Pants</a> if you aren&#8217;t aware of the humorous potential. </p>\n<p><strong>2.

To this day I still hear people occasionally use &#8220;snow level&#8221; to describe something that&#8217;s evolved far beyond its initial intention. Snow levels, the spinning top, the <a href=\"https://imgflip.com/memetemplate/Inception\">squinting DiCaprio</a> &#8212; <em>Inception</em> at this point is almost more meme than movie. Maybe that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m a little hesitant to rewatch it. I remember its greatness but we&#8217;ve probably squeezed all the juice from it at this point.</p>\n<div class=\"embed-holder\" style=\"--embed-ratio:56.25%;\"><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qwe6qXFTdgc?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></div>\n<p><em>Inception</em> is the ultimate expression of Nolan&#8217;s obsession with intersecting timelines and with expanding and contracting time &#8212; a storytelling element that&#8217;s present in almost all of his movies in some form or another. In <em>Inception,</em> the plot is almost entirely an excuse for them. Leonardo DiCaprio&#8217;s character also has the same name &#8212; Cobb &#8212; as the burglary mentor in <em>Following</em>. Cobb steals secrets from people&#8217;s dreams, and in that sense <em>Inception</em> is kind of a massive budget, fx-heavy version of <em>Following</em>, in which Cobb broke into people&#8217;s houses and stole, scattered, or moved people&#8217;s most personal possessions in order to gaslight them. If <em>Dunkirk</em> was the culmination of Nolan as Large Format Majesty Guy, <em>Inception,</em> with its kooky dreamscape scenes and rotating hallways, was probably the movie that gave him a hard shove in that direction. Also, bring back Joseph Gordon-Levitt.</p>\n<p><strong><strong>1. Interstellar (2014)</strong><br />\n </strong> </p>\n<figure id=\"943712\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-943712\" src=\"http://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/mcconaughey-interstellar.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" srcset=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/mcconaughey-interstellar.jpg 620w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/mcconaughey-interstellar.jpg?resize=300,180 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span class=\"wp-media-credit\">Paramount</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>How to explain putting <em>Interstellar</em> at the top of the list even while conceding that it is messy and gets pretty silly at times? What I think happens with some of the best movies, and certainly the most enduring and rewatchable ones: intensity outpaces craftsmanship. And maybe that&#8217;s the way it <em>should</em> happen, that a storyteller gets so obsessed and in the weeds of their own ideas, that they crank the amp up to 11 and start wailing away, and what comes out might end up a little distorted or smoke out the whole garage, but in the end we remember the passion more than the sour notes or the property damage.</p>\n<p>Hindsight only sharpens this effect. It seems plain that the initial reviews of <em>Interstellar</em>, <a href=\"https://uproxx.com/filmdrunk/review-love-conquers-space-time-in-interstellar/\">even my own</a>, didn&#8217;t give it enough credit. Was there too much expository dialogue, convoluted explanations, and laughably simplistic depictions of &#8220;love?&#8221; Sure, but six years later I can barely remember them. <em>Interstellar</em>&#8216;s warts recede in contrast to the incredible worlds it conjured &#8212; the giant wave planet, the dust-choked dystopia, the ice purgatory. Nolan gave us more indelible images in <em>Interstellar</em> than we normally get in five or 10 movies. I wish I had a nickel for every time I or someone else compared a situation to &#8220;the first act of <em>Interstellar</em>.&#8221; </p>\n<p>Apologies for quoting myself, but my closing paragraph in my original <em>Interstellar</em> review sums up most of what I love about Christopher Nolan movies and what I hope for every time a new one comes out.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I can understand if that’s not everyone’s cup of tea, or if it comes off bloated or pompous, but I think that’s just the way Christopher Nolan thinks. Dude’s wackadoodle, like a model airplane hobbyist reading Stephen Hawking on too much Adderall. He has his quirks and pet plots, but I’m always fascinated to hear his latest dispatch from the edge of sanity.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Here&#8217;s to hoping <em>Tenet</em> drove him just as nutty.</p>\n<p> <em>&#8216;Tenet&#8217; opens in theaters in the U.S. on September 3.

It was the day when the now-iconic rapper <a href=\"https://uproxx.com/music/snoop-dogg-eminem-love-top-10-rappers-list/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Snoop Dogg</a> dropped his debut album <em><a href=\"https://uproxx.com/music/snoop-dogg-doggystyle-25th-anniversary/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Doggystyle</a></em>. It’s also the day we first heard Snoop’s tribute to pot-smoking, drink sipping, and house-partying called “<a href=\"https://uproxx.com/hitfix/snoop-dogg-performs-gin-and-juice-for-a-delighted-barack-and-michelle-obama/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Gin &#38; Juice</a>.” </p>\n<p>This week, more than 25 years later, Snoop is paying homage to the classic song about the simple cocktail of <a href=\"https://uproxx.com/life/best-gins-to-drink-straight/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">gin</a> and fruit juice (usually grapefruit juice) by launching his own gin brand. It should come as no surprise that the man who set a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GWR/status/1001090490220122118?s=20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">world record</a> when he made a 500-liter gin and juice cocktail (a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradise_(cocktail)#:~:text=On%20May%2027%2C%202018%2C%20Snoop,38%20gallons)%20of%20orange%20juice.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Paradise cocktail</a> technically) back in 2018 would eventually start his own gin brand. It’s called INDOGGO, and even though it immediately makes us think of IndieGoGo, it was designed to be a “laid-back” California-style gin. </p>\n<p>It should come as no surprise that while Snoop Dogg knows an awful lot about crafting lyrics, he doesn’t know much about making gin. That’s why he partnered with Keenan Towns of Trusted Beverages &#8212; a beverage supplier known for creating celebrity <a href=\"https://uproxx.com/life/best-wine-regions-in-america/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">wine</a> and spirits brands &#8212; as well as Prestige Beverage Group to make his gin-filled dream a reality. </p>\n<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t wait for the world to taste my remix on gin,” Snoop said in a press release. “When I wrote &#8216;Gin &#38; Juice&#8217; back in &#8217;94 it was about good feelings and real experiences, it just naturally became a global anthem.” </p>\n<figure id=\"402534927\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-402534927\" src=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/The-Remix-cocktail-and-INDOGGO-bottle.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" srcset=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/The-Remix-cocktail-and-INDOGGO-bottle.jpg 1000w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/The-Remix-cocktail-and-INDOGGO-bottle.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/The-Remix-cocktail-and-INDOGGO-bottle.jpg?resize=650,434 650w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/The-Remix-cocktail-and-INDOGGO-bottle.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/The-Remix-cocktail-and-INDOGGO-bottle.jpg?resize=150,100 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span class=\"wp-media-credit\">INDOGGO</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>His goal with INDOGGO was to recreate those same feelings from 25 years ago. He did this by making a gin that was distilled five times and is smooth enough to drink on its own as it is to mix into his <a href=\"https://uproxx.com/life/best-gins-for-g-and-t/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">favorite cocktail</a>. It’s made from seven herbs and botanicals but really makes a statement by being infused with natural strawberry flavor. Unlike many gins, it doesn’t rely on a large kick of juniper to get its point across. Instead, it carries a lot of orange peel, coriander, and cassia bark flavors in an effort to make it more well-rounded. </p>\n<p>It should be noted that this isn’t Snoop Dogg’s first foray into the booze world. This summer, he collaborated with 19 Crimes Wine to launch Snoop Cali Red, a blend of Lodi-based Petite Syrah, Zinfandel, and Merlot.</p>\n<p>The wine is readily available, but the gin is set to launch this month in California only.

Hopefully still hot and crunchy, with that batter that looks sort of like a golden-yellow icicle and the sweet soy-based dipping sauce (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tentsuyu\">tentsuyu!</a>), it goes great with a nice champagne-y Japanese lager. </p> \n<p>Vegetable tempura was probably the first thing I ever ate at a Japanese restaurant as a child and I can confirm that it still rips as an adult. The batter is so good that it almost doesn’t matter what’s inside, which is probably the philosophical basis of the entire dish. But that doesn’t mean we don’t all have our favorites. And you often have to choose what you reach for, because it’s one of those dishes that everyone at the table will assume is a shareable (at least in my family, buncha god damned wolves).</p> \n<p><strong>A note on what we included</strong>: Obviously, shrimp and other seafood probably makes the best tempura. Yet you can’t just order nothing but shrimp tempura. For one, it’s kind of overkill, and for another it makes the shrimp tempura taste less good if it’s not a rare delicacy that you have to hunt for. Ordering homogeneous shrimp tempura with no veggies is like eating de-shelled pumpkin seeds — not having to work for it just doesn’t seem right. It doesn’t taste as good. </p> \n<p>In terms of actual vegetables, I’m not talking about your specialty items here either that you’d order in homogeneous form — your tempura green beans, your asparagus tempura. Both are great, but for these purposes, we’re only counting vegetables that come standard, or at least semi-standard, in your typical mixed vegetable tempura order. So don’t come in here and start asking me shit like “but Vince, what about deep-fried squash blossoms?!”</p> \n<h3><strong>1. Lotus Root</strong></h3> \n<figure id=\"402532026\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n <img class=\"size-full wp-image-402532026\" src=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/LotusRootTempura.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" srcset=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/LotusRootTempura.jpg 710w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/LotusRootTempura.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/LotusRootTempura.jpg?resize=650,488 650w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/LotusRootTempura.jpg?resize=632,474 632w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/LotusRootTempura.jpg?resize=536,402 536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 710px) 100vw, 710px\" />\n <figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">\n  <span class=\"wp-media-credit\">y-studio</span>\n </figcaption>\n</figure> \n<p>Lotus root is the king of tempura vegetables. It’s perfect. It has the root vegetable texture that’s perfect to fry, can be sliced wafer-thin, and has basically the maximum allowable surface area you could possibly get from a thinly-sliced vegetable. A fried lotus root is almost cheating. It’s the corked bat of fried vegetables. Lotus root is like a gilded potato chip that’s soft and juicy inside. If I were to design a perfect frying vegetable out of thin air I probably couldn’t do better than a lotus root. </p> \n<p>It’s like a naturally occurring bloomin’ onion. </p> \n<h3><strong>2. Sweet Potato</strong></h3> \n<p>Sweet potato comes in at number two… <em>if</em> it’s sliced thinnish, ideally not much more than an eighth-inch thick. A thinly-sliced sweet potato has that nice pumpkinny sweet flavor and beautifully soft texture inside. Too thick and they get dry and mushy. A thicker sliced sweet potato would be down at number four or five or lower. Regular potato is also great, though not common enough for the list. Yucca root is also solid, but more of a South American thing.</p> \n<h3><strong>3. Carrot</strong></h3> \n<p>Tempura carrots retain a little more snap than tempura sweet potatoes. Your mileage may vary. I definitely prefer it to a thicker sweet potato, but they admittedly don’t quite have the melt-in-your-mouth quality of sweet potatoes. I give carrots B+ for texture, A for flavor, and C for sauce retain-ability. </p> \n<h3><strong>4.

They’re moister than sweet potato with less snap than carrot. All three are kind of a wash depending on slice thickness. Like sweet potato, the thinner the better with kabocha, though the kabocha is more forgiving. It’s like a lower risk, lower reward sweet potato. </p> \n<h3><strong>5. Mushroom</strong></h3> \n<figure id=\"402532079\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n <img class=\"size-full wp-image-402532079\" src=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TempuraMushroom.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" srcset=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TempuraMushroom.jpg 710w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TempuraMushroom.jpg?resize=300,267 300w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TempuraMushroom.jpg?resize=650,580 650w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 710px) 100vw, 710px\" />\n <figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">\n  <span class=\"wp-media-credit\">Getty Image</span>\n </figcaption>\n</figure> \n<p>I love the flavor of a fried mushroom. I don’t even really care what kind. Button mushroom? Why not. Shiitake? Shiit yeah. Mushrooms lack some of the elegant simplicity of a deep-fried root vegetable and have a spongier texture, but they make up for it in the flavor department. The worst thing about tempura mushrooms, mostly in the case of white or button mushrooms, is that they tend to retain a bit of liquid, so if you don’t wait long enough, sometimes biting into one can shoot superheated 200-degree liquid right onto your soft palate.</p> \n<p> That’s a bad night. But hey, I like to live dangerously. </p> \n<h3><strong>6. Onion</strong></h3> \n<figure id=\"402532106\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n <img class=\"size-full wp-image-402532106\" src=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Onion-Tempura.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" srcset=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Onion-Tempura.jpg 710w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Onion-Tempura.jpg?resize=300,168 300w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Onion-Tempura.jpg?resize=650,363 650w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Onion-Tempura.jpg?resize=150,85 150w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Onion-Tempura.jpg?resize=196,110 196w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 710px) 100vw, 710px\" />\n <figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">\n  <span class=\"wp-media-credit\">Getty Image</span>\n </figcaption>\n</figure> \n<p>Honestly, onions could go a lot higher. They fry up beautifully, and they’re sweet, soft, <em>and</em> moist inside. The full trifecta. Gimme a nice <em>thicc</em> one, save that skinny stuff for your hamburgers and string bean casseroles. The only thing holding tempura onions back on this list is their own ubiquity. You don’t need to order tempura to experience a nice battered onion ring (battered &gt; breaded, do not dispute me on this). </p> \n<p>Victims of their own success, really.</p> \n<h3><strong>7. Cauliflower</strong></h3> \n<p>Cauliflower is like sturdier broccoli and it makes a great frying vegetable. Ever had buffalo cauliflower? Wonderful (though again, it better be breaded. Don’t you dare try to pass off some non-breaded nonsense as buffalo cauliflower). It makes a great tempura vegetable for the same reasons. While they lack the texture of a root veg, and the flavor of roots or mushrooms, they somewhat make up for it in superior dunkability. Those florets are great for soaking up sauce (mom joke goes here). </p> \n<h3><strong>8. Broccoli</strong></h3> \n<p>Is it controversial to put broccoli below cauliflower? It’s not as moist or as tender as cauliflower and the florets are more delicate so they don’t stand up to deep frying quite as well. I’d also argue that broccoli is a little stinkier. Still, absolute A+ sauce retention and best-in-class dunkability. </p> \n<h3><strong>9. Bell Pepper</strong></h3> \n<p>If this was Rotten Tomatoes, I’d put the thumb’s up/thumb’s down line right above bell pepper. I mean, they’re fine. I’m not going to throw a deep-fried bell pepper out of bed. But green bell peppers are often used as filler, and never more so than in vegetable tempura. If you want to stuff it with something (rice, meat, whatever), or swap it out for jalapeño… <em>now</em> we’re talking. Plain fried bell pepper though? Solid “meh.” </p> \n<h3><strong>10. Zucchini</strong></h3> \n<p>I don’t get zucchini. Is it a cucumber? Is it an eggplant? Is it like if a cucumber f*cked an eggplant? Why does the texture seem to be the same cooked or uncooked? How do you even know if it’s done? Why do people keep trying to put it in muffins? A zucchini muffin at least makes more sense than zucchini tempura. Zucchini is (are?) too moist to fry well and they just end up soft and rubbery (dad joke goes here). </p> \n<p>I don’t know that I <em>hate</em> zucchini, but I sure don’t understand it. </p> \n<h3><strong>11. Eggplant</strong></h3> \n<p>Eggplant has its place. I love a baba ghanoush. An eggplant parmesan. A nice moussaka. The Indians do incredible work with it. It’s creamy and it takes nicely to a sauce and some spice. But let’s face it: eggplant sucks as tempura. It’s too moist, not sturdy enough, and too bland. It usually turns into a mushy, soggy, mess. I vote NO on eggplant tempura. At least until I’ve already eaten all the other vegetables.</p> \n<p><em>Vince Mancini is on</em><a href=\"http://twitter.com/vincemancini\"> <em>Twitter</em></a><em>.

In 2020, Beyond Meat has developed a considerable edge over Impossible Foods as the brand has become to go-to meat 2.0 choice of the majority of chains, but from a flavor standpoint? </p>\n<p>We&#8217;re a little <a title=\"\" href=\"https://uproxx.com/life/impossible-burger-vs-beyond-meat-burger-taste/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">more convinced</a> of Impossible&#8217;s <a title=\"\" href=\"https://uproxx.com/life/livestock-meat-and-dairy-major-contributors-climate-change/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">meat-mimicking power</a> over Beyond&#8217;s tech. Though we fully recognize that that is totally in the hands of who is preparing the thing. For instance, Umami Burger&#8217;s Impossible Burger and the Impossible Whopper couldn&#8217;t taste more different. That&#8217;s good news because both Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods are now more available at grocery stores than they&#8217;ve ever been, allowing you to put your own culinary stamp on a plant-based burger if fast food isn&#8217;t your thing.</p>\n<p>Regardless, we&#8217;ve got you covered if you&#8217;re enjoying more meals at home (due to COVID-19, this is all of us) with an updated list of all the markets and online stores, as well as nationwide fast-food joints holding both Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods.

released before <a href=\"https://uproxx.com/movies/chadwick-boseman-dead/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">his death</a> was <em>Da 5 Bloods</em>, Spike Lee’s reliably ambitious take on the Vietnam War genre. Boseman played one of the titular “Bloods,” a group of veterans who planted caches of money all over the war-torn country, with plans to retrieve it decades later. But his character, known as “Stormin’ Norm,” is only seen in flashbacks, being the only one to die during the war — a touch that’s gained unintended resonance after his untimely death. It seems Boseman kept his colon cancer a secret from almost the entire industry — to the point that one of his <em>Da 5 Bloods</em> co-stars misjudged his behavior as arrogance, when it certainly was not.</p>\n<p>The actor is Clarke Peters, perhaps best known as an alum of both <em>The Wire</em> (as intelligence expert Lester Freamon) and <em>Treme</em>. He played Otis, perhaps the calmest of the quintet, who reunites with his old Vietnamese girlfriend, and the daughter he didn’t know he had. But while making the movie, Peters admitted, on a recent interview with <em>Good Morning Britain</em> (<a href=\"https://ew.com/movies/clarke-peters-regrets-judging-chadwick-boseman-da-5-bloods/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">as caught by <em>Entertainment Weekly</em></a>), he didn’t get along as well with Boseman as he wished he’d had, especially once he learned about his condition. (You can watch the interview below.)</p>\n<div class=\"iframe-holder\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">We all can learn a lesson in this&#8230; <a href=\"https://t.co/1LyQ67nSJ0\">pic.twitter.com/1LyQ67nSJ0</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Loni Love (@LoniLove) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LoniLove/status/1300855409217957888?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 1, 2020</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div>\n<p>&#8220;I have to say with a little bit of regret that I probably wasn’t the most altruistic in that environment, but hindsight teaches us a lot of things,” Peters said on the show. &#8220;What I&#8217;m addressing is, basically, my wife asked what Chadwick was like. I was really excited to work with him. I said, &#8216;I think he&#8217;s a little bit precious.&#8217; And she said, &#8216;Why?&#8217; And I said, &#8216;Because he&#8217;s surrounded by people who are fawning over him.&#8217; He has a Chinese practitioner, who is massaging his back when he walks off set. He has a makeup lady massaging his feet. His girlfriend is there holding his hand.</p>\n<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;m thinking maybe the <em>Black Panther</em> thing went to his head.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It hadn’t. Boseman wasn’t acting princely; he was, Peters and everyone now knows, battling an illness that would soon take his life. “I regret even having those thoughts because they were really looking after him,” Peters said, choking back tears.</p>\n<p>It’s a heartbreaking reminder that Boseman kept his illness very close to the chest, right up to the end. There’s still one more Boseman film left to be released: <em>Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom</em>, which Netflix will drop later this year.</p>\n<p>(Via <em><a href=\"https://ew.com/movies/clarke-peters-regrets-judging-chadwick-boseman-da-5-bloods/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">EW</a></em>)</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?a=ek8Z8-bXL7g:i7QHwjChEvQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?a=ek8Z8-bXL7g:i7QHwjChEvQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?i=ek8Z8-bXL7g:i7QHwjChEvQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?a=ek8Z8-bXL7g:i7QHwjChEvQ:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?a=ek8Z8-bXL7g:i7QHwjChEvQ:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?a=ek8Z8-bXL7g:i7QHwjChEvQ:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?i=ek8Z8-bXL7g:i7QHwjChEvQ:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/uproxx/features/~4/ek8Z8-bXL7g\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 03 Sep 2020 01:06:59 +0000","feedId":6617,"bgimg":"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/da-5-bloods-boseman-wide.jpeg?w=1024&h=449&crop=1","linkMd5":"8b03d423a1ad224b3635b1739f0ecf57","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn46@2020_6/2020/09/04/17-11-02-693_bb8e58b8489917f0.webp","destWidth":1024,"destHeight":449,"sourceBytes":102020,"destBytes":102020,"author":"matthewprigge","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/da-5-bloods-boseman-wide.jpeg?w=1024&h=449&crop=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn46@2020_6/2020/09/04/17-11-02-693_bb8e58b8489917f0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn89@2020_5/2020/09/04/17-11-02-428_c8fa5e32ae89b18f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?i=ek8Z8-bXL7g:i7QHwjChEvQ:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn68@2020_4/2020/09/04/17-11-20-499_5b78ee1206684a0b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn45@2020_2/2020/09/04/17-11-18-942_f1234b5e3acb72a6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?i=ek8Z8-bXL7g:i7QHwjChEvQ:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn44@2020_4/2020/09/04/17-11-19-551_258b139eb5e3d386.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/uproxx/features/~4/ek8Z8-bXL7g":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn36@2020_4/2020/09/04/17-11-16-451_da56671a4c81c4c0.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599239462318},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 01:11:02","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 01:11:02","title":"‘Mission: Impossible 7’ Is Now Stirring Up Controversy In Norway Over The Use Of Cruise Ships","link":"https://uproxx.com/?p=402534745","description":"\t<div class=\"featured-image\">\n\t\t<figure class=\"post-thumbnail\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"upx-component upx-image\"><div class=\"image-holder\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"660\" src=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/tom-cruise-mission.jpg?w=1600&#38;h=660&#38;crop=1\" class=\"attachment-article-featured size-article-featured skip-lazy\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/tom-cruise-mission.jpg?resize=1200,495 1200w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/tom-cruise-mission.jpg?resize=1600,660 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) calc(100vw - 20px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 40px), (min-width: 1025px) 1024px, 1024px\" /></div></div><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span class=\"wp-media-credit\">PARAMOUNT</span></figcaption>\t\t</figure>\n\t</div>\n\t<p>Another week, and another controversy for the <em><a href=\"https://uproxx.com/tag/mission-impossible-7/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mission: Impossible 7</a></em> production as it pushes through Europe to completion.</p>\n<p>This time, the <a href=\"https://uproxx.com/topic/tom-cruise/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tom Cruise</a> spy thriller finds itself in hot water after renting a pair of cruise ships in Norway. According to reports, at least one of the boats will serve as a &#8220;hotel-ship&#8221; for the cast and crew, but there is no official confirmation on their intended use. However, the more concerning issue is that the production is allegedly violating the Norwegian Immigration act by using the ships&#8217; underpaid Filipino crews. The move has put Cruise and the filmmaking team in the crosshairs of two local labor unions. </p>\n<p>Via <a href=\"https://variety.com/2020/film/global/tom-cruise-mission-impossible-norway-1234756626/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Variety</em></a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“It is completely unsustainable that it should be possible to only dock a boat with a wage level down to NOK 29 [$3.30] per hour,” union leader Johnny Hansen told the Norwegian Seamen’s Association.</p>\n<p>“It is not okay to use a ship that is to go in international shipping as a hotel in Stryn, close your eyes, and hope no one will find out that the employees are not close to the pay and working conditions that are statutory,” Fellesforbund leader Jørn Eggum told Verdens Gang.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Back in July, Cruise personally <a href=\"https://uproxx.com/movies/tom-cruise-mission-impossible-7-norway-resume-filming/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">called Norway&#8217;s Culture Minister</a> in an effort to jumpstart <em>Mission: Impossible 7</em>&#8216;s paused production as quickly as possible, so it remains to be seen whether this controversy will cause friction with government officials after allowing the film into the European country. The labor issue also arrives on the heels of trouble in Poland where the production faced criticism over its plan to blow up a bridge. Media headlines claimed the bridge scheduled to be detonated was a &#8220;<a href=\"https://uproxx.com/movies/christopher-mcquarrie-mission-impossible-7-bridge-poland/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">national monument</a>,&#8221; but director Ralph McQuarrie set the record straight in an open letter. According to McQuarrie, the bridge had no historic value, and local officials were enthusiastic about the production doing the local economy a favor by removing it, so a new one could be built to increase tourism.</p>\n<p>(Via <a href=\"https://variety.com/2020/film/global/tom-cruise-mission-impossible-norway-1234756626/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Variety</em></a>)</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?a=2D-NV_sVYFk:l8haaHvARAw:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?a=2D-NV_sVYFk:l8haaHvARAw:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?i=2D-NV_sVYFk:l8haaHvARAw:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?a=2D-NV_sVYFk:l8haaHvARAw:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?a=2D-NV_sVYFk:l8haaHvARAw:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?a=2D-NV_sVYFk:l8haaHvARAw:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?i=2D-NV_sVYFk:l8haaHvARAw:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/uproxx/features/~4/2D-NV_sVYFk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Sep 2020 16:53:16 +0000","feedId":6617,"bgimg":"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/tom-cruise-mission.jpg?w=1600&h=660&crop=1","linkMd5":"22052d2eb0cc3a3f8cb813a000c8067f","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn78@2020_2/2020/09/04/17-11-02-626_44b5682d7428b79a.webp","destWidth":1600,"destHeight":660,"sourceBytes":122620,"destBytes":122620,"author":"Mike Redmond","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/tom-cruise-mission.jpg?w=1600&h=660&crop=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn78@2020_2/2020/09/04/17-11-02-626_44b5682d7428b79a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn89@2020_5/2020/09/04/17-11-02-428_c8fa5e32ae89b18f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?i=2D-NV_sVYFk:l8haaHvARAw:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn81@2020_3/2020/09/04/17-11-21-399_3f3d39161b447605.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn45@2020_2/2020/09/04/17-11-18-942_f1234b5e3acb72a6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?i=2D-NV_sVYFk:l8haaHvARAw:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn15@2020_4/2020/09/04/17-11-16-599_d7073c38be2e6728.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/uproxx/features/~4/2D-NV_sVYFk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn12@2020_3/2020/09/04/17-11-17-913_21973c442b365eae.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599239462318},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 01:11:02","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 01:11:02","title":"Ken Jennings Will Appear On New ‘Jeopardy!’ Episodes But Alex Trebek Is Still Hosting","link":"https://uproxx.com/?p=402537219","description":"\t<div class=\"featured-image\">\n\t\t<figure class=\"post-thumbnail\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"upx-component upx-image\"><div class=\"image-holder\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"471\" src=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/jenningstrophy1024.jpg?w=1024&#38;h=471&#38;crop=1\" class=\"attachment-article-featured size-article-featured skip-lazy\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/jenningstrophy1024.jpg 1024w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/jenningstrophy1024.jpg?resize=300,138 300w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/jenningstrophy1024.jpg?resize=650,299 650w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/jenningstrophy1024.jpg?resize=768,353 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) calc(100vw - 20px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 40px), (min-width: 1025px) 1024px, 1024px\" /></div></div><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span class=\"wp-media-credit\">Getty Image</span></figcaption>\t\t</figure>\n\t</div>\n\t<p>After months on the shelf thanks to the still-ongoing coronavirus pandemic, <em><a href=\"https://uproxx.com/topic/jeopardy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jeopardy!</a></em> is <a href=\"https://uproxx.com/tv/jeopardy-return-date-season-37-alex-trebek/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">finally back to taping episodes</a>.

It’s full of vanilla, caramel, and corn-sweetness and is effortlessly easy to sip. But, the best thing about starting with <a href=\"https://uproxx.com/life/bourbons-for-summer-and-fall/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bourbon</a> from the Loretto, Kentucky-based <a href=\"https://uproxx.com/life/eh-taylor-jr-single-barrel-tasting/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">distillery</a> is the fact that you can step up to its other releases when your palate becomes a little more nuanced. </p>\n<p>You can’t go wrong with its Maker’s Mark 46. But the true <a href=\"https://uproxx.com/life/most-underrated-bourbons-2020/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bourbon</a> aficionados always eagerly await their second release, Maker’ Mark 2020 Limited Release. This is the second offering from its Wood Finishing series. Last year, the brand launched Stave Profile RC6. It was full of toasted vanilla, sweet caramel, and mouth-watering fruit flavors. This year, at the same time the brand is celebrating the 10th anniversary of Maker’s 46, it’s making this new release available. </p>\n<p>You might be unfamiliar with the term “wood finishing.” In this scenario, it refers to Maker&#8217;s proprietary stave finishing process. After full maturation, cask strength bourbon is filled into barrels containing specifically designed wooden staves. Then, those barrels are rested in the brand’s limestone bourbon cellar. The result is a unique flavor profile created by the well-aged whiskey and the staves interacting together. </p>\n<p>Available now nationwide, Maker’s Mark 2020 Limited Release has a suggested retail price of $59.99 &#8212; a great price for what&#8217;s in the bottle. It won’t be available for long, so you better get your hands on a bottle while you can. </p>\n<h3>Maker’s Mark 2020 Limited Release</h3>\n<figure id=\"402534612\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-402534612\" src=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/WFS2020-Bridge.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" srcset=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/WFS2020-Bridge.jpg 4128w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/WFS2020-Bridge.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/WFS2020-Bridge.jpg?resize=650,433 650w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/WFS2020-Bridge.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/WFS2020-Bridge.jpg?resize=1024,683 1024w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/WFS2020-Bridge.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/WFS2020-Bridge.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/WFS2020-Bridge.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/WFS2020-Bridge.jpg?resize=1920,1280 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 4128px) 100vw, 4128px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span class=\"wp-media-credit\">Maker</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p><strong>ABV: </strong>55.4%<br />\n<strong>Price:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.makersmark.com/wood-finishing-series-2020-release\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">$59.99</a></p>\n<p><strong>The Story:</strong></p>\n<p>Proving that you need to compare both offerings, last year’s expression was created to be high in baking spices and fruity flavors. This year, the emphasis was richer, more dessert-like flavors. That’s because the 2020 version doesn’t use the same stave styles from the previous year. They selected the two specific staves to impart the flavors of vanilla and caramel. They didn’t figure out how to do this overnight. It took more than a year of experimenting before they created the perfect balance. One stave, made from French oak, was cooked on medium heat before toasting. The other stave was made from American oak. It was cooked on low heat for an extended period of time. The vast difference in the flavor of the two offerings makes us wonder what we’re in store for next fall. </p>\n<p><strong>Tasting Notes:</strong></p>\n<p>Like all great bourbon sipping sessions, it all starts with the nosing. You’d be remiss if you took a sip without first savoring the aromas of rich, toasted oak, sweet cream, and salted caramel. The first sip brings forth flavors of vanilla beans, sticky toffee pudding, and caramelized sugar with a subtle nutty backbone. The finish is long, dry, and ripe with more vanilla and caramel that ends with a subtle flourish of cinnamon. </p>\n<p><strong>Bottom Line:</strong></p>\n<p>The folks at Maker’s Mark spent a long time perfecting this whiskey. You should do it justice by pouring it over a few ice cubes and sipping it slowly while you watch the world go by around you. Its September launch is well-timed because this will be your go-to autumnal dram.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?a=iNw7j_MNYg0:AlINTS2ftgE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?a=iNw7j_MNYg0:AlINTS2ftgE:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?i=iNw7j_MNYg0:AlINTS2ftgE:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?a=iNw7j_MNYg0:AlINTS2ftgE:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?a=iNw7j_MNYg0:AlINTS2ftgE:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?a=iNw7j_MNYg0:AlINTS2ftgE:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?i=iNw7j_MNYg0:AlINTS2ftgE:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/uproxx/features/~4/iNw7j_MNYg0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Sep 2020 21:14:51 +0000","feedId":6617,"bgimg":"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/makers-tfeat-uproxx.jpg?w=1600&h=495&crop=1","linkMd5":"ceadd35d6ae8525e532b85e010aac965","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn41@2020_4/2020/09/04/17-11-02-872_0cc002bb1a74556d.webp","destWidth":1600,"destHeight":495,"sourceBytes":480492,"destBytes":480492,"author":"christopherosburn","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/makers-tfeat-uproxx.jpg?w=1600&h=495&crop=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn41@2020_4/2020/09/04/17-11-02-872_0cc002bb1a74556d.webp","https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/WFS2020-Bridge.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn93@2020_3/2020/09/04/17-11-23-655_8f4955ba218daf5b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn89@2020_5/2020/09/04/17-11-02-428_c8fa5e32ae89b18f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?i=iNw7j_MNYg0:AlINTS2ftgE:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn25@2020_4/2020/09/04/17-11-23-157_8ea8eec12d366707.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn45@2020_2/2020/09/04/17-11-18-942_f1234b5e3acb72a6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/uproxx/features?i=iNw7j_MNYg0:AlINTS2ftgE:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn71@2020_3/2020/09/04/17-11-15-488_d54f175e719c1b7d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/uproxx/features/~4/iNw7j_MNYg0":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn16@2020_3/2020/09/04/17-11-21-539_2ec8ff4e2316e8d2.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599239462317},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 01:11:02","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 01:11:02","title":"SNX DLX: Featuring The Jordan 1 Bio Hack, Jaden Smith’s New Balances, And A Rhude Puma Collab","link":"https://uproxx.com/?p=402534725","description":"\t<div class=\"featured-image\">\n\t\t<figure class=\"post-thumbnail\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"upx-component upx-image\"><div class=\"image-holder\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"495\" src=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/snx-tfeat-uproxx.jpg?w=1600&#38;h=495&#38;crop=1\" class=\"attachment-article-featured size-article-featured skip-lazy\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/snx-tfeat-uproxx.jpg 1600w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/snx-tfeat-uproxx.jpg?resize=300,93 300w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/snx-tfeat-uproxx.jpg?resize=650,201 650w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/snx-tfeat-uproxx.jpg?resize=768,238 768w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/snx-tfeat-uproxx.jpg?resize=1024,317 1024w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/snx-tfeat-uproxx.jpg?resize=1536,475 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) calc(100vw - 20px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 40px), (min-width: 1025px) 1024px, 1024px\" /></div></div><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span class=\"wp-media-credit\">Puma/Nike/New Balance/Uproxx</span></figcaption>\t\t</figure>\n\t</div>\n\t<p>Hello September! We&#8217;re now officially in the last days of summer and even if it&#8217;s still unseasonably warm outside in some parts of the county, it&#8217;s time to start seriously thinking about <a title=\"\" href=\"https://uproxx.com/style/stich-gawd-interview/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">layering up</a>. We got you in that department. </p>\n<p>But before we dive into this week&#8217;s SNX DLX, we should probably mention that <a title=\"\" href=\"https://uproxx.com/style/where-to-buy-sean-wotherspoon-adidas-superearth-superstar-union-jordan-4-guava/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">one of our picks from last week</a>, the Adidas YEEZY 700 V3 Arzareth, was postponed (along with a lot of other Adidas releases) as a company-wide call for justice over the shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin. </p>\n<p>The Arzareth&#8217;s adjusted launch date was September 1st. And the sneaker is still available over at Yeezy Supply. Still, it didn&#8217;t feel right to include the sneaker in this week&#8217;s lineup again. This week we&#8217;ve got new releases from New Balance, Adidas, a Dunk-inspired Air Jordan 1, and a linkup between Puma and streetwear label Rhude.

But, I don’t know. I think Jaden’s work with New Balance is pretty dope. The Vision Racer is a mashup of New Balance’s 1700 and X-Racer silhouettes and features an upper of mixed mesh and suede, reflective detailing along the New Balance “N,” and a mix of recycled and post-consumer plastic construction throughout.</p>\n<p>Did we mention this sneaker is also fully vegan-friendly? You can roll your eyes, but then fix them to the fact that our planet is on fire. Who wouldn’t want a vegan semi-sustainable sneaker in 2020?</p>\n<p>The Jaden Smith x New Balance Vision Racer Wavy White is out now for a retail price of $150.
