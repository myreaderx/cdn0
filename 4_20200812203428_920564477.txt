DiMartino’s <a href=\"https://www.michaeldantedimartino.com/an-open-letter-to-avatar-the-last-airbender-fans/\">lengthy blog post</a> only confirmed those concerns, as the writer and executive producer noted that “whatever version ends up on-screen, it will not be what Bryan and I had envisioned or intended to make.” Both DiMartino and Konietzko cited creative differences with Netflix over the direction of the project.
