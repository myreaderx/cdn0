Video shows the V-22s GAU-17 M134 minigun attached to the belly of he chopper.<br><br>The system is named DWS and is remotely operated and incorporates a gunner station, targeting sensor and the GAU-17 minigun. <br><br>It is designed to provide suppressive defensive fire, proficiency with this weapon system increases the readiness for the Marines of VMM-268. <br><br>he AWG-35(V) Defense Weapon System (DWS) is the U.S. Marine Corps version of BAE Systems’ Remote Guardian System (RGS). Since 2008, DWS has provided the Marines with maximum protection from threats near the landing zone, giving the V-22 aircraft its critical self-defense capability. The DWS is a mission configurable, crew-served, Night Vision Device (NVD) compatible system that is located in the cabin area. The system is remotely operated by a non-pilot crew member and has the capability to provide suppressive fire to engage troops and light armored vehicles with its maximum sustained rate of fire.<br><br>DWS provides crew safety and security at the maximum allowable coverage in all quadrants at the maximum range of the weapon. The system has the ability to retract within the aircraft’s structure when not employed. The current implementation is operated with the GAU-17, 7.62mm mini-gun. DWS is designed for straightforward and intuitive operation.<br><br>DWS is a mission kit that is designed to minimize aircraft modifications and intrusions into the cabin area. Rather than be permanently installed on the aircraft, the kit is capable of being removed when not in use. It provides maximum fields of fire in both V-22 aircraft and helicopter modes. DWS supplies the Marines with a critical value chain of reconnaissance to weapon engagement.<br><br>The major subsystems of DWS are:<br><br>- Weapon Control Computer (WCC): Provides aircraft interface and generates the inertial stabilization signals for sensor Line of Sight (LOS) and for gun line control.<br><br>-Motor Control Unit (MCU): Supplies motor drive inverters in one enclosure in order to power the four motor drives in the turret.<br><br>-Power Distribution Unit (PDU): Provides distribution of power to the DWS subsystems.<br><br>-Transformer Rectifier Unit (TRU): Rectifies 115VAC 400Hz aircraft power.<br>Sensor: The sensor is an eight-inch stabilized turreted ball that has Charge Coupled Device (CCD) and Infra-Red (IR) modes for target detection and recognition up to 6,500 meters.<br><br>-Sensor Deploy Module (SDM): Deployment of the sensor from the forward cargo hook area.<br><br>-Gunner Control Station (Display and Controller): Sunlight readable and Night Vision Device (NVD) compatible for full system control and operation; provides the straightforward and intuitive human-machine interface.<br><br>-Weapon Turret: Deployment of the weapon from the aft cargo hook area providing 360˚ continuous rotation for maximum area suppression of the weapon range.<br><br>-Video Recorder (VR): Small, lightweight, self-contained, digital mission data recorder; utilizes a simple, digital Removable Memory Module (RMM) providing more than three hours of data recording.<br><br>-The Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey is an American multi-mission, tiltrotor military aircraft with both vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL), and short takeoff and landing (STOL) capabilities. It is designed to combine the functionality of a conventional helicopter with the long-range, high-speed cruise performance of a turboprop aircraft.<br><br>WarLeaks - Military Blog covers events, news, missions & facts from the United States Armed Forces including the U.S. Army, U.S. Navy,  U.S. Marine Corps, Air Force, Coast Guard and more!
