But there is one feature which I felt they needed, A group listening feature. Just when I started to work on it, they released a beta version of the feature. After looking into it, I felt that the feature has room for improvement and I had some ideas in my mind. Considering Spotify’s trajectory towards a more audio-focused content more than just music, such interactive features can add up to their usage and give an edge over the competitors.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*TTRBPCmi95lPeJPYRuw1-Q.png\" /></figure><p>The redesign will be presented on 4 stages<br><strong>1. Discovery<br>2. Definition <br>3. Exploration <br>4. Execution</strong></p><p><strong>Discovery</strong>: Identifying the problem. Which is, <br><strong>“The Group Session Feature on Spotify is not clear, well known, and has some experience troubles which I am aiming to solve”<br></strong>I went on to get an outside perspective. First I used the method of “<strong>Targeted User Group</strong>” questionnaire, in which I asked a specific set of questions to 10 of my friends whom I know use Spotify in various ways.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*7TiOakbutFNYP6D16XuvJQ.png\" /></figure><p>These results provided some valuable information,<br><strong>1. On how I can work on solving the problem. <br>2. Some of the issues the feature might face.<br>3. The User Groups who will be primarily using the feature<br>4. The number of people who can use it.<br>5. Other Underlying issues.</strong></p><p>The next research was to get a more large scale data on some of the questions to solidify my case. I used Instagram Polls for this research.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*9izXBw6j01m_2WFKPROvZg.png\" /><figcaption>The number of votes varies for each question, almost all of them were around 90–100 people</figcaption></figure><p>This research was mainly done to get 4 answers, concluding that…<br><strong>1. A good amount of people find it hard to access their profile page<br>2. Many people are fine with other people looking at their music activity<br>3. Almost 80% of the voters didn’t know that this feature exists<br>4. The average number of people in the Session was voted to be around 8</strong></p><p>This information helps identify the User Group who will be using the app from which the Personas can be derived.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*tucJJClpbRL9U3ifPC-oFA.png\" /></figure><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*CE1t0Y2ityuRSTmj_pKzVA.png\" /></figure><p>The research and analysis provided an insight into the pain points and navigation problems.</p><p><strong>Definition</strong>: The problem at its base is that the Group Session doesn’t seem right. But why? I have identified 3 key issues.</p><p><strong>Part 1: To start a Group Session on Spotify.</strong></p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*_8VuANqbYVnBEwzLqPUxAw.png\" /></figure><p><strong>Part 2: Entering a Group Session after getting an invite.</strong></p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*YeZVCcZDIti2WkpvjGfTaA.png\" /></figure><p><strong>Part 3: The Underlying Issues.<br>(Making Profile Page useful and the Private Session visible)</strong></p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Xo505-BXB5x6aRv6cHBK3w.png\" /></figure><p>The issues, pain points have been identified and listed below</p><p><strong>1.Location of the button for Group Session.<br>2. A better way to Invite people into the session.<br>3. Logistics of entering the Group Session.<br>4. The option of making the Session controlled by one user or multiple is given to the person entering the session<br>5. Control on the songs in a group.<br>6. Making the Group Session Tab more evident.<br>7. Making the profile more live.<br>8. Keep ‘Private Session’ in a more prominent place.</strong></p><p><strong>Exploration: </strong>After identifying the issues, I worked on analyzing the other apps and products which were similar to the experience I was looking for.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*nVOYi-ZrAuZKJlCXX8nM4g.png\" /></figure><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*wXWdvomXMyULjvVrsjY4Xg.png\" /></figure><p>JQBX player was an important case study for me to learn how a third-party app uses Spotify to stream songs. It had a lot of interesting features with some issues. But the inspiration study proved fruitful and the next stage will be exploring the options on how to redesign the Group Session.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*uHc1gH5ardfKUkOQ6zfDNA.png\" /><figcaption>Most of the brainstorming and sketches were derived from the User Research, Pain Points, and Inspirations and thus creating wireframes.</figcaption></figure><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*GuG7-ikdQloQLwIJs7h_Yw.png\" /></figure><p>This wireframe was tested among people who use the app regularly for any minor errors and suggestions. After noticing where all they felt difficult and which were the major issues among them, some changes were made and then finally, evolved as a high fidelity version which will be displayed.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*YbcxH8suhLAOkYCxF1qtxA.png\" /></figure><p>The final design cannot be explained as a single solution, but multiple solutions which go hand in hand and are interlinked. Broadly to explain, the solutions can be categorized into tasks. These tasks provide a run-through on how the design works. Some conditions to be remembered are, not all navigations have been covered as I haven’t redesigned anything else other than the aforementioned changes, This Spotify ‘Group Session’ feature still applies only for Premium members.</p><p><strong>Task 1:</strong> Creating a ‘Group Session’ in the redesigned version of the app.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*fTYGZKnPyXzBjIq2x3nPOQ.gif\" /></figure><p>Some of the previous elements have been retained like, sharing the link of the session in other apps, most of the visual style. But for easier accessibility and usage of the feature, a shortcut to this is provided directly on the home screen along with one for profile and settings. For now, <strong>10 people</strong> is the limit for the session but can change depending upon the need. But what are the two options in a group session? What do they mean?</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*N6yqO4A_70fFVg2COByDTQ.png\" /></figure><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*NV8RuY8c1uE8lhVPvou59Q.png\" /><figcaption>Icon design for the respective navigations, making it easy to access.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Task 2:</strong> Accepting an invitation when it arrives from the person who sent it.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*AJiLT07dk_bAsQMYC7Q8jg.gif\" /></figure><p>Depending on the response, one can enter immediately, later at a disclosed time, or reject the invitation.</p><p><strong>Task 3:</strong> Adding songs to the playlist queue.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*CjL87xvJ0CrS3rNPHxJ_eg.gif\" /></figure><p>Adding songs to the queue can either be accessed by pressing the ‘Add Songs’ in the playlist section of the tab or can go directly to a location of a song and click ‘more’ and add it to the queue.</p><p><strong>Task 4:</strong> Texting in the app and sharing song excerpts.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*H3qzkIik-zobmi3qJI8XRg.gif\" /></figure><p>Texting in the app is accessed in the group session tab, the messages won’t disturb the flow of the song through unwanted notifications, but will be appearing in the chatbox like a thread. Excerpts of songs can be shared to be added to the queue or can be suggested. This feature is mainly added to coordinate between the members and discuss songs, podcasts, and even life.</p><p><strong>Task 5:</strong> Leaving and exiting a Group session.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*fxffKjYUajOFROM8BkVZ2Q.gif\" /></figure><p>Leaving a session is simple and straight forward, with a button existing in the tab itself, near the part of people in the session.</p><p><strong>Task 6:</strong> Private session and profile redesign.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*B9jg7zvRGH9adMrYITWNRg.gif\" /></figure><p>Not exactly related to the Group session, but is a feature that will be indirectly affected by the Group session. When group listening becomes a more prevalent feature, profile activity becomes higher and people might want to prefer privacy. Thus the private session is more accessible. Another minor change is to differentiate artists and people in the following for easier identifications.</p><p><strong>Task 7:</strong> Underlaying changes for Settings tab and Search tab.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*9_BYrPgpytHMAQmzTwSp-A.gif\" /></figure><p>Both of these changes are slightly minor but help in reducing time spent in scrolling and searching for specific info, navigation, or a profile.</p><p>All these redesigns have been made mostly adhering to the existing Spotify app and all the UI elements that have been designed are inspired by the existing icons.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*FBBDNBQevsKGgicmbK-gBg.jpeg\" /></figure><p>The group session is one feature that I believe has the potential to evolve into a more widespread group listening feature and also provide creators an opportunity to share their music live and also maybe pave the way for the future of concerts in this pandemic situation. But as a start, listening to good music or informative podcasts and discussing them will pave a new way of entertainment and also make work more productive considering work from home is becoming the norm.</p><p><em>Here ends my case study on how the Group listening feature in Spotify can be redesigned. Thank you for coming this far. This is my first full-scale project on a User Experience problem. I have been using Spotify since it released in India and I personally love the app. I also like listening to songs together with my friends. Thus I felt like I had to provide a solution for this feature on the app. Since this is one of my first projects, I might have made some small errors or discrepancies, if so please feel free to inform me. I am open to any constructive feedback, upon which I can improve my process and outputs as I work on more projects.</em></p><img
