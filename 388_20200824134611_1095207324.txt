The initial version of Realme UI is based on Android 10, while the upcoming second generation of the skin <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/download-realme-x50-pro-first-android-11-beta-1-build-realme-ui/\">should be integrated on top of Android 11</a>. Android purists might not like Realme&#8217;s take on the operating system, but the OEM does offer a plethora of additional features and behavior changes through their custom user interface that you won’t find in stock Android. One such feature is &#8220;Smooth Scrolling&#8221;, which is now being gradually rolled out to a number of Realme smartphones.</p>\n<p>According to the company, users will experience &#8220;a visually smoother, faster effect when scrolling content downwards or upwards&#8221; after enabling the <em>Smooth Scrolling</em> option. The implementation feels more like a software emulated fluid scroll animation which takes effect as soon as you start to scroll within an app. Due to such a design, the accelerated effect is more recognizable when you&#8217;re going through an infinite scroll feed, like the one on Facebook or Twitter.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-326769 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/realme_ui_smooth_scrolling.gif\" alt=\"realme_ui_smooth_scrolling\" width=\"400\" height=\"402\" /></p>\n<p>As of now, the <em>Smooth Scrolling</em> toggle can be found under Settings=&#62;realme Lab, which means the OEM has yet to mark it as a stable feature. For those not familiar with the concept of &#8220;Realme Lab&#8221;, it is a special module of Realme UI through which the company conducts pilot tests of work-in-progress OS functionalities by real life users. Based on the feedback over time, Realme will permanently fuse the feature with the underlying OS, although we don&#8217;t know anything concrete about the timeline.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-326775 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/realme_ui_smooth_scrolling_option.jpg\" alt=\"realme_ui_smooth_scrolling_option\" width=\"480\" height=\"483\" srcset=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/realme_ui_smooth_scrolling_option.jpg 480w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/realme_ui_smooth_scrolling_option-298x300.jpg 298w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/realme_ui_smooth_scrolling_option-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /></p>\n<p>Here’s the full list of devices that have received the <em>Smooth Scrolling</em> feature so far:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://forum.xda-developers.com/realme-xt\">Realme XT</a> (software version <a href=\"https://c.realme.com/in/post-details/1290628552307245056\">RMX1921EX_11.C.06</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://forum.xda-developers.com/realme-x\">Realme X</a> (software version <a href=\"https://c.realme.com/in/post-details/1290627637009448960\">RMX1901EX_11.C.05</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://forum.xda-developers.com/realme-x2\">Realme X2</a> (software version <a href=\"https://c.realme.com/in/post-details/1288643419521941504\">RMX1992EX_11.C.11 / RMX1992AEX_11.C.11</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://forum.xda-developers.com/realme-x3\">Realme X3</a> and <a href=\"https://forum.xda-developers.com/x3-superzoom\">Realme X3 SuperZoom</a> (software version <a href=\"https://c.realme.com/in/post-details/1290652303195373568\">RMX2081PU_11.A.39</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://forum.xda-developers.com/realme-3-pro\">Realme 3 Pro</a> (software version <a href=\"https://c.realme.com/in/post-details/1288814908061777920\">RMX1851EX_11.C.07</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://forum.xda-developers.com/realme-5-pro\">Realme 5 Pro</a> (software version <a href=\"https://c.realme.com/in/post-details/1288992101932990464\">RMX1971EX_11.C.05</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source: <a href=\"https://c.realme.com/in/post-details/1290873951878119424\">Realme Community</a></strong></p>\n<p class=\"clear:both;\">\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/realme-devices-getting-new-smooth-scrolling-feature/\">Realme devices are getting a new &#8220;Smooth Scrolling&#8221; feature</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com\">xda-developers</a>.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/xda-developers/ShsH/~4/tXgRz90ImWY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 13:10:21 +0000","feedId":388,"bgimg":"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/realme_ui_smooth_scrolling.gif","linkMd5":"e725404a9d9e6809b1913e1f8f233cb0","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn32@2020_2/2020/08/24/13-45-06-561_732ec2a2f61668e7.webp","destWidth":400,"destHeight":402,"sourceBytes":1468848,"destBytes":1039166,"author":"Skanda Hazarika","enclosureUrl":"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2019/02/Realme-Logo_2.png","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/realme_ui_smooth_scrolling.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn32@2020_2/2020/08/24/13-45-06-561_732ec2a2f61668e7.webp","https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/realme_ui_smooth_scrolling_option.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn93@2020_4/2020/08/24/13-45-08-646_f2c1ba0e23cbf36c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/xda-developers/ShsH/~4/tXgRz90ImWY":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn95@2020_2/2020/08/24/13-45-08-506_aa042537ebd23f85.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598276700841},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 21:45:00","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 21:45:00","title":"Moto G9 with Snapdragon 662, 5000mAh battery launched in India for ₹11,499","link":"https://www.xda-developers.com/?p=326699","description":"<p class=\"dropcap\">Motorola launched the <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/motorola-moto-g8-official-snapdragon-665/\">Moto G8 back in March 2020 in Brazil</a>, and then went on to rebrand it as the <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/motorola-moto-g-fast-moto-g-pro/\">Moto G Fast for the US market in May 2020</a>.

The ISP on the 662 is newer than on the 665, but the modem has been downgraded. The Snapdragon 662 also supports Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.1, but the phone actually does not incorporate the same. The implementation on the Moto G9 is just so slightly inferior to that on the Moto G8, which is disappointing.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-326717 size-large\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/G9-Reviewers-Guide-FINAL-VERSION_page15_image6-1024x1024.png\" alt=\"Motorola Moto G9\" width=\"900\" height=\"900\" srcset=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/G9-Reviewers-Guide-FINAL-VERSION_page15_image6-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/G9-Reviewers-Guide-FINAL-VERSION_page15_image6-300x300.png 300w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/G9-Reviewers-Guide-FINAL-VERSION_page15_image6-150x150.png 150w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/G9-Reviewers-Guide-FINAL-VERSION_page15_image6-768x768.png 768w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/G9-Reviewers-Guide-FINAL-VERSION_page15_image6.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>The camera setup is another area of sidegrade.

The third shooter remains a 2MP macro camera, while the front camera also remains an 8MP shooter.</p>\n\n<a href='https://www.xda-developers.com/motorola-moto-g9-snapdragon-662-5000mah-battery-launched-india/moto-g9_3/'><img width=\"384\" height=\"832\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/Moto-G9_3.jpeg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/Moto-G9_3.jpeg 384w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/Moto-G9_3-138x300.jpeg 138w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 384px) 100vw, 384px\" /></a>\n<a href='https://www.xda-developers.com/motorola-moto-g9-snapdragon-662-5000mah-battery-launched-india/moto-g9_2/'><img width=\"384\" height=\"832\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/Moto-G9_2.jpeg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/Moto-G9_2.jpeg 384w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/Moto-G9_2-138x300.jpeg 138w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 384px) 100vw, 384px\" /></a>\n<a href='https://www.xda-developers.com/motorola-moto-g9-snapdragon-662-5000mah-battery-launched-india/moto-g9_1/'><img width=\"384\" height=\"832\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/Moto-G9_1.jpeg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/Moto-G9_1.jpeg 384w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/Moto-G9_1-138x300.jpeg 138w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 384px) 100vw, 384px\" /></a>\n\n<p>The real improvements come in battery and charging, as you now get a bigger 5000 mAh battery and 20W fast charging support.

This brazen challenge was bound to have repercussions, and Epic was all prepared for it. Both Apple and Google promptly removed Fortnite from the App Store and Play Store respectively, which Epic then greeted with legal suits against the companies. This saga has now seen two crucial developments, as Apple has now threatened to cut off support for Unreal Engine from its ecosystem unless Epic complies, a move that then prompted Microsoft to endorse Epic&#8217;s motion for an injunction against Apple.</p>\n<p>It is no secret that both Apple and Google run monopolies when it comes to software distribution systems on their respective platforms. Apple&#8217;s walled garden approach to software makes the Apple App Store an absolute monopoly, while Google&#8217;s CTS and GMS requirements for Google Play Store make it a monopoly in practice even though secondary distribution is possible. These monopolies allow the platform owners to attach a substantial 30% cut from every single purchase made through these stores, and at the same time, discourage competition. Epic decided to challenge this situation by circumventing the fees with its own direct payment system. The reaction from the platform owners was expected, frankly speaking, and Epic&#8217;s consequent legal cases were also foreseeable to an extent.</p>\n<p>What wasn&#8217;t entirely foreseeable is Apple threatening to revoke not only Epic&#8217;s developer account that distributes Fortnite, but also extend the action to Epic-affiliated accounts that are responsible for the development and distribution of Epic&#8217;s Unreal Engine.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Apple removed Fortnite from the App Store and has informed Epic that on Friday, August 28 Apple will terminate all our developer accounts and cut Epic off from iOS and Mac development tools. We are asking the court to stop this retaliation. Details here: <a href=\"https://t.co/3br1EHmyd8\">https://t.co/3br1EHmyd8</a></p>\n<p>— Epic Games Newsroom (@EpicNewsroom) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EpicNewsroom/status/1295430127455596544?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 17, 2020</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>On August 18, Epic shared that Apple has put forth a deadline of August 28 to &#8220;<em>cure breaches to the agreement</em>&#8221; before it goes ahead and terminates all of Epic&#8217;s developer accounts and removes access to iOS and Mac development tools. Apple will terminate Epic&#8217;s inclusion in the Apple Developer Program, which would restrict the ability to distribute apps on iOS or use Apple developer tools. Epic also will not be able to notarize Mac apps either, which would make them impossible to run on newer versions of macOS even if they are distributed outside the App Store. These actions would escalate the Epic-Apple battle to beyond Fortnite and bring in the Unreal Engine as collateral damage.</p>\n<p>Unreal Engine is a popular free-to-start game engine that many developers around the world use to make games for different platforms, amongst other uses. Even games within Apple&#8217;s own Apple Arcade subscription service rely on Unreal Engine. If Apple reacts against Unreal Engine, these developers would struggle to build new iOS games or create updates. The damage would extend beyond Apple&#8217;s ecosystem, as part of Unreal Engine&#8217;s popularity comes from its support for multiple platforms, which would no longer remain as lucrative and would turn customers towards other competing solutions.</p>\n<p>Epic contends that Apple is attacking the company&#8217;s entire business in unrelated areas even though they are governed by separate agreements and are operated by separate legal entities.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Apple argues that its actions with respect to the Unreal Engine and its revocation of access to all developer tools and developer accounts are authorized by contract. They are not. That argument fails to acknowledge the multiple contracts between Apple and Epic affiliates and programmers. Apple has alleged a breach of only one such agreement, and that agreement does not govern Epic’s access to developer tools for the Unreal Engine, the distribution of apps that are used for development purposes by Unreal Engine licensees or various other Epic Developer Program accounts. Even if those contracts did not violate the antitrust laws, an alleged breach of the specific Developer Program License Agreement governing Fortnite would not justify Apple’s actions with respect to other Developer Program accounts (including the account related to the Unreal Engine) or to the revocation of developer tools, all of which are governed by separate agreements. Instead, the breadth of Apple’s retaliation is itself an unlawful effort to maintain its monopoly and chill any action by others who might dare oppose Apple. </em></p>\n<p>Epic mentions that Apple has alleged a breach of only the agreement under which Fortnite was added to the Apple App Store. That agreement apparently does not govern access to the developer tools used to create the Unreal Engine, nor does it govern the accounts used to distribute many of Epic&#8217;s other apps, including those related to the Unreal Engine.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>The account that submitted Fortnite and certain other apps to the App Store has a “Team ID” number ending in ‘84, and is governed by a PLA (Developer Program License Agreement) between Apple and Epic Games, Inc., a Maryland corporation. The account that submitted certain apps related to Unreal Engine development has a “Team ID” number ending in ‘3Y, and is governed by a PLA between Apple and Epic Games International S.à r.l., a Swiss entity. The remaining accounts are held by other entities and were used by Epic’s affiliates to submit other apps to the App Store, such as the Houseparty app.</em></p>\n<p>Further:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Even if the contractual provisions purportedly breached by Fortnite were lawful, Apple’s revocation of all  accounts affiliated with Epic and all access to developer tools (including for the Unreal Engine, which is not an App Store app), reaches far beyond the Team ID ‘84 account and the Epic Games, Inc. PLA.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>First, the August 14 notice states that Epic “will lose access to . . . . [a]ll Apple software, SDKs, APIs, and developer tools” and “[p]re-release versions of iOS, iPaD </em><em>OS, macOS, tvOS [and] watchOS”. Revoking access to all of these materials would extend beyond the rights covered by the PLA and sweep in materials to which Epic (and all other developers and programmers) have access under the SDKs Agreement, which Apple has not claimed Epic breached. The PLA applies only to those “additional rights” not covered by the SDKs Agreement and “is not intended to prevent” the exercise of rights provided in the SDKs Agreement.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Second, even if Epic Games, Inc. breached its PLA in connection with Fortnite, that would not establish a breach by Epic Games International S.à r.l. of its separate PLA. Nor would it establish that any of the four other Epic entities identified in Exhibit T to the Byars Declaration breached any of their PLAs, or that Epic Games, Inc. breached its Developer Enterprise Program License Agreement. Apple does not contend that any other Epic app or the Unreal Engine violated any of Apple’s policies. Indeed, the Unreal Engine is far removed from the payment processing issue of which Apple complains; it is not a consumer-facing product and is not distributed through the App Store (though a few optional tools are distributed through the App Store for use by third-party developers). Instead, the Unreal Engine is a tool licensed for use by other software developers and is downloaded directly from its own website. </em></p>\n<p>Dragging in Unreal Engine in the Epic-Apple faceoff has raised the hairs of many developers who rely on the game engine for their own works. Retaliatory action against Unreal Engine would threaten an entire ecosystem of game developers, according to Epic.

But while POCO is yet to announce the POCO C3 officially, we&#8217;ve now spotted another upcoming POCO device, which might be the successor to the mid-range <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/tag/pocox2/\">POCO X2</a> from earlier this year.

As per the listing, the upcoming POCO device will go by the model number M2007J20CG, and it will feature a new back panel design that doesn&#8217;t resemble any existing Xiaomi smartphone. The image attached in the certification listing (see above) showcases a device with a rectangular camera module with rounded edges, large POCO branding in the center, and what looks to be some form of a textured finish.

The service makes use of actual Samsung smartphones connected to the cloud that developers can control remotely, which gives them an easy way to test the performance of their apps and fine-tune them before release. To ensure that developers get to test their apps on the latest Samsung hardware, the company routinely adds its new devices to the RTL service. Earlier this year in March, the company <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/developers-test-apps-galaxy-s20-galaxy-z-flip-samsung-remote-test-lab/\">added its flagship Galaxy S20 series and the Galaxy Z Flip</a> to the service.

If you&#8217;re an app developer, you can now test your app on the Galaxy Note 20 series without needing to shell out over a thousand dollars on the new Note 20 lineup. To do so, all you need is a reliable internet connection, a free <a href=\"https://developer.samsung.com/\">Samsung Developers account</a>, and Java Runtime Environment 7 or latest with Java Web Start installed.</p>\n<p>With Samsung&#8217;s Remote Test Lab service, you can remotely install APK files on Samsung devices, make screen captures and recordings, and test automation scripts. You can also choose which language you want to test the device in, and the service also lets you share your screen with your partner so that you can test your apps together. However, there are some limitations to the service. The RTL service doesn&#8217;t support audio, additional peripherals, multi-touch, and camera. The service also limits the time you can spend testing your app, and it offers developers 20 credits each, which are good for a maximum of 5 hours of testing per day.</p>\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve finished testing your new app, consider posting it to our forums for feedback from users.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><a href=\"https://forum.xda-developers.com/galaxy-note-20\">Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Forums</a> || </strong><a href=\"https://forum.xda-developers.com/galaxy-note-20-ultra\"><strong>Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra Forums</strong></a></p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source: <a href=\"https://developer.samsung.com/SDP/news/en-us/2020/08/21/galaxy-note20-and-note20-ultra-now-available-in-remote-test-lab\">Samsung Developers</a></strong></p>\n<p class=\"clear:both;\">\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/developers-test-apps-samsung-galaxy-note-20-remote-test-lab/\">Developers can now test their apps on a real Samsung Galaxy Note 20 with Remote Test Lab</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com\">xda-developers</a>.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/xda-developers/ShsH/~4/xqdN_j77zxQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 12:23:14 +0000","feedId":388,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"60268e0e69a585b7f9af1d7d378afae7","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Pranob Mehrotra","enclosureUrl":"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/Galaxy-Note20_2Top.jpg","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/xda-developers/ShsH/~4/xqdN_j77zxQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn60@2020_5/2020/08/24/13-45-08-496_f50a35df2976f37b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598276700841},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 21:45:00","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 21:45:00","title":"Make the Most out of Your Limited Ports with this AUKEY Elite Connection Bundle","link":"https://www.xda-developers.com/?p=323061","description":"<p>If you are looking for a complete-solution bundle for your laptop ports, AUKEY has a really great bundle for you.

The company even hosts events like the <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/oneplus-launches-ideas-program-community-feedback-oxygenos/\">IDEAS program</a> to directly engage with its users and have them suggest <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/5-new-oxygenos-features-oneplus-working-on/\">new features for OxygenOS</a>. Furthermore, OnePlus also posts monthly OxygenOS FAQs on its community forums where it answers some of the most frequently asked questions regarding OxygenOS and, at times, talks about some of the upcoming features. In this month&#8217;s Monthly FAQ post, the company has revealed that it will be adding floating windows support to the <a href=\"https://support.oneplus.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/153/~/gaming-mode-introduction\">Gaming Mode on OxygenOS</a>.</p>\n<p>Answering a question about floating window support in Gaming Mode, the company wrote, <em>&#8220;This function will be available on <a href=\"https://goo.gl/oSh4G9\">OnePlus 6</a> and later models. The floating window will be accessed through the gaming tools box. In gaming tools box, you can not only get <a href=\"https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/whatsapp\">WhatsApp</a> &#38; Instagram floating windows, but also switch on mis-touch prevention, screen recorder, notification and Fnatic Mode.&#8221; </em>The company further added that OnePlus 7/7 Pro/7T/7T Pro users will be able to try the new floating window feature in the next OxygenOS beta update.</p>\n<p>Along with information about the upcoming floating windows support in Gaming Mode, OnePlus&#8217; latest FAQ post addresses an issue with the Ambient display feature on the OnePlus 8//8 Pro, an issue with extended screenshots on the OnePlus 7/7 Pro/7T/7T Pro, and a bug fix for the stock File Manager app on the OnePlus 7/7T. The company also reveals that it has narrowed the activation area for the &#8220;swipe inward from the edge to go back&#8221; gesture to prevent accidental touches.
