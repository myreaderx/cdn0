But Lorne Michaels brought her back to make good on their original plans. Unfortunately, this meant she was forced to host an episode where political satire is taking up the space of three sketches, giving her far fewer opportunities to shine throughout the night. Even the sketches that managed to include her didn&#8217;t make use of her comedic potential, which only added to the frustration that this subpar episode brought to the table.</p>\n<p>Anyway, let&#8217;s look at the best and worst sketches from the Issa Rae hosted <em>Saturday Night Live</em>.<span id=\"more-641760\"></span></p>\n<h2>The Best</h2>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OP0H0j4pCOg?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>5-Hour Empathy</strong> &#8211; This is brilliant satire. In one of<em> SNL</em>&#8216;s traditional commercial parodies, this sketch tackles the struggle that white people have with confronting their own lack of understanding years of systemic oppression and ever-present racism. This is one of those great sketches that confronts a significant social issue with great comedy. Kenan Thompson&#8217;s presence as the commercial&#8217;s narrator who keeps the subjects from getting off easy is the icing on an already fantastic cake.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0XOUJ4ZTcvI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>eBay</strong> &#8211; With a show like <em>SNL</em>, whose reputation comes from being live, it can be a little frustrating when the best sketches are the pre-recorded sketches. But great comedy is great comedy, and in this sketch, everyone who has been cooped up at home during the coronavirus pandemic gets taken to task for spending money on things that they thought would occupy them at home. How many things have we bought that have just sat collecting dust since we bought them?

There&#8217;s no better time for Kazakhstan&#8217;s most famous reporter to come back to America, but this time comedian <strong>Sacha Baron Cohen</strong> hoped to achieve something different than he did the first time around. Though the primary goal of <em><strong>Borat: Subsequent Movie Film: Delivery of Prodigious Bride to American Regime for Make Benefit Once Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan</strong></em> is to make us laugh through shocking and inappropriate behavior and the candid reactions of real people, the character does much more than deliver crass and crude humor.<span id=\"more-641784\"></span></p>\n<p>Speaking with <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/17/style/sacha-baron-cohen-maureen-dowd-interview.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The New York Times</a>, Sacha Baron Cohen points out how the world has changed since Borat came to America in 2005, but not necessarily for the better. Cohen says:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;In 2005, you needed a character like Borat who was misogynist, racist, anti-Semitic to get people to reveal their inner prejudices. Now those inner prejudices are overt. Racists are proud of being racists. My aim here was not to expose racism and anti-Semitism. The aim is to make people laugh, but we reveal the dangerous slide to authoritarianism.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Cohen took on even more risks and put himself in plenty of stressful situations to make this sequel. Not only did <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/sacha-baron-cohen-says-he-wore-bulletproof-vest-feared-for-my-life-after-crashing-far-right-rally-in-washington\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">he wear a bullet proof vest</a> to protect himself as much as possible during an appearance at a conservative rally held in Olympia, Washington, which he wasn&#8217;t confident would keep him safe when the crowd ended up turning on him, but he had to spend five days in lockdown with a group of conspiracy theorists. Cohen recalled:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;The hardest thing I had to do was, I lived in character for five days in this lockdown house. I was waking up, having breakfast, lunch, dinner, going to sleep as Borat when I lived in a house with these two conspiracy theorists. You can’t have a moment out of character.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Cohen even had to spend five hours in a bathroom at the <span class=\"aCOpRe\">Conservative Political Action Conference</span> earlier this year, all so he could ambush Mike Pence&#8217;s appearance at the event in full disguise as Donald Trump. In addition to being one of the biggest gags <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/borat-2-trailer-kazakhstans-famous-reporter-is-back-in-america-and-his-daughter-came-too/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">teased in the trailer</a>, it actually <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/borat-trump-stunt/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">made national news in February</a> before we ever knew about the <em>Borat</em> sequel. What other surprising gags are in store for us?

But since this is a silly game show, those challenges generally involve chaotic limitations (you can only shop in certain aisles) or cruel requirements (your savory dinner must include mustard and a bag of marshmallows). It&#8217;s ridiculous. And addicting.</p>\n<p><strong>Why It’s Essential Viewing</strong>: Look, <em>Guy&#8217;s Grocery Games</em> is not essential viewing. And if you can&#8217;t stomach Guy Fieri, with his low-brow sense of humor and atrocious haircut, this will be a legitimately painful experience. However, there&#8217;s something fundamentally <em>nice </em>about this show, which sidesteps being a cutthroat competition in favor of being an easily digestible showcase of chefs concocting creative and delicious dishes from ingredients available in a standard supermarket. As Pixar&#8217;s <em>Ratatouille</em> explored: anyone can cook.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-641754\"></span></p>\n<p>Although I can&#8217;t say I&#8217;m an especially big Guy Fieri fan (I generally think he&#8217;s loud but harmless, not the End Of Western Civilization, as some people seem to think), he&#8217;s far better here as a wacky game show host than he is in other Food Network programs. The spotlight is rightfully on the chefs he invites onto his show and the truly bizarre, often randomized challenges they have to overcome to win the episode and pocket some cash. I&#8217;m especially fond of the challenges where they have to create lavish meals on a strict budget, which showcase how creativity and ingenuity can supplant money, a democratization of fine dining that I find downright inspiring.</p>\n<p>While others will undeniably be turned off by the show&#8217;s middlebrow tone, I found myself won over by its charms, which are constructed to appeal to Middle America more than people who write for pop culture websites and are supposed to be spending this pandemic watching good things instead of tacky and incredibly entertaining Food Network game shows. And yet, the show&#8217;s casual celebration of people of all backgrounds quietly shines through. This is a show that showcases female chefs, people of color, immigrants, and LGBTQ folks, all of whom compete on equal footing with everyone else. The show never pats itself on the back – it just lets this diversity exist alongside everyone and everything else. For a series that feels so clearly aimed and mainstream tastes, it feels like a low-key statement of purpose. Tacky Food Network game shows belong to <em>everyone</em>, damn it.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d be lying if I said <em>Guy&#8217;s Grocery Games</em> is good TV. It&#8217;s junk food, even if its goal is to celebrate great food. Still, I find myself drawn to it, to its blanket positivity, to its fast pace, to its inherent bingeability. When I wrap up a day of work, I find myself clicking play on this instead of something remotely challenging or thoughtful. I don&#8217;t know what this says about me.
