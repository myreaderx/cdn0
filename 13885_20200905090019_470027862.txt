Based on DNA chain replacement and toehold exchange reaction, we constructed a series of DNA molecular logic devices (4 ChemComm in total). The first work reported DNA three-digit keypad lock, and then we successively constructed 4 to 2 encoders, computational redundant modules and three-bit molecular registers. In the work of the 4 to 2 encoder, for the first time we combined the logic judgment function of DNA circuit with the detection of single base mutation, so that the sensor based on hybridization analysis can not only recognize the presence of single base mutation, but also realize the information feedback of the mutation site region.</p> \n<p><strong>What do you hope your lab can achieve in the coming year?</strong><br /> In the coming year, we hope to make breakthroughs in specific enrichment and intelligent sensing of low abundance SINGLE base mutations in DNA.</p> \n<p><strong>Describe your journey to becoming independent researcher.</strong><br /> I obtained my Bachelor’s degree in Chemistry (2008) and Doctoral degree in Analytical Chemistry (2014) from Wuhan University. My doctoral thesis was on nucleic acid colorimetric sensing based on DNA gold nanoparticles and surface-enhanced Raman analysis method. During this process, I developed a strong interest in DNA circuits. Using molecules to build computing hardware can well combine my major with my hobby in computer science. Therefore, after I got recruited by Shenzhen University as an independent researcher, I focused more on the fields related to DNA nanotechnology, and by attending professional academic conferences and learning from excellent reports of domestic and foreign researchers, my understanding of this frontier field has sufficiently deepened. My first review invitation as an independent researcher also came from <em>ChemComm</em>. Being a reviewer has greatly helped me to stick to the current academic frontier and offered me inspiration in my research.</p> \n<p><strong>What is the best piece of advice you have ever been given?</strong><br /> As my father always teaches me that “details determine success or failure”, I am strict with myself in every thing I do in my work and life, paying attention to every detail and always thinking twice, which has indeed brought me many successes, big and small.</p> \n<p><strong>Why did you choose to publish your first article in <em>ChemComm</em>?</strong><br /> In fact, my first academic paper was published in <em>ChemComm</em>. <em>ChemComm</em> is very friendly to young researchers and encourages all kinds of novel ideas to be published, which impressed me a lot. In 2016, together with my sophomore students, I was very glad to publish my first paper (and the third one in my academic career) in <em>ChemComm</em> as an independent researcher. We modified the hybridization chain reaction to construct a molecule-level DNA three-digit keypad lock, and were honored to be selected as the outside front cover paper. This bond between <em>ChemComm</em> and my academic career has been continuously strengthened and I sincerely wish <em>ChemComm</em> a prosperous future!</p> \n<table style=\"width: 100%;border-collapse: collapse\" border=\"0\"> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td style=\"width: 50%\"><em>Biography: Yizhen Liu is an Associate Professor of College of Chemistry and Enviromental Engineering at Shenzhen University.

Examples include gases such as ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) or carbon monoxide (CO) that can be lethal in just parts-per-million concentrations. Typically, removal of these gases is achieved using porous materials with high surface areas such as zeolites, and more recently covalent- or metal-organic frameworks (COFs or MOFs), which soak up the gases by adsorption to sites within the pores of the structure. Ideally such structures would also be recyclable, whereby the gas can be captured and then safely released without damage to the molecular framework of the material. A collaborative effort by researchers across the world has now demonstrated a recyclable strategy for ammonia adsorption by a MOF, using frustrated Lewis pair chemistry to achieve at least 5 cycles of gas capture and release.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_10217\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://blogs.rsc.org/cc/files/2020/09/ChemComm-Fig-1.gif\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-10217\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-10217\" src=\"https://blogs.rsc.org/cc/files/2020/09/ChemComm-Fig-1-300x129.gif\" alt=\"SION105-Eu MOF structure\" width=\"300\" height=\"129\" srcset=\"https://blogs.rsc.org/cc/files/2020/09/ChemComm-Fig-1-300x129.gif 300w, https://blogs.rsc.org/cc/files/2020/09/ChemComm-Fig-1-768x330.gif 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-10217\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Figure 1. Left: the structure of <strong>SION105-Eu</strong>, showing its porous nature; right: the chemical structure of the anionic tctb linker ligand (tctb3-)</p></div>\n<p>The researchers selected <strong>SION105-Eu</strong> as a highly stable MOF, which uses the triply anionic tctb linker that contains a sterically hindered Lewis acidic boron centre (Figure 1). Normally, ammonia (a Lewis base) will interact with a Lewis acidic boron centre to form a Lewis acid-base adduct. However, the steric demands around the Lewis-acidic boron in the tctb linker ligand prevent the formation of a true adduct with ammonia, instead forming a “frustrated Lewis pair” where the ammonia-boron interaction is considered reversible. This notion therefore allows for ammonia capture by adsorption in the MOF through interaction with the boron centre of the ligand, followed by subsequent ammonia release, since a permanent ammonia-boron interaction is prevented by the steric demands of the linker. Additionally, prevention of permanent adsorption of ammonia within the pores of the MOF prevents any possible collapse of the structure/decomposition, which further enhances the recyclability of the material.</p>\n<p>The researchers measured the adsorption of ammonia by <strong>SION105-Eu</strong> by suspending the MOF in an aqueous solution of NH<sub>3</sub> at ambient pressures (i.e. with a loose cap on the vial) or high pressures (with a closed vial cap). They observed up to 10 wt% adsorption in the ambient pressure system, and up to 36 wt% adsorption in the closed system (Figure 2, top). The researchers noted retention of the MOF crystallinity upon ammonia adsorption by powder X-ray diffraction measurements (PXRD), where the same pattern was observed before and after (Figure 2, bottom). The PXRD patterns in Figure 2 (bottom) also confirmed the weak, “frustrated Lewis pair” type interactions between the MOF and NH<sub>3</sub>, by the appearance of only two new peaks as shown in the squared regions of Figure 2 (bottom).</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_10218\" style=\"width: 202px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://blogs.rsc.org/cc/files/2020/09/ChemComm-Fig-2.gif\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-10218\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-10218\" src=\"https://blogs.rsc.org/cc/files/2020/09/ChemComm-Fig-2-192x300.gif\" alt=\"NH3 adsorption by SION105-Eu MOF\" width=\"192\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://blogs.rsc.org/cc/files/2020/09/ChemComm-Fig-2-192x300.gif 192w, https://blogs.rsc.org/cc/files/2020/09/ChemComm-Fig-2-768x1201.gif 768w, https://blogs.rsc.org/cc/files/2020/09/ChemComm-Fig-2-655x1024.gif 655w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 192px) 100vw, 192px\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-10218\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Figure 2.

The researchers demonstrated this process could be achieved 5 times without change to the ammonia adsorption capacity or structure of the MOF. Overall, this study shows a new frustrated Lewis pair strategy for gas capture and release to render a MOF material recyclable, which has the potential to be applied beyond ammonia removal to other toxic gases.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><u>To find out more, please read:</u></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://xlink.rsc.org/?doi=10.1039/D0CC00741B\"><strong>A recyclable metal–organic framework for ammonia vapour adsorption</strong></a></p>\n<p>Tu N.
