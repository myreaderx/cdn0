But unlike, say, a firearm or drug manufacturer, there is no designated authority that says what these platforms can and can&#8217;t do. So who regulates them? You might say everyone and no one.</p>\n<p>Now, it must be made clear at the outset that these companies are by no means &#8220;unregulated,&#8221; in that no legal business in this country is unregulated. For instance <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/facebook\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"facebook\">Facebook, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> certainly a social media company, received a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/24/facebook-settles-with-ftc-5-billion-and-new-privacy-guarantees/\">record $5 billion fine</a> last year for failure to comply with rules set by the FTC. But not because the company violated its <em>social media regulations</em> — there aren&#8217;t any.</p>\n<p>Facebook and others are bound by the same rules that most companies must follow, such as generally agreed-upon definitions of fair business practices, truth in advertising, and so on. But industries like medicine, energy, alcohol and automotive have additional rules, indeed entire agencies, specific to them; not so with social media companies.</p>\n<p>I say &#8220;social media&#8221; rather than &#8220;tech&#8221; because the latter is much too broad a concept to have a single regulator. Although Google and Amazon (and Airbnb, and Uber, and so on) need new regulation as well, they may require a different specialist, like an algorithmic accountability office or online retail antitrust commission. (Inasmuch as tech companies act within regulated industries, such as Google in broadband, they are already regulated as such.)</p>\n<p>Social media can roughly be defined as platforms where people sign up to communicate and share messages and media, and that&#8217;s quite broad enough already without adding in things like ad marketplaces, competition quashing and other serious issues.</p>\n<p>Who, then, regulates these social media companies? For the purposes of the U.S., there are four main directions from which meaningful limitations or policing may emerge, but each one has serious limitations, and none was actually created for the task.</p>\n<h2>1.

They have indeed called for regulation of social media and big tech — but are for the most part unwilling and unable to do so themselves.</p>\n<p>The Commission&#8217;s mandate is explicitly the cultivation of a robust and equitable communications infrastructure, which these days primarily means fixed and mobile broadband (though increasingly satellite services as well). The applications and businesses that <em>use</em> that broadband, though they may be affected by the FCC&#8217;s decisions, are generally speaking none of the agency&#8217;s business, and it has <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/17/fcc-commissioner-disparages-trumps-social-media-order-the-decision-is-ours-alone/\">repeatedly said so</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"651xFMmbay\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/17/fcc-commissioner-disparages-trumps-social-media-order-the-decision-is-ours-alone/\">FCC Commissioner disparages Trump&#8217;s social media order: &#8216;The decision is ours alone&#8217;</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;FCC Commissioner disparages Trump&#8217;s social media order: &#8216;The decision is ours alone&#8217;&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/17/fcc-commissioner-disparages-trumps-social-media-order-the-decision-is-ours-alone/embed/#?secret=651xFMmbay\" data-secret=\"651xFMmbay\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>The only potentially relevant exception is the much-discussed Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (an amendment to the sprawling Communications Act), which waives liability for companies when illegal content is posted to their platforms, as long as those companies make a &#8220;good faith&#8221; effort to remove it in accordance with the law.</p>\n<p>But this part of the law doesn&#8217;t actually grant the FCC authority over those companies or define good faith, and there&#8217;s an enormous risk of stepping into unconstitutional territory, because a government agency telling a company what content it must keep up or take down runs full speed into the First Amendment.

As watchdog over business practices at large, it has a similar responsibility toward <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/twitter\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"twitter\">Twitter <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> as it does toward Nabisco. It doesn&#8217;t have rules about what a social media company can or can&#8217;t do any more than it has rules about how many flavors of Cheez-It there should be. (There are industry-specific &#8220;guidelines&#8221; but these are more advisory about how general rules have been interpreted.)</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the FTC is very much the force that comes into play should Facebook misrepresent how it shares user data, or Nabisco overstates the amount of real cheese in its crackers. The agency&#8217;s most relevant responsibility to the social media world is that of enforcing the truthfulness of material claims.</p>\n<p>You can thank the FTC for the now-familiar, carefully worded statements that avoid any real claims or responsibilities: &#8220;We take security very seriously&#8221; and &#8220;we think we have the best method&#8221; and that sort of thing — so pretty much everything that Mark Zuckerberg says. Companies and executives are trained to do this to avoid tangling with the FTC: &#8220;Taking security seriously&#8221; isn&#8217;t enforceable, but saying &#8220;user data is never shared&#8221; certainly is.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"B8vuEj4bR8\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/24/facebook-settles-with-ftc-5-billion-and-new-privacy-guarantees/\">Facebook settles with FTC: $5 billion and new privacy guarantees</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Facebook settles with FTC: $5 billion and new privacy guarantees&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/24/facebook-settles-with-ftc-5-billion-and-new-privacy-guarantees/embed/#?secret=B8vuEj4bR8\" data-secret=\"B8vuEj4bR8\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>In some cases this can still have an effect, as in the $5 billion fine recently dropped into Facebook&#8217;s lap (though for many reasons that was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/24/9-reasons-the-facebook-ftc-settlement-is-a-joke/\">actually not very consequential</a>). It&#8217;s important to understand that the fine was for breaking binding promises the company had made — not for violating some kind of social-media-specific regulations, because again, there really aren&#8217;t any.</p>\n<p>The last point worth noting is that the FTC is a <em>reactive</em> agency. Although it certainly has guidelines on the limits of legal behavior, it doesn&#8217;t have rules that when violated result in a statutory fine or charges. Instead, complaints filter up through its many reporting systems and it builds a case against a company, often with the help of the Justice Department. That makes it slow to respond compared with the lightning-fast tech industry, and the companies or victims involved may have moved beyond the point of crisis while a complaint is being formalized there. Equifax&#8217;s historic breach and minimal consequences are an instructive case:</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"a02hRBFQW4\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/22/equifax-fine-ftc/\">FTC slaps Equifax with a fine of up to $700M for 2017 data breach</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;FTC slaps Equifax with a fine of up to $700M for 2017 data breach&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/22/equifax-fine-ftc/embed/#?secret=a02hRBFQW4\" data-secret=\"a02hRBFQW4\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>So: While the FCC and FTC do provide important guardrails for the social media industry, it would not be accurate to say they are its regulators.</p>\n<h2>2. State legislators</h2>\n<p>States are increasingly battlegrounds for the frontiers of tech, including social media companies. This is likely due to frustration with partisan gridlock in Congress that has left serious problems unaddressed for years or decades. Two good examples of states that lost their patience are <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/01/the-california-consumer-privacy-act-officially-takes-effect-today/\">California&#8217;s new privacy rules</a> and Illinois&#8217;s Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA).</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"utytR9VUsD\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/12/californias-privacy-act-what-you-need-to-know-now/\">California&#8217;s Privacy Act: What you need to know now</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;California&#8217;s Privacy Act: What you need to know now&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/12/californias-privacy-act-what-you-need-to-know-now/embed/#?secret=utytR9VUsD\" data-secret=\"utytR9VUsD\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) was arguably born out the ashes of other attempts at a national level to make companies more transparent about their data collection policies, like the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/29/everything-you-need-to-know-about-congress-decision-to-expose-your-data-to-internet-providers/\">ill-fated Broadband Privacy Act</a>.</p>\n<p>California officials decided that if the feds weren&#8217;t going to step up, there was no reason the state shouldn&#8217;t at least look after its own. By convention, state laws that offer consumer protections are generally given priority over weaker federal laws — this is so a state isn&#8217;t prohibited from taking measures for their citizens&#8217; safety while the slower machinery of Congress grinds along.</p>\n<p>The resulting law, very briefly stated, creates formal requirements for disclosures of data collection, methods for opting out of them, and also grants authority for enforcing those laws. The rules may seem like common sense when <em>you</em> read them, but they&#8217;re pretty far out there compared to the relative freedom tech and social media companies enjoyed previously. Unsurprisingly, they have vocally opposed the CCPA.</p>\n<p>BIPA has a somewhat similar origin, in that a particularly far-sighted state legislature created a set of rules in 2008 limiting companies&#8217; collection and use of biometric data like fingerprints and facial recognition. It has proven to be a huge thorn in the side of Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon, Google and others that have taken for granted the ability to analyze a user&#8217;s biological metrics and use them for pretty much whatever they want.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"0IYXN13JAa\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/facial-recognition-lawsuit-vance-janecyk-bipa/\">Lawsuits allege Microsoft, Amazon and Google violated Illinois facial recognition privacy law</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Lawsuits allege Microsoft, Amazon and Google violated Illinois facial recognition privacy law&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/facial-recognition-lawsuit-vance-janecyk-bipa/embed/#?secret=0IYXN13JAa\" data-secret=\"0IYXN13JAa\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/facial-recognition-lawsuit-vance-janecyk-bipa/\">Many lawsuits have been filed</a> alleging violations of BIPA, and while few have produced <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/29/facebook-will-pay-550-million-to-settle-class-action-lawsuit-over-privacy-violations/\">notable punishments like this one</a>, they have been invaluable in forcing the companies to admit on the record exactly what they&#8217;re doing, and how. Sometimes it&#8217;s quite surprising! The optics are terrible, and tech companies have lobbied (fortunately, with little success) to have the law replaced or weakened.</p>\n<p>What&#8217;s crucially important about both of these laws is that they force companies to, in essence, choose between universally meeting a new, higher standard for something like privacy, or establishing a tiered system whereby some users get more privacy than others. The thing about the latter choice is that once people learn that users in Illinois and California are getting &#8220;special treatment,&#8221; they start asking why Mainers or Puerto Ricans aren&#8217;t getting it as well.</p>\n<p>In this way state laws exert outsize influence, forcing companies to make changes nationally or globally because of decisions that technically only apply to a small subset of their users. You may think of these states as being activists (especially if their attorneys general are proactive), or simply ahead of the curve, but either way they are making their mark.</p>\n<p>This is not ideal, however, because taken to the extreme, it produces a patchwork of state laws created by local authorities that may conflict with one another or embody different priorities. That, at least, is the doomsday scenario predicted almost universally by companies in a position to lose out.</p>\n<p>State laws act as a test bed for new policies, but tend to only emerge when movement at the federal level is too slow. Although they may hit the bullseye now and again, like with BIPA, it would be unwise to rely on a single state or any combination among them to miraculously produce, like so many simian legislators banging on typewriters, a comprehensive regulatory structure for social media. Unfortunately, that leads us to Congress.</p>\n<h2>3.

Even in the best of times few would trust these people to establish reasonable, clear rules that reflect reality. Congress simply is not the right tool for the job, because of its<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/07/congress-flaunts-its-ignorance-in-house-hearing-on-net-neutrality/\"> stubborn and willful ignorance on almost all issues of technology</a> and social media, its countless conflicts of interest and its painful sluggishness — sorry, deliberation — in actually writing and passing any bills, let alone good ones.</p>\n<p>Companies oppose state laws like the CCPA while calling for national rules because they know that it will take forever and there&#8217;s more opportunity to get their finger in the pie before it&#8217;s baked. National rules, in addition to coming far too late, are much more likely also to be watered down and riddled with loopholes by industry lobbyists. (This is indicative of the influence these companies wield over their own regulation, but it&#8217;s hardly official.)</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"7twn8Ct3v5\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/07/congress-flaunts-its-ignorance-in-house-hearing-on-net-neutrality/\">Congress flaunts its ignorance in House hearing on net neutrality</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Congress flaunts its ignorance in House hearing on net neutrality&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/07/congress-flaunts-its-ignorance-in-house-hearing-on-net-neutrality/embed/#?secret=7twn8Ct3v5\" data-secret=\"7twn8Ct3v5\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>But Congress isn&#8217;t a total loss. In moments of clarity it has established expert agencies like those in the first item, which have Congressional oversight but are otherwise independent, empowered to make rules, and kept technically — if somewhat limply — nonpartisan.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the question of social media regulation is too recent for Congress to have empowered a specialist agency to address it. Social media companies don&#8217;t fit neatly into any of the categories that existing specialists regulate, something that is plainly evident by the present attempt to stretch Section 230 beyond the breaking point just to put someone on the beat.</p>\n<p>Laws at the federal level are not to be relied on for regulation of this fast-moving industry, as the current state of things shows more than adequately.

But in a sort of inside-out version of state laws punching above their weight, laws that affect a huge part of the world <em>except</em> the U.S. can still have a major effect on how companies operate here.</p>\n<p>The most obvious example is the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/tag/gdpr/\">General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR</a>, a set of rules, or rather augmentation of existing rules dating to 1995, that has begun to change the way some social media companies do business.</p>\n<p>But this is only the latest step in a fantastically complex, decades-long process that must harmonize the national laws and needs of the EU member states in order to provide the clout it needs to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/16/iab-europes-ad-tracking-consent-framework-found-to-fail-gdpr-standard/\">compel adherence to the international rules</a>.

Europe&#8217;s role in that question of, if you will, speaking slowly and carrying a big stick promises to produce results on a grand scale, but for the purposes of this article it cannot really be considered an effective policing body.</p>\n<p>(TechCrunch&#8217;s EU regulatory maven <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/author/natasha-lomas/\">Natasha Lomas</a> contributed to this section.)</p>\n<h2>5. No one? Really?</h2>\n<p>As you can see, the regulatory ecosystem in which social media swims is more or less free of predators. The most dangerous are the small, agile ones — state legislatures — that can take a bite before the platforms have had a chance to brace for it. The other regulators are either too slow, too compromised or too involved (or some combination of the three) to pose a real threat. For this reason it may be necessary to introduce a new, but familiar, species: the expert agency.</p>\n<p>As noted above, the FCC is the most familiar example of one of these, though its role is so fragmented that one could be forgiven for forgetting that it was originally created to ensure the integrity of the telephone and telegraph system. Why, then, is it the expert agency for orbital debris? That&#8217;s a story for another time.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2023746\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/capitol-congress-hearing-government-techcrunch-bryce-durbin.jpeg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2023746\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout wp-image-2023746 size-full\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/capitol-congress-hearing-government-techcrunch-bryce-durbin.jpeg\" alt=\"Capitol building\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/capitol-congress-hearing-government-techcrunch-bryce-durbin.jpeg 3200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/capitol-congress-hearing-government-techcrunch-bryce-durbin.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/capitol-congress-hearing-government-techcrunch-bryce-durbin.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/capitol-congress-hearing-government-techcrunch-bryce-durbin.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/capitol-congress-hearing-government-techcrunch-bryce-durbin.jpeg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/capitol-congress-hearing-government-techcrunch-bryce-durbin.jpeg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/capitol-congress-hearing-government-techcrunch-bryce-durbin.jpeg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/capitol-congress-hearing-government-techcrunch-bryce-durbin.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2023746\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image Credits: Bryce Durbin/TechCrunch</p></div></p>\n<p>What is clearly needed is the establishment of an independent expert agency or commission in the U.S., at the federal level, that has statutory authority to create and enforce rules pertaining to the handling of consumer data by social media platforms.</p>\n<p>Like the FCC (and somewhat like the EU&#8217;s DPAs), this should be officially nonpartisan — though like the FCC it will almost certainly vacillate in its allegiance — and should have specific mandates on what it can and can&#8217;t do. For instance, it would be improper and unconstitutional for such an agency to say this or that topic of speech should be disallowed from Facebook or Twitter. But it would be able to say that companies need to have a reasonable and accessible definition of the speech they forbid, and likewise a process for auditing and contesting takedowns. (The details of how such an agency would be formed and shaped is well beyond the scope of this article.)</p>\n<p>Even the likes of the FAA lags behind industry changes, such as the upsurge in drones that necessitated a hasty revisit of existing rules, or the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/faa-streamlines-commercial-launch-rules-to-keep-the-rockets-flying/\">huge increase in commercial space launches</a>. But that&#8217;s a feature, not a bug. These agencies are designed not to act unilaterally based on the wisdom and experience of their leaders, but are required to perform or solicit research, consult with the public and industry alike, and create evidence-based policies involving, or at least addressing, a minimum of sufficiently objective data.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"XTGJzVhOck\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/faa-streamlines-commercial-launch-rules-to-keep-the-rockets-flying/\">FAA streamlines commercial launch rules to keep the rockets flying</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;FAA streamlines commercial launch rules to keep the rockets flying&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/faa-streamlines-commercial-launch-rules-to-keep-the-rockets-flying/embed/#?secret=XTGJzVhOck\" data-secret=\"XTGJzVhOck\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>Sure, that didn&#8217;t really work with net neutrality, but I think you&#8217;ll find that industries have been unwilling to capitalize on this temporary abdication of authority by the FCC because they see that the Commission&#8217;s current makeup is fighting a losing battle against voluminous evidence, public opinion and common sense. They see the writing on the wall and understand that under this system it can no longer be ignored.</p>\n<p>With an analogous authority for social media, the evidence could be made public, the intentions for regulation plain, and the shareholders — that is to say, users — could make their opinions known in a public forum that isn&#8217;t owned and operated by the very companies they aim to rein in.</p>\n<p>Without such an authority these companies and their activities — the scope of which we have only the faintest clue to — will remain in a blissful limbo, picking and choosing by which rules to abide and against which to fulminate and lobby. We must help them decide, and weigh our own priorities against theirs. They have already abused the naïve trust of their users across the globe — perhaps it&#8217;s time we asked them to trust us for once.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=pzy-MXIIM24:jkYyVrOInVk:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=pzy-MXIIM24:jkYyVrOInVk:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=pzy-MXIIM24:jkYyVrOInVk:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=pzy-MXIIM24:jkYyVrOInVk:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=pzy-MXIIM24:jkYyVrOInVk:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=pzy-MXIIM24:jkYyVrOInVk:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=pzy-MXIIM24:jkYyVrOInVk:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=pzy-MXIIM24:jkYyVrOInVk:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/pzy-MXIIM24\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 19 Oct 2020 20:33:42 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/gettyimages-892306966.jpg","linkMd5":"51df6acda2a2b8cd8fdbcaaef561e7c4","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn16@2020_4/2020/10/20/02-04-37-916_e6f604ac61b33e0a.webp","destWidth":4000,"destHeight":2667,"sourceBytes":3479543,"destBytes":1988542,"author":"Devin Coldewey","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/gettyimages-892306966.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn16@2020_4/2020/10/20/02-04-37-916_e6f604ac61b33e0a.webp","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/united-states-capitol-spatter.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn100@2020_3/2020/10/20/02-04-56-671_b1e84f40bd42cc6f.webp","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/eu-gdpr-1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn91@2020_6/2020/10/20/02-04-57-402_f3e2a111598fc950.webp","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/capitol-congress-hearing-government-techcrunch-bryce-durbin.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn58@2020_1/2020/10/20/02-04-56-464_0e5c8438756e4431.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn20@2020_2/2020/10/20/02-04-36-957_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn95@2020_6/2020/10/20/02-05-34-320_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn86@2020_4/2020/10/20/02-04-56-231_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=pzy-MXIIM24:jkYyVrOInVk:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn23@2020_6/2020/10/20/02-04-56-298_4ef5643bad9c72fe.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=pzy-MXIIM24:jkYyVrOInVk:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn68@2020_6/2020/10/20/02-04-57-179_1c6c911ec19e0113.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn27@2020_6/2020/10/20/02-05-09-402_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/pzy-MXIIM24":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn83@2020_1/2020/10/20/02-04-56-223_d88828a7e7c264dd.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603159476458},{"createdTime":"2020-10-20 10:04:36","updatedTime":"2020-10-20 10:04:36","title":"Daily Crunch: Pakistan un-bans TikTok","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2062848","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/tiktok\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"tiktok\">TikTok <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> returns to Pakistan, Apple launches a music-focused streaming station and SpaceX launches more Starlink satellites.

We&#8217;re doing that tomorrow <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/\">right here at The Exchange</a>. Ready? This should be both fun and informative. Let&#8217;s go!</p>\n<h2>A massive third quarter</h2>\n<p>To get a clear look at the U.S. venture capital market, we&#8217;ll start from the top down. So, the biggest numbers first, followed by increasingly narrow slices of data so we can drill down into smaller startups.</p>\n<p>First, the top-line numbers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>How much money was raised by U.S.-based startups in Q3 2020?</strong> $36.5 billion, according to CBInsights, $37.8 billion according to PitchBook. Those numbers are effectively the same for purposes. CBInsights calls the number a seven-quarter high, up 22% from the Q3 2019 number and 30% from the Q2 2020 result. PitchBook agrees that Q3 2020 was strong, but has its count just under Q2 2020&#8217;s own.</li>\n<li><strong>How many deals was that money spread between?</strong> CBInsights counts 1,461 VC deals in Q3 2020 for U.S.-based startups. Per its numbers, that figure is up 1% from Q2 2020 and down 11% from Q3 2019. PitchBook, in contrast, counts 2,990 total deals, inclusive of rounds that it expects to be added as information about the quarter fills in. That tally &#8220;held steady&#8221; compared to Q3 2019, per the company.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What to make of all this information? Simple: Q3 2020 U.S.-based startup venture capital dollar volume was very strong, with deal counts coming in slightly weaker.</p>\n<p>This means that we saw fewer, larger deals in the quarter on average, right?

There are <a href=\"http://www.bbs.gov.bd/site/page/d13ee628-7458-4650-a824-6423d35d3620/Economic-Census-2013\">about 4.5 million</a> such mom-and-pop stores in the country and the vast majority of them have no digital presence.</p>\n<div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div> \n<p><a href=\"https://shopup.com.bd/\">ShopUp</a> is attempting to change that. It has built what it calls a full-stack business-to-business commerce platform. It provides three core services to neighborhood stores: a wholesale marketplace to secure inventory, logistics (including last mile delivery to customers), and working capital, explained Afeef Zaman, co-founder and chief executive of ShopUp​, in an interview with TechCrunch.</p> \n<p>\n <div id=\"attachment_2062928\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n  <img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2062928\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2062928\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ShopUp-retailer-picture-2.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ShopUp-retailer-picture-2.jpeg 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ShopUp-retailer-picture-2.jpeg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ShopUp-retailer-picture-2.jpeg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ShopUp-retailer-picture-2.jpeg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ShopUp-retailer-picture-2.jpeg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ShopUp-retailer-picture-2.jpeg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" />\n  <p id=\"caption-attachment-2062928\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> ShopUp</p>\n </div></p> \n<p>These small shops are facing a number of challenges.&nbsp;They are not getting inventory on time or enough inventory and they are paying more than what they should, said Zaman. And for these businesses, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2062921/file:///Users/refsrc/Downloads/11.10.18-MMLA-Research-Brief%20(1).pdf\">more than 73%</a> (PDF) of all their sales rely on credit instead of cash or digital payments, creating a massive liquidity crunch. So most of these businesses are in dire need of working capital.</p> \n<p>Zaman declined to reveal how many mom-and-pop shops today use ShopUp, but claimed that the platform assumes a clear lead in its category in the country. That lead has widened amid the global pandemic as more physical shops explore digital offerings to stay afloat, he said.</p> \n<p>The number of neighborhood shops transacting weekly on the ShopUp platform grew by 8.5 times between April and August this year, he said. The pandemic also helped ShopUp engage with e-commerce players to deliver items for them.</p> \n<p>“Sequoia India has been a strong supporter of the company since it was part of the first Surge cohort in early 2019 and it’s been exciting to see the company become a trailblazer facilitating digital transformation in Bangladesh,” said ​Klaus Wang, VP, Sequoia Capital, in a statement.</p> \n<p>The startup has no intention to become an e-commerce platform like Amazon that directly engages with consumers, Zaman said. E-commerce is still in its nascent stage in Bangladesh. Amazon has yet to enter the country and increasingly <a href=\"https://restofworld.org/2020/bangladesh-economy-runs-on-facebook/\">Facebook is filling that role</a>.</p> \n<p>ShopUp sees immense opportunity in serving neighborhood stores, he said. The startup plans to deploy the fresh capital to deepen its partnerships with manufacturers and expand its tech infrastructure.</p> \n<p>It opened an office in Bengaluru earlier this year to hire local tech talent in the nation. Indian e-commerce platform Voonik <a href=\"https://entrackr.com/2020/02/unable-to-find-buyers-voonik-turns-to-bangladeshs-shopup/\">merged with ShopUp this year</a> and both of its co-founders have joined the Bangladeshi startup. Zaman said the startup will hire more engineering talent in India.</p> \n<div class=\"feedflare\"> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=4iCgpcR6Gm4:bJOYUchr_XU:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=4iCgpcR6Gm4:bJOYUchr_XU:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=4iCgpcR6Gm4:bJOYUchr_XU:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=4iCgpcR6Gm4:bJOYUchr_XU:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=4iCgpcR6Gm4:bJOYUchr_XU:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=4iCgpcR6Gm4:bJOYUchr_XU:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=4iCgpcR6Gm4:bJOYUchr_XU:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=4iCgpcR6Gm4:bJOYUchr_XU:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n</div>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/4iCgpcR6Gm4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 20 Oct 2020 00:48:11 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ShopUp-retailer-picture-2.jpeg","linkMd5":"54b308add889c214ec2de0baaf194f3b","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn22@2020_4/2020/10/20/02-04-44-050_15765d33e2b83df6.webp","destWidth":1280,"destHeight":960,"sourceBytes":211041,"destBytes":177032,"author":"Manish Singh","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ShopUp-retailer-picture-2.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn22@2020_4/2020/10/20/02-04-44-050_15765d33e2b83df6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn20@2020_2/2020/10/20/02-04-36-957_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn95@2020_6/2020/10/20/02-05-34-320_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn86@2020_4/2020/10/20/02-04-56-231_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=4iCgpcR6Gm4:bJOYUchr_XU:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn43@2020_5/2020/10/20/02-04-57-563_dae643a093e1cea3.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=4iCgpcR6Gm4:bJOYUchr_XU:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn79@2020_6/2020/10/20/02-05-10-459_67c2102558584306.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn27@2020_6/2020/10/20/02-05-09-402_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/4iCgpcR6Gm4":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn35@2020_6/2020/10/20/02-04-57-519_b29186c58bd12e0d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603159476458},{"createdTime":"2020-10-20 10:04:36","updatedTime":"2020-10-20 10:04:36","title":"SAIF Partners rebrands as Elevation Capital, secures $400 million for its new India fund","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2062879","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/saif-partners\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"saif-partners\">SAIF Partners <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> has raised $400 million for a new fund and rebranded the 18-year-old influential venture capital firm as it looks to back more early-stage startups in the world’s second largest internet market.</p>\n<p>The new fund is SAIF Partners’ seventh for early-stage startups in India.

For our new partners, it is a promise to do all we can to achieve great heights together, from day one,” said Adusumalli.</p>\n<p>SAIF Partners has backed more than 100 startups to date. The venture firm makes long-term bets on founders and backs young firms beginning their early years when they are raising their seed, pre-Series A and Series A financing rounds.</p>\n<p>The venture firm invests in startups operating in a wide-range of sectors and plans to continue this strategy and add more areas of interest, said Deepak Gaur, a managing director at <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/elevation-capital-0e9d\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"elevation-capital-0e9d\">Elevation Capital, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>“Enterprise SaaS is one area where we are spending a lot of resources,” he said. “We believe the time has come for this sector and we will see many global companies emerge from India.”</p>\n<p>More than 15 startups in Elevation Capital’s portfolio are projected to become a unicorn in the next few years, according to Tracxn, a firm that tracks startups and investments in India.

Elevation Capital has over three dozen employees, with about two-dozen focused on the investment size.</p>\n<p>Elevation Capital’s new fund comes at a time when many established venture capital firms have also closed their new funds for India in recent months. In July, Sequoia Capital <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/06/sequoia-announces-1-35-billion-venture-and-growth-funds-for-india-and-southeast-asia/\">announced two funds</a> &#8212; totaling $1.35 billion in size &#8212; for India.

Less than a week later, Google updated the Home, after four years, with the rebranded <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/google-unveils-the-99-nest-audio-smart-speaker/\">Nest Audio</a>. And then, last week, Apple unveiled the long-awaited $99 <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/13/apple-reveals-the-99-homepod-mini/\">HomePod Mini</a>, finally delivering an affordable version of its Siri speaker.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Amazon, for its part, has easily offered the most regular refreshes of the three. Both the Echo and Echo Dot are currently on their fourth iterations. The Echo Dot with Clock is only on its second (having just been introduced), but for all intents and purposes, the device is basically an Echo Dot — but, you know, with a clock.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"ri1AcQltKB\"><p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/amazon-redesigns-echo-dot-as-a-sphere-adds-animal-designs-and-reading-feature-for-kids-edition/\">Amazon redesigns Echo Dot as a sphere, adds animal designs and reading feature for Kids Edition</a></p></blockquote><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Amazon redesigns Echo Dot as a sphere, adds animal designs and reading feature for Kids Edition&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/amazon-redesigns-echo-dot-as-a-sphere-adds-animal-designs-and-reading-feature-for-kids-edition/embed/#?secret=ri1AcQltKB\" data-secret=\"ri1AcQltKB\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p class=\"p1\">The latest update to the line finds the company offering a kind of design uniformity across the smart speakers. The Dot really does look like a diminutive version of the standard Echo. I wasn’t entirely sure how large a difference there would be between the two products, but it’s definitely pronounced. The Echo is the size of a large grapefruit and the Dot is essentially the size of a softball.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The Dot’s size lends it a good deal more flexibility in terms of placement. I could definitely see placing them in nooks and crannies throughout my place to create a kind of makeshift sound system (though the in-box cable is on the short side, so you’ll likely need an extension if you’re not close to an outlet).</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2062449\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2062449\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2062449\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ezgif-4-ccb7c0f37751.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2062449\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The majority of the speaker is covered in fabric, though the hard plastic bottom arcs up on the back of the device, occupying a large portion of the back. This allows for the inclusion of two ports (power and auxiliary audio out), though it also limits the speaker surface area on the device, restricting a full 360 approach unlike the older hockey puck design. As such, the speaker is just front-facing, in spite of the round design.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The new Echo devices, it’s worth noting, are one in a growing number of devices from big companies that are included as part of a push toward climate consciousness. I won’t really address Amazon’s larger overall carbon footprint here, but it’s nice to see some of that trickling down into these products.

The status light ring has been moved to the bottom of the device — that seems to be more of a practical choice than anything.

If it’s around eye-level, great. If it’s below that, it moves the ring out of view, and you may have to rely on seeing how it reflects off the surface it’s sitting on. For my own use, it’s a small step in the wrong direction. The digital clock (the big differentiator between the two Dots) is also a bit low on the ball, leaving a lot of blank surface area up top.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Again, I think Amazon is anticipating people will stick it around eye level, which is certainly the case if you primarily use the clock while lying in bed. The clock itself is plenty bright. And honestly, it’s nice just having a simple digital display sometimes, versus a full-on smart screen. That’s especially the case if you plan to stick it near your bed. That, after all, is supposed to be a kind of refuge from screens. That’s doubly important these days when we’re seemingly never not in front of one.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2062448\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2062448\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2062448\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2020-10-19-123742669.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2020-10-19-123742669.jpg 3551w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2020-10-19-123742669.jpg?resize=150,112 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2020-10-19-123742669.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2020-10-19-123742669.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2020-10-19-123742669.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2020-10-19-123742669.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2020-10-19-123742669.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2020-10-19-123742669.jpg?resize=50,37 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2062448\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">That said, the uses for the face are pretty much limited. You get a “Hello” at launch, the time (naturally), the weather when prompted and the volume level. That last bit can be adjusted with voice or with a pair of physical buttons up top. Those are joined by the Alexa button, which fires up the assistant and the always-important microphone off. That turns red when you tap it, along with a red ring on the bottom of the device to let you known the speaker has stopped listening until it’s reenabled.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The sound quality is basically the same — which is to say, kind of what you’d expect from a $50 to $60 smart speaker. Though the company is quick to note that the move to a front firing speaker helps concentrate the sound a bit. It’s good for all of the voice functionality you need, but I certainly wouldn’t rely on it as my default home speaker — even with a couple of them paired up. As an alarm clock, however, sure, go for it. It certainly beats the speaker on your phone.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2062445\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2062445\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2062445\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2020-10-19-123741537.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2020-10-19-123741537.jpg 3024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2020-10-19-123741537.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2020-10-19-123741537.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2020-10-19-123741537.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2020-10-19-123741537.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2020-10-19-123741537.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2020-10-19-123741537.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2020-10-19-123741537.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2062445\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The $10 price difference between the Dot and Dot with Clock is a bit of a weird one. I’d anticipate in future generations, Amazon will just combine them into one product, priced the same as the standard Dot. For now, however, telling time at a glance is going to cost you a little extra.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The new Echo arrives October 22. The Dot with Clock won’t be available until November 5.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=y0WJZ5AVDPE:AApr2DT7xnM:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=y0WJZ5AVDPE:AApr2DT7xnM:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=y0WJZ5AVDPE:AApr2DT7xnM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=y0WJZ5AVDPE:AApr2DT7xnM:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=y0WJZ5AVDPE:AApr2DT7xnM:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=y0WJZ5AVDPE:AApr2DT7xnM:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=y0WJZ5AVDPE:AApr2DT7xnM:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=y0WJZ5AVDPE:AApr2DT7xnM:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/y0WJZ5AVDPE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 19 Oct 2020 21:07:42 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ezgif-4-ccb7c0f37751.gif","linkMd5":"5e70f993826c57005c8aa9a2ed14c38e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn9@2020_5/2020/10/20/02-04-39-250_23840c1c699ac446.webp","destWidth":600,"destHeight":338,"sourceBytes":7518194,"destBytes":1803412,"author":"Brian Heater","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ezgif-4-ccb7c0f37751.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn9@2020_5/2020/10/20/02-04-39-250_23840c1c699ac446.webp","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2020-10-19-123742059.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn36@2020_4/2020/10/20/02-04-57-160_667edac3b2462f76.webp","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2020-10-19-123742669.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn15@2020_5/2020/10/20/02-05-15-213_4ada77eb36f83c9f.webp","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2020-10-19-123741537.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn47@2020_2/2020/10/20/02-05-05-518_c34879cb05ba7cc3.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn20@2020_2/2020/10/20/02-04-36-957_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn95@2020_6/2020/10/20/02-05-34-320_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn86@2020_4/2020/10/20/02-04-56-231_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=y0WJZ5AVDPE:AApr2DT7xnM:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn4@2020_5/2020/10/20/02-04-57-334_ddd2fb47f4eebbc3.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=y0WJZ5AVDPE:AApr2DT7xnM:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn43@2020_6/2020/10/20/02-05-10-459_ffd4bda7797e3327.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn27@2020_6/2020/10/20/02-05-09-402_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/y0WJZ5AVDPE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn38@2020_4/2020/10/20/02-04-56-209_f5719dfb81b273eb.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603159476458},{"createdTime":"2020-10-20 10:04:36","updatedTime":"2020-10-20 10:04:36","title":"Lockheed picks Relativity’s 3D-printed rocket for experimental NASA mission","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2062483","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/relativity-space\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"relativity-space\">Relativity Space <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> has bagged its first public government contract, and with a major defense contractor at that.

The delicacy of having a dozen cryogenic operations being loaded up and tested until moments before launch necessitates a number of modifications that, in other days, would result in a massive increase in manufacturing complexity.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If you look at the manufacturing tools being used today, they&#8217;re not much different from the last 60 years,&#8221; Ellis explained. &#8220;It&#8217;s fixed tooling, giant machines that look impressive but only make one shape or one object that&#8217;s been designed by hand. And it&#8217;ll take 12-24 months to make it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Not so with Relativity.</p>\n<p>\n\t\t<div class=\"embed breakout\" id=\"vidible_div_0\" data-pid=\"56fe55eee4b0041c4240a171\" data-bcid=\"564f313b67b6231408bc51ee\" data-video=\"5eb487ae7a627b7c72711d22\"></div>\n\t\t<span><script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/themes/techcrunch-2017/features/shortcodes/vidible-callback-js.php?id=0\"></script></span>\n\t\t</p>\n<p>&#8220;With our 3D-printed approach we can print the entire fairing in under 30 days,&#8221; Ellis said. &#8220;It&#8217;s also software defined, so we can just change the file to change the dimensions and shape. For this particular object we have some custom features that we&#8217;re able to do more quickly and adapt. Even though the mission is three years out, there will always be last-minute changes as you get closer to launch, and we can accommodate that. Otherwise you&#8217;d have to lock in the design now.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Ellis was excited about the opportunity to publicly take on a mission with such a major contractor. These enormous companies field billions of government dollars and take part in many launches, so it&#8217;s important to be in their good books, or at least in their rolodexes. A mission like this, complex but comparatively low stakes (compared with a crewed launch or billion-dollar satellite) is a great chance for a company like Relativity to show its capabilities.

If you’ve been keeping an eye on the Raspberry Pi releases, you know that the flagship Raspberry Pi 4 was released <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/23/the-raspberry-pi-foundation-unveils-the-raspberry-pi-4/\">in June 2019</a>. The Compute Module 4 features the same processor, but packed in a compute module for industrial use cases.</p>\n<p>A traditional Raspberry Pi is a single-board computer with a ton of ports sticking out. Compute Modules are somewhat different. Those system-on-module variants are more compact single-board computers without any traditional port.</p>\n<p>It lets you create a prototype using a traditional Raspberry Pi, and then order a bunch of Compute Modules to embed in your commercial products. “Over half of the seven million Raspberry Pi units we sell each year go into industrial and commercial applications, from digital signage to thin clients to process automation,” Eben Upton <a href=\"https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/raspberry-pi-compute-module-4/\">wrote</a> on the Raspberry Pi blog.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>Some things are strictly similar between the Raspberry Pi 4 and the Compute Module 4, such as the 64-bit ARM-based processor with VideoCore VI graphics. This is going to represent a huge upgrade for previous Compute Module customers.</p>\n<p>In particular, you get much better video performance with 4Kp60 hardware decode for H.265 videos, 1080p60 hardware decode for H.264 videos and 1080p30 hardware encode of H.264 videos. You can also take advantage of the dual HDMI interfaces to connect up to two 4K displays at 60 frames per second.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"yhnbmHn4in\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/23/the-raspberry-pi-foundation-unveils-the-raspberry-pi-4/\">The Raspberry Pi Foundation unveils the Raspberry Pi 4</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;The Raspberry Pi Foundation unveils the Raspberry Pi 4&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/23/the-raspberry-pi-foundation-unveils-the-raspberry-pi-4/embed/#?secret=yhnbmHn4in\" data-secret=\"yhnbmHn4in\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>Another big change with the Compute Module 4 is that there are <em>a ton</em> of options. You can choose compute modules with or without wireless technologies (Wi-Fi and Bluetooth), with 1GB, 2GB, 4GB or 8GB of RAM, with 8GB, 16GB or 32GB of eMMC flash storage. There’s also a model without any eMMC flash storage in case you want to use external eMMC or the SD card interface.</p>\n<p>You can mix-and-match those specs to keep your costs down at scale. The result is that there are 32 different versions of the Compute Module 4 ranging from $25 (no wireless, 1GB of RAM, &#8220;Lite&#8221; eMMC) to $90 (wireless, 8GB of RAM, 32GB of eMMC).</p>\n<p>The form factor has changed compared to the previous Compute Module, which means that you’ll need a new Compute Module IO Board to take advantage of all the interfaces and start developing. It costs $35.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2062422\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2062422\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full

announced earlier this month <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/12/walt-disney-announces-reorganization-to-focus-on-streaming/\">that it&#8217;s going all-in on streaming media</a>.</p>\n<p>As part of this new strategy, the company is undergoing a major reorganisation of its media and entertainment business that will focus on developing productions that will debut on its streaming and broadcast services.</p>\n<p>This will include merging the company&#8217;s media businesses, ads and distribution, and Disney+ divisions so that they&#8217;ll now operate under the same business unit.</p>\n<p>As TechCrunch&#8217;s Jonathan Shieber <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/12/walt-disney-announces-reorganization-to-focus-on-streaming/\">reports</a>, Disney’s announcement follows a significant change to its release schedule to address new realities, including a collapsing theatrical release business; production issues; and the runaway success of its Disney+ streaming service — all caused or accelerated by the national failure to effectively address the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>\n<p>So what better time than now to give Disney+ the Extra Crunch user experience teardown treatment. With the help of <a href=\"https://builtformars.co.uk/\">Built for Mars</a> founder and UX expert Peter Ramsey, we highlight some of the things Disney+ gets right and things that should be fixed. They include zero distractions while signing up, &#8220;the power of percentages,&#8221; and the importance of designing for trackpad, mouse and touch outside of native applications.</p>\n<h2>Zero distractions while signing up</h2>\n<p>If the user is trying to complete a very specific task — such as making a payment — don’t distract them. They’re experiencing event-driven behaviour.</p>\n<p>The win: Disney have almost entirely removed any kind of distractions when signing up. This includes the header and footer. They want you to stay on-task.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2062328\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2062328\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2062328\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-19-at-15.12.06.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"364\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-19-at-15.12.06.png 1762w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-19-at-15.12.06.png?resize=150,80 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-19-at-15.12.06.png?resize=300,160 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-19-at-15.12.06.png?resize=768,411 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-19-at-15.12.06.png?resize=680,364 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-19-at-15.12.06.png?resize=1536,821 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-19-at-15.12.06.png?resize=50,27 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2062328\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Disney+</p></div></p>\n<p><strong>Steve O&#8217;Hear: This seems like a very easy win but one we don&#8217;t see as often as perhaps we should.

Sometimes you see sign-up screens that have Google Adwords on it, and I think, &#8220;You’re risking the user getting distracted and leaving for what, half a penny?&#8221; If I had to guess why more companies don’t utilise this technique, it’s probably just because they don’t want to deal with the technical hassle of hiding a bunch of elements.</p>\n<h2>The power of percentages</h2>\n<p>Only use percentages when it makes sense. 80% off sounds like a lot, but 3% doesn’t. Percentages can be a great way of making a discount seem larger than it actually is, but sometimes it can have the reverse effect. This is because people are generally bad at accurately estimating discounts. “What’s 13% off £78?”</p>\n<p>The fail: If you sign up to a year of Disney+, then you&#8217;re offered 16% free. But 16% isn’t easy to calculate in your head — so people guess. And sometimes, their guesses may be less than the actual value of the discount.</p>\n<p>The fix: In this instance, it would be far more compelling (and require less mental arithmetic), if it was marketed as “60 days free.” Sixty days is both easy to understand and easy to assign value to.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2062329\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2062329\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2062329\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Percentages.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"343\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Percentages.jpg 750w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Percentages.jpg?resize=150,76 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Percentages.jpg?resize=300,151 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Percentages.jpg?resize=680,343 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Percentages.jpg?resize=50,25 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2062329\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Disney+</p></div></p>\n<p><strong>Percentages may be harder to process or evaluate in isolation as an end user but they are easy to compare with each other i.e., we all know 25% off is better than 10% off.

Of course I&#8217;m playing devils advocate a little here.</strong></p>\n<p>So, it’s actually a really complex dilemma, and there’s no &#8220;easy&#8221; answer — this would probably make a great dinner time conversation. Yes, if you’re offering two discounts, then a percentage may be the easiest way for people to compare them.<div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=fd0IhX54SUs:KbJv41-eaaM:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=fd0IhX54SUs:KbJv41-eaaM:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=fd0IhX54SUs:KbJv41-eaaM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=fd0IhX54SUs:KbJv41-eaaM:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=fd0IhX54SUs:KbJv41-eaaM:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=fd0IhX54SUs:KbJv41-eaaM:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=fd0IhX54SUs:KbJv41-eaaM:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=fd0IhX54SUs:KbJv41-eaaM:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/fd0IhX54SUs\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 19 Oct 2020 17:25:51 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-19-at-15.12.06.png?w=680","linkMd5":"80d5bd36ed22a841aefc49fa6670affc","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn13@2020_1/2020/10/20/02-04-40-089_b9d05e8dd4646e29.webp","destWidth":680,"destHeight":364,"sourceBytes":16100,"destBytes":16100,"author":"Steve O'Hear","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-19-at-15.12.06.png?w=680":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn13@2020_1/2020/10/20/02-04-40-089_b9d05e8dd4646e29.webp","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Percentages.jpg?w=680":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn40@2020_3/2020/10/20/02-04-56-418_b1b0d796d7a40274.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn20@2020_2/2020/10/20/02-04-36-957_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn95@2020_6/2020/10/20/02-05-34-320_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn86@2020_4/2020/10/20/02-04-56-231_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=fd0IhX54SUs:KbJv41-eaaM:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn9@2020_2/2020/10/20/02-04-56-251_13f12277492e1e64.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=fd0IhX54SUs:KbJv41-eaaM:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn25@2020_6/2020/10/20/02-04-56-280_287a38ccd0dc089b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn27@2020_6/2020/10/20/02-05-09-402_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/fd0IhX54SUs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn60@2020_2/2020/10/20/02-04-56-871_6bb509069d45a4a2.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603159476459},{"createdTime":"2020-10-20 10:04:36","updatedTime":"2020-10-20 10:04:36","title":"Stitcher’s podcasts arrive on Pandora with acquisition’s completion","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2062366","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">SiriusXM today completed its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/13/siriusxm-buys-stitcher-for-325-million-steps-up-its-march-into-podcasts/\">previously announced $325 million acquisition</a> of podcast platform Stitcher from E.W.
