Head","link":"http://feeds.whowhatwear.com/~r/WhoWhatWear/~3/GEJjhfr9ohw/how-to-fix-bleached-hair-damage","description":"<p>Hello, my name is Erin Jahns, and I bleach the hell out of my hair. It's been going on for 15 years (I'm 26, and my first-ever color job was in fifth grade), and despite the amount of turmoil my strands have endured, I plan on being as <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/best-hair-color-for-my-skin-tone\" target=\"_blank\">blonde</a> as physically possible until my dying day. Or, at least, until my hair goes white—we'll see what happens first.</p><p>But first, some context. As a baby and through most of grade school, I was as blonde as blonde could be. Of course, at the time, I couldn't have cared less about the color of my hair, and if anything, I probably wanted blue, glitter-streaked highlights like the Spice Girls or edgy black lowlights à la Christina. The only reason I begged for highlights when I reached the fifth grade was that I thought I'd look \"glamorous\" (lol), and it's what all the cool girls were doing. So naturally, I begged my mom and dad for an appointment until my mom finally acquiesced and brought me along to her next salon appointment.</p><p>Peroxide zebra stripes were my first foray into the world of fake blonde hair, and from that day onward, I never went back. As I got older, my natural baby blonde turned into dirty dishwater, thus my foiling sessions became increasingly regular and increasingly hard on my hair. By the end of high school, I was asking colorists for full bleach and tones (so I was 100% bleached versus just heavily highlighted), and by the time I got to college, it's fair to say my hair was in a legitimately sorry state. Not horrible, but on the brink of disaster if I wasn't ultra careful with how I cared for and treated it. Am I doing a good job of foreshadowing my impending hair doom?</p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/282893/how-to-fix-bleached-hair-damage-282893-1570224351528-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p>Most people, at some point in their life, will have some kind of hair disaster. And while I had hoped I'd gotten mine out of the way in 1997 when my sister took me for a bowl cut at Kid's Hair, I wasn't so lucky. During my sophomore year of college, I experienced what my family, friends, and I refer to as \"The Bleach Apocolypse of 2013.\" After receiving a full head of highlights at a highly regarded salon in Minneapolis (where I'm from), I was left completely unhappy with the color. The end result was an ashy, mouse-like shade of brown with weird tones of blue and purple (probably from some kind of toning mishap), and I was beyond confused how the colorist had managed to stray so far from the bright, buttery-white blonde I'd always been.</p><p>In a panic, and because I had spent over $300 for said color, I begged her for options as to how she could fix it immediately. In hindsight, I should have sucked it up and sought out a different professional at another salon weeks later, but I had worked myself into a <em>state </em>and was completely desperate for an immediate solution. Also panicked (and a tad annoyed), the colorist told me the only way she could transform me into the bright blonde I wanted was to re-bleach <em>over</em> all of the highlights she had just foiled. (If you're cringing, you should be—that's legitimately the worst thing you can do to freshly weakened, colored hair, and her right to color hair should be revoked.) But, as I said, I was panicked and immediately accepted her offer even though she should have known better, apologized, and sent me home. </p><p>Fast-forward about one and a half hours later, and I was sitting in my car, bawling my eyes out with a wet, tangled, bleached-off disaster on top of my head. The bleaching was an entirely horrible idea and as the colorist washed my hair and attempted to comb through it, I watched in terror as fists of hair quite literally fell off my head. I know it might sound silly, and there are certainly larger world issues than a bleached hair disaster. At the time, I truly thought I was going to have to shave my head, and as much as I admire stars like Joey King, Charlize Theron, and Natalie Portman, I'm not an actress, and I don't have the cheekbones. </p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/282893/how-to-fix-bleached-hair-damage-282893-1570224366014-main.1200x1365uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p>Of course, the trials and tribulations I faced post-apocalypse are long and detailed enough for a novel, but long story short, I was, in the end, able to salvage my blonde hair. I poured hours and hours into research, babysitting check after babysitting check into rehabilitation products, and even more hours and babysitting checks at a different salon, getting trims, treatments, and consistent TLC. (The morning after the disaster I went to an Aveda salon where—I kid you not—I became a staff project and am still remembered to this day.)</p><p>It took about three years for my hair to bounce back, and up until a year or two ago—right around when I moved to L.A. to become a beauty editor—I was convinced my hair would never be the same. I still struggled to grow it out, and even though I had cut back on my highlight appointments (I think I went at least six months without getting so much as close to heat or peroxide post-trauma), colorists never seemed to get the tone right and my hair perpetually felt like straw.</p><p>Until, that is, I met my two fairy hair godparents, celebrity hairstylist <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/ext?tl=YXcjcroYeDLc_I_tR5JSVjKGk-Oi0_f-2nB5kAvOw39kMZxVqsxZLQLTeMbNKDPvSStTCc6CnC_PAOiyZg\" target=\"_blank\">Cervando Maldonado </a>and celebrity colorist <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/ext?tl=jO09gLwVf106CRUqmWAtTfAntqRCXEdjYPBL0FYwHwFzJju8yJWAiOlvFAT1H0NVP0kwe92FIprpAfMEU8w\" target=\"_blank\">Cassondra Kaeding</a>. I met Cervando week one of my job as assistant beauty editor for Byrdie, and (bless him to infinity) he's taken me under his wing and helped bring my hair to health and lengths I never thought possible as a blonde. He's the only one I've let touch my hair, style- and cut-wise, since arriving in L.A., and I credit his amazing snipping genius and practical hair tips (get yourself avocado or coconut oil and apply it to your ends as much as possible) for reviving my hair over the past two years.</p><p>That said, even though my cut and length were on the right track, I was still consistently frustrated with my color (even in as star-studded of a town as L.A.), and it wasn't until Maldonado introduced me to Kaeding at his West Hollywood salon, <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/ext?tl=K73CPcUGzKa6qisE2vrHQ2BPKe_og7Qc4dSI-MbI_nG9_cp3jkUrejFUxMTEj-kM29oYe1hTzuJX\" target=\"_blank\">454 North</a>, that I truly felt I had found my long-lost color soulmate. I've met countless celebrity colorists thanks to my day job, but Kaeding is one of <em>the</em> most sought-after colorists in the industry right now, and she's also a complete and utter perfectionist when it comes to her art, technique, and reputation as a colorist. In short, she's the only kind of person you want to entrust your fragile hair with.</p><p>Unlike that colorist back in 2013, Kaeding actually told me she wouldn't touch my hair with any kind of color during our initial appointment (she's all about integrity and refuses to administer any risky behavior that could weaken or damage susceptible strands) and despite my disappointment, I waited an additional three weeks on top of the 10 I'd already waited so she could wield her magic. And, wield she did. Not only did Kaeding give me the <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/blonde-hair-colors-for-every-skin-tone\" target=\"_blank\">best blonde hair</a> job of my entire 26 years, but she also kept literally every single hair on my head. My strands have never been so long or so blonde, and everyone I see and talk to (even other celebrity hairstylists and colorists) are truly in awe of how healthy my hair is despite how bleached it is. Kaeding is talented enough to create an enigma out of me, and I couldn't be more grateful. </p><p>To celebrate, and because I get so, SO many DMs and questions about how to fix bleached hair, I'm using my own experience as a forever blonde (I refer to myself as an unofficial official color expert) and Kaeding's <em>legitimate</em> expertise to provide a complete—and hopefully helpful—guide for blonde haircare below. Ahead, all of our combined best tips for how to care for and fix bleached, post-apocalyptic blonde hair. Keep scrolling!</p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/282893/how-to-fix-bleached-hair-damage-282893-1570224371400-main.1200x1365uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p>The very first order of business post-bleach-apocalypse back in 2013 was a haircut. The stylist I saw said that although they would give me a protein and moisture treatment to help stop the immediate breakage (my hair kept falling and falling), I would continue to shed, so the best thing I could do was to part with as much length as I could emotionally handle. Not only would the cut help even out the <em>look</em> of my hair, it would also help prevent further splits and snaps. At the time, he chopped my boob-length hair to my collarbones, and I was diligent about coming into the salon for trims every month or two.</p><p>Years later, my cadence is every three months or so, and I make sure to see the same stylist (Maldonado) who knows my hair's history and my goals for length and thickness. My hair has never been so long or as thick, and I attribute that in part to my consistency with trims—even if it's just a dusting off the ends prior to a coloring appointment (which Kaeding always recommends pre-bleach).</p><p>Please learn from my mistake here, and before you go in for color with a new professional, stop by the salon for a consultation. Not only will you get a feel for the colorist and see their other clients' hair, you'll also be able to make a game plan with them to ensure you get the exact color you want without sacrificing the health of your hair. As I mentioned above, the first time I was booked to see Kaeding, I was scheduled for an allover highlight, but when I went in to see her, she had me go home and grow out my hair for another three weeks and said I'd be better off getting a bleach and tone rather than highlights considering how blonde I wanted to be and how inconsistent I'd been with different colorists since being in L.A. </p><p>\"We decided to take the bleach and tone approach because during our consult you expressed that the color hadn't been quite right,\" she explains. \"There were some gold undertones you weren't fond of that needed to be eliminated, and your hair was in good enough condition. I knew that I would be able to go through, take my time, and get you to the desired bright blonde you have always wanted!\"</p><p>Again, please learn from my deadly error, and do a lot of research when searching for your perfect colorist and don't solely rely on a salon's name or owner. I've seen more colorists and been to more salons than I could count on my fingers and toes, and just because a salon is owned by a famous name or has a \"good reputation\" doesn't speak to every single stylist or colorist housed there. (Although I can vouch for everyone at 454 North—its team is heaven-sent.)</p><p>Even being in an industry city like L.A., I've had <em>some</em> pretty terrible experiences and some pretty terrible color. When I met Kaeding, it was like a breath of fresh air. She took her time, she was relaxed, and I felt safe in her hands. She also came recommended by Maldonado, whom I 110% trusted, and her Instagram showcases a lot of her work so I could rest assured she was well-versed in the color blonde I was hoping for. Bleaching is a really intense (and scientific) process, and going to the wrong person can be the do-or-die factor when it comes to both the color and integrity of your hair. </p><p>\"Bleaching is really tough,\" Kaeding agrees. \"It's easy to over-process the hair, which will cause extreme dryness or even breakage. My advice to other colorists is to take your time, do the work, and absolutely don’t rush. If both time and care are put into the application, your hair will stay healthier and longer, which means you can stay blonder longer.</p><p>\"What I did was coat the previously bleached, highlighted hair with Redken's <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/ext?tl=lqnPRfmJRpV3Bzq_lD1gM92rUI4qV-Ed-_FHq8Xls1YScUIDtC0ifY1B_P8vXiK0Z1Me5DWd2rwa\" target=\"_blank\">All Soft Heavy Cream Super Treatment Mask</a> ($22). This helps the new bleach I was going to be applying from overlapping onto the old, pre-lightened hair. I only applied bleach to the regrowth, and I put about a four-inch-long piece of cotton between each thin section, which acts as a barrier so the bleach doesn’t expand onto old blonde and also helps absorb any excess bleach.\"</p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/282893/how-to-fix-bleached-hair-damage-282893-1570224404961-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>If you want to have super-blonde and super-healthy hair, lots of heat styling just isn't in your foreseeable future. (Sorry!) I didn't TOUCH a blow-dryer or my beloved flat iron for months and months after my bleaching disaster, and unless I absolutely have to, I still airdry my hair whenever possible and avoid my collection of hot tools, which, Kaeding completely supports, especially right after you've done major color or bleach. \"It depends on the client's severity of breakage, but the best thing to do after your color appointment is to leave your hair alone,\" she confirms. \"Try not to do any more chemical processes until your colorist gives you the green light or tells you to come back in. Excessive bleaching will only worsen your hair's health, and you need to give it time to recover. Also avoid heat styling; using hot tools on damaged hair will cause more breakage.\" When I do blow-dry my hair, I use a high-quality dryer like this above from T3, which was created with your strands' health and integrity in mind. But most of the time, I work with hair-healthy leave-ins that encourage and enhance my natural texture—no wands or irons necessary. (The below spray from IGK is my fave.)</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/282893/how-to-fix-bleached-hair-damage-282893-1570224410720-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/282893/how-to-fix-bleached-hair-damage-282893-1570224418354-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>Not to wax poetic on the importance of not washing your hair every day, but… please don't wash your hair every day. I personally aim for about twice a week, which has been a game-changer as far as keeping my color vibrant and fresh in addition to expediting hair growth. Kaeding loves Redken's Color Extend Magnetics Shampoo ($39) and Conditioner ($39), which are sulfate-free (this is important!) and lightweight but packed with hydrating and strengthening ingredients to help your hair recover post–bleaching trauma.  As far as purple shampoo, both Kaeding and I recommend using as-needed. I won't purple my hair until two or three weeks post-color and only every couple of weeks thereafter. In fact, I have better luck with salon-quality clarifying treatments (like the below from Malibu C), which completely nix brassiness and discoloration instead of just counteracting with a violet shampoo formula. Ask your colorist what they'd prescribe as far as purple shampoo, but you probably need it less than you (and the hair product market!) think. Right now, I'm loving Amika's formula, which was a recommendation from a fellow platinum blonde at WWW HQ. (Thanks, Dev!)</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/282893/how-to-fix-bleached-hair-damage-282893-1570224421761-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/282893/how-to-fix-bleached-hair-damage-282893-1570224426293-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/282893/how-to-fix-bleached-hair-damage-282893-1570224431863-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>Surprise, surprise, don't follow my 2013 lead by pre-gaming a bleaching process with more bleaching. Instead, in the weeks prior to the big color appointment, you should flood your system with the essential vitamins, nutrients, and hydration to encourage healthy, strong strands.  \"Before a big bleach process, I like to tell clients to do a hair mask once a week, and to take hair vitamins to make sure your hair is healthy and strong,\" Kaeding tells me. \"Keep hydrated—what you put in your body does impact the state of your skin, nails, AND hair. Drink lots of water, and eat fruits and vegetables that are high in water content.\" I swear by Hum's vegan hair gummies (they've truly made a difference with how fast and long my hair has grown), but Nutrafol is another favorite among both myself and other A-list hair professionals I've talked to. And yes, I'm that annoying girl that makes it a personal goal to drink at least 80 ounces of water per day. But, I do think Kaeding is right; it actually makes a difference. I also eat really clean and make sure I get ample protein from high-quality sources (legumes, salmon, etc.) plus healthy fats from nuts, seeds, avocados, and the like. </figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/282893/how-to-fix-bleached-hair-damage-282893-1570224444499-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/282893/how-to-fix-bleached-hair-damage-282893-1591740009848-main.800x0uc.jpg\"><figcaption>I'll admit watching that colorist attempt to comb through my bleached-off hair all those years ago still gives me nightmares, and to this day, I baby the eff out of my hair. In addition to using my favorite products religiously, I also take painstaking care when it comes to detangling and brushing my hair. I strictly use a wide-tooth comb on damp hair, starting with my ends, and working my way up, and use my favorite Shine Enhancer brush from Wet Brush only when completely necessary on my dry strands. It's even gotten to the point where I bring my comb with me to any kind of hair or blowout appointment and insist the stylist use it to detangle—unpopular opinion, but it results in significantly less breakage and fallout than a Wet Brush or Tangle Teezer. </figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/282893/how-to-fix-bleached-hair-damage-282893-1570224462889-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p>Hair masks are a major part of bleached hair recovery, and I try to do one every single week (bearing in mind I only wash my hair twice a week), so basically every other wash. I rotate between Olaplex's <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/ext?tl=l1rSzVTwJ9tVlZk-E7xeTx2RQrjPnalXOKVaiiEwPMcM4XgkWhy_Ca65s-yRywCyNydrH6HwkzqB\" target=\"_blank\">Hair Perfector No. 3</a> ($28) and any of the seven formulas below depending on what my hair needs. If it feels like it's dry, I'll pick one that's more moisturizing; if I feel like it's weak and prone to snapping more than usual, I'll grab one that has more protein and is geared toward strengthening.</p><p>Kaeding is also on board with my hardcore masking habit and recommends a once-per-week cadence to her clients. She loves Redken's <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/ext?tl=ldc5Ckd6vQ-lELmjchwUWU_RC28Osu3u14EUV7MAoWeG4jfi2cQ0F0TyXd-G34d9Lk3PjolSbfRF\" target=\"_blank\">Color Extend Blondage Mask</a> ($29), which also helps brighten and maintain lightened hair.</p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/282893/how-to-fix-bleached-hair-damage-282893-1570224483285-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>I use Olaplex every other week to keep my strands strong and less prone to breakage. It needs to go on wet hair to be effective, and I'll often wrap my hair into a bun, go to work and the gym, then rinse it out before I shampoo and condition when I get home. </figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/282893/how-to-fix-bleached-hair-damage-282893-1570224500287-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>I haven't been using this mask as much recently, but I absolutely swear it has miraculous superpowers. Post-apocalypse, I practically wore it 24/7 and used it as a daily conditioner, leave-in, and mask. The name doesn't lie, and even years later, I haven't found too many formulas that can compete with it. </figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/282893/how-to-fix-bleached-hair-damage-282893-1570224504123-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>If you're looking for an affordable drugstore find that feels super luxurious and truly works wonders on damaged, bleached hair, I highly recommend this fan favorite from celebrity hairstylist Kristin Ess. It's deeply nourishing and helps build strength and stamina back into weakened strands. </figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/282893/how-to-fix-bleached-hair-damage-282893-1570224508777-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>This is one of the most iconic hair masks in the business and for good reason. Developed by legendary hair genius Christophe Robin himself, it's enriched with amazing luxe ingredients like prickly pear seed oil and inula flower extract to flood parched strands with moisture and repair any lingering damage that's compromising your growth goals. </figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/282893/how-to-fix-bleached-hair-damage-282893-1591740835405-main.800x0uc.jpg\"><figcaption>I've turned so many fellow blondes onto this protein-rich mask from Davines. It's so dreamy, and, I swear, legitimately glues broken strands back together again. That said, it IS potent, so make sure you don't let it marinate longer than the recommended 10 to 30 minutes, and don't use it more than every few weeks or so. I usually apply it monthly in lieu of conditioner for 15 minutes. Does the trick! </figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/282893/how-to-fix-bleached-hair-damage-282893-1570224517080-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>This was a recent Violet Grey find (along with my beloved Christophe Robin pick) that I've been really into lately and which has had a very positive impact on the softness and strength of my hair. It smells amazing (not a bad perk!) and utilizes the brand's signature Alpha Keratin 60ku complex to revive hair with shine, mega-hydration, and durability for more gloss and less snapping. </figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/282893/how-to-fix-bleached-hair-damage-282893-1591741014070-main.800x0uc.jpg\"><figcaption>How you choose to wrap and handle your hair when it's damp might seem innocent enough, but if you're pulling and yanking too aggressively or using the wrong materials, it can bear serious consequences. Instead of wrapping my hair with a heavy, frizz-promoting towel, I now only ever use these Microfiber Hair Turbans from Aquis. They're beloved within the beauty industry and promote faster drying time, more shine, longer-lasting color, and less breakage. Plus, they're lightweight and won't break your neck. </figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/282893/how-to-fix-bleached-hair-damage-282893-1570224524242-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>Folks, silk pillowcases are a game-changer, and I notice a significant difference with the breakage around my hairline if I'm without one (i.e. when I'm traveling or sleeping at a friend's or S.O.'s.) I recommend getting a few of these for a multitude of reasons: They do wonders for keeping hair smooth, and they prolong your style so you don't have to wash as often. </figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/282893/how-to-fix-bleached-hair-damage-282893-1570224529386-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>In the same vein, I swear by these big fluffy silk scrunchies. I pull my hair into a ponytail at the very tip-top of my head before tucking my ends through into a big floppy bun. I might look like Michelle Tanner, but I have less breakage and more shine than I did before starting the ritual. </figcaption></figure></p><p>Aside from shampoo, conditioner, masks, and my beloved air-dry spray (shown above from IGK), the only products I ever use in my hair are heat protecting and detangling leave-in conditioners, serums, and clear oils. After I unwrap my hair from the turban, I'll smooth a nickel-size amount of hair oil (always clear if you're blonde!) into the entire length of my hair, and then I'll spritz through with my leave-in. If I feel like my hair needs even more TLC, I might use another specialized serum or cream, but it's just as needed, and again, just depending on what my hair is feeling and looking like. My favorites are below!</p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/282893/how-to-fix-bleached-hair-damage-282893-1570224535692-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>I've used this lightweight clear oil from Verb for YEARS. I'm obsessed, and it's one of the first products I always recommend to anyone who has hair but especially for blondes. </figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/282893/how-to-fix-bleached-hair-damage-282893-1570224540191-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>This majestic marula oil–spiked elixir from Reverie is another all-time favorite. It's not greasy or heavy like so many oils out there and features exotic, nourishing, and color-protecting benefactors like crambe abyssinica seed oil for hydration and elasticity along with a dose of squalane for heat and color protection. </figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/282893/how-to-fix-bleached-hair-damage-282893-1570224590821-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>I'm obsessed with these drops from Oribe even though I don't use them every time I wash or style my hair. The customizability factor is genius (just add a few drops to whatever styling product you fancy), and they're chock-full of the essential nutrients parched just-bleached hair is starved for. (Think vitamins, linoleic acid, biotin, and sea kelp extract.)</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/282893/how-to-fix-bleached-hair-damage-282893-1570224607911-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>This is my be-all and end-all leave-in conditioner. I've tried SO many, but I come back to this one again and again since my initial bleaching disaster. It smells amazing, boasts heat protection, detangling prowess, and a ton of other benefits. It's also so lightweight and moisturizing that it's almost impossible to OD—even if you get a little carried away with spritzing. It turns straw strands into velvet. </figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/282893/how-to-fix-bleached-hair-damage-282893-1570224613106-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>Last but not least, don't forget your ends. I use this as needed in either damp or dry hair. Pea protein, hydrolized quinoa, and baobab seed oil work together to aid in heat protection, color enhancement, hydration, shine, and the sealing of decrepit split ends.  Up next: These 5 Colors Look Incredible on Blondes.

The brand makes multiple scents, but this is our favorite floral profile. In fact, the ingredients are so healing you can dab it on as an impromptu scar treatment.</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288927/best-solid-perfumes-288927-1599077950638-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288927/best-solid-perfumes-288927-1599077955034-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>Key fragrance notes: gardenia, tea leaves, sweet orange, and jasmine. Not only do we love this solid perfume thanks to its clean, nontoxic ingredients, but we also love it because it is easy on the wallet, is handbag ready, and is the next best thing to a tropical vacay in Tahiti. Plus, it will leave a pretty trail of shimmer wherever you choose to apply it. (It's amazing across the chest and over the collarbones!) </figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288927/best-solid-perfumes-288927-1599077957906-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288927/best-solid-perfumes-288927-1599077961937-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>Key fragrance notes: rose, lily, tuberose, and orange flower. Solid perfumes reign supreme when it comes to stunning packaging. We're beyond smitten with how vanity friendly this limited-edition perfume compact is from fragrance and beauty legend Estée Lauder. And the scent is just as covetable. (Think a rich bouquet starring all of your favorite flowers.)</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288927/best-solid-perfumes-288927-1599077967357-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288927/best-solid-perfumes-288927-1599077971851-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>Key fragrance notes: strawberry, vanilla, lavender, sage. To be completely honest, it feels impossible to choose just one solid perfume from Lush's drool-inducing array of natural and vegan scents. That said, we're partial to this retro-inspired fragrance which channels vintage-milkshake vibes thanks to strawberry, vanilla, lavender, and sage. </figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img

leaning heavily into <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/popular-swimsuits\" target=\"_blank\">swimwear</a> right now. Inspired by some of the best <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/swimwear-trends-2020\" target=\"_blank\">swimsuit trends</a> of the season, I’ve been trying out my favorite styles. While I’ve been wearing swimsuits for a backyard dip in the pool, I’ve also been experimenting by mixing swimwear into my everyday outfits—whether it’s a bikini top paired with high-waisted trousers or a sparkly bikini underneath a breezy linen dress.</p><p class=\"p1\">My style is part minimalist, part maximalist—and you’ll see evidence of both here. I often gravitate to the clean, classic lines of a solid <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/splash/zorxT7yBj?w=3705090\"><span class=\"s1\">one-shoulder swimsuit</span></a>, but you’ll also spot me wearing more high-drama items like a golden <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/ext?tl=okLAW-sWZLXCMk7BQsffAqVm_n9CwqUfUxl96oblKkyBnTwr2sSiQ1cp17Cl0Qov95SYYj86-jycMve985Sb6tMeKZsQyMsf8pEAC23FYQ1tcLH4Vp_0cqWobzlkQWp2o66AuM1XSx3SM7BvLQ\"><span class=\"s1\">ruched one-piece</span></a> from <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/isa-boulder-brand-review\"><span class=\"s1\">Isa Boulder</span></a> or an ‘80s-inspired ruffled swimsuit. Even when I keep things simple, though, I like to layer in jewelry like statement earrings or a chain necklace to add some dimension to the look. Ahead, see how I'm wearing the 7 swimsuit trends I can’t quit and shop my top edit.</p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288916/best-swimsuit-trends-288916-1599179874204-main.800x0uc.jpg\"><figcaption>I first spotted Indonesian brand Isa Boulder on Instagram earlier this year and instantly fell for their unique ruched swimsuits. Finished with underwire cups and a satin-like material, their designs are part of the larger lingerie-inspired swimwear trend we're seeing right now. While this is stunning to wear on its own, it also works as a great transitional piece to wear with trousers as we head into fall since lingerie pieces will be huge for the season ahead.</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288916/best-swimsuit-trends-288916-1599182155467-main.1301x1805uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288916/best-swimsuit-trends-288916-1599185649550-main.1400x1779uc.jpg\"><figcaption>Shop the matching Second Wave Bikini Bottoms ($40).</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288916/best-swimsuit-trends-288916-1599190432177-main.2000x3000uc.jpg\"><figcaption>Shop the matching Emma Bikini Briefs ($160).</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288916/best-swimsuit-trends-288916-1598943030402-main.1080x1350uc.jpg\"><figcaption>With the bra top trend in full swing, I've been adopting bikinis as tops for a look to wear beyond the pool or beach. Square necklines are the silhouette I've been gravitating to because of their clean lines that easily pass for a crop top. Here, I styled a top from Monday Swimwear with a pair of belted high-waist trousers and strappy sandals. Next month, I'd wear the same look but add a loose blazer and sleek ankle boots.</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288916/best-swimsuit-trends-288916-1598943186682-main.1366x2048uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288916/best-swimsuit-trends-288916-1599187393409-main.1280x1920uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288916/best-swimsuit-trends-288916-1599189765760-main.1128x2000uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288916/best-swimsuit-trends-288916-1599179208097-main.800x0uc.jpg\"><figcaption>One-shoulder swimsuits are the minimalist trend that has been everywhere this summer but I think the silhouette is only picking up steam. Moving into fall, we'll be seeing one-shoulder tops take off, so this is the perfect piece to wear later in place of a bodysuit. I particularly love this version from Jade Swim—it has a beautiful open back and a strap that wraps around from the side to the shoulder which you can see in the product shot below.</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288916/best-swimsuit-trends-288916-1599166246562-main.1391x1854uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288916/best-swimsuit-trends-288916-1599166194737-main.1001x1400uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288916/best-swimsuit-trends-288916-1599188411558-main.1128x2000uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288916/best-swimsuit-trends-288916-1599210325733-main.1127x1500uc.jpg\"><figcaption>High-shine lurex swimsuits have been around for a bit now, but seem to get more and more popular each season. Italian brand Oséree definitely put them on the map with their signature sparkly fabrics that glisten as they catch the sun. I love the subtle shine of this black bikini that adds just the right touch of glamour to an otherwise classic style.</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288916/best-swimsuit-trends-288916-1599162677710-main.1062x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288916/best-swimsuit-trends-288916-1599166061160-main.800x0uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288916/best-swimsuit-trends-288916-1599170875882-main.800x0uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288916/best-swimsuit-trends-288916-1599162358144-main.800x0uc.jpg\"><figcaption>One of the most unique swimsuit shapes on my radar? Sleeved versions. I've really fallen hard for this fresh take on swimwear that stands out from the rest. Here, I'm wearing a set from Same Swim that has a rash guard top and high-rise bottoms. Though the design takes inspiration from vintage pieces with its covered buttons and contrast trim, the long sleeves instantly make it feel modern.</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288916/best-swimsuit-trends-288916-1599163495590-main.1200x1374uc.jpg\"><figcaption>Shop the matching Grace High-Rise Bottoms ($110).</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288916/best-swimsuit-trends-288916-1599166569654-main.933x1399uc.jpg\"><figcaption>Shop the matching Hip Hug Bottoms ($45).</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288916/best-swimsuit-trends-288916-1599190823097-main.800x0uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288916/best-swimsuit-trends-288916-1599162353507-main.2320x3088uc.jpg\"><figcaption>I can never resist a great '80s reference, so ruffle swimsuits are winning me over right now.

misattributed quote (Marilyn Monroe? Bette Midler? We may never know) we love returning to: “Give a girl the right shoes, and she can conquer the world.” While we’re partial to believing that someone can conquer the world regardless of footwear, having the perfect pair of shoes certainly can’t hurt.</p><p>One of the keys to the <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/how-to-clean-suede-boots\" target=\"_blank\">perfect pair of shoes</a> is keeping them clean, clear, and scuff-free. Whether you’re looking to shine up your favorite pair of <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/how-to-clean-patent-leather\" target=\"_blank\">patent leather</a> pumps or <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/flats-with-arch-support\" target=\"_blank\">everyday flats</a>, here are five of our favorite methods on how to remove scuff marks from shoes, using a handful of items you likely already have on hand.</p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/249660/how-to-remove-scuff-marks-from-shoes-249660-1599085286608-main.1200x1365uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><span>Unless your shoes contain a <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/how-to-clean-white-vans\" target=\"_blank\">fabric</a> that’s likely to be on the dry clean–only list—satin, for example—a small amount of </span><span>gentle laundry detergent</span><span> can offer the perfect fix. Mix a few drops of detergent in a small amount of lukewarm water, then use a clean cloth to dab the scuff marks. Once they’ve been removed, wipe away any residue with a second clean cloth.</span></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/249660/how-to-remove-scuff-marks-from-shoes-249660-1519345055553-main.1200x1365uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/249660/how-to-remove-scuff-marks-from-shoes-249660-1599085302828-main.1200x1365uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><span>While most mistakes can’t simply be erased, scuff marks on shoes are thankfully an exception. After testing a less conspicuous area of a shoe, use circular motions to gently buff the scuff marks with an eraser. This method works especially well for vinyl and <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/how-to-clean-white-leather-shoes\" target=\"_blank\">patent leather shoes</a>.

Apply a small amount of nail polish remover to a cotton ball, then polish the scuff marks using focused, circular motions. Again, testing on a less noticeable section of the shoe beforehand is always wise, but this method tends to work well for a variety of fabrics and types of shoes, from patent leather heels to <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/how-to-clean-white-sneakers\" target=\"_blank\">basic sneakers</a>.</span></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/249660/how-to-remove-scuff-marks-from-shoes-249660-1519345456901-main.1200x1365uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/249660/how-to-remove-scuff-marks-from-shoes-249660-1599085320723-main.1200x1365uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><span>It’s no secret that baking soda has a wide range of cleaning applications, and you can add removing scuff marks from shoes to the list. Combine a small amount of baking soda (1 to 2 tablespoons should do the trick) with warm water. Mix the paste to an even consistency, then apply directly to the scuff marks. Use a cloth to polish the shoes, then remove the residue with a second clean cloth.</span></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/249660/how-to-remove-scuff-marks-from-shoes-249660-1519345615025-main.1200x1365uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/249660/how-to-remove-scuff-marks-from-shoes-249660-1599085337490-main.1200x1365uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><strong><span>Harnessing the same technology as baking soda, toothpaste can be used to achieve similar results.

of my job is essentially to shop for others while I source the market for top-notch buys, my friends often tap me for sartorial guidance in regards to <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/best-nordstrom-shopping\" target=\"_blank\">what’s worth buying for the season</a>. One of the key members in my inner circle routinely shops at <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/ext?tl=4LmV4LYGJ8PZRDTt79RHrHzk1uBlPLH8tgjDb6w3hmnAOXHUF2vtDAozmFAim4un2ILEjxEq5gpxI83kw8mQDdkEmq-VFuyj0mkDQncdClyHgQWeg3W_3fYDicYN30YluF_mJm1O1xlt39q-03jLPTxqbyPizw\" target=\"_blank\">Nordstrom</a>, in particular, when she's shopping given the mega-retailer’s wide assortment of <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/fall-basics-nordstrom\" target=\"_blank\">basics</a>, trendy items, and coveted shoes. So when she asked me for a few items she should consider for the season, I played Nordstrom personal shopper and sent her five specific fall items.</p><p>Naturally, I thought you could be interested in the pieces in question, so I’m sharing the items I added to my friend’s cart below. I also took it a step further and did a deep dive through the rest of the new arrivals, and rounded up 20 other noteworthy pieces. Keep scrolling for more—you may just uncover a few fresh items to mix into your fall wardrobe.</p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288850/best-fall-fashion-nordstrom-288850-1598547361331-main.1560x2392uc.jpg\"><figcaption>An oversize blouse gives off quite a directional vibe teamed with jeans or leggings.</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288850/best-fall-fashion-nordstrom-288850-1598547493711-main.800x0uc.jpg\"><figcaption>Toss this slouchy blazer over anything for a polished silhouette.</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288850/best-fall-fashion-nordstrom-288850-1598547528308-main.800x0uc.jpg\"><figcaption>It's all about chunky flat boots this season.</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288850/best-fall-fashion-nordstrom-288850-1598548248536-main.800x0uc.jpg\"><figcaption>Fashion editors love these jeans—and I know my friend will as well.</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288850/best-fall-fashion-nordstrom-288850-1598551421088-main.800x0uc.jpg\"><figcaption>I also told my friend to try the coordinating jogger pants too.</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288850/best-fall-fashion-nordstrom-288850-1598547358012-main.800x0uc.jpg\"><figcaption>Bring extra dimension to those cozy fall 'fits.</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288850/best-fall-fashion-nordstrom-288850-1598549624366-main.800x0uc.jpg\"><figcaption>Add texture to an elevated fall ensemble with this faux-suede skirt.</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288850/best-fall-fashion-nordstrom-288850-1598549658938-main.800x0uc.jpg\"><figcaption>A chic basic to wear on its own or layered.</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288850/best-fall-fashion-nordstrom-288850-1598551917876-main.800x0uc.jpg\"><figcaption>Picture this midi skirt with a chunky knit and boots.</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288850/best-fall-fashion-nordstrom-288850-1598551671383-main.800x0uc.jpg\"><figcaption>Just can't go wrong with a checked blazer.</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288850/best-fall-fashion-nordstrom-288850-1598549642367-main.800x0uc.jpg\"><figcaption>Simple yet timeless.</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288850/best-fall-fashion-nordstrom-288850-1598551480340-main.800x0uc.jpg\"><figcaption>Forward comfy pants, anyone?</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288850/best-fall-fashion-nordstrom-288850-1598549673571-main.800x0uc.jpg\"><figcaption>Just in case you're in the market for a comfortable striped sweater.</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288850/best-fall-fashion-nordstrom-288850-1598551489894-main.800x0uc.jpg\"><figcaption>So many things right here—from the mid-calf silhouette to the square toe.</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288850/best-fall-fashion-nordstrom-288850-1598549722987-main.800x0uc.jpg\"><figcaption>Pair this sweater with your favorite jeans, and you're set.</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288850/best-fall-fashion-nordstrom-288850-1598549574955-main.800x0uc.jpg\"><figcaption>It's almost sweater dress season.</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288850/best-fall-fashion-nordstrom-288850-1598551635012-main.800x0uc.jpg\"><figcaption>I'm very into the idea of wearing this floral dress with chunkier boots.</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288850/best-fall-fashion-nordstrom-288850-1598551737532-main.800x0uc.jpg\"><figcaption>These popular leggings are no-fail.</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288850/best-fall-fashion-nordstrom-288850-1598551779005-main.800x0uc.jpg\"><figcaption>There's a reason why these have 4.6 out of 5 stars—perfect black booties.</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288850/best-fall-fashion-nordstrom-288850-1598549736550-main.800x0uc.jpg\"><figcaption>The contrasting fabric on the back is a nice touch.</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288850/best-fall-fashion-nordstrom-288850-1598549751829-main.800x0uc.jpg\"><figcaption>Wear this short-sleeve knit as is now or under a blazer when it's chiller outside.</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288850/best-fall-fashion-nordstrom-288850-1598551703239-main.800x0uc.jpg\"><figcaption>Need new kicks?

The newest generation of designers who have started brands in the last few years all seem to share a sense of responsibility to the planet and whatever community they're a part of. This often means smaller brands with environmentally conscious production methods, and sometimes, it also means a mission statement aimed at deconstructing the industry as it stands. Toronto's Tyrell Harriott is no different. He launched <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/ext?tl=8Yk-omXEYo4S-5U_IbQoEGLWc4r_xXhWrUwuuTyqpyFI_LAk\" target=\"_blank\">his eponymous label</a> three years ago when he graduated from college and saw no space that suited him in Toronto's design world. So he made space for himself.</p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288860/tia-adeola-review-1-288860-1598580298021-main.1200x1718uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p>In Harriott's design world, luxury is turned on its head, and feminity takes on a whole new meaning. I've seen his barely-there designs lauded for their \"heavy femininity\" and the statements they inherently make on how sensual a woman's body is typically allowed to be. Though Harriott is cutting holes and shortening hemlines to reveal the female silhouette, how much skin ultimately gets shown is up to the wearer, for his designs are often adjustable. Dresses can be made shorter, and bralette-shrug sets can be worn as separates. That versatility isn't just a tool for empowering women to have control over how much of their bodies they want to reveal. It's also multipurpose. Harriott wants his designs to take women from their day into their night.</p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288860/tia-adeola-review-1-288860-1598580314130-main.1200x1803uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p>The bralette set is already popular among It girls like <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/ext?tl=15CGGLkXBQoSXcJqID-QleodqLf2fXwN6i8auBJOOmWhEJcqwlTX04vQJOyxqy6kbDKPaijNnOM\" target=\"_blank\">Amy Julliette Lefévre</a> and <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/ext?tl=o7gsPphIrQXLWv-WD5Rbjfv2-EJCDmWP74BZIzokBJU75cNgqiEQNG1-DkRkgwbceumgqnEfSq4\" target=\"_blank\">Anajah</a>. The six designs Harriott currently sells are all made to order from deadstock fabrics. It's a statement about production: How are luxury items produced, for whom, and with what intention? With raw hemlines, cutouts, itty-bitty straps, and see-through mesh, it's clear he's telling a younger, more radically feminine customer base that made to order is no longer a status symbol but a political message—one that encourages slowing down, paying attention to where our money is going, and dictating how the world gets to perceive us. Keep reading to hear from the man himself.</p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288860/tia-adeola-review-1-288860-1598580329288-main.1200x1803uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><strong>Tell us about yourself and your business.</strong></p><p>My name is Tyrell Harriott. I studied fashion design at George Brown College here in Toronto, Canada, and wasn't very inspired by the fashion that was happening in my city, so I created Tyrell. I launched it with the intention to make sensual clothes for destinations and create our own vacations every day. I want to design clothes that are striking enough to make memories.</p><p>The core of my brand is that you can wear every piece in different ways. I feel clothes should be able to have multiple personalities, and I try to show that in my brand. An important goal for me is to keep my business as conscious as possible, and how I do that is by making each piece to order out of deadstock fabrics. It's always been really important to me to make sure my brand can operate during a time when that's something consumers think about.</p><p><strong>And if you had to sum up your business in five words or less?</strong></p><p>Girl, where we going?</p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288860/tia-adeola-review-1-288860-1598580336756-main.1200x1803uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><strong>What inspired you to start your business?</strong></p><p>I went to Paris in late 2016 and was inspired by the people, the stores, and the women! It put a vision of a specific woman in my mind that I really wanted to design for. After coming back and graduating, I was super ready to make a collection of items I loved. I did a fashion show in 2017 in Toronto that forced me to recreate what had been stuck in my head for a while. I made it to sharpen my portfolio, but when I couldn't find anything that inspired me in my city, I started my eponymous brand Tyrell. I felt it just made sense, and I got to create my own little world that felt outside of Toronto but still in it.</p><p><strong>How have social distancing and stay-at-home orders affected your business? How have your priorities shifted?</strong></p><p>Social distancing and stay-at-home orders affected my business for the better, really. I mean I had a lot on my plate pre-COVID, and it was forcibly cleared once lockdown started. Not basing off the wholesale model and being mainly e-commerce, we weren't impacted by that part of the business. We're a small team that does the job using a direct-to-consumer model, so I really didn't have any middle man in the supply chain that couldn't get the job done. I was able to put all of my focus and energy into my brand, which I wasn't able to completely do before, so it's allowed me to do a higher volume of orders since all the pieces are made to order.</p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288860/tia-adeola-review-1-288860-1598580345415-main.1200x800uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><strong>What are two to three of your favorite brands you like to support and why?</strong></p><p>I Iove spotlight love!

Well, I try to think of them as my peers, being black-owned businesses also, but I think what they do is really needed in this time of redefining what is luxury!</p><p><strong>What has been your proudest moment as a business owner?</strong></p><p>The proudest moment I had as a business owner was honestly getting my first stockist at a boutique I had always loved from afar and now am a part of. It's super cool.

I'm 27 with nary a line or wrinkle on my face, and while I harness a sponge-like talent for absorbing any and all skincare intel, (and I obviously proceed to share every single vetted tidbit I soak-up with you all!), I leave the serious advice to the experts—especially concerning topics like skincare chemistry or the most efficacious ingredients to treat certain <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/how-to-treat-common-skincare-concerns\" target=\"_blank\">skin conditions</a> or benefit <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/best-skincare-products-for-every-skin-type/slide2\" target=\"_blank\">certain skin types</a>.

It helps smooth out the skin while also reducing visible wrinkles, lines, enlarged pores, brown spots, and even scarring from acne</strong>.\" </p><p><strong>How to use it like a pro:</strong> Always use retinol at night and apply a thin layer to your face after you cleanse and tone and before you add your moisturizer. Since retinol can trigger irritation (especially if you have sensitive skin), skin professionals recommend starting with a twice-per-week usage, gradually increasing to three or four days a week as your skin grows more tolerant. \"<strong>Patients with darker skin tend to be more prone to skin discoloration, so retinol needs to be introduced into their regimen slowly to allow the skin to accommodate to avoid irritation</strong>,\" Spann clarifies.</p><p>Additionally, Libby suggests opting for a \"retinol sandwich\" for anyone who is especially concerned about irritation or sensitivity. First, apply moisturizer, followed by your retinol, and then your moisturizer again. </p><p><strong>Helpful hint:</strong> \"Some initial dryness can occur in formulas with concentrations of 1% or higher, but not all formulas are made equally,\" Rouleau clarifies. If you notice sensitivity or irritation, she recommends looking for a gentler formula and also reminds us that <strong>retinol is not recommended if you're nursing or pregnant</strong>.

Apply your product as directed on the packaging, following your cleansing and toning ritual. </p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288584/best-anti-aging-ingredients-288584-1597253046775-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>What the celeb facialist says: \"I'm a big fan of incorporating astaxanthin as a nighttime serum to renew and replenish your skin while you sleep,\" says Rouleau. \"After cleansing and toning, apply one pump to the entire face and follow with a nighttime moisturizer.\"</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288584/best-anti-aging-ingredients-288584-1597253055953-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288584/best-anti-aging-ingredients-288584-1597253061234-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288584/best-anti-aging-ingredients-288584-1597253069180-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><strong>Why it's an anti-aging superstar:</strong> \"Niacinamide is a water-soluble form of vitamin B3 that boosts ceramide levels in the skin, improving the skin's ability to hold on to moisture,\" says Rouleau. \"<strong>It works by stimulating circulation in the dermis through a process known as vasodilation, and it can reduce the yellow-ish look to the face caused by the glycation of proteins, which is a common visible effect of aging due to environmental damage</strong>. Niacinamide also serves as an antioxidant to protect cells, membranes, and tissues from free radical attacks and can even reduce discoloration (brown spots and post-breakout scars) by preventing the transfer of melanosomes from melanocytes to the keratinocytes. Lastly, niacinamide offers anti-breakout and anti-bacterial benefits to reduce blemish activity.\"</p><p><strong>How to use it like a pro:</strong> Since niacinamide can be found in a variety of products (and you can safely apply it any time of the day), it's best to use your product as instructed. </p><p><strong>Helpful hint:</strong> \"While there are no known side effects associated with niacinamide, some people can experience some redness when using the ingredient in high percentages,\" notes Rouleau. She explains this is likely due to niacinamide's vasodilation process, therefore, you'll want to tread carefully and monitor your skin during the first few applications as you would with any other new addition to your routine. </p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288584/best-anti-aging-ingredients-288584-1597253118206-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>What the celeb facialist says: \"I love this moisturizing toner with niacinamide,\" Rouleau explains. \"After cleansing, wipe it over your face and leave it damp before proceeding with the next product in your routine. By leaving it damp on your face, it delivers moisture into the skin, and because the formula is water-based, it can act as a carrier for a serum applied afterward to be delivered deeper and more effectively to the skin.\"</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288584/best-anti-aging-ingredients-288584-1597253084296-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288584/best-anti-aging-ingredients-288584-1597253091517-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288584/best-anti-aging-ingredients-288584-1597253096740-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><strong>Why it's an anti-aging superstar:</strong> \"Peptides are long or short chains of amino acids, which are the building blocks of protein that send signals to your cells to make more collagen and thicken the support structure of the skin,\" Rouleau explains. \"Peptides are able to remain intact as they enter the skin's cells and they primarily function as moisture-binding agents. <strong>Plus, nearly all types of peptides have cell-communicating capabilities that send signals to the skin to repair itself. It's an especially strategic ingredient to incorporate if you're looking for firmer, more refined-looking skin</strong>.\"</p><p>According to Rouleau, the most beneficial types of peptides to look for within your products include palmitoyl tripeptide-38 (one of the most well-researched peptides on the market), palmitoyl oligopeptide, palmitoyl tetrapeptide-7, acetyl hexapeptide, palmitoyl pentapeptide, dipeptide-2, and caprooyl tetrapeptide.\"</p><p><strong>How to use it like a pro:</strong> Peptides can be used safely at any time of the day, so it's best to follow the directions your product provides. </p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288584/best-anti-aging-ingredients-288584-1597253105851-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>What the celeb facialist says: \"Peptides are especially great for the eye area, and eye creams can be used both day or night,\" Rouleau shares. \"Apply a thin layer around the outer corners of the eyes known as the 'crow’s feet' and be careful not to get it too close to the lashes, as you don’t want it to seep into your eyes.\"</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288584/best-anti-aging-ingredients-288584-1597253128603-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288584/best-anti-aging-ingredients-288584-1597253137654-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288584/best-anti-aging-ingredients-288584-1597253143230-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><strong>Why it's an anti-aging superstar:</strong> \"Vitamin C is an important antioxidant that scavenges free radical and environmental damage that has compromised the skin,\" notes Devgan. <strong>\"It helps to even out discoloration, fade brown spots, and improve lines.\"</strong></p><p><strong>How to use it like a pro:</strong> Citing data that suggests vitamin C may improve the absorption of retinol, Devgan recommends saving your daily dose of this potent anti-aging ingredient for the evening. Additionally, Robinson notes that while vitamin C is one of the best anti-aging ingredients for most skin types, those who are sensitive (again) should apply their formula at night and should start with lower concentrations. Then, once your skin has acclimated, or you know you're not having any reactions, he suggests graduating to twice-per-day (morning and night) applications and testing higher-dose formulas.</p><p><strong>Helpful hint:</strong> \"Vitamin C is an unstable ingredient, so look for stabilized versions,\" Robinson warns. BeautyStat's <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/ext?tl=K8PZp4q8Vp1Kc6g5zV8jj69xYnBOq1lGbB-f6NHbb4BiSWYcpKOQilSmulhDZozstK3GptmXa-qB\" target=\"_blank\">Universal C Skin Refiner</a> has three patents due to its ability to stabilize pure vitamin C in a way where it won't oxidize—it stays pure and potent from the first drop to the last. You can use it morning and/or night, just be sure to follow it up with SPF if you opt for a morning application.\"</p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288584/best-anti-aging-ingredients-288584-1597253152653-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>What the derm says: \"One product I particularly like for my patients is PCA Skin's C&E Advanced,\" Spann shares. \"It also provides additional antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and discoloration-fighting ingredients silymarin and hexylresorcinol, and it's highly stable, effective, and contains calming ingredients that make it appropriate for a wide variety of patients to build collagen and even out skin tone.\"</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288584/best-anti-aging-ingredients-288584-1597253159155-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288584/best-anti-aging-ingredients-288584-1597253166761-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288584/best-anti-aging-ingredients-288584-1597253175269-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><strong>Why it's an anti-aging superstar:</strong> \"When it comes to the best ingredients for anti-aging, number one always should be sun protection,\" clarifies Libby. \"As a skin cancer surgeon, I love the saying, 'An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.' I am seeing more and more young patients come in with skin cancers, either from a history of tanning bed use or an increase in recreational sun exposure. We are lucky that we now know how important and beneficial SPF is for both protection against UV damage (which can lead to skin cancers) as well as prevention against premature aging and unwanted pigmentation. <strong>Mineral-based sunscreens are my go-to, and the AAD recommends using a formula that has an SPF 30 or higher, is water-resistant, and boasts broad-spectrum protection against both UVA and UVB</strong>.\"</p><p><strong>How to use it like a pro:</strong> According to Libby, a good rule of thumb is to apply your skincare products from thinnest to thickest. In the morning, after you cleanse, start with your serum, follow that with a moisturizer, and lastly, add your SPF. </p><p><strong>Helpful hint:</strong> Even though any kind of SPF is better than nothing, Libby says she typically prefers <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/best-zinc-oxide-sunscreens\" target=\"_blank\">mineral sunscreens</a> as they are especially helpful for those who have sensitive skin, are pregnant, or who <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/how-to-treat-common-skincare-concerns\" target=\"_blank\">conditions like melasma</a>. </p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288584/best-anti-aging-ingredients-288584-1597253191710-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>What the derm says: \"One product I have been loving is Glytone's Hydra Lipid UV Mineral SPF 40+,\" Libby tells us. \"It's formulated using a powerful antioxidant complex with vitamins C and E, as well as moisturizers like hyaluronic acid and squalane. It's the ultimate multitasking SPF.\"</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288584/best-anti-aging-ingredients-288584-1597253196642-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288584/best-anti-aging-ingredients-288584-1597253211319-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288584/best-anti-aging-ingredients-288584-1597253216794-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><strong>Why it's an anti-aging superstar:</strong> \"Ceramides are key components of the skin barrier, and when there aren't enough, skin conditions like eczema, dryness, and irritation can occur,\" Libby explains. \"<strong>As we age, ceramide levels in our skin naturally decrease, and by the time we are 30, almost 40% of our skin’s ceramides are depleted, and by the time we are 40, that number increases to 60%. That said, we can help counteract this by adding them back into our skin to help re-fortify our skin's moisture barrier</strong>. When our skin is adequately moisturized and hydrated, it appears firmer, healthier, plumper, and overall less lined and wrinkled.\"</p><p><strong>How to use it like a pro:</strong> Just like other ingredients like antioxidants, hyaluronic acid, etc., ceramides are safe to use for all and can be added to your regimen to help promote healthy skin and reverse any damage that has been done. You can find them in plenty of different formulas (typically creams) and it's recommended you follow the product's specific application protocol for best results. </p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288584/best-anti-aging-ingredients-288584-1597253223639-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>What the derm says: \"I love using Cetaphil's Ultra-Healing Lotion which is packed with ceramides and other nourishing ingredients for my face and body,\" Libby shares. \"I apply this immediately after the shower to help seal in moisture, and I find that it is rich enough to hydrate my skin in the winter while still being lightweight to use year-round as well.\"</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288584/best-anti-aging-ingredients-288584-1597253229090-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288584/best-anti-aging-ingredients-288584-1597253234754-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><strong>Super-expensive moisturizers:</strong> According to Libby, there are plenty of affordably priced moisturizers on the market and there is actually little need to splurge. Of course, you can ultimately decide where you choose to invest within your skincare routine, but she recommends using your hard-earned dollars for antioxidant-containing formulas like your vitamin C products. (She notes that stable—aka, the most effective—vitamin C products, are harder to formulate and are therefore more expensive. Skinceuticals <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/ext?tl=FhEwfUI8Nigb4pXnqAVheq6vFtMIlU1bKWWyss-ERcwug4bSdS2fv4Uaz8QEayVPS8Gr1H6_6XN5\" target=\"_blank\">Phloretin CF</a> $166 is her top recommendation.) </p><p><strong>Products with ineffective ingredient proportions</strong>: Spann reveals that many skincare companies will tout that a product contains a particular ingredient, when in fact, there is a very small percentage of that ingredient in their formula. \"It is important to be certain that key anti-aging ingredients are used at the levels at which they were tested for efficacy,\" she heeds. \"Also, more isn't always better. There are ingredients—like peptides and hyaluronic acid—that are used at low percentages to achieve amazing results. Using more of something does not always indicate better outcomes.\"</p><p><strong>Overexaggerated claims:</strong> As we talk about quite often on Who What Wear, it's always important to take marketing, product, and specific ingredient claims with a grain of salt. Because, as Devgan confirms, a lot of ingredients have overstated claims. She cites <strong>creams targeted toward stretch marks</strong> as one of the most likely offenders, and she's also wary of <strong>facial oils</strong> because while they <em>may</em> improve the barrier of the skin, their molecules are too large to truly hydrate the skin from within. Plus, she notes, they can also clog pores and lead to congestion. Last but not least, Devgan says <strong>large-fragment facial scrubs</strong> can be extremely rough and damaging to the skin texture, and <strong>chemical peels</strong> should be left to the professionals and not executed at home.</p><p><em>Next: <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/best-anti-aging-skincare-lines\" target=\"_blank\">Experts Reveal the 18 Best Skincare Brands to Unlock

Over","link":"http://feeds.whowhatwear.com/~r/WhoWhatWear/~3/OVvBqKeheTA/levis-ribcage-jeans","description":"<p>We've already shared the magic of the <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/best-affordable-jeans-for-women\" target=\"_blank\">$98 jeans a stylist always suggests to celebs</a>, but there's a brand-new shape that launched in recent years, and it's already a hit among the stylish NYC crowd (and this L.A. editor).</p><p>Aptly dubbed the Ribcage style, the jeans offer the highest rise on any Levi's to date—and at 12 1/8 inches, the ribcage-grazing waistline puts other high-waisted jeans on the market to shame. The name makes them a bit daunting, I realize, but once threw on my pair and buttoned them up past belly button, it became immediately clear that these were the most flattering (and affordable!) jeans I had ever thrown on.</p><p>It turns out they were designed to fit that way, according to Global Chief Product Officer Karyn Hillman. \"Authentic look and feel inspired by a '90s Levi's 501 with the modern amplified rise is so flattering—perfectly styled high or low,\" she says. Now that the dark-wash pair are a permanent part of my wardrobe (scroll down to see them on), I can't stop telling my friends to add them to their own personal wardrobes.</p><p>Scroll down to see how I'm wearing the jeans, along with the NYC girls who adore them, too, and then shop the current Ribcage styles to add to your closet.</p><p><figure><img

href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/tags/summer-beauty\" target=\"_blank\">summer</a> slipping by faster than usual? As a beauty editor, my spidey senses start tingling at the onset of any <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/summer-beauty-products\" target=\"_blank\">seasonal shift</a> because it signals the need to purge my vanity of any products that no longer serve my <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/natural-makeup-looks\" target=\"_blank\">makeup</a>, skincare, and <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/best-body-care-products\" target=\"_blank\">bodycare</a> needs in exchange for ones that will ride with me in the months to come. But the transition from summer to fall is probably the most drastic course correction I make all year since environmental conditions make the most dramatic leap from hot and balmy to cold and dry.</p><p>With fall on the horizon, there's more to consider than which <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/best-fall-sweaters-on-amazon\" target=\"_blank\">cozy layers</a> we'll add to our wardrobes. We have to start thinking about which swaps we'll be making in our beauty wardrobes, too. Cooler temperatures mean the oil-sopping ingredients we held close all summer will take a back seat to ultra-hydrating formulas that will support us through snowstorms (I've heard from my colleagues in New York that those are a thing), hot showers, and an overall dip in moisture in the air. This time can bring on some major <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/dry-skin-in-winter\" target=\"_blank\">dry-skin woes</a>, but with the right fall beauty products in tow, we can get through it looking and feeling moisturized and unbothered.</p><p>Ahead, check out the eight beauty products I'll be packing away with my swimsuits and sandals and the eight fall-ready picks I'm boosting to the top of my routine.</p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288962/summer-to-fall-beauty-swaps-288962-1599091829008-image.1200x1365uc.jpg\"><figcaption>F is for fall… and full coverage. Summertime always feels like the perfect season to let our skin shine through sheer formulas, but as the weather cools, I tend to start leaning into more-corrective makeup to help smooth out my complexion. Since we're moving out of vacation season, luminous foundations that offer that lit-from-within glow are just perfect for looking glowy, not greasy. </figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288962/summer-to-fall-beauty-swaps-288962-1599157113213-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>There's a reason this foundation has a cult following all over the world. When it comes to glowy foundations that have a soft, natural finish but still cover up blemishes and imperfections, this one is a winner. It offers medium coverage, but it can certainly be built upon if you need a bit more. </figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288962/summer-to-fall-beauty-swaps-288962-1599107900642-main.800x0uc.jpg\"><figcaption>This drugstore foundation is one of my favorites across all price points. The name tells you everything you need to know about what to expect: glowy, natural-looking, and radiant skin. I love that my face feels comfortable and hydrated under this formula and that it doesn't break down into a greasy mess, even when I've loaded up on my favorite fall moisturizers underneath.</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288962/summer-to-fall-beauty-swaps-288962-1599108649400-main.1200x1365uc.jpg\"><figcaption>I'm a lip-gloss lover year round, but once fall hits I'm always ready to amp it up in the color department. A muted, diffused finish is cute for summer, but it's all about vinylic shine and high-impact color once we hit the -ber months. </figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288962/summer-to-fall-beauty-swaps-288962-1599157123543-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>The time has come to officially crown this as my favorite prestige gloss of all time. Yeah, I said it! It is so good. It covers the lips completely in an opaque varnish but doesn't feel overly sticky or oppressively thick. This shade, in particular, is such a beautiful nude for those with darker skin tones. </figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288962/summer-to-fall-beauty-swaps-288962-1599157131134-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>This silky lip gloss is a dream to wear. It's deceptively soft, and based on how it feels, you really wouldn't think it would deliver the level of pigment that it does. This might be the one and only scenario where being fooled is totally fine with me.</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288962/summer-to-fall-beauty-swaps-288962-1599092699174-image.1200x1365uc.jpg\"><figcaption>Don't get me wrong, I love colorful eyeliner. It's so fun and really adds a lot to a look. That said, fall is the time when richer lip colors come out to play, so eyeliner needs to stay a little more neutral so it doesn't compete. Lip liner can help to create a more polished and precise lip, especially when working with a bold color.</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288962/summer-to-fall-beauty-swaps-288962-1599157140725-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>I never loved a lip liner until I met this one. It glides on so beautifully and makes a huge difference when carrying out beauty adventures like overlining. </figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288962/summer-to-fall-beauty-swaps-288962-1599157183222-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>It's officially time to dust off our red lippies, and I already know this new liner from Patrick Ta is going to be a fall staple. Ta says you can layer this soft, matte liner on a bit thicker and cover more surface area than you normally would to give your look more staying power.</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288962/summer-to-fall-beauty-swaps-288962-1599091834624-image.1200x1365uc.jpg\"><figcaption>There isn't anything I love more than a popping highlight. During the summer, I go all out with it since a near-florescent jolt across my cheekbones gels super well with dewy, glossy makeup. But as the leaves change, I like to turn down the dial on my highlighter from a 10 to a nice little five. To compensate, I start adding way more shimmer onto my eyelids. It can create such a nice contrast with matte lips, or even glossy ones.</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288962/summer-to-fall-beauty-swaps-288962-1599157196324-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>If you haven't tried Rituel de Fille yet, I need you to do so right away. This witchy clean-beauty brand makes such cool products, and my favorite one is this Eye Soot. It's a tightly packed, impossibly versatile cream-powder hybrid that can be worn as a soft shimmer or built all the way up to an ultra-pigmented, almost iridescent pop.</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288962/summer-to-fall-beauty-swaps-288962-1599157201212-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>This bouncy eye shadow is perfect in every way. It might look over-the-top in the pan, but it really is one of those shadows I could tap into my lids with varying intensity on any day and for any occasion.</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288962/summer-to-fall-beauty-swaps-288962-1599095908686-main.1200x1365uc.jpg\"><figcaption>Hydration is the name of the game this season. In addition to skipping harsh cleansers that strip too many natural oils out of my skin, I'll be slathering on more overnight hydrating masks to cocoon my skin in nourishing and reparative ingredients while I sleep.</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288962/summer-to-fall-beauty-swaps-288962-1599114411535-main.800x0uc.jpg\"><figcaption>This luxe mask comes with a high price tag, but its combination of saffron flowers, shea butter, and thyme honey infuses so much moisture into the skin. </figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288962/summer-to-fall-beauty-swaps-288962-1599157290209-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>I'm still a huge fan of this OG Summer Fridays mask. I used it the other night and was instantly reminded of how lovely it is. If you want to feed your face the skincare equivalent of a gourmet meal, then heed these instructions: Spritz your face with your favorite nourishing essence, pat in three or four drops of your favorite face oil, and top the whole mixture off with the Jet Lag Mask. Thank me later.</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288962/summer-to-fall-beauty-swaps-288962-1599096020752-main.1200x1365uc.jpg\"><figcaption>Okay so, I'm not doing away with all my skincare picks tailored to achieving my baby-smooth skin goals. But as the season turns and moisture in the air begins to drop, I'm hyper-focused on keeping inflammation caused by severe dryness at bay. After all, inflammation on the face (and body) can cause a whole host of problems such as itching, swelling, breakouts, and more.</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288962/summer-to-fall-beauty-swaps-288962-1599146765007-main.800x0uc.png\"><figcaption>Astringents have no place in my routine these days. Instead, I'm reaching for this moisturizing toner from Renée Rouleau that contains hydration-boosting ingredients like omega-3, 6, and 9 and niacinamide to improve skin-barrier function and hold moisture inside.</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288962/summer-to-fall-beauty-swaps-288962-1599159632982-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>This gadget isn't an ingredient, but I have to mention it because it's one of the best skincare purchases I've made in the last few years. I know that fall brings on a desire to warm up, but this soothing facial massager brings on an epic big chill that helps to calm the skin immediately.</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288962/summer-to-fall-beauty-swaps-288962-1599091841281-image.1200x1365uc.jpg\"><figcaption>Over-exfoliation is certainly a concern once dry-skin season creeps in, but that doesn't mean I'll be shying away from the full-body exfoliators that keep my skin smooth, glowy, and primed to absorb all my favorite moisturizers.</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288962/summer-to-fall-beauty-swaps-288962-1599150750480-main.800x0uc.jpg\"><figcaption>This tingly scrub brings in both physical and chemical exfoliation with pumice scrubbers and glycolic, lactic, and salicylic acids. It's pH optimized, meaning it won't disrupt the skin's delicate microbiome. It also infuses marula oil into the skin for lasting moisture.</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288962/summer-to-fall-beauty-swaps-288962-1599151649841-main.800x0uc.jpg\"><figcaption>Super hard isn't a term I'm typically drawn to when it comes to skincare, but in this case, it works. This no-frills nylon towel allows you to carry out spa-level skin exfoliation using just your favorite oil or hydrating bodywash and a bit of elbow grease. When I tell you my skin feels like a straight-up seal after every use, I mean that.</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288962/summer-to-fall-beauty-swaps-288962-1599092701356-image.1200x1365uc.jpg\"><figcaption>Capturing the aroma of spooky season always involves a dismissal of the light, fruity notes of summer and the embrace of sensual, spicy smells that mingle so beautifully with the crisp fall air. Fragrance inhabits a top spot on my beauty checklist these days, so I'm putting a lot of emphasis on transitioning my scent wardrobe to meet the mood of the new season.</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288962/summer-to-fall-beauty-swaps-288962-1599154864359-main.800x0uc.jpg\"><figcaption>This scent is just perfect. It smells nostalgic and familiar but also super chic and unique. I love how the spicy black pepper in the top notes mixes with the warm, creamy base. It's sultry and complex and earns me tons of compliments.</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288962/summer-to-fall-beauty-swaps-288962-1599157438216-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>I'll be switching up the fragrance story throughout my entire home this season, too. Everyone talks about pumpkin- or cinnamon-scented candles as soon as fall hits, but can I tempt you with this heavenly offering from Diptyque that smells just like a crackling fireplace, instead? It's woody and not spicy, but it totally evokes the moody, cozy theme of the chillier days ahead.

At the start of each new season, I keep a running tab of all the pieces I want to add to my wardrobe to nail each of the overarching trends I'm seeing.</p><p>On my list of trendy clothes for fall 2020 are items such as chunky loafers, reworked knits, and bootcut jeans (just to name a few) that represent each of the larger trends I want to test out myself. By keeping a list like this, I'm able to avoid making impulsive purchases and ensure that each item I add to my virtual shopping cart is one that I'll be satisfied with in several months' time.</p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/282336/trendy-clothes-for-fall-editor-282336-1598994404673-main.1128x2000uc.jpg\"><figcaption>These have been sitting in my cart ever

But among them <em>are</em> some well-known faces such as jury president Cate Blanchett, Tilda Swinton, and model Taylor Hill. </p><p>Scrolling through the red carpet photos from the festival is a reminder that the COVID-19 pandemic certainly hasn't gone anywhere, as masks are required except when attendees are being photographed (but luckily, the red carpet is huge and outdoors). Perhaps the potential success of this festival is an indicator of how future similar events (i.e. awards shows and movie premieres) will go, but in the meantime, this is the only red carpet eye candy we have at the moment, and it doesn't disappoint.</p><p>Keep scrolling to see the best looks from the 2020 Venice Film Festival, and be sure to check back as we'll be adding more through September 12 when the festival concludes.</p><p><em>Opening image: Daniele Venturelli/WireImage</em></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288970/venice-film-festival-red-carpet-2020-288970-1599172891508-image.850x1275uc.jpg\"><figcaption>On Cate Blanchett: Alexander McQueen jacket, top, and trousers;

Finally, I decided to seek help <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/podiatrist-approved-house-shoes\" target=\"_blank\">by way of a podiatrist</a>, Joseph Alencherry, DPM, and what I learned from that visit has not only enlightened the way I view footwear but also subsequently caused these shooting pains to dissipate. Yes, there's a happy ending here.</p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/266099/undefined-266099-1536270359866-image.0x800uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p>By the time I got to Alencherry’s office, I already knew we’d be talking about the elephant in the room: bunions. I did <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/kate-moss-ballet-flats\" target=\"_blank\">ballet</a> for over 15 years, so I have small(ish) bunions. If you don’t know what these are, you’re one of the lucky ones. As explained on Alencherry’s website, bunions are “an enlargement on the big toe … and misalignment of the joint at that location.” What happens, the site goes on to explain, is that the deformity reshapes the big toe inward, causing inflammation and—bluntly—pain.</p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/266099/undefined-266099-1536270361462-image.0x800uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p>Inflammation and pain… sounds about right. They're not caused strictly by ballet, of course. The <strong>major causes of bunions are genetics, r</strong><strong>heumatoid arthritis, and </strong><strong>i</strong><strong>mproperly fitting shoes.</strong></p><p>That last one is typically what people like myself associate with bunions. <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/best-pumps\" target=\"_blank\">Wear high heels </a>too often? Bunions. Wear pointe shoes for an excess of years? Bunions. Well, it turns out there’s a surprising twist to this story…</p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/266099/undefined-266099-1536270364250-image.0x800uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p>When I arrived at my appointment, he did, in fact, call me out on said bunions, but his follow-up shocked me a bit. In fact, I may or may not have expected a high-five when he asked me what shoes I wore and I quickly and confidently proclaimed that I don’t really wear heels anymore. Instead, he stopped me and explained that heels aren’t the only shoe culprits behind foot pain, pointed to my sneakers (a pair of Supergas), and said that even low-to-the-ground shoes—sneakers or flats—can create legitimate foot pain if they push your toes together. <em>Say what?</em></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/266099/undefined-266099-1536270365314-image.0x800uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p class=\"p1\">Sure, I knew that wearing heels causes your toes to slide forward and squish together. But the notion that even <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/emily-ratajkowski-sneakers\" target=\"_blank\">a pair of sneakers</a> could be unsafe was mindblowing to me. After some X-rays, my rejecting a cortisone shot because I hate needles, and a painful walk back to the office, I got to thinking about my shoe closet.</p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/266099/undefined-266099-1536270365699-image.0x800uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p>What I found was an assortment of shoes meant for people with narrow feet. Sneakers, loafers,<a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/section/ankle-boots\" target=\"_blank\"> ankle boots</a>, a few high heels I refuse to part ways with—all, for the most part, narrow. Now knowing that I had to make a change and that surgery wasn’t going to be it, I started investing in and wearing footwear that offers different widths, and it reversed my pain.</p><p><figure><img

fun and not to be avoided, but wear any one style in moderation, and make sure you have a handful of pairs that let your toes spread out and chill out.</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Any

will capture the attention of all of us non-supermodels out there. Shayk is originally from Russia, but is now an <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/fashion-trends-nyc-girls-hate\" target=\"_blank\">NYC girl</a> through and through, and is regularly photographed taking to the streets in chic designer looks.</p><p>Speaking of capturing our attention, this week, Shayk wore a <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/bra-tops\" target=\"_blank\">controversial</a> look that she pulled off with ease, and it certainly speaks to the transition to fall. While she skipped the pants that you'll probably want to wear when it actually cools down, Shayk paired an oversized sweatshirt with snakeskin knee boots, and that's about it. She clearly looked amazing in the bold look, but if it's a little <em>too</em> bold for you, a similar effect could be had by adding a pair of bike shorts.</p><p>Keep scrolling to see the outfit in

Refreshingly, Meyers is all about <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/clean-beauty-products-for-mature-skin\" target=\"_blank\">embracing the aging process</a> and empowering women to be the best version of themselves—whether that's taking the leap and experimenting with <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/hair-products-for-women-over-50\" target=\"_blank\">clean beauty products</a>, <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/best-nontoxic-self-tanners\" target=\"_blank\">embracing self-tanners</a> (instead of the sun), or just knowing the best and most effective makeup hacks. </p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/287346/how-to-look-photogenic-in-your-50s-287346-1589998670792-main.1200x1365uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p>Being the font of knowledge that she is and in light of the COVID-19 outbreak, we reached out to Meyers for her best makeup and skin tips—quarantine edition. Now that everyone is under strict stay-at-home orders and taking video calls at all hours is the new normal, we asked Meyers to share her best skincare and makeup tips. In other words, what can we do to look as photogenic and bright-eyed as possible? Keep scrolling for 10 beauty tricks Meyers always abides by before jumping in front of her screen.</p><p>Yes, that's plural! According to Meyers, one of her best-kept secrets for looking refreshed and keeping her skin plump and hydrated is prepping her skin pre-camera with a face mask catered to her main skin concerns and using a separate masking formula to address the delicate eye area. </p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/287346/how-to-look-photogenic-in-your-50s-287346-1589998678239-main.1200x1365uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/287346/how-to-look-photogenic-in-your-50s-287346-1589998804093-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>\"This certified-organic treatment mask uses rose-hip seeds and quartz to polish and refine the skin,\" she explains to me, noting it's a great way to prep the complexion before tackling a day filled with Zoom calls.</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/287346/how-to-look-photogenic-in-your-50s-287346-1589998681324-main.1200x1365uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/287346/how-to-look-photogenic-in-your-50s-287346-1589998800391-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>\"These award-winning eye masks are a quick, easy fix for de-puffing and reducing dark under-eye circles,\" says Meyers. \"I pop them on for 15 minutes in the morning to help brighten my eyes for the day.\"</figcaption></figure></p><p>Even though video calls aren't the highest-quality (aka you probably can't see every line and pore as you would IRL), the goal is still to have radiant and dewy skin with coverage that mimics the health of your natural skin. The best way to accomplish this? Seasoning your canvas with a luxe oil to aid in hydration. To boost your glow even further, Meyers likes to work the oil into her complexion using a rose quartz gua sha tool. </p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/287346/how-to-look-photogenic-in-your-50s-287346-1589998690053-main.1200x1365uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/287346/how-to-look-photogenic-in-your-50s-287346-1589998793558-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>\"Hydrating and anti-aging, this natural, collagen-boosting face oil creates a perfect canvas to prime skin for that no-makeup makeup look,\" says Meyers who co-created this specific formula with Olie. </figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/287346/how-to-look-photogenic-in-your-50s-287346-1589998696310-main.1200x1365uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/287346/how-to-look-photogenic-in-your-50s-287346-1589998790022-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>\"This must-have tool from Miranda Kerr’s clean beauty line helps massage any face oil into the skin while getting out all the TMJ kinks—it's a daily ritual that keeps me glowing,\" Meyers swears. </figcaption></figure></p><p>Yep—your skin can still reap damage from the sun or from the blue light emitted from your laptop and phone. Meyers tells me she likes to multitask with coverage and SPF protection by opting for lightweight BB creams or tinted moisturizers that soften and diffuse the look of her skin for video calls while staving off any potentially damaging light. </p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/287346/how-to-look-photogenic-in-your-50s-287346-1589998785995-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>\"This unique formula is my go-to for tinted coverage and sun protection—it’s so lightweight and leaves skin with a velvety texture,\" shares Meyers.</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/287346/how-to-look-photogenic-in-your-50s-287346-1589998780856-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>She's also a huge fan of Ilia's latest skin wonder, a weightless, light-coverage tinted serum containing hyaluronic acid and SPF. \"This new multitasker leaves skin with a dewy finish and comes in 18 shades,\" she praises.</figcaption></figure></p><p>Meyers tells me she loves to play up her eyes when she's preparing for a full day of video calls or photos. Her secret? Creamy, bronze-hued eye shadow and some concealer for a dose of strategic camouflage. She also recommends sticking with clean formulas, which can be less irritating to the sensitive eye area discouraging any pesky redness. </p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/287346/how-to-look-photogenic-in-your-50s-287346-1589998777730-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>\"I love how this shade of bronze helps eyes pop on the Zoom screen and also nurtures the sensitive skin around the eyes,\" says Meyers.</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/287346/how-to-look-photogenic-in-your-50s-287346-1589998773102-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>If your goal is to look more bright-eyed (especially for those early morning video calls), Meyers says this is the perfect opportunity to add a light, hydrating concealer to your get-ready mix. Simply tap a bit of the formula wherever you have shadows and circles, and then dab and blend it out to diffuse so you don't end up with buildup or annoying creasing. </figcaption></figure></p><p>Sure, pretty much any mascara will draw attention to your eyes and enhance your lash line, but for those looking to beef up your natural lashes (which thin as we age), Meyers recommends choosing a clean formula that's enhanced with growth- and thickness-boosting conditioners and ingredients. Not only will your lashes receive instant gratification, but they may get stronger and healthier over time as well. </p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/287346/how-to-look-photogenic-in-your-50s-287346-1589998761056-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>\"This conditioning mascara has the perfect applicator—the formula nourishes lashes and gives them lots of thickness and length,\" shares Meyers.</figcaption></figure></p><p>Makeup artists always wax poetic about the importance of maintaining, shaping, and caring for your brows. (Like our lashes, brows can thin and lose their shade and luster as we get older.) Luckily, that's nothing a great eyebrow pencil can't handle.</p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/287346/how-to-look-photogenic-in-your-50s-287346-1589998754885-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>\"This universal-colored pencil beautifully blends eyebrow hair so that they look thicker and darker,\" Meyers tells me. </figcaption></figure></p><p>Adding a pop of creamy color to your cheeks can make all the difference when it comes to looking well-rested, youthful, and vibrant. In fact, you'll want to go a little more heavy-handed with your application than you would for face-to-face encounters since the color translates less intensely over your video calls. (Same goes for your mascara application!) </p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/287346/how-to-look-photogenic-in-your-50s-287346-1589998748846-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>\"Dab this organic blush on the apples of your cheeks to stay looking vibrant and rosy even after hours and hours of video calls,\" suggests Meyers.</figcaption></figure></p><p>By now we all know that sitting out in the sun (especially sans SPF) is one of the worst things you can do for your skin as we get older. If you are going to be outside for hours, please douse yourself in sunscreen to keep skin damage at bay. Or do like Meyers and feign the look of a sun-kissed glow with a nontoxic bronzer instead. </p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/287346/how-to-look-photogenic-in-your-50s-287346-1589998745447-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>\"This perfect bronzing powder creates the illusion of sun-kissed skin to look refreshed and healthy when your face is front and center on the screen,\" Meyers shares.</figcaption></figure></p><p>Youthful skin is often attributed to bright and radiant skin, but that's just not always attainable—even for those of us in our 20s or 30s! Therefore, wrinkle-, line-, and spot-diffusing highlighters can be a game-changing addition to your routine, and they can add a touch of warmth and luminosity to your complexion. Just make sure you don't choose a formula that's too glittery or disco ball–esque in its finish. This can actually draw more attention to fines lines, texture issues, and the like.</p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/287346/how-to-look-photogenic-in-your-50s-287346-1589998709023-main.1200x1365uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/287346/how-to-look-photogenic-in-your-50s-287346-1589998740226-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>A best seller, this hydrating and calming luminizer is one of Meyers's favorites. She says it helps soften and brighten the skin to give her complexion a bit of shimmery highlight that translates beautifully on-screen.</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/287346/how-to-look-photogenic-in-your-50s-287346-1589998737528-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>\"This is a multipurpose polish delivering luminous warmth for eyes, cheeks, and face,\" says Meyers. \"The bronze-gold color, especially, looks gorgeous on all skin tones.\"</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/287346/how-to-look-photogenic-in-your-50s-287346-1589998733347-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>Last but not least, this natural highlighter comes in a stick form and delivers light-reflecting radiance to highlight your favorite features. \"I keep it in my desk drawer and swipe it on my cheekbones right before Zooming,\" adds Meyers.</figcaption></figure></p><p>Lips (like our hands, necks, even our brows) are one of the features that can easily be forgotten but can be a dead giveaway for your age. Not that that's a bad thing, but keeping your pout plump, shiny, and hydrated acts as a filter of sorts for lines, wrinkles, and loss of volume, which can all intensify as we get older. </p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/287346/how-to-look-photogenic-in-your-50s-287346-1589998718181-main.1200x1365uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/287346/how-to-look-photogenic-in-your-50s-287346-1589998728616-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>Meyers is a fan of this silky, CBD-spiked gloss that feels soothing on the lips and comes in a variety of photogenic shades.

but… I can count on my hands how many times I've put on makeup since shelter-in-place orders started in March. In the pre-pandemic world, I had a very subtle makeup vibe anyway: A dab of concealer under my eyes, a stroke of mascara on my lashes, and a swipe of moisturizing lip balm, and I'd be set for the day. So it's not like I've been skipping out on a major look for myself, but that hasn't stopped me from wishing I'd just done those little extra steps whenever I preview my face before logging onto a Zoom meeting. It doesn't seem like that's ever going to happen, though, so I'm looking to alternatives for getting my signature no-makeup-makeup look, without the makeup altogether.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/ext?tl=NngR6iG0OE5B4d9nxiJ-4bBiVQXTEngnZocKruY0kUL6WvDAvA\" target=\"_blank\">Vegamour</a>'s plant-based line of hair-growth products for lashes, brows, and hair is exactly what I was hoping for. Unlike my makeup regimen, my skincare routine has, if anything, improved since going into lockdown, so applying a serum to my lashes, brows, and scalp after showering is as effortless as any rote habit. The brand uses fair-trade and hormone-free bio-active phytomolecules to open more hair follicles on the scalp and for longer periods of time, thus restoring and promoting more visible hair growth. In just four months of continued use, you'll see more hair density, volume, and length. Vegamour also promises reduced shedding and zero negative side effects. So whether you're looking for a way to simplify achieving a no-makeup look or giving more body to your head of hair, you'll want to check out Vegamour's line of hair growth products.</p><section

And while many of us spent the '90s and early 2000s doing everything in our power to make our eyebrows as thin as humanly possible, the trend has definitely shifted in favor of fuller, <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/how-to-get-shape-eyebrows/\" target=\"_blank\">more prominent brows</a>.

But all brows are not created equal. According to celebrity brow artists <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/ext?tl=KbpVh3C-89RMswcOJwpAfan8LJ56p_GGdBD9V236Wew6ZqtphmxSn5hxP1-aeA\" target=\"_blank\">Damone Roberts</a> and <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/ext?tl=RxKK426_ZcL8UF5SNyRJg4KoUKr2Qf5V_jp7mKaZFjyD9L9Jwwg_0vyUu50X\" target=\"_blank\">Kelley Baker</a>, whose client rosters boast celebs from Oprah to the Kardashians, there's much to consider.

But I do caution against going overboard, which tends to make one appear stern and angry,\" says Roberts, who's responsible for Oprah's perfectly round-face-complementing arches.  Celebs with this face shape: Oprah, Chrissy Teigen, Selena Gomez</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/282686/best-eyebrows-for-face-shape-282686-1570492513475-image.1200x1754uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/282686/best-eyebrows-for-face-shape-282686-1570492514025-image.1200x1754uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/282686/best-eyebrows-for-face-shape-282686-1570492639815-main.1200x1754uc.jpg\"><figcaption>Longer, rectangular faces are best complemented with straighter brows, according to our experts. \"As soon as brows start to look too angled, they age people. So I always like a softer shape to keep a more youthful look in the face,\" says Baker.  Roberts agrees, adding that \"full brows leaning more toward the straighter side look beautiful.\"  Celebs with this face shape: Tracee Ellis Ross, Sarah Jessica Parker, Joan Smalls</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/282686/best-eyebrows-for-face-shape-282686-1570492515036-image.1200x1754uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/282686/best-eyebrows-for-face-shape-282686-1570492515724-image.1200x1754uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/282686/best-eyebrows-for-face-shape-282686-1570492669458-main.1200x1754uc.jpg\"><figcaption>Since oval-shaped faces have some similar qualities to both long and round faces, our pros advise going for a subtle shape that adds to the depth without adding more length.\"Obviously, if your face is round, we don't want to give you round brows, because then there's no dimension,\" says Baker. \"We want a defined brow with a subtle arch. Just not too extreme,\" adds Roberts. Celebs with your face shape: Beyoncé, Alexa Chung, Jessica Alba </figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/282686/best-eyebrows-for-face-shape-282686-1570492516625-image.1200x1754uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/282686/best-eyebrows-for-face-shape-282686-1570492517275-image.1200x1754uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/282686/best-eyebrows-for-face-shape-282686-1570492716265-main.1200x1754uc.jpg\"><figcaption>For those with heart-shaped faces, the goal is to shorten the face a bit while also creating a brow that's large enough to fill out the ample forehead real estate available. \"A heart-shaped face should have the least of an arch, as you don't want to add more length. Keep it on the straighter side, which shortens the face,\" Roberts explains. Celebs with this face shape: Kourtney Kardashian,Kerry Washington, Reese Witherspoon </figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/282686/best-eyebrows-for-face-shape-282686-1570492518952-image.1200x1754uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/282686/best-eyebrows-for-face-shape-282686-1570492519755-image.1200x1754uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/282686/best-eyebrows-for-face-shape-282686-1570492744797-main.1200x1754uc.jpg\"><figcaption>Diamond-shaped faces have a bit more freedom when it comes to selecting a brow shape. Since the forehead tends to be smaller and the face tends to be longer, you might think thin, straight brows would be the only way to go. But since the shape can take on so many different looks depending on fullness, there's a lot of room to play. Roberts just has one pro tip: \"Not too defined, with a nice arch.\"  Celebs with your face shape: Jennifer Lopez, Rihanna, Halle Berry</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/282686/best-eyebrows-for-face-shape-282686-1570492520304-image.1200x1754uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/282686/best-eyebrows-for-face-shape-282686-1570492518287-image.1200x1754uc.jpg\"><figcaption>Up next, this is how to grow thicker eyebrows.

Expensive","link":"http://feeds.whowhatwear.com/~r/WhoWhatWear/~3/tarcLpBV-oI/bows-fashion-trend","description":"<p>Maybe it’s just me, but I happen to think that you can throw a black bow on pretty much any article of clothing and it will look instantly elevated. From tops and sweaters to casual dresses and evening gowns, there’s something about the little—<em>or big, depending on the case</em>—detail that just feels fancy. That’s why I was quite pleased this past February when I noticed countless bows in velvet, satin, and grosgrain going down the runways of so many of our favorite brands and on a range of pieces. A memory I recently revisited while doing another <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/fall-trend-shopping-guide-2020\" target=\"_blank\">deep dive into F/W 20 trends</a> last month.  </p><p>What’s especially great about this one in particular, however, is that while it does look and certainly can be expensive, it can also cost you as little as $3, as long as you’re not opposed to an easy DIY. All you need to do is buy the ribbon or pre-tied bows—<a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/ext?tl=9S3byQQS2riOT_G3zoPp04XSELBl9_KVdfI_SFH0VFaGZ-3xce27ZEnNYj6BaaAGt3Q5oxhavjkmaaVJedxsBytMHDGfxmW0P2cR-YbMsURg_9TekJ7jg8F8NOztNcXCto0PbqR-qkIJ0U80CNcPxqNoM-U0-dgfhTt2b099LgosItCTeoLUSGJeLv-LZaIVzMuonaSrZ-XUsyVTEp82va1TC5gfo6mcHhU\">Amazon is a gold mine of them</a>—and sew or simply pin them to any piece you already own. Voila! An instant upgrade awaits.

It's easy to see why the Stockholm-based brand is so popular; in addition to the incredibly chic and minimal packaging, the unisex scents are as unique as they come yet undoubtedly wearable and intriguing as well. Trust me—everyone will ask you what <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/top-perfumes-for-women\" target=\"_blank\">scent</a> you're wearing when you spray on Byredo, and anything you buy from the brand is worthy of the price tag, but I'm here to help you narrow it down (there are so many good ones to choose from).</p><p>For my own <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/fall-perfumes\" target=\"_blank\">fragrance</a>-buying mission and for <em>your</em> fragrance-buying missions (I'm here to serve), I asked Byredo to send me samples of their best-selling scents, and they kindly obliged. Over the past few weeks, I've been switching up my scent on a daily basis, because variety is the spice of life, and I wanted to give you my honest reviews of the 10 most popular Byredo perfumes.</p><p>There are plenty of fragrance reviews out there, but I find them to be quite technical, speaking to all of the different layered notes in a scent. My reviews are more about how they'll make you feel when wearing them, the best occasions and seasons to wear them for, how versatile they are, etc. Keep scrolling if you're intrigued and be sure to head all the way to the bottom for what I think is the best Byredo fragrance.</p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/284172/byredo-perfume-284172-1591304512833-main.1080x1349uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p>Oud Immortel is a beautiful scent, and I was excited to get to try it, but for me, it was just a bit masculine. It was created around a certain type of dark wood that's used in traditional incense, so it's as smoky and complex as you'd imagine. While it may not be right for me, I'd buy a bottle for my husband in a second.</p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/284172/byredo-perfume-284172-1591305965272-main.800x0uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/284172/byredo-perfume-284172-1591304577651-main.1080x1349uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p>Mojave Ghost is one of Byredo's buzziest scents, so I was eager to try it. I do see why this one is so popular—it's a lovely option for evening but isn't sweet or overly floral in the least. It's soft and the floral aspect is soft and more woodsy, with a hint of sandalwood and amber. The only reason I don't think I'd adopt it is my signature scent is that it develops a bit of a powdery note on me as the day wears on, but some people may embrace that.</p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/284172/byredo-perfume-284172-1575487845048-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/284172/byredo-perfume-284172-1591304545045-main.1080x1350uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p>Byredo's Bibliothèque candles have an intense cult following (I'm a member of that cult), so it was wise of the brand to create a perfume. I honestly couldn't describe this scent to you if I tried, it's so unique. There is a rich patchouli note that is overarching though, so if you like expensive-smelling patchouli, you'll love this. Again, this one was a wee bit too masculine for me (but my love for the candle lives on), and I'd 100% buy it for my husband and require that he wear it every day.</p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/284172/byredo-perfume-284172-1575488316568-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/284172/byredo-perfume-284172-1591305274007-main.1080x1266uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p>Flowerhead is definitely the most floral scent in the bunch, and would make the perfect daytime scent in spring and summer. As is the norm for Byredo, it's a very complex floral that feels exotic and fresh. It certainly has signature scent potential but not really year-round.</p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/284172/byredo-perfume-284172-1591305977629-main.800x0uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/284172/byredo-perfume-284172-1591304920814-main.1080x1350uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p>Slow Dance is one of Byredo's newer fragrances; it launched just in time for fall. I'd seen it all over several cool girls' Instagrams, so I, too, had to try it. Like Bibliothèque, this one is also a bit tricky to describe. It definitely feels like a rich, cold-weather fragrance to me, and patchouli and vanilla are the base notes, but they're the most sophisticated versions of patchouli and vanilla you can imagine. If you like your scent to be warm and slightly sweet, this one's for you.</p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/284172/byredo-perfume-284172-1575491346991-main.1034x1033uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/284172/byredo-perfume-284172-1591304966949-main.1080x1350uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p>The first of the two rose fragrances (more to come on the other soon), Rose Noir is a bit earthier of the two. Byredo describes it as \"dirty\", and I'd have to agree. It has some depth to it but is undeniably a rose lover's dream.</p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/284172/byredo-perfume-284172-1591305987091-main.800x0uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/284172/byredo-perfume-284172-1591304156198-main.1080x1080uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p>I apparently live on the edge because I bought Velvet Haze without even smelling it a few months ago (the brand had me with the \"coconut water\" description). Luckily, I loved it. I prefer it for evening, as it's a bit musky, but it's also a great anytime scent during fall and winter. When I first sprayed it on, I was struck by the smell of patchouli but it softens beautifully. Highly recommend.</p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/284172/byredo-perfume-284172-1575491400547-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/284172/byredo-perfume-284172-1591305029987-main.1080x1350uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p>Bal d'Afrique is another one of the brand's cult favorites that I was so intrigued by. You just feel cool and in the know when wearing it. If I'm putting it simply, the incense is a notable layer, but very expensive and rare incense that you can only get in Africa.</p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/284172/byredo-perfume-284172-1575493091597-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/284172/byredo-perfume-284172-1591305067315-main.1080x1350uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p>I'm always on the hunt for a cool rose fragrance and I really struck gold with this popular Byredo scent. It's subtle and fresh but with a hint of richness (thanks to the white amber base note). This is one of those rare scents that I'd be happy to wear every day, year-round. I'm probably going to have to add it to my collection.</p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/284172/byredo-perfume-284172-1575493669430-main.1200x1199uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/284172/byredo-perfume-284172-1591305124204-main.1080x1350uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p>We've come to the end, friends, and my number one paycheck-worthy pic is Gypsy Water. Sorry, no surprise here! It's the brand's best-selling, most well-known, and most Instagrammed (I checked) scent, and for good reason. It's the one I reached for the most these past few weeks because wearing it just makes me happy. It smells of sandalwood and vanilla, lemon and campfire, and so many other things you would never believe could smell so intoxicatingly good together. It smells so beautiful that I don't even care that it's not particularly under the radar. I want to wear it constantly so that I can smell my wrist every time I need a pick me up.</p><p><figure><img

I <em>suck</em> at <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/section/hair\" target=\"_blank\">hair</a>. French braids? Can't do them. Fishtail braids? Impossible. I can't do updos. I can't do cool vintagey styles. I can't even make a chic chignon work. I only know how to do one thing with my hair and one thing only: flat iron waves.</p><p>Call it a signature hairstyle, call it the only hairstyle I actually know how to do… However we want to frame it, <strong>my relaxed, bendy waves seem to work pretty well for me.</strong> They're effortless and versatile; they take very few materials and very little time. Sometimes I add a <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/claw-hair-clips\" target=\"_blank\">hair clip</a> or a headband, but that's about as fancy as it gets. And yet, they earn me at least one compliment per day. </p><p>Learn this absurdly simple styling technique (which I've nailed down thanks to years of advice from stylists as well as my own personal trial and error), and I hope you'll find it as useful as I have. Keep scrolling for how to create the perfect flat-iron waves in 10 minutes or less!</p><p><strong>The materials:</strong></p><p><strong>- </strong>A 1-inch thick flat iron with adjustable heat settings</p><p><strong>- </strong>A heat protectant</p><p><strong>- </strong>A hair tie</p><p><strong>- </strong>Some texture spray (optional)</p><p><strong>- </strong>A hair accessory (optional)</p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/281028/flat-iron-waves-tutorial-281028-1562023525088-product.1150x1150uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/281028/flat-iron-waves-tutorial-281028-1562023525929-product.1280x1280uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/281028/flat-iron-waves-tutorial-281028-1562023526565-product.800x0uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/281028/flat-iron-waves-tutorial-281028-1562023601954-product.0x800uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/281028/flat-iron-waves-tutorial-281028-1562095092836-product.3000x3000uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/281028/flat-iron-waves-tutorial-281028-1562095253972-main.1000x1000uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><strong>The instructions:</strong></p><p>This technique will work best on anyone with hair lengths from a chin-length bob to just past the collar bone. (I have naturally straight hair, but I know it works on wavy textures, too.) <strong>All you need to do are the following seven steps.</strong></p><p><strong>1. </strong>Plug in your flat iron and set it to no more than 310 degrees. This is to protect your hair from burning to a crisp.</p><p><strong>2. </strong>Spritz your hair protectant all throughout your hair. </p><p><strong>3. </strong>Gather all the hair above your ears into a loose half ponytail on top of your head to get it out of the way for now. Secure it up there temporarily with your hair tie.</p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/281028/flat-iron-waves-tutorial-281028-1562095494637-main.800x0uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><strong>4. </strong>When you create waves in your hair, you're going to use two alternating motions. This is what gives the final result a more natural, tousled look. For both motions, you'll take a 1-inch think section of hair and place it between the flat iron plates. The first motion goes in an M-shape: with the inch-thick section of hair between the plates, you'll guide the flat ironin toward your face, then out, then back in at the ends. The other motion is simply to twist the flat iron (with hair between the plates) away from your face and hold it in that twisted position for about five seconds. Make sure to leave the ends out of the flat iron so they stay flat. Also, be sure not to brush the wave out while it's still hot, not even with your fingers, or you'll lose the shape.</p><p>When I'm waving this bottom layer of hair below my ears, I'm not super perfectionistic about it, because no one will really to see it when the look is all done. For some strands (like the hard-to-reach ones in the back), all I do is curve the ends inward. This allows you not to heat sections of hair that don't really need it. </p><p><strong>5. </strong>Once you're finished with the bottom layer of hair, let down the top. Part it where you like. Then repeat step four, with more attention to detail this time, all around your head. For the two strands of hair directly on either side of my face, I choose to use the wave motion that goes away from my face, to create a flattering curtain effect.</p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/281028/flat-iron-waves-tutorial-281028-1562095497363-main.800x0uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/281028/flat-iron-waves-tutorial-281028-1562023366255-product.800x0uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/281028/flat-iron-waves-tutorial-281028-1562095042710-product.800x0uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/281028/flat-iron-waves-tutorial-281028-1562023365316-product.1560x1960uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/281028/flat-iron-waves-tutorial-281028-1598986381972-main.800x0uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/281028/flat-iron-waves-tutorial-281028-1598986280041-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><strong>6. </strong>For a messier bed head look, spray a dry texturizer throughout your hair. <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/ext?tl=I9tyC4FpVGmELNkLD-AmIJSUwEyvcZCsAhbWrQYJuMH-pH8kv7ULBKjhOMnlEVnULHui5QdKzXFcl461YEtihDxjCgobgm1HYtxezpY_4R9u7wqcA0f_W64rd1oUyuX1Po7FM4spksLkZbs7Q4FmstmBuouMcf_oNea1OXoyFd1X4k1Sa8PV10Ao3lshliqJPZK0XN5H9bLInhzvDZ3nyTmeJw\" target=\"_blank\">Kristen Ess</a> makes a great one that smells lovely and tousles your hair without leaving it crunchy.

words. Never have I ever (or at least not until a few weeks ago) been able to stomach a clean and/or natural foundation formula. I have painstakingly high standards when it comes to the finish, application, tone, and durability of my foundation, and nothing I ever tried felt up to snuff (or even close, for that matter). In fact, I would likely need another set of hands to count the number of times I excitedly applied a promising new and natural foundation alternative only to be instantaneously scandalized by the sticky or slippery texture, suspiciously off-base undertones, or lack of day- or night-enduring stamina. Simply put, if a foundation makes me look oily, discolored, or downright discombobulated, I will put it down and never touch it again. (The one exception has been Ilia's cult-loved <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/ext?tl=HdIsGXbL3d5agtnW5wyMoxEFIGY0Eb4HB-qvU2pQZVVFcmenmVCS_5cebX2CXY_S6JOU_jpEHDf8\" target=\"_blank\">Super Serum Skin Tint SPF 40</a>, which I'm absolutely obsessed with.)</p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288933/exa-beauty-high-fidelity-foundation-review-288933-1599166179644-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p>Believe me, I have wanted to love a clean foundation for a long, long time. I've amassed quite a few other natural makeup formulas I routinely use and recommend, but foundation is where I consistently get stuck. Even though consistency and finish have always been problematic (so many natural formulas are very oily or tacky), the lack of shades has been, and still is, completely unacceptable within the clean-beauty space. So when some of my favorite peeps over at clean-beauty retailer <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/ext?tl=ACqFjCOdxblVphn1zrVGXRM-jkZeZwnAcldOQyOcAMIrcWKSLH5PwxIpWCNDIKJVe3_l7c44Hcwe\" target=\"_blank\">Credo</a> popped into my inbox to tell me they were launching its first-ever private-label makeup brand, Exa, I was instantly intrigued. <em>I love Credo, so this one had to be a winner, right? </em></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288933/exa-beauty-high-fidelity-foundation-review-288933-1599166197363-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>Equipped with 43 shades that cater to a multitude of undertones, Exa is officially the most shade-inclusive makeup line in the clean-beauty category. But the magic doesn't end there. At $38, Exa's High Fidelity Foundation is significantly more affordable than most popular clean (and not so clean) foundations on the market, and the ingredients are impeccably dreamy and safe for all skin types. The vegan formula boasts a bouncy, satiny, featherlight consistency that's comparable to some of the most sought-after, makeup artist–approved options on the beauty market. But complexion-loving ingredients like peach extract, aloe vera, microalgae actives, maqui berry, and hyaluronic acid trick your skin into thinking you've just applied the most delicious of facial serums—not a foundation. </figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288933/exa-beauty-high-fidelity-foundation-review-288933-1599166201945-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>The foundation is buildable, imparts a luminous result, and can be paired with its strategically designed partner in crime, Exa's Jump Start Smoothing Primer ($34), to take the results even further. Of course, all of this is just fine and dandy to say and promote, but my fellow beauty editor Courtney Higgs and I were skeptical. We were eager and hopeful but were still skeptical—especially because, during a prelaunch Zoom date, celebrity makeup artist Katey Denno revealed the foundation was comparable to her non-clean favorites like Chanel and Armani. So is the new Exa High Fidelity Foundation really as table-shaking as it sounds? Courtney and I are sharing our honest ratings and reviews below. Plus, we're each rounding out our Exa reviews with a quaint list of clean-makeup products (from other brands) that never do us wrong.

Rating: 4/5 stars. Review: Little did this foundation know when it arrived on my doorstep that it would have to jump through every precarious hoop a foundation can be put through: 100-degree heat and a trying 16 hours of wear. (Yep, I did the most damning thing a beauty editor can do and slept in the stuff.) However, in an epic plot twist that I've never experienced with a clean foundation formula, it passed every test with flying colors. (For the record, nearly every other natural foundation I've tried has melted off my face three hours after application and at even the mere mention of sweat or exercise.) So yes, I'm extremely impressed with this foundation. What I love most about this foundation is how beautifully and smoothly it applies and blends into the skin. It does that \"your skin but better\" thing, which is entirely the point of foundation, right? I'm pretty sure I actually murmured aloud \"holy shit, this is beautiful\" as I used my Beautyblender to buff and press it into my skin. That type of jaw-dropping, immediate reaction rarely happens for me. It smells lovely, which is important (for me) when it comes to makeup because it's sitting right beneath your nose. While the finish is slightly more luminous and dewy than I would normally go for, I found that setting it with a touch of powder easily toned down any areas I felt looked too shiny. And again, let's remember I was battling high humidity and heat, so I'm not sure it would always end up looking quite so glowy. I ended up wearing this foundation overnight (I know, I know), and I was completely surprised when I woke up in the morning to find that it still looked *almost* as good as when I first applied it. Really. It only looked slightly worse for wear than my non-clean foundations that tout super-long, 24-hour wear. I did set it with a non-clean setting spray, which probably helped matters. I've done that before with natural foundations, and they've still looked smudgy and all-around messy a few hours afterward. This foundation doesn't apply, look, or wear off like any other clean foundation I've tried. It's far superior, and it even comes in a beautiful glass bottle that makes it feel really expensive. I'm impressed all around. The only reason I can't give it a full five stars is that the finish is a little too dewy for my taste. But all in all, Exa's High Fidelity Foundation has set a new standard in the industry for both quality and inclusivity. It's time for all of the other brands in the clean-beauty space to level up! </figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288933/exa-beauty-high-fidelity-foundation-review-288933-1599166210117-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288933/exa-beauty-high-fidelity-foundation-review-288933-1599166452496-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>I'm a ruthless mascara tester, and this is by far my favorite clean mascara. And not only that: It's one of my favorite mascaras, point blank. It's one of the few formulas that effortlessly curls, volumizes, and lengthens my long (but very straight) lashes without weighing them down or creating a gloppy and gloopy look I'm definitely trying to avoid. I recommend this mascara all the time, and I maintain a perfect zero-complaints-received track record. </figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288933/exa-beauty-high-fidelity-foundation-review-288933-1599166457363-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>Concealer is one of the most important products in my routine. I use (a lot) below my eyes, and I use it to reverse contour my face. So it's important that it blends well and looks natural but will also stay. This skincare-level formula from Kosas does all that and then some. The coverage is amazing, it barely creases (especially if you set it with a touch of powder), and it has amazing ingredients that will actually benefit your skin. </figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288933/exa-beauty-high-fidelity-foundation-review-288933-1599166462293-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>I love everything Maya Chia makes (which is mostly skincare), but this shimmering serum-highlighter hybrid is really on an entirely different level. It basically makes it look like you're standing under perfect lighting no matter where you go, and I don't know if I've ever tried a highlighter that blends and melts into my complexion so seamlessly and *actually* looks like my skin. So many highlighters set out to accomplish what this one does but ultimately fail thanks to overly sparkly formulas or consistencies that are too sticky, tacky, or slippery. </figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288933/exa-beauty-high-fidelity-foundation-review-288933-1599166469005-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>I've loved Rituel de Fille's Enchanted Lip Sheers for years. Datura, Whitethorn, and Swarm are constants in my beauty rotation. They can be a little drying, but if you apply them on top of a really hydrating balm, you should be good to go. Even though my entire makeup routine is definitely not clean, I try to make sure whatever I put on my lips is. So I'm almost always wearing one of these or something from Kosas. </figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288933/exa-beauty-high-fidelity-foundation-review-288933-1599166477854-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>I'm probably as tough on bronzers as I am on mascaras and foundations, but I finally found love and satisfaction when this buttery, super-luxurious bronzer from legendary makeup artist Gucci Westman came into my life. It's easy to blend, the color isn't too pink or too orange, and it's boosted with lots of great ingredients to keep your natural glow alive. </figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288933/exa-beauty-high-fidelity-foundation-review-288933-1599166483748-main.1200x1598uc.jpg\"><figcaption>Shade: Paetynn 170 (medium deep with golden undertones). Rating: 5/5 stars. Review: As someone with brown skin, I’m still getting used to the concept of a clean foundation. Up until about a year ago, there wasn’t a single clean foundation on the market I could point to that had the shade range to match my skin. So when Erin sent me an excited message in Slack a few weeks back about Credo’s new in-house makeup brand that was not only clean but was also coming out of the gate with 43 shades, my interest was immediately piqued. Before I go any further, I need to mention that I am mildly traumatized from having to mix foundation shades for so long, and I can acknowledge that I may get overly excited when I get my hands on a single bottle that matches me perfectly. It’s not such a rarity anymore, but a perfect shade match and clean ingredients? That’s not a product I’m used to seeing! I love this foundation. It imparts that quenched, glowy finish that’s taken over Instagram. It’s super dewy... like so dewy it can err on the side of oily if you’re not careful. After experimenting a bit with the application, I’ve learned that layering it on top of a heavy moisturizer will end in disaster (even when accompanied by the Exa Jump Start Smoothing Primer). The key, for me, has been pairing it with a lightweight moisturizer and setting any super-loose areas like my forehead, which is oilier than ever right now, with a thin layer of powder. Overall, I’m very satisfied with this foundation and can’t wait to see how it holds up during a full day of outdoor activities (whenever outside opens back up again).</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288933/exa-beauty-high-fidelity-foundation-review-288933-1599166493040-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288933/exa-beauty-high-fidelity-foundation-review-288933-1599166498971-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>I honestly can’t wear foundation without concealer. To me, it’s like eating French fries without ketchup: fine but not as satisfying as I’d like. This clean concealer is great because it’s lightweight and doesn’t overwhelm my skin. But it does tend to move around and settle into creases, so setting it is a must.</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288933/exa-beauty-high-fidelity-foundation-review-288933-1599166504189-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>Rituel de Fille is such a fun brand. I love many of its products, but at the top of the list is this cream blush. I like that the color blends down to a really soft and diffused glow that doesn’t even really look like makeup. I also like that the color doesn’t just sit on top of the skin and break up over the course of the day. You can also use it on the lips, which I love, but I recommend topping it with a little clear gloss unless you’re committing to a velvety, almost-matte stained look.</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288933/exa-beauty-high-fidelity-foundation-review-288933-1599166509488-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>There aren’t many highlighters you can wear on bare skin without looking like a misguided glitter bomb went off on you. This highlighting liquid creates a healthy vibration of super-subtle shine wherever you place it. I like to tap it into my cheeks and onto my Cupid’s bow to add extra life to my face.</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288933/exa-beauty-high-fidelity-foundation-review-288933-1599166516711-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>This product is solely responsible for my love of colorful eye shadows. I used to stick to neutrals, but this rusty-red shade has helped me create some of my favorite eye looks of all time. It can be worn super sheer to look like a rosy tint or layered to look like a full-impact coppery red. Even on days when I want to be low-key, I still find myself reaching for this pot! Top five forever.</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288933/exa-beauty-high-fidelity-foundation-review-288933-1599166523827-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>I’ve been wearing mascara since I was in middle school, but even back then when I was reaching for drugstore picks or ones with wild ingredients like glitter, I never had issues with the varnish irritating my eyes. Recently, I’ve been noticing certain mascaras make my eyes sting after a few hours of wear, so I've been leaning into the clean options on my vanity more. This one from Westman Atelier is just perfect. It volumizes and defines my lashes really well. The packaging is also pure luxury.

Popular","link":"http://feeds.whowhatwear.com/~r/WhoWhatWear/~3/V9xrSgcs8K8/popular-swimsuit-trend","description":"<p>I don't know about you, but I'm a sucker for a swimsuit that's really dang pretty. In my experience, nothing garners compliments and \"where did you get that?\" inquiries quicker than a <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/pretty-swimsuits\" target=\"_blank\">pretty swimsuit</a>. The trend that <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/fashionable-clothing-basics\" target=\"_blank\">generates the most compliments</a> this summer also happens to be spiking in popularity. According to a recent <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/ext?tl=turyazCC7KDXEGEUJCpAukumWu8ojZaYdCL9CR_t2B2naP4p-_cInGgvt6dxQWPTHO5FKuPljAQ268_q_u0m2QmBPNfT1ufEaA\" target=\"_blank\">Pinterest report</a> on the most-shopped swimsuits, <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/how-to-wear-leopard-print\" target=\"_blank\">leopard print</a> has increased in popularity by a whopping 445% over last year, thanks mostly to a $25 H&M version. (Don't worry. You can shop a similar style further down.)</p><p>I'm definitely not a numbers-oriented person, but that strikes me as a pretty significant jump in interest from shoppers. Since animal print of all kinds is a huge trend this summer (both on and off the beach), it makes sense why this would translate to some of the summer's prettiest bikinis and one-pieces. I have definitely contributed to the leopard swimsuit's popular reputation, as just last week I found myself going out of my way to compliment a woman I spotted wearing the eye-catching print on the beach. It's just that good!</p><p>Ahead, see just how cool the swim trend looks on fashion girls, and pick out a leopard bikini or one-piece to wear on your next beach day.</p><p><figure><img

Offset with feminine elements like a neat cardigan or a little ladylike bag for an unexpected interpretation of the look,\" she said. </p><p class=\"m_8242331729177948089p1\">This baggier denim trend gives hints to that skater-girl vibe when paired with Vans and oversize striped tees, but as Seidel said, when juxtaposed with a tiny bag, kitten heels, and maybe even some pearls, this casual denim trend can instantly read elegant and forward. But don't be mistaken—this look is taken straight from the late '90s skater kids we all secretly wanted to be, but the style is officially back and it's better. Based on the versatile styling ideas alone, skater jeans seem to be a great denim choice for the season ahead. Throw in the fact that looser clothing, in general, has officially begun to suit our more casual lifestyles due to the pandemic and you've got yourself a must-have new denim trend to try this fall. </p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288963/skater-jeans-trend-288963-1599166512369-main.1200x1598uc.jpg\"><figcaption>This fall, a pair of skater jeans and a neutral coat could easily become your new favorite outfit formula.

you go, and faithfully protect your belongings. But how are you taking care of them? When your favorite clutches and satchels are off duty, it’s essential to have a storage plan for your most beloved bags. There are a variety of ways to store purses, and the best solutions tend to vary by type of bag, as well as how much storage space you have. But whatever your scenario, there’s definitely a better option than shoving your latest purchase into a corner to collect dust. Read on for a few of our favorite tips on how to store purses safely and stylishly.</figcaption></figure></p><p><span>This is a good option for closets with a shelf directly above your clothes. Section off as much space as you need, and then place bags upright, side-by-side, and vertically so that they’re easy to see and grab. One of the best perks about this method for purse storage is that you can see them right next to your wardrobe, making accessorizing easier than ever. For bonus points, consider arranging your bags by color, size, or type.</span></p><p><span>Hooks are ideal for varied purse collections or for the girl who has one of everything. Hooks can typically be easily installed either inside or outside the closet. This method is great if you’re looking to save space. As a tip, consider length when you’re buying hooks (longer hooks will be able to store more purses), and keep in mind that wider is better. Razor-thin hooks can create dents and creases in shoulder straps.</span></p><p><span>A creative solution for purse storage is to stash them in a magazine rack. These can vary by size, from small-scale desktop organizers to full-on columns or space-saving versions that can be attached to the back of a door. This method isn’t optimal for totes or satchels, but it is ideal for organizing your collection of clutches and envelope-style handbags.</span></p><p><span>One of the most universal approaches to storing purses is the use of boxes or bins. When done poorly, this method can be chaotic, but when done right, it can keep handbags beautifully organized and in top condition. If you decide to go this route, there are a few key tips to keep in mind. </span></p><p><span>First, make sure to choose the right size of boxes or bins. Measure your closet and your largest handbag, and take the area you intend to store them into account.</span></p><p><span>Next, make sure you’ve allotted enough <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/closet-organization-amazon\" target=\"_blank\">storage space</a> so that the items don’t get squished or misshapen. For vintage, delicate, and high-end luxury handbags that you don’t use often, consider bins or boxes that completely seal and offer the best protection.</span></p><p><strong><span>Now that you know

2020","link":"http://feeds.whowhatwear.com/~r/WhoWhatWear/~3/i-r7myYRfJs/flare-jeans-trend","description":"<p>If I opened your denim drawer right now, I bet I could guess some of the key silhouettes stored inside—straight-leg jeans, <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/outfits-with-skinny-jeans\" target=\"_blank\">skinnies</a>, and perhaps even an of-the-moment outlier like those <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/grandpa-jeans-trend\" target=\"_blank\">“grandpa” cuts</a>. But what’s one style that probably hasn’t surfaced to the top of the pile as much as of late? Flares. Sure, cropped flares have been well, cropping up, over the last few years, but the more polarizing bootcut and bell-bottom styles (aka anti–skinny jeans) haven't been as popular again <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/bootcut-jeans-trend\" target=\"_blank\">until recently</a>. Well, get ready—as we continue to see on the runway and streets, flares are officially back and will continue to hold strong through 2020.</p><p>That’s right, designers from Celine to Paco Rabanne reintroduced fresh flared jeans in their S/S 20 collections as the next It denim pick for the forward set. And fun fact, celebrities like Gigi Hadid, Margot Robbie, and Harry Styles have already been following suit in ’70s-inspired flares. Fashion girls are also starting to embrace the vibe.</p><p>To highlight the look further, we broke down how the flare trend is taking over the runway, celeb, and It-girl world for you below. We also shopped out the coolest cuts of the moment if you’re ready to try the trend again—before everyone else does come 2020.</p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/283331/flare-jeans-trend-283331-1572023377274-image.1200x1767uc.jpg\"><figcaption>Light-wash flares pop even more with black separates like with this cropped black knit.

That said, one way to protect shoes is to waterproof them. Fortunately, this lesser-known but useful wardrobe hack is simpler than it sounds. To help you get started, we’ve rounded up eight of the best waterproof sprays for shoes that really work.</p><p>Some of the best waterproof sprays for shoes are made by Kiwi.

While some handbags have been </span><a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/most-popular-designer-handbags\"><span>popular for a long time</span></a><span>, it is only within the past few years that the mini-bag trend has risen in prominence. This is due in part to Instagram-favorite designers like Jacquemus, helping to usher the trend into viral territory. And while my mini-bag ramblings have yet to dissipate, I must admit that I’m relieved to see a new, more practical purse is on the horizon. This season, please welcome the clutch bag. </span></p><p>Clutch bags first emerged in the 1920s to address the needs of consumers who, in lieu of a more practical, traditional carryall, were craving small, stylish bags that would compliment specific looks. It’s true that like mini bags, clutches can be a fussier choice; since by definition, these bags require some sort of hand-holding. But that doesn’t mean they’re not practical—some of the best clutch bags actually can hold more than a Tic-Tac, cost less than a fortune, and dare I say, give pockets a run for their money. Don’t believe me? Ahead, I’ve rounded up the 35 best clutch bags in every shape, and at every price point.</p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288967/best-clutch-bags-288967-1599095301440-main.850x1275uc.jpg\"><figcaption>Bottega Veneta ushered in the popular cloud-shaped clutch back in July of 2018; and two years later, it’s clear that this bag and its various iterations are here to stay. </figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288967/best-clutch-bags-288967-1599095327642-main.850x967uc.jpg\"><figcaption>Not able to yet invest in Bottega Veneta’s cloud clutch?

it would be—and that’s the simplest and nicest way for me to put it. Among many things in life, my hair routine has been disrupted. No salon treatments, no feeling like I'm in a hair campaign thanks to a fresh blowout. Even though salons are starting to open across the country, who knows when things will be back to how they once were, so I decided to take matters into my own hands. </p><p>My good friend and co-worker Natalia Sztyk has been raving about the <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/ext?tl=EfqDssoTJ5bztq56XimdQ-deBtCfxmystaAlsmjy4cAkgS7y379MqkCOkTa62_eotGDCvw\" target=\"_blank\">Dyson Airwrap™ styler</a> the tool that lets you curl, wave, smooth, and dry hair all at once with no extreme heat—all thanks to the Coanda effect, which attracts and wraps hair to the barrel using only air. Honestly I was surprised to hear she was using (and loving) it, since the last I heard she'd given up hot tools. Here’s a little backstory: A few years ago, Natalia dyed her hair ombré, and as much as she said she loved how it looked, the chemicals seriously damaged her locks. So last year, she decided to get her hair healthy again by taking it back to her natural black color and committing to air drying. When recently, Natalia felt ready to invest in a product that would help reduce hair breakage and damage, it only made sense to go with a hair tool from the experts in hair health—Dyson. Dyson has a team of experts that study in detail everything from thermal, mechanical, and chemical hair damage to airflow dynamics. “Before I felt like I had no option other than letting my hair air dry, but the Dyson Airwrap is a way to create hairstyles without extreme heat,” she tells me. “There are also so many different styling attachments [six to be exact], so you can create so many hairstyles and never get bored.” </p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288725/fall-hairstyle-inspiration-288725-1598048678406-main.1139x2232uc.gif\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p>She had my attention, but a $550 price tag isn't a buy-on-a-whim situation. I really needed to be sure it's worth the investment. So, I did what I always do when I'm thinking about a big purchase: calculate what the cost per use would be over the course of a year and it's impressive. (Take a look for yourself above—even if I'm using it just once a month, it's more affordable than getting a blow-dry.) Natalia took it one step further by sending me pictures of all the salon-worthy hairstyles she created last week and the Dyson styling attachments she used for each. I'm sold and assume you will be, too, after you take a scroll…</p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288725/fall-hairstyle-inspiration-288725-1598050709168-main.1260x1600uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p>I know Natalia is my friend and all, but how cute does she look? It's crazy how some hair volume and bounce can make a casual jeans-and-tee outfit look way more fun.</p><p><strong>Get the look—soft waves:</strong> Natalia used the pre-styling dryer attachment, then the firm smoothing brush at her roots, and finished with the 1.2-inch barrel to curl her hair away from her face. \"I brushed the curls out with my fingers for a more undone feel,\" says Natalia. </p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288725/fall-hairstyle-inspiration-288725-1598050714448-main.1260x1600uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p>Simple yet sophisticated and so easy, Natalia tells me. \"I love that I was able to go from damp hair to smooth and straight so easily without extreme heat.\"</p><p><strong>Get the look—smooth & straight:</strong> Natalia used the firm smoothing brush styling attachment from root to tip and repeated until all her hair was done. \"It helps to section your hair, and focus on the bottom part before moving to the top,\" explains Natalia. </p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288725/fall-hairstyle-inspiration-288725-1598050720051-main.1260x1600uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p>I've known Natalia for years now, and I'm telling you she used to <em>always</em> wear her hair with beachy waves. So, I'm calling it: Now this is going to be her regular style again.</p><p><strong>Get the look—beachy waves: </strong>After using the pre-styling dryer attachment, use the 1.2-inch barrel styling attachment with the arrows pointing away from your face. \"I alternated the way each section was curled by changing the barrel directions because it made the style feel more relaxed and beachy,\" explains Natalia. </p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288725/fall-hairstyle-inspiration-288725-1598050725793-main.1260x1600uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p>If you don't live in Los Angeles, then you might not know we've been experiencing quite a heatwave. It only makes sense Natalia styled a 'do that was completely out of her face for a particularly warm day. It's definitely a nice way to spice up a regular ole ponytail.</p><p><strong>Get the look—pony up:</strong> Natalia says she used the pre-styling dryer attachment and then both the 1.2-inch barrel and 1.6-inch barrel styling attachments to curl her hair before pulling it all back into a ponytail. Super easy and effective.</p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288725/fall-hairstyle-inspiration-288725-1598050731373-main.1260x1600uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p>Okay, it legit looks like Natalia got her hair professionally blown out. This is the style that has 100% convinced me I need a Dyson Airwrap of my own.</p><p><strong>Get the look—full-bodied volume:</strong> Natalia says she used the pre-styling dryer attachment and then the round volumizing brush styling attachment. \"For this look it's important to get volume at the root, so lift hair at the crown, shaping and lifting side sections up and outwards.\"</p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288725/fall-hairstyle-inspiration-288725-1599090506882-main.1260x1600uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p>To me, this looks like it must have taken forever to do, but Natalia assured me it was actually super quick and easy. \"It reminds me of my wedding hair, so I felt super confident and happy all day long,\" she tells me.</p><p><strong>Get the look—Hollywood waves: </strong>Natalia used the pre-styling dryer attachment and the 1.6-inch barrel styling attachment curling toward her face. \"For a more voluminous feel, brush the curls out after,\" she says.</p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288725/fall-hairstyle-inspiration-288725-1599090493174-main.1260x1600uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p>I love this final 'do. It looks like a combination of a few of the earlier ones: not as glam as Saturday's style but not as casual as Wednesday's. It's the perfect middle ground.</p><p><strong>Get the Look—tousled texture: </strong>Natalia used the pre-styling dryer attachment and the 1.6-inch barrel styling attachment, alternating the barrel directions for a more undone, tousled look. \"Don't forget to run your fingers through the curls to loosen them up,\" she says.</p><p>I don't know about you, but Natalia has totally sold me on the Dyson Airwrap. Sure, the price is an investment, but considering there are six styling attachments, the options for hairstyles feel endless. It's the versatility that's got me!

tenets of timeless fashion and tweaking them for changing weather.</p><p>And for those of you who live in California or another region where temperatures tend to stay pretty consistent year-round, consider this an all-season guide. Below, see 11 outfit ideas to try now, and shop cropped denim and pretty tops to wear now and layer later.</p><p><figure><img

like the feeling of slipping on a <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/best-sweatshirt-brands\" target=\"_blank\">sweatshirt</a>. Even in the middle of summer, I crave it. The soft fleece material and slouchy fit can't really be compared to any other clothing item, which explains its enduring popularity. And I have a hunch that since comfort is everything this year, they're going to be even more popular than ever come fall, which I'm already seeing some proof of.</p><p>If you're like me, you've been diligently checking the new arrivals sections of a variety of e-tailers, and have likely noticed a plethora of new sweatshirts. But I found something a bit different while scrolling through H&M and Zara, in particular: <em>Fancy</em> sweatshirts are the style that's going to be everywhere this fall and winter. If you think about it, fancy sweatshirts are the perfect clothing item for fall 2020, as we all want to feel cute without sacrificing comfort, whether staying in or going out for socially distant

href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/author/judith-jones\" target=\"_blank\">my articles</a> regularly, you'll know I'm a bit of a sucker for shopping on <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/best-fall-sweaters-on-amazon\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a>. (It's really hard to resist two-day shipping!) I tend to buy a lot of my fashion <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/affordable-fall-basics\" target=\"_blank\">basics</a> from the multi-brand retailer—(not to mention books, electronics, home goods, baby gear) and plenty of other random but surprisingly useful items.</p><p class=\"p1\">So today, I've decided to share a few of my favorite <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/the-best-amazon-fashion\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a> purchases I've made in the last six months that I use and wear <em>all the time</em>. Whether it's my basic black <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/cheap-summer-dresses-on-amazon/slide8\" target=\"_blank\">tank dress</a> I throw on when I want to feel comfortable yet put-together or my tan slide sandals that go with literally everything in my closet or my trusty basket bag that exudes French-girl style, read on if you want a little inspiration for your next Amazon purchase.</p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288898/cute-and-cheap-amazon-items-288898-1598905810229-main.3024x4032uc.jpg\"><figcaption>I use this Moroccan basket bag nearly every day. It's ideal for farmers market runs to days at the beach to brunch and everything in between. It exudes that effortless French-girl vibe. I like this one, in particular, as it's not overly large so it can act more like a handbag. </figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288898/cute-and-cheap-amazon-items-288898-1598905798795-main.1500x1500uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288898/cute-and-cheap-amazon-items-288898-1598901705262-main.2877x4032uc.jpg\"><figcaption>I've been living in this crazy-soft tank dress lately. It's not only super comfortable (easy to work and run around in all day) but the silhouette also makes me feel put-together and polished. It's easy to wear with sneakers and sandals and boots come fall.</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288898/cute-and-cheap-amazon-items-288898-1598902191360-main.800x0uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288898/cute-and-cheap-amazon-items-288898-1598902279213-main.1080x1349uc.jpg\"><figcaption>I love a casual button-down shirt—especially one that's slightly oversize. This one from Amazon brand, Goodthreads is my new favorite. The blue hue feels fresh and the quality is really nice.</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288898/cute-and-cheap-amazon-items-288898-1598903228486-main.800x0uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288898/cute-and-cheap-amazon-items-288898-1598903318141-main.1080x1350uc.jpg\"><figcaption>I have really discovered the joy of a glasses chain. Not only does it look snazzy (leaning into the grandma-trend), but it really is also helpful when you're on the move and want to have your glasses or sunglasses close by (without having to rummage in your purse for them or have them slip off your head). I like this delicate pearl-and-metallic one, as it works well with everything I wear. </figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288898/cute-and-cheap-amazon-items-288898-1598904246060-main.1001x1001uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288898/cute-and-cheap-amazon-items-288898-1598906669975-main.3024x4032uc.jpg\"><figcaption>I love these sandals with a capital L! They not only look chic (total Hermès vibes going on here), but the sole is also squishy and super comfortable. I could walk in them all day with no complaints. Plus, the tan color is so versatile.</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288898/cute-and-cheap-amazon-items-288898-1598906860707-main.800x0uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288898/cute-and-cheap-amazon-items-288898-1598907180677-main.3024x4032uc.jpg\"><figcaption>While it's still warm out, I highly recommend this versatile romper.

I own a lot of white T-shirts and this is still one of my favorites for its easy style, silhouette, and fit. There is no trace of your bra showing underneath (hallelujah!), and the quality is surprisingly good for the price. It remains a Who What Wear best seller and is a favorite among our editors.</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288898/cute-and-cheap-amazon-items-288898-1598907936157-main.1154x1500uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288898/cute-and-cheap-amazon-items-288898-1598908594135-main.2316x3088uc.jpg\"><figcaption>A little hair accessory action never goes amiss in my book, and of my go-to's are these adorable long silk ribbon bow hair ties.

I first saw this loose and cool dress on fashion influencer Jacey Duprie and was eager to try it for myself. It's flowy, non-restrictive, and easy to dress up and down with the right accessories and shoes. It fits quite loose, so I do recommend sizing down.</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288898/cute-and-cheap-amazon-items-288898-1598909065535-main.800x0uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288898/cute-and-cheap-amazon-items-288898-1598909145047-main.1080x1350uc.jpg\"><figcaption>I'm not going to lie, I think I wear these black Champion shorts more than any other item in my closet since quarantine began back in March.

I love this one as it's subtle yet still makes a statement. Sometimes it's the little things that can take your outfit to the next level.</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288898/cute-and-cheap-amazon-items-288898-1598910701043-main.2937x4032uc.jpg\"><figcaption>If you're looking for a cozy and comfy pair of sweatpants to swan around in at home, this $8 pair from Hanes might be up your alley.

Ideal to transition you into fall.</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img

Gerber might whip out some low-rise <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/kaia-gerber-flare-leggings/\" target=\"_blank\">brocade flare leggings</a> like it ain't no thing, but Crawford is much more likely to rely on her vast denim collection.</p><p>Naturally, Crawford has a pair of jeans for every scenario: skinnies for tucking into boots, straight-leg jeans to team with blazers, stretchy jeans for laidback outfits, and wide-leg jeans to wear with, well, whatever she feels like. I combed through tons of photos to find the jeans she appears to wear the most frequently, so scroll down to shop like the supermodel.</p><p><figure><img

First things first, it's pretty and comes in a lot of colors. I am a fashion editor after all, so this is an important consideration! But more seriously, it's made of silk, which is a smart move for a number of reasons. The fabric is known to possess antimicrobial and antibacterial properties, and silk is also much comfier than other materials and slides across the skin, making it less likely to irritate your skin. And just like silk pillowcases are great for not soaking up all your creams and serums, the nonabsorbent nature of the material helps keep skin hydrated and lets all that lovely skincare stay on your skin. (Picture rubbing a cotton swatch vs a silk swatch over your face and you can imagine the difference in how much more drying the cotton would be.) Now let's talk about the disposable filter: it's made from melt blown. If that term is new to you, like it was to me, let me explain. The material is used in surgical <span class=\"il\">masks</span> because it has smaller \"pores\" meaning it can better block particles in the air. Why does it have smaller \"pores\"? Because unlike woven fabrics like cotton, which naturally have more space between the fibers because they are woven together, melt blown is, \"mechanically, thermally, or chemically bound from separate fibers of molten polymers.\" Science. Also, the ear straps are adjustable so you can get the perfect fit for your face. And last, but not least, there is a charitable component. For every <span class=\"il\">mask</span> sold, they will donate five to frontline workers. That's all I've got, and after writing this, I've basically convinced myself to buy another. Let's match?\" —Kat Collings, editor in chief</p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288905/best-face-masks-from-editors-288905-1599012929667-main.1000x1000uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288905/best-face-masks-from-editors-288905-1598903584015-main.1000x1000uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288905/best-face-masks-from-editors-288905-1598902891179-main.800x0uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p>\"While at first, I was only wearing simple black <span class=\"il\">masks</span>, and the typical filter ones I figured it was time to start getting creative with them as we're going to be wearing them until COVID-19 is under-control, and why not make a cute statement while protecting others?

NPD Group found that sports bra sales increased by 6% over the past year, and millennials, in particular, spent a third of their bra budgets on this one style last year.</p><p>Marshal Cohen, chief industry analyst at the NPD Group, attributed the rise in popularity of sports bras to athleisure and the desire for comfort in fashion. In addition to that, <em>WWD</em> points out that people's \"increasingly busy lives\" are at play, as well as the \"innerwear-as-outerwear trend.\" So if it seems like popular brands like Lululemon and Marks & Spencer are offering more sports bras than ever, you're not imagining it, and there's clearly a lot of data behind it.</p><p>Scroll on for some of the chicest sports bra examples on

href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/best-anti-aging-face-oils\" target=\"_blank\">face oil</a> is one of the most controversial skincare products on the beauty market. Walk (or scroll) through any beauty retailer, and you'll find hundreds of options featuring all sorts of oils, <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/types-of-skin-acids\" target=\"_blank\">actives</a>, and other credit card–tempting ingredients. Some people swear by its efficacy for hydrating and healing <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/best-body-oils\" target=\"_blank\">thirsty skin</a> while others condemn face oil with fearmongering threats of congestion, clogged pores, breakouts, and more. So what are we to believe?</p><p>I'll admit that for years I wouldn't touch face oil with a 10-foot pole. I have sensitive, acne-prone skin, and I was as terrified of face oil as I am of spiders, heights, losing A.C. in 100-degree heat… You get the idea. But then, the tide started to change. I began talking to more and more dermatologists and facialists who told me face oil is largely misunderstood. In fact, pretty much every person with any type of skin can benefit from it. That said, there are some important caveats and things to know when shopping for the best face oil for your unique complexion. As with all skincare, face oils are not one size fits all, and there is some strategy and skill involved in choosing the right one.</p><p>To clear the muddled air surrounding face oils, and in order to gather more intel and advice on whether they're the worthwhile investment the industry wants us to think they are, I reached out to two amazing experts: <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/ext?tl=ehAvl2839JjNaonlUn1ydk1-MflxP6SRjYUIVU5IuAE76xkujruUaoc8jNe0EyBUdcWlOcJe\" target=\"_blank\">Sunday Riley</a>, master formulator, CEO, and founder of her namesake skincare brand, and board-certified dermatologist <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/ext?tl=0xZdou6TDH60yRUWlFFbRz_SVdqAIkGRIyDE-BJPcJTaxO1ls4TJbIwekNzv6X6_QlI0kg\" target=\"_blank\">Shari Sperling</a>, DO. Keep scrolling for everything you ever wanted to know about face oil and to shop some of the best options for every skin type. </p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288993/best-face-oils-288993-1599241035503-main.1200x1598uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p>Yes, yes they are. That said, there is one *very important* caveat to this, which is the quality and formulation of the face oil you use. For instance, the oils hanging out in your kitchen cupboards or bodycare collection are (or should be) vastly different from what you're putting on your face.</p><p>\"Face oils are specifically formulated to sink in and moisturize without leaving an oily finish,\" says Riley. \"You might also find they have oil-soluble esters in them, which reduce the greasiness of the other oils and leave a very velvety, dry finish on the skin. Face oils are also one of my favorite ways to get oil-soluble actives, like retinoids, salicylic acid, or vitamin C esters, into the skin.\"</p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288993/best-face-oils-288993-1599241042917-main.1200x1598uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p>According to both Riley and Sperling, everyone can, indeed, use and reap the moisturizing benefits of face oils. But again, it comes down to using your oil correctly and choosing a formula catered toward your skin type or your major concerns. For example, someone with very dry skin probably won't use the same oil as someone with very oily skin. And yes, even folks with oily skin can use face oil. The right mixture of ingredients can actually help stabilize and regulate the skin's sebum production, which, in turn, will help <em>curb</em> excessive oiliness.</p><p>\"Remember, applying a face oil should not make you produce more oil—quite the opposite,\" Riley confirms. \"If you have oily skin, look for an oil with oil-soluble esters, which help the oil to sink into the skin and disappear.\"</p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288993/best-face-oils-288993-1599241056463-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p>Yes and no. High-quality, strategically formulated face oils should not clog your pores, but not every oil is suitable for your face or every skin type. Steer clear of highly comedogenic oils (like coconut oil), and mind how <em>much</em> oil you're applying. A little goes a long way.</p><p>If you're especially prone to grease or are worried about congestion and breakouts, however, Riley suggests looking for a face oil that contains an ingredient like salicylic acid that will dissolve the sticky, oily buildup loitering around your pores. (Sunday Riley's <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/ext?tl=SUCYUm29gQdOd25ufNM2QFtFP9zOcmTu3zEHR7fvbokY7qzlNR_fqGdbt485F2J9ZNdHqWDt4bJC\" target=\"_blank\">U.F.O. Ultra-Clarifying Acne Treatment Face Oil</a>, $80, is a great option.)</p><p>Of course, if you were to slather your body oil onto your face, it very well may result in clogged pores or a fresh set of blemishes. According to Riley, these types of products usually feature heavier oils that can be too much for the complexion to handle, ultimately trapping bacteria and leading to unwanted congestion. </p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288993/best-face-oils-288993-1599241082192-main.1200x1598uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p>As a rule, your face oil should pretty much always be the very last step in your routine since oils have a larger molecular size. If you apply it too early, anything you put on afterward won't be able to penetrate the skin. </p><p>\"An oil with active ingredients in it (like retinoids, vitamin C esters, or salicylic acid) is more like an oil <em>serum</em>, whereas a pure oil with ingredients like argan oil or jojoba oil is really just a nurturing moisturizer,\" explains Riley. \"I like to apply oil serums first after cleansing and/or toning so that the retinoids or vitamin C can easily sink into the skin. But if you're using a straight oil like jojoba, make sure to apply it as your last step. It's too heavy to go first and could stop your other products, like serums, moisturizers, and treatments, from effectively penetrating into your skin.\"</p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288993/best-face-oils-288993-1599241131253-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>Tea tree oil, salicylic acid, and black cumin seed oil work together to combat breakout-causing bacteria. Then, additional strategic ingredients like hexylresorcinol and licorice help gently brighten the skin to even out lingering scars or pigmentation.</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288993/best-face-oils-288993-1599241114238-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>If you're looking for one of the best oils to help keep breakouts at bay, Sperling recommends reaching for a formula featuring rose hip.

The superstar ingredients include grape-seed, lavender, clove, juniper berry, tea tree, and clary sage oils. </figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288993/best-face-oils-288993-1599241247524-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>Featherlight and natural, this is one of the best (and most affordable) oils for any skin type, but especially peeps with combination skin. Its hero ingredient is plant-derived squalane, which delivers potent hydration to thirsty skin while simultaneously curbing oil production that's in overdrive.

target=\"_blank\">Claire Most</a> is one of our favorite French women to follow on Instagram. One scroll through her feed and you'll see why, but just to reiterate, she has a cool and casual style that it's impossible to not want to emulate, she's constantly introducing us to <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/emerging-fashion-designers\" target=\"_blank\">new and under-the-radar brands</a>, and don't even get us started on her gorgeous hair and makeup looks.</p><p>Most is originally from Paris but moved to Portland, Oregan last year. And while she certainly seems to have adapted to the West Coast lifestyle, she's stayed true to her French-girl roots, regularly mixing classic pieces (like straight-leg jeans, white tank tops, and trenches) with more directional ones and pretty pieces with streetwear. (Oh, and we'd be remiss to not mention her epic sneaker collection). </p><p>Since summer is drawing to a close and we all have fall on the brains, we obviously want to know what stylish women (i.e., Claire Most) have on their shopping lists. She obliged and shared with us a variety of fittingly cool pieces that will make anyone wish for fall to hurry up and get here. Keep scrolling to see what she's shopping for this season and get a glimpse of her cool French-West Coast style.</p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288965/french-fall-style-288965-1599078109606-image.1200x1598uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288965/french-fall-style-288965-1599078145837-product.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>\"I am definitely obsessed with this piece.

Down","link":"http://feeds.whowhatwear.com/~r/WhoWhatWear/~3/S2oSWMORPtU/best-musk-perfumes","description":"<p>In case you haven't been following, I've recently started moonlighting as a beauty writer in addition to my day job as the managing editor of Who What Wear's sister site, <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/\" target=\"_blank\">THE/THIRTY</a>. As someone who was always interested in beauty and skincare but never really covered it in my 10-year journalism career, it's been an eye-opening experience. I've learned <em>so much</em>, including what exactly is <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/hyaluronic-acid-benefits\" target=\"_blank\">hyaluronic acid,</a> everything I've ever wanted to know about <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/best-body-sunscreens\" target=\"_blank\">sunscreen</a>, and the best way to <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/best-face-exfoliators\" target=\"_blank\">exfoliate my skin</a>. My brain has gotten heavier (in the best way possible) with knowledge, and my skin has never looked better.</p><p>One of the beauty topics I've enjoyed learning more about has been fragrances. I never really gave much thought to it mostly because I don't have a great sense of smell due to an accident a few years ago. (That's a story for another time.) So I didn't know that there is so much to perfumes and scents from all the layers of notes to chemistry to fragrance families. I recently talked to some perfumers about <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/\" target=\"_blank\">how to purchase a fragrance online</a>, and it was one of the most interesting subjects to write about and consider, especially since most of our shopping is being done online at the moment.</p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288936/best-musk-perfumes-288936-1599012302067-main.960x1281uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p>Writing about the topic has really made me rethink my perfume choices. I always stood firmly in the <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/best-gardenia-perfumes\" target=\"_blank\">florals camp</a>, but now I'm looking to new horizons—mainly the musky scents of the world. I always thought the woodsy, earthy, grounding scent was a little <em>too</em> heavy and not really the vibe I was trying to give off. I've always gravitated toward light, natural, fresh, and sweet-but-not-too-sweet scents.</p><p>While I still love those notes, I'm ready to get a little more mysterious and serious with my fragrances. Maybe it's because I'm getting older and am solidly in my 30s now, or maybe it's wanting to shake things up when we're finally able to get out there and see our friends and family safely again. Whatever it is, I'm ready for a rebranding of sorts when it comes to my perfumes. And I think musky scents are a great place to start because they still have a natural vibe but with a little bit more sophistication and intrigue.</p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288936/best-musk-perfumes-288936-1599012382978-main.1010x1347uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p>In my quest to find a musky perfume to call my signature scent, I've made a wish list. Take a look at what I'm eyeing below. Maybe you'll be inspired to try them, too.</p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288936/best-musk-perfumes-288936-1599014872835-main.2723x3096uc.jpg\"><figcaption>I'm intrigued by the coconut water in this Byredo fragrance.

This fragrance from Tom Ford is warm and spicy with notes of saffron, thyme, maté, suede (of course), olibanum, and musk. I'm putting this on my list of perfumes to wear on a night out.</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288936/best-musk-perfumes-288936-1599015458001-main.1821x2071uc.jpg\"><figcaption>A blend of florals, amber, and creamy musk, this fragrance is equal parts feminine, warm, and cozy.

Glossier's You perfume uses that type of chemistry to adapt to the specific user. It has base notes of musk, ambrette, and ambrox and has top notes of green irisroot and pink pepper.</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288936/best-musk-perfumes-288936-1599016031941-main.4920x5595uc.jpg\"><figcaption>Chanel's Chance may seem like an ordinary floral perfume at first, but the jasmine is balanced with vanilla, pink pepper, amber patchouli, and white musk.</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288936/best-musk-perfumes-288936-1599012517290-main.1012x1350uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288936/best-musk-perfumes-288936-1599016232228-main.2000x2637uc.jpg\"><figcaption>The Nubian Musk perfume is described as \"capturing the healing power of plants,\" so it has fresh scents of rose, jasmine, and Moroccan grapefruit.

href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/best-face-masks\" target=\"_blank\">Face masks</a> are one of those pesky categories of skincare that practically <em>beg</em> us to pull out our credit cards and start swiping with zero abandon. Not only does packaging seem to get prettier and prettier (conveniently in tandem with our bank accounts getting tinier and tinier), but the benefits, technology, and overall allure of face masks are also increasing at a rapid rate. Ingredients are getting more exotic, and suddenly, the tempting nature of additions like crushed diamonds, 24-karat gold, exfoliating acids, superfoods—heck, even things like adaptogens and <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/cbd-beauty-products\" target=\"_blank\">CBD</a>—make forking over $50, $100, or even $200-plus seem like the norm. But of course, it doesn't <em>have</em> to be.</p><p>Sure, there are plenty heart-stoppingly expensive face masks we love and salivate over, but the quality of drugstore beauty offerings has also reached a steep incline in the past few years. For $25 and under, you can still satisfy your craving for lust-worthy ingredients like volcanic crystals, lavender oils, and manuka honey but at a fraction of the cost.</p><p>We're big fans of customizing your skincare routine so you're getting the best, most bang-for-your-buck results regarding your skin concerns, and we're here to tell you that there are some best-selling, high-quality drugstore formulas that we recommend (and use!) as beauty editors and that have the sky-scraping reviews to back them up.

I used this salicylic- and charcoal-infused formula before I was a beauty editor, and I plan on using it until the day Yes To stops making it, which I hope is never.  Rating on Ulta: 4.3 stars and 134 reviews</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/279791/best-drugstore-face-masks-279791-1557531581974-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>SheaMoisture sometimes flies under the radar, but the brand makes some of the friendliest formulas for our faces and bank accounts. This strategic blend utilizes African black soap and calming raw shea butter to simultaneously rebalance, detoxify, and soothe blemish-prone skin.  Rating on Target: 4.4 stars and 2149 reviews </figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/279791/best-drugstore-face-masks-279791-1557531590636-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>Spiked with skin-refining ingredients like strawberry and rosemary, this drugstore face mask from Formula 10.0.6 is designed to de-stress clogged pores so you reap an instantaneous and gratifying glow. Plus, it will set you back less than a daily coffee habit (at least by L.A. standards). Rating on Ulta: 4.2 stars and 774 reviews</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/279791/best-drugstore-face-masks-279791-1557531602914-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>This clarifying clay mask is one of those underground dark horses that pretty much every beauty editor and celebrity has hiding somewhere in their stash of skin-saving products. It's one of those formulas you reach for when you simply need something that works—fast. It's made from 100% natural bentonite clay and essentially slurps every last inch of crud from your pores. That said, it can be mildly irritating (again, this is the no-BS antidote!), so don't leave it on longer than five to 10 minutes, and a bit of redness is to be expected.  Rating on Amazon: 4.5 stars and 13,826 reviews</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/279791/best-drugstore-face-masks-279791-1585947411638-main.1080x1350uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/279791/best-drugstore-face-masks-279791-1557531621154-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>Honey is known as one of Mother Nature's skin-friendliest ingredients, especially for those seeking a hard hit of hydration. Paired with delicate lavender oil, reviewers say this drugstore face mask imparts skin-refreshing moisture while still being gentle. In other words, this is a great option if you're on the more sensitive side of the skin spectrum! Rating on Ulta: 4.4 stars and 88 reviews</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/279791/best-drugstore-face-masks-279791-1557531631665-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>Pacifica has a wide offering of really nice skin-saving masks that honestly feel about 10 times more expensive than their actual price, but this formula, in particular, is one of its best sellers. Especially great for parched skin, it's a creamy, overnight formula, which means you'll wake up with a rejuvenated, ultra-dewy complexion thanks to a jam-packed roster of antioxidants, extracts, and essential lipids.  Rating on Ulta: 4.7 stars and 417 reviews</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/279791/best-drugstore-face-masks-279791-1581371205367-main.800x0uc.jpg\"><figcaption>We're big fans of multitasking facial products, and this mask-scrub hybrid satisfies the craving easily at just $10. It's made with 99% naturally derived ingredients; it's vegan and cruelty-free; and thanks to skin-improving ingredients like apricot seed, it leaves dull dehydrated skin with an immediately noticeable glow. Rating on Amazon: 4 stars and 44 reviews </figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/279791/best-drugstore-face-masks-279791-1557531651683-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>Nope, that's not a typo. This hydration-boosting sheet mask is actually $4. But wait: It gets better. The noncomedogenic formula (so yes, it plays well with blemish-prone skin, too!) features hyaluronic acid and improves the skin's moisture levels thanks to the 100% hydrogel material, which holds the power of a bottle's worth of serum per mask.  Rating on Ulta: 4.4 stars and 583 reviews</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/279791/best-drugstore-face-masks-279791-1585947478235-main.1080x1080uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/279791/best-drugstore-face-masks-279791-1557531668056-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>For those suffering from dull and drab skin, this diamond-infused peel-off mask will be your vanity's new MVP. Simply leave it on for 20 minutes, and let the epic combination of pearl powder (exfoliation!), diamond powder (radiance!), rice bran extract (vitamins!), and oat (antioxidants!) do its thing.  Rating on Ulta: 4.4 stars and 756 reviews</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/279791/best-drugstore-face-masks-279791-1557531675192-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>This drugstore face mask consistently gets some of the highest reviews and praise across all of our favorite retailers. It's meant to detoxify and brighten, utilizing three different kinds of clay plus charcoal to purify skin to glowing perfection.  Rating on Amazon: 4.5 stars and 2268 reviews</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/279791/best-drugstore-face-masks-279791-1557531682836-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>To get glowing skin fast, this best-of-the-best drugstore mask comes in clutch. It helps boost radiance in just five minutes and also helps ramp up exfoliation so your complexion will look and feel smoother and more even in the long run, too. Its hero ingredients include AHA acids from blueberry, sugar cane, maple sugar, orange, and lemon; and volcanic rocks and mineralizing thermal water help clear and rebalance pores with protection and moisture.  Rating on Amazon: 4.4 stars and 134 reviews</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/279791/best-drugstore-face-masks-279791-1557531691648-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>Exfoliation is the most important thing when it comes to transforming dull, glowless skin, and this drugstore-priced mask is a top seller at Ulta for that reason precisely. One part scrub, one part mask, it features activated charcoal to suck out excess oil and impurities (without removing essential hydration) while black sugar gently removes dead skin cells that hinder your chances for radiant skin.  Rating on Ulta: 4.4 stars and 1257 reviews</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/279791/best-drugstore-face-masks-279791-1585947550753-main.1080x1350uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/279791/best-drugstore-face-masks-279791-1557531697066-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>My mom—who's 71—swears by No7's variety of anti-aging serums and masks, and this sheet mask, in particular, gets a lot of love from satisfied reviewers. For an on-the-fly pick-me-up, this lifting and luminosity-enhancing sheet mask boasts seven days worth of age-defying serum ingredients, but you only have to keep it on your face for 20 minutes. It includes the brand's most effective anti-wrinkle peptide technology—think Matrixyl 3000, hyaluronic acid, hibiscus, and vitamin C—for an affordable skin glow.  Rating on Walgreens: 4.5 stars and 179 reviews</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/279791/best-drugstore-face-masks-279791-1557531707085-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>While it might be on the spendier side for a drugstore face mask, this intense formula from L'Oréal is well worth the extra investment. Luxurious and hydrating, it boasts a unique Elasti-flex texture, which virtually mimics the skin's natural elasticity and is the first nighttime treatment to combine Pro-Xylane (a concentrated super ingredient) with botanical extract Centella asiatica. It helps to re-firm and tighten facial contours while also diminishing fine lines and wrinkles.  Rating on Amazon: 4.5 stars and 599 reviews</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/279791/best-drugstore-face-masks-279791-1557531719107-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>For those who don't like sheet masks and don't like the inevitable drippage and mess of creams and gels, this peel-off mask is a game changer. It does pretty much everything under the sun to give your complexion some TLC, including but not limited to flooding the skin with protective and preventative antioxidants, gentle exfoliation (thanks AHAs!), and reparative vitamin E. Rating on Amazon: 4.3 stars and 37 reviews</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/279791/best-drugstore-face-masks-279791-1557531726702-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>Ample hydration is essential if you're looking to slow down the visible aging process and stave off fine lines, wrinkles, dullness, among other concerns. This overnight moisturizing pick from Burt's Bees, however, can take care of that! It's one of our forever-favorite drugstore beauty brands, and we love that this hearty mask is filled to the gills with skin-loving ingredients like avocado oil, prebiotics, and other superfruits rich in healthy fatty acids.  Rating on Amazon: 4.5 stars and 276 reviews.

20s","link":"http://feeds.whowhatwear.com/~r/WhoWhatWear/~3/GtB70x1hsgI/fall-shopping-in-your-20s","description":"<p><figure><img

I forget what I even wore <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/fast-fashion-brands-for-your-30s\" target=\"_blank\">in my 20s</a>. (Given that I spent several minutes the other day trying to remember if I'm 35 or 36 (it's 36), it's certainly possible.) But just as important as remembering what I did wear is what I <em>didn't</em> wear. For much of my 20s, I spent my clothing budget on trendy, inexpensive items that I'd quickly tire of. There are certainly exceptions but for the most part, I wasn't particularly worried about <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/best-fashion-investment-buys\" target=\"_blank\">longevity</a> when I'd decide what to buy. I've spent the first half of <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/clothing-brands-in-your-30s\" target=\"_blank\">my 30s</a> making smarter wardrobe investments that I wish I'd started making earlier on. </p><p>Since fall is on the horizon, I've been thinking lately about the types of pieces I wear the most this season, year after year, and they're not the same trendy accessories, going-out tops, and dresses (to name a few) I was wearing 10 years ago. This is partly because my style has changed since my 20s and partly because I wasn't making that many lasting purchases. My budget was certainly more limited then, as is the case with many 20-somethings, but I regret not living by the 'ole less is more/quality over quantity adage a little more. </p><p>With that, keep scrolling to shop the nine wardrobe investments I wish I'd made in my 20s, that work for every age group.</p><p>I'm someone who's always on the hunt for the next denim trend, which is all well and good, but the jeans I wear the most are those that can't be classified as a trend. They have a straight leg, a high waist, and a medium wash, and no other defining qualities, and that's what I love about them.</p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288930/fall-shopping-in-your-20s-288930-1598986590314-product.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288930/fall-shopping-in-your-20s-288930-1598986584733-product.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288930/fall-shopping-in-your-20s-288930-1598986583201-product.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p>Coats can be pricey, so I tend to wear the same ones for several years in a row at least, which is why I think outerwear is a very worthy investment. You can really tell the difference between a cheap and a high-quality wool coat, for example, so this is an area that's worth more of a splurge.</p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288930/fall-shopping-in-your-20s-288930-1598986575394-product.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288930/fall-shopping-in-your-20s-288930-1598986581307-product.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288930/fall-shopping-in-your-20s-288930-1598986579199-product.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p>While this is certainly more of a year-round investment than a specific fall one, when summer ends, I always want to put on more nice jewelry. And unlike when I was in my 20s, there are so many good DTC fine jewelry brands on the market now, so high-quality pieces are more affordable than ever. I can say with confidence that I wear very few of the costume jewelry pieces I bought in my 20s, if any.</p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288930/fall-shopping-in-your-20s-288930-1598986577025-product.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288930/fall-shopping-in-your-20s-288930-1598986585287-product.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288930/fall-shopping-in-your-20s-288930-1598986582772-product.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p>While I wore button-down shirts differently in my 20s (i.e. not with bike shorts), I wear them now as much as I do then, so it would've been worthwhile to invest in some nice ones in classic colors and prints, especially since they're not that big of an investment.

Sure, a black blazer may not be the world's most exciting thing, but think of all the non-boring things you can wear with it! My advice is, save up for a nice one made with quality material that will help it to drape nicely and last.</p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288930/fall-shopping-in-your-20s-288930-1598996226208-main.900x900uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288930/fall-shopping-in-your-20s-288930-1598986590943-product.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288930/fall-shopping-in-your-20s-288930-1598986576341-product.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p>When I got my first office job in my 20s, I quickly realized that I was going to need a big bag to transport everything I'd need in an 8-hour+ day.

A high-quality leather belt can last for years and be worn almost every day, if you so please. When you think about it that way, the cost per wear makes even a designer one seem like a steal.</p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288930/fall-shopping-in-your-20s-288930-1598986580659-product.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288930/fall-shopping-in-your-20s-288930-1598986585613-product.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288930/fall-shopping-in-your-20s-288930-1598986591794-product.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p>Warm accessories are not only essential—they can really make an outfit look expensive.

href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/naked-lingerie-trend\" target=\"_blank\">trend in underwear</a> is definitely the high-cut French brief.” Boom. You heard it here first, courtesy of <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/ext?tl=wJWdCteSN2XU4pU0GNAvVQZMvHBxnTkcWrU5CsLLhNd4MRJkciHDJ8ef522imbda_S-bCb-V54BsxCj-_N5L43QqZVRw1A8rFKHHGz5WNff8NlW-9stqLLQb64TKFnUlww\" target=\"_blank\">Journelle</a> Head of Product Development Sandra Rose, aka the woman in charge of knowing what’s new and next in the underwear space for one of the U.S.’s most-loved lingerie retailers. There are a couple of reasons to get on board with the trend, but my primary motive? The underwear style makes your <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/how-to-make-legs-look-longer-thinner-2014\" target=\"_blank\">legs look way longer</a>.</p><p>“With the band sitting at your natural waist, it gives you legs for days!” says Rose. <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/ext?tl=_BLgqzb6mbkVpfxQPyl5obXEg1Hg_wYZ4aLYk47GTSygkWFMJdGelMvI3A\" target=\"_blank\">Fleur du Mal</a> founder Jennifer Zuccarini agrees: “High-cut styles elongate the line of your leg and emphasize your waistline because they sit higher, on a smaller part of your waist, than, say, a hip-hugger style.” Another, more practical plus of the high-cut underwear trend? “With a higher rise, they are less likely to bunch when you’re wearing high waisted pants and skirts,” says Rose.</p><p>As for where the re-emergence of the high-cut French brief trend came from, Zuccarini attributes it to Instagram It models like Kendall Jenner, Bella and Gigi Hadid, and Emily Ratajkowski as well as ’90s supermodels. Just like with any trend, “it takes time and the right people wearing it again and again, for people to adopt a new look like this,” says Zuccarini.</p><p>Since the look has been gaining steam for a moment, the time is now to hop on the high-cut underwear trend. To help you with that aim, we rounded up the best options along with some visual inspiration to get started.</p><p><figure><img

Just like the brand's preceding roster of clean supplements, The Pill combines the best of both clinical and natural skincare findings in the form of a single-dose serum brimming with 27 nontoxic actives. These actives are skillfully brewed, so you're able to effortlessly layer all of the most skin-efficacious acids on the market sans confusion, thought, or potential safety or skin risks. For anyone who has ever felt flustered or unsure when it comes to layering skincare products, The Pill ($80) will be a regimen-streamlining dream come true.  Another positive side effect is that you'll notice both instantaneous and long-term results. The formula specifically targets puffiness, inflammation, and complexion-dulling dehydration in three unique ways to ensure you enjoy the delightful buzz of instant gratification alongside enduring, long-lasting results. Essentially, The Pill has the addictive appeal of a quick-fix complexion solution but with buildable, long-lasting, skin-improving powers as well. Dreamy, eh?  \"The Pill instantly brightens, exfoliates, hydrates, plumps, and tightens to create a ‘second skin’ effect,\" notes an official press release we received from the brand. \"Then, long-term, consistent once-daily application will also support the production of collagen and procollagen, reduce breakouts, increase skin hydration, and decrease fine lines.\" On its website, The Nue Co. provides the following findings in terms of results: In three minutes: \"89% of consumer testers reported instantly tighter, less puffy skin within three minutes of using The Pill. 95% of consumer testers reported instantly smoother and brighter skin within three minutes of using The Pill.\" In six weeks: \"87% of consumer testers reported more hydrated skin within six weeks of using The Pill daily every morning. 94% of consumer testers reported more radiant skin within six weeks of using The Pill daily every morning.\"</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288896/the-nue-co-the-pill-review-288896-1598981462812-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>Tightens and Decreases Inflammation: The Pill precisely targets skin inflammation using specific plant actives and proven calming compounds like grape-seed extract, glycyrrhizinate dipotassium (aka licorice-root extract), CBD, caffeine, and plant-based isoamyl laurate. They work harmoniously to reduce irritation and damage while tightening, hydrating, soothing, and softening the skin to keep the complexion's important lipid barrier intact and happily balanced.  Plumps and Moisturizes: Dew- and hydration-inducing humectants like hyaluronic acid, glycerin, galactoarabinan (GA/larch extract), and sodium PCA (the skin's natural moisturizing factor) tag team to ensure your skin can maintain healthy levels of moisture long-term while delivering smooth, ultra-plump results to the skin immediately.  Brightens and Exfoliates: The gang's all here! A dream-team complex of plant-derived AHAs like lactic, glycolic, mandelic, citric, malic, and tartaric acids come from lush sources like passionfruit, bilberry, and pineapple to gently resurface and brighten congested and dull skin. As a reminder, AHAs offer a chemical method of exfoliation as an alternative to physical exfoliation (e.g., scrubs) that can sometimes be harsh and irritating—especially for those with sensitive, easily provoked skin. The magic of AHAs happens when said acids dissolve the gummed-up bonds between skin cells, removing all of the dead stuff and, in turn, revealing softer, super-smooth skin.</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288896/the-nue-co-the-pill-review-288896-1598981469196-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>As far as your application protocol, the brand recommends a once-daily, morning-only dosage. Simply cleanse, apply two hearty pumps of The Pill all over your face, allow it to soak in for about two full minutes (brush your teeth!), and then moisturize. Since this serum contains everything except the kitchen sink in terms of skin-loving ingredients, there's no need to add any additional toners or serums into the mix. That said, the brand notes on its website that The Pill can safely be used alongside its holy-grail, ingestible formulas Skin Filter ($60) and Skin Hydrator ($45) daily. You can also safely use The Pill in conjunction with Topical - C ($70). Just start slowly and work your way up to your normal dose of C to minimize any potential skin irritation. Remember, vitamin C is another highly active ingredient, so we recommend sticking by the brand's best practices for optimal results. </figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288896/the-nue-co-the-pill-review-288896-1598981486655-main.1200x1365uc.jpg\"><figcaption>Rating: 4.5/5 stars. \"I'm not new to super-active serums, so any new product that claims to be more effective than the ones already on my vanity gets an immediate side-eye from me. Usually, I find that any company trying to push a 'miracle product' is really just pushing a bottle full of buzzy ingredients at percentages so high that they do make a significant difference right away but can also cause long-term damage to the skin barrier. As such, I tread lightly when it comes to serums that contain a ton of acids. \"On the other hand, everything I know about The Nue Co. leads me to believe that the brand really prioritizes research and the use of clean, bioavailable ingredients that call in science and ancient medicinal practices for full-spectrum support. I think this serum represents that ethos perfectly. While it's meant to resurface and renew the skin for big results on the outside, the formula also targets underlying issues like inflammation and hydration that super-active serums don't always take into account. \"I've toyed with using it both at night and in the morning, and even though the texture does remind me more of a daytime serum for some reason, I typically prefer to use my actives at nighttime. One evening, I layered the potent blend as the first step after a physical exfoliation, and the next morning, my skin looked so plump and smooth I could hardly believe my eyes. I have to admit that layering a formula with lactic, glycolic, citric, malic, and tartaric acids after buffing my skin probably isn't something I'd do again (that's just too much exfoliation!), but the results were so dreamy and proved to me just how potent and effective this serum is. I've been using it for over a week now and am really loving the results so far. Plus, it's clean! The only reason this serum doesn't get five stars from me is that I've found the recommended dose of two pumps isn't enough to spread evenly over my face and neck, so I can see it running out pretty quickly. At the price point, that's not ideal.\"</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288896/the-nue-co-the-pill-review-288896-1598981505721-main.1200x1365uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288896/the-nue-co-the-pill-review-288896-1598981521819-main.1200x1365uc.jpg\"><figcaption>Rating: 4.5/5 stars. \"I'll start this out by saying the one and only reason this serum isn't getting a full five-star rating from me is I simply haven't tried it long enough to provide a completely fair and objective review (especially considering the brand says half of the touted magic will be noticed more long-term, after about six full weeks or so). That said, I can very happily report a review on what I have noticed in the mere one week I've been slathering my face with the stuff: a new plump, bouncy, ultra-supple skin texture; a refined yet visible dewy glow (no oiliness or greasiness!); and an undoubtedly smoother, more refined skin texture.  \"While I'm very open about trying new haircare, bodycare, and makeup products with abandon, I'm annoyingly picky and scrupulous when it comes to what I put on my face. I read every last ingredient in anything that comes within a three-foot proximity of my complexion, and I'm wary of anything with lots of different actives or with fluffy marketing that makes a product seem too good to be true. So even though I've been a longtime fan of The Nue Co. and many of their ingestible supplements, I was immediately suspicious of a serum that's marketed to basically erase the need of my cabinet full of serums and tonics. The sheer number of acids and plant-based ingredients also made me nervous because my skin is incredibly sensitive and acne-prone, and anything with too much vim and vigor, or anything too natural, never typically sits well with my finicky complexion.  \"However, this serum has forced me to eat my worry. Courtney and I both vowed to apply the serum daily for a week straight, and I swear we ended up texting each other almost every morning of our experiment exclaiming how surprised and very much infatuated we were with The Pill. Thus far, I've experienced zero irritation (not even a sting!) from the potent formula, and the botanical ingredients have led to nary a pimple. Instead, I've only noticed completely positive results. Soft, luminous, plump, dewy, completely healthy-looking skin. \"Acid- and active-containing serums are infamous for their signature funky smells (think apple cider vinegar, decaying garbage, rotting flesh… kidding, kind of), but other than an ever so slight tinge of something slightly ACV-ish, there is no overwhelming odor to this, which makes it super tolerable and, heck, even enjoyable to apply each morning. All in all, this serum is super yummy, and my skin has been noticeably happier and well-behaved since I started using it. Again, I can't report on the purported long-term results, but I can vouch for all of the instantaneous, sparkly ones. I've been applying it after I double cleanse each morning (I swipe my face first with Sephora Collection's Triple Action Cleansing Water - Cleanse + Purify before going in with Shani Darden's Cleansing Serum) and before I apply my moisturizer for the day—usually Renée Rouleau's Skin Recovery Lotion ($44).\"</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288896/the-nue-co-the-pill-review-288896-1598981542388-main.1200x1365uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288896/the-nue-co-the-pill-review-288896-1598981593782-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>These skincare-supplement capsules feature a patented blend of vitamin C, zinc, champagne grape seed, and melon to improve the severity of sun damage (hello, luminosity!), pigmentation, acne, and skin elasticity. </figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288896/the-nue-co-the-pill-review-288896-1598981598098-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>The brand's clinically studied phytoceramides play nicely with hyaluronic acid, hydrolyzed collagen, and aloe vera and come packaged in easy-to-swallow capsules.

took residence in her bathroom. (My dad's electric shaver, bare bar soap, and a lone bottle of 2-in-1 shampoo and conditioner didn't stand a chance and were banished to a different bathroom downstairs.) Atop my mom's porcelain vanity sat her jars of creams and powders, and along the wall, deep drawers were lined with rows of sophisticated lipstick bullets. Atop gleaming glass shelves sat her collection of Chanel perfumes. Even at a super-young age (and knowing nothing of Chanel's iconic name), I understood with an inherent knowledge there was something supremely special about the gilded bottle stoppers and black lacquer detail. The name \"Chanel\" was effortlessly etched into my subconscious as the epitome of glamour and covetousness. Nearly 20 years later (and now me being a beauty editor), that etching hasn't faded. Of course, Chanel makes loads of holy grail beauty products that anyone with an affinity for nail polish, lustrously glossed lips, or glowing skin would want to hoard, but it's the brand's collection of iconic fragrances that will always represent the upper echelon of anything and everything pertaining to beauty. So because everyone should own at least one Chanel perfume in their life, we're paying homage to the brand by featuring its five best fragrances ever, followed by additional (similar) perfumes from other brands you definitely need on your shopping radar as well. Keep scrolling to see the five best-ever Chanel perfumes and their similar addicting counterparts.</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/285337/best-chanel-perfumes-285337-1580941598159-main.1200x1365uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/285337/best-chanel-perfumes-285337-1580941603145-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>Fragrance Family: Floral. Key Notes: Peony accord, passion fruit, vanilla. Slightly warmer than your typical floral (thanks to the mellow additions of cozy vanilla and shimmery mandarin), this Chanel masterpiece was created by Jacques Polge in 1996. I'm partial to it since it's been my mom's signature for as long as I can remember.</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/285337/best-chanel-perfumes-285337-1580941609249-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>Fragrance Family: Floral.

Key Notes: Jasmine, orange blossom, Grasse tuberose, ylang-ylang. Consider Gabrielle (which, ahem, Margot Robbie is the face of) your classic floral fragrance with kind of a fairytale twist. Famed perfumer Olivier Polge crafted this scent to represent an imaginary flower. It's equal parts rich, green, and elegant. </figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/285337/best-chanel-perfumes-285337-1580941633315-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>Fragrance Family: Floral.

Key Notes: Grapefruit, quince, rose accord, white musk. I may be biased, but Chanel's lush, fruity take on florals is my all-time favorite fragrance from the brand. Classic bouquet notes like rose and jasmine are modernized with fresh hints of quince and grapefruit while the warming comfort of musk keeps the finish smooth and enveloping.</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/285337/best-chanel-perfumes-285337-1580941659199-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>Fragrance Family: Floral .

Key Notes: Orange, patchouli, Turkish rose. If you're a fan of warm, earthy notes like patchouli but want something that still feels light and floral, then famed Chanel perfume Coco Mademoiselle will probably be your poison of choice. The mix of delicate rose and jasmine is brought to life with vibrant hits of orange and patchouli to create a robust and memorable scent. It's lively while still chic and sophisticated.</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/285337/best-chanel-perfumes-285337-1580941678410-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>Fragrance Family: Floral.

Key Notes: Aldehydes, jasmine, neroli, sandalwood. You knew this was coming. Chanel N°5 will always be perhaps the most iconic perfumes of all-time (and that extends beyond the scope of just Chanel, folks). Though this is a true, classic floral fragrance, it's powdery and full-bodied thanks to trademark notes of aldehydes, along with earthy anchors like neroli, bourbon vanilla, and sandalwood.</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/285337/best-chanel-perfumes-285337-1580941706305-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>Fragrance Family: Floral.

Wears","link":"http://feeds.whowhatwear.com/~r/WhoWhatWear/~3/7NV4dvKctlQ/best-oversized-clothing","description":"<p>If you're already obsessed with <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/hailey-bieber-fall-boot-trend\" target=\"_blank\">Hailey Bieber</a>, you know exactly what I'm talking about when I say \"oversize everything.\" But if you aren't as familiar with <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/hailey-bieber-leopard-face-mask\" target=\"_blank\">her style </a>as some of her biggest fans are, then let me fill you in: Hailey is definitely considered a major fashion icon as far as celebrity style goes, but one look in particular that she has nailed is anything oversize. We're talking everything from a head-to-toe baggy suit moment to a hoodie so big, she can wear it as a dress. In theory, re-creating that vibe seems simple, but unless you've tried to pull off an oversize T-shirt–and–baggy-jean moment à la Hailey, you haven't come to terms with just how difficult it actually is. </p><p>While it might seem like she just throws together a bunch of baggy clothes and calls it a day, the reality is that there is a method behind the madness, and today, I'm here to decode it for you. Ahead, I have rounded up some of my favorite \"oversize everything\" Hailey moments and shopped out exactly what you'll need to get the looks in addition to a brief explanation of why each ensemble works. After reading through and shopping accordingly, you'll leave here feeling ten times more confident in your ability to embrace loose clothing this fall. </p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288907/best-oversized-clothing-288907-1598921403320-main.1200x1598uc.jpg\"><figcaption>On Hailey Bieber: Vans Old Skool Sneaker ($60). Putting this look first because it is by far the easiest to re-create. Head to Amazon, order matching sweats in one or two sizes too big, and you've got yourself a Hailey Bieber–approved look. </figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288907/best-oversized-clothing-288907-1598905484495-main.800x0uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288907/best-oversized-clothing-288907-1598905557471-main.1000x1250uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288907/best-oversized-clothing-288907-1598905625605-main.1660x1783uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288907/best-oversized-clothing-288907-1598921410863-main.1200x1598uc.jpg\"><figcaption>On Hailey Bieber: Raf Simons shirt; Joah Brown Cropped Cami in Pearl Grey Flexrib ($56); EB Denim Levi’s Og Shorts ($215); Bottega Veneta Chain Mesh Sandals ($1180).

2020","link":"http://feeds.whowhatwear.com/~r/WhoWhatWear/~3/88bRv0AsoNk/best-tube-skirts","description":"<p>Jennifer Aniston's character Rachel Green of <em>Friends</em> was often spotted wearing the biggest fashion pieces of the moment, which included many of the major ‘90s trends we still remember today. Recently, I was watching an episode when it occurred to me that her maxi tube skirt was very <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/fashion-to-buy-for-fall\" target=\"_blank\">on-trend for 2020</a>. In fact, I’ve been seeing the long, slinky skirt all over Instagram recently and have started to see the piece landing in the new arrivals sections at my favorite retailers.</p><p>Poised to make a huge comeback this fall, tube skirts are without doubt a Rachel Green-approved trend to keep your eye on in the coming months. Not only is it a great comfortable yet stylish <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/relaxed-suiting\" target=\"_blank\">anti-loungewear</a> option to swap in for sweatpants, but it’s very versatile. Paired with a matching tube top, you can instantly recreate one of the most iconic looks from the ‘90s. However, you can also style one with an off-the-shoulder cropped cardigan or a one-shoulder tank to make it feel very 2020. Ahead, see inspiration for how to wear the trend and then shop my edit of the best tube skirts on the market.</p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288915/best-tube-skirts-288915-1598938218853-main.1000x1500uc.jpg\"><figcaption>Snapped on the set of Friends in 1996, here, Rachel Green wears the tube skirt trend.

Most importantly, you want to find one that matches your <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/best-lipsticks-for-every-skin-tone\" target=\"_blank\">skin tone</a><em> just so,</em> right? The goal is to choose a shade that looks like a second skin but better and that blends in with both your skin tones and undertones. And while you're searching, you'll also want to consider the type of coverage you need. Do you need something full? Or do you want to go with a sheer option?</p><p><strong>But there's one factor that I had never really given much thought to when shopping for a foundation: my skin type.</strong> It turns out choosing a product with your specific skin type in mind can make a difference when it comes to application and the finished look.

The experts gave me these tips for each type:</p><p><strong>Normal:</strong> \"Normal skin types are usually the easiest to use with foundation,\" says <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/ext?tl=8dYiw3Q59jqnDgMbRd2kzD85zaUnSxKW2N6Fhpn3QcvSHlpEnkvIbj42Zh1sFghlIMGk2E537A\" target=\"_blank\">Robert Sesnek</a>, makeup artist for <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/ext?tl=UMLN5N43Qt35LZhzy5gFUVT-EB-vePusMmQA6gC8uQ09Pklf4mdYAQc9zFN8anWtzQ\" target=\"_blank\">Catrice Cosmetics</a>. \"You can buff foundation with a damp natural hair foundation brush for an overall easy and even finish.\" So you can pretty much choose any foundation here, and Sesnek recommends a liquid foundation for all skin types because he says they look the most real on skin and can look \"invisible\" when applied properly.</p><p><strong>Combination:</strong> You'll want to look for oil-free and/or water-based foundations, according to our experts.</p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288926/best-foundations-for-combination-skin-288926-1599009394308-main.851x969uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><strong>Oily/Acne-Prone:</strong> \"You should look for an oil-free foundation if you have oily or combination-oily skin,\" recommends board-certified dermatologist <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/ext?tl=O6XW_Og2tuckGJCzI746cbWc2nNt6jsShrnG9IcgOiY0lnpxyq8XJYHbtXyS8lhFM3ccMpc6\" target=\"_blank\">Elyse Love</a>, MD, who practices at <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/ext?tl=Pfu5iRAlkSQZTR6Kjd-ujs6syt21LF3bHSwqu33m5LK-_4FyOw\" target=\"_blank\">GlamDerm</a> in New York City. \"Foundations can clog pores, which may cause bumps on the forehead and worsen dilated pores on the nose.

But <em>how</em> you prep can depend on... you guessed it, your skin type. Across the board, you should make sure <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/best-drugstore-face-washes\" target=\"_blank\">your skin is clean</a>, no matter your type, says makeup artist <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/ext?tl=WDkFW1pJw8MWiyVIRHGK0MgLN2SizPqBTPx4V1bzDcoy_s6e5qMy8ygYzJf2quleRzFwXSlvz-9O\" target=\"_blank\">Georgie Eisdell</a>, whose clients include Gwyneth Paltrow and Sophie Turner. She particularly loves IS Clinical's Cleansing Complex for combination skin.</p><p>After cleansing, you'll have to work on controlling some of the oil-prone areas if you have combination skin. \"My secret is to double up! In addition to a moisturizer best for combination skin, use a textured cotton pad with micellar water to scrub off any buildup on the skin's surface. This is key to preventing congestion from oil buildup under the skin,\" says <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/ext?tl=KrYxfOxgPIC-ouxP2GpoJxZADPPWrhCr64gkgwfQ-B1sE2LZkJ00_gKj9zOS-Gk9l7A3z74ToSFSlkH_MUte\" target=\"_blank\">Christine Cherbonnier</a>, who is Yoko Ono's personal makeup artist.</p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288926/best-foundations-for-combination-skin-288926-1599009515600-main.879x999uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p>When it comes to applying foundation, formulation choices are important to keep in mind. \"If you use a foundation that is too moisturizing when you have combination skin, you may find you get shiny very quickly,\" Eisdell explains. \"It's also not ideal to use a foundation that is all about moisture, as it will be too much for the combination skin and could cause breakouts.\"</p><p>Makeup artist <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/ext?tl=vq7ARnRrFkfeWhxX_xKVo2fzX-SHySHkbcM0pYszlWaO9YoLCNWbl9dkUKIteHQU1o4biJVTsrU\" target=\"_blank\">Tamah Krinsky</a> suggests going with a matte formula and a <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/best-powder-foundations\" target=\"_blank\">little bit of powder</a>. \"You don't want your skin to look heavy, so a sheer-matte formula with a touch to no powder should do the trick. You want to keep the powder light to let the natural oil in your skin keep the matte formula from looking too heavy,\" she says.</p><p>And now that you know what to keep in mind when shopping, you might be ready to add to your cart.

From Beyonce's bob to her full-length Stella McCartney dress, this look makes me want to sign a non-disclosure right now just so I can party with these two.  </p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/281901/beyonce-style-281901-1566246025776-main.850x1275uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><strong><span>This look kills me. Not only does Beyoncé prove yet again that her style game isn’t limited to the stage, but she’s rocking a polished all-denim look at Yeezy’s first fashion show next to our other queen, Rihanna. Consider me dead—the cause of my premature death? Too much fashion.  </span></strong></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/281901/beyonce-style-281901-1599151151300-main.850x1275uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p>I ain’t sorry for the following statement: Kim Kardashian West wearing a naked dress pales in comparison to Beyoncé’s 2015 Met Gala look. No one can re-create the queen; she’s just too much for all of us, and the moment she proved it is when she showed up late to the 2015 gala in this barely-there bejeweled Givenchy. Moments like these fill me with infinite gratitude to be living in the time of Beyoncé. </p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/281901/beyonce-style-281901-1566246156845-main.850x1275uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><strong><span>The wonderful thing about art of all forms is that it makes people uncomfortable. It can pose questions and raise awareness—and Beyonce’s performance at the 50th Super Bowl did just that. She performed </span><em><span>Formation</span></em><span> on the field in a black military-inspired leotard alongside her backup dancers rocking afros adorned with black berets. </span></strong></p><p><strong><span>Their looks paid homage to the Black Panthers 50 years after the group’s formation, and to say people were upset over these berets is an understatement. Granted they weren't actually upset about the style choices, the running joke happened to be that people forgot she was black until this performance. During it, they were clearly reminded. </span></strong></p><p><strong><span>But just to be clear, Beyoncé has always been black; she just also has happened to be beloved by all, which is why this style moment was one for the books. She used her platform to stand up for communities of color—to bring forth an important conversation around police brutality, and to reinform about the misconceptions of the Black Panther Party—via her performance and styling choices. Frankly, nothing is more stylish than that. </span></strong></p><p><span>There’s no denying that Beyoncé has created the tracks every self-proclaimed feminist bumps post-breakup. But one of the best gifts to the world was when she released her visual album, </span><em><span>Lemonade, </span></em><span>in 2016. In many ways, this is Beyoncé’s most unapologetic work; it gave us a raw glimpse into her reckoning with infidelity but was filled with visual moments that were unapologetically black and unapologetically stylish. While Beyoncé has always used her performances and music to represent her identity as a black feminist, each look within the visual album was calculated, chic, and most of all a call to action for all women of color to get in formation, throw their middle fingers up, and slay.  </span></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/281901/beyonce-style-281901-1599151128894-main.850x1275uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><strong><span>After releasing </span><em><span>Lemonade</span></em><span>, Jay was banned from being Bey's </span></strong><strong><span>date for a while, which is </span><em><span>totally </span></em><span>okay because we were blessed with seeing 4-year-old Blue Ivy show up to the 2016 MTV Video Music Awards with her mom, both in matching gowns.

Eleven days later she gave us arguably one of her most iconic performances, and looks, to date. Wearing a Peter Dundas creation (the same designer who created her the iconic yellow dress she wore in her </span><em><span>Hold Up</span></em><span> music video), she paid tribute to all the African, Hindu, and Greek goddesses that represented not only fertility but divine feminine energy at the 2017 Grammy Awards. In essence, Beyoncé was not only a literal goddess, but she was making a tribute to the goddess within all of us.  </span></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/281901/beyonce-style-281901-1599151115720-main.850x1275uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><strong><span>You better believe that Beyoncé didn’t share the first picture of the twins in any basic fashion—she actually broke the internet with this iconic photo of her holding them in an equally internet-breaking dress by Palomo.

Not only does Beyoncé per usual kill with a <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/beyonce-nba-all-star-game-outfit\" target=\"_blank\">chic courtside look</a>, but she left us wondering how far we'd go to photobomb this selfie situation.  </p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/281901/beyonce-style-281901-1567780255151-main.850x1275uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><strong><span>Beyoncé made history by being the first black woman to headline <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/beyonce-coachella-outfits\" target=\"_blank\">Coachella</a>, and if you haven’t seen Homecoming, her Netflix documentary,</span><span>about it yet then your life is incomplete. Her performance at Coachella could be defined as one of the best of her entire career—and the costumes are up there too. The clothing she wears for the performance not only pay homage to HBCUs and steppers, but those custom Christian Louboutin boots with holographic fringe are historic in and of themselves. </span></strong></p><p><span>Let it be historically recognized that 2018 was the year of Beyoncé. If Coachella wasn’t enough, </span><span>in Jay and Bey fashion, mid-tour they released their first joint album, </span><em><span>Everything Is Love</span></em><span>. </span><span>It was a response to their previous famed albums (</span><em><span>Lemonade </span></em><span>and </span><em><span>4:44</span></em><span>) to tell the story of their love.

Not only was it incredible to witness the compilation of two incredible artist’s work over a decade, but I may have shed a few tears in the presence of all the amazing looks from designers like Balmain, LaQuan Smith, Gucci, and Dunas.  </span></p><p>Beyoncé made history with this look—<em>quite literally</em>.

She was photographed in New York City wearing the trend in such an easy yet chic way: with all-white accessories to match the top. And no, she didn't forget her <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/kate-middleton-face-mask\" target=\"_blank\">face mask</a>—safety first!</p><p>Of course, tube tops are just the latest in a long line of trends that have come back from the '90s and 2000s. In fact, just this week, one of my colleagues wrote about the <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/best-tube-skirts\" target=\"_blank\">resurgence of tube skirts</a> á la Rachel Green from <em>Friends</em>.

href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/best-violet-grey-products\" target=\"_blank\">January Jones.</a> Was it her most iconic role to date as Betty Draper? Or smaller \"Oh my god, it's January Jones!\" roles in classic films like<em> Love Actually </em>circa 2003? Either way, we have major love for the actress's quirky real-life demeanor and, of course, amazing style and beauty aesthetic. (We have dozens of screenshots on our camera rolls to prove it.) Between her practically <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/how-to-minimize-pores\" target=\"_blank\">pore-less complexion</a>, playful approach to makeup, and <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/best-drugstore-hair-products\" target=\"_blank\">super-shiny strands</a>, we desperately want to know all her beauty secrets, especially considering she looks roughly half her 41 years.</p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/282841/january-jones-instagram-beauty-tips-282841-1570041395212-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p>We're super appreciative that we're not alone in our admiration, and Jones regularly listens to her fans' Instagram requests by posting ample intel about her beauty routine—from the supplements she swears by to the extensive skincare rituals she credits her glowing skin to. We did some major digging (the kind of digging that takes us from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m.) to compile a 13-point list featuring all of Jones's best beauty tips, secrets, and favorite products. Keep scrolling! Ahead, 13 reasons January Jones looks half her age. </p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/282841/january-jones-instagram-beauty-tips-282841-1596494382840-main.800x0uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/282841/january-jones-instagram-beauty-tips-282841-1570041402354-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>Take a scroll through Jones's Instagram, and you'll immediately notice the actress has a flair for a pretty punch of pink makeup—be it on her eyes or lips. The juicy hue brightens her complexion and definitely supports her youthful glow. We're not sure of the exact product ID here, but the latest Norvina launch from Anastasia Beverly Hills is the only palette people can talk about at the moment. </figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/282841/january-jones-instagram-beauty-tips-282841-1596494472320-main.1080x1349uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/282841/january-jones-instagram-beauty-tips-282841-1596494647423-main.800x0uc.jpg\"><figcaption>Jones knows that SPF is only one part of the equation for ample sun protection.

Plus, the A-list and beauty editors alike are obsessed with this cult-loved cream from Virtue Labs. The smell is intoxicating, and it's an amazing fix for rough ends in between your salon appointments. </figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/282841/january-jones-instagram-beauty-tips-282841-1596495055580-main.1080x1350uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p>After perusing her Instagram, we noticed she stays loyal to her skincare treatment plan and regularly visits <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/ext?tl=Oeaa67X951x8EtClcSq_9Nl_n5wFWMWqwI01DuTzx_NTm0-UPUb8k739c0B9zNTur19Y5hQVexF0\" target=\"_blank\">Jason Diamond</a>, MD, in Beverly Hills for non-surgical <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/ext?tl=t99Y1v_4AuBLw6BCjeSKDeJcctGoD9lYQhahf6hLAMsWPhLqBe-tg9V0UeARIVfA69knrc7X3OeQnaFSvAlVT6HB4gnQDw\" target=\"_blank\">Diamond InstaFacials</a>, which entail lasering, injections of platelet-rich plasma (from the patient), micro-needling, and a soothing mask to finish. </p><p>\"I just recently tried the PRP blood facial or 'vampire facial' by <a class=\"notranslate\" href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/ext?tl=OZxUK9sfeC62LEftw6bksbl-g-pOFmjmCzyD-NN5llCSaRL9rffx55T7RTzqI2cQlJxjfhaOvvSL\">@drjasondiamond</a> and am starting to see the results of that, it was fascinating, I’m trying to decide if it was worth the $$. I'll let you know,\" she explains in <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/ext?tl=wd1QagyL7j2XG39piOGtckcDCS_uaZjeZ2RAXO71xArv3MVUDeYUsmhr15FO7SqbFdzKJ0CGM08\" target=\"_blank\">this post</a>.</p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/282841/january-jones-instagram-beauty-tips-282841-1596495242725-main.1080x1350uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/282841/january-jones-instagram-beauty-tips-282841-1596495329471-main.1080x1148uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/282841/january-jones-instagram-beauty-tips-282841-1570041460709-main.1200x1200uc.jpg\"><figcaption>After noting she'd been sick and stressed (and healing with the help of a really great bubble bath—a theme we consistently notice on her IG), Jones touched on her gratitude and thankfulness. We're pretty sure that kind of recognition is just as important to aging gracefully as a decadent bath bomb or bath elixir.  (BTW—we know the actress is a big fan of beauty haven Violet Grey, and the above is our favorite bath accessory from the retailer.)</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/282841/january-jones-instagram-beauty-tips-282841-1596495625743-main.800x0uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p>We see Jones decked out in white face masks more than we do her chic swimsuits.

That’s exactly what happened when I first discovered <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/ext?tl=1pYsI5QnV-qGAjwha6-EoioIRUMZx-RCy0qHA-MbSlEqDbfaJrLe\" target=\"_blank\">Isa Boulder</a> back in January this year. Eager to find out more about the brand after spotting some photos of their stunning, ruched swimsuits on Instagram, I hoped to place an order, only to realize they hadn’t officially launched yet. My instincts told me they were about to be big, though.</p><p class=\"p2\">Fast-forward a few months and the brand is now <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/ext?tl=mH9vLNPt9mDuceNT6SyJDUxQ0gqyIpy9lNEt9ECgdI7UdTsF0sJ-M6DdeXDzoE6V4py3CZA9t_B1pb__EW3eiikozr_9CvY0KGtg5LHkTpJFILeq5udJZOgfJ0qhncvWypPvuAUOPVe83VAjuSK-ILbjb5NxyXHcGTgO-NaErbzerIaJizQEd0vkPamDGdHr2-JgRBmnmkhrn0nv3fpABb1BaF52wR1KeVMc60uJ67WVojgrynuc0Wl0zLyn2IrvL4yvenBdxMQJ0RbI12O2OoZwGyq0J4XBJnhJt-ZuQpP7p5tgUR3Oy4SVqToJTjlLZU58K0PmjpyOVAwh6Ii9BHFZbHSUdsDQvILVBgQMsK0DbBJvgFvcb6OdKKrKnrqbp4p2eoE2SIAmhtxD\" target=\"_blank\">sold on Matches Fashion</a> and has become a favorite of <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/fashion-to-buy-for-fall\" target=\"_blank\">insiders</a>. Interested to find out about Isa Boulder’s quick rise to cult status amongst the fashion set, I reached out to founders Cecilia Basari and Yuli Suri to find out more about the Bali-based brand. Ahead, read our interview as they dive into how they started out in swimwear, why local artisans are key to the brand, and the most popular pieces from the collection.</p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288696/isa-boulder-brand-review-288696-1597785634870-image.1080x1345uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288696/isa-boulder-brand-review-288696-1599028201863-main.1148x1643uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288696/isa-boulder-brand-review-288696-1599028784634-main.1226x1772uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288696/isa-boulder-brand-review-288696-1599077810554-main.1103x1683uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p class=\"p1\"><strong>Tell us about yourselves and your background in fashion.</strong></p><p class=\"p2\">One of us worked for a few years in the Bali garment industry as a pattern cutter, and the other graduated in womenswear from Central Saint Martins. We both wanted to create a business together which infused both our expertise and passion in garment making.</p><p class=\"p1\"><strong>What inspired you to start Isa Boulder?</strong></p><p class=\"p2\">We are very interested in the craft of making clothes and find joy in the continual process of discovering new ways to do so. Be it through a tactile method like crochet or something more technical like through experimental pattern cutting.</p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288696/isa-boulder-brand-review-288696-1597785780620-image.1080x1350uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288696/isa-boulder-brand-review-288696-1599028115847-main.1050x1407uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288696/isa-boulder-brand-review-288696-1599028104393-main.1145x1481uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p class=\"p1\"><strong>I read that you’ve never been photographed in swimsuits. Why did you decide to design swimwear?</strong></p><p class=\"p2\">We were acquaintances with a group of seamstresses who were dismissed from their jobs where they had been working in swimwear manufacturing for almost a decade. Hence, we were compelled to design our first collection swimwear-focused to make sure that while highlighting the skills of our colleagues, we were able to produce very high quality garments (or at least the best that we could). It wasn’t necessarily our idea to simply revolve our designs around this swimwear specialism. It was a good experience to familiarize ourselves with swimwear, as even though it’s small pieces of garments, they are actually a lot more tricky to perfect/sew well than people think. </p><p class=\"p1\"><strong>How would you describe the brand?</strong></p><p class=\"p2\">There is an emphasis on craftsmanship and whatever we design, we just want to make sure it’s the best possible quality pieces we feel we can achieve, and our items are not necessarily led by a certain trend or style, but coming from a starting point of technique and materiality. </p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288696/isa-boulder-brand-review-288696-1597785516385-image.1080x1350uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288696/isa-boulder-brand-review-288696-1599077817565-main.928x1566uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288696/isa-boulder-brand-review-288696-1599028239505-main.1283x1806uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288696/isa-boulder-brand-review-288696-1599028853866-main.1162x1660uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p class=\"p1\"><strong>Isa Boulder has established itself as a must-know emerging brand that has been a favorite among fashion insiders. How have you grown so quickly?</strong></p><p class=\"p2\">We feel very blessed that the women who have responded well to our items have since told friends of theirs, who then told friends of theirs, with the genuine desire to show support and love for our company. </p><p class=\"p1\"><strong>What is the inspiration behind your signature swimwear designs?</strong></p><p class=\"p2\">It started with the fabric, draping, and then figuring out what silhouettes would work well for the female form. </p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288696/isa-boulder-brand-review-288696-1597785548416-image.1080x1350uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288696/isa-boulder-brand-review-288696-1599028023099-main.1160x1415uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288696/isa-boulder-brand-review-288696-1599028035093-main.1100x1405uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p class=\"p1\"><strong>Why is it important to you to focus on sustainability and handcrafted pieces?</strong></p><p class=\"p2\">There are already so many garments in the world, it doesn’t make sense to rehash designs just for the sake of it. Even though in an ideal world we would steer clear from the fashion industry completely (since, at times, we do find that we’re in conflict with our moral values when noticing all these waste that we are contributing to the world especially after/during garment production), we are continually finding ways to minimize our negative impact on the environment through our bespoke approach to production and eventually focusing into knitwear. </p><p class=\"p1\"><strong>As an Indonesian brand, how does the local culture influence your company and designs?</strong></p><p class=\"p2\">We work very closely with local artisans and usually, our design process revolves around using techniques and production methods that have been passed down in generations. Through constant communication and a truly symbiotic relationship with the small manufacturers we work with, we have learned a lot from their technical experiences and skills. Most importantly, our aim is to ensure that while we grow as a small company, these small manufacturers also get to benefit from our growth.</p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288696/isa-boulder-brand-review-288696-1597785588272-image.1080x1350uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288696/isa-boulder-brand-review-288696-1599028337635-main.1073x1309uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288696/isa-boulder-brand-review-288696-1599028319027-main.1086x1332uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288696/isa-boulder-brand-review-288696-1599077836927-main.1167x1556uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/288696/isa-boulder-brand-review-288696-1599077835063-main.1112x1558uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p class=\"p1\"><strong>What are your must-buy pieces from the collection?</strong></p><p class=\"p2\">We feel that the ruched tops are very flattering for all cup sizes. We have heard many positive comments from women who are more flat-chested—they feel the ruching gives them volume which makes them feel very confident.</p><p class=\"p1\"><strong>What are the fresh ways to style your swimsuits this summer?</strong></p><p class=\"p2\">It’s nice to see swimwear outside of the context of the beach and also worn layered with casual clothes to downplay the fanciness/shininess of the satin swim fabric.</p><p class=\"p1\"><strong>Tell us about what’s next for Isa Boulder.</strong></p><p class=\"p2\">We hope to continue making clothes that make women

However, heavy earrings can also take a massive toll on the shape and condition of your ears. But before you toss out your favorite pair of oversize <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/best-earrings-for-sensitive-ears\" target=\"_blank\">earrings</a>, we recommend taking a look at what you can do to sport the trend without sacrificing comfort. Here are five essential tips for how to wear heavy earrings.</p><p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/251558/heavy-earrings-251558-1599155974876-main.1200x1598uc.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p>One of the major problems with heavy earrings isn’t just their weight but the way it’s distributed. The way earrings are designed, they can put an extraordinary amount of pressure on a very small portion of the ear. Try adding a small, near-invisible patch on the back of the ear, like Lobe Wonder <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/ext?tl=z-wJrAhgqZGss8k8UMDUXaQk-P7h5nKmdJxmNctJWRtfK60RBS0\" target=\"_blank\">Ear Support Patches</a> ($7), to alleviate the stress.
