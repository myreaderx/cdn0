Conventional material ingredients for these devices are typically made of homogeneous refractive or diffractive materials and require sophisticated design and fabrication, which results in practical limitations related to their form and functional figures of merit. To overcome such limitations, recent developments in the application of disordered materials as novel optical elements have indicated great potential in enabling functionalities that go beyond their conventional counterparts, while the materials exhibit potential advantages with respect to reduced form factors. Combined with wavefront shaping, disordered materials enable dynamic transitions between multiple functionalities in a single active optical device.

In this study, a site‐specific stress‐diffusive manipulation is demonstrated to fulfill highly robust and ultraflexible amorphous indium–gallium–zinc oxide (a‐IGZO) thin‐film transistors (TFTs) and integrated circuits. The photochemically activated combustion sol–gel a‐IGZO TFTs on a mesa‐structured polyimide show an average saturation mobility of 6.06 cm<sup>2</sup> V<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> and a threshold voltage of −0.99 V with less than 9% variation, followed by 10 000 bending cycles with a radius of 125 μm. More importantly, the site‐specific monolithic formation of mesa pillar‐structured devices can provide fully integrated logic circuits such as seven‐stage ring‐oscillators, meeting the industrially needed device density and scalability. To exploit the underlying stress‐diffusive mechanism, a physical model is provided by using a variety of chemical, structural, and electrical characterizations along with multidomain finite‐element analysis simulation. The physical models reveal that a highly scalable and robust device can be achieved via the site‐specific mesa architecture, by enabling generation of multineutral layers and fine‐tuning the accumulated stresses on specific element of devices with their diffusion out into the boundary of the mesa regions.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Sep 2020 08:35:07 +0000","feedId":6058,"bgimg":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/2d02b09a-e211-4f7c-a945-25a81bb25e2e/adma202003276-gra-0001-m.png","linkMd5":"9e6a3db44f197ca7f35b5ef8756f6a47","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn37@2020_1/2020/09/05/07-19-11-501_1416fafbd9ba7150.webp","destWidth":394,"destHeight":335,"sourceBytes":124464,"destBytes":124464,"author":"\nKyung‐Tae Kim, \nSanghee Moon, \nMinho Kim, \nJeong‐Wan Jo, \nChan‐Yong Park, \nSeung‐Han Kang, \nYong‐Hoon Kim, \nSung Kyu Park\n","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/2d02b09a-e211-4f7c-a945-25a81bb25e2e/adma202003276-gra-0001-m.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn37@2020_1/2020/09/05/07-19-11-501_1416fafbd9ba7150.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599290351385},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 15:19:11","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 15:19:11","title":"Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (Adv.

A new preparation strategy is developed to achieve individualization of cellulose microfibrils within the wood cell wall structure without introducing mechanical disintegration. The resulting mesoporous wood structure has a high specific surface area of 197 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>−1</sup> when prepared by freeze‐drying using liquid nitrogen, and 249 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>−1</sup> by supercritical drying. These values are 5 to 7 times higher than conventional delignified wood (36 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>−1</sup>) dried by supercritical drying. Such highly mesoporous structure with individualized cellulose microfibrils maintaining their natural alignment and organization can be processed into aerogels with high porosity and high compressive strength. In addition, a strong film with a tensile strength of 449.1 ± 21.8 MPa and a Young's modulus of 51.1 ± 5.2 GPa along the fiber direction is obtained simply by air drying owing to the self‐densification of cellulose microfibrils driven by the elastocapillary forces upon water evaporation.

The semiconductor twinning superlattice (TSL) forms in a single compound with periodically spaced twin boundaries and sharp interface junctions and can be grown with convenient synthesis methods. Therefore, employing semiconductor TSL may facilitate the development of optoelectronic applications related to superlattice structures.

Introducing lattice strain is an effective strategy to develop efficient electrocatalysts. However, lattice strain is typically co‐created with heterostructure, vacancy, or substrate effects, which complicate the identification of the strain‐activity correlation. Herein, a series of lattice‐strained homogeneous NiS<i>\n   <sub>x</sub>\n</i>Se<sub>1−</sub>\n<i>\n   <sub>x</sub>\n</i> nanosheets@nanorods hybrids are designed and synthesized by a facile strategy. The NiS<sub>0.5</sub>Se<sub>0.5</sub> with ≈2.7% lattice strain exhibits outstanding activity for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reaction (HER/OER), affording low overpotentials of 70 and 257 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>−2</sup>, respectively, as well as excellent long‐term durability even at a large current density of 100 mA cm<sup>−2</sup> (300 h), significantly superior to other benchmarks and the precious metal catalysts. Experimental and theoretical calculation results reveal that the generated lattice strain decreases the metal d‐orbital overlap, leading to a narrower bandwidth and a closer d‐band center toward the Fermi level. Thus, NiS<sub>0.5</sub>Se<sub>0.5</sub> possesses favorable H* adsorption kinetics for HER and lower energy barriers for OER. This work provides a new insight to regulate the lattice strain of advanced catalyst materials and further improve the performance of energy conversion technologies.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 01 Sep 2020 14:33:02 +0000","feedId":6058,"bgimg":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/91954502-91e2-49ea-8f55-daa78ae40acd/adma202000231-gra-0001-m.png","linkMd5":"550cf8f2a7baa24c995a815f93ba204c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn18@2020_2/2020/09/05/07-19-11-628_d83b0851722c5d28.webp","destWidth":394,"destHeight":323,"sourceBytes":116546,"destBytes":116546,"author":"\nYang Wang, \nXiaopeng Li, \nMengmeng Zhang, \nYuanguang Zhou, \nDewei Rao, \nCheng Zhong, \nJinfeng Zhang, \nXiaopeng Han, \nWenbin Hu, \nYucang Zhang, \nKarim Zaghib, \nYuesheng Wang, \nYida Deng\n","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/91954502-91e2-49ea-8f55-daa78ae40acd/adma202000231-gra-0001-m.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn18@2020_2/2020/09/05/07-19-11-628_d83b0851722c5d28.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599290351383},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 15:19:11","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 15:19:11","title":"ATP‐Responsive and ATP‐Fueled Self‐Assembling Systems and Materials","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adma.202002629?af=R","description":"<img src=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/f5be7582-aecd-4f06-8c72-a50896722be5/adma202002629-gra-0001-m.png\"\n     alt=\"ATP‐Responsive and ATP‐Fueled Self‐Assembling Systems and Materials\"/>\n<p>The use of ATP—the energy currency of life—for self‐assembling systems via non‐enzymatic and enzymatic mechanisms, which are categorized as ATP‐triggered unidirectional self‐assemblies, counter‐trigger‐mediated reversible self‐assemblies, and ATP‐fueled autonomous systems, is reviewed.

Integration of systems biology and nanomaterial engineering can resolve the problem of drug resistance and heterogeneity in cancer patients, and realize the power of precision medicine for the treatment of cancer.\n\n\n</p>\n<br/>\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Many clinical trials for cancer precision medicine have yielded unsatisfactory results due to challenges such as drug resistance and low efficacy. Drug resistance is often caused by the complex compensatory regulation within the biomolecular network in a cancer cell. Recently, systems biological studies have modeled and simulated such complex networks to unravel the hidden mechanisms of drug resistance and identify promising new drug targets or combinatorial or sequential treatments for overcoming resistance to anticancer drugs. However, many of the identified targets or treatments present major difficulties for drug development and clinical application. Nanocarriers represent a path forward for developing therapies with these “undruggable” targets or those that require precise combinatorial or sequential application, for which conventional drug delivery mechanisms are unsuitable. Conversely, a challenge in nanomedicine has been low efficacy due to heterogeneity of cancers in patients. This problem can also be resolved through systems biological approaches by identifying personalized targets for individual patients or promoting the drug responses. Therefore, integration of systems biology and nanomaterial engineering will enable the clinical application of cancer precision medicine to overcome both drug resistance of conventional treatments and low efficacy of nanomedicine due to patient heterogeneity.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 01 Sep 2020 09:01:39 +0000","feedId":6058,"bgimg":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/4a47f1f6-d97e-4966-be8d-2852d0e82cd0/adma201906783-gra-0001-m.png","linkMd5":"d4688097b573f13751a2ea6f182c5875","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn38@2020_3/2020/09/05/07-19-11-619_42ed5221b924603f.webp","destWidth":394,"destHeight":330,"sourceBytes":65408,"destBytes":65408,"author":"\nJae Il Joo, \nMinsoo Choi, \nSeong‐Hoon Jang, \nSea Choi, \nSang‐Min Park, \nDongkwan Shin, \nKwang‐Hyun Cho\n","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/4a47f1f6-d97e-4966-be8d-2852d0e82cd0/adma201906783-gra-0001-m.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn38@2020_3/2020/09/05/07-19-11-619_42ed5221b924603f.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599290351384},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 15:19:11","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 15:19:11","title":"Multidisciplinary Materials Research in KAIST Over the Last 50 Years","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adma.202000696?af=R","description":"","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 01 Sep 2020 09:01:39 +0000","feedId":6058,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"62b08330bc290cb155680aa2b381268d","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"\nSeong Kwang Hong, \nSang Ouk Kim, \nKeon Jae Lee\n","publishedOrCreatedDate":1599290351385},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 15:19:11","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 15:19:11","title":"Nanoscale Assembly of 2D Materials for Energy and Environmental Applications","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adma.201907006?af=R","description":"<img src=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/96363790-6987-43eb-a973-8c8c2161d66a/adma201907006-gra-0001-m.png\"\n     alt=\"Nanoscale Assembly of 2D Materials for Energy and Environmental Applications\"/>\n<p>Nanoscale assembly—the precise control over the complex interface between layers—is essential to promote continuous progress of 2D materials, especially in energy storage and conversion and environmental remediation.

Here, the thermally induced complete reconstruction (TICR) of molybdate oxygen evolution reaction (OER) pre‐catalysts at 51.9 °C and its fundamental mechanism are uncovered. The dynamic reconstruction processes, the real active species, and stereoscopic structural characteristics are identified by in situ low‐/high‐temperature Raman, ex situ microscopy, and electron tomography. The completely reconstructed (CR) catalyst (denoted as cat.‐51.9) is interconnected by thermodynamically stable (oxy)hydroxide nanoparticles, with abundant boundaries and low crystallinity. For alkaline OER, cat.‐51.9 exhibits a low overpotential (282.3 mV at 20 mA cm<sup>−2</sup>, 25.0 °C) and ultrastable catalysis at 51.9 °C (250 h, with a negligible activity decay of 19.6 µV h<sup>−1</sup>). The experimental observations combined with theoretical analyses confirm the fast catalytic kinetics enabled by the co‐effect of boundaries and vacancies. The coupled cat.‐51.9 and MoO<sub>2</sub>‐Ni hydrogen‐evolving arrays provide stable electrolysis operation at 51.9 °C for 220 h.

Thus, production of nanovaccines has to date failed to exploit biology‐only processes like complex sequential post‐translational biochemical modifications and scalability, limiting the realization of the initial promise for offering major performance advantages and improved therapeutic outcomes over conventional vaccines. A Nano‐B5 platform for in vivo production of fully protein‐based, self‐assembling, stable nanovaccines bearing diverse antigens including peptides and polysaccharides is presented here. Combined with the self‐assembly capacities of pentamer domains from the bacterial AB<sub>5</sub> toxin and unnatural trimer peptides, diverse nanovaccine structures can be produced in common <i>Escherichia coli</i> strains and in attenuated pathogenic strains.

However, developing X‐ray detectors that are stable and sensitive to hard X‐rays (80 to 120 keV) for practical medical imaging is highly desired. Here, a sensitive 2D fluorophenethylammonium lead iodide ((F‐PEA)<sub>2</sub>PbI<sub>4</sub>) perovskite single‐crystal hard‐X‐ray detector from low‐cost solution processes is reported. Dipole interaction of organic ions promotes the ordering of benzene rings as well as the supramolecular electrostatic interaction between electron‐deficient F atoms with neighbor benzene rings. Supramolecular interactions serve as a supramolecular anchor to stabilize and tune the electronic properties of single crystals. The 2D (F‐PEA)<sub>2</sub>PbI<sub>4</sub> perovskite single crystal exhibits an intrinsic property with record bulk resistivity of 1.36 × 10<sup>12</sup> Ω cm, which brings a low device noise for hard X‐ray detection.

However, the atomic‐scale regulation of such active sites for NRR catalysis remains challenging because of the large distance between them, which significantly weakens their cooperation. Herein, the utilization of regular surface cavities with unique microenvironment on graphitic carbon nitride as “subnano reactors” to precisely confine multiple Fe and Cu atoms for NRR electrocatalysis is reported. The synergy of Fe and Cu atoms in such confined subnano space provides significantly enhanced NRR performance, with nearly doubles ammonia yield and 54%‐increased Faradic efficiency up to 34%, comparing with the single‐metal counterparts. First principle simulation reveals this synergistic effect originates from the unique Fe–Cu coordination, which effectively modifies the N<sub>2</sub> absorption, improves electron transfer, and offers extra redox couples for NRR. This work thus provides new strategies of manipulating catalysts active centers at the sub‐nanometer scale.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Sep 2020 14:21:33 +0000","feedId":6058,"bgimg":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/ac060a71-a388-4339-8568-2d36bf25837c/adma202004382-gra-0001-m.png","linkMd5":"cb6652397ed2c72ff929bde523093a5f","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn41@2020_3/2020/09/05/07-19-11-735_2f650e5389e255cf.webp","destWidth":394,"destHeight":340,"sourceBytes":67206,"destBytes":67206,"author":"\nXiaowei Wang, \nSiyao Qiu, \nJianmin Feng, \nYueyu Tong, \nFengling Zhou, \nQinye Li, \nLi Song, \nShuangming Chen, \nKuang‐Hsu Wu, \nPanpan Su, \nSheng Ye, \nFeng Hou, \nShi Xue Dou, \nHua Kun Liu, \nGao Qing (Max) Lu, \nChenghua Sun, \nJian Liu, \nJi Liang\n","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/ac060a71-a388-4339-8568-2d36bf25837c/adma202004382-gra-0001-m.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn41@2020_3/2020/09/05/07-19-11-735_2f650e5389e255cf.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599290351386},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 15:19:11","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 15:19:11","title":"Reduced Graphene Oxide‐Encapsulated Microfiber Patterns Enable Controllable Formation of Neuronal‐Like Networks","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adma.202004555?af=R","description":"<img src=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/c68e4716-3f44-4284-97e6-8805d4a39bc5/adma202004555-gra-0001-m.png\"\n     alt=\"Reduced Graphene Oxide‐Encapsulated Microfiber Patterns Enable Controllable Formation of Neuronal‐Like Networks\"/>\n<p>Conductive microfiber scaffolds are fabricated by combining near‐field electrostatic printing (NFEP) and layer‐by‐layer (L‐b‐L) assembly technologies.

Although nanoimprinting, extreme ultraviolet, electron beams, and scanning probe litho‐graphy are candidates for developing such nanopatterns, they are limited to complicated procedures with low throughput and high startup cost, which are difficult to use in various academic and industry fields. Recently, several easy and cost‐effective lithographic approaches have been reported to produce ≈10 nm scale patterns without defects over large areas. This includes a method of reducing the size using the narrow edge of a pattern, which has been attracting attention for the past several decades. More recently, secondary sputtering lithography using an ion‐bombardment technique was reported as a new method to create high‐resolution and high‐aspect‐ratio structures.

A comprehensive overview of the mechanisms and metabolism of PHA biosynthesis, and strategies for strain development, fermentation, and downstream processing toward the cost‐effective production of natural and nonnatural polyesters having diverse material properties is provided. Additionally, applications of PHAs and future prospects are discussed.\n\n\n</p>\n<br/>\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Microorganisms produce diverse polymers for various purposes such as storing genetic information, energy, and reducing power, and serving as structural materials and scaffolds. Among these polymers, polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are microbial polyesters synthesized and accumulated intracellularly as a storage material of carbon, energy, and reducing power under unfavorable growth conditions in the presence of excess carbon source. PHAs have attracted considerable attention for their wide range of applications in industrial and medical fields. Since the first discovery of PHA accumulating bacteria about 100 years ago, remarkable advances have been made in the understanding of PHA biosynthesis and metabolic engineering of microorganisms toward developing efficient PHA producers. Recently, nonnatural polyesters have also been synthesized by metabolically engineered microorganisms, which opened a new avenue toward sustainable production of more diverse plastics. Herein, the current state of PHAs and nonnatural polyesters is reviewed, covering mechanisms of microbial polyester biosynthesis, metabolic pathways, and enzymes involved in biosynthesis of short‐chain‐length PHAs, medium‐chain‐length PHAs, and nonnatural polyesters, especially 2‐hydroxyacid‐containing polyesters, metabolic engineering strategies to produce novel polymers and enhance production capabilities and fermentation, and downstream processing strategies for cost‐effective production of these microbial polyesters. In addition, the applications of PHAs and prospects are discussed.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 01 Sep 2020 09:01:39 +0000","feedId":6058,"bgimg":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/25bce6a8-c3a6-4694-b927-bf26ce315f7a/adma201907138-gra-0001-m.png","linkMd5":"4b831f3979349b4574039d8d602b21ee","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn50@2020_4/2020/09/05/07-19-11-503_d05f4fd183a47c96.webp","destWidth":394,"destHeight":319,"sourceBytes":80540,"destBytes":80540,"author":"\nSo Young Choi, \nIn Jin Cho, \nYoungjoon Lee, \nYeo‐Jin Kim, \nKyung‐Jin Kim, \nSang Yup Lee\n","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/25bce6a8-c3a6-4694-b927-bf26ce315f7a/adma201907138-gra-0001-m.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn50@2020_4/2020/09/05/07-19-11-503_d05f4fd183a47c96.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599290351383},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 15:19:11","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 15:19:11","title":"Single‐Cell Nanoencapsulation: From Passive to Active Shells","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adma.201907001?af=R","description":"<img src=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/753ce58b-4aeb-44ec-834e-5cc06e340f56/adma201907001-gra-0001-m.png\"\n     alt=\"Single‐Cell Nanoencapsulation: From Passive to Active Shells\"/>\n<p>Recent developments in single‐cell nanoencapsulation suggest that the field has advanced to the formation of active shells for cell‐in‐shell structures. These active‐shell structures are involved in the dynamic regulation of cellular processes while protecting the cells inside.\n\n\n</p>\n<br/>\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Single‐cell nanoencapsulation is an emerging field in cell‐surface engineering, emphasizing the protection of living cells against external harmful stresses in vitro and in vivo. Inspired by the cryptobiotic state found in nature, cell‐in‐shell structures are formed, which are called artificial spores and which show suppression or retardation in cell growth and division and enhanced cell survival under harsh conditions. The property requirements of the shells suggested for realization of artificial spores, such as durability, permselectivity, degradability, and functionalizability, are demonstrated with various cytocompatible materials and processes. The first‐generation shells in single‐cell nanoencapsulation are passive in the operation mode, and do not biochemically regulate the cellular metabolism or activities. Recent advances indicate that the field has shifted further toward the formation of active shells. Such shells are intimately involved in the regulation and manipulation of biological processes. Not only endowing the cells with new properties that they do not possess in their native forms, active shells also regulate cellular metabolism and/or rewire biological pathways. Recent developments in shell formation for microbial and mammalian cells are discussed and an outlook on the field is given.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 01 Sep 2020 09:01:39 +0000","feedId":6058,"bgimg":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/753ce58b-4aeb-44ec-834e-5cc06e340f56/adma201907001-gra-0001-m.png","linkMd5":"db739983b90d9fbc0074e9d396927368","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn54@2020_1/2020/09/05/07-19-11-499_b3f1739d658cb54f.webp","destWidth":500,"destHeight":135,"sourceBytes":25232,"destBytes":25232,"author":"\nWongu Youn, \nJi Yup Kim, \nJoohyouck Park, \nNayoung Kim, \nHyunwoo Choi, \nHyeoncheol Cho, \nInsung S.
