Not the stale, overhyped prior revolution that had just passed &#8212; but a new, exciting revolution.This time, things would be different. This new revolution would change the way we thought about technology. This revolution would change the business. This revolution would bring the power of information technology to the masses. A revolution unlike any other revolution that ever came before it.  The most incredible, unbelievable, paradigm-shifting revolution ever.  Yada, yada.  Promises, promises.  Here are a few revolutions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In the late 1980s, it was client/server computing &#8212; sticking a PC in front of a larger computer.</li>\n<li>In the late 1990s. it was Web computing &#8212; sticking a browser in front of a network.</li>\n<li>In the late 1990s, it was dot-coms &#8212; sticking a browser in front of a store.</li>\n<li>In the early 2000s decade, it was Web services and XML &#8212; sticking standardized code in front of an application.</li>\n<li>In the late 2000s decade, it was cloud &#8212; sticking a cloud in front of everything.</li>\n<li>And lots of revolutions in between &#8212; usually sticking something in front of something else.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note on the above list: some would call these techniques &#8220;putting lipstick on a pig.&#8221;</p>\n<p>And when I would come home for dinner at night, or saw friends over the weekend, nobody would ask me what I was up to, and eyes would glaze over if I attempted to tell them. I wouldn&#8217;t even attempt to begin to explain to people what I had been writing about all day long. What&#8217;s so revolutionary about speeding up a purchase order process or building a rules engine that reduced exception reporting?  What&#8217;s revolutionary about displaying 3270 &#8220;green-screen&#8221; code within a terminal emulation window? (Good stuff every business should pursue &#8212; but not something that will make you the life of the party.)</p>\n<p>Then, one day a couple of years ago, I came home &#8212; and found my daughters (tween and teen) actively participating in the revolution.  The social networking revolution.  An information-technology revolution had finally hit home, and in a big way.  Unlike the decades of vendor pronouncements about revolution, this one was real.  The old order was being driven out &#8212; by employees and children of employees.</p>\n<p>I knew this time, it was different. So, my daughters may someday ask me: &#8220;What did you do in the Social Networking Revolution, Daddy&#8221;*? I will tell them about the writings my colleagues and I did here at the FastForward site. And where the revolution took us.</p>\n<p>Social media was more than a platform or a new mode of computing &#8212; it was a new way of connecting, of doing business, of leading nations, of working, of making friends and renewing friendships.  But, for purposes of this site, first commissioned in December 2006, the theme was to explore to unfolding new world of Enterprise 2.0 in work and business settings.  Consider where the social revolution has taken us in just a few short years:</p>\n<p><strong>Personal outsourcing:</strong> For the first time, employees all up and down the line have access to information they need to do their jobs better, advance companies, and advance their careers.  John Schmidt so accurately described it as &#8220;<a href=\"http://www.fastforwardblog.com/2007/04/11/heres-a-concept-i-like-personal-outsourcing/\" target=\"_blank\">personal outsourcing</a>.&#8221; Unlike the traditional model for outsourcing — firms contracting out functions or processes to an outside firm — “individuals  are starting to outsource their problem-solving and their own  professional development,” he says. “They’re leveraging things like  wikis, blogs, other collaboration events to collaborate in real-time  with other individuals.”<strong> </strong>IT professionals go to Google, Wikipedia, and other online sources of  support, Schmidt says. “They write out their question in their blog and  look for their community to respond and help them. …they extended their  network of peers to outside the four walls of their company. …they’re  taking their problems and their professional challenges to the world.”</p>\n<p><strong>Economic revitalization and opportunity:</strong> Social networking and E2.0 provides a vast new array of tools for seeking out new markets, as well as managing through the tough times. Companies have means to <a href=\"http://www.fastforwardblog.com/2008/12/02/harvards-mcafee-proposes-enterprise-20-for-economic-recovery/\" target=\"_blank\">better leverage </a>the knowledge coursing through their corporate veins to turn around distressed lines of business. Employees have <a href=\"http://www.fastforwardblog.com/2008/12/01/recession-20-meet-enterprise-20/\" target=\"_blank\">tools to ride through tough times</a>, by staying well-connected with their professional networks and potential employers &#8212; even after they have been laid off. They no longer have to be powerless victims of recessions. (I called it the LIFT phenomenon &#8212; LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter.) Employers have a resource to identify key talent to build their organizations.</p>\n<p><strong>Improving the quality &#8212; and joy &#8212; and therefore productivity &#8212; of work: </strong> The 9-to-5 rut had been withering on the vine for a number of years, and social networking is putting the final stakes in the industrialized, command-and-control model of management.  Productivity is not something that occurs in a cubicle between 9 and 5, it&#8217;s something that comes in &#8220;bursts.&#8221; Social networks and E2.0 give everyone the flexibility and connectivity to respond to those bursts. In the process, the lines between work and personal life have not only just blurred &#8212; they&#8217;ve disappeared completely. Some Gloomy Guses say that&#8217;s not a good thing, and that employers will exploit it. I say it&#8217;s a real good thing.  People should be proud of their work, and have the passion raging within them to want to pursue it, think about it, and embed it into their lives.  Good riddance, 9 to 5.</p>\n<p><strong>Return on investment:</strong> A hotly debated topic. But the ROI is there. McKinsey &#38; Company, for one, did countless studies the past few years that proved it. A couple of years back for example, they published the results of a <a href=\"http://www.mckinseyquarterly.com/Business_Technology/BT_Strategy/How_companies_are_benefiting_from_Web_20_McKinsey_Global_Survey_Results_2432\" target=\"_blank\">survey of nearly 1,700 executives</a> from around the world which paints a highly positive picture of the business returns being seen from E2.0 deployments. Close to seven out of ten respondents (69%) report that their companies “have gained <em>measurable</em> business benefits [italics mine], including more innovative products  and services, more effective marketing, better access to knowledge,  lower cost of doing business, and higher revenues.”</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s been close to five years that we have been covering the revolution &#8212; a real revolution &#8212; at this site. And it&#8217;s only just begun.</p>\n<p>(*By the way, the title of this post is a paraphrase of the 1966 movie &#8220;<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061176/\" target=\"_blank\">What Did You Do in the War, Daddy?</a>&#8221; in which a bunch of soldiers in World War II hosted a street festival in an Italian town.  One could say social networking is a global festival of sorts.)</p>\n<div
