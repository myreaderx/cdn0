Bromberg went on to find more footage, discover Valray&#8217;s first film, and secure the rights to restore and distribute them. Splendid in their restored versions (with curved corners on the frame), the films are at once generic and pleasingly perverse.</p>\n<p><em>La Belle de nuit</em> (1934) is a boulevard melodrama with hints of <em>Vertigo</em> and <em>Les Dames du Bois de Boulogne</em>. When a playwright discovers his wife has cheated on him with his best friend, he plots vengeance. By chance (i.e., dramaturgy) he finds a prostitute who is almost a dead ringer for the wife. He dresses her up, installs her in an apartment, and coaxes her to adopt a remote, mildly mocking manner. Of course, the treacherous best friend is in a frenzy to possess her. Wait till he learns about the past of his new passion.</p>\n<p><em>La Belle de nuit</em> alternates rather flat scenes of bourgeois flirtation with bursts of cinematic energy. Like other early sound films, there are some sharp auditory transitions. Dynamic <a href=\"http://www.davidbordwell.net/essays/hook.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">hooks link scenes</a> with sounds, images, or both: automobile wheels, locomotives, phonograph records.. There are peculiar angles and, most noticeably, a fascination with the unattainable woman. As ever, cigarette smoke helps the mystique.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Belle-500.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-47114\" src=\"http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Belle-500.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"368\" srcset=\"http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Belle-500.jpg 500w, http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Belle-500-150x110.jpg 150w, http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Belle-500-408x300.jpg 408w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></a></p>\n<p>I suspect that Valray learned a lot from making this first film because I found <em>Escale</em> a more polished production. Like his debut, it centers on a fallen woman who hangs around hazy cafes where hard-used women stroll among tables and sing about the troubles of life. Jean, an uptight lieutenant on passenger ships, falls in love with Eva, who hangs around smugglers in her seaport town. Jean and Eva share an idyll, and she seems redeemed. But when Jean leaves on a voyage, Eva&#8217;s loyal manservant Zama can&#8217;t keep her from succumbing to the mesmeric bootlegger Dario.</p>\n<p><em>Escale</em> has more exquisite visuals than <em>La Belle de nuit</em>. Filmed on a lush Mediterranean island, it bathes its landscapes and sea vistas and seedy port with a languid melancholy akin to that of <em>Pépé le Moko</em> (1937). Practically every shot, on land or sea or in the alleys or the boudoir, yields brooding, hypnotic imagery.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Eva-1-500.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-47118\" src=\"http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Eva-1-500.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" srcset=\"http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Eva-1-500.jpg 500w, http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Eva-1-500-150x113.jpg 150w, http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Eva-1-500-400x300.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></a>     <a href=\"http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Eva-2-500.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-47120\" src=\"http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Eva-2-500.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" srcset=\"http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Eva-2-500.jpg 500w, http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Eva-2-500-150x113.jpg 150w, http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Eva-2-500-400x300.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Ship-1-500.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-47119\" src=\"http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Ship-1-500.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" srcset=\"http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Ship-1-500.jpg 500w, http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Ship-1-500-150x113.jpg 150w, http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Ship-1-500-400x300.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></a>     <a href=\"http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Tunnel-500-1.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-47121\" src=\"http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Tunnel-500-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" srcset=\"http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Tunnel-500-1.jpg 500w, http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Tunnel-500-1-150x113.jpg 150w, http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Tunnel-500-1-400x300.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></a></p>\n<p>I find <em>Escale</em>&#8216;s villain far scarier than the fussbudget playwright of <em>La Belle de nuit</em>.

The story is that the New Taiwanese Cinema of the 1980s, developed by Hou Hsiao-hsien, Edward Yang, and others, created a fresh turn toward social realism and more adventurous storytelling. Their tales of rural life and urban anomie clashed with the entertainment genres of commercial cinema and the government-sponsored films asserting that under Chiang Kai-shek&#8217;s Kuomintang regime life was buoyant and carefree. With <em>The End of the Track</em> we have a fine predecessor, a &#8220;parallel&#8221; film that dared formal and thematic opposition to the mainstream, and did so well before the New Wave directors.</p>\n<p>Yung-shen&#8217;s father and mother run a noodle cart; Hsiao-tung&#8217;s family is well-off. But the boys are fast friends. They enjoy long days in their rural paradise&#8211;swimming naked, play-fighting, and exploring caves. The film&#8217;s first twenty-five minutes are almost plotless, built out of routines of school, play, and homework. But then a crisis strikes, and the film turns achingly sad in a quiet, unmelodramatic way. The plot shifts slowly to a study of how one boy becomes a surrogate son for a grieving family, while his own parents respond uncomprehendingly.</p>\n<p>The boys&#8217; skinny-dipping and mud wrestling earned the film a ban for &#8220;homosexual undertones and ideology.&#8221; There&#8217;s surely a homosocial, and maybe homoerotic undercurrent, but the main impression is that of devoted friendship and the heavy weight of obligation. One boy must leave childhood behind, too soon, and start a new life. Just as powerful is the class component. In one grueling sequence, Yung-shen&#8217;s parents try to push their cart through typhoon-swept streets as Hsiao-tung&#8217;s parents look on from their car.</p>\n<p>Pictorially, director Mou Tun-fei makes full use of the glorious scenery that rural Taiwan can yield. He uses fast cutting, handheld shots, abrupt flashbacks, and other &#8220;modern cinema&#8221; techniques. These techniques can be seen in many commercial Taiwanese films of the period, but most directors used them to jazz up generic plots. Here, the fastidious black-and-white palette gives them a certain sobriety. The gravity is enhanced by severe but lyrical compositions, like this planimetric shot of the boys laying out a running track.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/boys-500.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-47127\" src=\"http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/boys-500.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"269\" srcset=\"http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/boys-500.jpg 500w, http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/boys-500-150x81.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></a>.</p>\n<p>Above all, the slow pace of the film&#8211;the basic story is almost an anecdote&#8211;allows Mou to soak us in the characters&#8217; milieu. There are even some prolonged, static long shots that look ahead to the precisely unfolding scenes we get in Hou&#8217;s films and in Yang&#8217;s <em>A Brighter Summer Day</em> (1991).</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Stall-500.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-47128\" src=\"http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Stall-500.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"269\" srcset=\"http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Stall-500.jpg 500w, http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Stall-500-150x81.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></a>     <a href=\"http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Stall-2-500.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-47129\" src=\"http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Stall-2-500.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"495\" height=\"269\" srcset=\"http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Stall-2-500.jpg 495w, http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Stall-2-500-150x82.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 495px) 100vw, 495px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Mou is now, like Valray, a rediscovered director enjoying belated fame in his national cinema. In a <a href=\"https://www.electricshadows.be/lecture-voices-of-youth/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">very helpful discussion</a> of his career, Wafa Ghermani and Victor Fan point out that there was at the period an important trend toward independent, low-budget films in Taiwanese (rather than the official language of Mandarin), and Mou&#8217;s work is just one example. As usual, a festival  screening can remind us that there&#8217;s a lot more powerful cinema out there than we&#8217;ve realized.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>Her time has come</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Ann-H-600.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-47105\" src=\"http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Ann-H-600.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Ann-H-600.jpg 600w, http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Ann-H-600-150x85.jpg 150w, http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Ann-H-600-500x282.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></a></p>\n<p><em>Keep Rolling</em> (2020) isn&#8217;t an old film, but it&#8217;s about a director who has over forty years quietly carved her own niche in world cinema.</p>\n<p>In the 1980s, a new generation of filmmakers overturned Hong Kong cinema. Some, like Tsui Hark, Jackie Chan, and John Woo, brought a turbocharged version of the New Hollywood to a film culture already energized by a tradition of martial-arts action. Other young talents formed what came to be called the Hong Kong New Wave. Although Tsui was sometimes identified with this, this trend was not so brash. It moved toward social realism, with directors like Allen Fong and Stanley Kwan exploring a modernizing Chinese culture living under colonial rule but forging its own identity.</p>\n<p>Of all the New Wave directors, Ann Hui distinguished herself by her sincere and dogged attention to Hong Kong life as it is lived. After making some docudramas for television, she directed her first feature, <em>The Secret</em> (1979) and won festival attention with <em>Boat People</em> (1982) and <em>Song of the Exile</em> (1990). Although she has happily embraced genre films&#8211;she has made ghost stories and thrillers&#8211;she always treats sensational material with a calm, unspectacular attention to characterization and mood. Her swordplay film, the two part <em>Romance of Book and Sword</em> (1987), emphasizes landscape and interpersonal drama over action set-pieces. Who else would make <em>Ah Kam</em> (1996), a martial-arts movie centering on a stuntwoman?? She brought attention to social problems, sometimes in advance of social policies: caring for a parent suffering from dementia (<em>Summer Snow</em>, 1995), the need to shelter victims of marital abuse (<em>Night and Fog</em>, 2009), and lesbian rights in Hong Kong (<em>All About Love</em>, 2010).</p>\n<p>In all, she has directed twenty-eight features. Every one has been a struggle.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Ann-on-bench-500.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-47132\" src=\"http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Ann-on-bench-500.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" srcset=\"http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Ann-on-bench-500.jpg 500w, http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Ann-on-bench-500-150x84.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Because the local market has been small, Hong Kong filmmakers have had to look abroad. For directors like Tsui and Woo, that meant making flamboyant action vehicles for audiences across East Asia, as well as for the Chinese diaspora and fans in other territories. But Ann Hui&#8217;s commitment to local life meant that her films had to gain wider attention on the red-carpet circuit. They did. Over the decades, they routinely played the major festivals. Her <em>A Simple Life</em> (2011) got a standing ovation when it played Ebertfest in 2014; <a href=\"http://archive.ebertfest.media.illinois.edu/sixteen/a-simple-life.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Roger called it</a> one of the year&#8217;s best films.</p>\n<p>Last year Kristin and I were sorry we couldn&#8217;t be in Venice to watch her accept a Golden Lion for Lifetime Achievement. In response to my email of congratulation, she was characteristically modest in facing a 14-day quarantine when she returned home. As ever, she makes personal contact:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\"><strong>Tonight I am dead beat n have a whole day of press tomorrow before I leave on the day after.  I promise myself I’ll only stick to filmmaking from now onwards.  How r u and is the pandemic bad in your area?  HK is bad all the way you must know.  Will u still come n visit us?  Take care n keep well!  Ann</strong></p>\n<p>Ann&#8217;s career receives a fitting tribute in Man Lim-chung&#8217;s <em>Keep Rolling</em>. It  surveys her life, with fine interviews with her sister and brother, along with comments from friends and critics. There&#8217;s a lot of behind-the-scenes production footage. Above all, Man offers a personal portrait of her persistence and dedication. Virtually the only female director to make a career in Hong Kong, she has contributed to the world&#8217;s humanist cinema shaped by directors like Kurosawa, Kiarostami, and  Satayajit Ray. Stubbornly sincere, with no PoMo flash or trickery, her small-scale studies of character always have wider social resonance. One can only hope that this film brings her&#8211;and her films, shamefully neglected on DVD&#8211;to more audiences.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The four films reviewed above are all available from the Festival <strong>across the USA</strong> until midnight Thursday.
