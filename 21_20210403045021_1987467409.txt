The Daphne character (portrayed by <strong>Phoebe Dynevor</strong>) will be back for season 2 after marrying Page&#8217;s character, the Duke of Hastings, but the Duke will not appear in season.

A woman escaping from an abusive relationship. A tech mogul with too much power and not enough humanity. A general sense of chaos and an awareness that the world is always on the verge of a total meltdown. Sometimes, all we can do is laugh through the pain and the series does just that – the tinges of horror and the big science fiction ideas are always balanced by surreal, riotous comedy and a stunning lead performance from <strong>Cristin Milioti</strong>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/made-for-love-review/\">I loved the first episode</a> of <em>Made for Love</em> when it premiered at SXSW. And I loved the additional three episodes, which were sent to me ahead of my interview with showrunner <strong>Christina Lee</strong>, director <strong>Stephanie Laing</strong>, and writer/executive producer <strong>Alissa Nutting</strong> (who also wrote the book on which the series is based). I sat down with all three of them over Zoom to chat about the series, how it balances comedy with genre storytelling, how the cast brings their oddball characters to life, and whether or not there are already plans for a second season.</p>\n<p>The first three episodes of <em>Made for Love</em> are streaming now on HBO Max. Additional episodes will arrive weekly.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-665165\"></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>This is the best first episode of something I’ve seen in a while. And the opening minutes – within five minutes, I’m in. Can you talk about the idea of dropping us into this weird, wild world immediately?</b></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Lee:</strong> Yeah, I feel like that came about really in the editing process. We had considered several different ways to start the show. What we knew that we wanted was to feel like you’re on a ride right away and that there’s a lot of information coming at you and this is exciting and you’re seeing these different worlds and filling in the holes along the way. With that intention, I think in the editing room we really saw how we wanted to start the show and that sort of informed more of the writing and directing as we went forward because we were able to shoot a few episodes before we shut down for the pandemic. During that time, we went back and said, “What’s something we want to see here in the pilot episode that we now have the luxury of thinking of and writing and being able to go back and do that?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Laing:</strong> And there’s nothing better than surprising people. When we were able to reflect on it, when we we were shut down, it’s like, there’s nothing better than dropping in on something and not beating somebody over the head. It’s so compelling. “I want in. I want to know what this is, and I’m going to stay.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Nutting:</strong> We were really pleased the way it fit thematically, too. Because one of the things that the show is really considering is kind of how do you escape from a relationship? And in some ways, is that even possible given memory, given feelings, given the process of grief? Does a marriage end the moment you decide to get divorced? Does it end in a courtroom? Does it end when you’re finally able to move on? All of these questions are coming into play, so we also just loved the idea of this immediacy of escape in a show that is consistently asking, “Will she be able to escape?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>When I posted my review, a number of people messaged me saying, “You should read the book, too – it’s wonderful.” I’ve made the tough choice to wait until the show is over to read the book. With that said, having not read the source material myself yet, was it tough to edit your own work and beat it into shape having a team around you? What was the process of reshaping this?</b></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Nutting:</strong> The story is essentially about starting over, in both the hope and excitement and, in some ways, impossibility of doing that. So for me it was a very organic process and organic decision to say, “This is a different medium. This is going to demand different things in storytelling.” I want to start over without starting over, taking these characters and themes and spinning something new and unique and wonderful. I was so blessed to have Christina and Stephanie as partners in that storytelling, and was able to create something really special with them.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Lee:</strong> I want to really credit Alissa, because her novel is very internal and she really wanted to expand and adapt from the world, and we talked a lot about what does that mean? It was her decision that she wanted to feel the other perspectives of the characters. In the book, for example, you don’t really know where Byron’s coming from, and in the series, you will.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>The show is so well-directed. It looks great and the visual comedy is really there. I’m so tired of comedies where they put the camera down and say, “The actors are funny. Let it happen.” There’s such a visual wit in your work in the first episode, Stephanie, that continues into the four episodes that I’ve seen. Can you talk about finding comedy in the filmmaking?</b></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Laing:</strong> Absolutely. I mean, listen, collectively, I’m going to say something super cheesy: working with Alissa and Christina, I felt like we had a mind meld. We were all very much in sync from the very beginning, and we’d have the same notes. In between takes, it’d be like, “I’m going to do this,” and [someone else would say], “I was just about to say that!” In terms of bringing it to life visually, we created our own language. We weren’t afraid, and I credit Christina and Alissa in trusting me to do that. We really tried stuff. For me, it was always about the point of view, and I think the best way to film comedy is to not forget that. Whose point of view is this? You can do a cool shot for cool shot’s sake, but there’s no emotion behind it.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">There’s nothing better than letting something play out, leaving the frame and coming back in and knowing, also, when to move the camera. When not to move the camera. When to sit still and take a breath. It doesn’t happen by accident. It’s very specific. We shot-listed every single thing. We didn’t make up anything on the day. We were very prepared going in, because I know with television your time is so limited. Especially shooting during COVID, we did ten hour days. So we had a plan and we really stuck to it. And then we have tremendous actors. I can’t say enough about how much – we filmed something, but then in a wide, Billy or Cristin would improvise something and it’d be amazing and we would sort of run with that. I would set up a shot around something that they did, which was really rewarding and awesome. I’m so glad that you found it refreshing, because that was the goal.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>There’s a shot in the first episode where the camera remains at a distance as Cristin Milioti runs toward a car and tries to open the door with beer cans in her hand, and just the camera holds back – the filmmaking itself made me laugh.</b></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Laing:</strong> Oh, thank you. I also laughed on the first take of that shot, because it was so clear that there was some subtle physical comedy. She couldn’t get the door open and there was one take where part of the door did come off, because it was a really old truck. I just thought, “We’re going to hang back. We don’t need to be with her. We know she’s getting in the car.” So sometimes it’s just trusting the audience, and again, we don’t need to bang you over the head with this. We’re going to see her in the truck with a person. It’s OK to hang back and see what she does. Physically, Crisitin is so fantastic at that. But how a character runs, how a character walks, all of that goes into the comedy and the performance and the emotion. That particular shot, the choice was just left, like, “I don’t need to be close with her. I need to see her getting into this truck and escaping.” And her struggle with the beer and the sunglasses and the door, it’s human, it’s real. Sometimes, that’s also where comedy comes from: humanity, and the comedy comes from the pain. The reality when you’re trying to escape, and how do you open this when you have a lot of shit in your hand? The beer is important to her in that moment.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>This show is really funny, but its world feels complete. The science fiction of the series feels like it holds water, and the world of <i>Made for Love</i> feels just shitty enough to be real. Can you talk about balancing the sci-fi world building with the fact that it’s also a relationship comedy?</b></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Lee:</strong> We had a lot of those conversations and we played around a lot with that, too. If I told you about some of the silly places that Alissa and I went with the script that we had to pull back on…because our tendencies are toward comedy. What was so great was the team that was around us, some of the people had a comedy background, some of the people had a more dramatic background. So the team that came together, we found this nice balance which was very purposeful. We wanted to tell a sci-fi story that felt different, because we all discussed how we wanted to show a sci-fi story through a female lens. We talked a lot about what does that mean? What have we been missing from sci-fi stories that we’ve seen in the past? That was of the foremost importance, and in that, we wanted heavily to go into the emotional journey of the characters. So that lends itself to be more on the drama side, but I think that the things that make us laugh are all the same. What Stephanie said, the three of us, it’s like we had a chip in our brains. The same weird things would make us laugh, and echoing what Stephanie said, it’s always from a place of realness as opposed to writing a joke. So while you have this dramatic, fantastical scene, the things that are making us laugh are the very human moments that you have. So that tone was found throughout, both in writing and shooting it. And the tone was very easy to find with our actors, who I think approach everything from a very grounded point of view.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Nutting:</strong> I think with tech and sci-fi, so often there’s an emphasis on avoidance or even eradication of emotion and feeling, or even sensation, that it’s all very serious and stripped down. When you think of robots, you don’t think of laughter. Part of us really wanting to imbue this sci-fi story with emotion and warmth, we felt that humor had to stay a critical part of it.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>I asked my wife what stood out to her in these four episodes, and she said she loved the fact that Hazel is not scared. She is surprised and angry, but she has not spent the entire series so far cowering in fear. That was important to her to see a female lead who was fighting back like that.</b></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Lee:</strong> First of all, thank your wife. That’s a very astute observation, and I’m so glad that came across. In a lot of the content that we discuss that we love, that we’re fans of, by the way, we are often following the victim, the one who’s watched, and that person doesn’t have a lot of agency. That’s a key point that we wanted to change, in that we wanted to give her agency. While she is a victim in some ways, she’s finally taking control of her own life and we wanted to see what that looks like. We’ve seen a lot of people running for their lives, but then what happens? That’s the story we wanted to tell.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Cristin Milioti is amazing, and may be one of the best actresses working right now. The one-two punch of this and <i>Palm Springs</i> solidifies her as a person where I’m going to see everything she does. Can you talk about building this character for her and how she was cast? She must have been cast when she was on the verge of <i>Palm Springs</i> happening, right?</b></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Nutting:</strong> Yeah, it was prior to all of that. She was the only choice. I always joked, “<i>Made for Love</i> was made for Milioti.” She was the only one. I’d seen her dramatic [work] in <i>Fargo</i> and <i>Black Mirror</i>. I knew from her stage work and <i>How I Met Your Mother</i> just how funny she is. There’s really nothing she can’t do. Cristin really helped inform and build this character with us. It was very much a partnership. Her role is so multilayered, and she has to be one character in the Hub, and then she’s another character when she’s out of the Hub. So often, she has to let the viewer know how she’s actually feeling or what she actually thinks is different than what she’s saying aloud or what she’s doing, especially in the Hub. So her attention to nuance and her ability to convey so much with an expression or with her eyes, every episode is such a remarkable performance.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Laing:</strong> I was going to say, for me, when I was directing her, she’s so good, to what Alissa is saying, in the subtleties. I’d be like, “Let’s see a peek of Hub Hazel here with Ray,” and she would just bring it with one look of her eye. “Yep, there she is.” Just finding the levels of performance in everything we did. “Let’s do this take with Hub Hazel and this take with more real world Hazel,” and really fine-tuning that with her – she’s incredible. I can’t imagine there being anyone else in this, other than her.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Over the course of the past decade, I’ve enjoyed watching Ray Romano grow from sitcom star into such an interesting actor. Not all people who start out as comedians can do the work he’s been doing over the past ten or fifteen years. Can you talk about bringing him into this and what he brought to the role that wasn’t on the page?</b></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Lee:</strong> Yeah, be brought a lot to the role and that character changed because of Ray. The initial characteristics of that father, Herbert, was that he was rough around the edges and he was harder to love and a tougher character to embrace. So it made it really challenging when Hazel came home. But Ray, there’s so much humanity to him, so much vulnerability. You just really love him. Even when he is behaving badly, you feel empathy for him. So he actually changed the way that we wrote that character throughout the series, for the better. I think the character became much more nuanced and believable than sort of a traditional bad dad. You really feel for their relationship and how they’re coming back together in the series, especially in the back end.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>I want to talk about Billy Magnusson. It’s a really interesting performance. If you jump in a time machine, go back in time 20 years and show people this performance, they’d say, “This guy is an alien. How does he exist?” But somehow, Byron feels like the quintessential villain of 2021 in so many ways. Can you talk about tapping into a very specific type of 21st century bad guy?</b></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Lee:</strong> I think Billy also has a lot of humanity, too. I think there’s something in every performance that he’s bringing to it. It’s the same thing that was with Cristin. It was like, “All right, let’s tap into why Byron is who he is.” Alissa alluded to it earlier: we understand a little more about where he’s coming from. So when we get glimpses of that in his performance – although in the first two episodes, you may not know what you’re seeing – it really does pay off later on. That, to me, is how he’s able to become a Byron that we also love, even though he’s terrible.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Laing:</strong> There were times where we’d get notes from the network, and they’d be like, “Wait, are we rooting for them to get back together? I like him!” We were like, “I know!” There are some times where I feel for him.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Nutting:</strong> Yeah, it’s really a credit to his acting and also Billy as a person. The level of empathy that he really brought to this role and to the character, the levels at which he wanted to understand him really helped all of us understand him better. It really shifted the path of the character going forward.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Laing:</strong> Yeah, it really felt like a true collaboration on every level. The three of us basically had a chip implanted in our brains, but then were able to take that and elevate this material with this world that Alissa created. And the details matter, which is why we so appreciate your review, because you noticed that. Every frame mattered. There wasn’t any ounce of us letting go of any small things. Everything mattered.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>You mentioned the network giving you notes. I’m curious about the relationship between you and HBO Max and how the subject matter of this show is something that we’re finally talking about now. It’s been something that’s been whispered about since as long as human beings have existed, but we’re actively having these conversations about what <i>Made For Love</i> is about out in the open. Was HBO Max like, “Yeah, this is the time, let’s do it”? What were the conversations like to make sure the show could be honest about this stuff?</b></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Lee:</strong> I think they were totally game. We had so many conversations with them and among ourselves about what role technology plays in our own lives, especially in this past year. That was sort of interesting, because we were talking about the shortcuts that technology provides in terms of human connection before the pandemic, and then we enter a year in which we’re relying entirely on technology for human connection. We made some changes in our approach to the show while we were shut down, but HBO Max was fully game and they encouraged us to go there. They loved the tech aspect of it. I credit them with saying, “Let’s see even more of that.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Is the plan here that this is just a miniseries, it wraps up the book, and it’s over? Are you leaving any doors open for a season 2, or even an anthology approach where each season is a different story? Have you talked about that at all? </b></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Nutting:</strong> We really fell so in love with these characters and the actors playing them, but also the themes and the questions and the conversations, as you mentioned, around technology. There’s so much there, we would absolutely love to do a season 2, yeah.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Could all of you share a movie or TV show that you think would pair really well with <i>Made for Love</i> that our readers should watch before or after this?</b></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Laing:</strong> This is a funny one, because the content is completely different.

The streamer, which knows a thing or two about <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/haunting-of-bly-manor-spoiler-review/\">haunted houses</a>, has landed the <strong>Sam Raimi</strong>-produced horror movie <em>Every House is Haunted</em>, based on Ian Rogers&#8217; collection of supernatural short stories.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-665184\"></span></p>\n<p>Deadline reports that the <em>Every House is Haunted</em> movie will be coming to Netflix. Written by <strong>Jason Pagan</strong> and <strong>Andrew Deutschman</strong>, <em>Every House is Haunted </em>will be directed by <strong>Corin Hardy</strong>, best known for helming <em>The Nun</em> and episodes of <em>Gangs of London</em>. Raimi will be producing the movie alongside Zainab Azizi for Raimi Productions, with Roy Lee for Vertigo Entertainment and Vertigo’s Andrew Childs executive producing.</p>\n<p>In <em>Every House is Haunted</em>, &#8220;An insurance investigator tries to debunk claims that a couple’s death was caused by a haunted house, but his doubts are challenged by a psychic and the mysterious occurrences he witnesses with his own eyes.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The feature film is based on Ian Rogers&#8217; collection of short stories published in 2012. Here is the synopsis for the <em>Every House is Haunted</em> short story collection (via <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15904026-every-house-is-haunted\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">GoodReads</a>):</p>\n<blockquote><p>In this brilliant debut collection, Ian Rogers explores the border-places between our world and the dark reaches of the supernatural. The landscape of death becomes the new frontier for scientific exploration. With remarkable deftness, Rogers draws together the disturbing and the diverting in twenty-two showcase stories that will guide you through terrain at once familiar and startlingly fresh.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The film, however, won&#8217;t be an anthology of all the stories, but based primarily on the short story &#8220;The House on Ashley Avenue<em>.&#8221;</em> The story follows a pair of paranormal investigators who try to find out why the house on Ashley Avenue isn&#8217;t on the real estate market, with the film taking a few liberties with the premise (one insurance investigator versus two, a mysterious murder, etc.).</p>\n<p>But it seems like <em>Every House is Haunted</em> is in good hands, with a big horror name like Raimi producing — through the filmmaker&#8217;s financing deal with Starlight, which optioned the short story collection — and Hardy directing after taking on the<em> Conjuring</em> spin-off film <em>The Nun</em>. And of course, it&#8217;s got a welcome home at Netflix, which has found major success with haunted house titles, and the horror market in general, particularly with Mike Flanagan&#8217;s <em>Haunting of Hill House</em> anthology series. Per Deadline, Netflix came in with the strongest bid for <em>Every House is Haunted</em> after the project was shopped around Hollywood.</p>\n<p>No cast or release date has yet been set for <em>Every House is Haunted</em>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/every-house-is-haunted-movie-netflix/\">Sam Raimi-Produced Horror Movie &#8216;Every House is Haunted&#8217;

But in the new true crime thriller <strong><em>Above Suspicion</em></strong>, she&#8217;s just a desperate woman trying to escape a dead end coal-mining town in Kentucky any way she can.</p>\n<p>Susan Smith (Clarke) thinks her big ticket out of town has arrived when FBI agent Mark Putnam (<strong>Jack Huston</strong>) uses her as an informant, even going so far as to strike up an intimate relationship with her while the case unfolds. But when the job is done, he skips town and goes back to his wife and kids, leaving Susan high and dry. And that&#8217;s just not something she&#8217;s going to tolerate. Listen to Emilia Clarke&#8217;s Southern accent and see how far she&#8217;s willing to go in the <em>Above Suspicion</em> trailer below.<span id=\"more-665193\"></span></p>\n<h2>Above Suspicion Trailer</h2>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lJnmaDLRx5k?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>If the premise itself didn&#8217;t already sound worthy of an episode of <em>Jerry Springer</em>, there&#8217;s also the added twist of Susan Smith being pregnant, which makes the FBI agent even more of a scumbag. Meanwhile, <strong>Johnny Knoxville</strong> is also kicking around as a seemingly scorned former lover who doesn&#8217;t want anything to do with Susan now that she&#8217;s been kicked to the curb. It all feels like a gritty Lifetime movie, and not even the fact that it&#8217;s based on a true story is doing the material any favors.</p>\n<p>The only hope that this movie might turn out better than it seems is that it&#8217;s directed by <strong>Phillip Noyce</strong>, who previously directed <em>The Bone Collector</em>, <em>Patriot Games</em>, and <em>Clear and Present Danger</em>. At the same time, the last major movie he helmed was the underwhelming adaptation of <em>The Giver</em>, so he seems to have lost his touch in recent years.</p>\n<p>The rest of the cast includes <strong>Sophie Lowe</strong>, <strong>Austin Hébert</strong>, <strong>Karl Glusman</strong>, <strong>Chris Mulkey</strong>, <strong>Omar Miller</strong>, <strong>Kevin Dunn</strong> and <strong>Thora Birch</strong>. But it&#8217;s probably not going to be the kind of movie they&#8217;re happy to see in parentheses next to their name.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Based on the true story of one of the most notorious crimes in FBI history, this gritty crime-thriller stars Emilia Clarke (“Game of Thrones”) as Susan Smith, a young woman desperate to escape a seedy life of crime and drugs in a Kentucky coal mining town. When a newly minted FBI agent named Mark Putnam (Jack Huston, “Fargo”) recruits Susan as his informant for a high-profile case, she believes her bad luck may finally be changing. But as Susan and Putnam’s relationship deepens, so does the danger, setting them both on a collision course with deadly consequences.</p></blockquote>\n<p><em>Above Suspicion</em> arrives in select theaters and on VOD starting on <strong><em>May 14, 2021</em></strong>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/above-suspicion-trailer-emilia-clarke-is-an-fbi-informant-consumed-by-jealousy-and-desperation/\">&#8216;Above Suspicion&#8217; Trailer: Emilia Clarke is an FBI Informant Consumed by Jealousy and Desperation</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=JE7X_grBiGI:DVsXW_UAn5E:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=JE7X_grBiGI:DVsXW_UAn5E:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=JE7X_grBiGI:DVsXW_UAn5E:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=JE7X_grBiGI:DVsXW_UAn5E:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=JE7X_grBiGI:DVsXW_UAn5E:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=JE7X_grBiGI:DVsXW_UAn5E:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/JE7X_grBiGI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 02 Apr 2021 23:00:50 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/abovesuspicion-emiliaclarke-pissed-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"b6c72501f16b70389089995e576e5aae","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn24@2020_2/2021/04/03/04-50-07-382_b7758058d6fe4d49.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":20046,"destBytes":9564,"author":"Ethan Anderton","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/abovesuspicion-emiliaclarke-pissed-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn24@2020_2/2021/04/03/04-50-07-382_b7758058d6fe4d49.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=JE7X_grBiGI:DVsXW_UAn5E:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn88@2020_3/2021/04/03/04-50-10-537_9fa2c07bb72b1b23.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn57@2020_5/2021/04/03/04-50-11-348_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=JE7X_grBiGI:DVsXW_UAn5E:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn92@2020_4/2021/04/03/04-50-11-221_a4c13bb7e7ce7211.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/JE7X_grBiGI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn77@2020_1/2021/04/03/04-50-14-022_37ac7266a8770157.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617425343645},{"createdTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:03","updatedTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:03","title":"‘Yasuke’ Trailer: LaKeith Stanfield is the Legendary Black Samurai in Netflix’s New Anime","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=665207","description":"<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-665214\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/yasuke-700x349.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"349\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/yasuke-700x349.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/yasuke-360x180.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/yasuke-768x383.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/yasuke.jpg 1440w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>In 16th century Japan, an African slave became the first-ever Black man to step into the country, piquing the interest of Japanese warlord Oda Nobunaga.

Only this time, he&#8217;s fighting mechs and magic.</p>\n<p>The trailer promises a gory, action-packed anime series, with impressive character design by director and animator <strong>Takeshi Koike</strong> (<i>Lupin the Third: The Woman Called Fujiko Mine</i>) and music by Grammy-nominated artist Flying Lotus. But I do have to say that Stanfield&#8217;s very recognizable timbre is a tad distracting. There&#8217;s an ongoing conversation about casting <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2011/10/how-celebrities-took-over-cartoon-voice-acting/247481/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">celebrities in voice acting roles</a>, and while Stanfield is a talented actor, I&#8217;m still not convinced he will deliver as a voice actor, which requires a very different acting muscle than screen acting.</p>\n<p>Still, <em>Yasuke</em> has an impressive creative team behind it, with MAPPA and Koike lending credibility to the Netflix anime, which is more than you could say for the streamer&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/pacific-rim-the-black-spoiler-review/\">many other attempts</a> to corner the anime market. And since we&#8217;re likely not going to get the live-action <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/yasuke-cast-chadwick-boseman/\">feature film about Yasuke</a>, which originally was set to star the lateChadwick Boseman, this is a more than worthy alternative.</p>\n<p>Here is the synopsis to <em>Yasuke</em>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The tale is set in a war-torn feudal Japan filled with mechs and magic, the greatest ronin never known, <i>Yasuke</i>, struggles to maintain a peaceful existence after a past life of violence. But when a local village becomes the center of social upheaval between warring daimyo, <i>Yasuke</i> must take up his sword and transport a mysterious child who is the target of dark forces and bloodthirsty warlords. <u></u><u></u></p></blockquote>\n<p><em>Yasuke</em> is set to debut on Netflix on <strong>April 29, 2021</strong>.

Each of those new services fall under parent companies who also own movie studios, but only one of them hasn&#8217;t yet taken full advantage of that relationship.</p>\n<p>Even though Peacock falls under the Comcast banner that includes Universal Pictures, the NBCUniversal streaming service isn&#8217;t exclusively streaming any of the movie studio&#8217;s major franchises like <strong><em>Fast and Furious</em></strong> or <strong><em>Jurassic Park</em></strong>. But it sounds like that could change in the near future as NBCUniversal is considering the possibility of making Universal Pictures movies exclusive to Peacock.<span id=\"more-665218\"></span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-31/comcast-weighs-pulling-universal-s-movies-from-hbo-max-netflix\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bloomberg</a> has news that NBCUniversal is currently trying to figure out if they want to end licensing deals with the likes of HBO Max and Netflix in order to build the library of movies that are exclusive to Peacock. Right now, HBO Max has a deal that gives them the rights to play Universal Pictures movies nine months after they leave theaters. Meanwhile, Netflix does the same thing with Universal&#8217;s animation studio Illumination Entertainment, which includes the <strong><em>Despicable Me</em></strong> and <strong><em>Secret Life of Pets</em></strong> franchises. Both of these deals are up at the end of the year.</p>\n<p>A decision hasn&#8217;t been made by NBCUniversal yet simply because they&#8217;re trying to figure out if it&#8217;s more beneficial to make these movies exclusive to Peacock in order to boost their subscription numbers. If franchises like <em>Fast and the Furious</em>, <em>Jurassic Park</em> and <del>the Dark Universe</del> the Jason Bourne series become exclusive to Peacock, then Universal doesn&#8217;t make as much money from selling the licensing rights to other streamers. But there is the possibility of seeing a hybrid approach to these streaming deals.</p>\n<p>Last year, Universal was already leaning towards striking new deals to license movies to other streaming services. But the coronavirus pandemic apparently put a hold on those negotiations, hence the potential move to Peacock. One possible outcome could see Peacock sharing the streaming rights to Universal Pictures movies with one of the other streaming services. For example, Peacock shares the streaming rights to the hit series <em>Modern Family</em> with Hulu. Doing the same with some of Universal&#8217;s movies would be a way for NBCUniversal and Universal Pictures to have the best of both worlds.</p>\n<p>As of now, Peacock is probably on the lower end of the streaming wars right now. Their library of exclusive titles isn&#8217;t all that impressive, which is why the price of the subscription tiers is directly linked to how much of <em>The Office</em> you want to be able to watch. But Peacock is in the midst of building a library of original shows, including the the reboot of <em>Saved by the Bell</em>, the upcoming comedy <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/rutherford-falls-trailer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Rutherford Falls</em></a>, a new series <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/poker-face-rian-johnson/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">from <em>Knives Out</em> director Rian Johnson</a>, an adaptation of <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wild-cards-tv-series-moves-to-peacock/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">George R.R.

The <em>Child&#8217;s Play</em> spin-off series was supposed to start shooting last year but COVID-19 got in the way. Now, <em>Chucky</em> co-creator <strong>Don Mancini</strong> has revealed that the SYFY series is finally in production – and that we&#8217;ll likely get to see it this fall. The series follows a suburban town plunged into chaos when a Good Guy doll turns up at a yard sale. <strong>Devon Sawa</strong> is part of the cast, as is original Chucky voice actor <strong>Brad Dourif</strong>. And on the heels production kicking off, <em>Arrow</em>&#8216;s <strong>Lexa Doig</strong> has joined the cast as well.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-665237\"></span></p>\n<p>Don Mancini broke the news that the <em>Chucky</em> TV series production had begun, stating on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RealDonMancini/status/1377635961115443207?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1377635961115443207%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&#38;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcollider.com%2Fchucky-series-childs-play-series-premiere-date%2F\">social media</a> that &#8220;the series is officially in production and coming to USA Network and SYFY this fall.&#8221; Cast member Devon Sawa confirmed this as well:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Day one for me on this show with the little fella. <a href=\"https://t.co/Tsk4PzCIE6\">pic.twitter.com/Tsk4PzCIE6</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; devon sawa (@DevonESawa) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DevonESawa/status/1377572159187472387?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 1, 2021</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>A continuation of the <em>Child&#8217;s Play</em> series, <em>Chucky</em> kicks off when a &#8220;vintage Chucky doll turns up at a suburban yard sale.&#8221; The result: &#8220;An idyllic American town is thrown into chaos as a series of horrifying murders begin to expose the town’s hypocrisies and secrets. Meanwhile, the arrival of enemies — and allies — from Chucky’s past threatens to expose the truth behind the killings, as well as the demon doll’s untold origins as a seemingly ordinary child who somehow became this notorious monster.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In addition to Sawa, the series brings back Brad Dourif as the voice of Chucky. Dourif&#8217;s daughter <strong>Fiona Dourif</strong>, who appeared in the previous two <em>Chucky</em> movies, is on board as well, as is franchise player<strong> Jennifer Tilly</strong>. New additions to the franchise include <strong>Zackary Arthur</strong> (<em>Transparent</em>), <strong>Teo Briones</strong> (<em>Ratched</em>), <strong>Bjorgvin Arnarson</strong> (<em>PEN15</em>), and <strong>Alyvia Alyn Lind</strong> (<em>The Young and the Restless</em>).

She&#8217;s married to Logan (played by Sawa), and the aunt of Jake Webber (Arthur). She&#8217;s also &#8220;held to an unrealistic standard — by her husband and herself, which leads her to keep a dark secret from her family.&#8221;</p>\n<p><em>Chucky</em> is firmly rooted within the main <em>Child&#8217;s Play</em>/<em>Chucky</em> franchise, which is still going strong. In 2019 there was a <em>Child&#8217;s Play</em> reboot, but that film is completely unconnected from the primary series. Don Mancini, the co-creator of the franchise, has remained a constant presence throughout the entire series, and he&#8217;s on board to write and direct episodes of the TV series as well.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/chucky-tv-series-production/\">&#8216;Chucky&#8217; TV Series Begins Filming, Will Premiere in the Fall</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=AeNEf_SKGPg:108nZR2Q40o:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=AeNEf_SKGPg:108nZR2Q40o:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=AeNEf_SKGPg:108nZR2Q40o:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=AeNEf_SKGPg:108nZR2Q40o:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=AeNEf_SKGPg:108nZR2Q40o:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=AeNEf_SKGPg:108nZR2Q40o:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/AeNEf_SKGPg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 02 Apr 2021 20:30:46 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/chucky-tv-series-production-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"923be3743d86a4b4bec25352a9c999f1","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn36@2020_6/2021/04/03/04-49-04-775_237e1539bc8d8422.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":47231,"destBytes":31964,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/chucky-tv-series-production-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn36@2020_6/2021/04/03/04-49-04-775_237e1539bc8d8422.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=AeNEf_SKGPg:108nZR2Q40o:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn26@2020_1/2021/04/03/04-50-11-271_4b551986c967ff09.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn57@2020_5/2021/04/03/04-50-11-348_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=AeNEf_SKGPg:108nZR2Q40o:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn70@2020_3/2021/04/03/04-50-12-702_220af3799bc27a63.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/AeNEf_SKGPg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn84@2020_6/2021/04/03/04-50-10-479_a6b500b4307e9925.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617425343655},{"createdTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:03","updatedTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:03","title":"You Can Now Watch the Deleted “We Live In a Society” Joker Scene From ‘Zack Snyder’s Justice League’","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=665259","description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/justice-league-we-live-in-a-society-scene.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-665268\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/justice-league-we-live-in-a-society-scene-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"justice league we live in a society scene\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/justice-league-we-live-in-a-society-scene-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/justice-league-we-live-in-a-society-scene-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/justice-league-we-live-in-a-society-scene-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/justice-league-we-live-in-a-society-scene.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Before <strong><em>Zack Snyder&#8217;s Justice League</em> </strong>arrived on HBO Max a trailer dropped featuring <strong>Jared Leto</strong>&#8216;s Joker saying, &#8220;We live in a society!&#8221; It was painfully stupid, and it was clearly meant to &#8220;break the internet&#8221; and drum up more hype, since the Joker saying &#8220;We live in a society&#8221; has become a long-running <a href=\"https://happymag.tv/we-live-in-a-society-meme-explained/\">meme</a> on the internet.

I have some problems with it (which you can read all about <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/zack-snyders-justice-league-review/\">here</a>), but overall, the film is a fascinating experiment and I&#8217;m glad it exists. That said, there&#8217;s one scene in the film that&#8217;s absolutely awful and should&#8217;ve remained cut – the so-called Knightmare sequence, where <strong>Ben Affleck</strong>&#8216;s Batman/Bruce Wayne has a bad dream about an alternate future where Superman is evil and the intergalactic villain Darkseid has taken over the world. It&#8217;s a painfully dull, needless bleak epilogue that ruins a perfectly acceptable, upbeat ending. Making matters worse is a downright craptacular scene between Batman and the Joker, played by Jared Leto. Leto hams it up to the extreme, delivering an edgelord monologue that goes on, and on, and on.</p>\n<p>But believe it or not, as long as this scene is, it could&#8217;ve been even longer! Director Zack Snyder took to social media to upload a longer, uncut version of the scene, and it&#8217;s here where we get to witness Leto say, &#8220;We live in a society!&#8221; Snyder splices the deleted sequence into the officially released scene, which results in a moment where we get to see Affleck and Leto standing in front of a green screen (the actors filmed their moments separately and Snyder cut them together).</p>\n<p>Does adding this back in make the scene better? Absolutely not – it&#8217;s still just as lousy as it was to begin with.

Williamson is a reported big fan of <strong><em>Avatar</em></strong>, and she recently spoke to <em>Avatar</em> grandaddy Cameron on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdhWN-iG3eY&#38;t=2088s\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">The Marianne Williamson Podcast.</a> There, the filmmaker dropped the surprising reveal that he came close to firing his <em>Avatar</em> sequel writers&#8217; room because the team was so focused on new stuff instead of obsessively combing over the things that made the first film such a success.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-665124\"></span></p>\n<p><em>Avatar</em> is the biggest movie of all time, so James Cameron clearly knows a thing or two about a thing or two. Still, when I see him talking about his <em>Avatar</em> sequel writers&#8217; room, I get slightly concerned. During his conversation with Marianne Williamson (via <a href=\"https://www.indiewire.com/2021/04/james-cameron-threatened-fire-avatar-2-writers-1234627393/\">Indiewire</a>), Cameron said: &#8220;When I sat down to write the sequels, I knew there were going to be three at the time and eventually it turned into four, I put together a group of writers and said, ‘I don’t want to hear anybody’s new ideas or anyone’s pitches until we have spent some time figuring out what worked on the first film, what connected, and why it worked.'&#8221;</p>\n<p>I get what the filmmaker is going for here, but is there really some secret formula to explain the <em>Avatar</em> success? Isn&#8217;t it just likely that the film did so well because it featured advanced, cutting-edge technology that generated good word-of-mouth? And that the higher prices for 3D tickets helped inflate the box office haul? That seems to be the most reasonable explanation, but to hear Cameron tell it, there&#8217;s some sort of <em>Da Vinci Code</em>-like secret to <em>Avatar</em>&#8216;s record-breaking box office, and his writers needed to help him boil it down to its base elements.</p>\n<p>Cameron was <em>so</em> serious about this that he even threatened to fire everyone for not following his approach. &#8220;They kept wanting to talk about the new stories. I said, &#8216;We aren’t doing that yet.&#8217; Eventually I had to threaten to fire them all because they were doing what writers do, which is to try and create new stories. I said, ‘We need to understand what the connection was and protect it, protect that ember and that flame.'&#8221;</p>\n<p>Again: Cameron knows more about moviemaking than I do, so who am I to question this logic? And his writers work for him, so he has every right to fire them if he wants. Still, it seems weird that he was so dead-set against even discussing a new story. Cameron continued that he and the writing team sat down and rewatched the first movie together, and broke it down into a three-tier structure: tier one was &#8220;the surface storyline, which is just the plot,&#8221; tier two was &#8220;the spiritualism and the themes of capitalism, imperialism, colonialism, human rights abuses, and nature deficit disorder.&#8221; As for the third tier, that one is a bit more detailed:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;There was a tertiary level as well, and we were all in unison about it, but there was a level that was dreamlike that you could not express in a sentence. It didn’t have any ‘-isms’ to it, it was a dreamlike sense of a yearning to be there, to be in that space, to be in a place that is safe and where you wanted to be. Whether that was flying, that sense of freedom and exhilaration, or whether it’s being in the forest where you can smell the earth. It was a sensory thing that communicated on such a deep level. That was the spirituality of the first film.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>The big question now is: will this approach pay off? I guess we&#8217;ll find out when <em>Avatar 2</em> arrives on <strong>December 16, 2022</strong>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/avatar-sequel-writers-room/\">James Cameron Almost Fired His &#8216;Avatar&#8217; Sequel Writers&#8217; Room</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=HOmTMM1Y_N4:vY37bLMPPIU:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=HOmTMM1Y_N4:vY37bLMPPIU:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=HOmTMM1Y_N4:vY37bLMPPIU:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=HOmTMM1Y_N4:vY37bLMPPIU:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=HOmTMM1Y_N4:vY37bLMPPIU:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=HOmTMM1Y_N4:vY37bLMPPIU:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/HOmTMM1Y_N4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 02 Apr 2021 00:30:23 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Avatar-sequel-writers-room-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"c31f46e7dad47bdc5f02729cc987dbf6","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn40@2020_5/2021/04/03/04-49-12-954_9db75934d33a4b9d.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":60346,"destBytes":43048,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Avatar-sequel-writers-room-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn40@2020_5/2021/04/03/04-49-12-954_9db75934d33a4b9d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=HOmTMM1Y_N4:vY37bLMPPIU:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn59@2020_6/2021/04/03/04-50-10-725_48f20c63a9da4cc4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn57@2020_5/2021/04/03/04-50-11-348_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=HOmTMM1Y_N4:vY37bLMPPIU:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn36@2020_3/2021/04/03/04-50-10-506_c7d5dde5da3d82b5.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/HOmTMM1Y_N4":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn19@2020_1/2021/04/03/04-50-10-682_346b2ee3a45e9e36.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617425343655},{"createdTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:03","updatedTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:03","title":"‘The Falcon and the Winter Soldier’ Team Up With Old Enemies and Lost Allies in “The Power Broker”","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=665167","description":"<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-649832 size-medium\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Falcon-and-the-Winter-Soldier-TB-2-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"Falcon and the Winter Soldier The Power Broker Review\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Falcon-and-the-Winter-Soldier-TB-2.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Falcon-and-the-Winter-Soldier-TB-2-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Hello, and welcome to your weekly recap of <strong><em>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</em></strong>. These are meant to be read after watching, so they will go deep into <strong>spoiler</strong> territory. You have been warned!</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-665167\"></span></p>\n<h2>Previously On…</h2>\n<p>In &#8220;The Star Spangled-Man,&#8221; Sam Wilson (<strong>Anthony Mackie</strong>) and Bucky Barnes (<strong>Sebastian Stan</strong>) fought the Flag Smashers in Munich alongside the new Captain America (<strong>Wyatt Russell)</strong> and Battlestar (<strong>Clé Bennett</strong>), but were unsuccessful in their attempt to recover the stolen Super Soldier Serum. Desperate for leads, Sam and Bucky decide to visit Baron Helmut Zemo (<strong>Daniel Brühl</strong>),the Sokovian Armed Forces Colonel turned terrorist responsible for creating the rift between Tony Stark and Steve Rogers in 2016’s <em>Captain America: Civil War.</em></p>\n<h2>A Message From Our Sponsor</h2>\n<p>Episode 3, &#8220;The Power Broker,&#8221; begins with a message from the Global Repatriation Council that feels a little bit like a prescription drug commercial and a lot like one of those insufferable &#8220;We&#8217;re here for you&#8221; ads you&#8217;ve seen a hundred times during the of COVID-19 pandemic:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;When half of us came back, it was time to rejoice and reunite. The Global Repatriation Council knows that for many it wasn&#8217;t that easy. So much has changed. But we&#8217;re here to help you find your way. Helping you back into your homes and jobs. Helping you navigate changes to society, laws, and borders. Helping you get back to the way things were. GRC, the Global Repatriation Council. Reset. Restore. Rebuild.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Red, White, and Brute</h2>\n<p>Back in Munich, the new Captain America is bustin&#8217; down the door of one of Karli Morgenthau&#8217;s (<strong>Erin Kellyman</strong>) allies, Rudy (<strong>Neal Kodinsky</strong>), the cafe owner seen in last week&#8217;s episode. &#8220;You Americans have become brutes,&#8221; he says, and he&#8217;s not wrong. John F. Walker&#8217;s Captain America is not Steve Rogers. Walker tries to interrogate Neil who refuses to answer his question and instead spits in his face. Walker roughs up the cafe owner and screams, &#8220;Do you know who I am?&#8221; to which the man responds, &#8220;Yes, I do. And I don&#8217;t care.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Outside, Battlestar attempts to reason with Walker. &#8220;Listen, she&#8217;s giving displaced people shelter and medicine,&#8221; he says. &#8220;That kinda thing creates loyalty, man. I know you want this. I get it. But we&#8217;ve literally tried everything we can here. So has Langley, and we keep drawin&#8217; blanks.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Having regained his composure, Walker knows he can&#8217;t do this without the help of some bonafide Avengers. &#8220;So we bet on someone who&#8217;s got a better hand.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>Machiavellian Machinations</h2>\n<p>In Berlin, at the headquarters of the Joint Counter Terrorist Centre, Sam and Bucky prepare to meet Zemo, but Bucky wants to go in alone. &#8220;You&#8217;re an Avenger,&#8221; Bucky says. &#8220;You know how he feels about that.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not like you two were known for frolicking in the sun together,&#8221; Sam replies.</p>\n<p>Bucky confronts Zemo, who&#8217;s in a cell fit for Hannibal Lecter. The terrorist steps out of the shadows and begins reciting the HYDRA code phrase that once controlled the Winter Soldier&#8217;s actions. &#8220;Longing. Rusted. Seventeen&#8230;&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Those days are over,&#8221; assures Bucky.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; laments Zemo. &#8220;I just wanted to see how the new you reacts to the old words.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Bucky tells Zemo that someone has recreated the Super Soldier Serum. &#8220;You are assuming HYDRA has something to do with this, which is why you came to me, which means you are desperate,&#8221; he replies. &#8220;Luckily for you, I know where to begin.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Sam and Bucky need to break Zemo out of jail. They meet in a secluded location where Sam tries to reason with Bucky. &#8220;He blew up the U.N., he killed King T&#8217;Chaka and framed you for it. Did you forget that? You think the Wakandans forgot about it? It&#8217;s a rhetorical question. They didn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Bucky walks Sam through a hypothetical scenario in which they spring Zemo. We&#8217;re taken step-by-step through a very elaborate plan only to discover that it&#8217;s already happened. &#8220;When Steve refused to sign the Sokovia Accords, you backed him,&#8221; says Bucky. &#8220;You broke the law, and you stuck your neck out for me. I&#8217;m asking you to do that again.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Zemo spent years hunting people HYDRA recruited to recreate the serum. &#8220;Because once it&#8217;s out there,&#8221; he warns, &#8220;someone can create an army of people&#8230; like the Avengers.&#8221; Zemo ended the Winter Soldier program once before and has no intention of leaving his work unfinished. To uncover the truth, they&#8217;ll have to scale a ladder of lowlifes. &#8220;First stop is a woman named Selby. Mid-level fence I still have a line on. From there, we climb.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>Welcome to Madripoor</h2>\n<p>Zemo, Sam, and Bucky take the Baron&#8217;s private jet to Madripoor, an island nation in the Indonesian archipelago. Divided between wealthy Hightown and impoverished, crime-ridden Lowtown, Madripoor is a haven for pirates and other criminals. Created by <strong>Chris Claremont</strong> and <strong>Steve Leialoha</strong>, the exotic locale made its Marvel Comics debut in 1985&#8217;s <em>New Mutants #32 </em>and was featured heavily in Claremont&#8217;s <em>Wolverine</em> series.</p>\n<p>During the flight, Zemo lectures Sam and Bucky on the dangers of hero-worship — a little bit of foreshadowing about what may become of John F. Walker&#8217;s Captain America.  He says that the danger with people like America&#8217;s Super Soldiers is that we put them on pedestals. &#8220;They become symbols. Icons. And then we start to forget about their flaws. From there, cities fly, innocent people die. Movements are formed, wars are fought.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Zemo, Bucky, and Sam — posing as an African rake named Conrad Mack, AKA the Smiling Tiger — make their way into the depths of Madripoor to meet Selby (<strong>Imelda Corcoran</strong>). Conrad Mack, by the way, was first introduced in 1992&#8217;s <em>New Warriors #19</em> as a mute feral being covered in orange fur and sharp claws. The offer is simple: Selby tells Zemo everything she knows about the Super Soldier Serum and she gets the Winter Soldier in return, along with the code words to control him, of course.</p>\n<p>As it turns out, the serum is in Madripoor, being developed by Dr. Wilfred Nagel (<strong>Olli Haaskivi</strong>) a character that first appeared in the 2003 series <em>Truth: Red, White &#38; Black </em>alongside Isaiah Bradley, the Black Captain America. Before the gang can get more information on Nagel&#8217;s location, the deal goes south and Selby is shot by Sharon Carter (<strong>Emily VanCamp</strong>). An enemy of the state, the great-niece of S.H.I.E.L.D. founder Peggy Carter has been hiding out on Madripoor, as the island nation doesn&#8217;t allow criminal extradition from within its borders.</p>\n<p>Carter isn&#8217;t ready to play Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. again, however. &#8220;You know the whole hero thing is a joke, right? The way you gave up that shield, deep down, you must know it&#8217;s all hypocrisy.&#8221; When Bucky tries to interject, she scoffs, &#8220;Please. You buy into all that stars and stripes bullshit. Before you were his pet psychopath [pointing to Zemo], you were Mr. America! Cap&#8217;s best friend.&#8221;</p>\n<p>To quote Bucky, &#8220;Wow, she&#8217;s kind of awful now.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Sam makes a deal with Sharon. She helps them find Nagel and he&#8217;ll get her name cleared. Sharon, who is something of a hustler and art dealer, throws a party for her well-connected clients, leading to a pretty hilarious scene of Zemo cutting loose on the dance floor. During all the fun and frivolity, Sharon gets a lead on Nagel&#8217;s whereabouts and we&#8217;re off to the docks, where the gang uses a hidden doorway in an empty storage container to gain access to the scientist&#8217;s secret lab.</p>\n<p>As they begin to question Nagel, bounty hunters converge on the docks, leaving Sharon Carter to whip some serious ass. Back in the lab, we get a megalomaniacal monologue from Nagel that explains everything:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I was brought into HYDRA&#8217;s Winter Soldier program to pick up their work after the five failed test subjects in Siberia. When HYDRA fell, I was recruited by the CIA. They had blood samples from an American test subject with semi-stable traces of serum in his system. After much labor, I was able to isolate the necessary compounds in his blood. I was a god. I did what no other scientist since Erskine was able to do. But mine was going to be different. No clunky machines or jacked-up bodies. Mine was going to be subtle, optimized, perfect.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Using Isaiah Bradley&#8217;s blood, Nagel was able to recreate the serum. Before he was able to complete his work, however, he turned to dust during the Blip. When he returned five years later, the program had been abandoned, so he came to Madripoor. The mysterious Power Broker was more than happy to fund the continuation of his work. 20 vials were made, now in the possession of Karli Morgenthau. Once all the useful information is extracted from Nagel, Zemo shoots him dead. Way harsh, Helmut.</p>\n<h2>Wrappin&#8217; It Up</h2>\n<p>In Vilnius, Lithuania, we catch up with Karli and Dovich (<strong>Desmond Chiam</strong>) outside a GRC Supply Depot. The Global Repatriation Council has six months&#8217; worth of supplies sitting around collecting dust, so the Flag Smashers are stealing them and distributing them to the people who need them most.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, in Berlin, Captain America and Battlestar are connecting the dots. Walker knows that Sam and Bucky broke Zemo out of prison, but as Battlestar points out, they can&#8217;t accuse them of something without evidence. &#8220;Which is why you and I are just gonna run with this one for a minute,&#8221; says Walker.</p>\n<p>Battlestar replies, &#8220;So I take what happens next isn&#8217;t a strictly on-the-books type thing, is it?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Lemar,&#8221; Walker begins, &#8220;If we get the job done, you think they&#8217;re gonna sweat us on the how?&#8221;</p>\n<p>Zemo, Bucky, and Sam, meanwhile, make their way to Riga, Latvia, to search for Karli. Before they can get down to business, Bucky has a run-in with Ayo (<strong>Florence Kasumba</strong>), a member of the Dora Milaje — the personal bodyguards and royal security of the Black Panther. The warrior has only one thing to say. &#8220;I&#8217;m here for Zemo.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\n<p>&#8220;The Power Broker&#8221; is another strong episode of the Disney+ limited series created by <strong>Malcolm Spellman</strong> and directed by <strong>Kari Skogland</strong>. Mackie and Stan&#8217;s chemistry continues to be the selling point of the series, while it&#8217;s super-fun to see returning characters like Sharon Carter and Baron Zemo re-framed by the events of <em>Avengers: Infinity War</em> and <em>Avengers: Endgame</em>. They&#8217;re not in the same shape we left them in &#8211; they continue to develop alongside the major characters of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which is nice to see. As for John F. Walker&#8217;s Captain America, I fully expect him to <span class=\"css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0\">get absolutely JUICED on some Super Soldier Serum and have a Battfleck-level </span><span class=\"css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-b88u0q r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0\">roid</span><span class=\"css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0\"> rage episode where his mean streak is exposed to the world.</span></p>\n<p>For me, the real highlight of this episode is the introduction of Madripoor as yet another extremely cool locale for our heroes to explore. It&#8217;s the Mos Eisley Cantina of the Marvel Cinematic Universe — a wretched hive of scum and villainy that I can&#8217;t wait to see more of. It&#8217;s also a key location from the X-Men universe, which already has my gears spinning on how the MCU will bring Xavier&#8217;s mutants into the fold.</p>\n<p>What did you think of this week&#8217;s episode? Who is the mysterious Power Broker? Will we see Isaiah Bradley again? Will John F. Walker finally snap? And what will Ayo do when she gets her hands on Zemo? Join me next week for an in-depth breakdown of the latest episode!</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/falcon-and-the-winter-soldier-the-power-broker-review/\">&#8216;The Falcon and the Winter Soldier’ Team Up With Old Enemies and Lost Allies in &#8220;The Power Broker&#8221;</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=MXDoThst6Kk:z6SjMcdWvag:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=MXDoThst6Kk:z6SjMcdWvag:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=MXDoThst6Kk:z6SjMcdWvag:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=MXDoThst6Kk:z6SjMcdWvag:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=MXDoThst6Kk:z6SjMcdWvag:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=MXDoThst6Kk:z6SjMcdWvag:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/MXDoThst6Kk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 02 Apr 2021 14:00:10 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Falcon-and-the-Winter-Soldier-TB-2-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"58f856b7a49f68c70f5c230a9196eb33","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn5@2020_1/2021/04/03/04-49-04-769_a270f9a319d67090.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":35187,"destBytes":22356,"author":"Adam Frazier","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Falcon-and-the-Winter-Soldier-TB-2-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn5@2020_1/2021/04/03/04-49-04-769_a270f9a319d67090.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=MXDoThst6Kk:z6SjMcdWvag:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn46@2020_1/2021/04/03/04-50-10-954_85637e9ebb0c497a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn57@2020_5/2021/04/03/04-50-11-348_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=MXDoThst6Kk:z6SjMcdWvag:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn15@2020_4/2021/04/03/04-50-10-636_aef8c5416590b1d8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/MXDoThst6Kk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn29@2020_3/2021/04/03/04-50-10-942_a5744c28f5e0134e.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617425343655},{"createdTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:03","updatedTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:03","title":"‘What We Do in the Shadows’ Season 3 Teases a Returning Character and New Jackie Daytona-Inspired Directions","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=664816","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-619133 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/what-we-do-in-the-shadows-season-3-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"What We Do in the Shadows Season 3\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/what-we-do-in-the-shadows-season-3-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/what-we-do-in-the-shadows-season-3-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/what-we-do-in-the-shadows-season-3-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/what-we-do-in-the-shadows-season-3.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s been far too long since we&#8217;ve spent time with our new favorite vampires in FX&#8217;s mockumentary series <strong><em>What We Do in the Shadows</em></strong>.

With two seasons under its belt, the <em>What We Do in the Shadows</em> TV series has proven it&#8217;s every bit as good as the original movie, and it&#8217;s expanded the mythology of the series in an entertaining and creative way.

We&#8217;ve already heard that the third season will bring new creatures like <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/what-we-do-in-the-shadows-season-3-comic-con-2020-panel/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">gargoyles and hellhounds into the fray</a>, but showrunner/executive producer <strong>Paul Simms</strong> and executive producer <strong>Stefani Robinson</strong> teased a returning character.</p>\n<p>Series regulars Nandor the Relentless (<strong>Kayvan Novak</strong>), his Familiar-turned-vampire-hunter Guillermo de la Cruz (<strong>Harvey Guillén</strong>), fellow vampires Laszlo Cravensworth (<strong>Matt Berry</strong>) and his lover Nadja (<strong>Natasia Demetriou</strong>), and energy vampire Colin Robinson (<strong>Mark Proksch</strong>) are all coming back. But Simms says they&#8217;ll be joined by a returning character who will be involved in a season-long arc. The showrunner only went so far as to say it&#8217;s <em>not</em> Nick Kroll as Simon the Devious, but it will be &#8220;someone we all know and love.&#8221;</p>\n<p>My initial hope was that we might see Jemaine Clement returning to <em>What We Do in the Shadows</em> in a major capacity. It doesn&#8217;t seem like he&#8217;s super busy with anything else right now, and bringing him into the show would be a lot of fun. He previously appeared as part of the Vampiric Council along with Taika Waititi and Jonathan Brugh as <em>What We Do in the Shadows</em> movie characters Viago von Dorna Schmarten Scheden Heimburg and Deacon Brucke, and it would make sense if he had to check in with the Staten Island bloodsuckers after the events of the second season. It could just as easily be Brugh stopping in too, but it&#8217;s unlikely to be Waititi since he&#8217;s very busy in production on <em>Thor: Love &#38; Thunder</em> and will be working on that movie for awhile.</p>\n<p>However, another potentially more interesting guess that would help expand the show&#8217;s narrative would be the return of Beanie Feldstein as Jenna, a college LARPer who was initially lured to the vampire clan by Guillermo as a delicious virgin feast. But in the first season, Jenna ended up being transformed into a vampire by Nadja after she saw the young girl wasn&#8217;t treated so well by her fellow students. Jenna was even learning how to hone her skills as a vampire, discovering she had the ability to become invisible. But we haven&#8217;t seen Jenna in quite some time, mostly <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/what-we-do-in-the-shadows-season-2-guest-stars/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">because of Feldstein&#8217;s movie schedule</a>, and bringing her back has a lot of potential. Maybe she&#8217;s even been around the whole time, just standing around being invisible.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, there&#8217;s one character who we probably won&#8217;t see making a comeback anytime soon. Even though fans loved the second season debut of Jackie Daytona, a separate human character who definitely isn&#8217;t a disguise donned by vampire Laszlo Cravensworth, Simms and Robinson won&#8217;t be going back to that well anytime soon. But it did give them the confidence to take the show in even more surprising new directions. Robinson said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;That episode gave us the opportunity to break format with all of the characters and push the show into new settings, formats, characters to explore what we’ve established. So not another Jackie Daytona adventure, but we have plans for the show to go into completely different directions.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Simms and Robinson weren&#8217;t ready to reveal what those directions might be, but you can bet we&#8217;ll be ready when the time comes. Sadly, we&#8217;ll be waiting a long time before we get the third season. Production was intended to begin last month, but due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, production won&#8217;t begin until sometime later this year, which means we probably won&#8217;t see the show return until late in 2021 and possibly not until early 2022.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/what-we-do-in-the-shadows-season-3-hints/\">&#8216;What We Do in the Shadows&#8217; Season 3 Teases a Returning Character and New Jackie Daytona-Inspired Directions</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=P8nfiSORMew:40eZnq7Ssro:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=P8nfiSORMew:40eZnq7Ssro:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=P8nfiSORMew:40eZnq7Ssro:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=P8nfiSORMew:40eZnq7Ssro:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=P8nfiSORMew:40eZnq7Ssro:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=P8nfiSORMew:40eZnq7Ssro:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/P8nfiSORMew\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 02 Apr 2021 22:00:57 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/what-we-do-in-the-shadows-season-3-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"e291130376c9dd4ad68570f94b1486df","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn27@2020_2/2021/04/03/04-49-05-517_7e986b52dda9de3d.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":38684,"destBytes":24508,"author":"Ethan Anderton","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/what-we-do-in-the-shadows-season-3-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn27@2020_2/2021/04/03/04-49-05-517_7e986b52dda9de3d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=P8nfiSORMew:40eZnq7Ssro:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn62@2020_3/2021/04/03/04-50-10-990_5632be515b50b68b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn57@2020_5/2021/04/03/04-50-11-348_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=P8nfiSORMew:40eZnq7Ssro:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn3@2020_3/2021/04/03/04-50-10-691_aa1c17cd0da5f1e5.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/P8nfiSORMew":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn96@2020_5/2021/04/03/04-50-10-562_503de3262396c875.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617425343646},{"createdTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:03","updatedTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:03","title":"‘Black Panther 2’ Director Ryan Coogler Says Chadwick Boseman “Wouldn’t Have Wanted Us To Stop”","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=664846","description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/black-panther-2-update.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-664870\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/black-panther-2-update-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"black panther 2 update\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/black-panther-2-update-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/black-panther-2-update-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/black-panther-2-update-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/black-panther-2-update.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>Chadwick Boseman</strong>&#8216;s death last summer caught almost everyone off-guard as the actor had kept his colon cancer diagnosis private. And <strong>Ryan Coogler</strong>, who directed Boseman in <em>Black Panther</em>, was one of the many people surprised by Boseman&#8217;s death, as he had already been working on the script for <strong><em>Black Panther 2</em></strong> for Boseman to star in. Following Boseman&#8217;s passing, there was some question as to how the film series could even continue. Eventually, everyone decided to move forward with altered plans – <em>Black Panther 2</em> would happen, but rather than recast Boseman&#8217;s now-iconic role of T&#8217;Challa, Coogler would re-work his script. In a recent interview, Coogler adds that moving forward would&#8217;ve been exactly what Boseman would&#8217;ve wanted.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-664846\"></span></p>\n<p>The quote from Ryan Coogler about <em>Black Panther 2</em> comes from <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/judas-and-the-black-messiahs-all-black-team-on-bittersweet-feeling-of-making-oscar-history\">THR</a>, where the filmmaker opened up a bit about having to continue on with the film in the wake of Chadwick Boseman&#8217;s unexpected death. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know what was going on,&#8221; Coogler said in regards to Boseman&#8217;s illness. &#8220;I knew what he wanted me to know. I miss him in every way that you could miss somebody, as a friend, as a collaborator. And it sucks because I love watching movies, and I don&#8217;t get to watch the next thing he would have made. So it&#8217;s grief on a lot of levels, but then, it&#8217;s a deep sense of gratitude because I can close my eyes and hear his voice.&#8221;</p>\n<p>After Boseman&#8217;s death many wondered how, exactly, <em>Black Panther 2</em> would continue. Would Coogler and Marvel recast the lead role? The answer turned out to be no – rather than bring in a new actor to play T&#8217;Challa, Coogler is instead reworking the script. It&#8217;s not entirely clear how this will all work out – the most popular assumption is that the film will shift focus to <strong>Letitia Wright</strong> as T&#8217;Challa&#8217;s sister Shuri, but that&#8217;s just speculation for the time being.</p>\n<p>However things pan out, Coogler made it clear that giving up in the wake of Boseman&#8217;s death was not an option. &#8220;You’ve got to keep going when you lose loved ones. I know Chad wouldn’t have wanted us to stop,&#8221; the director said. &#8220;He was somebody who was so about the collective. <em>Black Panther</em>, that was his movie. He was hired to play that role before anybody else was even thought of, before I was hired, before any of the actresses were hired. On that set, he was all about everybody else. Even though he was going through what he was going through, he was checking in on them, making sure they were good. If we cut his coverage, he would stick around and read lines off-camera [to help other actors with their performances]. So it would be harder for me to stop. Truthfully. I&#8217;d feel him yelling at me, like, &#8216;What are you doing?&#8217; So you keep going.&#8221;</p>\n<p><em>Black Panther 2</em> is currently set to open on <strong>July 22, 2022</strong>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/black-panther-2-update/\">&#8216;Black Panther 2&#8217; Director Ryan Coogler Says Chadwick Boseman &#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t Have Wanted Us To Stop&#8221;</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=v-3CIf6LeFs:T20-Hv6dMKs:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=v-3CIf6LeFs:T20-Hv6dMKs:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=v-3CIf6LeFs:T20-Hv6dMKs:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=v-3CIf6LeFs:T20-Hv6dMKs:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=v-3CIf6LeFs:T20-Hv6dMKs:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=v-3CIf6LeFs:T20-Hv6dMKs:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/v-3CIf6LeFs\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 02 Apr 2021 21:00:41 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/black-panther-2-update-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"2fa470b3e6af03c4d93f4835cf4dc591","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn33@2020_3/2021/04/03/04-49-14-951_e123ff6c18008e08.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":37163,"destBytes":23712,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/black-panther-2-update-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn33@2020_3/2021/04/03/04-49-14-951_e123ff6c18008e08.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=v-3CIf6LeFs:T20-Hv6dMKs:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn64@2020_4/2021/04/03/04-50-11-759_13473d6c765d0d03.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn57@2020_5/2021/04/03/04-50-11-348_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=v-3CIf6LeFs:T20-Hv6dMKs:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn65@2020_5/2021/04/03/04-50-11-080_7313c1e2f35a4efa.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/v-3CIf6LeFs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn67@2020_6/2021/04/03/04-50-10-541_244fef698f3b4a1d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617425343655},{"createdTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:03","updatedTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:03","title":"‘Us Again’ Clip: Get a Taste of Disney’s Theatrical Short Attached to ‘Raya and the Last Dragon’","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=665208","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-665216 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/usagain-couple-dancing-nyc-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"Us Again Clip\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/usagain-couple-dancing-nyc.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/usagain-couple-dancing-nyc-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>On top of missing the theatrical movie-going experience altogether over the past year, it&#8217;s been a bummer to miss out on Disney&#8217;s tradition of including animated short films before their big screen releases. Thankfully, the short film attached to the theatrical release of <strong><em>Raya and the Last Dragon</em></strong> is coming home with the movie&#8217;s digital release today.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Us Again</em></strong> is written and directed by <strong>Zach Parrish</strong>, who served as head of animation on <em>Big Hero 6</em> and will be at the helm of an animated <em>Short Circuit</em> movie at Disney. The film follows an elderly couple as they joyously rekindle their youth through the magic of dancing, and a little <em>Us Again</em> clip gives us a taste of the fancy footwork that will take us through the city.<span id=\"more-665208\"></span></p>\n<h2>Us Again Clip</h2>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1n-gCLoBSTU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<blockquote><p>Set in a vibrant city pulsating with rhythm and movement, an elderly man and his young-at-heart wife rekindle their youthful passion for life and each other on one magical night. The years fade away as the joy of dancing propels them across the exciting cityscape of their youth and revives fond memories and ambitions.</p></blockquote>\n<p>If they used the characters from Pixar&#8217;s <em>Up</em>, then they could have called this movie <em>Up Again</em>. (It&#8217;s okay, I&#8217;ll see myself out).</p>\n<p>Anyway, this clip is so vibrant and full of life, and the animation looks phenomenal too. The rain-soaked city looks beautiful at night, and the dance moves are crisp and clean as a lively score pulses in the background. There&#8217;s plenty more dancing to behold too, with horeographers/dancers <strong>Keone &#38; Mari Madrid</strong> (champions of the dance competition series <em>World of Dance</em>) providing the moves for this short film. The score comes from <em>Captain Marvel</em> composer <strong>Pinar Toprak</strong>.</p>\n<p>The only way to see <em>Us Again</em> previously was if you saw <em>Raya and the Last Dragon</em> in theaters. But when you pick up the movie on home video (including <span class=\"ILfuVd NA6bn\"><span class=\"hgKElc\">4K Ultra HD, Blu-ray and DVD on May 18)</span></span>, it will be included as a special feature.
