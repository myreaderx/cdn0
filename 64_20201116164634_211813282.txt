The Google Home Phone is a fusion of the Google Home smart-speaker (now the Nest Audio smart-speaker) and the Google Pixel), but its spiritual ancestor is, in fact, the landline phone. Designed to be a smart device with a dockable receiver or &#8216;phone&#8217;, the Google Home Phone lets the elderly connect with their relatives and friends who are also a part of the Google ecosystem. Once set up, the Home Phone works like a smart speaker, allowing you to ask for help, access information, or contact people, while the detachable &#8216;handset&#8217; functions as the receiver on a landline, allowing you to lift it off the base and talk to people, not just using audio, but using video too!</p>\n<p>The Home Phone is an incredibly interesting concept for a whole bunch of reasons. For starters, Barnes envisions it as a &#8220;better&#8221;, smarter, and wireless version of a landline, allowing you to contact people without remembering phone numbers, see who&#8217;s calling (via Google&#8217;s contact database), be unencumbered by coiled wires, and easily avoid robocalls (thanks to Google&#8217;s incredible spam-detection AI). The touchscreen display on the detachable unit serves as a visual aid, allowing the elderly to tap icons without navigating confusing interfaces&#8230; and accessibility features like adjustable font-sizes make it easy for people with visual impairment.</p>\n<p>Personally, the Google Home Phone gets a bunch of things right with its form factor. Not only is the dockable receiver + base interaction very reminiscent of the landline telephone (in fact the receiver can be held to one&#8217;s ear like a conventional phone too), but its circular &#8216;phone&#8217; also ticks two arguably important boxes. The circular form-factor is rather comfortable to hold in any angle (a great win for people with dexterity issues), but at the same time, dock it onto its base and it also resembles a magical crystal ball, which believe it or not, is a familiar silhouette that also cleverly ties into the magical ability for the circular screen to really display anything, from faces of loved ones, to the time, weather, messages, and even Map routes!</p>\n<p>Barnes even fleshed out the Home Phone concept to make sure it&#8217;s a practical systems solution (and not just a pretty concept). The base sports a wired connection (so you never have to worry about batteries), and features a powerful smart-speaker that&#8217;s easy to talk to. The dockable &#8216;phone&#8217; sits loosely on top of the base, with &#8216;no fixed docking position&#8217;, which means the elderly never have to worry about making sure they&#8217;ve placed the receiver the right way. As soon as the phone and hub are in proximity, the hub begins wirelessly charging the phone. The phone-unit also comes with a notch of its own, featuring a powerful camera system that enables two-way video communication. Not only does it mean the elderly can have video conferences with their friends, family, caretakers, and medical staff, it also enables the latter to keep a watchful eye on their elderly wards by allowing the Google Home Phone to function as a home-camera.</p>\n<p>Designer: Chris Barnes</p>\n<p><img

supplements","link":"https://www.yankodesign.com/?p=286796","description":"<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-287332\"

alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></p>\n<p>Back in 2018, Joop Opmeer, the young inventor behind the YOS <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/tag/water-bottle/\">bottle</a>, noticed how his mother would forget to take her <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/tag/pill-box/\">medications</a> on time, sometimes skipping an entire day. It&#8217;s a task that&#8217;s easy to forget, but one that can have serious health consequences depending on the necessity of that medication. However, Joop’s mother isn’t the only one making these mistakes. In his home country, The Netherlands, 68% of people who take daily supplements or medication forget at least once a month. To make their lives slightly more convenient, Joop designed a portable pillbox that someone would be less likely to forget. This was the inspiration for the YOS bottle.</p>\n<p>YOS, which stands for Your Organized Supplements, is a reusable water bottle with a detachable pill holder. The bottle holds 375ml and the pillbox has seven compartments (labeled for each day of the week). Although, if the containers are too small, YOS offers a larger, 4-compartment box as an alternative. The bottles also come in four vibrant colors, so you’ll want to take it everywhere you go. They are also dishwasher safe, which adds to their convenience.</p>\n<p>The YOS is more than a clever, functional product. The company itself has a mission that buyers will feel good about supporting. First, YOS products are made with recyclable materials, helping to reduce waste and promote sustainability.  Second, a portion of their sales goes to a research foundation for pancreatic cancer research. So, in addition to getting a useful product, you are also supporting a business that helps its community.</p>\n<p>Personally, as a younger person who doesn’t take daily medication, I still think this product would be useful in my life. For instance, refillable water bottles have grown more popular as more people decide to reduce their environmental footprint, especially within my age demographic. Also, I frequently hike and take boxing classes, and I may need an Advil if I overexert myself. Or, more likely, I would use the pillbox as a snack compartment, especially for trail mix. So, you can see that although the YOS bottle caters specifically to individuals who take supplements, its appeal is universal. After all, we all need water to survive.</p>\n<p>Designer: Joop Opmeer</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.yosbottle.nl/shop/#!\">Click Here to Buy Now!</a></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full

design should be according to him. &#8220;Innovative&#8221;, he said, &#8220;It is not about making something bigger, better, stronger, faster, cheaper, etc. than your previous product or service. Innovation is about creating something that makes what you already have obsolete. And that&#8217;s why I love concepts so much &#8211; they always push the boundaries.&#8221; And that same love for concepts echoes through all of Yanko Design.</p>\n<p>This year, the COVID-19 pandemic has surged through the world, changing things as we know it. But one thing that could not be dampened was the sense of enthusiasm with which the design community rose up to this new challenge. Red Dot Awards are not just an award, but a seal of quality that helps the designers distinguish their design and gain a spotlight to help their talent shine. Undeterred by COVID, the Red Dot Award ceremony was held online this year, the celebratory moments captured and shared during a two-day award celebration.

(Japan) is the winner of the Red Dot: Luminary 2020 award for their innovative, motor-powered design that helps above-knee amputees restore their physical functions. As Mr. Kazuo Tanaka explains “The Robotic Prosthetic Knee completely changes the concept of prostheses up to now. It is the fusion of body neural information and robot technology. As a result, the user can obtain a natural walking sensation that is completely different from that of a conventional artificial leg. What&#8217;s more, its appearance is fashionable and gives the user confidence.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3oizum1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/11/robotic-prosthetic-knee-sweeps-the-luminary-at-the-red-dot-design-award-design-concept-2020/red_dot_award_design_concept_best_of_best_2020_01.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-287548\" /></a></p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Robotic Prosthetic Knee by BionicM Inc.</h4>\n<p>The top accolade winning design serves as an inspiration to designers and takes a huge step towards building a more inclusive world. How do they do that? By merging robotic technology and the human body! The design is very personal for its CEO, Dr. Sun Xiajun since he is a prosthetic user since age 9. While he got his first prosthetic at the age of 15, Dr. Xiajun understands the importance of merging design and engineering to create a product that excels in everyday life. Especially in the prosthetics field, functionality and aesthetics hold equal weightage in making the design feel socially acceptable, helping the user be comfortable in using this design to improve their day-to-day life. The result is a compact, lightweight, and futuristic design that the user is actually proud to show-off instead of hiding it.</p>\n<p>Yanko Design curates the team&#8217;s favorite designs that are pushing the boundaries for a better tomorrow and it ranges from urban architecture and automotive to smart home appliances and toys!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3oizum1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-283615\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/10/red-dot/02-emergency_deployable_shelter.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3oizum1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-283614\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/10/red-dot/01-emergency_deployable_shelter.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3oizum1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-283626\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/10/red-dot/03-emergency_deployable_shelter.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></a></p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Deployable Emergency Shelter by Samuel Barratt and Henry Glogau</h4>\n<p>This design has an intrinsic connection to its environment and stands on the pillars of biomimicry and symbiosis. The concept explores how snow can be used as a natural insulator and protective layer in extremely cold environments through fractional origami skin combined with lightweight lattice structure &#8211; think Eskimos but in 2020 with design skills and their traditional knowledge of snow. &#8220;We wanted to design a shelter which looks to embrace and utilize these extreme conditions to its advantage, rather than fight against them. Snow became a building material rather than a burden,” said the designers of the Deployable Emergency Shelter.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3oizum1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-283620\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/10/red-dot/01-unlimited.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3oizum1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-283621\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/10/red-dot/02-unlimited.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></a></p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">UN/LIMITED by Chou Kuan-hua</h4>\n<p>UN/LIMITED explores the requirements of volume and material through a daily backpack because we don&#8217;t have Hermoine&#8217;s Undetectable Extension Charm to fit everything in our regular bags. It is expandable to accommodate unexpected items and can also be compressed into a more streamlined form to allow for better mobility. Guided by the design philosophy of &#8216;design by reduction&#8217;, it is sealed by heat welding and made of a mono-material, DuPont Hytrel, or similar recyclable thermoplastic elastomers with different levels of hardness and also making it easier to recycle &#8211; the objective is to design a product with recyclable plastic that is sustainable, improves with age and has a genuine bond with the user.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3oizum1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-283623\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/10/red-dot/01-togother.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3oizum1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-283625\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/10/red-dot/03-togother.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3oizum1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-283714\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/10/red-dot/Red-Dot-2020-Design-Concept_Award-winner_TOGOther.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></a></p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">TOGOther by Pan Yu-Ting and Wu Ya-Cheng</h4>\n<p>This is an electric transporter that can be attached to all kinds of wheelchairs giving mobility a dimension of modularity that makes it more adaptable to people and places. Depending on the needs of the disabled, it offers three mobility modes: Independent Mode, Assisted Mode, and Personal Transporter mode. The modern aesthetics and universal design details help move away from the stigma of disability. This challenges our long-standing stereotypes and perceptions of assistive devices. Rooted in the idea of an inclusive mobile society for everyone, TOGOther aims to lighten the load of both the disabled and their caregiver, thereby supporting an aging society.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3oizum1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/11/robotic-prosthetic-knee-sweeps-the-luminary-at-the-red-dot-design-award-design-concept-2020/red_dot_award_design_concept_best_of_best_2020_02.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"1050\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-287550\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3oizum1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/11/robotic-prosthetic-knee-sweeps-the-luminary-at-the-red-dot-design-award-design-concept-2020/red_dot_award_design_concept_best_of_best_2020_03.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-287551\" /></a></p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Ultra-Thin Air Conditioner by Ningbo AUX Electric Co., Ltd.</h4>\n<p>Tired of the bulky split Air Conditioners or the rattle-y window ACs? This is your solution &#8211; a slim, telescopic air-conditioner with an accordion-like panel as a cool air outlet. Ultra-Thin Air Conditioner&#8217;s panel expands and contracts to change the angle of the airflow that is exiting. The more the panels expand, the bigger the area of airflow. This accordion design replaces the traditional swing-flap blades of air-conditioners that usually guide the airflow. In a standby state, the space of the air duct is compressed, the panel collapses and closes, hiding the air vents to leave behind an ‘ultra-thin’ form. Sleep, simple, and super &#8216;cool&#8217;.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3oizum1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-283631\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/10/red-dot/01-poseiden.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3oizum1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-283632\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/10/red-dot/02-poseiden.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></a></p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">POSEIDON by PSD Pte. Ltd.</h4>\n<p>This automotive design is a first of its kind product that enables divers to reach deeper depths with great speeds by equipping them with the environmental parameters from an integrated LCD screen. The unique built-in GPS positioning system helps users return to their set locations when the propeller goes into in low-battery mode. For user-friendly ‘smart return’ function the slots are filled with a hollow glass micro-bead type of buoyant material &#8211; this ensures that the body is not affected by the high pressure of the deep waters and that it would actually float to the surface and start the GPS positioning function after being let go. In order to create highly efficient products with perfect safety, A123 lithium-ion batteries are used because they offer no risk of explosion, therefore reducing stress for divers. Truly, the Poseidon of the automotive world with its amphibian-like design.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3oizum1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-283634\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/10/red-dot/01-ambi.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3oizum1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-283637\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/10/red-dot/02-ambi-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"1050\" /></a></p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">AMBI- by Baek Ju Yeon</h4>\n<p>A regular mouse is still a major cause for ‘carpal tunnel syndrome’ because a mouse&#8217;s angle is generally not ergonomic for the hand, especially if you are left-handed because the mouse market often forgets about you. Sandwiched between the shell of the vertical AMBI- mouse is a collapsible accordion-like structure made with flexible plastic that allows users to adjust the tilt angle of the mouse. When the structure changes, a setup window will intuitively appear on the screen. This can be modified to fit both hands. The upper and lower shell can also be used alone (by detaching the accordion structure) just like a regular mouse. Left-handers finally rejoice!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3oizum1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-283639\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/10/red-dot/01-WM_fresher.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3oizum1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-283640\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/10/red-dot/02-WM_fresher.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3oizum1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-283641\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/10/red-dot/03-WM_fresher.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></a></p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">WM Fresher by Nanjing Chuangwei Household Electronic Appliances Limited</h4>\n<p>By combining the functions of a front-loading washing machine, a small top-loading washing machine, and a shoe-care machine, WM Fresher offers users a ‘head-to-toe’ clean. Its unique three-layer washing space can wash and care for different clothing materials and dirtiness at the same time, saving time and energy. It is user-friendly, even for the elderly, and it is possible to customize and personalize the washing parameters for the optimum cleaning result. It uses an innovative steam washing function to sterilize and disinfect clothes. The shoe sterilization area is right at the bottom and automatically detects, sterilizes, and deodorizes footwear according to the material and size.

Cities around the world are seeing a gradual decrease in personal living space, and the increasing movement in and out of the city. People need furniture that is suited for small spaces and frequent moves. Moving Z is a new furniture concept that is compact and easy to move. It is designed to reduce the time and effort needed when moving to a new home. For frequent movers, Moving Z can be easily packed, assembled, or used in different configurations – pushed down or upright to fit any space. The modular boxes are made from a variety of materials and can be stacked/arranged freely while the wheeled frame functions as a cart which can be used to move things conveniently.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3oizum1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-283644\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/10/red-dot/01-little_hoppa.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3oizum1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-283646\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/10/red-dot/03-little_hoppa.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3oizum1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-283645\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/10/red-dot/02-little_hoppa.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></a></p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Little Hoppa by Sofie</h4>\n<p>Many children’s toys on the market are bulky, not designed to last, and non-renewable. Little Hoppa is a 3-in-1 children’s play gym, jumper, and activity table. This durable, innovative, and multi-activity toy transforms and adapts with children as they grow (from birth to 4 years old). It is easy to clean and recycle, the simple nut-and-bolt fit makes it super simple to put each stage together; most parts are also reused in each stage.
