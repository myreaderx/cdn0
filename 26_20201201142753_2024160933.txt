Today, however, a startup helping SMBs get online is announcing some significant funding &#8212; a sign of how things are changing at a moment when many businesses have realised that being online is no longer an option, but a necessity.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://gosite.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GoSite</a>, a San Diego-based startup that helps small and medium enterprises build websites, and, with a minimum amount of technical know-how, run other functions of their businesses online &#8212; like payments, online marketing, appointment booking and accounting &#8212; has picked up $40 million in funding.</p>\n<p>GoSite offers a one-stop shop for users to build and manage everything online, <span style=\"letter-spacing: -0.1px; font-size: 1.125rem;\">with the ability to feed in up to 80 different third-party services within that. </span>&#8220;We want to help our customers be found everywhere,&#8221; said Alex Goode, the founder and CEO of GoSite. &#8220;We integrate with Facebook and other consumer platforms like Siri, Apple Maps, and search engines like Google, Yahoo and Bing and more.&#8221; It also builds certain features like payments from the ground up.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>The Series B comes on the back of a strong year for the company. Driven by Covid-19 circumstances, businesses have increasingly turned to the internet to interact with customers, and GoSite &#8212; which has &#8220;thousands&#8221; of SMB customers &#8212; said it doubled its customer base in 2020.</p>\n<p>This latest round is being led by Left Lane Capital out of New York, with Longley Capital, Cove Fund, Stage 2, Ankona Capital and Serra Ventures also participating. GoSite is clearly striking while the iron is hot: Longley, also based out of San Diego, led the company&#8217;s previous round, which was only in <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/gosite-closes-16m-series-a-investment-round-adds-key-hires-to-fuel-growth-301108478.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">August of this year</a>. It has now raised $60 million to date.</p>\n<p>GoSite is, in a sense, a play for more inclusivity in tech: its customers are not companies that it&#8217;s &#8220;winning&#8221; off other providers that provide website building and hosting and other services typically used by SMBs, such as Squarespace and Wix, or GoDaddy, or Shopify.</p>\n<p>Rather, they are companies that may have never used any of these: local garages, local landscapers, local hair salons, local accountancy firms, local dentists and so on. Barring the accounting firm, these are not businesses that will ever go fully online, as a retailer might, not least because of the physical aspect of each of those professions. But they will need an online presence and the levers it gives them to communicate, in order to survive, especially in times when their old models are being put under strain.</p>\n<p>Goode started GoSite after graduating from college in Michigan with a degree in computer science, having previously grown up around and working in small businesses &#8212; his parents, grandparents and others in his Michigan town all ran their own stores. (He moved to San Diego &#8220;for the weather&#8221; he joked.)</p>\n<p>His belief is that while there are and always will be alternatives like Facebook or Yelp to plant a flag, there is nothing that can replace the value and longer term security and control of building something of your own &#8212; a sentiment small business owners would surely grasp.</p>\n<p>That is perhaps the most interesting aspect of GoSite as it exists today: it precisely <em>doesn&#8217;t</em> see any of what already exists out there as &#8220;the competition.&#8221; Instead, Goode sees his purpose as building a dashboard that will help business owners manage all that &#8212; with up to 80 different services currently available &#8212; and more, from a single place, and with minimum need for technical skills and time spent learning the ropes.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There is definitely huge demand from small businesses for help and something like GoSite can do that,&#8221; Goode said. &#8220;The space is very fragmented and noisy and they don’t even know where to start.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This, combined with GoSite&#8217;s growth and relevance to the current market, is partly what attracted investors.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The opportunity we are betting on here is the all-in-one solution,&#8221; said Vinny Pujji, partner at Left Lane. &#8220;If you are a carpet cleaner or house painter, you don’t have the capacity to understand or work with five or six different pieces of software. We spoke with thousands of SMBs when looking at this, and this was the answer we heard.&#8221; He said the other important thing is that GoSite has a customer service team and for SMBs that use it, they like that when they call, &#8220;GoSite picks up the phone.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=xqhwzaMkO2E:X10L6JBCchg:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=xqhwzaMkO2E:X10L6JBCchg:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=xqhwzaMkO2E:X10L6JBCchg:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=xqhwzaMkO2E:X10L6JBCchg:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=xqhwzaMkO2E:X10L6JBCchg:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=xqhwzaMkO2E:X10L6JBCchg:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=xqhwzaMkO2E:X10L6JBCchg:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=xqhwzaMkO2E:X10L6JBCchg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/xqhwzaMkO2E\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 01 Dec 2020 11:28:08 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"c8715c5f30cbc0530da3e3ad676cfa3a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn12@2020_4/2020/12/01/14-27-30-103_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Ingrid Lunden","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn12@2020_4/2020/12/01/14-27-30-103_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn39@2020_2/2020/12/01/14-27-33-959_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn71@2020_4/2020/12/01/14-27-52-070_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=xqhwzaMkO2E:X10L6JBCchg:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn99@2020_2/2020/12/01/14-27-48-057_3b8fabbeaf73f49b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=xqhwzaMkO2E:X10L6JBCchg:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn47@2020_2/2020/12/01/14-27-34-134_fb006310d1490d73.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn56@2020_5/2020/12/01/14-27-33-965_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/xqhwzaMkO2E":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn32@2020_3/2020/12/01/14-27-34-041_424f7199e7195949.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1606832833447},{"createdTime":"2020-12-01 22:27:13","updatedTime":"2020-12-01 22:27:13","title":"Databand raises $14.5M led by Accel for its data pipeline observability tools","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2080835","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">DevOps continues to get a lot of attention as a wave of companies develop more sophisticated tools to help developers manage increasingly complex architectures and workloads. In the latest development, <a href=\"http://databand.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Databand</a> &#8212; an AI-based observability platform for data pipelines, specifically to detect when something is going wrong with a datasource when an engineer is using a disparate set of data management tools &#8212; has closed a round of $14.5 million.</p>\n<p>Josh Benamram, the CEO who co-founded the company with Victor Shafran and Evgeny Shulman, said that Databand plans include more hiring; to continue adding customers for its existing product; to expand the library of tools that its providing to users to cover an ever-increasing landscape of DevOps software, where it is a big supporter of <a href=\"https://databand.ai/open-source/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">open source resources</a>; as well as to invest in the next steps of its own commercial product. That will include more remediation once problems are identified: that is, in addition to identifying issues, engineers will be able to start automatically fixing them, too.</p>\n<p>The Series A is being led by Accel with participation from Blumberg Capital, Lerer Hippeau, Ubiquity Ventures, Differential Ventures, and Bessemer Venture Partners. Blumberg led the company&#8217;s seed round in 2018. It has now raised around $18.5 million and is not disclosing valuation.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>The problem that Databand is solving is one that is getting more urgent and problematic by the day (as evidenced by this <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/871513/worldwide-data-created/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">exponential yearly rise in zettabytes of data globally</a>). And as data workloads continue to grow in size and use, they continue to become ever more complex.</p>\n<p>On top of that, today there are a wide range of applications and platforms that a typical organization will use to manage source material, storage, usage and so on. That means when there are glitches in any one data source, it can be a challenge to identify where and what the issue can be. Doing so manually can be time-consuming, if not impossible.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our users were in a constant battle with ETL (extract transform load) logic,&#8221; said Benamram, who spoke to me from New York (the company is based both there and in Tel Aviv, and also has developers and operations in Kiev). &#8220;Users didn’t know how to organize their tools and systems to produce reliable data products.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It is really hard to focus attention on failures, he said, when engineers are balancing analytics dashboards, how machine models are performing, and other demands on their time; and that&#8217;s before considering when and if a data supplier might have changed an API at some point, which might also throw the data source completely off.</p>\n<p>And if you&#8217;ve ever been on the receiving end of that data, you know how frustrating (and perhaps more seriously, disastrous) bad data can be. Benamram said that it&#8217;s not uncommon for engineers to completely miss anomalies and for them to only have been brought to their attention by &#8220;CEO&#8217;s looking at their dashboards and suddenly thinking something is off.&#8221; Not a great scenario.</p>\n<p>Databand&#8217;s approach is to use big data to better handle big data: it crunches various pieces of information, including pipeline metadata like logs, runtime info, and data profiles, along with information from Airflow, Spark, Snowflake, and other sources, and puts the resulting data into a single platform, to give engineers a single view of what&#8217;s happening better see where bottlenecks or anomalies are appearing, and why.</p>\n<p>There are a number of other companies building data observability tools &#8212; Splunk perhaps is one of the most obvious, but also smaller players like <a href=\"https://www.thundra.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Thundra</a> and <a href=\"https://rivery.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Rivery</a>. These companies might step further into the area that Databand has identified and is fixing, but for now Databand&#8217;s focus specifically on identifying and helping engineers fix anomalies has given it a strong profile and position.</p>\n<p>Accel partner Seth Pierrepont said that Databand came to the VC&#8217;s attention in perhaps the best way it could: Accel needed a solution like it for its own internal work.</p>\n<p>“Data pipeline observability is a challenge that our internal data team at Accel was struggling with. Even at our relatively small scale, we were having issues with the reliability of our data outputs on a weekly basis, and our team found Databand as a solution,&#8221; he said. “As companies in all industries seek to become more data driven, Databand delivers an essential product that ensures the reliable delivery of high quality data for businesses. Josh, Victor and Evgeny have a wealth of experience in this area, and we’ve been impressed with their thoughtful and open approach to helping data engineers better manage their data pipelines with Databand.”</p>\n<p>The company is also used by data teams from both large Fortune 500 enterprises to smaller startups.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=USfWlHeiKOc:a9UsZWUFPzA:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=USfWlHeiKOc:a9UsZWUFPzA:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=USfWlHeiKOc:a9UsZWUFPzA:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=USfWlHeiKOc:a9UsZWUFPzA:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=USfWlHeiKOc:a9UsZWUFPzA:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=USfWlHeiKOc:a9UsZWUFPzA:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=USfWlHeiKOc:a9UsZWUFPzA:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=USfWlHeiKOc:a9UsZWUFPzA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/USfWlHeiKOc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 01 Dec 2020 08:35:02 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"157b7d6d4b0160d434d7006ca468c88a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn12@2020_4/2020/12/01/14-27-30-103_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Ingrid Lunden","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn12@2020_4/2020/12/01/14-27-30-103_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn39@2020_2/2020/12/01/14-27-33-959_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn71@2020_4/2020/12/01/14-27-52-070_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=USfWlHeiKOc:a9UsZWUFPzA:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn40@2020_2/2020/12/01/14-27-50-014_afa82682049862c5.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=USfWlHeiKOc:a9UsZWUFPzA:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn61@2020_1/2020/12/01/14-27-48-055_d636393095be4fa9.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn56@2020_5/2020/12/01/14-27-33-965_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/USfWlHeiKOc":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn29@2020_4/2020/12/01/14-27-52-227_8237494334a14f62.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1606832833447},{"createdTime":"2020-12-01 22:27:13","updatedTime":"2020-12-01 22:27:13","title":"Google Play’s Best of 2020 Awards highlight the stressful year it’s been","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2079320","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Continuing its annual tradition, Google today announced its <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/google-play/best-of-2020/\">Best of 2020 awards</a> &#8212; the company&#8217;s list of the best apps, games, movies and books for the year.

The sleep aid promises a mood-altering experience that helps its users deal with the negative emotions that accumulate during the day and are then processed during sleep. As anxiety and stress grow, people&#8217;s sleep patterns and REM sleep be disrupted, Loóna explains. To combat this, its app offers nightly &#8220;sleepscapes,&#8221; that combined activity-based relaxation, storytelling and sounds to help people shut out their stress and relax.</p>\n<p>Unlike other sleep or meditation apps where users close their eyes and drift off, Loóna is intended to help people wind down while still on their phones.

barriers to mental health care in Asia, says it has reached more than one million users just six months after launching. Google also announced today that the startup’s consumer app, also called Intellect, is <a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2020/11/30/google-best-android-apps-2020\">one of its picks for best personal growth apps of 2020</a>.</p>\n<p>The company recently closed an undisclosed seed round led by Insignia Ventures Partners. Angel investors including e-commerce platform Carousell co-founder and chief executive officer Quek Siu Rui; former Sequoia partner Tim Lee; and startup consultancy xto10x’s Southeast Asia CEO J.J. Chai also participated.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>In a statement, Insignia Ventures Partners principal Samir Chaibi said, &#8220;In Intellect, we see a fast-scaling platform addressing a pain that has become very obvious amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe that pairing clinically-backed protocols with an efficient mobile-first delivery is the key to break down the barriers to access for millions of patients globally.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Co-founder and chief executive officer Theodoric Chew launched Intellect earlier this year because while there is a growing pool of mental wellness apps in the United States and Europe that have<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/26/funding-for-mental-health-focused-startups-rises-in-2020/\"> attracted more funding during the COVID-19 pandemic</a>, the space is still very young in Asia. Intellect’s goal is encourage more people to incorporate mental health care into their daily routines by lowering barriers like high costs and social stigma.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"7GRbIajKpm\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/15/singapore-based-intellect-wants-to-lower-barriers-to-mental-health-support-in-asia/\">Singapore-based Intellect wants to lower barriers to mental health support in Asia</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Singapore-based Intellect wants to lower barriers to mental health support in Asia&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/15/singapore-based-intellect-wants-to-lower-barriers-to-mental-health-support-in-asia/embed/#?secret=7GRbIajKpm\" data-secret=\"7GRbIajKpm\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>Intellect offers two products. One is a consumer app with self-guided programs based on cognitive behavioral therapy techniques that center on issues like anxiety, self-esteem or relationship issues.</p>\n<p>The other is a mental health platform for employers to offer as a benefit and includes a recently launched telehealth service called Behavioural Health Coaching that connects users with mental health professionals. The service, which includes one-on-one video sessions and unlimited text messaging, is now a core part of Intellect’s services, Chew told TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>Intellect’s enterprise product now reaches 10,000 employees, and its clients include tech companies, regional operations for multinational corporations and hospitals. Most are located in Singapore, Hong Kong, Indonesia and India, and range in size from 100 to more than 3,000 employees.</p>\n<p>For many small- to mid-sized employers, Intellect is often the first mental health benefit they have offered. Larger clients may already have EAP (employee assistance programs), but Chew said those are often underutilized, with an average adoption rate of 1% to 2%.

Just this week, news arrived that Alibaba co-led<a href=\"https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/OjZl0DKkCuaUAB2mixTXKw\"> the $196 million C3 funding round of Nice Tuan</a>, the two-year-old grocery group-buying firm&#8217;s fourth round year to date.</p>\n<p>People in China shop online for almost everything, including groceries. At first, grocery e-commerce appears to have caught on mainly among the digitally-savvy who have grown reliant on the convenience of e-commerce and don&#8217;t mind paying a bit more for delivery. Many elderly shoppers, on the other hand, still prefer visiting traditional wet markets where ingredients are generally cheaper.</p>\n<p>Now tech companies in China are scrambling to capture grocery shoppers of all ages. A new business model that&#8217;s getting a lot of funding is that of Nice Tuan, the so-called community group buying.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>In conventional grocery e-commerce, an intermediary platform like Alibaba normally connects individual shoppers to an array of merchants and offers doorstep delivery, which arrives normally within an hour in China.</p>\n<p>A community group-buying, in comparison, relies on an army of neighborhood-based managers &#8212; often housewives looking for part-time work &#8212; to promote products amongst neighbors and tally their orders in group chats, normally through the popular <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/we-chat\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"we-chat\">WeChat <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> messenger. The managers then place the group orders with suppliers and have the items delivered to pick-up spots in the community, such as a local convenience store.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not uncommon to see piles of grocery bags at corner stores wating to be fetched these days, and the model has inspired overseas Chinese entrepreneurs to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/05/weee-profile/\">follow suit in America</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"U1hoUhdT0e\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/05/weee-profile/\">What grocery startup Weee! learned from China&#8217;s tech giants</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;What grocery startup Weee! learned from China&#8217;s tech giants&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/05/weee-profile/embed/#?secret=U1hoUhdT0e\" data-secret=\"U1hoUhdT0e\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>Even in China where e-commerce is ubiquitous, the majority of grocery shopping <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/31/meituan-grocery-delivery/\">still happens offline</a>. That&#8217;s changing quickly. The fledgling area of grocery group-buying is growing at over 100% year-over-year in 2020 and expected to reach 72 billion yuan ($11 billion) in market size, according to research firm <a href=\"https://www.iimedia.cn/c400/74181.html\">iiMedia</a>.</p>\n<p>It sounds as if grocery group-buying and self-pickup is a step back in a world where doorstep convenience is the norm. But the model has its appeal. Texting orders in a group chat is in a way more accessible for the elderly, who may find Chinese e-commerce apps, often overlaid with busy buttons and tricky sales rules, unfriendly. With bulk orders, sales managers might get better bargains from suppliers. If a group-buying company is ambitious, it can always add last-mile delivery to its offering.</p>\n<p>Chinese tech giants are clearly bullish about online grocery and diversifying their portfolios to make sure they have a skin in the game. Tencent is <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-29/tencent-primavera-said-to-fund-grocery-app-at-3-billion-value\">an investor in Xingsheng Youxuan</a>, Nice Tuan&#8217;s major competitor. Food delivery service Meituan<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/31/meituan-grocery-delivery/\"> has its own grocery arm</a>, offering both the traditional digital grocer as well as the WeChat-based group-buy model. E-commerce upstart Pinduoduo <a href=\"https://investor.pinduoduo.com/static-files/0d0c22e7-188a-4a4f-9692-a1c0c452c474\">similarly supports grocery group purchases</a>. Alibaba itself already operates the Hema supermarket, which operates both online and offline markets.</p>\n<p><audio style=\"display: none;\" controls=\"controls\"></audio></p>\n<p><audio

id=\"speakable-summary\">India’s Oyo has been one of the worst impacted startups with the coronavirus, but it has enough cash to steer through the pandemic and then look at funding further scale, a top executive says.</p>\n<p>In a townhall with employees last week, Oyo founder <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/person/ritesh-agarwal\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"ritesh-agarwal\">Ritesh Agarwal <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> said the budget lodging firm “continued to hold on to close to a billion dollars of cash” across its group companies and joint venture firms and has “tracked to runway very closely.”</p>\n<p>“At the same time, we&#8217;ve been very disciplined in making sure that we can respond to the crisis in a good way to try and ensure that we can come out of it at the right time,” he said in a fireside chat with Rohit Kapoor, chief executive of Oyo India and SA, and Troy Alstead, a board member who previously served as the chief executive officer of Startbucks.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>The revelation will deliver a huge reassurance to employees and hotel partners of Oyo, which <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/04/softbank-backed-indian-startup-oyo-to-cut-5000-jobs-globally/\">eliminated or furloughed over 5,000 jobs earlier this year</a> and reported in April that the pandemic had <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/08/indias-oyo-furloughs-thousands-of-employees-as-revenue-drops-by-over-50/\">cut its revenue and demand by more than 50%</a>.</p>\n<p>Oyo also <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/16/oyos-revenue-surged-in-fy19-but-loss-widened-too/\">reported a loss of $335 million on $951 million revenue globally</a> for the financial year ending March 31, 2019, and earlier this year pledged to cut down on its spending.</p>\n<p>Agarwal said the startup is recovering from the pandemic as nations relax their lockdowns, and with recent progress with vaccine trials, he is hopeful that the travel and hospitality industries will bounce back strongly.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Together globally, we were able to get to around 85% of the gross margin dollars of our pre COVID levels. This I can tell you was extremely hard. But in my view was probably only possible because of the efforts of our teams in each one of the geographies,&#8221; he said, adding that Oyo Vacation has proven critical to the business in recent months delivering &#8220;packed&#8221; hotels and holiday homes.</p>\n<p>During the conversation, a transcript of which was shared with employees and obtained by TechCrunch, Agarwal was heard talking about making Oyo &#8212; which was privately <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/07/india-oyo-ritesh-agarwal-investment/\">valued at $10 billion last year when it was in the process of raising $1.5 billion</a> last year &#8212; ready for IPO. He, however, did not share a timeline on when the SoftBank-backed startup plans to go public and hinted that it’s perhaps not in the immediate future.</p>\n<p>“And last but not the least, for me, it is very critical. I want the groups to know that I, our board and our broader management are fully committed to making sure that long-term wealth creation for our OYOpreneurs &#8212; beyond that of just the compensation, but the wealth creation by means of your stocks can be substantially grown.”</p>\n<p>“At the end of the day, what is the right time to go out is frankly a decision of the board to make and from the management side, we&#8217;ll be ready to make sure that we build a company that is ready to go public. And we will look at various things like that of the market situation, opportunities outside and so on, that the board will consider and then potentially help advise on the timeline,” he said.</p>\n<p>Alstead echoed Agarwal’s optimism, adding, “I think that <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/oyo-rooms\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"oyo-rooms\">OYO <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> is made up of a combination of assets, its hotels, its homes, its vacation homes. That&#8217;s unique, I think in the industry in the category, I think it makes it probably a little more challenging sometimes for people externally to measure and compare and benchmark a unique portfolio company like this. But I&#8217;d also tell you, I think that makes OYO resilient. It makes OYO balanced for the future. It gives OYO several sorts of vertical opportunities to address both customer needs at any time, whether it be a hotel or a small hotel or a vacation home.”</p>\n<p>“And it also gives opportunities and expands that interaction in a good healthy way with the property owners, with the partners, who have an opportunity depending on what asset type they have partnered with OYO in different ways, and also to have the access to a technology platform and a continued investment in that innovative platform for customers. So all those things, I think a balanced portfolio, a technology platform, a heavy focus on putting the customer first, putting the business partner first &#8212; all those things, in my view, are what positioned OYO for the future.”</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=X7iai5Q0rEs:t-mSxnVhox4:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=X7iai5Q0rEs:t-mSxnVhox4:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=X7iai5Q0rEs:t-mSxnVhox4:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=X7iai5Q0rEs:t-mSxnVhox4:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=X7iai5Q0rEs:t-mSxnVhox4:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=X7iai5Q0rEs:t-mSxnVhox4:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=X7iai5Q0rEs:t-mSxnVhox4:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=X7iai5Q0rEs:t-mSxnVhox4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/X7iai5Q0rEs\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 01 Dec 2020 13:27:04 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"6de6c3b544a826271cb13c6028de4a09","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn12@2020_4/2020/12/01/14-27-30-103_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Manish Singh","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn12@2020_4/2020/12/01/14-27-30-103_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn39@2020_2/2020/12/01/14-27-33-959_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn71@2020_4/2020/12/01/14-27-52-070_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=X7iai5Q0rEs:t-mSxnVhox4:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn4@2020_4/2020/12/01/14-27-33-953_76f1f35dd2262ca4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=X7iai5Q0rEs:t-mSxnVhox4:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn46@2020_3/2020/12/01/14-27-34-106_716ab0b782715705.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn56@2020_5/2020/12/01/14-27-33-965_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/X7iai5Q0rEs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn85@2020_6/2020/12/01/14-27-34-019_5a8a2381b29c12d0.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1606832833447},{"createdTime":"2020-12-01 22:27:13","updatedTime":"2020-12-01 22:27:13","title":"Nordigen introduces free European open banking API","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2078952","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Latvian <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/aax-b20d\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"aax-b20d\">fintech <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> startup <a href=\"https://nordigen.com/en/\">Nordigen</a> is switching to a freemium model thanks to a free open banking API. Open banking was supposed to democratize access to banking information, but the company believes banking aggregation APIs from Tink or Plaid are too expensive. Instead, Nordigen thinks it can provide a free API to access account information and paid services for analytics and insights services.</p>\n<p>Open banking is a broad term and means different things, from account aggregation to verifying account ownership and payment initiation. The most basic layer of open banking is the ability to view data from third-party financial institutions. For instance, some banks let you connect to other bank accounts so that you can view all your bank accounts from a single interface.</p>\n<p>There are two ways to connect to a bank. Some banks provide an application programming interface (API), which means that you can send requests to the bank’s servers and receive data in return.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>While all financial institutions should have an open API due to the European PSD2 directive, many banks are still dragging their feet. That’s why open banking API companies usually rely on screen scraping. They mimic web browser interactions, which means that it’s slow, it requires a ton of server resources and it can break.</p>\n<p>“If you’re wondering how we’d be able to afford it, our free banking data API was designed purely with PSD2 in mind, meaning it’s lightweight in strong contrast to that of incumbents. So it wouldn’t significantly increase our costs to scale free users,” Nordigen co-founder and CEO Rolands Mesters told me.</p>\n<p>So you don’t get total coverage with Nordigen’s API. The startup currently supports 300 European banks, which covers 60 to 90% of the population in each country. But it’s hard to complain when it’s a free product anyway.</p>\n<p>Some Nordigen customers will probably want more information. Nordigen provides financial data analytics. It can be particularly useful if you’re a lending company trying to calculate a credit score, if you’re a financial company with minimum income requirements and more.</p>\n<p>For those additional services, you’ll have to pay. Nordigen currently has 50 clients and expects to attract more customers with its new freemium strategy.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=yxs18ZrepOY:cZH1A5ZqoUk:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=yxs18ZrepOY:cZH1A5ZqoUk:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=yxs18ZrepOY:cZH1A5ZqoUk:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=yxs18ZrepOY:cZH1A5ZqoUk:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=yxs18ZrepOY:cZH1A5ZqoUk:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=yxs18ZrepOY:cZH1A5ZqoUk:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=yxs18ZrepOY:cZH1A5ZqoUk:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=yxs18ZrepOY:cZH1A5ZqoUk:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/yxs18ZrepOY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 01 Dec 2020 09:10:49 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"f684057f63ca7e8b9ecaa1541cbfdfa3","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn12@2020_4/2020/12/01/14-27-30-103_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Romain Dillet","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn12@2020_4/2020/12/01/14-27-30-103_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn39@2020_2/2020/12/01/14-27-33-959_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn71@2020_4/2020/12/01/14-27-52-070_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=yxs18ZrepOY:cZH1A5ZqoUk:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn22@2020_3/2020/12/01/14-27-34-231_be5c3bd5d63a4a2a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=yxs18ZrepOY:cZH1A5ZqoUk:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn52@2020_6/2020/12/01/14-27-34-171_18b5f35def138077.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn56@2020_5/2020/12/01/14-27-33-965_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/yxs18ZrepOY":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn28@2020_4/2020/12/01/14-27-33-918_cc2f2e8f4232aef8.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1606832833447},{"createdTime":"2020-12-01 22:27:13","updatedTime":"2020-12-01 22:27:13","title":"Ankorstore raises $29.9 million for its wholesale marketplace","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2079997","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">French startup <a href=\"https://www.ankorstore.com\">Ankorstore</a> has raised a $29.9 million Series A round (€25 million) with Index Ventures leading the round.

That list alone should remind you of neighborhood stores that sell a ton of cutesy stuff that you don’t necessarily need but that tend to be popular.</p>\n<p>The company works with 2,000 brands and 15,000 shops. And the startup isn’t just connecting buyers and sellers as it has a clear set of rules. For instance, the minimum first order is €100, which means that you can try out new products without ordering hundreds of items at once.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>By default, Ankorstore withdraws the money 60 days after placing an order. Brands get paid upon delivery. And of course, buying from several brands through Ankorstore should simplify your admin tasks.</p>\n<p>Ankorstore is currently live in eight countries — France, Spain, Austria, Germany, Belgium, Holland, Switzerland and Luxembourg. France is the biggest market followed by Germany. Up next, the startup plans to launch in the U.K. in 2021.</p>\n<p>In many ways, Ankorstore reminds me of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/13/distinguished-vcs-back-wholesale-marketplace-faire-with-100m-at-a-535m-valuation/\">Faire</a>, the wholesale marketplace that has raised hundreds of millions of dollars in the U.S.</p>\n<p>“There are a number of different retail marketplaces connecting retailers with makers and brands. Where we believe we differ is in our clear focus on the independent shop owner, offering the tools and the terms that make it really easy and cost-effective to discover and access some of the most desirable up-and-coming brands,” Ankorstore co-founder Pierre-Louis Lacoste said.</p>\n<p>Given that the startup is working with small suppliers, chances are they’re only selling their products in Europe. So there should be enough room for a European leader in that space that I would describe as wholesale Etsy-style marketplaces with a strong focus on curation.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2080010\"

With people working and doing everything else remotely, and with the general upheaval we&#8217;ve had in the global economy due to Covid-19, there has been an increased demand and strain put on the digital channels that people use to communicate with organizations when they have questions or problems.</p>\n<p>The catch is that customer relations has grown to be more than just 1-800 numbers and being on hold for endless hours: it includes social media, email, websites with interactive chats, chatbots, messaging apps, and yes those phone calls.</p>\n<p>Organizations like Sinch and Kustomer &#8212; which build platforms to help businesses manage all of those fragmented options in what are described as omnichannel offerings, have been capitalising on the demand and are now investing and looking for the next step in their strategies to grow.</p>\n<p>For Kustomer that has been leaping into the arms of Facebook, which itself has spotted an opportunity to build out a CRM business to complement its other services for businesses. Recall that it&#8217;s also been experimenting and working on its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/21/facebook-is-working-on-neighborhoods-a-nextdoor-clone-based-on-local-groups/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">latest Nextdoor competitor</a> to promote local businesses; and it has added a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/22/facebook-adds-hosting-shopping-features-and-pricing-tiers-to-whatsapp-business/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ton of business tools</a> to its messaging apps too.</p>\n<p>It will be interesting to see what Salesforce does next. While acquiring Slack gives the company an obvious channel into workplace communications, don&#8217;t forget that Slack is also a very popular tool for engaging with people outside of your employee network, too. It will be worth watching how and if Salesforce looks to develop that aspect of the business, too.</p>\n<p>For Sinch, its strategy has been around making acquisitions of its own, including paying $250 million to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/05/sinch-acquires-saps-digital-interconnect-messaging-business-for-250m/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">pick up a business unit of SAP, Digital Interconect</a>, which has 1,500 enterprise customers mostly in the US using it to run &#8220;omnichannel&#8221; CRM. Now the plan will be to do more, since there are still huge swathes of the market that have yet to upgrade and update their CRM approaches.</p>\n<p>Sinch, notably, is traded publicly on Sweden&#8217;s stock exchange and it currently has a market cap of SEK70 billion ($8.2 billion at current rates). It is profitable and generating cash so has &#8220;no need to raise funding for our ongoing business,&#8221; Thomas Heath, Sinch&#8217;s chief strategy officer and head of investor relations, told TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>For SoftBank, the investment marks another step in the company taking sizable stakes in fast-growing public or semi-public tech companies in Europe.</p>\n<p>In October, it put <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/13/kahoot-picks-up-215m-from-softbank-for-its-user-generated-gamified-e-learning-platform/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">$215 million into Kahoot</a>, the online education platform aimed both at students and enterprises, built around the concept of users themselves creating &#8220;learning games&#8221; that can then be shared with others. Kahoot trades a proportion of its shares publicly on the stock exchange in Norway and like Sinch, the plan is to use a good part of the money for acquisitions.</p>\n<p>Not all of SoftBank&#8217;s investments in scaled-up European businesses have panned out. Having put around $1 billion into German payments company Wirecard, the company turned out to be one of the biggest scandals in the history of European fintech, facing accounting scandals before <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/25/house-of-wirecard-insolvency/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">collapsing into insolvency earlier this year</a>.</p>\n<p>Sinch, as a profitable and a steady business with predictable lines of recurring revenue, looks like a safer bet for now. Even with Salesforce, Facebook and others raising their game, there as Sinch&#8217;s CEO says, there is enough of an untapped market that playing well might be enough to do well.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=TDTQb5GMkhA:ZFyEIWzR45g:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=TDTQb5GMkhA:ZFyEIWzR45g:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=TDTQb5GMkhA:ZFyEIWzR45g:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=TDTQb5GMkhA:ZFyEIWzR45g:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=TDTQb5GMkhA:ZFyEIWzR45g:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=TDTQb5GMkhA:ZFyEIWzR45g:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=TDTQb5GMkhA:ZFyEIWzR45g:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=TDTQb5GMkhA:ZFyEIWzR45g:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/TDTQb5GMkhA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 01 Dec 2020 13:43:49 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"05c4f586e79909a96a8126cca7805165","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn12@2020_4/2020/12/01/14-27-30-103_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Ingrid Lunden","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn12@2020_4/2020/12/01/14-27-30-103_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn39@2020_2/2020/12/01/14-27-33-959_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn71@2020_4/2020/12/01/14-27-52-070_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=TDTQb5GMkhA:ZFyEIWzR45g:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn23@2020_2/2020/12/01/14-27-34-069_018e70f66fb4f783.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=TDTQb5GMkhA:ZFyEIWzR45g:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn36@2020_2/2020/12/01/14-27-34-139_28ca3c7552b35e70.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn56@2020_5/2020/12/01/14-27-33-965_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/TDTQb5GMkhA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn32@2020_4/2020/12/01/14-27-34-015_cdef84c15f26f61e.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1606832833447},{"createdTime":"2020-12-01 22:27:13","updatedTime":"2020-12-01 22:27:13","title":"Vivenu, a ticketing API for events, closes a $15M Series A round led by Balderton Capital","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2080686","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a href=\"https://vivenu.com/\">vivenu</a>, a ticketing platform that offers an API for venues and promoters to customize to their needs, has closed a $15 million (€12.6 million) in Series A funding led by Balderton Capital.
