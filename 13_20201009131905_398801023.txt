The length of a taper can vary. You can have a really long taper (hair is longer) or a short taper (hair comes down closer to the skin).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unless you’re growing your flow out or you got a buzz cut, most haircuts for dudes will involve some sort of taper.</span></p>\n<h3>What Is a Fade Haircut? </h3>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-128727\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/09/Fade-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"530\" height=\"625\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/09/Fade-1.jpg 551w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/09/Fade-1-320x377.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 530px) 100vw, 530px\"></img></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A fade is a taper that gradually takes the hair down to the skin, so that it looks like the hairline on the sides and back of your head “fades” away before it reaches the natural hairline. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Basically, a fade is a </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">really </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">short taper. Hence, all fades are tapers, but not all tapers are fades.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fades are a bit trendier and give your face and head a bit of an “edge” — both in terms of its literal lines as well as in the overall impression or vibe the hairstyle gives off.</span></p>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-128736\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/09/Low-Mid-High-Fade-1-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/09/Low-Mid-High-Fade-1-1.jpg 750w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/09/Low-Mid-High-Fade-1-1-320x140.jpg 320w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/09/Low-Mid-High-Fade-1-1-640x281.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\"></img></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fades can start low, mid, or high.

This article was originally published in June 2013.</em></p>\n<p><i>Character</i>. <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/manly-honor-part-i-what-is-honor/\">Like honor</a>, it’s a word we take for granted and probably have an affinity for, but likely struggle to define and articulate. It’s a word most men desire to have ascribed to them, and yet the standards for its attainment remain rather vague in our modern age.</p>\n<p>It’s certainly not a word that’s used as much as it once was. Cultural historian Warren Susman <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/book/165902399/CULTURE-AS-HISTORY#download\">researched the rise and fall of the concept of character</a>, tracing its prevalence in literature and the self-improvement manuals and guides popular in different eras. What he found is that the use of the term “character” began in the 17<sup>th</sup> century and peaked in the 19<sup>th</sup> – a century, Susman writes, that embodied “a culture of character.” During the 1800s, “character was a key word in the vocabulary of Englishmen and Americans,” and men were spoken of as having strong or weak character, good or bad character, a great deal of character or no character at all. Young people were admonished to cultivate real character, high character, and noble character and told that character was the most priceless thing they could ever attain. Starting at the beginning of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, however, Susman found that <strong>the ideal of character began to be replaced by that of <em>personality</em>.</strong></p>\n<p>But character and personality are two very different things.</p>\n<p>As society shifted from producing to consuming, ideas of what constituted the self began to transform. The rise of psychology, the introduction of mass-produced consumer goods, and the expansion of leisure time offered people new ways of forming their identity and presenting it to the world. In place of defining themselves through the cultivation of virtue, people began to express themselves through hobbies, dress, and material possessions. Susman observed this shift through the changing content of self-improvement manuals, which went from emphasizing moral imperatives and work to personal fulfillment: <strong>“</strong><b>The vision of self-sacrifice began to yield to that of self-realization.”</b></p>\n<p>While advice manuals of the 19th century (and some of the early 20<sup>th</sup> as well) emphasized what a man really <i>was</i> and <i>did</i>, the new advice manuals concentrated on what others <i>thought</i> he was and did. In a culture of character, good conduct was thought to spring from a noble heart and mind; with this shift, perception trumped inner intent. Readers were taught how to be charming, control their voice, and make a good impression. A great example of this is Dale Carnegie’s <i><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0671723650/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=0671723650&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess-20\">How to Win Friends and Influence People</a></i> from 1936. It focused on how to get people to like you and how to get others to perceive you well versus trying to improve your actual inner moral compass.</p>\n<p>Susman argues that the transformation from a culture of character to a culture of personality was ultimately about <strong>a shift from “achievement to performance.” </strong>Susman illuminates this difference by noting that while the words most associated with character in the nineteenth century were “citizenship, duty, democracy, work, building, golden deeds, outdoor life, conquest, honor, reputation, morals, manners, integrity, and above all, manhood,” the words most associated with personality in the twentieth were “fascinating, stunning, attractive, magnetic, glowing, masterful, creative, dominant, and forceful.”</p>\n<p>There’s nothing wrong with the cultivation of personality, and we’ve offered plenty of advice on it here on the site. It can help you navigate the world, form relationships, and become successful. But personality is absolutely no substitute for character, which should be the foundation of every man’s life.</p>\n<p>Thus today we will be exploring the true nature of this largely forgotten ideal. We’ll be doing so by tapping into the writings of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, when character was still king.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">What Is Character?</span></h3>\n<p>The etymology of character is quite telling. The word comes from the Greek <i>kharakter</i> for “engraved mark,” “symbol or imprint on the soul,” and “instrument for marking,” and can be traced further back to the words for “to engrave,” “pointed stake,” and “to scrape and scratch.”</p>\n<p>Anciently, a character was the stamp or marking impressed into wax and clay, and as Henry Clay Trumbull explains in 1894’s <i><a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=TLUVAAAAYAAJ&#38;pg=PP1&#38;hl=en#v=onepage&#38;q&#38;f=false\">Character-Shaping and Character-Showing</a></i>, it served as:</p>\n<blockquote><p>another name for the signature, or monogram, or personal superscription, or trade-mark, of the potter, the painter, the sculptor, the writer, or any other artist or artisan, or inventor, as indicative of the personality of the maker, or of the distinctive individuality of the article marked. It is the visible token by which a thing is distinguished from every other thing with which it might otherwise be confounded.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In the 17<sup>th</sup> century, the word came to be associated with “the sum of qualities that defines a person.” These qualities included a man’s intellect, thoughts, ideas, motives, intentions, temperament, judgment, behavior, imagination, perception, emotions, loves, and hates. All of these components, William Straton Bruce writes in 1908’s <i><a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=9dsLAAAAYAAJ&#38;dq=the+formation+of+christian+character&#38;pg=PP1&#38;hl=en#v=onepage&#38;q&#38;f=false\">The Formation of Christian Character</a></i>, “go to the shaping and coloring of a man’s character. They have all some part in producing that final type of self, that <b>ultimate habit of will</b>, into which the man’s whole activities at last shape themselves.”</p>\n<p>The balance of these components within the soul of each man, and the way one or another predominates over others, is what makes a character unique and sets apart one individual from another.</p>\n<p>It should not be thought, however, that character is synonymous merely with personal tastes, temperaments, and preferences. Things like how you dress, your favorite music, or whether you are introverted or extroverted have little to nothing to do with character. Rather, character is defined in how your habits, motives, thoughts, and so on relate to morality, particularly as it concerns <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/living-a-life-of-integrity/\"><i>integrity</i></a>. Character was defined as “<b>your moral self</b>,” the “<b>crown of a moral life</b>,” and referred to as a “<b>moral structure</b>,” something you built through virtuous behavior. Bruce writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Character is nature and nurture. It is nature cultured and disciplined, so that natural tendencies are brought under the sway of the moral motive. His natural individuality marks off a man from his fellows by clear and specific differences. But this individuality may be non-moral. To produce character it must be brought under discipline, and organized into the structure of a true moral being . . .</p>\n<p>Above all, [character] includes a choice, a <i>settled</i> <i>habit</i> or <i>bent</i> <i>of</i> <i>will,</i> so that it can be seen in its outcome in conduct. Character takes up the raw material of nature and temperament, and it weaves these into the strong, well-knit texture of a <b>fully moralized manhood</b>.</p></blockquote>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">The 3 Qualities of True Character</span></h3>\n<p>To better understand the nature of character, we now turn to James Davison Hunter who laid out the three qualities of true character in his modern book, <i><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0465031773/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=0465031773&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess-20\">The Death of Character</a></i>:</p>\n<h3>Moral Discipline</h3>\n<blockquote><p>We cannot differ as to the need in our national character of those qualities of self-control, of quick and unquestioning obedience to duty, of joyful contempt of hardship, and of zest in difficult and arduous undertakings which, rightly or wrongly, we consider soldierly, which we attribute in such rich measure to our forefathers, and which the moral exigencies of our national task to-day as peremptorily demand. To put these primary and elemental needs as sharply as possible, let us call them discipline and austerity. Our American character needs more of both. –Robert Elliott Speer, <i>The Stuff of Manhood, Some Needed Notes on American Character</i>, 1917</p></blockquote>\n<p>The one quality most associated with character in the nineteenth century was self-mastery — the dominion of an individual over his impulses and desires, so that he was in control of them, and not the other way around. A man of self-mastery embodies <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/manvotional-the-kingship-of-self-control/\">the kingship of self-control</a> and can direct his will and make his own choices, rather than being a slave to his base impulses.</p>\n<p>Moral discipline is also a quality that not only allows a man to bear hardship stoically, but even to <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/call-new-strenuous-age/\">actively seek out a rougher, more austere life</a>, one that eschews the kind of indulgence that deprives character of needed training and leads to softness.</p>\n<h3>Moral Attachment</h3>\n<p>The pursuit of character does not have as its sole end the cultivation of self. Susman notes that it is in fact “a group of traits believed to have <i>social</i> significance and moral quality,” and he found that the most popular quote related to character during the nineteenth century was Ralph Waldo Emerson’s definition of it as: “<b>Moral order through the medium of individual nature</b>.” This is to say that the choices each single person makes influences the world around him, and that the existence of a virtuous society is predicated on the virtue of each of its individual members. Moral attachment means being committed to a set of higher ideals and to acting, and if need be, sacrificing, for the greater good of one’s community. Speer beautifully explains the meaning of this essential quality of character:</p>\n<blockquote><p><b>The moral elements of individual character are inevitably social </b>. . . When a man ‘has trained himself,’ to use the words of Lord Morley in dealing with Voltaire’s religion, ‘to look upon every wrong in thought, every duty omitted from act, each infringement of the inner spiritual law which humanity is constantly perfecting for its own guidance and advantage . . . as an ungrateful infection, weakening and corrupting the future of his brothers,” he views each struggle within his own soul against evil and each firm aspiration after purity not as a mere incident in his own spiritual biography but as a fight for social good and for the perfecting of the nation and of humanity. And <strong>the struggle for social good and the perfecting of human life is fundamentally a struggle for the triumph of ideals in personal wills</strong>. God can take hold of men only in man. He revealed Himself and wrought redemption less by a social process than by a personal incarnation. And the only way of which we know to uplift the life of the nation and to fit it for its mission and its ministry is to reform our own and other men’s characters, and ourselves to be what manner of man among men we would have the nation be among nations.</p></blockquote>\n<h3>Moral Autonomy</h3>\n<p>Character cannot develop in an environment in which ethical decisions are forced upon the individual. Character is a product of judgment, discretion, and choice — <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/increase-your-personal-agency/\">born from a man’s free agency</a>. A decision that is coerced cannot be a moral decision, and thus cannot be a decision of character.</p>\n<p>Davison summarizes the definition of character thusly: “<b>Character, in a classic sense, manifests itself as the autonomy to make ethical decisions always on behalf of the common good and the discipline to abide by that principle</b>.”</p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">How Does Character Develop?</span></h3>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-128947\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/character2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/character2.png 600w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/character2-320x260.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 615px) 100vw, 615px\"></img></p>\n<blockquote><p>Character gains through its expression, and loses through its repression. Love grows through its expression. Sympathy grows through its expression. Knowledge grows through its expression. The artistic sense grows through its expression. The religious sentiment grows through its expression. The capacity for instruction, for administration, for command, grows through its expression. The more a man does in any line of wise endeavor, the more he can do in that line, and the more of a man he is in that line. And the refraining from the free expression of love, or of sympathy, or of knowledge, or of the artistic sense, or of the religious sentiment, or of the power of instruction, of administration, or of command, both limits and lessens that which is thus repressed.</p>\n<p>To possess and to exhibit an admirable personal character is a duty incumbent on every one. In order to possess such a character, its exhibit by its expression is a necessity. <strong>He who does not endeavor to express those traits and qualities which are the exhibit of an admirable personal character, cannot hope to retain such a character, even if it were his by nature; and he who does endeavor to express them, can hope to gain the character which they represent, even though he lacked it before</strong>. –Henry Clay Trumbull, <em>Character-Shaping and Character-Showing</em>, 1894</p></blockquote>\n<p>There are many things that engrave our character upon the clay of our lives, and shape our character for better and for worse into a unique set of scratches and grooves. Our character begins to be shaped from the very time we are born and is influenced by where we grow up, how we are raised, the examples our parents provide, religious and academic education, and so on. Our character can be dramatically altered by a life-changing tragedy — the contraction of a disease, a severe accident, the death of a parent, child, or spouse. Such events may turn a man bitter or cynical, or may cause him to discover energies of soul and feelings of hope and compassion hitherto unimagined. A man’s character can also be greatly formed by a call to take upon himself a mantle of leadership during a crisis or emergency — an event that tests and exercises his physical and mental abilities.</p>\n<p>One of the greatest influences on our character is those with whom we surround ourselves, as Speer explains:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The important elements of character-making — or character-shaping — which we are most likely to overlook or undervalue are the exceptional impressions made upon us by casual acquaintances in our earlier life, and the quieter influences exerted over us by those with whom we are closely associated in after years — when our characters are commonly supposed to be fully and finally established. If we could trace back to their first exhibit some of the characteristics which now mark us most distinctively, we should perhaps find that we owe their development, not to the steady training in their direction received by us at home or in school, but to the sudden disclosure of their attractiveness in the life of some one whom we were with but for a brief season; or, again, we should see that the temptations which try us most severely, and the evil thoughts and imaginings which have given us greatest trouble in life, are the outgrowth of germs planted in our minds by persons of whom we have no distinct recollections apart from the harm they thus did us.</p>\n<p>Nor is it in childhood only that our characters are shaped and directed by our associates. The best characters are always open to improvement, and always in danger of deteriorating. Many a husband seems actually made over by his wife; and many a wife seems absolutely another person through her husband’s influence, after a few years of married life. It is perhaps a friend of our maturer years whose purity and nobleness, whose gentleness and grace, whose spirit of fairness and charity, or whose well-defined views on every point of ethics where he has a conviction, impress us with the correctness and beauty of his ideal, gradually influence us to his ways of thinking, and inspire us to strive toward his standards of judgment and feeling.</p>\n<p>Or again, our moral tone is lowered and our tastes are vitiated by intimate companionship, in social life or in business, with one of grosser nature, or of perverted and debased tendencies. Characteristics which had been long repressed in our nature come into new prominence, and those which had before distinguished us drop out of sight. <strong>So long as we live, our characters are in the formative state; and whether we be counted strong or weak, our characteristics are continually being re-shaped and re-directed by those whom we newly come to know and admire, or with whom we are newly brought into intimate association.</strong> A fresh ideal held before us, a purer, nobler, lovelier character coming distinctly into our range of observation and study, is something to thank God for; for it may be an inspiration to us, and a help toward the better and higher development of our characters than we have before realized.</p></blockquote>\n<p>As we can see, many factors, some beyond our control, play a role in molding our character. But the single greatest influence on our character is that which we have ultimate power over: how we respond to circumstances. Writers of the 19<sup>th</sup> century agreed that the true exercise and test of a man’s character was whether he would hold to his moral principles no matter how sorely tempted or how painful the repercussions. In 1888’s <em>Creed and Character</em>, Henry Scott Holland writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>At all costs, character must show itself to be free and above its circumstances. If a man is the creature of circumstances we call him a man without character; changing with all the changing hours, he has no self-identity, and character is that with which we identify a man. Character is vital and vigorous so far only as it insists on making itself free room for action amid the thronging events, and it dies down as soon as it fails to hold itself aloof and separate from circumstances. <b>Character is the reaction from circumstances.</b> It is the inner movement which encounters and withstands the shock of change and outward things. And it must, therefore, issue from a life that directs itself.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Many men feel like character is something that can only be built during dramatic tests and crises. But it is truly in “the constant, habitual, hurried, routine acts of common life that that swarm of little judgments is made such as form the character.” We would do well to remember that <strong>we are “</strong><b>being made every minute,</b> and we cannot help it — you and I, as we walk and talk, eat and drink, marry and are given in marriage, work and play, go out and come in.”</p>\n<p>As we are faced with varying circumstances each day and judge and decide how to act, our actions become our habits, and our habits become our character, as Speer explains:</p>\n<blockquote><p>By means of the will man passes from an intellectual state into act and deed. And these activities of the mind are not merely isolated movements; they become links in a series of actions and acquire permanence. The agent throws himself into these acts; and <i>in</i> <i>the</i> <i>exercise</i> <i>of</i> <i>knowing</i> <i>and</i> <i>willing</i> <i>he</i> <i>becomes</i> <i>characterized</i> <i>by</i> <i>his</i> <i>own</i> <i>deeds.</i> The more frequently he does the act, the more easy and pleasurable does it become. And this blending of pleasure and volition creates that tendency or bias towards doing it that we denominate Habit. <b>Therefore it is that we have spoken of character as a habit of will</b>.</p></blockquote>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Why Develop Character?</span></h3>\n<blockquote><p>Men of character are the conscience of the society to which they belong. –Ralph Waldo Emerson</p></blockquote>\n<p>Deciding to become a man of character means choosing to live a more disciplined and less selfish life. So why undertake such a hard path?</p>\n<p>Both classical and biblical cultures believed that the character of each individual was tied to the health of the society as a whole. The founding fathers argued that the citizenry’s commitment to living a life of character was the key in the success or failure of the republican experiment. “The steady character of our countrymen,” Thomas Jefferson said, “is a rock to which we may safely moor. <b>It is the manners and spirit of a people which preserve a republic in vigor.</b> <strong>A degeneracy in these is a canker which soon eats to the heart of its laws and constitution.</strong>”</p>\n<p>In a similar vein, James Madison wrote: “Is there virtue among us? If there be not, we are in a wretched situation. No theoretical checks — no form of Government can render us secure. <strong>To suppose that any form of Government will secure liberty or happiness without any form of virtue in the people, is a chimerical idea.</strong>”</p>\n<p>The founders rightly saw that without a people of character there could be no trust and justice, and thus no true community or stability. No true pursuit of happiness.</p>\n<p>What benefits the whole, benefits the individual as well. As Speer puts it, “only hardness can make a great soul” and <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/training-the-soul/\">the cultivation of character gives us the inner exercise that makes our souls grow</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>It is only where we have gone that we know the way; it is only the experience in life that we have passed through that gives us our true knowledge of life, because the end of life is its relationships, and wealth of life depends on the breadth of true knowledge and the riches of true relationship. Smoothness of life is simply deadening because it keeps us out of what is real life . . .</p>\n<p>[The] indulgent life [is worthless] because it cannot connect men and women with the real springs of strength and of power. No strong man was ever made against no resistance. We develop no physical power by putting forth no physical effort. <strong>All the strength of life we have we get by pushing against opposition.</strong> We acquire power as we draw it out of deep experience and effort.</p></blockquote>\n<p>A life of indulgence and ease, Speer concludes, “leaves men and women weak, with no strength either themselves to bear or to achieve for others.”</p>\n<p>Without seeking the power and strength that comes from building one’s character, we will lament that when we need the power of self-mastery, we do not have it:</p>\n<blockquote><p>And in our own lives the easy education does not go easily all the way. There comes a time when, having always indulged ourselves, we can’t break the habit; when, never having taken our lives in our hands and reined them to the great ministries of mankind, we discover that we cannot. We find that we obey our caprices; follow any impulse; cannot stick to any task; do not know a principle when we see it; have no iron or steel anywhere in our character; are the riffraff of the world that the worthy men and women have to bear along as they go.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Character offers a form of freedom that seems foreign in our modern age, but at least for me personally, still deeply resonates:</p>\n<blockquote><p><b>There is no freedom outside of character. Liberty, as Montesquieu says, is not freedom to do just as we please. Liberty is the ability to do as we ought.</b> And the freedom that we need is not the freedom of caprice and whim and listening to our impulses. It is the freedom that enables our eyes clearly to see what right is, and then empowers us to do it.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Speer also reminds us that just as the companions we choose can mold our character, so can we mold others:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We are ourselves the shapers and directors of the characters and the characteristics of some whom we meet or reach. This thought ought to give us a sense of added responsibility and of added anxiety. What we <i>are</i> may settle the question of what a multitude of others shall be and shall do. <strong>Our lives and characters are entering into and becoming a part of the lives and characters of those whom we never knew until recently, and their lives and characters are entering into and becoming a part of ours.</strong> The composition of their and our characters is still in progress.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Is our character influencing others for good and helping them build their own power and strength? Are we doing our part to be a man of character and infuse our culture and nation with vitality? What grooves and lines are you engraving upon your character each and every day? Character is our legacy — what will yours be?</p>\n<div id=\"pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg\"></div>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/what-is-character-its-3-true-qualities-and-how-to-develop-it/\">What Is Character?

Like, maybe, build a cabin in the woods.”</p>\n<p>My guests had these thoughts, and unlike most, actually pulled the trigger on their long-standing daydream. Their names are Bryan Schatz and Patrick Hutchison, and in today’s episode they share the experience they had as a result and which they wrote about in <a href=\"https://www.outsideonline.com/2417042/building-cabin-woods-podcast\">a recent article for <em>Outside</em> magazine</a>. We begin our conversation with how the idea of quitting their respective jobs as a reporter and copywriter to build a cabin together in the Cascades began as a joke between these two then burned-out 30-something friends, and how it slowly became a real, if still sketchy, plan to make it happen. Bryan and Pat share the idyllic way they thought the project would go, and when the reality of how much harder it would be than they thought set in. We discuss the unexpected challenges that arose, how the tensions of constantly working together affected their relationship, and how they kept an income coming in while on hiatus from full-time employment. We get into how long the cabin, which they originally thought would take two months to build, actually took to finish, the extent to which it went over budget, how they finally felt when it was done, and what they ultimately decided to do with it. We end our conversation with what, despite everything that went wrong, Bryan and Pat gained from the experience, and what they plan to do next.</p>\n<p><em>If reading this in an email, click the title of the post to listen to the show.</em></p>\n<h3>Show Highlights</h3>\n<ul><li>The genesis of Pat and Bryan’s idea to build a cabin in the woods </li>\n<li>Overcoming the suspect optics of this project</li>\n<li>Their initial experience with an old cabin they worked on </li>\n<li>What did they imagine the project would be like?</li>\n<li>What and when was the realization that this was going to be a lot harder than imagined?</li>\n<li>The original timeline for the project (and how laughable it ended up being) </li>\n<li>The small things that torpedoed their timeline and budget and mental health</li>\n<li>Was there a general budget?

But there’s a second “Doom Boom” going on right now, and people aren’t just burrowing into the earth to protect themselves from a nuclear bomb.</p>\n<p>My guest today traveled across four continents to explore what’s driving this phenomenon and how it’s manifesting itself in the modern age. His name is <a href=\"https://www.bradleygarrett.com/\">Bradley Garrett</a> and he’s a professor of cultural geography and the author of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07Z45GDLM/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=B07Z45GDLM&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess&#38;linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\"><em>Bunker: Building for the End Times</em></a>. We begin our conversation with the immersive dive Bradley took into urban exploration for his PhD, and how it led to his fascination with the building of underground bunkers. From there we dip into the history of bunkers, from the ancient subterranean cities built in Turkey to the governmental decisions made during the Cold War that led Americans to build blast shelters in their backyards. From there we dig into why a multi-billion dollar private bunker-building industry has emerged in the present day, and how it’s not being driven by a specific threat, but instead a diffuse sense of dread. We discuss how bunker building breaks down into individual and communal approaches, and why the latter is currently ascendant. Bradley takes us on a tour of two underground communities: one a complex of over 500 subterranean cement rooms in South Dakota, and the other a former nuclear missile silo in Kansas which has been turned into a luxe, 15-story inverted skyscraper of survival condos, complete with swimming pool, dog park, movie theater, and grocery store. We then turn to the modern movement of backyard bunker building, and how it often represents an act of resistance against the surveillance state. We also look at the culture of prepping in different countries, including the building of bug-out vehicles and fire bunkers in Australia. We end our conversation with whether or not Bradley ultimately concluded that bunker building and survival prepping is a rational response to the state of the world, and whether he became a prepper himself.</p>\n<p><em>If reading this in an email, click the title of the post to listen to the show.</em></p>\n<h3>Show Highlights</h3>\n<ul><li>How Brad’s life as an urban explorer led to his research into bunkers</li>\n<li>How long have humans been building bunkers?</li>\n<li>How did America’s Cold War decisions affect the future of bunker building and prepping?</li>\n<li>What’s driving this second “Doom Boom” we’re seeing?</li>\n<li>The difference between fear and dread</li>\n<li>Two primary approaches to building bunkers</li>\n<li>The Vivos complex in South Dakota </li>\n<li>Turning missile silos into luxe bunkers</li>\n<li>Prepper cultures in other countries </li>\n<li>The unique Mormon approach to disaster prepping </li>\n<li>What are these preppers going to do after the apocalypse?</li>\n<li>Is prepping for the apocalypse a rational response to our world?</li>\n<li>Has Bradley become a prepper?</li>\n</ul><h3>Resources/People/Articles Mentioned in Podcast</h3>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CCONTY6/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=B00CCONTY6&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess&#38;linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\"><em>Explore Everything</em></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1476735425/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=1476735425&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess&#38;linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\"><em>Raven Rock</em></a> by Garrett Graff</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/inside-burlington-bunker-britains-secret-underground-city-2017-1#in-1943-celebrated-artist-olga-lehmann-was-invited-to-paint-the-walls-in-the-canteens-of-the-factory-4\">UK’s Burlington Bunker</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.atomicheritage.org/history/greenbrier-bunker\">Greenbrier Bunker</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-make-a-bug-out-bag-your-72-hour-emergency-evacuation-survival-kit/\">How to Make a Bug-Out Bag</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/survival-bugging-in-shelter-in-place/\">A Survival Expert’s Guide to Bugging In</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-bug-in-what-you-need-to-know-to-survive-a-grid-down-disaster/\">How to Bug-In</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://thinkgrowth.org/the-doom-boom-inside-the-survival-industry-s-explosive-growth-2fece1f6cd6c\">The Doom Boom</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-live-off-grid/\">How to Get Off the Grid</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-survive-a-grid-down-disaster/\">How to Survive a Grid-Down Disaster</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/13/21255777/doomsday-shelters-bunkers-coronavirus-pandemic-covid-19-conspiracy-theory\">“Home, Sweet, Home?”</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.terravivos.com/\">Vivos bunkers</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/13/us/apocalypse-doomsday-capitalists.html\">“A Boom Time for the Bunker Business”</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/features/inside-the-survival-condo-nuclear-bunker-protecting-the-ultrarich-hacking-the-apocalypse/\">Inside Survival Condo</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.atlassurvivalshelters.com/\">Atlas Survival Shelters</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.skilledsurvival.com/bug-out-vehicle/\">Bug Out Vehicles</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/hydration-for-the-apocalypse-how-to-store-water-for-long-term-emergencies/\">Hydration for the Apocalypse</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezra_Taft_Benson\">Ezra Taft Benson</a></li>\n</ul><h3><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-129463\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/bunkerbook.jpg\" alt=\"bunker by bradley garrett book cover\" width=\"364\" height=\"550\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/bunkerbook.jpg 364w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/bunkerbook-320x484.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 364px) 100vw, 364px\"></img></h3>\n<h3>Connect With Bradley</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bradleygarrett.com/\">Bradley’s website</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/goblinmerchant\">Bradley on Instagram</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Goblinmerchant\">Bradley on Twitter</a></p>\n<h3>Listen to the Podcast!

Manufactured by  Some Day Incorporated, this vacuum is powered by procrastination and stands by ever waiting (and indeed, the operative word is </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">waiting</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">), to suck up good things from every area of your life.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Procrastination siphons off your money. Think of all the added fines you’ve accrued because you failed to pay your bills on time. Or all the investment returns </span><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/what-every-young-man-should-understand-about-the-power-of-compound-interest/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">from the miracle of compound interest</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> you’ve missed out on because you never opened that retirement account. Or the problem with your car that could have been fixed far more cheaply if it had been addressed when you first heard that funny little noise, rather than when your engine finally went kaput.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Procrastination steals your opportunities. If only you spent a bit more time studying for that test instead of cramming the night before, you could have passed the class. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If only you turned in that application on time, you could have landed that plumb internship. If only you asked out that girl you were crushing on (who a decade later you’ll find out was crushing on you back) before graduation, she could have been your life’s great love.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Procrastination holds hostage your health. Maybe if you had started that exercise and diet program sooner, you wouldn’t now be staring down diabetes. Maybe if you had gone in to see your doctor about that niggling pain right away, you’d be facing a diagnosis of Stage 2 cancer rather than Stage 4.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally — and this effect is perhaps the least acute but the most onerous as it weighs on your mind every.single.day — procrastination costs you a sense of peace and satisfaction in progress. When you look around and see the laundry still piled up on the couch unfolded, hear the drip-drip-drip of a still unfixed faucet at night, and remember for the 18th, and still unacted upon time, that you need to call to make a dentist appointment, it’s hard not to feel demoralized that you’ve been beaten in life by simple minutiae. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fortunately, while procrastination does indeed truly suck, its solution is as simple as the problem itself: an equation developed by a researcher who’s done more than ponder its pull and offer anecdotal hacks for its defeat, but has scientifically studied all its thieving angles.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">The Procrastination Equation</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why do we humans almost universally experience a mighty struggle with procrastination? It’s because we’re seemingly hardwired to favor short-term pleasure over short-term annoyance/effort, even if the latter leads to greater long-term gains. We like to do whatever feels good in the moment.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The key to overcoming procrastination is thus to increase your motivation for tackling a task, so you feel more inclined to do it now, and less inclined to put it off.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That’s the conclusion reached by Dr. Piers Steel, the foremost researcher of procrastination. In </span><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ZSHUP2/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=B003ZSHUP2&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess&#38;linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Procrastination Equation</span></i></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Steel explains that our given level of motivation for something is determined by four factors that interact in the following formula:</span></p>\n<p><strong>Motivation = Expectancy x Value / Impulsiveness x Delay</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let’s unpack the role each of these variables play in causing us to be more motivated (Expectancy and Value) or less motivated (Impulsiveness and Delay).</span></p>\n<h3>Motivation Multipliers</h3>\n<p><b>Expectancy: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How much you expect to succeed at doing a task. Several elements influence Expectancy. Steel’s research shows that an individual who has a higher sense of <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/increase-your-personal-agency/\">personal agency</a> — that is, confidence in their ability to get things done — will have higher levels of Expectancy than an individual beset with </span><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/boosting-your-resiliency-part-2-avoiding-learned-helplessness-and-changing-your-explanatory-style/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">learned helplessness — the belief that you don’t have control over your environment.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another factor that can influence Expectancy is the difficulty of the task. I picked this up from behavioral psychologist BJ Fogg’s book </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0358003326/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=0358003326&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess&#38;linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\">Tiny Habits</a>. </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you set “lose 100 pounds by the end of the year” as a goal, the daunting enormity of the task will weaken your confidence in being able to achieve it, likely resulting in you giving up before you even get going. A goal like “walk for 10 minutes each day,” on the other hand, is much easier to accomplish, which ups your Expectancy quotient, in turn increasing your level of Motivation and your chances of sticking with it.</span></p>\n<p><b>Value:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> How much you enjoy doing a task and how much you’ll enjoy the reward you’ll get for completing it (or dislike the punishment you’ll receive for failing to). Like Expectancy, several factors can influence Value. Your personal tastes have a significant impact on whether you value a task, and thus your likelihood of doing it. If you want to start exercising, and hate running, but set a goal of running every day, you’re probably not going to run. However, </span><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/the-benefits-of-rucking/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">if you do enjoy rucking</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and instead make it a goal to ruck every day, you’re far likelier to follow through on your intention. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How much you will enjoy/appreciate not only the process of engaging in a certain task, but its end reward, also influences Value. If getting an A+ on your research paper is really important to you, then you’ll probably work hard on your report and not put it off. If you couldn’t care less about getting an A+ and would be happy settling for a C+, you’ll likely be less motivated to get started on your paper. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Something that Fogg adds to Steel’s idea of the value lent to tasks, is factoring in the punishment of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">not </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">doing something on time. The bigger the punishment, the more you’ll value doing the task to avoid the penalty. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take paying taxes. Most people don’t like doing them, but if you don’t file your tax return or pay your taxes, there can be severe financial and legal consequences. So while you might not enjoy the reward of doing your taxes, you’ll definitely value avoiding the dire consequences of not doing them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(</span><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/overcoming-negativity-bias/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For more insights on how negative consequences can spur behavior, check out my podcast with John Tierney</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.)</span></p>\n<h3>Motivation Diminishers</h3>\n<p><b>Impulsiveness:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The degree to which you get distracted versus staying focused. According to Steel, Impulsiveness is a huge divisor of Motivation in the Procrastination Equation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While some people are more impulsive than others thanks to genetics, all of us have to grapple with impulsivity to one extent or another. And of course that’s more true than ever in the modern age, in which our smartphones and digital devices clamor for our attention. When you try reading </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">War and Peace </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">on your phone, as soon as you feel a slight niggle of boredom, you can swipe over to Instagram to see what new things are in the feed. </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/shallows-nicholas-carr-interview/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As Nicholas Carr, author of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Shallows,</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> discussed on the podcast</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, if you’ve been using the internet regularly for the past couple decades, you’ve likely experienced an erosion in your ability to concentrate — particularly when it comes to deep reading and reflective thinking, but also in simply being able to hold a conversation or clean up the kitchen without intermittently breaking off to check your phone. These short checks can turn into big time sinks, leading you to continually put off completing the task at hand. </span></p>\n<p><b>Delay:</b> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The fact that the further away the due date is for the completion of a task, the less motivated you will be to work on it now. The sooner something has to get done, the more motivated you’ll be to get to it. Concrete urgency encourages us to take action; a lack of urgency encourages us to be complacent. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We’ve all experienced this dynamic at some point in our lives. In college, when you had a research paper due in two months, you felt like you had plenty of time to work on it, and kept procrastinating getting started. Then, when the night before its deadline arrived, you finally did get going, because you </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">had</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Steel, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to increase Motivation, you simply have to</span> <i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">increase</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the factors in the numerator of the Procrastination Equation (Expectancy and Value) and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">decrease</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the elements in the denominator (Impulsiveness and Delay). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s as simple as that. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The trick is figuring out brass tacks ways of doing so.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thankfully, Steel offers some great suggestions in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Procrastination Equation</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Below I highlight those of his tips that I’ve found personally useful. I’ve also added my own suggestions based on Fogg’s research on motivation.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Ways to Increase Expectancy</span></h3>\n<h3>Use Vicarious Victory</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Steel suggests priming yourself with the feeling that you can accomplish what you want to achieve by putting yourself in touch with the stories of other successful people. Read biographies of great men doing extraordinary things despite the odds, or watch an inspiring movie or a pump-up video on YouTube.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While binging on motivational memes often comes in for criticism, as long as you use such fodder as a spur to action, rather than a substitute, it really works. I know that when I watch, say, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The</span></i> <i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Men Who Built America</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, I feel more pumped to get to work!</span></p>\n<h3>Use Mental Contrasting</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most motivational books tell you to envision your ideal end result in detail and just focus on that. But research shows that envisioning the positive outcome alone can actually increase the chances of you not completing the desired task. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead, Steel recommends engaging in “mental contrasting.” This requires you to think about your ideal result and then contrast it with your current not-so-great state. By contrasting your current reality with your ideal future reality, you frame the former as an obstacle to be overcome, which can, in turn, increase Motivation. </span></p>\n<h3>Overcome Learned Helplessness</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overcoming learned helplessness involves changing your mental scripts. Instead of telling yourself, “I’m a big giant procrastinator in all aspects of my life, and I always will be!” you challenge that negative self-talk. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do you </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">really </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">procrastinate in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">all </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">aspects of your life? No. You finish your work projects on time, you pay your bills on time. You just have some trouble getting going on that big project in the backyard. By pushing back on your negative thinking, you can show yourself that you’re more capable than you think you are, which can increase your sense of Expectancy.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(</span><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/tag/resiliency/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We did an in-depth series about overcoming learned helplessness and becoming more resilient. Be sure to check it out.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">)</span></p>\n<h3>Make the Task as Easy as Possible</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the Fogg Behavior Model, the easier the task is to complete, the more likely you’ll do it; the harder it is, the less likely you’ll do it. That’s just common sense, but common sense often goes overlooked.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you find yourself procrastinating on a task, see if there’s some way you can increase expectancy by making it easy. Like stupidly easy. This largely comes down to concentrating on the next action you need to take — getting specific instead of general — and breaking bigger/longer tasks into smaller/shorter ones. Fogg would in fact say to make the steps of your goal not just small, but </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">tiny</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-i-finally-made-flossing-a-habit/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If, for example, you’re trying to get into the flossing habit</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, instead of saying, “I will floss every night,” Fogg suggests setting the goal, “I will floss one tooth every night.” It’s easy to be motivated to floss a single tooth, so you’ll actually do it. Once you start doing one tooth a night consistently, you’ll naturally want to start flossing more of them (but you always keep the same Expectancy-boosting “floss one tooth every night” goal).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’re working on a term paper, instead of making it a goal to “Write the first draft of my research paper by the end of the week,” tell yourself, “I will work on the introduction for five minutes.” Writing an entire first draft is difficult, which means you’ll likely put it off as long as possible; writing for five minutes is easy, so you’ll do it. Once you’ve gotten started, you may want to write more, but even if not, at least you’ve gotten the project underway. Next set the goal: “Work on the body of the paper for five minutes.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead of saying, “Save $1 million for retirement,” make your task, “Email HR about auto investing from paycheck.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead of saying, “Clean up the entire backyard,” make your task, “Weed garden bed for five minutes.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You get the idea.</span></p>\n<h3>Use Success Spirals</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not only does taking small actions get you started on making progress in getting a big task done, it also creates a “success spiral,” which further fuels the Expectancy factor, spurring you to get even more done.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A success spiral occurs when you successfully complete one small goal after another. By seeing yourself achieve small goals, your confidence in your ability to get things done increases, increasing your sense of Expectancy, and your Motivation to do even more. A success spiral builds momentum like a snowball rolling downhill.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you’re feeling the glow from knocking off a to-do, use that surge of energy and confidence to tackle the next item on the list. </span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Ways to Increase Value</span></h3>\n<h3>Pick Enjoyable Tasks</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s more than one way to skin a cat, and to achieve a goal. Maybe you want to start exercising. Rather than trying to flagellate yourself through discipline to do a type of workout you hate, find a form of exercise that carries significant Value, because you genuinely enjoy it. You may think you hate every form of exercise, but the reality is that you’ve probably only tried four or five, and there are hundreds more to sample. If you don’t like running, try swimming; if you don’t like jiu-jitsu, try tennis; if you don’t like biking try boxing. Or forget all about “official” forms of exercise, and just become a dedicated walker. Experiment, and find something you’ll actually look forward to doing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Or let’s say you’d like to start reading more books. Rather than forcing yourself to try to read the high-brow material you’re “supposed” to enjoy, but struggle to keep picking up, choose a genre that actually makes it hard for you to put a book down.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are often multiple ways into the same result; pick one that provides you with plenty of spontaneous-yet-enduring Motivation. </span></p>\n<h3>Make the Task Enjoyable</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course there are some tasks in life where there’s isn’t a fun-flavored option to choose; there’s only one way in, and that way is onerous. But even in that case, you can still up your Motivation by making a dull, burdensome task, if not outright enjoyable, then at least a little more enjoyable than it’d otherwise be.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, as mentioned above, there’s not much fun to be had with doing your taxes. But you can make the process more pleasant by </span><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/10-albums-for-jazz-beginners/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">listening to a favorite jazz album</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> while sipping your favorite beverage. Likewise, as many a laundry-folder knows, the job goes down a lot easier if you listen to a podcast while you do it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A great way to make a task more enjoyable is to inject some sociality into it. In her book </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B079GH8LXH/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=B079GH8LXH&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess&#38;linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\">Life Admin</a>, </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">writer Elizabeth Emens takes a deep dive into the un-fun stuff we have to do to keep our day-to-day lives rolling along — filing taxes, filling out enrollment forms, planning parties, scheduling appointments, etc. The kind of stuff we have a tendency to procrastinate on. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One suggestion Emens gives to make doing “life admin” a bit more enjoyable is to create “Admin Study Halls.” Basically, you invite all your friends to your place, and together you work on all your respective life admin tasks. Working with others provides some accountability, but the big bonus is that sharing in the suffering makes the work more bearable.</span></p>\n<h3>Treat Yo Self </h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And then there are those tasks that can never be made more enjoyable, no matter how much you try. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take getting a colonoscopy. Colon cancer is one of the deadliest types of cancer, but if you discover it early, it can often be nipped in the bud. Colonoscopies are what allow for this early detection. Doctors recommend that you start getting them regularly when you reach age 50 (age 40 if you have a family history of the disease), but most people put off the procedure since it’s fairly unpleasant. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s not much you can do to make getting a camera stuck up your butt more enjoyable. But if you can’t add Value to the process itself, you can tie it to the end result by creating a reward for prioritizing the procedure. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tell yourself, “If I get a colonoscopy, I’ll buy that new [fill in the blank] I’ve had my eye on.” And then treat yourself to it once you follow through.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The more unpleasant or difficult the task, the bigger reward will likely have to be to sufficiently motivate you to take action. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’ve done the work of breaking your tasks into smaller, easy-to-do steps, the reward for completing those small tasks doesn’t have to be as significant. For example, if one of your tasks is “Work on report outline for 25 minutes,” your reward could be “Surf around on the web for 10 minutes.” If you successfully flossed one tooth, do a celebratory fist pump; I like to mouth the intro guitar riff to AC/DC’s “Back in Black” every time I floss.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Fogg, a reward/celebration for doing a task/habit can take any form. It just has to be 1) immediate, and 2) genuinely make you feel good. The resulting after-action glow creates positive reinforcement, increasing the perceived value of getting things done, and making you feel more motivated to keep up your to-do slaying effectiveness.</span></p>\n<h3>Punish Yo Self</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As discussed above, a counterintuitive way to add Value to a task is affixing a punishment for not completing it. As the penalty increases, you value the task more because you want to avoid the penalty. Don’t underestimate the power of the stick! </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ve added Value to tasks by increasing the penalty for putting them off by using a website called StickK. StickK allows you to create “Commitment Contracts” with yourself. You tell the site what you want to accomplish and when, and then — this is the magic sauce — you set a financial penalty for yourself if you don’t complete the task within that timeframe. You can even set it up so that if you don’t live up to your commitment, the money goes to an organization that upholds values you despise. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To prevent yourself from gaming StickK and saying you completed the task even though you didn’t, you can establish an accountability partner who will be asked to determine whether or not the task has been completed according to the terms of the contract. If your partner gives you the thumbs down, your credit card is automatically deducted for the amount you agreed to.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As with rewards, the harder the task is to get started on, the bigger the punishment has to be to provide sufficient incentive for completing the task sooner rather than later. </span></p>\n<h3>Connect Tasks to Bigger Meaning</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One easy way to increase the Value of a task is connecting it with your, well, values and the bigger meaningful vision you have for your life. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Setting up a 529 plan for your kid is boring and not fun. But helping your child get a good education may mean a lot to you. If it does, remind yourself of that in order to boost the Value of the task, and thus your motivation for completing it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’ve got tasks at work that you’ve been putting off, reflect on the way that their completion will, even in small ways, improve your customers’ lives, as well as the fact that your diligence at work allows you to provide a living for your family. Think about how you want to shield them from the worry of financial hardship. </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2mS3uDqQL4\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If it worked for Homer Simpson, it’ll work for you</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">How to Decrease Impulsivity</span></h3>\n<h3>Eliminate Distractions</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The best way to decrease impulsivity is to reduce the stimuli that tempt you to be impulsive in the first place. Pay attention to the things that distract you from your important work. For most people in the 21st century, the internet and smartphones are our biggest distractions. Instead of using pure willpower to suppress those digital distractions, eliminate them altogether. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Set up a system on your computer and smartphone that blocks distracting websites entirely or for set periods during the day. We go into detail on how to do just that in the following articles:</span></p>\n<ul><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-quit-mindlessly-surfing-the-internet-and-actually-get-stuff-done/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How to Quit Wasting Time on the Internet and Actually Get Stuff Done</span></a></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/break-smartphone-habit/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Complete Guide to Breaking the Smartphone Habit</span></a></li>\n</ul><h3>Improve Your Ability to Concentrate</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While your best bet in reducing impulsivity is to eliminate or decrease distractions, strengthening your willpower and ability to focus can definitely help as well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We dig deep into ways to strengthen your willpower and your concentration ability in the following articles:</span></p>\n<ul><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/your-concentration-training-program-11-exercises-that-will-strengthen-your-attention/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your Concentration Training Program: 11 Exercises That Will Strengthen Your Attention</span></a></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-strengthen-willpower/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How to Strengthen Your Willpower</span></a></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/12-concentration-exercises-from-1918/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">12 Concentration Exercises From 1918</span></a></li>\n</ul><h3><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">How to Decrease Delay</span></h3>\n<h3>Break a Final Deadline Into a Series of Mini Deadlines</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As discussed above, the further away the deadline is for the completion of a task, the harder it is to get motivated to work on it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It might seem like the solution would be to create your own, more immediate deadline for the task. But in practice, this isn’t effective; if a task is big and difficult (Expectancy and Value are low), an artificial deadline will not produce sufficient urgency to overcome these motivational drags. That is, pretending that the deadline for writing a paper is October 15 rather than November 15, won’t make you feel any more inclined to work on it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rather than moving the ultimate deadline for a task, a better tactic to decrease delay is breaking the project down into smaller chunks and assigning a series of mini deadlines that lead to the final due date. As already discussed, this move increases Expectancy and thus Motivation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I picked up this skill while in law school as I juggled writing and editing law review articles and getting ready for finals. Before any big project, I’d set down and map out my attack plan for it. I’d start from the final, absolute deadline. Then, going backward, I’d create deadlines for completing smaller chunks of that bigger task. I’d work my way back, setting deadlines until I got to the date I was planning out my project. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I still use this tactic today when writing articles for AoM. Here’s the schedule I set for myself for this one:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">September 29: Article publish date<br></br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">September 24: Edit and finalize draft; send to Kate for editing and revisions<br></br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">September 22: Have first draft done<br></br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">September 18: Outline article<br></br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">September 16: Collect all notes and review<br></br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">September 14: Review resources and make notes</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By breaking down the task into smaller chunks and assigning closer deadlines, I can decrease the sense of delay, which helps me not to procrastinate. What’s more, completing each step in the timeline creates Success Spirals, which can further increase Expectancy.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Your Procrastination Plan</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you understand the Procrastination Equation and the ways you can manipulate its variables to up your Motivation and take more immediate action, flipping off the switch on the procrastination vacuum becomes a cinch. Increase Value and Expectancy; decrease Impulsivity and Delay.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To make it even easier for you, here’s a suggested attack plan for whenever you find yourself procrastinating. Think of it as a checklist to keep you from ever putting things off:</span></p>\n<ol><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Recognize you’re procrastinating. </strong></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Ask yourself, “What’s causing me to put this task off?” Go through the different factors of the Procrastination Equation:</strong>\n<ul><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is there a way I can increase Expectancy for this task?</span></em>\n<ol><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Can I experience Vicarious Success?</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Can I create a Success Spiral?</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Can I make this task easier?</span></li>\n</ol></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is there a way I can increase the Value of this task?</span></em>\n<ol><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Can I choose an enjoyable way of getting it done?</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Can I make the task more enjoyable?</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Can I reward myself for this task?</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Can I punish myself for not completing the task?</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Can I tie the task to a bigger meaning?</span></li>\n</ol></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is there a way I can decrease Impulsivity?</span></em>\n<ol><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Can I eliminate distractions?</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Can I strengthen my willpower?</span></li>\n</ol></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is there a way to decrease Delay?</span></em>\n<ol><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Can I break this task down into smaller tasks and assign closer deadlines for each?</span></li>\n</ol></li>\n</ul></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Take action.</strong></li>\n</ol><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That’s it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As mentioned above, I only highlighted a few of the Motivation-increasing tactics Steel suggests in his book.

How do we figure out what to do? Much of the time, we don’t. Instead, we outsource our thinking to technology, experts, and set protocols. This, my guest today says, is where some real problems start.</p>\n<p>His name is <a href=\"http://www.mansharamani.com/\">Dr. Vikram Mansharamani</a> and he’s a Harvard lecturer who studies future trends and risks, as well as the author of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07XH27NTC/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=B07XH27NTC&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess&#38;linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\"><em>Think for Yourself: Restoring Common Sense in an Age of Experts and Artificial Intelligence</em></a>. Today on the show, Vikram explains how our increasingly complex lives have led us to increasingly rely on algorithms, specialists, and checklists to make decisions, even though experts are best suited to untangling complications rather than complexities. We then discuss the issues that can therefore arise in relying on expert advice, including the siloing of information and the application of misdirected focus. Once we diagnose the problem (and how the problem can, for one thing, muddy medical diagnoses), we turn to the solution, and how we can harness the good that technology and experts can provide, without undermining our ability to still think for ourselves, by doing things like asking experts about their incentives, knowing our own goals, triangulating opinions, and crossing silos. We end our conversation with how the serendipitous discovery of perspectives that can come from flipping through a magazine and browsing a bookstore can be part of restoring self-reliant thinking in the 21st century.</p>\n<p><em>If reading this in an email, click the title of the post to listen to the show.</em></p>\n<h3>Show Highlights</h3>\n<ul><li>The problems with relying on experts and technology to make our choices for us </li>\n<li>The rise of complexity, and how that changes our world (and the difference between complex and complicated) </li>\n<li>Maximizing vs. understanding </li>\n<li>Can AI really solve all the problems it promises to?</li>\n<li>How software and optimization can instill FOMO on our choices </li>\n<li>The meaningless data of rankings and reviews </li>\n<li>Choice paralysis </li>\n<li>When experts should step back and view the world outside their silo </li>\n<li>When a helpful checklist can lead you astray </li>\n<li>How to manage your focus </li>\n<li>What a prostate cancer screening test ended up causing more harm than good </li>\n<li>What is the Peter Principle?</li>\n<li>How to be more self-reliant in the 21st century </li>\n<li>The serendipity of flipping through a magazine or browsing a bookstore </li>\n</ul><h3>Resources/People/Articles Mentioned in Podcast</h3>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07R8DXGWK/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=B07R8DXGWK&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess&#38;linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\"><em>Boombustology</em></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/podcast-534-how-navigation-makes-us-human/\">How Navigation Makes Us Human</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/shallows-nicholas-carr-interview/\">How the Internet Makes Our Minds Shallow</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/escape-the-algorithm/\">Escape the Algorithm</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/life-hacking-history-benefits-downsides/\">Lifehacking, A Reexamination</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/podcast-517-what-big-time-catastrophes-can-teach-us-about-how-to-improve-the-systems-of-our-lives/\">What Catastrophes Can Teach Us About How to Improve Our Systems</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/the-pros-and-cons-of-outsourcing-your-life/\">The Pros and Cons of Outsourcing Your Life</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/world-without-mind-franklin-foer-interview/\">The Existential Threat of Big Tech</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/stop-hacking-your-life/\">Stop Hacking Your Life</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/meditations-wisdom-action/\">Meditations on the Wisdom of Action</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/shadow-work-and-the-rise-of-middle-class-serfdom/\">Shadow Work and the Rise of Middle-Class Serfdom</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/paradox-of-choice/\">Curing Your Restlessness: Limiting Your Choices</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/the-power-of-checklists/\">The Power of Checklists</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/everything-you-know-about-cholesterol-is-wrong/\">Everything You Know About Cholesterol is Wrong</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/10/opinion/10Ablin.html\">The Great Prostate Mistake</a> (and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1137278749/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=1137278749&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess&#38;linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\"><em>The Great Prostate Hoax</em></a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0062092065/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=0062092065&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess&#38;linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\"><em>The Peter Principle</em></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/ooda-loop/\">The Tao of Boyd: How to Master the OODA Loop</a></li>\n</ul><h3><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-129217\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/think-for-yourself.jpg\" alt=\"think for yourself book cover\" width=\"365\" height=\"550\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/think-for-yourself.jpg 365w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/think-for-yourself-320x482.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 365px) 100vw, 365px\"></img></h3>\n<h3>Connect With Vikram</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.mansharamani.com/\">Vikram’s website</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/mansharamani\">Vikram on Twitter</a></p>\n<h3>Listen to the Podcast!

As you pull yourself over the last rocky ledge, your foot slips on a loose rock, and you tumble backward, crashing into the ground below. As you collect yourself, you can already feel that something is very wrong with your shoulder. It’s dislocated. </p>\n<p>As far as injuries go, shoulder dislocations are relatively common for outdoor adventurists. The good news is that dislocations are often easy to treat once you’re in a medical professional’s trained hands. But, until that moment, they are exceptionally painful, especially if you don’t have a way to keep your arm still. That’s where a sling comes in. </p>\n<p>The purpose of a sling is to keep your arm immobilized, which is necessary for a shoulder dislocation. They’re also good for fractures, if used in conjunction with a splint. Slings are typically made out of large fabric pieces, but you can make them out of a shirt, towel, or even something like a tent’s rainfly. No matter what material you use, the technique is the same.</p>\n<p><strong>Like this illustrated guide?

I was struggling immensely with severe and debilitating anxiety and felt that I was losing control of my mind. I was having back-to-back panic attacks and honestly thought that I was dying. It was a truly terrifying experience and I felt overwhelmed with fear. My lack of education on mental health at the time meant that I didn’t understand what was happening to me. This made everything even more frightening. The fear of the unknown can often do this.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I began experiencing very physical and unsettling symptoms within my body, I didn’t think for one minute that my mind was causing it. How could my racing heart, shaking hands, and constant nausea be coming from my mind? I was convinced that it was a physical illness that I was facing. When I went to the doctor to get a better understanding of what was happening to me, I was genuinely surprised by my diagnosis: Generalized Anxiety Disorder and recurring panic attacks. All of this was coming from my mind. I didn’t realize how powerful my thoughts could be and the whole situation completely caught me off guard.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It took a while for me to process all of this and accept what was happening to me. I must admit that my ignorance and fear of being “mad” caused me to really resist this diagnosis at first. I was so worried about the stigma associated with mental health that I got distracted by my perception of the situation rather than the reality.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The doctor had suggested a few ways for me to address my anxiety (a cognitive behavioral therapy course and talk therapy) but I wanted to assess my options and educate myself on what was happening to me first. I could always decide to do CBT/therapy at a later date. To make an informed decision on how to deal with my anxiety, I began reading. This wasn’t just casual reading, this was a serious endeavor. I got so engrossed in figuring out what was happening to my mind that I became obsessed with reading as many books as possible. I was desperate for answers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During this intensive period of research, I came across a whole host of incredibly useful ideas. I read about CBT, Buddhism, and the concept of a “<a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/podcast-147-the-importance-of-developing-a-growth-mindset/\">growth mindset</a>.” I read countless books on mental health, self-help, psychology, and philosophy. I read biographies and autobiographies. Anything that might help me to understand my anxiety made it onto the list. I’ve never consumed so much content in my life. It was during all of this research that I came across Stoicism. This changed everything.</span></p>\n<h3>The Lesson the Stoics Taught Me About Embracing Voluntary Discomfort</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ideas within Stoicism instantly resonated with me and I deeply connected with them. I loved reading about how this ancient Greek philosophy could help me to live a better life. The pragmatic nature of the ideas appealed to me and the advice seemed to be timeless. There were so many concepts that I found useful from negative visualization all the way to how we respond to events outside of our control (this was particularly helpful for my panicky mindset).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My reading choices started to change and more Stoic philosophy made its way onto my ever-growing reading list. As I began to further understand the philosophy, I started to appreciate <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/manvotional-jack-london-on-developing-a-philosophy-of-life/\">how beneficial having a philosophy of life was</a>. And this is really what Stoicism is all about – establishing a way to live a good life.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There was one particular Stoic concept that truly changed my life though. I credit this as dramatically altering my mindset and changing my relationship with anxiety in a very positive way. This was the concept of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">voluntary discomfort</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The Stoics would deliberately expose themselves to adversity in order to prepare for future adversity. The Stoic philosopher Musonius Rufus sums this up perfectly:</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We will train both soul and body when we accustom ourselves to cold, heat, thirst, hunger, scarcity of food, hardness of bed, abstaining from pleasures, and enduring pains.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For some reason, I really connected with this idea. I knew that going to the gym would build physical strength, but I hadn’t thought much about building a strong and resilient mind before. The diverse ways that the Stoics would do this inspired me and got me thinking about how I could create a training program for my mind. I had lots of questions about this concept when I first encountered it: What ideas and situations could I use to build resilience? Would this help me to address my anxiety? Was this a good platform to test out all of the philosophy I had been reading about? Could something so counterintuitive really work? My mind was busy as I began to create a list of personal challenges that I could use to test out this idea of voluntary discomfort.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I eventually plucked up the courage to give it a try and began to create my own challenges as a way to “toughen myself up” just like the Stoics. The more I completed, the more confident I became. I could feel that my mind was changing and this was a good thing. When I stopped having panic attacks, I knew that there was value in this idea. I leaned into it and went “all-in” on the Stoic concept of practicing adversity.</span><b> </b></p>\n<h3>The Challenges I Created for Myself<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_129490\" style=\"width: 710px;  border: 1px solid #dddddd; background-color: #f3f3f3; padding: 4px; margin: 10px; text-align:center; display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-129490\" class=\"wp-image-129490\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/ben-collage.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/ben-collage.jpg 2000w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/ben-collage-768x768.jpg 768w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/ben-collage-1536x1536.jpg 1536w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/ben-collage-320x320.jpg 320w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/ben-collage-640x640.jpg 640w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/ben-collage-1280x1280.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"></img><p style=\" padding: 0 4px 5px; margin: 0;\" id=\"caption-attachment-129490\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Some scenes from the challenges I created and continue to create for myself.</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some of my challenges were taken directly from the Stoics, whereas others were lightly inspired by them. However, the majority of the challenges were based on personal ways for me to practice discomfort and leave my comfort zone. They started off small (as I was in a very anxious place to begin with) but, over time, progressed into bigger and bolder things. Here are a few examples:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To push my body, I ran my first marathon, climbed mountains, and completed a long-distance walk. I challenged myself in the gym in a variety of different ways, completed triathlons, and tried new and unfamiliar sports. Whilst fighting fatigue and physical hardships, I learned about my mind and how it responds to exhaustion. I got to experience a lot of physical discomfort with these challenges and got to practice working with this in a constructive way.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To push my mind, I exposed myself to the cold with ice-baths, <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/cold-shower-benefits/\">cold showers</a>, and swimming in the British sea in winter. I slept in unusual places, faced a serious fear of needles by getting acupuncture, <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/spiritual-disciplines-fasting/\">fasted</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/a-primer-on-meditation/\">learned how to meditate</a>. I also ate unusual food and stood in lines for absolutely no purpose other than to test my mindset. I started to wear inappropriate clothes for the weather and the occasional outrageous outfit (I’m an introvert so this was very difficult for me). This was a challenge that the Stoic-philosopher Cato would do in order to practice feeling comfortable with shame; when his peers laughed at him, he would focus on how he responded to these emotions and would treat this as a test of character.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To further challenge my mind, I started learning new skills and would pay attention to what my mind was doing in the process. It was interesting to explore my relationship with the frustrations I encountered. I started learning Japanese and can now have a conversation in the language without my brain hurting too much (well, almost). I learned how to solve a Rubik’s cube in under a minute, fold complicated origami, juggle, and <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-pick-a-lock-pin-tumbler-locks/\">pick locks</a>. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The challenges pushed me out of my comfort zone in many different ways and helped me to test out the ideas I had been reading about in a relatively controlled environment. They’ve taught me so much about myself and how I respond to difficulty.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I’m 22 miles into a marathon and my mind is begging me to stop, this is a wonderful time to lean into Stoicism. When I’m enduring the pain of an ice bath, this is the perfect opportunity to embrace discomfort. When I’m learning a new skill, dealing with frustrations, or pushing myself with a fiddly task, this is a fantastic time to pay attention to my mindset. This philosophical framework has helped me to face these challenges and gives them a higher purpose. When I view everything as a form of “mind training,” it allows me to give value to every challenge I complete. Eventually, this started to bleed into other areas of my life and I could use normal day-to-day problems as an opportunity to challenge myself. Traffic: the perfect test of patience. Someone is rude: the perfect test for measuring and controlling my response. There are many more examples of this and it has been a great way for me to reframe tough situations. I don’t always pass the test, but seeing it as a test</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">helps me to learn from life’s difficulties.</span></p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since starting to explore voluntary discomfort, I have been on countless adventures and have ended up doing things that I never thought I would be capable of. It’s safe to say that my life has been very different since discovering the empowering Stoic theory that <em>we prepare for adversity by practicing adversity</em>. I’m in control of my anxiety now and I’m not the panicky mess that I once was. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While I feel very grateful to have found this tool, it’s important to note that I wouldn’t for one minute say that I am prepared for everything that fate might throw at me. Not at all! That would be unbelievably arrogant. What I really want to put across is that I am better prepared than I used to be. I’m not perfect (far from it), but I am working to better myself each day. I feel a lot more confident at handling the curveballs life throws at me than I was in the past. A few years ago, I couldn’t walk to the bench in my local park without freaking out. I now deliberately seek out difficult and scary situations. This has been real and significant progress for me. There is always room for improvement though and I’m excited to see where all of this takes me. I will continue to push myself out of my comfort zone and lean into Stoicism.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I believe that stepping outside of our comfort zones can be a great way to build mental resilience and I would encourage you to try it out for yourself. Why not seek out some challenges that will scare you senseless and push you into the unknown? That way you can put your personal philosophy to the test. As Epictetus (the legendary Stoic philosopher) famously put it:</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don’t explain your philosophy. Embody it.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Listen to the podcast too:</strong> </span></p>\n<p><iframe title=\"#640: Weird and Wonderful Ways to Get Comfortable Being Uncomfortable\" src=\"https://omny.fm/shows/the-art-of-manliness/640-weird-and-wonderful-ways-to-get-comfortable-be/embed\" width=\"100%\" height=\"180\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">_______________________________________</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.benaldridge.com\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ben Aldridge</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> writes about practical philosophy, comfort zones, mental health, and adventure.

Along the way he got a chance to unwind, decompress, and shift his mindset from warrior to civilian. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A soldier coming home from Afghanistan could be on the frontlines one day, and back with his family 48 hours later. Some have argued that moving modern servicemen straight from operations to leave has contributed to difficulties reintegrating and high rates of PTSD.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s easy to underestimate the importance of transitions, not only in the context of such dramatic changes, but ordinary ones as well.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We think of “rites of passage” — rituals of time, space, and ceremony that move an individual from one group, role, or status to another — as big, linear, one-time transformations like going from single to married. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But rites of passage can also helpfully be thought of in terms of small, back-and-forth pivots you repeatedly make each day.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From sunrise to sunset individuals wear many hats, and must toggle between various mindsets. But we tend to swivel between them without real transitions. As a result, parts of our previous roles linger with us, leaving us unable to be fully present and engaged in the subsequent ones. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meditating between rising and leaving for work. Putting on athletic clothes and sipping a preworkout drink to shift from the office to the gym. Shutting off the monetary mindset by shutting down one’s phone at family dinner. Donning Sunday-best duds and turning on edifying music to set the Sabbath day apart from Saturday. Reading a paperback book by lantern-light before bed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Putting such rituals in your routine helps you move between sleep and wakefulness, work and home, sacred practices and mundane habits — through our daily journeys there and back again.</span></p>\n<div id=\"pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg\"></div>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/sunday-firesides-your-routine-needs-rites-of-passage/\">Sunday Firesides: Your Routine Needs Rites of Passage</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com\">The Art of Manliness</a>.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheArtOfManliness/~4/prGK8o8cIgo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 04 Oct 2020 05:20:46 +0000","feedId":13,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"a189496a7a69fb0ef23e0a3ea6464be7","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Brett and Kate McKay","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/Rights-of-Passage-Header-4.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn27@2020_1/2020/10/09/13-18-50-249_729821f1f561f93d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheArtOfManliness/~4/prGK8o8cIgo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn98@2020_2/2020/10/09/13-18-50-310_efa34fb46c77d687.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602249497960},{"createdTime":"2020-10-09 21:18:17","updatedTime":"2020-10-09 21:18:17","title":"Podcast #648: Lessons in Building Rapport from Experts in Terrorist Interrogation","link":"https://www.artofmanliness.com/?p=128683","description":"<h4 id=\"pressboard-ad-sponsorship-tag\" style=\"margin-bottom: 35px;\"></h4><p><iframe title=\"#648: Lessons in Building Rapport from Experts in Terrorist Interrogation\" src=\"https://omny.fm/shows/the-art-of-manliness/648-lessons-in-building-rapport-from-experts-in-te/embed\" width=\"100%\" height=\"180\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<p>What do you imagine when you imagine a terrorist being interrogated by an intelligence officer? The former getting roughed up? The latter yelling, banging his fists on the table, and demanding that the detainee talk?</p>\n<p>My guests today argue that using force in this way to get what you want isn’t effective when you’re dealing with a terrorist, or, for that matter, a teenager. Their names are Laurence and Emily Alison, and they’re a married pair of forensic psychologists, as well as the authors of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B083FFXGSB/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=B083FFXGSB&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess&#38;linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\"><em>Rapport: The Four Ways to Read People</em></a>. We begin our conversation with how through their extensive experience in training police, military, and security agencies like the FBI and CIA on how to conduct interrogations of criminals and terrorists, the Alisons discovered that literal and metaphorical browbeating was ineffective in inducing communication and cooperation, and that methods which built rapport were much more successful. We then discuss why building rapport in order to handle conflict, avoid arguments, and create connections is important not only in interrogation rooms but at work and at home. From there we dive into the four elements that make up this model of interpersonal communication, the last of which we demonstrate with some role play. We end our conversation with the idea of the “animal wheel,” in which different personality styles are represented by a mouse, lion, T-Rex, and monkey, and the importance of understanding your own interpersonal style and that of the person you’re engaging with, so you can predict how they’ll react, and adapt accordingly. </p>\n<p><em>If reading this in an email, click the title of the post to listen to the show.</em></p>\n<h3>Show Highlights</h3>\n<ul><li>What is rapport?
