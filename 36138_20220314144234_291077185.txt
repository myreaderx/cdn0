A favorite engineer of Frank Sinatra, Nat King Cole, Ray Charles and more, the late Bill Putnam Sr. was a passionate innovator who is widely regarded as the father of modern recording — with many of his legendary studio and equipment designs still in use today.</p> \n<p>Universal Audio was re-founded in 1999 by Bill’s sons, James Putnam and Bill Putnam Jr., with two main goals: to faithfully reproduce classic analog recording equipment in the tradition of their father; and to design new digital recording tools in with the sound and spirit of vintage analog technology. To that end, Universal Audio employs the world’s brightest DSP engineers and digital modeling authorities to develop our award-winning UAD Powered Plug-Ins platform. Featuring the most authentic analog emulation plug-ins in the industry, our DSP gurus work with the original hardware manufacturers — using their exact schematics, golden units, and experienced ears — to give UAD plug-ins warmth and harmonics in all the right places, just like analog.</p> \n<p>With 165 employees and offices in Los Angeles, Colorado, and Amsterdam, Universal Audio is headquartered near Silicon Valley in Scotts Valley, California — where our classic analog gear is still hand-built, one unit at a time.</p> \n<p>Software or hardware, every Universal Audio product is backed by a decade’s long legacy of innovation, superlative quality, and technical passion.</p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<hr /> \n<h3><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://blog.dubspot.com/files/2011/10/mixing-mastering-banner.jpg\" width=\"NaN\" height=\"NaN\" /></h3> \n<h3><a href=\"http://www.dubspot.com/mixing-and-mastering/\" target=\"_blank\">Mixing and Mastering Program</a></h3> \n<p>Transform rough ideas and basic compositions into dance floor bangers and sonically pleasing commercial quality masters.
