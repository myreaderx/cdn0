As people spend more time at home and the need for relevant, fresh content is at an all time high, the shift <a href=\"https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/marketing-resources/data-measurement/how-to-select-an-ad-budget-and-avoid-waste/\">from linear to digital</a> video is accelerating.</p><p>On YouTube in particular, over 2 billion people globally are gravitating toward timely content, from live entertainment like <a href=\"https://blog.youtube/culture-and-trends/youtube-your-virtual-concert-venue/\">Post Malone's livestreamed living room concerts</a> to transformative current events like <a href=\"https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/consumer-insights/racial-justice-video-trends/\">rallying cries for racial justice</a> from creators. They are also favoring the TV screen—with watch time growing across regions. In the US for example, watch time on YouTube and YouTube TV on TV screens jumped <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/ads/youtube-streaming-trends-features/\">80 percent year over year</a>. </p><p>Leading brands are making the most of YouTube’s massive reach and deeply relevant content to build brand awareness, and ultimately, drive results at scale. Today, we're sharing new ways to help advertisers achieve these goals, including expanded reach planning solutions and advanced contextual targeting—a new and better way to show up in the right contexts for your customers.</p><p><br/></p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>Expanded tools to drive efficient reach and fuel your awareness strategy on YouTube</h3><p>More viewership and the right mix of tools to reach a growing audience means that YouTube can offer incremental reach for the same budget. In the US, our relationship with Nielsen helps advertisers find the right mix. On average, advertisers saw that shifting just 20% of spend from TV to YouTube generated a 25% increase to the total campaign reach within their target audience, lowering the cost per reach point by almost 20%, across 21 Share Shift studies we've commissioned from Nielsen.<sup>1</sup> To help global marketers, we are expanding our evaluation of <a href=\"https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/solutions/capabilities/ratings/\">Nielsen’s Total Ad Ratings</a> to the UK and Italy.</p><p>When marketers include YouTube to drive efficient reach, they are seeing it pay off in real business results. Katie Haniffy, Head of Media, PepsiCo Beverages, turned to YouTube to drive scale and extend reach of Pepsi’s “Gift it Forward” Holiday campaign. The creative, starring Cardi B, celebrated the gifting mindset during the holiday season.  \"We knew YouTube had to play a critical role in ‘Gift it Forward’ as it continues to deliver strong performance across the beverage portfolio. The ‘Gift it Forward’ campaign did not disappoint—YouTube drove new brand buyers during the holiday season to the unique audience we wanted to reach.”<br/></p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \"><img alt=\"32003_YT_Awareness_Blog_v07a (1).png\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/32003_YT_Awareness_Blog_v07a_2.max-1000x1000.png\"/></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>To help you easily plan campaign strategies that take advantage of this incremental reach beyond TV, soon we are also expanding <a href=\"https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/9946293\">TV data in Reach Planner</a> to more countries, including France, Spain and Vietnam.</p><p>Additionally, if you’re looking to plan YouTube with other online video partners, we’re enabling <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/marketingplatform/360/grow-your-brand-new-google-marketing-platform-tools\">reach planning</a> capabilities across your entire campaign in Display &amp; Video 360 including YouTube, auction and programmatic deals. </p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \"><img alt=\"Awareness_ProTip_v01.png\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/pro_tip.max-1000x1000.png\"/></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p><i><b>Use <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/ads/full-funnel-video/\">Video reach campaigns</a> for a simpler way to buy efficient reach across ad formats. </b></i></p><p>Since launch, we’ve seen when advertisers combine skippable in-stream ads and bumpers into one campaign optimized for unique reach, they see higher lifts in Brand Awareness than advertisers who bought either format on its own.<sup>4  </sup>Marion Carpentier, Omni Business Leader at French men’s wear brand, Jules, says “By combining multiple formats into one campaign on YouTube, we were not only able to reach incremental audiences at a more optimal frequency compared to other video partners, but were able to drive a relative brand lift of 4.9 percent.” </p><p><br/></p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>A new way to show up in the right contexts for your brand</h3><p>YouTube’s ability to drive mass reach means we can also deliver scale in specific contexts that matter for consumers and your brand.
