But the light does return to lift the darkness and restore the world&#8217;s color &#8212; as in nature, so in <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2018/05/10/america-ferrera-sojourns-in-the-parallel-world-denise-levertov/\">the subset of it that is human nature</a>. “We forget that nature itself is one vast miracle transcending the reality of night and nothingness,&#8221; Loren Eiseley wrote in <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2017/06/22/loren-eiseley-muskrat/\">one of the greatest essays ever written</a>. &#8220;We forget that each one of us in his personal life repeats that miracle.”</p>\n<p>We forget, too, just how much of life&#8217;s miraculousness resides in the latitude of the spectrum of experience and our dance across it, how much of life&#8217;s vibrancy radiates from the contrast between the various hues, between the darkness and the light. There is, after all, something eminently uninteresting about a perpetually blue sky. Van Gogh knew this when he contemplated <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2018/08/22/van-gogh-sorrow/\">&#8220;the drama of a storm in nature, the drama of sorrow in life&#8221;</a> as essential fuel for art and life. Coleridge knew it as he huddled in a hollow to behold &#8220;the power and ‘eternal link’ of energy&#8221; in his <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2020/07/08/coleridge-storm-letter/\">transcendent encounter with a violent storm</a>. </p>\n<p>The life-affirming splendor of the spectrum within and without is what Japanese poet and picture-book author <strong>Hiroshi Osada</strong> and artist <strong>Ryoji Arai</strong> celebrate in <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Every-Color-Light-Book-about/dp/1592702910/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>Every Color of Light: A Book about the Sky</em></strong></a> (<a href=\"https://www.worldcat.org/title/every-color-of-light-a-book-about-the-sky/oclc/1125003118&#038;referer=brief_results\" target=\"_blank\"><em>public library</em></a>), translated by David Boyd &#8212; a tender serenade to the elements that unspools into a lullaby, inviting ecstatic wakefulness to the fulness of life, inviting a serene surrender to slumber. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Every-Color-Light-Book-about/dp/1592702910/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/everycoloroflight27.jpg?resize=680%2C453&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"453\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>Born in Fukushima just as World War II was breaking out, Osada composed this spare, lyrical book upon turning eighty, having lived through unimaginable storms. I can&#8217;t help but read it in consonance with Pico Iyer&#8217;s soulful meditation on <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2019/10/11/autumn-light-pico-iyer/\">autumn light and finding beauty in impermanence</a>, drawn from his many years in Japan. Arai&#8217;s almost synesthetic art &#8212; radiating more than color, radiating sound, a kind of buzzing aliveness &#8212; only amplifies this sense of consolation in the drama of the elements, this sense of change as a portal not to terror but to transcendent serenity. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Every-Color-Light-Book-about/dp/1592702910/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/EveryColorOFLight1.jpg?resize=680%2C453&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"453\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-71738\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/EveryColorOFLight1.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/EveryColorOFLight1.jpg?resize=240%2C160&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/EveryColorOFLight1.jpg?resize=320%2C213&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/EveryColorOFLight1.jpg?resize=768%2C511&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/EveryColorOFLight1.jpg?resize=600%2C400&#38;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>The story traces the symphonic movements of a storm.
