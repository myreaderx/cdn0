Back in the day the App Store would showcase the same games for a week, and then refresh those features each Thursday. Because of that developers got into the habit of releasing their games throughout Wednesday or very early Thursday in order to hopefully get one of those coveted features spots. Nowadays the App Store refreshes constantly, so the need for everyone to release all on the same day has diminished. Still, we’ve kept our weekly Wednesday night format as for years that’s the time people knew to check TouchArcade for the list of new games. And so without further ado please check out the full list of this week’s new games below, and let us know in the comments section which games you’ll be picking up!</p> \n<hr> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<p><b><font size=\"+2\">Arrog <a href=\"http://toucharcade.com/link/http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id1499642327?mt=8\">($1.99)</a></font></b></p> \n<p></p>\n<center>\n <img src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/626x0w-8-3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270075\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/626x0w-8-3.png 626w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/626x0w-8-3-300x138.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 626px) 100vw, 626px\">\n</center>\n<p></p> \n<p><strong>iTunes Description</strong></p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>Help a man travel through his dreams, as he must learn to accept his own death.</p> \n <p>Arrog is an enigmatic puzzle adventure game featuring hand-drawn art and set in a black-and-white world with color accents.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p><strong>Forum Thread:</strong> <a href=\"https://toucharcade.com/community/threads/arrog-by-hermanos-magia-leap-game-studios-playdigious.410194/\">Arrog (by Hermanos Magia, LEAP Game Studios, Playdigious)</a></p> \n<p></p> \n<hr> \n<p><b><font size=\"+2\">Ball Posse <a href=\"http://toucharcade.com/link/http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id1521699005?mt=8\">(Free)</a></font></b></p> \n<p></p>\n<center>\n <img src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/626x0w-4-3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270067\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/626x0w-4-3.png 626w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/626x0w-4-3-300x138.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 626px) 100vw, 626px\">\n</center>\n<p></p> \n<p><strong>iTunes Description</strong></p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>Ball Posse is a new puzzle platform video game where you tilt your way through super breathtaking challenging levels.</p> \n <p>Run and roll with our hero in a ball to avoid obstacles and collect unique Ball Posse gems.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p><strong>Forum Thread:</strong> <a href=\"https://toucharcade.com/community/threads/ball-posse-by-zypong.410151/\">Ball Posse (by Zypong)</a></p> \n<p></p> \n<hr> \n<p><b><font size=\"+2\">Chameleon: Color Doubt <a href=\"http://toucharcade.com/link/http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id1507588527?mt=8\">(Free)</a></font></b></p> \n<p></p>\n<center>\n <img src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/460x0w-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270068\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/460x0w-1.jpg 460w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/460x0w-1-139x300.jpg 139w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px\">\n</center>\n<p></p> \n<p><strong>iTunes Description</strong></p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>Do you want to try how long you can keep your brain under control?

For those unaware, <em>GWENT</em> is a minigame in <em>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</em> that garnered a ton of fans alongside that release and that led to a full game being built around it. I played a bit of <em>Thronebreaker: The Witcher Tales</em> on Xbox One when it arrived there and enjoyed my time with it but felt like it would be better experienced on <a href=\"https://toucharcade.com/2020/01/29/switcharcade-round-up-mini-views-including-to-the-moon-thronebreaker-the-witcher-tales-and-todays-other-new-releases-sales-and-more/\">Nintendo Switch</a>.

As queen, you are immediately tasked with dealing with an invasion and are thrown directly into the action. The story is full of well written characters, superb voice acting, and choices you will make that have actual consequences. I already expected the story here to be great but this is one of the few games to actually get decision making down. If you do ever think you want to just experience this for the story and not be interrupted by battles and puzzles, you can always skip battles on the easy mode.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/9A254A1A-45C7-4C26-8A89-F0A29468579E.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1792\" height=\"828\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-270112\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/9A254A1A-45C7-4C26-8A89-F0A29468579E.png 1792w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/9A254A1A-45C7-4C26-8A89-F0A29468579E-300x139.png 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/9A254A1A-45C7-4C26-8A89-F0A29468579E-768x355.png 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/9A254A1A-45C7-4C26-8A89-F0A29468579E-1024x473.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p>Adventure games are usually fairly short on mobile. <em>Thronebreaker: The Witcher Tales</em> on the other hand is around 28 to 30 hours long and can be shorter or longer depending on difficulty. <em>Gwent</em> veterans are better off on higher difficulties while people who aren’t interested in <em>Gwent</em> can even opt for the lowest setting that lets you skip <em>Gwent</em> encounters. It is great to see accessibility options like this in long games.</p> \n<p>The core gameplay in <em>Thronebreaker: The Witcher Tales</em> involves exploring, gathering resources, talking to people, and both puzzles and combat that involve <em>Gwent</em>. Resources can be gathered by tapping and holding when near a point of interest. There’s also a camp menu that lets you upgrade, work on your deck, recruit, and more. I was very impressed by the locations you explore here. The tap and hold for gathering resources got tiring though. As an introduction to <em>Gwent’s</em> mechanics, this does a decent job with explanations initially but it isn’t great and you will need to spend time learning and practicing on your own. It doesn’t help that the balance is very different across <em>Thronebreaker</em> (solo experience) and <em>Gwent</em> itself (multiplayer balance).</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/54EF650F-4376-42A3-B6B4-3DD93F091A0B.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1792\" height=\"828\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-270110\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/54EF650F-4376-42A3-B6B4-3DD93F091A0B.png 1792w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/54EF650F-4376-42A3-B6B4-3DD93F091A0B-300x139.png 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/54EF650F-4376-42A3-B6B4-3DD93F091A0B-768x355.png 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/54EF650F-4376-42A3-B6B4-3DD93F091A0B-1024x473.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p>As with other reviews I’ve done for ports that are also on other systems, I’ve tried <em>Thronebreaker: The Witcher Tales</em> on Xbox One X and PC in addition to iOS to compare how the game fares across different hardware when it comes to visuals, performance, and control options.</p> \n<p>When a game that is consoles and PC arrives on mobile, one would hope that all control options will be supported because mobile is almost as flexible as PC when it comes to inputs. <em>Thronebreaker: The Witcher Tales</em> has controller support on PC in addition to keyboard and mouse support. On iOS, it only has touch controls. I tried an Xbox One controller and a Steelseries Nimbus and had no luck with controller support. The touch controls work really well on iPad and almost as well on iPhone but controller support would’ve been good since the game already supports it on other systems. It is great to see haptic feedback supported though.</p> \n<p>Being able to sync progress between PC and mobile through both GOG and Steam is something more games need to do but the implementation here leaves a lot to be desired. For GOG, once you sign in, you can sync progress but need to enter your password if you want to sync it again. For Steam, you need to login completely each time you want to sync which is very annoying. I thought this would be as seamless as syncing progress between PC and Nintendo Switch for <em>The Witcher 3</em> but this is far from as well done.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/18743486-C553-4472-8DAC-B06A9C177266.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1792\" height=\"828\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-270114\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/18743486-C553-4472-8DAC-B06A9C177266.png 1792w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/18743486-C553-4472-8DAC-B06A9C177266-300x139.png 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/18743486-C553-4472-8DAC-B06A9C177266-768x355.png 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/18743486-C553-4472-8DAC-B06A9C177266-1024x473.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p>When it comes to visuals, <em>Thronebreaker: The Witcher Tales</em> has a very stylised look. It brings a combination of point and click movement in an isometric setting, visual novel styled segments, cutscenes, and of course <em>Gwent</em>. For a game that brings so many different visual perspectives, it nails the aesthetic. Everything from the interface to the actual card battles and movement look great on my iPhone 11. On iPad Air 2 and iPad Pro, I noticed some assets were much lower resolution than they should be. The loading screens that have cards displayed are noticeably blurry compared to the actual gameplay that is clean.</p> \n<p>Performance has been erratic on iPad as well but I’m not surprised about this given the random frame drops I experienced with my time on Xbox One X where it targets 60fps. On iPhone 11 and the two iPads I played on, <em>Thronebreaker: The Witcher Tales</em> targets 30fps and mostly holds that. On iPhone 11, my experience has been just about perfect barring some interface elements being a bit too small. On an iPad where everything scales better, performance is less than ideal on both iPad Air 2 (expected) and the first generation iPad Pro (disappointing).</p> \n<p>The game has a graphics options menu that you can play around with as well with options for graphics quality, vsync, anti aliasing, and animations for premium cards. This didn’t help me at all with trying to make the game run smooth on the first generation iPad Pro.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/6C556347-A10F-44C6-845B-C41144614BFB.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1536\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-270108\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/6C556347-A10F-44C6-845B-C41144614BFB.png 2048w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/6C556347-A10F-44C6-845B-C41144614BFB-300x225.png 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/6C556347-A10F-44C6-845B-C41144614BFB-768x576.png 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/6C556347-A10F-44C6-845B-C41144614BFB-1024x768.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p><em>Thronebreaker: The Witcher Tales</em> has excellent music and superb voice acting. The production values in this release are very high in general but the audio is brilliant across the board. This has more voice acting than many AAA games I’ve played. While there are some familiar tunes from <em><a href=\"https://toucharcade.com/2019/12/24/switcharcade-the-best-nintendo-switch-ports-of-2019/\">The Witcher 3</a></em>, the original score for <em>Thronebreaker: The Witcher Tales</em> is well worth a listen on its own as well. This is definitely on my list for the best soundtracks of the year on iOS.</p> \n<p>In its current state, the biggest issues with <em>Thronebreaker: The Witcher Tales</em> on iOS are in its visuals and performance on my iPads, the non seamless cloud save support, and lack of controller support. Depending on how much those aspects impact your experience in games, your overall enjoyment in this excellent story might change. If you’re just looking into this for a card game, I would recommend looking elsewhere though. <em>Gwent</em> is fun but this game is more about the story and the world than just <em>Gwent</em>. I also feel like newcomers to <em>Gwent</em> might have a hard time understanding the mechanics here without some trial and error that might feel annoying. Other card games do a better job with tutorials.</p> \n<p> </p>\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div> \n<div class=\"video-responsive\"> \n <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/W6rShIgad0s\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</div> \n<p></p> \n<p>Overall, <em>Thronebreaker: The Witcher Tales</em> on iOS is an essential for any fans of <em>The Witcher 3</em> and <em>Gwent</em>. If you don’t like card games but enjoy the world of CD Projekt Red’s <em>Witcher</em> the storytelling here will more than make up for that. You can even play on a lower difficulty to skip encounters if you just want to experience the story and world. The writing and story are strong enough to even make this worth it for those who don’t know anything about <em>The Witcher</em> since this is a standalone experience. With a few fixes and improvements, the iOS version of <em>Thronebreaker: The Witcher Tales</em> can easily be the best way to play it. </p> \n<p></p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 23 Jul 2020 22:57:11 +0000","feedId":84,"bgimg":"https://toucharcade.com/wp-content/images/app/1499205535/100x100bb.jpg","linkMd5":"6a4161bfb3919abeaa655b2b9e367fc5","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://toucharcade.com/wp-content/images/app/1499205535/100x100bb.jpg":null,"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/9A254A1A-45C7-4C26-8A89-F0A29468579E.png":null,"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/54EF650F-4376-42A3-B6B4-3DD93F091A0B.png":null,"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/18743486-C553-4472-8DAC-B06A9C177266.png":null,"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/6C556347-A10F-44C6-845B-C41144614BFB.png":null}},{"createdTime":"2020-07-25 01:03:48","updatedTime":"2020-07-24 17:03:48","title":"‘Dead by Daylight Mobile’ Gets New Training Mode in Latest Update","link":"https://toucharcade.com/?p=270127","description":"<p>After being officially announced in June of last year, and then spending some time in soft-launch in other parts of the world, Behaviour Interactive finally launched the mobile version of their popular asymmetric multiplayer survival game <em>Dead By Daylight</em> worldwide on both iOS and Android <a href=\"https://toucharcade.com/2020/04/16/dead-by-daylight-mobile-download-available-now-ios-android-free/\">this past April</a>. The game features up to five players with one of those players playing as a maniacal killer and the other four players playing as survivors who are trying to escape the map and NOT get killed in the process. Basically it’s like a horror movie simulator, and as such <em>Dead By Daylight</em> has featured numerous cameo appearances from some of the horror movie genre’s most famous killers, like Leatherface from Texas Chainsaw Massacre or Michael Myers from Halloween. The mobile version of <em>Dead by Daylight</em> has proven very popular since its release in April with more than 7 million downloads so far, and today Behaviour has just released a new update featuring a brand new and often requested Training Mode. Here’s a quick breakdown of how it works:</p> \n<p> </p>\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div> \n<div class=\"video-responsive\"> \n <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/eS63gCowZEk\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</div> \n<p></p> \n<p>I have to admit that training type modes are totally made for me. I am the exact sort of person who feels all self-conscious trying to learn a competitive multiplayer game like <em>Dead by Daylight</em> against actual real life players. Of course nothing can compare with playing against actual people, but I’d much prefer getting my bearings and learning some of the basics of a game against a bunch of bots before hopping online to get my ass kicked by real people. That’s pretty much exactly what this new Training Mode does. What’s really nice is that although it’s less than you’d earn in actual online games, you still can earn some experience playing against the bots, and they’ll adjust their difficulty level based on your rank so in theory their challenge level will scale with your skills. This update also adds a bunch of new costumes for the characters in the game too, so if feeling like a noob has kept you from really diving into <em>Dead by Daylight</em> on mobile this new Training Mode is calling your name.</p> \n<p></p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 23 Jul 2020 21:39:58 +0000","feedId":84,"bgimg":"https://toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dbdfeat.jpeg","linkMd5":"50601a8c55a2e09f0612f3a853e00555","metaImg":"https://toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dbdfeat.jpeg"},{"createdTime":"2020-07-25 01:03:46","updatedTime":"2020-07-24 17:03:46","title":"SwitchArcade Round-Up: ‘Fantasy Strike’ Goes Free-to-Play, ‘Rock of Ages 3’ and Today’s Other New Releases, the Latest Sales, and More","link":"https://toucharcade.com/?p=270029","description":"<p>Hello gentle readers, and welcome to the SwitchArcade Round-Up for July 22nd, 2020.

Let’s dance!</p> \n<h3><strong>News</strong></h3> \n<p><strong>This Week’s ‘Super Smash Bros.’ Event Takes a Step Back</strong></p> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270030\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/smashevent4wiiu3ds.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"960\" height=\"540\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/smashevent4wiiu3ds.jpg 960w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/smashevent4wiiu3ds-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/smashevent4wiiu3ds-768x432.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p>Well, here’s an odd theme for an event. This weekend’s <em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</em> event has been announced, and it will apparently celebrate <em>Super Smash Bros. For Wii U/3DS</em>, the previous chapter in the series. It’s a tournament event where only characters from those games can participate. Snake and Ice Climbers over in the corner having a good cry, then. Anyway, it kicks off on Friday and runs for three days through the weekend. You… should be able to find a character you’re comfortable with, I expect.</p> \n<p><strong>‘Update of Plenty’ is Now Available for ‘Dead Cells’</strong></p> \n<p> </p>\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div> \n<div class=\"video-responsive\"> \n <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/aGSBfC0cQ7U\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</div> \n<p></p> \n<p>The latest update for<em> Dead Cells</em> has finally been made available for the Switch version of the game. Update of Plenty includes some major changes to weapons, items, and the overall game economy. Scrolls have been removed from ++ and S weapons, and made more plentiful on early biomes. Enemy damage has been reduced, and gear damage has been increased. The overall game difficulty curve has seen some changes aimed at making it a slightly smoother ramp up in attempt to avoid the spikes that would sometimes occur. Check out the video above if you want to get all of the details straight from the developer.</p> \n<p><strong>Accessible Fighter ‘Fantasy Strike’ Goes Free-to-Play</strong></p> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270031\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/fantasystrikef2p.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/fantasystrikef2p.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/fantasystrikef2p-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/fantasystrikef2p-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/fantasystrikef2p-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p>Remember <em>Fantasy Strike</em>? It was a one-on-one fighter with a lot of interesting ideas, but it seems like it didn’t quite take off as hoped, making online play a bit of a wasteland. Well, the game is now going free-to-play, at least as far as online matches are concerned. If you download the game, you’re able to play in casual and ranked matches online with the full roster of characters, including two new ones who just arrived today. Practice mode, solo matches against an AI opponent, and the daily challenges are also available for free.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-256153\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/fantasystrike2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/fantasystrike2.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/fantasystrike2-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/fantasystrike2-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/fantasystrike2-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p>If you want local versus play, online play with friends, boss rush mode, survival mode, and the arcade story mode, you’ll have to buy the Core Pack for $19.99. A Collector’s Pack with extra cosmetics and a one-year subscription to the new Fantasy+ service is also available, priced at $99.99. Fantasy+ costs $4.99 per month and gives a lot of benefits that I won’t be going into here. Existing owners are given access to the Founder’s Pack, which includes everything in the Core Pack plus a bunch of costume color sets. Will this be enough to save the game? Heck if I know.</p> \n<p><strong>‘Rocket League’ is Also Going Free-to-Play</strong></p> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-248255\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/rocketleague.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/rocketleague.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/rocketleague-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/rocketleague-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/rocketleague-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p>Haha, I’m sure this is all nothing to worry about. Why am I tugging my collar? <em>I’m</em> not tugging my collar, <em>you</em> are! Anyway, <em>Rocket League</em> will also be going free-to-play in the not-too-distant future. Later this summer, apparently. Anyone who owns the game prior to the shift will receive all <em>Rocket League</em>-branded DLC released so far for free, a title that shows the year you first started playing, a whole bunch of Common items upgraded to Legacy quality, a Golden Cosmos Boost, Dieci-Oro Wheels, and a Huntress Player Banner. Those who have played online prior to today’s announcement will also received a Faded Cosmos Boost. Those rewards will come when the game makes the move to free-to-play, so don’t go digging in your mailbox just yet. There are other details, but there are still a lot of things we don’t know yet. That news will trickle out over the next few weeks, I expect. Anyway, this should liven up the online player pool, if nothing else.</p> \n<h3><strong>New Releases</strong></h3> \n<h3><strong>Rock of Ages 3: Make &amp; Break ($29.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270032\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/rockofages3makeandbreak.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/rockofages3makeandbreak.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/rockofages3makeandbreak-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/rockofages3makeandbreak-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/rockofages3makeandbreak-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p><strong>SwitchArcade Highlight!</strong></p> \n<p>A rolling stone gathers no moss, they say. Well, by now the quirky premise behind ACE Team’s unique tower defense series has lost some of its novelty, but the quality backing that premise has never been higher. In this third game, you can now make your own levels and share them with other players, an idea that adds a fair bit of longevity to the experience even after you’ve finished the hilarious campaign. With plenty of modes to play, multiplayer support for up to four players, and a variety of fancy boulders to choose from, <em>Rock of Ages 3</em> is the biggest and boulder-est game in the series so far. I’ll have a review of this one sometime next week for those who want more details.</p> \n<h3><strong>UBERMOSH: BLACK ($1.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270033\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ubermoshblack.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ubermoshblack.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ubermoshblack-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ubermoshblack-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ubermoshblack-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p><strong>SwitchArcade Highlight!</strong></p> \n<p><em>UBERMOSH: OMEGA</em> found plenty of fans with its distinct style, tense action, and extremely low price. I don’t see any reason why its follow-up, <em>UBERMOSH: BLACK</em> won’t do the same. It’s a top-down twin-stick action with plenty of gore, primary colors, and close calls to enjoy. Make use of swords, guns, psionic powers, and anything else you can get a hold of in order to defeat your enemies. If you grab the game during its launch discount period, it costs only fifty cents, which is quite ridiculous. Definitely more of a short-burst type of game, but it does what it does very well.</p> \n<h3><strong>Creaks ($19.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270034\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/creaks.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/creaks.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/creaks-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/creaks-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/creaks-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p><strong>SwitchArcade Highlight!</strong></p> \n<p>Amanita is at it again with its latest puzzle adventure, <em>Creaks</em>. You may recall seeing this one on Apple Arcade, where it launched a week or two back. Well, this is the Switch version. It’s not substantially different in any way, so it’s still the same great game. The choice really comes down to whether you want to buy it outright here or, for the same price, subscribe to Apple Arcade for four months. That’s more than enough to beat this game and plenty of others. Whatever way you choose to go about playing it, I give this game a strong recommendation to all adventure game fans.</p> \n<h3><strong>Neverending Nightmares ($14.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270035\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/neverendingnightmares.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/neverendingnightmares.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/neverendingnightmares-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/neverendingnightmares-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/neverendingnightmares-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p>This is a psychological horror game inspired by its creator’s struggles with depression and OCD. Main character Thomas wakes up from a nightmare only to find that he is still in a dream. He must descend through the layers of the dream, dealing with manifestations of his inner demons. But what will he find when he wakes up? This game has been out on other platforms for a bit and the consensus seems to be that the story is very good and the gameplay is just so-so. It’s also apparently on the shorter side, for those of you who are concerned with runtimes. There are three different endings, offering a bit of replay value, though that first play is obviously going to be the most memorable.</p> \n<h3><strong>Cyber Complex ($14.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270036\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/cybercomplex.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/cybercomplex.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/cybercomplex-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/cybercomplex-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/cybercomplex-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p>This is a bit of tough one to wrap your biscuit around at first, but once you do it’s an interesting arcade-style strategy game. A little tower defense, a tiny dash of <em>Pac-Man</em>, and a healthy dose of idle tapper/clicker, all done up in a stylish package. It’s okay, though I’m not sure it has enough meat on its bones to keep me coming back. I’m also disappointed to see a game that debuted on other platforms a few years ago for ten bucks hit the Switch for fifteen, but when in Rome do as the Romans do, I suppose. The problem is that while I think this might be worth a punt at ten bucks, I really don’t feel it’s worth fifteen.</p> \n<h3><strong>Aircraft Evolution ($9.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270037\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/aircraftevolution.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/aircraftevolution.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/aircraftevolution-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/aircraftevolution-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/aircraftevolution-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p>While the name might have you expecting some kind of realistic flight simulator or something, this is actually a side-scrolling action game. It’s set across four different eras, which is part of where the ‘evolution’ bit of the title is drawn from. The other part is probably that you can upgrade your crafts to improve their stats. Anyway, you fly through 40 different missions battling enemy defenses and trying to take out bases and other targets. It looks fine for what it is, but I can see it getting old fast. I don’t really care for how much clutter there is on the screen most of the time, and it seems like you’re not really meant to dodge everything coming at you. Perhaps you might feel differently about it.</p> \n<h3><strong>Sales</strong></h3> \n<p><em><strong>(North American eShop, US Prices)</strong></em></p> \n<p>NIS America is running another sale on most of its titles, including excellent games like<em> Disgaea 5 Complete, The Alliance Alive HD Remastered</em>, and <em>Labyrinth of Refrain: Coven of Dusk</em>. 505 Games has put some of its titles on sale, which means you can get the likes of <em>Terraria</em> and <em>Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night</em> at a discount. Hey, <em>Indivisible</em> is on sale too. That’s cool. The outbox has a lot of the usual suspects in it, but take note of<em> Shakedown: Hawaii</em> and <em>Burnout Paradise Remastered</em>, which may or may not be on sale again anytime soon. Geez, Wednesdays don’t usually have so many tough decisions to make.</p> \n<p><strong>Select New Games on Sale</strong></p> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-259304\"

The hack and slash Warriors-style games from Koei Tecmo and Omega Force have been releasing on multiple systems over decades spreading out with multiple anime games like <em>One Piece Pirate Warriors</em> in addition to the mainline entries. Even Nintendo collaborated with them to bring out <em>Hyrule Warriors</em> and <em>Fire Emblem Warriors</em>. Other developers have tried their hand at the same style over the years with Marvelous’ <em>Fate/EXTELLA: The Umbral Star</em> being a similar styled action game set in the <em>Fate</em> universe. It was one of the better hack and slash games but the sequel <em>Fate/EXTELLA Link</em> saw gameplay improvements in every way. The games released across PS4, PS Vita, Nintendo Switch, and even PC over they ears inside and outside Japan. Watch the trailer for <em>Fate/EXTELLA: The Umbral Star</em> on mobile below:</p> \n<p> </p>\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div> \n<div class=\"video-responsive\"> \n <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hmd5HAWFOTk\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</div> \n<p></p> \n<p>Today, both games arrive on mobile <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FateEXTELLA/status/1285911017721958401\">in Japan</a> as premium ports. There were a few <em>Fate</em> announcements today but mobile ports of <em>Fate/EXTELLA: The Umbral Star</em> and <em>Fate/EXTELLA Link</em> being announced and released immediately is very surprising for me. I was following the news to see if a new console game was revealed but seeing two premium mobile ports of two of my favourite hack and slash games in recent years is something I didn’t expect. As of now, the release is only for Japan. <em>Fate/EXTELLA: The Umbral Star</em> and <em>Fate/EXTELLA Link</em> are now available on iOS and Android in Japan. Watch the trailer for <em>Fate/EXTELLA Link</em> on mobile below:</p> \n<p> </p>\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div> \n<div class=\"video-responsive\"> \n <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/AgVUQWDXuYg\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</div> \n<p></p> \n<p>A localisation for both games already exists thanks to Xseed Games. Hopefully Xseed Games and Marvelous can bring these over since we now have both ports and a localisation ready.

Today’s article is, as usual for a Thursday, largely concerned with the latest releases to hit the eShop. And friends, there are a lot of them. On top of that, there a bunch of sales to dig into including some very uncommon discounts on select titles from Hamster’s <em>Arcade Archives</em> series. There’s a lot to get through, so let’s commence with the action!</p> \n<h3><strong>New Releases</strong></h3> \n<h3><strong>Crysis Remastered ($29.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270089\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/crysisremastered.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/crysisremastered.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/crysisremastered-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/crysisremastered-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/crysisremastered-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p><strong>SwitchArcade Highlight!</strong></p> \n<p>The game that was once famous for putting even the mightiest of gaming PCs through its paces is now available on your Nintendo Switch. Well, kind of. This is apparently based on the version that was made for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, and though it does improve on those versions in general, it’s still a far cry from the beast that melted silicon. Expect variable resolutions that go as low as 540p, framerate dips into the upper-teens, and a few other hiccups here and there. But you know what? It’s <em>Crysis</em> running on a handheld, and it’s quite playable for the most part. That’s pretty neat. First-person shooter fans will probably buy this the minute it pops on the eShop, and I doubt they’ll be unhappy with it in spite of a few flaws.</p> \n<h3><strong>Carrion ($19.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270090\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/carrion.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/carrion.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/carrion-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/carrion-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/carrion-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p><strong>SwitchArcade Highlight!</strong></p> \n<p>The latest game from publisher Devolver Digital and developer Phobia Game Studio, <em>Carrion</em> turns the usual horror story on its head by casting you as the monster. You’re an amorphous, vaguely Eldritch creature of unknown origins that is wreaking havoc in a human facility. Stalk your targets and consume them to grow and evolve, becoming more powerful and unlocking new skills that will help you destroy this makeshift prison and help you earn your freedom. This is a very cool game, and I will definitely have a review for it early next week if you want more details.</p> \n<h3><strong>Fibbage XL ($9.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270091\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/fibbagexl.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/fibbagexl.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/fibbagexl-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/fibbagexl-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/fibbagexl-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p><strong>SwitchArcade Highlight!</strong></p> \n<p>The Jackbox people have put together this fun party game for up to eight players. Ha, eight players in one room. Not very safe right now, Mr. Cookie Masterson! Well, if you want to risk it, you’ll find a wild game of lies, bluffing, and telling the truth as insincerely as possible here. You can use your phone, tablet, or laptop as a controller, making it a bit easier to assemble the needed equipment for a full set of players. You basically need to trick other players into believing your lies while trying not to fall for theirs, kind of like that good old board game <em>Balderdash</em>. It’s all wrapped up in the kind of slick presentation we’ve come to expect from the Jackbox people, and yeah, it’s a hoot. It’s an easy recommendation to anyone hosting get-togethers.</p> \n<h3><strong>Quiplash ($9.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270092\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/quiplash.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/quiplash.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/quiplash-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/quiplash-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/quiplash-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p><strong>SwitchArcade Highlight!</strong></p> \n<p>And here’s another one from the Jackbox folks, and it’s another multiplayer party game meant for up to eight players in the same room. You’re given questions and sentences missing words and need to come up with your funniest answer. The players all vote for which one they like the best, and that’s pretty much how it goes. It features the sharp writing, strong sense of humor, and solid presentation that runs through all of Jackbox’s titles, so it’s another good choice for (adult) family game nights and social gatherings. Not much more I can add here, so if you like the idea of the game and have people to play it with, do what you will.</p> \n<h3><strong>Aeolis Tournament ($14.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270093\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/aeolistournament.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/aeolistournament.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/aeolistournament-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/aeolistournament-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/aeolistournament-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p>Wow, a multiplayer party game that actually has online support? That’s a rarity these days. Of course, there needs to be people online for that to be a terribly useful feature, but it’s still nice to see. Especially right now. Up to eight players can play this one. It’s a collection of mini-games that all use one-button gameplay, so it’s probably a good choice for less-skilled players. You’re using an air cannon to do a variety of tasks, more or less. It’s colorful, and I do like the idea of trying to build a bunch of activities around one central mechanic. Just not sure if it has what it takes to crack one of the most competitive categories on the Switch.</p> \n<h3><strong>Epic Word Search Collection 2 ($7.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270094\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/epicwordsearchcollection2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/epicwordsearchcollection2.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/epicwordsearchcollection2-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/epicwordsearchcollection2-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/epicwordsearchcollection2-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p>If you couldn’t get enough of word searches with the first <em>Epic Word Search Collection</em>, here comes the sequel! You get four different puzzles in this one: America, Monster, Rock, and Summer. I know what you’re thinking: only four? Okay, look: there are more than 1,500 words are hidden in each of these giant-sized grids. Like, it will probably take you longer to solve <em>one</em> of these four puzzles than it would take to complete a playthrough of <em>Dragon Quest 1</em>. Something to chew on over a long period of time, basically. It’s also a nice counter-point to the idea that you could just buy a real book of word search puzzles. Yes, you could <em>probably</em> get one of these monsters onto paper, but are you going to be the fool spreading out a 14,000 letter grid on the bus or train? Right.</p> \n<h3><strong>Tales from the Dragon Mountain: The Strix ($9.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270095\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/talesfromthedragonmountain.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/talesfromthedragonmountain.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/talesfromthedragonmountain-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/talesfromthedragonmountain-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/talesfromthedragonmountain-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p>Well, this is a bit awkward, isn’t it? This hidden-object adventure sees a young woman named Mina Lockheart on a quest to defeat an evil spirit called the Strix. But wait a second! The sequel hit the Switch just last week, so we already know that Mina is going to be unsuccessful at putting the Strix down permanently. <em>Spoilers much</em>, Publisher-<em>san</em>? Oh well. Enjoy the puzzles and, provided you haven’t played the sequel, the mysterious story as you work your way through some admittedly well-realized fantasy locations. While this isn’t my kind of game, the fact that it got a sequel means it must be decent for what it is.</p> \n<h3><strong>Brightstone Mysteries: Paranormal Hotel ($9.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270096\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/brightstonemysteriesparanormalhotel.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/brightstonemysteriesparanormalhotel.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/brightstonemysteriesparanormalhotel-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/brightstonemysteriesparanormalhotel-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/brightstonemysteriesparanormalhotel-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p>But wait, there’s more! Yes, this is another hidden-object adventure game from the same publisher and developer as <em>Tales from the Dragon Mountain</em>. An NYPD detective named Bridget Brightstone has for some reason been given the task of investigating a medieval castle that was converted into a luxury hotel. It’s apparently being used by an ancient Egyptian cult, and the fate of the entire world is at stake. Somehow you’ll be meeting Cleopatra, King Arthur, Marcus Antonius, and other historical figures as you unravel this mystery. Seems like there are some decent puzzles in here for those that dig this genre.</p> \n<h3><strong>Hunt ($9.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270097\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/hunt.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/hunt.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/hunt-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/hunt-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/hunt-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p>Aw heck, it’s Sabec. There are a lot of hunting video games of dubious value out there, but something tells me this may be the dubious-est. It claims to be a sandbox hunting simulator where you take down as many animals as you can in 15 minutes, so you’re probably looking at something in the shallower end of the pool here. You carry the standard equipment all hunters have with them on a hunt: a sniper rifle, a 9mm pistol, a shotgun, a revolver, and a gosh-darned semi-automatic machine gun. You can hunt at different times of day, and the exact size and color of the animals you hunt are randomly generated. It looks like complete junk as usual, but if it ever gets an absurd discount it might be worth it for some laughs.</p> \n<h3><strong>Checkers ($9.99)</strong></h3> \n<p>Aw heck, it’s Sabec. Part <strong><em>DEUX</em></strong>. Yes, there’s yet another undercooked effort available from our favorite <em>kusoge</em> provider today, and I don’t think it has nearly the potential for accidental hilarity that the other game does. It’s just checkers. Like, that’s it. Play against the AI (very smart, ask anyone, lots of people are saying it) or another human locally in one of the blandest board games ever created. Sabec has thrown in some different boards and pieces to try to liven things up, and the game description boasts that it features <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em><strong>STUNNING 3D GRAPHICS</strong></em></span>. Watch out, <em>Crysis</em>. So yes, I hate checkers as a game and this therefore wouldn’t be for me even if it was cheap and great, but it’s not really either of those things, is it? Ten bucks. You could just buy a <em>real</em> checkers set.</p> \n<h3><strong>GERRRMS ($9.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270098\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/gerrrms.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/gerrrms.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/gerrrms-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/gerrrms-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/gerrrms-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p>Hey, who needs another party game that only supports local multiplayer? <em>GERRRMS</em> allows up to four players to choose their favorite microbe, enter the biological arena, and battle it out. Multiple game modes offer a bit of variety to keep things fresh, particularly since each of them has a special power-up that you can make use of to give yourself the edge over your fellow microbes. Practicing safe social distancing and don’t have anyone to play with? Well, there is a single-player mode that the game <em>claims</em> will keep you entertained for hours, but I’m not so sure about that. Cute premise, and it seems like it would be amusing enough if you have people to play with.</p> \n<h3><strong>Sushi Reversi ($13.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270099\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sushireversi.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sushireversi.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sushireversi-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sushireversi-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sushireversi-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p>Uhhh… so this is a real-time take on <em>Reversi</em> featuring pieces of sushi battling it out for the right to place pieces on a variety of boards. As is the case with normal <em>Reversi</em>, the player who has the most pieces on the board at the end wins. There are special items, skills, and unique obstacles and challenges that make things even more hectic. Up to four players can join in via local multiplayer, and if you find yourself starved for content there are a number of extra content packs available as paid DLC. Weird stuff from top to bottom, really. But if you love sushi, <em>Reversi</em>, or both… today is your day, pal.</p> \n<h3><strong>Grisaia Phantom Trigger 03 ($14.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270100\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/grisaiaphantomtrigger03.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/grisaiaphantomtrigger03.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/grisaiaphantomtrigger03-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/grisaiaphantomtrigger03-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/grisaiaphantomtrigger03-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p>The first two chapters of<em> Grisaia Phantom Trigger</em> hit the Switch not too long ago, and now here’s the third chapter. This visual novel series follows a new generation of characters at the Mihama Academy. It goes without saying that you won’t want to play this one until you’ve done the first two chapters, as the story more or less picks up from where they left off. Some of the SORD members have traveled overseas and end up involved in a hunt for a SORD deserter. Tohka takes the spotlight in this chapter, and you’ll learn a whole lot about her complicated past and the struggles she’s dealing with as a result. There are no choices to make, so just enjoy the fully-voiced story and top-quality art at your own pace.</p> \n<h3><strong>Arcade Archives Koutetsu Yousai Strahl ($7.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270101\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/arcadearchiveskoutetsuyousaistrahl.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/arcadearchiveskoutetsuyousaistrahl.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/arcadearchiveskoutetsuyousaistrahl-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/arcadearchiveskoutetsuyousaistrahl-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/arcadearchiveskoutetsuyousaistrahl-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p>Hamster has dug deep into the UPL catalog that it owns and pulled out this 1992 horizontal shoot-em-up from the latter days of the publisher. Aside from its lengthy title, which translates to “<em>Steel Fortress Strahl</em>“, this game doesn’t really have many noteworthy features. Still, it’s a competent enough shoot-em-up with a few interesting stages and bosses to battle, and I doubt many of you have played it before. Perhaps that’s enough. Hamster has done its usual job here, ensuring the game is faithful for the few who remember it in its original form.</p> \n<h3><strong>Sales</strong></h3> \n<p><em><strong>(North American eShop, US Prices)</strong></em></p> \n<p>Some real rarities in today’s list already, and there may well be more by the time this article gets posted. First of all, Hamster has a number of its <em>Arcade Archives</em> titles discounted. A few of these have been on sale before, but some have not. <em>Metal Slug X</em> is the biggest one, but I believe <em>Puzzled</em> hasn’t been on sale before either. Another rare sale is the <em>KORG Gadget</em>, which is not a game but rather an excellent music creation tool. Not too much in the outbox, but do be sure to have a look through both lists to see if anything catches your eye.</p> \n<p><strong>Select New Games on Sale</strong></p> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270102\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/acaneogeometalslugx.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/acaneogeometalslugx.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/acaneogeometalslugx-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/acaneogeometalslugx-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/acaneogeometalslugx-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p><em><strong>ACA NEOGEO Metal Slug X</strong></em> ($3.99 from $7.99 until 8/5)<br> <em><strong>ACA NEOGEO Aero Fighters 2</strong> </em>($3.99 from $7.99 until 8/5)<br> <em><strong>ACA NEOGEO Puzzled</strong></em> ($3.99 from $7.99 until 8/5)<br> <em><strong>ACA NEOGEO Art of Fighting</strong></em> ($3.99 from $7.99 until 8/5)<br> <em><strong>ACA NEOGEO World Heroes</strong></em> ($3.99 from $7.99 until 8/5)<br> <em><strong>Arcade Archives Double Dragon</strong></em> ($3.99 from $7.99 until 8/5)<br> <em><strong>Arcade Archives Terra Cresta</strong> </em>($3.99 from $7.99 until 8/5)<br> <em><strong>Arcade Archives Kid’s Horehore</strong></em> ($3.99 from $7.99 until 8/5)<br> <em><strong>Arcade Archives Atomic Robo-Kid</strong> </em>($3.99 from $7.99 until 8/5)<br> <em><strong>Arcade Archives Armed F</strong></em> ($3.99 from $7.99 until 8/5)<br> <em><strong>Syberia</strong> </em>($4.99 from $14.99 until 8/5)<br> <em><strong>KORG Gadget</strong></em> ($33.60 from $48.00 until 8/11)<br> <em><strong>Super Chariot</strong></em> ($1.49 from $14.99 until 7/31)<br> <em><strong>High Noon Revolver</strong></em> ($0.29 from $2.99 until 8/6)<br> <em><strong>8-Ball Pocket</strong></em> ($1.97 from $5.99 until 8/11)</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-266053\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/grandguilds.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/grandguilds.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/grandguilds-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/grandguilds-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/grandguilds-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"><br> <em><strong>Grand Guilds</strong></em> ($16.99 from $19.99 until 8/6)<br> <em><strong>Towertale</strong> </em>($6.99 from $9.99 until 8/6)<br> <em><strong>Adventures of Bertram Fiddle: Ep. 1</strong> </em>($0.99 from $4.99 until 8/13)<br> <em><strong>Adventures of Bertram Fiddle: Ep. 2</strong></em> ($3.99 from $9.99 until 8/13)<br> <em><strong>Urban Trial Playground</strong> </em>($4.49 from $14.99 until 8/13)<br> <em><strong>Pirates: All Aboard!</strong> </em>($0.49 from $5.99 until 8/13)<br> <em><strong>Dream Alone</strong></em> ($0.99 from $9.99 until 8/13)<br> <em><strong>The VideoKid</strong> </em>($0.99 from $4.99 until 8/13)<br> <em><strong>Exorder</strong> </em>($1.29 from $12.99 until 8/13)<br> <em><strong>Kingdom Two Crowns</strong></em> ($13.99 from $19.99 until 8/4)<br> <em><strong>Cyber Protocol</strong></em> ($1.09 from $9.99 until 7/30)<br> <em><strong>Rawr-Off</strong></em> ($0.29 from $2.99 until 8/13)<br> <em><strong>Nonograms Prophecy</strong> </em>($1.19 from $3.99 until 8/13)<br> <em><strong>Strike Force Kitty</strong></em> ($2.49 from $4.99 until 8/13)<br> <em><strong>Defenders of Ekron: Definitive</strong></em> ($6.99 from $13.99 until 8/13)</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-262734\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/clumsyrush.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/clumsyrush.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/clumsyrush-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/clumsyrush-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/clumsyrush-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"><br> <em><strong>Clumsy Rush</strong></em> ($1.04 from $4.99 until 7/30)<br> <em><strong>Refreshing Sideways Puzzle Ghost Hammer</strong></em> ($22.39 from $27.99 until 8/13)<br> <em><strong>Sisters Royale: Five Sisters Under Fire</strong></em> ($6.99 from $13.99 until 8/13)<br> <em><strong>Ego Protocol: Remastered</strong></em> ($1.99 from $4.99 until 8/12)<br> <em><strong>R.B.I.

I hope you all have a great Thursday, and as always, thanks for reading!</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 23 Jul 2020 18:29:06 +0000","feedId":84,"bgimg":"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/crysisremastered.jpg","linkMd5":"e8265664f728c906f2823bd1c699ed2e","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/crysisremastered.jpg":null,"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/carrion.jpg":null,"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/fibbagexl.jpg":null,"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/quiplash.jpg":null,"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/aeolistournament.jpg":null,"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/epicwordsearchcollection2.jpg":null,"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/talesfromthedragonmountain.jpg":null,"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/brightstonemysteriesparanormalhotel.jpg":null,"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/hunt.jpg":null,"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/gerrrms.jpg":null,"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sushireversi.jpg":null,"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/grisaiaphantomtrigger03.jpg":null,"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/arcadearchiveskoutetsuyousaistrahl.jpg":null,"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/acaneogeometalslugx.jpg":null,"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/grandguilds.jpg":null,"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/clumsyrush.jpg":null,"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/funtime.jpg":null}},{"createdTime":"2020-07-25 01:03:46","updatedTime":"2020-07-24 17:03:46","title":"‘Romancing SaGa 2’ from Square Enix Gets a Massive Discount for a Limited Time Bringing It from $17.99 to Just $2.99","link":"https://toucharcade.com/?p=270155","description":"<p><a class=\"app-icon\" href=\"/games/romancing-saga-2\" style=\"float:left; margin-top:4px; margin-right:10px;\"><img style=\"border-radius:20px;\" src=\"https://toucharcade.com/wp-content/images/app/1083835330/100x100bb.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a> A few years ago, Square Enix localised and brought <em>Romancing SaGa 2</em> <a href=\"http://toucharcade.com/link/http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id1083835330?mt=8\">($2.99)</a> to the West for the first time through an iOS and Android release. This was the first time the game was released in English after it released in Japan back in 1993. Square Enix has rarely discounted the <em>SaGa</em> games on any platform while the <em>Final Fantasy</em> games see more regular discounts. Today, Square Enix is celebrating the 30th anniversary of the SaGa series with a massive discount for <em>Romancing SaGa 2</em>. <em>Romancing SaGa 2</em> is priced at $17.99 usually and it is $2.99 for a limited time on both iOS and Android. Watch the trailer for it below:</p> \n<p> </p>\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div> \n<div class=\"video-responsive\"> \n <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wWbp20lYLko\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</div> \n<p></p> \n<p>I usually try and write about discounts when there are multiple games celebrating an event or for a rare discount. Today’s <em>Romancing SaGa 2</em> discount is unlike Square Enix because the <em>SaGa</em> and <em>Dragon Quest</em> games rarely get good discounts let alone discounts on this level on any platform digitally. The discount is available until August 2nd. Read Shaun’s review of <em>Romancing SaGa 2</em> <a href=\"https://toucharcade.com/2016/06/03/romancing-saga-2-review/\">here</a>.
