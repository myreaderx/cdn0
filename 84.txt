In today’s article, we’ve got news on the incoming update for <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em>, details on the latest <em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</em> event, a review of the Genki Covert Dock from Human Things, summaries of three cool new releases, and the usual lists of new and outgoing sales. Not too bad for a Wednesday! Let’s get marching!</p> \n<h3><strong>News</strong></h3> \n<p><strong>‘Animal Crossing: New Horizons’ Summer Update Wave 2 Hits Tomorrow</strong></p> \n<p> </p>\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div> \n<div class=\"video-responsive\"> \n <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/InDJvcWtTCw\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</div> \n<p></p> \n<p>The next big update for <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em> is about to arrive, and it brings the promised second wave of summer content to the game. There’s plenty in here, starting off with fireworks shows every Sunday in the month of August. It’s going to have to serve as a replacement for the real thing for folks in Japan, as the pandemic has resulted in the cancellation of all such events this year. You can even make your own custom fireworks! Neato. Luna makes her return in this update as well, offering you the ability to visit Dream Islands, where you can mess around to your heart’s content because nothing in the Dream World affects the real world. Finally, and this is a big one, Nintendo Switch Online subscribers will now be able to backup and restore their islands in case something goes wrong with your Switch. Another update later this year will grant the ability to move data to another system, so don’t go too wild just yet. Summer Update Wave 2 hits tomorrow.</p> \n<p><strong>Feeling Blue?

Like any other Wednesday, really. Tomorrow is a special Thursday, but this Wednesday? Plain-old, plain-old. And that means we’ve got the details of this weekend’s<em> Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</em> event. This time around we’ve got another Spirit Board event, and the theme is “Blue\". Like the ocean, I suppose. Or the skies? Not here, lately. Gray every day. Anyway, you’ll be facing off against blue Spirits, and you’ll earn more Gold than usual for doing so.</p> \n<h3><strong>Reviews</strong></h3> \n<h3><strong>Genki Covert Dock ($74.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270250\" src=\"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270247\" alt=\"\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1440\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/genkicovertdock1.jpg 2048w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/genkicovertdock1-300x211.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/genkicovertdock1-768x540.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/genkicovertdock1-1024x720.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p>As regular readers may know, I tend to play my Switch in handheld mode almost exclusively. It fits my lifestyle better, but the other reason I do that is because the dock that came with my system was defective. I wasn’t able to get it replaced under warranty for various reasons, and in times where I really needed a dock I was able to borrow my son’s. Still, I’ve kept an eye open all this time for a suitable replacement. Preferably one that fit my on-the-go routine, because that original dock was a bit cumbersome to carry around.</p> \n<p>Well, I think I’ve got what I was looking for: the <a href=\"https://www.genkithings.com/products/covert-dock-preorder\">Genki Covert Dock</a>. After a successful Kickstarter campaign a while ago, the Covert Dock has been available in limited markets for several months but will finally be ready for its global debut on July 31st. The nice folks at Human Things sent one over for review purposes and I’ve been putting it through its paces with some rigorous testing. I’m happy to report that it does exactly what it purports to, and that’s great news for anyone looking for a more portable replacement for their Switch dock.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270251\" src=\"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270247\" alt=\"\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1156\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/genkicovertdock2.jpg 2048w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/genkicovertdock2-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/genkicovertdock2-768x434.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/genkicovertdock2-1024x578.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p>Inside the rather compact cube of a box, you get the Covert Dock, a set of global adapters in case you’re traveling, a USB Type-C 3.1 cable (6 feet long), a multi-language manual, and a weird sticker. The Covert Dock is very small, easily pocketable and impressively light. You can fold the prongs in, making it into a little rectangular cube smaller than the Switch’s own power brick. When plugged into an outlet, it leaves plenty of space for neighboring outlets to be used. There are three ports on it: an HDMI port to connect it to your display, a USB-A port that you can use for a controller or whatever, and a USB-C port to connect it to your Switch.</p> \n<p>So yeah, plug it into an outlet, connect an HDMI cable from your display, plug the included USB-C cable into the Covert Dock and your Switch, and boom, you’re all set. Your Switch will behave like it’s docked and you can enjoy all the benefits of such. It works just like the real thing, and I’ve had zero problems with any flickering images, weird audio, or anything like that. One concern I had was with regards to heat, so I played a lot of games that make the Switch cry over lengthy periods of time. I wouldn’t wrap the Switch in a blanket or anything, but while it got hot on games like <em>The Witcher 3</em>, it never became distressingly so.</p> \n<p> </p>\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div> \n<div class=\"video-responsive\"> \n <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/U6mFOR8_utc\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</div> \n<p></p> \n<p>There’s not much more I can say about the Genki Covert Dock, and I think when it comes to this kind of accessory that’s a good thing. It works just the way you would hope, and provides exactly the functionality you would expect it to. It’s a dock you can throw in your bag or pocket, making it perfect for those who travel between multiple locations on a regular basis. Even something as simple as wanting to play your Switch in different rooms in the same house is a lot easier with this little fellow. It’s also a great replacement for Nintendo’s own dock if you need one for whatever reason.</p> \n<p><strong>SwitchArcade Score: 5/5</strong></p> \n<h3><strong>New Releases</strong></h3> \n<h3><strong>Samurai Shodown NEOGEO Collection ($39.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270253\" src=\"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270247\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/samuraishodownneogeocollection.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/samuraishodownneogeocollection-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/samuraishodownneogeocollection-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/samuraishodownneogeocollection-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p><strong>SwitchArcade Highlight!</strong></p> \n<p>The latest collection handled by the folks at Digital Eclipse is <em>Samurai Shodown NEOGEO Collection</em>, which is pretty much what it says on the tin. You get all of the NEOGEO <em>Samurai Shodown</em> fighting games: <em>Samurai Shodown, Samurai Shodown II, Samurai Shodown III, Samurai Shodown IV Amakusa’s Revenge, Samurai Shodown V</em>, and<em> Samurai Shodown V Special</em>. It also includes a heretofore unreleased extra edition of<em> Samurai Shodown V, Samurai Shodown V Perfect</em>. All of the included games feature both the English and Japanese MVS versions, and the English versions can be played online. All of the usual Digital Eclipse options and extras are here, including an extensive Museum Mode filled with a ridiculous amount of historical content and a Sound Player with more than 200 tracks. All that for less than the price of buying the <em>ACA NEOGEO</em> versions of the games. Very nice.</p> \n<h3><strong>They Breathe ($3.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270255\" src=\"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270247\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/theybreathe.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/theybreathe-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/theybreathe-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/theybreathe-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p><strong>SwitchArcade Highlight!</strong></p> \n<p>Making its way over from mobile and a PC port, <em>They Breathe</em> is a half-hour long game about a frog descending into the depths and facing the horrors within. You’ll need to manage your air supply by grabbing air bubbles and deal with a variety of creatures with their own behaviors and patterns. Naturally, there’s a story to be told here. I don’t think this Switch version offers anything particularly important over the mobile version, but you get buttons and the ability to put it on your big screen for only a couple of bucks more. Wherever you opt to play it, this brief experience is one worth taking.</p> \n<h3><strong>Heroes of Hammerwatch – Ultimate Edition ($19.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270256\" src=\"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270247\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/heroesofhammerwatchultimate.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/heroesofhammerwatchultimate-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/heroesofhammerwatchultimate-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/heroesofhammerwatchultimate-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p><strong>SwitchArcade Highlight!</strong></p> \n<p>Gosh, what a day for releases. Yes, I’m giving this one a SwitchArcade Highlight! as well. It’s a fun hack and slash roguelite with plenty of loot and secrets to seek out, and this Switch version includes all of the DLC for the PC version making it a slightly better deal. Now that’s rare. Up to four players can get in on this one via online play. A nice thing about this game is that your heroes retain all of their experience from each run, so even the unluckiest of players should eventually be able to make progress. Quite a bit of fun when you play it solo, and an absolute blast if you can get some friends to play with you.</p> \n<h3><strong>Sales</strong></h3> \n<p><em><strong>(North American eShop, US Prices)</strong></em></p> \n<p>Like most Wednesdays, there isn’t too much to worry about in today’s list. <em>Megadimension Neptunia VII</em> has a nice launch sale going on, <em>Legends of Amberland</em> remains enjoyable at any price, and <em>Vasara Collection</em> is easily worth the buck it’s going for. Make sure you check the outbox carefully, however, as there are a lot of good games in there that don’t go on sale often. Games like<em> SUPERHOT, Oddworld: Stranger’s Wrath</em>, and <em>Celeste</em> are all fine additions to any growing backlog. Maybe you can even play them sometime!</p> \n<p><strong>Select New Games on Sale</strong></p> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270218\" src=\"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270247\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/megadimensionneptuniavii.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/megadimensionneptuniavii-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/megadimensionneptuniavii-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/megadimensionneptuniavii-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p><em><strong>Megadimension Neptunia VII</strong></em> ($23.99 from $29.99 until 8/18)<br> <em><strong>Pixel Action Heroes</strong> </em>($3.74 from $4.99 until 8/16)<br> <em><strong>Ludomania</strong> </em>($0.40 from $4.00 until 8/17)<br> <em><strong>The Office Quest</strong></em> ($2.39 from $11.99 until 8/11)<br> <em><strong>Color Zen Kids</strong></em> ($2.99 from $3.99 until 8/16)<br> <em><strong>Flowlines VS</strong></em> ($0.49 from $4.99 until 8/17)<br> <em><strong>Food Truck Tycoon</strong></em> ($1.99 from $4.99 unil 8/17)<br> <em><strong>Street Basketball</strong></em> ($1.19 from $5.99 until 8/17)<br> <em><strong>Real Drift Racing</strong></em> ($0.49 from $4.99 until 8/17)<br> <em><strong>Bubble Cats Rescue</strong></em> ($0.39 from $3.99 until 8/17)<br> <em><strong>Adrenaline Rush – Miami Drive</strong></em> ($0.39 from $3.99 until 8/17)<br> <em><strong>Vasara Collection</strong></em> ($0.99 from $9.99 until 8/17)<br> <em><strong>Pet Shop Snacks</strong></em> ($0.99 from $4.99 until 8/17)<br> <em><strong>Tower Climb</strong></em> ($1.20 from $6.00 until 8/11)<br> <em><strong>Perseverance</strong> </em>($0.99 from $4.99 until 8/18)</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-261290\" src=\"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270247\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/gofishgo.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/gofishgo-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/gofishgo-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/gofishgo-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"><br> <em><strong>Go!

Back in the day the App Store would showcase the same games for a week, and then refresh those features each Thursday. Because of that developers got into the habit of releasing their games throughout Wednesday or very early Thursday in order to hopefully get one of those coveted features spots. Nowadays the App Store refreshes constantly, so the need for everyone to release all on the same day has diminished. Still, we’ve kept our weekly Wednesday night format as for years that’s the time people knew to check TouchArcade for the list of new games. And so without further ado please check out the full list of this week’s new games below, and let us know in the comments section which games you’ll be picking up!</p> \n<hr> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<p><b><font size=\"+2\">Aggretsuko: The Short Timer Strikes Back <a href=\"http://toucharcade.com/link/http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id1516629235?mt=8\">(Free)</a></font></b></p> \n<p></p>\n<center>\n <img src=\"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270273\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270296\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/626x0w-6-2.jpg 626w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/626x0w-6-2-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 626px) 100vw, 626px\">\n</center>\n<p></p> \n<p><strong>iTunes Description</strong></p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>Aggretsuko is a story of Retsuko, a red panda who works in the Accounting Department of Carrier Man Trading Co., Ltd.
