In today’s article we’ve got a full review of <em>Paper Mario: The Origami King</em> for you to enjoy. There’s also a bit of news about the next <em>Tetris 99</em> event, summaries of all of the new releases including <em>Megadimension Neptunia VII</em>, and the usual lists of incoming and outgoing sales. Let’s do it!</p> \n<h3><strong>News</strong></h3> \n<p><strong>The Next ‘Tetris 99’ Event Features ‘Paper Mario: The Origami King’</strong></p> \n<p> </p>\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div> \n<div class=\"video-responsive\"> \n <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WyEgBsqUsq0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</div> \n<p></p> \n<p>Well, I think it’s safe to say there’s a pattern to the Maximus Cup events in <em>Tetris 99</em> at this point. If Nintendo’s got a big new first-party game to promote, chances are good that it will show up in<em> Tetris 99</em> at some point. So here we are with the latest event, which starts on Friday and runs through the weekend. It features <em>Paper Mario: The Origami King</em>, and as is generally the case with recent Maximus Cup events you can get your hands on a special theme by earning 100 points during the course of the event. Yes, bring me those themes. I will collect them <em>all</em>.</p> \n<h3><strong>Reviews</strong></h3> \n<h3><strong>Paper Mario: The Origami King ($59.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-269907\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/papermariotheorigamiking.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/papermariotheorigamiking.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/papermariotheorigamiking-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/papermariotheorigamiking-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/papermariotheorigamiking-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p>Hi, it’s me: the person that liked <em>Paper Mario: Sticker Star</em>. Yes, I played the earlier<em> Paper Mario</em> games. No, I didn’t play<em> Color Splash</em>. Why do I like <em>Sticker Star</em>? That’s a long story, but I kind of got what the developers were going for with it and enjoyed it for what it <em>was</em> rather than what I wanted it to be. I know that’s not something everyone can or wants to do, and that’s fine. I just want you all to know where I’m coming from.</p> \n<p><em>Paper Mario: The Origami King</em> is a fantastic game in <em>almost</em> every respect. From what has been revealed in interviews and the like, the developers have a lot more limitations in terms of what they can do in the <em>Mario</em> playground than they did back in the<em> Super Paper Mario</em> and <em>Thousand-Year Door</em> days. That doesn’t stop the game from having a fun story with memorable characters and villains, nor does it keep it from presenting some fresh areas and situations. It’s a <em>lot</em> better than <em>Sticker Star</em> in that regard. The graphics look great, using the clash between different materials to excellent effect. The music is absolutely outstanding. The team did a great job with it.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270215\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/papermariotok2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/papermariotok2.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/papermariotok2-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/papermariotok2-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/papermariotok2-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p>Like the last few games in the series, there’s a heavy focus on elements from adventure games. Lots of puzzles to solve, items to search for, and characters to talk to. For me, this is what the <em>Paper Mario</em> games are all about these days. It’s fairly challenging in places, but there are various ways for people who have issues to keep moving forward. I really loved traveling around the world and figuring out what I needed to do in each location. Not all of the puzzles land, but most of them do. And of course, it’s all wrapped up in an amazing localization that really brings the humor and clever wit that we’ve come to expect from <em>Paper Mario</em>.</p> \n<p>But there’s one big part of the game that I didn’t really enjoy that much. <em>Paper Mario</em> is a series that has gone through some major changes over its lifespan, with the first two games being firmly in the RPG realm, the third game being a <em>Monster World</em>-ish action-RPG, and the others not being quite sure of what they are at all. <em>Paper Mario</em> does not want to be an RPG anymore, but there are aspects of that genre that it just can’t seem to let go of. Sometimes those bits end up being pointless but harmless. The big nut that the developers can’t seem to crack is in the combat system.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270216\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/papermariotok3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/papermariotok3.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/papermariotok3-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/papermariotok3-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/papermariotok3-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p><em>Sticker Star</em>‘s combat system stayed quite similar to classic RPG battles, but without any sort of proper experience points on offer and limited battle resources, players rightfully questioned what the point of the battles were. From what I hear, <em>Color Splash</em> tried to add a few new twists to battles and also offered up pseudo-experience points in the form of Hammer Scraps that eventually increased your paint meter. For better or worse, <em>The Origami King</em>‘s battles feel further removed from standard RPG battles than ever before.</p> \n<p>There are still some RPG-ish bits, of course. You’ll select your command from a list of options, and numbers pop up showing how much damage you deal and receive. The timed button presses from previous <em>Mario</em> RPGs are still here, too. But battles in <em>The Origami King</em> are more like puzzles than anything else. You need to line up enemies by moving the rows and columns, something that gets quite tricky as you get deeper into the game. Successfully lining up enemies is a major benefit, so the pressure to solve the (timed) positioning puzzles is serious. Boss battles are even more puzzle-like, though the series was admittedly leaning heavily in that direction well before this title.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270217\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/papermariotok4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/papermariotok4.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/papermariotok4-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/papermariotok4-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/papermariotok4-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p>Your reward for winning a battle consists of coins and confetti. Coins are useful for buying items, of course. Confetti? Well, you’ll need a lot of it to fill in gaps you come across in your travels, but it’s not hard to come by at all. Nintendo doesn’t want you to get stuck, after all. Anywhere you need to use confetti, there will be something around you can smack with your hammer to refill your bag. Kind of a lousy reward, in other words, but I suppose it doesn’t matter since most battles aren’t all that easy to avoid anyway. You’re going to be fighting a lot whether you like it or not, and you’ll have to learn to deal with the cumbersome battle system as a result.</p> \n<p>In every respect but the battle system, <em>Paper Mario: The Origami King</em> is one of the best games in the series. Unfortunately, the battle system is a fairly large part of the game, and it’s just not great. I’ve dealt with worse, but I really wish the developers would just ditch the vestigial RPG stuff at this point. It’s not doing the games any favors, and I say that as a person who thinks water tastes better from a bottle with a <em>Dragon Quest</em> logo on it. Still, even taking all of the things I didn’t particularly enjoy in account,<em> Paper Mario: The Origami King</em> is a beautiful, hilarious adventure that is well-worth embarking upon.</p> \n<p><strong>SwitchArcade Score: 4/5</strong></p> \n<h3><strong>New Releases</strong></h3> \n<h3><strong>Megadimension Neptunia VII ($29.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270218\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/megadimensionneptuniavii.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/megadimensionneptuniavii.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/megadimensionneptuniavii-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/megadimensionneptuniavii-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/megadimensionneptuniavii-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p><strong>SwitchArcade Highlight!</strong></p> \n<p>Nep-Nep finally makes a proper debut on the Nintendo Switch with this conversion of the 2015 PlayStation 4 game. The mainline <em>Neptunia</em> series may be new to some players who have been locked into the Nintendo ecosystem since its debut, but it’s basically a mostly-lighthearted RPG series that loosely envisions consoles and game companies as cute and/or sexy anime ladies. The series is known for its inside jokes and charming characters, which do a lot to elevate what is otherwise a fairly ordinary RPG experience. No idea how well they pulled off the Switch port, but the original game wasn’t exactly taxing the PlayStation 4 so I’m guessing it will be fine.</p> \n<h3><strong>Ageless ($14.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270219\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ageless.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ageless.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ageless-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ageless-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ageless-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p>Publisher Team17 and developer One More Dream Studios offer up this rather interesting-looking puzzle platformer where your character can manipulate the age of her surroundings using a magical bow. So for example, a baby rhino is sitting on a platform that you would like to weigh down. You can use your bow to change it to an adult rhino, and boom, away you go. Visually, the game reminds me a lot of <em>Celeste</em>, so it kind of has that colorful, low-detail thing going on with its characters. Another similarity it has with <em>Celeste</em> is that it has a strong focus on story to go with its gameplay. This game looks really promising but I’ll have to spend more time with it before I can say anything definitive about it.</p> \n<h3><strong>Rugby Challenge 4 ($49.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270220\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/rugbychallenge4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/rugbychallenge4.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/rugbychallenge4-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/rugbychallenge4-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/rugbychallenge4-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p>The Rugby Challenge series arrives on Switch for the first time with Rugby Challenge 4. It features a number of improvements over the previous game in the series, but none of that is terribly relevant to Switch owners. I suppose one noteworthy thing here is that it’s describing itself as an Early Access release, with more features planned to be added after launch. I’m… not real keen on a nearly full-priced game launching in an admittedly far from finished state, but I guess they’re at least being honest about it. Anyway, there are lots of different moves, modes, and create options in this game, plus commentary from real personalities Grant Nisbett and Justin Marshall. Up to four players can enjoy this one at once, but there doesn’t seem to be any online play options as of yet.</p> \n<h3><strong>Escape Game Fort Boyard ($29.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270221\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/escapegamefortboyard.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/escapegamefortboyard.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/escapegamefortboyard-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/escapegamefortboyard-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/escapegamefortboyard-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p>There are lots of escape room games on the Switch, but this one is more of a party game than a puzzle or adventure game. Up to four players can join in on the fun via local multiplayer, in as much as there is fun to be had. Customize your characters and teams, then head into a bunch of mini-games with some light puzzle-solving and a lot of action-based stuff. The goal is to escape Fort Boyardee in time, lest you be buried under a torrential downpour of meaty Beefaroni. Oh wait, no. This is Fort <em>Boyard</em>. No Beefaroni as a penalty, only imprisonment. Well, that’s probably a worse punishment. Some people like Beefaroni enough that they might not mind sucking in their last breaths through a stream of the Chef’s tomato sauce. What were we talking about? Right, the expensive party game. I don’t know, I feel like there are better ways to enjoy video games with your friends or family, most of them much cheaper.</p> \n<h3><strong>Interrogation: You Will Be Deceived ($12.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270222\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/interrogationyouwillbedeceived.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/interrogationyouwillbedeceived.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/interrogationyouwillbedeceived-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/interrogationyouwillbedeceived-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/interrogationyouwillbedeceived-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p>You’re a police detective and your job is to take down a terrorist group in this narrative adventure game. The gameplay consists of interrogating suspects with a light layer of strategy in how you have to manage your team and your reputation. The subject matter is particularly topical at the moment, and the game is definitely interested in exploring a whole lot of philosophical issues around justice, morality, and the costs of safety. It raises some interesting questions, but the core narrative that it uses as a jumping off point doesn’t come together as well as you might hope. It’s also very puzzle-ish in its gameplay. There are right and wrong ways to maneuver through conversations, making for a frustratingly artificial trial-and-error feel to the proceedings. Not bad, but not as good as it could have been.</p> \n<h3><strong>Sales</strong></h3> \n<p><em><strong>(North American eShop, US Prices)</strong></em></p> \n<p>The outbox is big today, with some interesting titles on their way out that may not be on sale again for a while. Be sure to check through it and see if there’s anything there that you want, because I’ll be frank: the inbox probably isn’t going to do much for you.

The endless runner debuted on the App Store for iOS back in 2010 and it has been getting updates on and off ever since with a Ghostbusters update that we checked out a long time ago. In 2017, <em>Monster Dash</em> was pulled from the App Store because of GDPR compliance. If you’ve not played or heard of <em>Monster Dash</em>, the endless runner has you playing as Barry Steakfries as you blast through time taking on various monsters. Watch our TA Plays video on it <a href=\"https://toucharcade.com/2015/02/12/ta-plays-monster-dash-ghostbusters-update-2-99-well-spent/\">here</a>.

The soft launch will be available in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Philippines, and Indonesia. It is going to be interesting to see how this ends up being after so many years and so many endless runners on the platform. <em>Monster Dash</em> is free to play with in app purchases as expected.

The original launched way back in the summer of 2009, with a sequel following about 3 years later. Both titles offered sprawling adventures to enjoy and a unique twist on the tower defense genre, which was overly saturated in those years, and <em>Defender Chronicles</em> built up quite a following in the mobile gaming community. It was due to that pedigree that we were excited when one of the developers of that series, Menara Games, <a href=\"https://toucharcade.com/2016/04/26/demonrift-td-the-mountain-of-doom-is-coming-to-mobile-from-the-creators-of-defender-chronicles/\">announced</a> that they were working on a new tower defense RPG called <em>Demonrift TD: Mountain of Doom</em>, which would actually be an enhanced version of their <a href=\"https://www.kongregate.com/games/menaragames/demonrift-td\">popular Flash game</a> of the same name. Phew! You still following along? Anyway, we never heard anything more about <em>Demonrift TD</em> after that initial announcement in 2016. That is until this past weekend when Menara Games <a href=\"https://toucharcade.com/community/threads/beta-demonrift-td-a-free-core-rpg-towerdefense-mix-is-now-in-beta.410291/\">resurfaced on our forums</a> to say that the game was finally nearing the finish line. Here is a recent trailer.</p> \n<p> </p>\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div> \n<div class=\"video-responsive\"> \n <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WECCt-vVrP4\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</div> \n<p></p> \n<p>Menara’s Youtube channel has a few other pretty recent videos of <em>Demonrift TD</em> if you want to scope out some more, and they reveal in our forums that the game has actually been in development since 2013(!) and due to all sorts of circumstances they haven’t been able to finish it up until now. <strong>Seven</strong> years later. I love stories like this though, where a game that many had probably long figured was cancelled and never coming out actually lives to see the light of day. The game is also at the point where Menara is looking for some folks to take this nearly complete version for a spin to kick the tires and hopefully suss out any bugs or problems. If this sort of thing interests you, you can find a link to the Testflight version <a href=\"https://toucharcade.com/community/threads/beta-demonrift-td-a-free-core-rpg-towerdefense-mix-is-now-in-beta.410291/\">in the game’s forum thread</a>, as well as a link to the game’s Discord channel. While no release date has been settled on just yet, it appears as if <em>Demonrift TD</em> is very close to completion, so if you enjoy tower defense titles with RPG-style depth then keep your eyes peeled for this one soon or take the beta version for an early spin.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 28 Jul 2020 23:39:46 +0000","feedId":84,"bgimg":"https://toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2019-05-12-at-3.18.19-PM.png","linkMd5":"f879b1cf4d7005f10c851b09e09a7e3d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn40@2020_1/2020-07-29/1596002582269_aefa6f5a658fe37f.webp","metaImg":"https://toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2019-05-12-at-3.18.19-PM.png","author":"Jared Nelson"},{"createdTime":"2020-07-29 14:03:00","updatedTime":"2020-07-29 06:03:00","title":"An Exquisite LEGO Version of the Safe Puzzle Box from ‘The Room’ is Currently Up on LEGO Ideas","link":"https://toucharcade.com/?p=270205","description":"<p>For roughly half their existence, video games have largely been made up of pixel art. When the 3D polygonal era rose to prominence during the ’90s, pixel art still found its place in the world and continues to be a popular visual choice for games even today. There’s even a happy hybrid of the two called voxel art which is essentially 3D pixel art using cubes instead of flat 2D squares. Since by definition pixel art and especially voxel art are just virtual blocks put together to create objects and images, they compare very similarly to LEGO bricks in the real world, and thus it’s not too far fetched to see LEGO creations of iconic video game characters and settings. Heck, Nintendo has even partnered with LEGO for an <a href=\"https://www.lego.com/en-us/themes/super-mario\">official Super Mario line</a>, though I’m not really a big fan of their implementation (though I would 1000% buy the incredible <a href=\"https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/nintendo-entertainment-system-71374\">LEGO Nintendo Entertainment System</a> if it wasn’t so darn pricey).</p> \n<p>Anyhoo, after constantly being called “LEGO in video game form\" the developers of <em>Minecraft</em> decided that there should be an official <em>Minecraft</em> LEGO line, and by way of the LEGO Ideas website, they <a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/projects/11fb03f1-7fd6-47d5-bef7-a39763a523bf\">made that a reality</a>. That was nearly 10 years ago! Similarly, about 4 years ago a LEGO enthusiast by the name of Isometry realized that the gorgeous architectural levels of <em>Monument Valley</em> could also <a href=\"https://toucharcade.com/2016/02/16/monument-valley-lego/\">translate well to official LEGO sets</a>. Sadly that project didn’t get the green light from the LEGO powers that be, although it was a fantastic idea. Now we’ve got another popular video game that’s gunning for the LEGO treatment, and this time it’s the phenomenal room escape puzzle adventure <em>The Room</em> from Fireproof Games. Feast your eyes on this LEGO version of the gigantic safe that serves as the very first level of the original <em>The Room</em> game.</p> \n<p></p>\n<center>\n <img src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/resize-800-450.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270208\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/resize-800-450.jpeg 800w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/resize-800-450-300x169.jpeg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/resize-800-450-768x432.jpeg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\">\n <p></p> \n <p><img src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/resize-800-450-2.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270209\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/resize-800-450-2.jpeg 800w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/resize-800-450-2-300x169.jpeg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/resize-800-450-2-768x432.jpeg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n <p><img src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/resize-800-450-3.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270210\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/resize-800-450-3.jpeg 800w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/resize-800-450-3-300x169.jpeg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/resize-800-450-3-768x432.jpeg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p>\n</center>\n<p></p> \n<p>Oh man, this is <strong>so perfect</strong>, right down to the jewelry box and the letter from the mysterious A.S. on top. And the “eyepiece\" magnifying glass! I just love it. You can see even more pictures of this set <a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/projects/3c56e7c0-5c42-44bc-8939-555fc4450be4\">over at the LEGO Ideas page for it</a>, and that’s also where you can help bring this idea to life by showing your support by literally clicking the big blue SUPPORT button in the upper right corner. You’ll need a LEGO ID to register your support, but if this is the sort of thing you’re excitedly reading about chances are pretty good you already have one of those, and if not they’re easy and free to sign up for. This <em>The Room</em> set is the creation of Roger Schembri who is a graphic &amp; motion designer at Fireproof Games. Yes, someone who literally had a hand in making the game is behind this sweet LEGO set. </p> \n<p>The way the LEGO Ideas stuff works is that now that <em>The Room</em> project is officially live, there’s roughly 14 months to reach the 10,000 supporters goal which will trigger the project being sent to the actual LEGO employees who have the power to make the set a reality. At the 1,000 and 5,000 supporters marks you get an additional 6 month extension for each. Unfortunately for the <em>Monument Valley</em> idea it fell just short of the 6,000 mark, and so once time expired, that was that. I’m hoping that same fate won’t befall this clever <em>The Room</em> idea, and with more than 300 supporters in less than a week of being live it’s already off to a great start. So if you like LEGO and you like <em>The Room</em> it’s pretty much a no brainer to <a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/projects/3c56e7c0-5c42-44bc-8939-555fc4450be4\">go show your support at the LEGO Ideas website</a>.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 27 Jul 2020 21:57:56 +0000","feedId":84,"bgimg":"https://toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Safe_No_Logo_Hero_V2.jpg","linkMd5":"b55e732564fcf37acc9b665b89601c89","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn56@2020_4/2020-07-29/1596002582253_c424f4245c035a51.webp","metaImg":"https://toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Safe_No_Logo_Hero_V2.jpg","author":"Jared Nelson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/resize-800-450.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn65@2020_3/2020-07-29/1596002582054_10a56aa7a7af001d.webp","https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/resize-800-450-2.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn64@2020_6/2020-07-29/1596002582073_115add8639000736.webp","https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/resize-800-450-3.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn74@2020_1/2020-07-29/1596002582067_229470b2098dee13.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-07-29 14:02:58","updatedTime":"2020-07-29 06:02:58","title":"Best iPhone Game Updates: ‘Mario Kart Tour’, ‘Real Racing 3’, ‘Skulls of the Shogun’, ‘Mortal Kombat’, ‘Jurassic World Alive’, ‘Toy Blast’, and More","link":"https://toucharcade.com/?p=270180","description":"<p>Hello everyone, and welcome to the week!

A fine assortment of titles is featured in this week’s list, with a few lesser-seen faces in among the usual goons. Certainly enough to carry you through your breakfast, lunch, brunch, or elevensies. Of course, you can keep an eye out for updates yourself using AppShopper or by participating in the TouchArcade forums. This weekly summary is just here to fill you in on the things you might have missed.

You can also invite friends to your online races now, making it easier to play with the people you actually want to play with. Finally, the UI has seen some changes to try to make it easier to get at the things you’ll actually want to get at. </p> \n<p></p> \n<p> </p>\n<div style=\"float:left; padding-right:1em;\"> \n <center> \n  <a href=\"http://toucharcade.com/link/http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id981796690?mt=8\" alt=\"Dan The Man\" title=\"Dan The Man\" width=\"65\" height=\"65\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28686\"> <img style=\"border-radius:20px;\" src=\"https://toucharcade.com/wp-content/images/app/981796690/100x100bb.jpg\"> </a> \n </center> \n</div> \n<p> <a href=\"http://toucharcade.com/link/http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id981796690?mt=8\" style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> <b><i>Dan The Man</i></b>, Free </a> The update notes for <em>Dan the Man</em> are always so short. It makes it hard to write a paragraph about new versions, that’s for sure. This one seems to be summer-themed, with a new sand and surf beach background to battle in and a new ice cream costume. To beat the heat, you must <em>become</em> the treat. This update also makes some adjustments to certain levels in story mode to give them a little more polish. Finally, it makes with the squishy-wishy on the bugs. I’m honestly impressed this game is still getting updates after so many years, but I guess it’s still pretty popular. </p> \n<p></p> \n<p> </p>\n<div style=\"float:left; padding-right:1em;\"> \n <center> \n  <a href=\"http://toucharcade.com/link/http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id949701151?mt=8\" alt=\"Mortal Kombat\" title=\"Mortal Kombat\" width=\"65\" height=\"65\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28686\"> <img style=\"border-radius:20px;\" src=\"https://toucharcade.com/wp-content/images/app/949701151/100x100bb.jpg\"> </a> \n </center> \n</div> \n<p> <a href=\"http://toucharcade.com/link/http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id949701151?mt=8\" style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> <b><i>Mortal Kombat</i></b>, Free </a> Holy smokes, it’s been absolute ages since <em>Mortal Kombat</em> last updated. I was worried it was finished or something. But no, here it is, updating like nothing ever happened. The latest addition to the game is Klassic Smoke, a character that pays homage to Smoke’s first appearance way back in <em>Mortal Kombat II.</em> He’s a Gold character, and he should be available soon if not already. But wait, there’s more. New Shirai Ryu Towers! Three new Brutalities! New Tower equipment! Adjustments to some existing characters! And some serious Fatalities performed on some pesky bugs! Nice, nice. I think I’ll welcome it back with a coveted <em>UMMSotW</em> award. </p> \n<p></p> \n<p> </p>\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div> \n<div class=\"video-responsive\"> \n <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5wxoMy6J2W8\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</div> \n<p></p> \n<p> </p>\n<div style=\"float:left; padding-right:1em;\"> \n <center> \n  <a href=\"http://toucharcade.com/link/http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id1442583232?mt=8\" alt=\"Star Traders: Frontiers\" title=\"Star Traders: Frontiers\" width=\"65\" height=\"65\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28686\"> <img style=\"border-radius:20px;\" src=\"https://toucharcade.com/wp-content/images/app/1442583232/100x100bb.jpg\"> </a> \n </center> \n</div> \n<p> <a href=\"http://toucharcade.com/link/http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id1442583232?mt=8\" style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> <b><i>Star Traders: Frontiers</i></b>, $6.99 </a> Ah, <em>Star Traders: Frontiers</em>. You’ll never let me down when I’m looking for spiffy updates, will you? No, you won’t. So what’s new here? A new component, Armored Salvage Bay 5, which is Thulun-only and trades cargo and fuel for stronger armor. The regular Salvage Bay 5 also gets some minor improvements, getting a small bonus to ship ops and a bigger one to cargo. There are also some new ship filters including the Exact Crew Match, which only shows ships that the exact same max number of crew/officers as the current ship. You can also search by mass class. Those are handy if you’ve got a big fleet to deal with. As always with a Trese Brothers game update, there are a bunch of other little improvements and additions, so be sure to hit up those update notes if you want the full story. </p> \n<p></p> \n<p> </p>\n<div style=\"float:left; padding-right:1em;\"> \n <center> \n  <a href=\"http://toucharcade.com/link/http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id1435314243?mt=8\" alt=\"Langrisser\" title=\"Langrisser\" width=\"65\" height=\"65\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28686\"> <img style=\"border-radius:20px;\" src=\"https://toucharcade.com/wp-content/images/app/1435314243/100x100bb.jpg\"> </a> \n </center> \n</div> \n<p> <a href=\"http://toucharcade.com/link/http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id1435314243?mt=8\" style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> <b><i>Langrisser</i></b>, Free </a> <em>Langrisser</em> hasn’t exactly been playing in the <em>Fire Emblem Heroes</em> leagues like it seemed to be aiming for pre-launch, but it remains a fairly popular, well-liked spin on the free-to-play strategy game. In its latest update, you’re now able to preview skins in the Skin Store so that you have more information before plunking down cash. This comes on top of the big update earlier this month that added a bunch of new characters to the game. There were also some critical bug fixes based on player feedback. Yes, this entry <em>is</em> taking the place of a game that I had thought would be updated by today but didn’t make it in time.

Yes, it’s one of those <em>Blast</em> games. Blast it all. That means we’ve got 50 new levels to play, and some sort of fol-de-rol in the update notes about what those levels are meant to represent. Alright, let’s go look. Okay, whoever had “Indiana Jones-style raid into a volcanic mountain to steal the emerald eyes from an ancient statue in a secret temple\" gets the Kewpie doll. No one? <em>No one</em> guessed that for the story behind the new levels in<em> Toy Blast</em>? Well then, I’ll just keep the doll.

Ah, how much does <em>Jurassic Park/World</em> get away with just by having dinosaurs? So much. Dinosaur much. Anyway, you can now team up with your friends and alliance to battle some super-powerful <strong>DINOSAURS</strong> in these <strong>DINOSAUR RAIDS</strong>. Win Apex Raid battles, and again I stress these raids involve dinosaurs, and you’ll get Apex Boss Mortem Rex DNA. What will you do with it? Just dinosaur things. There are some other little tweaks and improvements in this update, but I cannot specifically claim that they are involved with the dinosaur-related content, so who cares? <strong>DINOSAUR CARES</strong>, that’s who. </p> \n<p></p> \n<p> </p>\n<div style=\"float:left; padding-right:1em;\"> \n <center> \n  <a href=\"http://toucharcade.com/link/http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id710354958?mt=8\" alt=\"Skulls of the Shogun\" title=\"Skulls of the Shogun\" width=\"65\" height=\"65\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28686\"> <img style=\"border-radius:20px;\" src=\"https://toucharcade.com/wp-content/images/app/710354958/100x100bb.jpg\"> </a> \n </center> \n</div> \n<p> <a href=\"http://toucharcade.com/link/http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id710354958?mt=8\" style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> <b><i>Skulls of the Shogun</i></b>, Free </a> You know the disclaimer by now: I write history articles for the people at GameClub, and they pay me for that work. That said, I only include their games here if it’s something I think is exciting, and for me, it doesn’t get much more exciting than <em>Skulls of the Shogun</em> being back from the dead. This is one of my favorite strategy games on mobile, and its life on iOS in its original incarnation was tragically short. GameClub has brought it back and it now runs on current devices. Note that if you’ve already bought this one and want to restore it without subscribing, you may have to drop the good folks at GameClub a note. Ah, I’m so glad this is back, though. Time to take General Akamoto to the top of the underworld yet again. </p> \n<p></p> \n<p> </p>\n<div style=\"float:left; padding-right:1em;\"> \n <center> \n  <a href=\"http://toucharcade.com/link/http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id556164008?mt=8\" alt=\"Real Racing 3\" title=\"Real Racing 3\" width=\"65\" height=\"65\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28686\"> <img style=\"border-radius:20px;\" src=\"https://toucharcade.com/wp-content/images/app/556164008/100x100bb.jpg\"> </a> \n </center> \n</div> \n<p> <a href=\"http://toucharcade.com/link/http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id556164008?mt=8\" style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> <b><i>Real Racing 3</i></b>, Free </a> Brabham joins the <em>Real Racing</em> roster in this roaring update to EA’s popular racer.

In today’s article, we’ve got a small slice of news, a full review of <em>Superliminal</em>, and a handful of Mini-Views including <em>Carrion</em>, <em>Rock of Ages 3</em>, and more. Oh, and we’ve got the usual lists of incoming and outgoing sales as you like them. We’ve got plenty to look at today, so let’s get down to business!</p> \n<h3><strong>News</strong></h3> \n<p><strong>Switch Online Subscribers Can Play ‘Pokken Tournament DX’ For a Week</strong></p> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270184\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/pokkentournamentswitchonline.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/pokkentournamentswitchonline.jpg 680w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/pokkentournamentswitchonline-300x169.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"></p> \n<p>It’s been a bit since Nintendo has done one of these outside of Japan, but the company is making <em>Pokken Tournament DX</em> available to play free for one week for Nintendo Switch Online subscribers. From July 29th to August 4th, you can play to your heart’s content. If you like what you play, the game will be available to buy at a discount when the trial period ends. Your save data will carry over, of course. If you happen to have a Japanese Nintendo Account, you can hop onto the Japanese eShop and get the party started today.</p> \n<h3><strong>Reviews</strong></h3> \n<h3><strong>Superliminal ($20.00)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-269540\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/superliminal.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/superliminal.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/superliminal-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/superliminal-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/superliminal-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p><em>Superliminal</em> has a very strong gimmick to its gameplay that gives it a lot of up-front impact. It explores that gimmick in a variety of ways, and then it ends before it overstays its welcome. The idea here is that you’re exploring your own dreams, and nothing is really what it seems to be. Almost all of the puzzles in this first-person adventure can be solved by manipulating perspective, whether that be getting yourself at just the right angle to make a painted surface into an object, or positioning blocks near or far away from you to change their sizes. It’s interesting, more than a little trippy, and just loose enough with its rules to let you feel like you’re finding novel solutions.</p> \n<p>The game only lasts for a few hours, and there isn’t a lot of replay value to it beyond going through the story again. Once you’ve figured out the tricks to each puzzle, you won’t get much out of doing them a second or third time. From a narrative point of view, there are a lot of compelling bits that sadly culminate in a bit of a nothing ending. A simple platitude is offered and you’re sent on your way. It would be less disappointing if it hadn’t been so intriguing in its vague hints that are woven through most of the game. There are also a couple of “puzzles\" that just don’t communicate themselves well at all.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270185\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/superliminal2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/superliminal2.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/superliminal2-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/superliminal2-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/superliminal2-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p>That all said, most of the time <em>Superliminal</em> is engaging and enjoyable. If you like oddball puzzle games like Portal and its ilk, or just want to slide into a different kind of experience, <em>Superliminal</em> will hold your attention from start to finish. It would be nice if it were a little longer, but I appreciate games that don’t stretch themselves too thin and that could very well have happened here. So instead, I’ll just moan a little about the lackluster ending and give the game a strong recommendation anyway. Oh, and if you find yourself dealing with a persistent pit, take a careful leap of faith and watch your feet.</p> \n<p><strong>SwitchArcade Score: 4/5</strong></p> \n<h3><strong>Mini-Views</strong></h3> \n<h3><strong>Carrion ($19.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270090\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/carrion.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/carrion.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/carrion-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/carrion-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/carrion-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p>Reverse-horror, eh? Imagine one of those stories about some weird creature being contained at an isolated facility that breaks out and goes on a killing spree. Now imagine you’re the creature, and that’s Carrion. It’s a Metroidvania where you’re playing something that reminds me a lot of one of those alien symbiotes from <em>Spider-Man</em>, and that automatically earned it bonus points with me. You can climb all over the place, grab things with your tendrils and whip them around, and chow down on humans at a brisk clip. I don’t have a ton of complaints but the lack of a proper map sure made things a lot harder than they needed to be. Things get more unwieldy as you grow larger and gain new abilities, leading to some minor backtracking and control quirks. There’s another bit I didn’t enjoy much but don’t feel like spoiling. Otherwise, it’s a lot of fun, extremely stylish, a bit violent, and well-paced; just the kind of game we’ve come to expect Devolver Digital to publish. Developer Phobia Game Studio did a nice job here with a rather wild concept.</p> \n<p><strong>SwitchArcade Score: 4/5</strong></p> \n<h3><strong>Radical Rabbit Stew ($15.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-269861\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/radicalrabbitstew.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/radicalrabbitstew.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/radicalrabbitstew-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/radicalrabbitstew-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/radicalrabbitstew-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p>I’m a sucker for these top-down puzzle-action games in the vein of <em>Bomberman</em>, and <em>Radical Rabbit Stew</em> doesn’t disappoint. Your goal on each stage is simple enough. There are pots of stew placed around the stage, and you’ll need to whack a rabbit into each of them using your trusty spoon. The rabbits can and will bite back, so you need to be careful how you approach them. You’ll gain new abilities and items, and the stages start seeding in more gimmicks and obstacles to deal with. There are also boss battles that are quite well-done. You also get a multiplayer mode, but it doesn’t come together as well as I expected it to. Still, the game earns its keep on its relatively meaty and fun single-player campaign. Oh, and the presentation is fantastic. Love those sprites, and the music is catchy as heck. Just a really well-made “gamey\" game that scratched my puzzle-action game itch in all the right places.</p> \n<p><strong>SwitchArcade Score: 4/5</strong></p> \n<h3><strong>Rock of Ages 3: Make &amp; Break ($29.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270032\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/rockofages3makeandbreak.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/rockofages3makeandbreak.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/rockofages3makeandbreak-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/rockofages3makeandbreak-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/rockofages3makeandbreak-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p>If you loved the first two games in this series, you’re going to really like<em> Rock of Ages 3</em>. You get another hilarious story to play through, some new gimmicks to deal with, and the rather impressive “Make\" mode that allows you to build your own custom stages. You can play with up to four players in the online multiplayer mode, and if you can get a good group going you’ll have hours of fun ahead of you. On the other hand, the core gameplay hasn’t seen that many changes and is no longer as novel as it once was. I had a lot of laughs with this one, but I found myself getting tired of the core mechanic well before I pushed through all of the content. It also felt like the loading was a bit on the excessive side, but that’s perhaps just part of the Switch experience these days. Setting aside my complaints that are largely born from playing a bit too much of the first two games, this is another solid game in a quality series. And if you’re new to the series, this is definitely the one to get.</p> \n<p><strong>SwitchArcade Score: 3.5/5</strong></p> \n<h3><strong>New Releases</strong></h3> \n<h3><strong>Cubicity ($6.00)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270186\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/cubicity.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/cubicity.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/cubicity-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/cubicity-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/cubicity-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p>This is a puzzle game whose core mechanic is a very familiar one. You’ve got different animals that you need to move around each stage to reach designated goal squares. Animals will move in the direction you push until they hit a wall or other obstacle, so you have to think carefully about where you’re directing them. There are some gimmicks to put a twist on the idea as you go along, but nothing that really makes a huge difference. You get almost a hundred stages, and there are lots of unlockable characters. If you like these kinds of sliding puzzles, <em>Cubicity</em> isn’t too bad. But that’s about all I can say for it.</p> \n<h3><strong>Sales</strong></h3> \n<p><em><strong>(North American eShop, US Prices)</strong></em></p> \n<p>Some interesting sales came in over the weekend. A few good games hit some very cheap prices, including <em>The Warlock of Firetop Mountain, Swords &amp; Soldiers</em>, and<em> Swap This!</em>. <em>Power Rangers: Battle for the Grid</em> celebrates its latest update with a sale on both the base game and the first two seasons of DLC. There are some other decent titles in there, so have a careful look. As for the outbox, the latest sale on the <em>Naruto</em> games is coming to a close. Beyond that, it’s a lot of the usual suspects, so feel free to focus your attention on some of those games that went on sale late last week instead.</p> \n<p><strong>Select New Games on Sale</strong></p> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-258388\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/warlockoffiretop.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/warlockoffiretop.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/warlockoffiretop-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/warlockoffiretop-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/warlockoffiretop-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p><em><strong>The Warlock of Firetop Mountain</strong></em> ($2.99 from $29.99 until 8/14)<br> <em><strong>Swords &amp;

And believe me, there are A LOT of cat-based video games out there. Enough so that I used to have my own segment on our podcast called Jared’s Kitty Korner where I’d exclusively talk about that week’s best cat-based game. We started that segment on the <a href=\"https://toucharcade.com/2011/07/29/the-toucharcade-show-010-introducing-jareds-kitty-korner/\">10th episode</a> of the podcast, and our latest episode is number 454, so yeah it was a long time ago. Almost 9 years ago to the day, in fact. Anyway, the point is that I like cat games, and I especially like cat games that are totally off the walls bananas. Not since <a href=\"https://toucharcade.com/2011/05/24/upcoming-techno-kitten-adventure/\"><em>Techno Kitten Adventure</em></a> have I seen a game that is as off the walls bananas as developer Teamcoil’s <em>PUSS!</em> I guess I would call it a maze game set in a bad acid trip where the mazes feature deadly traps. Also it’s a roguelike. After earning a bit of a cult following on Steam, <em>PUSS!</em> is now heading to mobile devices on August 6th, and this… this is the game in action.</p> \n<p> </p>\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div> \n<div class=\"video-responsive\"> \n <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3Vc5oG1vlLc\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</div> \n<p></p> \n<p>I don’t even really know what to say! It’s glorious. <em>PUSS!</em> originally <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/719750/PUSS/\">launched on Steam</a> in August of 2018, and it was during its first birthday about a year ago that they announced that a mobile version was planned. Here in the days prior to its second birthday the mobile <em>PUSS!</em> is ready to be unleashed on the world. The mobile version’s UI has been revamped to make it nice on the touchscreen and for being on a smaller screen in general, and the game will come with 150 levels to play through as well as 95 unlockable player avatars, achievements, and online leaderboards. Surprisingly, <em>PUSS!</em> will be a premium release and will set you back just $2.99. You can pre-order it right now on <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1476927962\">the iOS App Store here</a> or if you’re on Android on <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.TeamCoil.PUSS\">the Google Play Store here</a>, and look for <em>PUSS!</em> to launch in both app stores next week on August 6th.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 28 Jul 2020 20:59:10 +0000","feedId":84,"bgimg":"https://toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/PUSS_Promo_2.jpg","linkMd5":"1507d9293339755f6aa7c5b09439e9d9","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn60@2020_1/2020-07-29/1596002582356_cf3214221d2f46d0.webp","metaImg":"https://toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/PUSS_Promo_2.jpg","author":"Jared Nelson"},{"createdTime":"2020-07-29 14:03:00","updatedTime":"2020-07-29 06:03:00","title":"Monster Raising Game ‘Monster Rancher 2’ from Koei Tecmo Releases This September in Japan with Pre-Orders Now Live on the App Store","link":"https://toucharcade.com/?p=270189","description":"<p> <a href=\"https://toucharcade.com/2020/07/07/monster-rancher-2-ios-android-port-japan-nintendo-switch-release/\">Earlier this month</a>, Koei Tecmo announced that <em>Monster Rancher 2</em> will be coming to iOS, Android, and Nintendo Switch this Fall. <em>Monster Rancher 2</em> on mobile will include improvements and new content and it follows the original release that arrived on mobile and Nintendo Switch. <a href=\"https://toucharcade.com/2019/09/12/monster-rancher-ios-android-port-release-date-koei-tecmo-japan/\">Koei Tecmo brought</a> the original PlayStation <em>Monster Rancher</em> to iOS, Android, and Nintendo Switch in Japan but a localisation has still not been announced.
