He starts off by going over the specs, saying:</p> \n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">‘<em>The Z9 is built around a newly developed FX-format stacked CMOS 80.2MP sensor with a 20-stop dynamic range (19.77 EV) with a native 50–102,400 ISO range (expandable to 25–204,800). The Z9 has an updated hybrid AF system comprising 1,080 on-sensor phase-detection AF points as well as 850 contrast-detect points, covering 98% of the image frame.’</em></p> \n<p>Moving to the outside of the camera, van Oosten says the body ' is considerably smaller than a D6 and a whole lot lighter despite having an integrated vertical grip.' Better yet, he claims that the entire camera is apparently made from titanium, a first in the photography world, if true. Which, again, it almost certainly isn't.</p> \n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"images noCrop singleNoBorder center\" data-image-height=\"null\" data-image-width=\"590\"> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td class=\"image\" style=\"width: 590px;\"><a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/files/p/articles/1248945703/162D5670-F6C0-4084-8E91-482D412FAB1A.jpeg\" target=\"article-bf6f353a72ec439484fc1a56805fc4ee\"><img border=\"0\" data-thumbnail-height=\"0\" data-thumbnail-width=\"590\" height=\"586\" src=\"https://2.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS590x0~articles/1248945703/162D5670-F6C0-4084-8E91-482D412FAB1A.jpeg\" width=\"590\" data-filename=\"162D5670-F6C0-4084-8E91-482D412FAB1A.jpeg\" /></a></td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td class=\"caption\" style=\"width: 590px;\">These features may or may not appear in the final version of the Z9.</td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xUdYIcUVNM\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">But wait, there’s <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">less</span> more!</a> The first surprise feature, according to the field report, is a new switch on the bottom of the grip that displays a fire icon. Van Oosten says this little guy will turn on a heating element inside the grip and shutter button that will keep your ‘hands and fingers toasty warm on those cold winter shoots.’</p> \n<p>The next trick up the Z9’s sleeve, apparently, is a little button near the microphone of the camera that will initiate Niko, a new smart assistant that will ‘help you find the right exposure, find the nearest Starbucks, or give feedback on your images.’ According to van Oosten, there are three different feedback levels Niko can provide:</p> \n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">'<em>Beginner (“Great shot, well done!”), Constructive Critique (“Have you tried a vertical composition?”), and Passive Aggressive (“I don’t care about this image, but someone else might”).</em></p> \n<p>There does appear to be a bug, however, as van Oosten explains:</p> \n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">'<em>When this function is enabled, it shows up on the LCD screen as “Virtual Ass” because it’s too long. This will be fixed with a future firmware update.'’</em></p> \n<p>Other features that van Oosten claims are present in the Z9 include built-in 5G connectivity that allows you to identify any animal species in frame, as well as Nikompanion, a new in-camera dating app for photographers, and MosQUITo, a new feature that uses ultrasonic sounds to keep mosquitos up to 3m (9ft) away while in the field.</p> \n<p>Head over to Squiver for van Oosten’s full field report, linked below.</p> \n<p class=\"actionButton\"><a href=\"https://www.squiver.com/blog/nikon-z9-field-report/\">Squiver Nikon Z9 Field Report</a></p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 01 Apr 2021 18:59:00 +0000","feedId":70,"bgimg":"https://3.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TC4x3S590x0~articles/1248945703/7C74E524-879C-4DF2-AE90-7B1BE5CDF0F7.png","linkMd5":"d21cbfac1b0a5327e294ab1d2b3a3630","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn17@2020_1/2021/04/03/04-49-49-560_ab734f75c9012422.webp","destWidth":590,"destHeight":443,"sourceBytes":406606,"destBytes":20634,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://3.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TC4x3S590x0~articles/1248945703/7C74E524-879C-4DF2-AE90-7B1BE5CDF0F7.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn17@2020_1/2021/04/03/04-49-49-560_ab734f75c9012422.webp","https://2.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS590x0~articles/1248945703/162D5670-F6C0-4084-8E91-482D412FAB1A.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn13@2020_2/2021/04/03/04-50-23-449_812673d91b4626d4.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617425389028},{"createdTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:49","updatedTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:49","title":"Snap It is a subscription service for disposable cameras","link":"https://www.dpreview.com/news/3103899314/snap-it-is-a-subscription-service-for-disposable-cameras","description":"<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"images noCaptions noCrop singleNoBorder center\" data-image-height=\"null\" data-image-width=\"590\"> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td class=\"image\" style=\"width: 590px;\"><a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/files/p/articles/3103899314/snap-it-disposable-camera-3.jpeg\" target=\"article-bcace9537c5a43628d93e251ccc47e4c\"><img border=\"0\" data-thumbnail-height=\"0\" data-thumbnail-width=\"590\" height=\"454\" src=\"https://2.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS590x0~articles/3103899314/snap-it-disposable-camera-3.jpeg\" width=\"590\" data-filename=\"snap-it-disposable-camera-3.jpeg\" /></a></td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table> \n<p>In many industries, what's popular comes and goes in cycles. Fashion is a prime example of this phenomenon. The 1990s are back in vogue, and photography isn't immune to this cyclical behavior. Disposable cameras are suddenly popular again, as evidenced by <a href=\"https://snapitbox.com\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Snap It</a> finding its footing online.</p> \n<p>When digital photography took over the industry and film cameras became less prevalent, photo developing services started disappearing. In some areas, it's impossible to get the film developed. Snap It has launched a new subscription service that includes a disposable camera and allows customers to send the camera for development to solve this issue. Like another recent addition to the resurging film photography market, <a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/news/7934743919/developed-film-to-your-phone-service-from-indisposable\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Indisposable</a>, Snap It then sends digital versions of your photos straight to your phone.

The marketing strategy seems to channel the nostalgia people feel for disposable cameras and the current 'cool' factor of the 90s into disposable camera subscriptions.</p> \n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"images noCaptions noCrop singleNoBorder center\" data-image-height=\"null\" data-image-width=\"590\"> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td class=\"image\" style=\"width: 590px;\"><a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/files/p/articles/3103899314/snap-it-disapble-camera-90s.jpeg\" target=\"article-bcace9537c5a43628d93e251ccc47e4c\"><img border=\"0\" data-thumbnail-height=\"0\" data-thumbnail-width=\"590\" height=\"454\" src=\"https://3.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS590x0~articles/3103899314/snap-it-disapble-camera-90s.jpeg\" width=\"590\" data-filename=\"snap-it-disapble-camera-90s.jpeg\" /></a></td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table> \n<p>While you can purchase disposable cameras for less and develop the film yourself, the convenience Snap It offers has value. Of course, arguably, the lack of instant gratification and inconvenience of film photography is seemingly also part of its charm.

We've known about its eventual existence in some form or other since development announcements in 2019, but we were still a bit taken aback by just how much reworking Ricoh has done on this camera; it shares a lot of its design and handling DNA with the previous model, but on the inside, just about <em>everything</em> is brand new.</p> \n<p>So without further ado, let's take a little tour of Ricoh's latest flagship APS-C DSLR.</p> \n<h2>Grip and overall design</h2> \n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"images noCaptions noCrop single center\" data-image-height=\"\" data-image-width=\"520\"> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td class=\"image\" style=\"width: 520px;\"><img border=\"0\" data-thumbnail-height=\"0\" data-thumbnail-width=\"520\" height=\"347\" src=\"https://1.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS520x0~articles/2267869033/DSC09098.acr_1.jpeg\" width=\"520\" data-filename=\"DSC09098.acr_1.jpeg\" /></td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table> \n<p>First things first, this is unmistakably a Pentax DSLR, from the angular lines surrounding the pentaprism viewfinder to the deep, comfortable grip. The magnesium-alloy body feels incredibly solid and secure, and the K-3 III comes with the same claims of extensive sealing that we have come to expect from Pentax cameras.</p> \n<p>To be certain, if you're looking for a petite camera, the K-3 III (and, well, most DSLRs at this point) shouldn't be on your shopping list. But if you like the size and extensive external controls that come with a high-end DSLR, the K-3 III won't leave you wanting.</p> \n<h2>New sensor</h2> \n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"images noCaptions noCrop single center\" data-image-height=\"null\" data-image-width=\"520\"> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td class=\"image\" style=\"width: 520px;\"><img border=\"0\" data-thumbnail-height=\"0\" data-thumbnail-width=\"520\" height=\"347\" src=\"https://1.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS520x0~articles/2267869033/DSC09102.acr.jpeg\" width=\"520\" data-filename=\"DSC09102.acr.jpeg\" /></td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table> \n<p>At the heart of the K-3 Mark III is a new 26MP APS-C sensor, likely related to the sensor seen in recent Fujifilm cameras (but with a traditional Bayer color filter array instead of Fujifilm's trademark X-Trans design). That sensor should provide outstanding image quality and fast readout, but it doesn't come with any form of on-sensor phase-detection autofocus.</p> \n<p>While this won't impact viewfinder shooting, photographers using live view and framing up their images (or video clips) on the rear screen will have to make do with the hunting associated with contrast-detect autofocus.</p> \n<h2>Stabilizer, autofocus and metering sensor</h2> \n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"images noCaptions noCrop single center\" data-image-height=\"null\" data-image-width=\"520\"> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td class=\"image\" style=\"width: 520px;\"><img border=\"0\" data-thumbnail-height=\"0\" data-thumbnail-width=\"520\" height=\"347\" src=\"https://1.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS520x0~articles/2267869033/DSC09102.acr_1_1.jpeg\" width=\"520\" data-filename=\"DSC09102.acr_1_1.jpeg\" /></td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table> \n<p>The sensor sits inside a redesigned Shake Reduction mechanism, giving users around 5.5 stops of compensation, which is the most we've yet seen from a DSLR. An all-new SAFOX 13 autofocus module is fed light when the mirror (not seen here) is flipped down, and that module comes with 101 autofocus points (25 cross-type).</p> \n<p>It works in tandem with a new high-res metering sensor, and Ricoh says that machine-learning algorithms and new movement prediction algorithms have been utilized to improve tracking performance (we'll test this when we have a fully reviewable camera on hand).</p> \n<h2>Top plate controls</h2> \n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"images noCaptions noCrop single center\" data-image-height=\"\" data-image-width=\"520\"> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td class=\"image\" style=\"width: 520px;\"><img border=\"0\" data-thumbnail-height=\"0\" data-thumbnail-width=\"520\" height=\"347\" src=\"https://1.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS520x0~articles/2267869033/DSC09115.acr_1.jpeg\" width=\"520\" data-filename=\"DSC09115.acr_1.jpeg\" /></td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table> \n<p>Around the top of the camera, you get a rather smaller LCD display for your settings than the previous K-3 model, but it packs in a similar amount of information. As a trade-off, you gain a second customizable control dial for your thumb, seen here at far-bottom-right. This can be assigned to one of 22 possible options, and a button toggles between up to five of those for you.</p> \n<p>Just above the screen is a dial dedicated to switching between stills, live view (shooting on the rear display) and movie shooting. There's the familiar power-switch + shutter button combination that falls comfortably under your right index finger (and the shutter button mechanism has been redesigned for more durability as well as a more subtle response).</p> \n<p>Along the left shoulder of the camera is the main mode dial as well as an option to lock or unlock its operation. If it's locked, you must press the middle button in the mode dial to turn it, while you don't need to do so if it's unlocked. Also, did you notice there are no fewer than <em>five</em> custom settings banks?</p> \n<h2>Rear controls</h2> \n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"images noCaptions noCrop single center\" data-image-height=\"\" data-image-width=\"520\"> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td class=\"image\" style=\"width: 520px;\"><img border=\"0\" data-thumbnail-height=\"0\" data-thumbnail-width=\"520\" height=\"347\" src=\"https://1.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS520x0~articles/2267869033/DSC09120.acr_1.jpeg\" width=\"520\" data-filename=\"DSC09120.acr_1.jpeg\" /></td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table> \n<p>The rear of the Pentax K-3 Mark III is dominated by a fixed 3.2\" touch-sensitive display with a solid resolution of 1.6M dots. There's also an eye-sensor under the optical viewfinder, so the screen disables itself automatically when you raise the camera to your eye: especially handy for shooting in low-light conditions.</p> \n<p>The touchscreen by default doesn't allow you to manipulate settings on this main screen, but you can use it to navigate menus as well as zoom into or swipe between images in playback. In live view shooting, you can use it to place your autofocus area, initiate autofocus acquisition, and if you so choose, fire off a shot.</p> \n<p>There's now an 8-way autofocus joystick which lets you place the AF point around the viewfinder frame, and of course the Pentax 'green button' has a prominent spot. This button can, among other things, help users reset their exposure parameters when in various shooting modes.</p> \n<h2>Optical viewfinder</h2> \n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"images noCaptions noCrop single center\" data-image-height=\"null\" data-image-width=\"520\"> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td class=\"image\" style=\"width: 520px;\"><img border=\"0\" data-thumbnail-height=\"0\" data-thumbnail-width=\"520\" height=\"347\" src=\"https://3.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS520x0~articles/2267869033/DSC09122.acr_1.jpeg\" width=\"520\" data-filename=\"DSC09122.acr_1.jpeg\" /></td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table> \n<p>The K-3 III's optical viewfinder has been entirely redesigned. It now has a transparent display panel in the viewing path, rather than the display of a separate panel projected into the finder, and the result is a claimed 10% increase in overall brightness compared with the previous model.</p> \n<p>The finder offers an impressive 1.05x magnification (equivalent to to 0.68x magnification on a full-frame camera). This is the best we've seen on an APS-C DSLR, though there are a few mirrorless APS-C models that have larger equivalent magnifications for their <em>electronic</em> viewfinders. Still, if you prefer an optical viewfinder, this one is perhaps the best you'll find on a crop-sensor camera.</p> \n<h2>Main ports and side controls</h2> \n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"images noCaptions noCrop single center\" data-image-height=\"null\" data-image-width=\"520\"> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td class=\"image\" style=\"width: 520px;\"><img border=\"0\" data-thumbnail-height=\"0\" data-thumbnail-width=\"520\" height=\"347\" src=\"https://4.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS520x0~articles/2267869033/DSC09127.acr.jpeg\" width=\"520\" data-filename=\"DSC09127.acr.jpeg\" /></td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table> \n<p>As we mentioned in a previous slide, the K-3 III is brimming with external controls; along the left side of the camera, you'll find dedicated autofocus controls and further dedicated controls for image quality and Shake Reduction settings (and these buttons are customizable).</p> \n<p>In terms of ports, the K-3 III comes with both microphone and headphone ports to support its up-to-4K/30p video capture, as well as micro HDMI and USB-C. It's USB-C port can charge the camera, and no external charger is included in the box.</p> \n<h2>Storage</h2> \n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"images noCaptions noCrop single center\" data-image-height=\"null\" data-image-width=\"520\"> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td class=\"image\" style=\"width: 520px;\"><img border=\"0\" data-thumbnail-height=\"0\" data-thumbnail-width=\"520\" height=\"347\" src=\"https://2.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS520x0~articles/2267869033/DSC09129.acr.jpeg\" width=\"520\" data-filename=\"DSC09129.acr.jpeg\" /></td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table> \n<p>Along the right side of the camera are a pair of SD memory card slots, one of which is UHS-II compatible (we'd have loved to see them both carry this designation though, given the fast 12fps maximum burst speeds the K-3 III is capable of). Underneath those, protected by a rubber plug, sits a remote socket.</p> \n<h2>Battery</h2> \n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"images noCaptions noCrop single center\" data-image-height=\"null\" data-image-width=\"520\"> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td class=\"image\" style=\"width: 520px;\"><img border=\"0\" data-thumbnail-height=\"0\" data-thumbnail-width=\"520\" height=\"347\" src=\"https://4.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS520x0~articles/2267869033/DSC09136.acr.jpeg\" width=\"520\" data-filename=\"DSC09136.acr.jpeg\" /></td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table> \n<p>In terms of power, the K-3 Mark III uses the same D-LI90P battery as the K-1 Mark II; here it provides a CIPA rating of 800 shots per charge, though it won't be uncommon to get double that number. Outright battery stamina is one area where the DSLR still truly reigns supreme.</p> \n<h2>And battery grip</h2> \n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"images noCaptions noCrop single center\" data-image-height=\"null\" data-image-width=\"520\"> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td class=\"image\" style=\"width: 520px;\"><img border=\"0\" data-thumbnail-height=\"0\" data-thumbnail-width=\"520\" height=\"347\" src=\"https://4.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS520x0~articles/2267869033/DSC09145.acr.jpeg\" width=\"520\" data-filename=\"DSC09145.acr.jpeg\" /></td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table> \n<p>...But if 800 rated shots per charge isn't enough for you, well there's an accessory battery grip available for the K-3 Mark III to boost that by a significant number. It comes with the expected duplicate controls (including an 8-way joystick and the newly designed shutter) on the rear for more comfort when shooting in portrait orientation, as shown here.</p> \n<h2>Hands-on with Ricoh's Pentax K-3 Mark III</h2> \n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"images noCaptions noCrop single center\" data-image-height=\"\" data-image-width=\"520\"> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td class=\"image\" style=\"width: 520px;\"><img border=\"0\" data-thumbnail-height=\"0\" data-thumbnail-width=\"520\" height=\"347\" src=\"https://2.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS520x0~articles/2267869033/DSC09154.acr_1.jpeg\" width=\"520\" data-filename=\"DSC09154.acr_1.jpeg\" /></td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table> \n<p>And that about does it for our tour of Ricoh's Pentax K-3 Mark III. Thanks to rapid product cycles and a collectively short-ish memory of much of the consumer public (or perhaps just human beings in general), it may seem almost anachronistic to release an all-new flagship DSLR in the spring of 2021. However, our initial impressions are positive.</p> \n<p>It's clear that the Pentax K-3 Mark III is a high-end DSLR for high-end DSLR users. Those that like a pronounced grip, a plethora of external controls, and the feel of an optical viewfinder will find a compelling combination here. We've yet to be able to do much shooting with the camera, but expect our in-depth evaluations of image quality, autofocus and video performance to come as soon as possible, once we've received a reviewable sample.</p> \n<p>What do you make of the Pentax K-3 Mark III?

Still, while those differences may seem small for stills or even hybrid shooters, for those who need the more cinema-specific features, the FX3 still fills a niche.</p> \n<p>Other features included in firmware version 2.00 includes ‘support for setting Steady Shot to Active during recording movie with S&amp;Q Frame Rate’ and overall improved stability.

The pentaprism finder has a transparent display built into the optical path, which allows more information to be shown in the finder and allows a design which is 10% brighter than the existing model. The K-3 III also gains touchscreen control of various functions.</p> \n<p>As you'd expect on a Pentax DSLR, the K-3 III features modes such as Pixel Shift Resolution and Anti-Aliasing Filter Simulation, to maximize image detail and avoid moiré, respectively.

Designed around the PENTAX Principles, the new camera offers advanced functions and outstanding imaging performance with a goal of optimizing the fun and excitement of photography in a wide variety of conditions.</p> \n  <p class=\"p7\">The PENTAX K-3 Mark III builds on the PENTAX legacy of outstanding image quality, incorporating a back-illuminated CMOS image sensor with approximately 25.73 effective megapixels. By coupling this sensor with an AA (anti-aliasing)-filter-free optical design, the camera produces super-high-resolution images. A newly developed, high-performance PRIME V imaging engine and new-generation accelerator unit delivers well-defined images with minimal noise, while retaining high-resolution reproduction at all sensitivities. The PENTAX K-3 Mark III boasts a super-high sensitivity of ISO 1600000 and features a newly developed SAFOX 13 autofocus system with 101 focus sensors.</p> \n  <p class=\"p7\">A new, super-bright optical viewfinder delivers a nearly 100% field of view and magnification of approximately 1.05 times. With a newly developed high-refraction glass prism, the viewfinder provides a wide field of view equivalent to that of a full-frame SLR, fully immersing the photographer in shooting.</p> \n  <p class=\"p7\">The camera’s compact, rugged body is dustproof and weather resistant, making it suitable for use in the most extreme environmental conditions. It features PENTAX’s high-performance, five-axis shake-reduction (SR) system, minimizing camera shake to deliver sharp, blur-free images. Furthering its commitment to producing the highest quality images, the PENTAX K-3 Mark III features the innovative Pixel Shift Resolution System, employing advanced super-resolution technology to capture four images of the same scene by shifting the image sensor by a single pixel for each image, then synthesize them into a single composite image.</p> \n  <p class=\"p7\">The PENTAX K-3 Mark III is equipped with user-friendly shooting functions, improved efficiency and operability. These include a high-definition 3.2-inch touch-screen LCD monitor—the first touch screen in the PENTAX K series. The screen allows intuitive operation of a variety of functions, including scrolling menu selection and image zooming during playback.</p> \n  <p class=\"p7\">The camera also features PENTAX Real-time Scene Analysis System, supported by the latest artificial intelligence technology. It can instantly detect a subject’s face and eyes using advanced image recognition technology and makes a real-time analysis of the subject’s movement. The system assists the camera in optimizing exposure settings and improving autofocusing accuracy, assuring more accurate subject detection and more reliable scene judgment.</p> \n  <p class=\"p7\">“The development of the PENTAX K-3 Mark III has been a longtime labor of love,” said Kaz Eguchi, president, Ricoh Imaging Americas Corporation. “At Ricoh, our goal is to develop high-quality cameras with the power to capture images that speak louder than words and inspire photographers to continue pursuing their passion for photography every day.”</p> \n  <h3 class=\"p7\">| Pricing and Availability|</h3> \n  <p class=\"p7\">The PENTAX K-3 Mark III will be available in late April at www.us.ricoh-imaging.com and can be pre-ordered at Ricoh Imaging-authorized retail outlets starting on April 6 at 5 p.m. ET for the manufacturer’s suggested retail price of $1,999.95.</p> \n  <p class=\"p7\">Ricoh is also producing two limited-edition kits -- the PENTAX K-3 Mark III Black Premium Kit and PENTAX K-3 Mark III Silver Premium Kit. These special packages include a camera body and battery grip (the Silver Premium Kit comes with a silver camera body and a silver battery grip that is exclusive to this package), plus an exclusive leather strap and a spare battery. The specifications of the limited-edition models are identical to those of the PENTAX K-3 Mark III. The Premium Kits will be available in late April for the manufacturer’s suggested retail price of $2,299.95.</p> \n  <h3 class=\"p7\">| The Five Principles of PENTAX |</h3> \n  <ol> \n   <li class=\"p8\">We design new cameras through sheer devotion.</li> \n   <li class=\"p8\">Our goal is to produce cameras with the power to capture images that allow for direct communication with the subject.</li> \n   <li class=\"p8\">We design cameras that allow our users to enjoy all the processes involved in taking a picture.</li> \n   <li class=\"p8\">We pursue a level of quality and performance that can’t be measured by numbers alone.</li> \n   <li class=\"p7\">We respect and value the photographic experiences of our users and view this as an invaluable asset.</li> \n  </ol> \n  <h3 class=\"p7\">| Main features of the PENTAX K-3 Mark III |</h3> \n  <p class=\"p7\"><strong>1</strong>．Optical viewfinder with nearly 100% field of view and approximately 1.05-times magnification</p> \n  <p class=\"p7\">The PENTAX K-3 Mark III features an optical viewfinder with a nearly 100-percent field of view and a magnification of approximately 1.05 times. A newly developed, high-refraction glass prism assures comfortable viewing with a wide field of view equivalent to that of a full-frame SLR. Also, by using a distortion-correcting optical element and optimizing the lens coatings, it delivers a clear, true-to-life viewfinder image free of distortion, with brightness improved by nearly 10 percent over the PENTAX K-3 II’s viewfinder. Incorporating a Natural Bright Matte III focusing screen — known for ease of focus during manual-focus shooting — it also delivers a sharp, clear subject image with faithful reproduction of the <em>bokeh </em>(defocus) effect. In addition, its transparent display lets the user monitor a wide range of operational data in the viewfinder window.</p> \n  <p class=\"p7\"><strong>2</strong>．High-resolution images assured by approximately 25.73 effective megapixels and super-high-sensitivity photography at a top sensitivity of ISO 1600000</p> \n  <p class=\"p7\">As part of its passion for higher image quality, PENTAX equipped the PENTAX K-3 Mark III with a back-illuminated CMOS image sensor with approximately 25.73 effective megapixels. By coupling this sensor with an AA (anti-aliasing)-filter-free optical design, the camera produces super-high-resolution images. PENTAX also renewed all key devices, including the newly developed, high-performance PRIME V imaging engine and new-generation accelerator unit to deliver well-defined images with minimal noise, while retaining high-resolution reproduction at all sensitivities — even in the super-low or super-high range. Also, by greatly improving the noise-reduction performance at high-sensitivity ranges, it boasts a top sensitivity of ISO 1600000 to extend the range of scenes that can be photographed.</p> \n  <p class=\"p7\"><strong>3</strong>．Pentax SR II Shake Reduction System delivers high-performance, 5-Axis, 5.5-shutter-step camera shake compensation</p> \n  <p class=\"p7\" style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">(1) In-body SR mechanism, compatible with all mountable lenses<span class=\"green\">*</span></p> \n  <p class=\"p7\" style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">The built-in SR II shake-reduction mechanism means that the PENTAX K-3 Mark III effectively minimizes camera shake and delivers sharp, blur-free images, even in camera-shake-prone conditions such as when using a telephoto lens, shooting low-light scenes without flash illumination, or photographing sunset scenes. In addition to horizontal and vertical camera shake caused by pitch and yaw, this five-axis mechanism compensates for camera shake caused by horizontal and vertical shift (often generated in macro photography) and camera shake caused by roll. It assures a compensation effect of approximately 5.5 shutter steps（CIPA standard compliant, HD PENTAX-DA 16-85mm F3.5-5.6ED DC WR、f = 85mm） — the highest level in PENTAX history — to expand the limits of handheld photography. This mechanism also provides a new Panning mode to capture sharp, clear images of slow-moving subjects.</p> \n  <p class=\"p7\" style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">(2) Pixel-Shift Resolution System</p> \n  <p class=\"p7\" style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">This innovative system captures four images of the same scene by shifting the image sensor by a single pixel for each image, then synthesizes them into a single composite image. Compared to the conventional Bayer system, in which each pixel has only a single color-data unit, this system obtains all color data in each pixel and delivers super-high-resolution images with more truthful colors and much finer details than those produced by the conventional system. To make this system more useful with a wider range of scenes and subjects, the camera provides ON/OFF switching of the Motion Correction function, which automatically detects only moving elements of the image during continuous shooting and minimizes negative effects during the synthesizing process.</p> \n  <p class=\"p7\" style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">(3) AA-filter simulator to minimize moiré and false color<span class=\"green\">**</span></p> \n  <p class=\"p7\" style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">The PENTAX K-3 Mark III features an AA (anti-aliasing)-filter simulator, which effectively reduces moiré patterns to the same level as an optical AA filter, by applying microscopic vibrations to the image sensor at the sub-pixel-level during exposure. Unlike a conventional optical AA filer, this innovative, PENTAX-original simulator provides ON/FF switching and level selection to assure the optimal filter effect for a given subject or photographic condition.</p> \n  <p class=\"p7\"><strong>4</strong>．High-definition LCD monitor with intuitive touch-screen control</p> \n  <p class=\"p7\">The PENTAX K-3 Mark III features a high-definition, 3.2-inch LCD monitor with approximately 1,620,000 pixels. Incorporating touch-screen control for the first time in the PENTAX K series, this monitor provides intuitive operation of monitor functions, including menu selection and image zooming during playback. Its air-gapless construction, in which a special resin material is injected into the gap between LCD layers and a protective tempered-glass cover, effectively reduces reflections and the dispersion of light to improve visibility during outdoor shooting. The viewfinder eyepiece is designed to protrude away from the LCD monitor screen, so the user’s nose does not contact the camera body. Positioned at the bottom of the eyepiece is an eye sensor, which turns the monitor off the moment the photographer looks into the viewfinder, preventing monitor illumination from affecting visibility during shooting.</p> \n  <p class=\"p7\"><strong>5</strong>．SAFOX 13 autofocus system with 101 focus sensors</p> \n  <p class=\"p7\">The PENTAX K-3 Mark III features a newly developed SAFOX 13 phase-matching AF sensor module for dependable, high-precision autofocus operations. It has 101 focus sensors, 25 of which are cross-type sensors positioned in the middle, to assure pinpoint focus on the subject at minimum brightness levels as low as -4 EV.<span class=\"green\">***</span> Also, by featuring a new, high-capacity RGBIr image sensor with approximately 307,000 pixels and a newly developed image-tracking algorithm, the camera also assures accurate tracking of subjects moving at varying speed or in irregular motion. A newly installed AF point selector lever allows the user to select the desired focus point more intuitively (up to 41 points).</p> \n  <p class=\"p7\"><strong>6</strong>．PENTAX Real-time Scene Analysis System, supported by the latest artificial intelligence technology</p> \n  <p class=\"p7\">Supported by the combination of the new, high-density RGBIr image sensor and the high-performance PRIME V imaging engine, the PENTAX Real-time Scene Analysis System instantly detects the subject’s face and eyes using the advanced image recognition technology, then makes real-time analysis of their movement. This assists the camera in optimizing exposure settings and improving autofocusing accuracy. By adopting Deep Learning<span class=\"green\">****</span> — the latest, much-publicized artificial intelligence technology — the PENTAX K-3 Mark III assures more accurate subject detection and more reliable scene judgment.</p> \n  <p class=\"p7\"><strong>7</strong>．High-speed continuous shooting at a top speed of approximately 12 images per second</p> \n  <p class=\"p7\">Thanks to a newly developed mirror-driving mechanism assuring high-speed, high-accuracy control of the mirror and shutter mechanisms, and the high-performance PRIME V imaging engine that performs high-speed data transmission, the PENTAX K-3 Mark III provides high-speed drive continuous shooting — with a maximum speed of approximately 12 images per second in the AF.S mode, or approximately 11 images per second in the AF.C mode.</p> \n  <p class=\"p7\"><strong>8</strong>．User-friendly shooting functions to improve shooting efficiency and operability</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li class=\"p7\">PENTAX-exclusive Hyper Operation system, featuring a new Advanced mode for more flexible exposure control.</li> \n   <li class=\"p7\">Operation Control Lock function, to prevent accidental operational errors of exposure-setting buttons and the four-way controller.</li> \n   <li class=\"p7\">New-generation Smart Function with the dedicated Smart Function button, for speedy selection and setting of various functions without the need of switching on-screen menus.</li> \n   <li class=\"p7\">Button Customization function, to assign user-selected functions to 10 different control buttons.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p class=\"p7\"><strong>9</strong>．Compact, sturdy body with dustproof, weather-resistant construction</p> \n  <p class=\"p7\">The PENTAX K-3 Mark III’s top, bottom, front and rear panels are all made of lightweight, high-rigidity magnesium alloy. Coupled with a dustproof, weather-resistant construction with special seals applied to crucial parts of the camera body, and outstanding cold-resistant performance to ensure stable operation at -10°C, the camera is designed to be extremely durable and dependable even in harsh environmental conditions, such as when shooting in the rain, or at dust-prone or low-temperature locations. The camera also features a durable, dependable shutter unit — verified in an endurance test of 300,000 shutter-release actions — to perfect the rugged body for worry-free shooting at any location.</p> \n  <p class=\"p7\"><strong>10</strong>．4K-resolution movie recording with a range of functional settings</p> \n  <p class=\"p7\">The PENTAX K-3 Mark III captures 4K-resolution movie clips (3840 x 2160 pixels; 30p/24p frame rate) or Full HD movie clips (1920 x 1080 pixels; 60p/30p/24p frame rate) in the H-264 recording format. Equipped with a stereo microphone input terminal and headset terminal, it also allows the user to manually set the audio recording level and monitor the sound pressure level for microphone input. Thanks to quiet touch-screen control on the LCD monitor positioned on its back panel, the desired shooting function and exposure compensation level can be set without worrying about operational noise.</p> \n  <p class=\"p7\"><strong>11</strong>．Bluetooth® and Wireless LAN connection</p> \n  <p class=\"p7\">The PENTAX K-3 Mark III provides two wireless interface options — Bluetooth® and Wireless LAN — for connection with mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets.

rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Canon Europe</a> has opened the application period for its annual grant that aims to give two professional photographers a boost for a new project. The two grants on offer are the Canon Female Photojournalist Grant and the Canon Video Grant — both of which finance the successful applicant to the tune of €8,000 (~$9,400).</p> \n<p>To apply, you must be able to prove you are a professional, and you’ll be expected to produce a detailed plan for the project you want to shoot. Projects should cover ‘social, economic, political or cultural subject in a journalistic manner’ and the results will be presented at the <a href=\"https://www.visapourlimage.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Visa pour l’Image photography festival</a> in France September 2022. While both winners can expect support from Canon to complete and publicise their projects the winner of the Video Grant will also have access to a loan of a Canon camera and two lenses to the value of €15,000.</p> \n<p>Although the initiative is run by Canon Europe, there are no geographic restrictions on who can apply for the grants. For more information see the <a href=\"https://www.canon-europe.com/pro/events/visa-pour-l-image/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Canon website</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.visapourlimage.com/en\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Visa pour I’Image</a> website and the rules for the <a href=\"https://www.visapourlimage.com/files/b1285e3d/downloadcanonvideograntrules.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Canon Video Grant</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.visapourlimage.com/files/28210f87/downloadcanonfemalegrantrules.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Canon Female Photojournalist Grant</a>.</p> \n<p>Press release:</p> \n<div id=\"pr\" class=\"pressRelease\"> \n <h2>Canon searches for the best in photojournalism at Visa pour l’Image 2021</h2> \n <p>Canon Europe today announces the launch of its annual photojournalism grants, in search for standout professional photographers and videographers. Championing creative storytellers, the Canon Female Photojournalist Grant celebrates an outstanding photographer in recognition of her contribution to photojournalism; whilst the Canon Video Grant acknowledges those wanting to magnify a social, cultural or economic issue in documentary form. Run in conjunction with Visa pour l’Image, one of the world’s leading photojournalism festivals, both grants give recipients the funding to pursue their project alongside a platform to be heard. The winners will be officially presented at this year’s festival, which takes place during September in Perpignan, France, with their work showcased the following year.</p> \n <p><strong>Canon Video Grant – Short Film Documentary</strong><br>Celebrating creative documentary making and recognising the best emerging talent, this year marks the second Canon Video Grant. The winner will be selected by a jury of professional figures in the world of photography in June and awarded a grant of €8,000 plus the loan of Canon kit to support the production of a short-film documentary. Entries will be judged on the presentation, relevance and originality of their project. <br> <br>Last year, French-Swiss photographer and filmmaker Michaël Zumstein was awarded the Canon Video Grant – the first-ever recipient. He has since commenced work on a short documentary called Bangui la coquette, looking at the organisation of Miss Central African Republic. A first teaser of his project will be presented at this year’s festival, with the complete and final video report screened in Perpignan one year later, in September 2022.<br> <br>Entries for the Canon Video Grant are now open to professional photojournalists or documentary video makers with at least one video reportage project under their belt. <br> <br><strong>Canon Female Photojournalism Grant</strong><br>Now in its 21st year, the prestigious Canon Female Photojournalist Grant brings visibility to important societal topics through photojournalism. Canon and Visa pour I’Image will be presenting the €8,000 grant at this year’s festival, supporting the winning photographer with her year-long project ahead of their exhibition the following year. <br> <br>Due to the global impact of the pandemic, last year’s recipient of the grant - Turkish photographer Sabiha Çimen – will also be showcasing her project, Hafiz: Guardians of the Qur'an, at the 2022 festival. Çimen’s project focuses on a 1,500-year-old tradition – where Muslims who completely memorise the Qur'an are then allowed to use the title 'Haf?z' before their names – and the 8 to 17-year-old girls who attend the Qur'an schools to recite and memorise the 6,236 verses of the holy book of Islam so they can become Hafizas.<br> <br>Past recipients of the grant have received funding, support, and exposure, as well becoming a source of inspiration for other female photographers in the industry. Ilvy Njiokiktjien, winner of the 2011 grant and Canon Ambassador, says: “It has made a big difference in my career. I would encourage other female journalists to apply, because the possibility of having a show at Visa pour l’Image is huge. The attention that Canon and the festival bring to your project is beyond what others could do. It puts the project, and therefore you as a photographer, in the spotlight, something which is greatly needed in today’s industry.”</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p> \n</div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 30 Mar 2021 15:08:00 +0000","feedId":70,"bgimg":"https://1.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS590x0~articles/4219770882/canon-pro-photojournalism-video-grant-1-fe4cf6c0-5c75-11ea-926f-b083fea0059b.jpeg","linkMd5":"08f0357f1145a9487acec7d7fb969808","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn4@2020_4/2021/04/03/04-49-49-723_5fe20b087b7d30f1.webp","destWidth":590,"destHeight":393,"sourceBytes":82583,"destBytes":44790,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://1.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS590x0~articles/4219770882/canon-pro-photojournalism-video-grant-1-fe4cf6c0-5c75-11ea-926f-b083fea0059b.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn4@2020_4/2021/04/03/04-49-49-723_5fe20b087b7d30f1.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617425389030},{"createdTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:49","updatedTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:49","title":"DPReview TV: How a crappy camera made Jordan a better videographer","link":"https://www.dpreview.com/videos/9253728193/dpreview-tv-how-a-crappy-camera-made-jordan-a-better-videographer","description":"<div class=\"video\"> \n <iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"326\" id=\"videoFrame\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/W8fJWjmqAgQ?rel=0&amp;autohide=1&amp;wmode=transparent&amp;enablejsapi=1\" width=\"580\"></iframe> \n</div> \n<p>Jordan promised to shoot four DPReview TV episodes with the Pentax K-01 if we reached 300,000 YouTube subscribers by February 14th of this year.

Among the topics discussed were Panasonic's approach to developing cameras for both photographers and videographers, upcoming improvements to autofocus, and the future of Micro Four Thirds.</p> \n<p><em>Please note that this interview was conducted over email and has been edited for grammar, clarity and flow.</em></p> \n<hr> \n <h3>With much of Panasonic's recent efforts focused on full-frame camera systems, what does the future of Micro Four Thirds look like?</h3> \n <p>We will strengthen our product lineup in both full-frame and Micro Four Thirds in order to support all shooting opportunities for creators. We have full-frame for creators who want more power to capture images and videos with a shallow depth of field, and M43 for creators who want compactness, light weight, mobility, and an adequate depth of field. The product group consists of two systems with different characteristics, which supports various shooting scenes and demonstrates the creator's imagination.</p> \n <blockquote class=\"pullQuote\">\n   Many creators have high expectations for new M43 products [and] we will continue to strengthen the lineup from this year onwards \n </blockquote> \n <p>Last year, we introduced the Lumix DC-S5, which has a compact and lightweight body and high performance in both still images and videos. On the other hand, in M43, in addition to the GH5, GH5S, and G9 we introduced the Lumix DC-G100, which is highly portable and allows you to enjoy vlogging, and the box-style camera the Lumix DC-BGH1, which increases flexibility in video production and has excellent video performance and customizability. M43 has a wide range of uses, and many creators have high expectations for new M43 products. We will continue to strengthen the lineup from this year onwards.</p> \n <h3>In terms of lenses, how are Panasonic’s efforts allocated between its full-frame and four thirds systems?</h3> \n <p>Since the launch of the S series, we have focused on developing full-frame lenses with the highest priority given to the early enhancement of the lineup. First of all, for professionals who are the target of the S series, we will enhance the S Pro lens range to deliver high performance that covers a wide range of focal lengths. And after the release of the S5 last year, we enhanced the range of lenses by achieving both compactness, light weight, high performance and an affordable price with our upcoming series of F1.8 primes as well as the recently introduced 20-60mm.</p> \n <p>As for M43 lenses, we now offer 31 lenses, which are useful for various scenes, and in the future, we are planning to develop more lenses that meet the needs of creators regardless of whether they shoot M43 or full-frame.</p> \n <h3>Are you working on improving DFD to make it more competitive with phase-detection AF from other brands?</h3> \n <p>Autofocus is a technology that is constantly advancing. With the recently released Lumix DC-S5, we have evolved the DFD algorithm based on the needs and feedback of creators, and we have received a positive response from the market following the release. However, we recognize that there are still issues that need to be improved to reach perfection when it comes to AF. We are currently considering further improvements, such as improving the processing capacity with new hardware and improving the accuracy with new software algorithms. Please look forward to the evolution of our AF in the future.</p> \n <h3>Faster sensor readout would improve rolling shutter and help you further improve DFD. Will Micro Four Thirds always offer this kind of speed advantage over full-frame?</h3> \n <p>Compared to full-frame sensors, M43 sensors are easier to read out quickly, and they consume less power. This is one of the reasons why we have been able to keep our video features one step ahead. The higher the speed, the better the high-speed shooting performance, the less rolling shutter distortion, and the more potential for autofocus performance improvements. We would like to take advantage of [the potential for higher-speed sensor readout in M43] and continue to take advantage of the unique features of M43 to create attractive products that will please our end users.</p> \n <table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"images noCrop singleNoBorder center\" data-image-height=\"null\" data-image-width=\"590\"> \n  <tbody> \n   <tr> \n    <td class=\"image\" style=\"width: 590px;\"><a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/files/p/articles/8480678649/Panasonic_BGH1_10-20mm_battery-1.jpeg\" target=\"article-8480678649\"><img border=\"0\" data-thumbnail-height=\"0\" data-thumbnail-width=\"590\" height=\"393\" src=\"https://2.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS590x0~articles/8480678649/Panasonic_BGH1_10-20mm_battery-1.jpeg\" width=\"590\" data-filename=\"Panasonic_BGH1_10-20mm_battery-1.jpeg\" /></a></td> \n   </tr> \n   <tr> \n    <td class=\"caption\" style=\"width: 590px;\">The Panasonic Lumix DC-BGH1 is a Micro four Thirds 'box camera' designed to be used as a module in various types of rig, including potentially mounted to a drone.

What has the market response to these features been, and can we expect to see further development and innovation along these lines?</h3> \n <p>We have announced cameras with Post-Focus, which allows you to select the focus position after shooting, and Focus Stacking, which allows you to adjust the depth by combining photos with different focus positions. And these were appreciated by end-users. In addition, a high-resolution mode enables G9, S1 series, and S5 users to capture high-resolution images (S1/S1H/S5: 96MP, S1R: 180MP) by synthesizing multiple photos. This has been valued by users who capture landscape and architecture.</p> \n <blockquote class=\"pullQuote\">\n   If we can utilize computational methods while improving the quality of videos, we have the potential to create even more value \n </blockquote> \n <p>Smartphones have been implementing similar functionalities recently. We believe that realizing these consumer trends in cameras will bring even deeper value to customers and we will continue to evolve them.</p> \n <h3>Can we expect to see computational methods applied to video? (For example, to decouple motion blur from shutter angle, or other clever techniques?)</h3> \n <p>We do not deny that as a possibility. As an example, our camcorders are already equipped with functions such as generating HDR images based on multiple images with different exposure times. On the other hand, in these days when mirrorless cameras are used for high-end video production, I think the point is whether we can meet the quality required by the market or not, so careful research is required. If we can utilize computational methods while improving the quality of videos, we have the potential to create even more value.</p> \n <h3>Is it possible that we'll see internal Raw video capture in Panasonic cameras in the near future?</h3> \n <p>We cannot answer about future products. But of course, we feel that demand for Raw recording is increasing, and we need to develop products with that in consideration.</p> \n <table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"images noCrop singleNoBorder center\" data-image-height=\"null\" data-image-width=\"590\"> \n  <tbody> \n   <tr> \n    <td class=\"image\" style=\"width: 590px;\"><a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/files/p/articles/8480678649/Panasonic-S5-cards.jpeg\" target=\"article-8480678649\"><img border=\"0\" data-thumbnail-height=\"0\" data-thumbnail-width=\"590\" height=\"393\" src=\"https://1.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS590x0~articles/8480678649/Panasonic-S5-cards.jpeg\" width=\"590\" data-filename=\"Panasonic-S5-cards.jpeg\" /></a></td> \n   </tr> \n   <tr> \n    <td class=\"caption\" style=\"width: 590px;\">The Lumix DC-S5 (pictured above) and the S1H both use twin SD card slots, but the S1 and S1R offer dual SD and XQD/CFexpress slots. According to Mr Yamane, it's the heat buildup of current CFe interfaces which makes that media problematic for long-duration video shooting, but efficiencies in future developments of CFe can be expected to mitigate the issue.</td> \n   </tr> \n  </tbody> \n </table> \n <h3>We've seen the adoption of CFexpress take off, but other devices are starting to plug directly to SSDs. Which makes most sense for video?</h3> \n <p>It is interesting question, and both have their strengths. There is no doubt that the mobility of a mirrorless camera is maximized by small, in-camera storage. CFexpress is valuable in that aspect. On the other hand, the current CFexpress consumes a lot of power during high-speed writing. This is no problem with still images, but with videos it can cause the camera to heat up, and there is a concern that it will limit the recording time. As the bit rate gets higher, the risk of that happening will be higher as well.</p> \n <blockquote class=\"pullQuote\">\n   We believe that the ideal solution is in-camera storage like CFexpress for video recording \n </blockquote> \n <p>Recording to an external SSD is one solution to the heat issue caused by internal recording. Connections with USB cables however would be a problem for those who need mobility. Even if a cartridge type is used, the whole setup will be huge. We therefore believe that the ideal solution is in-camera storage like CFexpress for video recording. It is expected that innovations will happen in future around lower power consumption of CFexpress, especially for long time video shooting.</p> \n <h3>Who do you see as the main audience for your video products? Consumers learning video, or professionals using them alongside Varicam models?</h3> \n <p>The main targets of video are both professional videographers and general consumers who personally enjoy capturing video. Our flagship full-frame video camera, the DC-S1H, has been approved by Netflix, and is already utilized on many video production projects including movies, dramas, and commercials. In addition, the GH series - our flagship M43 video cameras - are being used by many YouTubers. Furthermore, the box-type M43 video camera BGH1 has also been approved by Netflix, and we are approaching a wide range of end-users by supporting scenarios such as multi-angle shooting, live streaming, and drone shooting. We will continue to develop new products that can be used for various video shooting needs by a variety of customers.</p> \n <blockquote class=\"pullQuote\">\n   We are approaching a wide range of end-users by supporting scenarios such as multi-angle shooting, live streaming, and drone shooting \n </blockquote> \n <p>We recently announced several major firmware updates on March 17th. We added enhanced video functions to the Lumix DC-S1 such as 6K/C4K/4K60P, 10-bit/4K anamorphic video recording, and we also added RAW video output functionality via HDMI (with additional functions via the DMW-SFU2 Filmmaker Upgrade Software Key). The S1H supports Raw data output via HDMI to Blackmagic Design recorders, and the BGH1 supports IP streaming output and video Raw data output via HDMI. We are looking forward to seeing the videos shot with these advanced features!</p> \n <h3>What are the main features and improvements that your customers are asking for from your video products?</h3> \n <p>We cannot answer in detail, but we believe that our GH series and S1H have been highly rated for their functions / performance, such as unlimited video recording time and various shooting assist functions. We have been able to obtain a lot of feedback from customers who are using Lumix products in various ways. We will continue to listen to the customers who use our products, and solve any problems that they may have. In the future, we will continue to refine our features, lead the industry with technologies that expand video expression such as high bit rate and high frame rate, and continue to create cameras that please our customers.</p> \n <table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"images noCrop singleNoBorder center\" data-image-height=\"null\" data-image-width=\"590\"> \n  <tbody> \n   <tr> \n    <td class=\"image\" style=\"width: 590px;\"><a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/files/p/articles/8480678649/5928638018.jpeg\" target=\"article-8480678649\"><img border=\"0\" data-thumbnail-height=\"0\" data-thumbnail-width=\"590\" height=\"396\" src=\"https://2.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS590x0~articles/8480678649/5928638018.jpeg\" width=\"590\" data-filename=\"5928638018.jpeg\" /></a></td> \n   </tr> \n   <tr> \n    <td class=\"caption\" style=\"width: 590px;\">The Lumix DC-G100 is a compact Micro Four Thirds camera aimed at video and stills creators and vloggers.</td> \n   </tr> \n  </tbody> \n </table> \n <h3>What trends do you see in the market, over recent years? Is there still a market for compact cameras, for instance?</h3> \n <p>The global digital camera market has been damaged by COVID-19, but the current trend is improving. However, the market for compact cameras is shrinking. On the other hand, demand for mirrorless cameras has grown steadily, especially for video production and live streaming, and demands are diversified. Under these circumstances, the role of mirrorless cameras will expand.</p> \n <p>To respond to this, we will strengthen both full-frame and M43. In 2020, we responded to growing and diversifying demands with the Lumix DC-S5, which offers functions recognized by professionals in a compact and lightweight full-frame body, the M43 G100 for vloggers, the BGH1 box camera, and firmware updates to speedily respond to the market.</p> \n <h3>How do you plan to get your cameras into the hands of younger, smartphone-first customers?</h3> \n <p>We live in an era where people all over the world have smartphones, take photos and videos, and share them. Although the camera performance of smartphones has been improved, there are limits to what smartphones can do. With digital cameras you can take expressive videos and stills that are clearly different from smartphones.</p> \n <blockquote class=\"pullQuote\">\n   The key to survival for the camera market in the future is responding to diversifying needs quickly \n </blockquote> \n <p>Video production by young people is increasing, and low price and easy-to-use mirrorless cameras are attracting attention. In addition, creators want to shoot images that are more advanced and unique. By catering to this need, and strengthening the affinity between our cameras and smartphones, we hope that young people will also take digital cameras in their hands. The key to survival for the camera market in the future is responding to diversifying needs quickly.</p> \n <h3>The Panasonic S1 and S1R launched just over two years ago, how have they been received?</h3> \n <p>The S1R and S1 are products developed for professional photographers and hybrid users without compromise in all aspects. In the market, they have been highly valued for their performance, operability, robustness, and other points required as tools for professional work. In terms of image quality, the color reproduction is particularly appreciated. On the other hand, we received many requests for improvements to AF performance. We have made updates in the S5 with regard to AF tracking, and we expanded these improvements to the S1R and S1 November last year via firmware.</p> \n <h3>Panasonic makes some of the largest, toughest-built mirrorless full-frame cameras on the market, do you see this as a major differentiator between you and your competition?</h3> \n <p>We think one of the major differences between the S series, which was developed for professionals, and [options from] other companies is their durability and robustness, exemplified by the continuous shooting time of videos. In addition, we are also focused on the accuracy of image stabilization and shutter accuracy in actual shooting. Furthermore, the UI was created through interviews with many professionals, so it offers excellent usability.</p> \n <hr> \n  <h3>Editor's note: Barnaby Britton</h3> \n  <p>The two main takeaways from this interview with Mr. Yamane are a recognition of where his company needs to improve (specifically around AF performance in mirrorless bodies) and a commitment to do so, coupled with a concurrent commitment to Micro Four Thirds. This should come as good news to virtually all Panasonic shooters, regardless of which system (or which side of the video/stills divide) they're invested in.</p> \n  <p>Some of the most innovative and pioneering cameras in the early history of consumer digital imaging were launched under Panasonic's Lumix brand. While in recent years more of the most <em>obvious</em> innovations (but by no means all: Panasonic was talking about machine learning before Olympus or Sony) have been in terms of video performance, the company is still releasing excellent enthusiast stills and 'hybrid' cameras. The Lumix DC-S5 is a good example of a camera that takes many of the powerful video features introduced in more expensive models, but packages them in a smaller, more accessible body, aimed more at stills-focused and multimedia shooters.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"pullQuote\">\n    Micro Four Thirds has a lot of advantages for hybrid stills/video use, and high-end video \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Where Panasonic still tends to fall down a little compared to competitors is autofocus performance. Mr. Yamane is refreshingly honest about this, and about the need to improve. He wouldn't be drawn on the long-term future of Panasonic's DFD (depth-from-defocus) technology but his commitment as expressed in this interview to 'improving processing capacity with new hardware and improving the accuracy with new software algorithms' is encouraging.</p> \n  <p>Also encouraging, in this bad-news-biased echo-chamber where dire rumors are constantly circulating about this or that company, or this and that class of cameras being 'dead' is his commitment to Micro Four Thirds.</p> \n  <p>While it seems likely that, long-term, Panasonic will focus its stills photography energies more on full-frame, M43 has a lot of advantages for hybrid stills/video use, and high-end video. Chief among these is an ability to keep the physical size of the body and lens combinations small, and the potential for greater sensor readout speed compared to larger full-frame chips. The boxy, tiny and powerful BGH1 is a good example of a camera that could only exist with a sub full-frame sensor inside it, and it's a safe bet that it won't be a one-off. With Olympus / OM Digital Solutions primarily still focused on stills photographers, and Sony pushing full-frame in its enthusiast and professional video cameras, it seems likely that Panasonic will explore the 'small sensor hybrid camera' niche further in future.</p> \n  <p class=\"actionButton\"><a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/interviews\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Read more

It's built around a 26MP BSI-CMOS sensor and has been redesigned from the ground up to become, on paper, the most capable, most usable K-mount camera ever made.</p> \n<hr> \n <p class=\"newsLink\" id=\"index\"><strong>Jump to:</strong></p> \n <p class=\"newsLink\"><a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/pentax-k-3-mark-iii-initial-review#WN\">What's new</a>| <a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/pentax-k-3-mark-iii-initial-review#HC\">How it compares</a> | <a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/pentax-k-3-mark-iii-initial-review#BH\">Body and handling</a> | <a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/pentax-k-3-mark-iii-initial-review#II\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Initial impressions</a> | <a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/pentax-k-3-mark-iii-initial-review/2\">Specifications</a></p> \n <hr> \n  <p>Although it shares much of its styling with the K-3 II, launched in 2015, the third iteration has been significantly redesigned and re-thought to offer improvements across the board. From the viewfinder and the sensor right down to the shutter button, it's essentially an all-new DSLR.</p> \n  <h3>Key specifications</h3> \n  <ul> \n   <li>25.7MP BSI-CMOS sensor</li> \n   <li>SAFOX 13 AF module with 101 AF points (25 cross-type)</li> \n   <li>5-axis in-body stabilization rated to 5.5EV</li> \n   <li>Weather-sealed magnesium alloy construction</li> \n   <li>Viewfinder with 1.05x magnification</li> \n   <li>Revised three-dial control system</li> \n   <li>8-direction AF joystick and touchscreen for AF positioning</li> \n   <li>UHD 4K movie capture at up to 30p</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>In addition, the K-3 III has all the usual modes making clever use of the image stabilization system, including Anti-Aliasing Filter Simulation and the multi-shot Pixel Shift Resolution mode that shoots and combines four offset images to cancel out the Bayer pattern and remove the need for sharpness-sapping demosaicing.</p> \n  <p>The K-3 III will be available from late April in a choice of black or silver with a recommended price of $2000. A weather-sealed D-BG8 battery grip with matched controls will also be available. A kit combining the body and grip (along with a strap and additional battery) is priced at $2300.</p> \n  <hr> \n   <h2 id=\"WN\" style=\"margin-top: 8%;\">What's new...</h2> \n   <h3>Sensor</h3> \n   <p>At the heart of the K-3 III is a new BSI CMOS APS-C sensor. Ricoh describes it as a 25MP chip, but the cameras resolution is actually 25.7MP, raising the possibility that it's related to the one using in Fujifilm's X-T4 (albeit with a more conventional color filter array and no pixels masked for phase detection).</p> \n   <p>Either way, the sensor has no anti-aliasing filter and is capable of 14-bit readout at up to 12 fps. Ricoh says the new sensor has better high ISO noise characteristics than the 24MP chip in the KP and that this combines with improved processing power from its PRIME V processor and 'Accelerators Unit II' pre-processor to give better detail retention and noise reduction in low-light conditions. Though this could well mean noise reduction applied in to Raw data, as it did with the K-1 Mark II.</p> \n   <p>The camera can shoot at up to ISO 1,600,000.</p> \n   <h3>Viewfinder</h3> \n   <table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"images noCaptions noCrop singleNoBorder center\" data-image-height=\"null\" data-image-width=\"590\"> \n    <tbody> \n     <tr> \n      <td class=\"image\" style=\"width: 590px;\"><a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/files/p/articles/4879007131/Pentax_K-3_III_pentaprism.jpeg\" target=\"article-4879007131\"><img border=\"0\" data-thumbnail-height=\"0\" data-thumbnail-width=\"590\" height=\"393\" src=\"https://2.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS590x0~articles/4879007131/Pentax_K-3_III_pentaprism.jpeg\" width=\"590\" data-filename=\"Pentax_K-3_III_pentaprism.jpeg\" /></a></td> \n     </tr> \n    </tbody> \n   </table> \n   <p>One of the most significant revisions in the K-3 III is an all-new viewfinder. Building on a Pentax tradition of large, prism-type viewfinders, the K-3 III's viewfinder is a pentaprism offering an impressive 1.05x magnification.</p> \n   <blockquote class=\"pullQuote\">\n     Ricoh says the K-3 III's viewfinder has a 10% improvement in brightness over the Mark II \n   </blockquote> \n   <p>Viewfinder magnification figures are usually calculated with 50mm lenses, regardless of sensor size, so some of that high figure comes from the apparent magnification of the camera's APS-C sensor. But, even taking this into account, it would be equivalent to a 0.68x magnification finder on full-frame, making it only a fraction smaller than the 0.70x finder in the Pentax K-1 models. That's small by the standards of many mirrorless cameras, in which viewfinder size isn't dependent on the viewing angle of the sensor, but is the largest ever fitted to an APS-C DSLR.</p> \n   <p>More than just the size, the new finder has been designed using a transparent display panel in the viewing path, rather than having the display of a separate panel projected into the finder, as was the case in previous K-3s. Ricoh says this change provides a 10% improvement in brightness over the Mark II. It also allows more flexibility in display customization.</p> \n   <h3>New Autofocus module</h3> \n   <p>Ricoh has developed a completely new AF module for the K-3 III. The Safox 13 has 101 AF points, 25 of which are cross-type. 41 of the AF points can be manually selected and the centermost nine points can focus at down to -4EV when paired with lenses that are F2.8 or brighter.</p> \n   <p>The optics in front of the lens module expand the coverage of AF points to be 20% wider in the frame than the Safox 11 module in the K-3 II.</p> \n   <p>On top of this, the camera's continuous AF system has been completely reworked. The K-3 II uses a 307k-pixel RGB+IR metering sensor that provides the AF system with a higher-resolution view of the subject for subject recognition and tracking. A review of the predictive AF algorithms and the deep-learning-trained ability to recognize faces, eyes and subjects such as birds promises improved AF-C performance in a range of situations.</p> \n   <h3>Improved in-body stabilization</h3> \n   <table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"images noCaptions noCrop singleNoBorder center\" data-image-height=\"null\" data-image-width=\"590\"> \n    <tbody> \n     <tr> \n      <td class=\"image\" style=\"width: 590px;\"><a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/files/p/articles/4879007131/Pentax_K-3_III_70mm_Limited_Lens.jpeg\" target=\"article-4879007131\"><img border=\"0\" data-thumbnail-height=\"0\" data-thumbnail-width=\"590\" height=\"393\" src=\"https://2.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS590x0~articles/4879007131/Pentax_K-3_III_70mm_Limited_Lens.jpeg\" width=\"590\" data-filename=\"Pentax_K-3_III_70mm_Limited_Lens.jpeg\" /></a></td> \n     </tr> \n    </tbody> \n   </table> \n   <p>In-body stabilization is no longer the rarity it was when Pentax first introduced its <a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/pentaxk100d\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Shake Reduction system</a>, and the K-3 III's system has been re-worked to keep up with the competition.</p> \n   <p>The five-axis 'SR II' IS system is rated at 5.5EV, using CIPA standard testing, which is a 1.0EV improvement over the rated performance of the K-3 II, and 0.5EV more than the K-1 Mark II. A dedicated 'SR' button lets you switch the camera between the default Auto mode, off, or 'Panning' mode, which lets you adjust the response, if the Auto mode isn't correctly detecting slow, intentional panning movements.</p> \n   <h3>Shutter mechanism</h3> \n   <p>As with all the other major components of the camera, the K-3 III's shutter mechanism has been completely reworked. It uses a coreless motor to drive both its shutter and mirror mechanisms, improving response times. The mirror mechanism has been made lighter, to reduce inertia.</p> \n   <p>The redesign means the mirror settles quicker, giving shorter viewfinder blackout times and giving the AF and metering systems more time to assess the scene between shots. This helps support the camera's ability to shoot at up to 12 fps (11 fps with continuous autofocus).</p> \n   <p>The shutter unit is rated to withstand 300,000 releases, and the adoption of a leaf switch mechanism under the shutter button helps give a smoother response as well as increased durability to match.</p> \n   <h3>4K capture</h3> \n   <table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"images noCaptions noCrop singleNoBorder center\" data-image-height=\"null\" data-image-width=\"590\"> \n    <tbody> \n     <tr> \n      <td class=\"image\" style=\"width: 590px;\"><a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/files/p/articles/4879007131/Pentax_K-3_Mark_III_ports.jpeg\" target=\"article-4879007131\"><img border=\"0\" data-thumbnail-height=\"0\" data-thumbnail-width=\"590\" height=\"393\" src=\"https://1.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS590x0~articles/4879007131/Pentax_K-3_Mark_III_ports.jpeg\" width=\"590\" data-filename=\"Pentax_K-3_Mark_III_ports.jpeg\" /></a></td> \n     </tr> \n    </tbody> \n   </table> \n   <p>The K-3 III becomes the first K-mount camera to offer 4K video capture. It can shoot UHD 4K at up to 30p and includes touchscreen control to avoid adding noise during recording.</p> \n   <p>Ricoh says the new IS system is quiet enough to be used during video capture, meaning the K-3 III is able to offer 3-axis (Roll, pitch and yaw) correction using mechanical stabilization, rather than the digital IS used in previous models.</p> \n   <p><a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/pentax-k-3-mark-iii-initial-review#index\"><strong>Return to index</strong></a></p> \n   <hr> \n    <h2 id=\"HC\" style=\"margin-top: 8%;\">How it compares...</h2> \n    <p>It's fair to say that the APS-C DSLR market is not what it once was. So we've tried to include meaningful reference points, however you choose to look at the K-3 III.</p> \n    <p>If you're in the market for an enthusiast-level APS-C camera, Fujifilm's X-T4 is the one to beat. If you're not set on an APS-C sensor then you can get the very capable Nikon Z6 II for a similar amount of money. If it has to be a DSLR, then Nikon's D500 remains an impressive contender, but if you have K-mount lenses you need to use, the K-1 Mark II is also worth a look.</p> \n    <div class=\"contentTable\">

The K-1 II will offer better image quality if you mount full-frame lenses (and what are likely to be pretty competitive, albeit ~15MP, images when cropped to APS-C), but it uses an older AF system, can't shoot as fast, is heavier and can't shoot 4K video. The full-frame Nikon will again offer better image quality and has a very capable AF system. The Fujifilm can shoot faster and has a much better video spec, but like the Nikon can't offer the longer battery life or optical viewfinder of a DSLR.</p> \n    <p>Essentially, it's impossible to say whether the K-3 III makes sense for you without knowing why you're considering it. However, what should be clear is that it's a well-specced machine even compared with the latest mirrorless rivals, which means it's a fair step forward from older APS-C Pentaxes.</p> \n    <p><a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/pentax-k-3-mark-iii-initial-review#index\"><strong>Return to index</strong></a></p> \n    <hr> \n     <h2 id=\"BH\" style=\"margin-top: 8%;\">Body and handling</h2> \n     <table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"images noCaptions noCrop singleNoBorder center\" data-image-height=\"\" data-image-width=\"590\"> \n      <tbody> \n       <tr> \n        <td class=\"image\" style=\"width: 590px;\"><a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/files/p/articles/4879007131/Pentax_K-3_III_70mm_Limited.jpeg\" target=\"article-4879007131\"><img border=\"0\" data-thumbnail-height=\"0\" data-thumbnail-width=\"590\" height=\"393\" src=\"https://3.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS590x0~articles/4879007131/Pentax_K-3_III_70mm_Limited.jpeg\" width=\"590\" data-filename=\"Pentax_K-3_III_70mm_Limited.jpeg\" /></a></td> \n       </tr> \n      </tbody> \n     </table> \n     <p>The K-3 III iterates on the ergonomics of the exiting K-3 models, which we've frequently praised.

And, of course, it offers the extensive weather-sealing Pentax cameras have become known for.</p> \n     <p>The handgrip and dial position will be immediately familiar to Pentax shooters: it's a camera that feels immediately comfortable in the hand.</p> \n     <h3>Smart function button</h3> \n     <p>The K-3 III iterates on the 'Function Dial' concept of the K-1 II. This adds an extra dial to the camera's top plate, just forward of its rear command dial, which can be used to quickly access camera functions beyond the basic exposure controls of the two main command dials.</p> \n     <table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"images noCaptions noCrop singleNoBorder center\" data-image-height=\"null\" data-image-width=\"590\"> \n      <tbody> \n       <tr> \n        <td class=\"image\" style=\"width: 590px;\"><a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/files/p/articles/4879007131/Pentax_K-3_Mark_III_dials.jpeg\" target=\"article-4879007131\"><img border=\"0\" data-thumbnail-height=\"0\" data-thumbnail-width=\"590\" height=\"393\" src=\"https://4.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS590x0~articles/4879007131/Pentax_K-3_Mark_III_dials.jpeg\" width=\"590\" data-filename=\"Pentax_K-3_Mark_III_dials.jpeg\" /></a></td> \n       </tr> \n      </tbody> \n     </table> \n     <p>Rather than having a fourth dial to dictate the action of the Function Dial, the K-3 III has a button that cycles the dial's function between the options custom assigned to it.

It's a fixed panel, offering no articulation or movement, but it's touch-sensitive in all the ways that make sense in a DSLR. In live view mode it can be used to position the AF point, position the AF point and focus, or position, acquire focus and fire the shutter. It can do similar things in movie mode and these settings can be defined separately.</p> \n     <p>The camera's menus have been redesigned to make them touch operable and you can make all the expected pinch-to-zoom and swipe-to-scroll movements that you might expect in image playback mode.</p> \n     <p>The K-3 III's viewfinder has an eye sensor that switching off the screen when you put your eye to the camera.

We also know that the Pentax system has a dedicated following who want to know about it, so we've tried to provide as much detail as is currently possible.</p> \n      <blockquote class=\"pullQuote\">\n        It's clear Ricoh's engineers have looked at every detail and asked 'what could be done to make this better?' \n      </blockquote> \n      <p>Alongside this announcement, there'll no doubt be plenty of YouTube videos ridiculing the idea of spending so much time and effort developing an enthusiast DSLR in what could be seen as the post-DSLR era. But that's not the way I see things. I'm no Shakespearean scholar: I come not to bury the K-3 III, but to praise it. In concept at least.</p> \n      <p>When we reviewed the Nikon D850, it struck me that it might be the pinnacle of DSLR design. In part because it was so good in so many ways but also because, with the exception of a few models for the pro-sport/photojournalism niche, it seemed unlikely that there'd be many contenders for its crown.</p> \n      <p>I can't yet say how well Ricoh has done in this regard, but it's clear that its engineers have looked at every detail of the K-3 II and asked 'what could be done to make this better?'</p> \n      <table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"images noCrop singleNoBorder center\" data-image-height=\"null\" data-image-width=\"590\"> \n       <tbody> \n        <tr> \n         <td class=\"image\" style=\"width: 590px;\"><a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/files/p/articles/4879007131/Pentax_K-3_Mark_III_D-BG8_rear.jpeg\" target=\"article-4879007131\"><img border=\"0\" data-thumbnail-height=\"0\" data-thumbnail-width=\"590\" height=\"393\" src=\"https://4.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS590x0~articles/4879007131/Pentax_K-3_Mark_III_D-BG8_rear.jpeg\" width=\"590\" data-filename=\"Pentax_K-3_Mark_III_D-BG8_rear.jpeg\" /></a></td> \n        </tr> \n        <tr> \n         <td class=\"caption\" style=\"width: 590px;\">Ricoh has also developed a matching battery grip, the D-BG8.

It may make sense for Ricoh to try to be the last company offering an up-to-date DSLR for those photographers who love the optical viewfinder experience.</p> \n      <p>The K-3 III's price can also look somewhat anachronistic. The Nikon D500 was launched for $2000 and Canon's EOS 7D Mark II for $1800, but a long time has passed since those cameras were released. It's no longer uncommon for full-frame cameras to be released at or below $2000 (including Ricoh's own very impressive Pentax K-1 models).</p> \n      <blockquote class=\"pullQuote\">\n        For some people it'll be better to have an improved DSLR for their K-mount lenses than to have yet another mirrorless option \n      </blockquote> \n      <p>But that still assumes that these other cameras would make appropriate substitutes for the K-3 III. If you've spent a decent chunk of your life and your income building up a set of good Pentax lenses, that may not be the case. For some people it'll be better to have an improved DSLR for their K-mount lenses than to have yet another mirrorless option that would still require a whole new set of lenses or risk a sub-optimal experience with adaptors.</p> \n      <p>Perhaps the only question that matters for the K-3 Mark III is: does it offer enough of an improvement to prompt existing Pentax owners to upgrade? We can't know for certain until we've tested it, but it's clear that Ricoh has done all it can to make it a 'yes', with promised improvements to just about every aspect of the camera. Maybe we've not yet seen the last great DSLR, after all.</p> \n      <p><a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/pentax-k-3-mark-iii-initial-review#index\"><strong>Return to index</strong></a></p>

It boasts a constant F2.8 maximum aperture across its zoom range and is available for both the Sony E-mount, as well as for Leica, Sigma and Panasonic cameras from the L-mount Alliance.</p> \n<p>It's aimed at photographers and videographers who want a bright walkaround zoom and the bokeh possibilities that a wide aperture brings but who don't want the size, weight and cost typical of many F2.8 zooms. Travel and landscape photographers in particular will find its modest size and weight appealing, and it also offers potential as a portrait lens or for video capture.</p> \n<p>Available now, the Sigma 28-70mm F2.8 DG DN Contemporary carries a list price of $899.</p> \n<p class=\"newsLink\" id=\"top\">Jump to:</p> \n<p class=\"newsLink\"><a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/field-review-sigma-28-70mm-f2-8-dg-dn#handling\">Handling </a>| <a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/field-review-sigma-28-70mm-f2-8-dg-dn#autofocus\">Autofocus and focus breathing </a>| <a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/field-review-sigma-28-70mm-f2-8-dg-dn#imagequality\">Image quality</a> | <a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/field-review-sigma-28-70mm-f2-8-dg-dn#conclusion\">Conclusion </a>| <a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/field-review-sigma-28-70mm-f2-8-dg-dn#samplegalleries\">Samples</a></p> \n<p><em>All images edited in Adobe Camera Raw 13 with adjustments limited to white balance, exposure, highlights, shadows, white and black levels.

The maximum magnification of 0.30x (1:3.3) occurs at wide-angle, and if you zoom to the 70mm position, you'll need to move back to 38cm (15in) from your subject, resulting in a weaker but still respectable 0.22x (1:4.6) magnification at telephoto.</p> \n   <table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"images noCrop singleNoBorder center\" data-image-height=\"\" data-image-width=\"590\"> \n    <tbody> \n     <tr> \n      <td class=\"image\" style=\"width: 590px;\"><a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/files/p/articles/9716594092/S1R/9838919764.jpeg\" target=\"article-9716594092\"><img border=\"0\" data-thumbnail-height=\"0\" data-thumbnail-width=\"1180\" height=\"394\" src=\"https://3.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS1180x0~articles/9716594092/S1R/9838919764.jpeg\" width=\"590\" data-filename=\"S1R/9838919764.jpeg\" /></a></td> \n     </tr> \n     <tr> \n      <td class=\"caption\" style=\"width: 590px;\">ISO 100 | 1/1000 sec | F2.8 | 61mm | Panasonic S1R<br><em>Photo by Barney Britton</em></br></td> \n     </tr> \n    </tbody> \n   </table> \n   <p>In terms of video autofocus, the Sigma 28-70mm DG DN has the potential to be a really great option.

And that problem is not limited just to those corners but extends quite a long way towards the center of the frame.</p> \n    <p>While out-of-focus highlights start taking on a football-like shape fairly quickly away as you leave the central region of the frame, the good news is the effect is fairly modest until you reach the very edges and corners. Here, the effect is not so much cats eye as it is truncation of the optical cone due to mechanical obstruction (see the odd shapes in the image below).</p> \n    <table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"images singleNoBorder center\" data-image-height=\"null\" data-image-width=\"590\"> \n     <tbody> \n      <tr> \n       <td class=\"image\" style=\"width: 590px;\"><a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/files/p/articles/9716594092/A7R-III/0023655972.jpeg\" target=\"article-9716594092\"><img border=\"0\" data-aspect-ratio=\"4x3\" data-thumbnail-height=\"0\" data-thumbnail-width=\"590\" height=\"442\" src=\"https://4.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TC4x3S590x0~articles/9716594092/A7R-III/0023655972.jpeg\" width=\"590\" data-filename=\"A7R-III/0023655972.jpeg\" /></a></td> \n      </tr> \n      <tr> \n       <td class=\"caption\" style=\"width: 590px;\">Cat's eye effect is quite noticeable when shooting wide-open and can appear quite a long way towards the center of the image frame.<br>ISO 3200 | 1/80 sec | F2.8 | 70mm | Sony A7R III<br><em>Photo by Chris Niccolls</em></br></br></td> \n      </tr> \n     </tbody> \n    </table> \n    <p>Stopping down helps significantly, though it doesn't entirely solve the problem at the extremes of the image. To be fair, this is an issue with most 24-70mm F2.8 lenses.</p> \n    <p>Overall, though, we really enjoyed the Sigma's thin depth of field and ability to yield soft backgrounds that help draw your viewers' focus to the primary subject, especially for portrait shots. And the falloff from out-of-focus to in-focus and back again is also rather nice.</p> \n    <h3>Flare, ghosting and sunstars</h3> \n    <p>The Sigma 28-70mm F2.8 turns in a decent performance when it comes to ghosting. Even when shooting into the sun or with it in the corner of the frame, there was only a little ghosting noticeable in the far opposite corner. However, flare can be an issue, and you may see a noticeable loss of contrast when shooting with a bright light source in the frame.</p> \n    <table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"images noCrop singleNoBorder center\" data-image-height=\"null\" data-image-width=\"590\"> \n     <tbody> \n      <tr> \n       <td class=\"image\" style=\"width: 590px;\"><a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/files/p/articles/9716594092/A7R-III/6483418067.jpeg\" target=\"article-9716594092\"><img border=\"0\" data-thumbnail-height=\"0\" data-thumbnail-width=\"1180\" height=\"394\" src=\"https://2.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS1180x0~articles/9716594092/A7R-III/6483418067.jpeg\" width=\"590\" data-filename=\"A7R-III/6483418067.jpeg\" /></a></td> \n      </tr> \n      <tr> \n       <td class=\"caption\" style=\"width: 590px;\">ISO 100 | 1/1600 sec | F2.8 | 70mm | Sony A7R III<br><em>Photo by Chris Niccolls</em></br></td> \n      </tr> \n     </tbody> \n    </table> \n    <p>Sunstars are relatively pleasing, with 18 rays thanks to the nine aperture blades.

A hundred-plus years of development has led to several different ways of getting images onto film. In this installment of the <a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/tag/film-beginners-guide\">Absolute beginner’s guide to film photography</a>, we’ll explore the most common types of cameras, and we’ll follow up with some of the more obscure types in a future installment.</p> \n<p><em>All photos: Dan Bracaglia, except where noted</em></p> \n<h2>Single lens reflex cameras (SLRs)</h2> \n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"images noCaptions single center\" data-image-height=\"null\" data-image-width=\"520\"> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td class=\"image\" style=\"width: 520px;\"><a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/files/p/articles/3374379951/beginner-fil-slr-3.jpeg\" target=\"article-3374379951\"><img border=\"0\" data-aspect-ratio=\"4x3\" data-thumbnail-height=\"0\" data-thumbnail-width=\"520\" height=\"390\" src=\"https://4.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TC4x3S520x0~articles/3374379951/beginner-fil-slr-3.jpeg\" width=\"520\" data-filename=\"beginner-fil-slr-3.jpeg\" /></a></td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table> \n<p>You’re probably familiar with DSLRs; take away the D for Digital, and that’s an SLR. When film was king, single lens reflex cameras were the most popular type of 35mm film camera for pros and advanced amateurs. Like the DSLR, the film SLR uses a single lens for both viewing and taking the photo, with a mirror that reflects the scene up to the optical viewfinder. When the shutter button is pressed, the mirror flips upwards and the shutter opens to expose the film. Most SLRs have interchangeable lenses, a key element of their popularity with enthusiasts.</p> \n<p>Early SLRs are fully manual (focusing, exposure, and film loading and rewinding), while later models offered the automation we are familiar with in our digital cameras, including autofocus and automatic and semi-automatic exposure modes. Some entry-level SLRs offered only automatic functionality, allowing them to work like simple point-and-shoot cameras. Though most people associate SLRs with 35mm film, there are medium-format SLRs as well.</p> \n<h3><strong>SLRs today</strong></h3> \n<p>The SLRs is a great choice for those who want maximum creative control. There are plenty available on the used market, and it’s still often possible to get them repaired. Film SLRs are moderately priced compared to digital cameras, and some lesser-known camera brands, as well as newer and more automated SLRs, can be real bargains.</p> \n<h2>Rangefinders</h2> \n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"images noCaptions single center\" data-image-height=\"null\" data-image-width=\"520\"> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td class=\"image\" style=\"width: 520px;\"><a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/files/p/articles/3374379951/First-film-camera10.jpeg\" target=\"article-3374379951\"><img border=\"0\" data-aspect-ratio=\"4x3\" data-thumbnail-height=\"0\" data-thumbnail-width=\"520\" height=\"390\" src=\"https://2.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TC4x3S520x0~articles/3374379951/First-film-camera10.jpeg\" width=\"520\" data-filename=\"First-film-camera10.jpeg\" /></a></td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table> \n<p>Rangefinder cameras use a complex mechanism of mirrors, prisms and cams to allow focus to be previewed in the viewfinder without the need for an SLR-style pentaprism 'hump'. As a consequence, rangefinder cameras are smaller and lighter than SLRs, and generally quieter and smoother in their operation because they lack a large moving mirror and its associated mechanism. Some rangefinder cameras offer interchangeable lenses, and the lack of a mirror box means that the rear elements of lenses can sit much closer to the film plane, making the camera + lens package more compact.</p> \n<p>Amateur-level 35mm rangefinders were largely replaced by compact point-and-shoot cameras in the 1980s (see below), though many high-end models remained in production for a long time. In fact, Leica only recently discontinued the semi-automatic M7, and still makes <a href=\"https://leicacamerausa.com/photography/leica-m/m-cameras/analog/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">two manual M-series film cameras</a>.</p> \n<h3><strong>Rangefinders today</strong></h3> \n<p>The rangefinder is a good choice for film photographers who want a camera that is compact and quiet, but don’t want to give up the image quality provided by an SLR. However, high-end rangefinder cameras are expensive, and can be costly to repair and service.</p> \n<h2>Compact point-and-shoot</h2> \n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"images noCaptions single center\" data-image-height=\"null\" data-image-width=\"520\"> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td class=\"image\" style=\"width: 520px;\"><a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/files/p/articles/3374379951/Olympus-mju-ii03.jpeg\" target=\"article-3374379951\"><img border=\"0\" data-aspect-ratio=\"4x3\" data-thumbnail-height=\"0\" data-thumbnail-width=\"520\" height=\"390\" src=\"https://2.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TC4x3S520x0~articles/3374379951/Olympus-mju-ii03.jpeg\" width=\"520\" data-filename=\"Olympus-mju-ii03.jpeg\" /></a></td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table> \n<p>Compact point-and-shoot film cameras, often abbreviated P&amp;S, emerged in the early 1980s and became immensely popular, serving much the same role as smartphone cameras do today. P&amp;S cameras were simple to operate, hence their name, and featured either automatic exposure and focus or a 'focus-free' design with a small aperture and a single shutter speed that relied on the latitude of color print film to provide usable photographs. Earlier models had fixed lenses while later models incorporated zoom lenses. The compact point-and-shoot camera was a huge advance for casual snap-shooters, allowing them to get results comparable in quality to a 35mm SLR with no knowledge of photography.</p> \n<h3>Compact point-and-shoot cameras today</h3> \n<p>P&amp;S cameras are easy to find and, aside from a few models that have achieved cult status (see above photo), and cheap to buy – that is if you don’t already have a relative willing to give you the one that’s been sitting in the closet for the last twenty years. Though they limit creative control somewhat, they’re great for budding film photographers who just want to start snapping away.</p> \n<h2>Disposable cameras</h2> \n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"images noCaptions single center\" data-image-height=\"null\" data-image-width=\"520\"> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td class=\"image\" style=\"width: 520px;\"><a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/files/p/articles/3374379951/single-use.jpeg\" target=\"article-3374379951\"><img border=\"0\" data-aspect-ratio=\"4x3\" data-thumbnail-height=\"0\" data-thumbnail-width=\"520\" height=\"390\" src=\"https://2.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TC4x3S520x0~articles/3374379951/single-use.jpeg\" width=\"520\" data-filename=\"single-use.jpeg\" /></a></td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table> \n<p>Disposable or single-use cameras became popular in the mid-1980s. They are simple plastic affairs, usually with fixed-focus lenses, that contain a single roll of film. Once all the pictures are taken, the entire camera is sent for processing, where the film is developed and the camera itself disposed or reloaded for re-use. Disposable cameras were popular alternatives for travel (no need to worry about your expensive camera being stolen) and for guests at parties. Some vehicle fleet operators used to put a point-and-shoot camera in the glovebox to record the scene in the event of an accident.</p> \n<h3>Disposable cameras today</h3> \n<p>Disposable cameras are still in production. They’re a good way to try film on the barest possible budget, though they offer next to no creative control and image quality will not be as good as a halfway-decent point-and-shoot. Some film photographers like the 'lo-fi' look of their plastic lenses (and they're great for weddings and kids' birthday parties).</p> \n<p><em>Photo: Lomography</em></p> \n<h2>Bridge cameras</h2> \n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"images noCaptions single center\" data-image-height=\"null\" data-image-width=\"520\"> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td class=\"image\" style=\"width: 520px;\"><a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/files/p/articles/3374379951/Ricoh-Mirai.jpeg\" target=\"article-3374379951\"><img border=\"0\" data-aspect-ratio=\"4x3\" data-thumbnail-height=\"0\" data-thumbnail-width=\"520\" height=\"390\" src=\"https://2.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TC4x3S520x0~articles/3374379951/Ricoh-Mirai.jpeg\" width=\"520\" data-filename=\"Ricoh-Mirai.jpeg\" /></a></td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table> \n<p>Bridge cameras still exist in the digital age, and their film forbears fulfilled much the same mission, bridging the gap between simple compact point-and-shoot cameras and interchangeable-lens SLRs. The film-era bridge camera appeared around 1988, and most were autofocus SLRs with a non-removable zoom lens. Many bridge cameras combined features that appealed to snap-shooters, like built-in flashes and scene modes, with more advanced creative controls.</p> \n<h3>Bridge cameras today</h3> \n<p>Bridge cameras represent a good bargain buy for modern-day film photographers who want more creative control than a P&amp;S would give them but don’t need to interchange lenses. The downside is that compared to most compacts, they're massive. If you buy a bridge camera, you’ll want one that uses 35mm film, as APS film is no longer being made.</p> \n<p><em>Photo: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/maderik/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">E Magnuson </a></em></p> \n<h2>Toy cameras</h2> \n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"images noCaptions single center\" data-image-height=\"\" data-image-width=\"520\"> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td class=\"image\" style=\"width: 520px;\"><a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/files/p/articles/3374379951/Holga.jpeg\" target=\"article-3374379951\"><img border=\"0\" data-thumbnail-height=\"0\" data-thumbnail-width=\"520\" height=\"347\" src=\"https://1.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS520x0~articles/3374379951/Holga.jpeg\" width=\"520\" data-filename=\"Holga.jpeg\" /></a></td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table> \n<p>Most toy cameras aren’t actually <em>toys</em>, but rather inexpensive consumer-grade cameras that typically originated in Eastern and Soviet-bloc markets. These cameras started to make their way to Western countries in the 1990s and quickly became popular for their artistic effects: Their cheap plastic lenses and inconsistent construction quality (and resulting light leaks) introduced a random element to photography that expensive, high-end cameras could not replicate. Most took either 35mm or 120-size medium-format film. Popular toy cameras include the Holta, Diana, and the Lomo LC-A, which inspired the Lomography corporation.</p> \n<h3>Toy cameras today</h3> \n<p>For today’s film photographers, toy cameras have much the same appeal as they did in the 1990s, and they’re good fun if you want a level of unpredictability in your photos. While many take 120-size film, don’t think of them as entry-level medium-format cameras, as they cannot reliably produce the high-quality images for which medium format is best known.</p> \n<p><em>Photo: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/garryknight/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Garry Knight</a></em></p> \n<h2>Instant Cameras</h2> \n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"images noCaptions single center\" data-image-height=\"null\" data-image-width=\"520\"> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td class=\"image\" style=\"width: 520px;\"><a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/files/p/articles/3374379951/Fujifilm-Instax-SQ1-01.jpeg\" target=\"article-3374379951\"><img border=\"0\" data-aspect-ratio=\"4x3\" data-thumbnail-height=\"0\" data-thumbnail-width=\"520\" height=\"390\" src=\"https://2.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TC4x3S520x0~articles/3374379951/Fujifilm-Instax-SQ1-01.jpeg\" width=\"520\" data-filename=\"Fujifilm-Instax-SQ1-01.jpeg\" /></a></td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table> \n<p>Instant photography is almost a separate branch of film photography, and it’s one that has a lot of devotees. Instant cameras use a special type of film that contains development chemicals in a pouch adjacent to the image area. After the picture is taken, rollers in the camera distribute the developer as the photo is ejected from the camera, and the picture appears in a few seconds. Instant photography was a fixture in the mid-to-late 20th century but was largely displaced by the advent of consumer-level point-and-shoot digital cameras. Instant photography was pioneered by the Polaroid Corporation, which went bankrupt in 2001 but has since been resurrected as a brand that you'll see licensed for use on various photo-related products. Polaroid film has its own unique artistic appeal, but the per-shot costs can be very high.</p> \n<h3>Instant cameras today</h3> \n<p>Instant photography is alive and well – <a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/buying-guide-best-instant-camera\">read our Instax camera buying guide</a>. The new Polaroid Corporation (formerly The Impossible Project) sells instant cameras and film for both new and classic Polaroid cameras, while Fujifilm sells its own instant cameras and film under the Instax name. Pack film, in which the picture must be peeled away from a backing containing the chemicals, is not currently in production, nor is instant film for Kodak’s Colorburst instant cameras, which were discontinued following a lawsuit by Polaroid.</p> \n<p><em>Photo: Jeanette Moses</em></p> \n<h2>About this guide</h2> \n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"images noCaptions noCrop single center\" data-image-height=\"null\" data-image-width=\"520\"> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td class=\"image\" style=\"width: 520px;\"><a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/files/p/articles/3374379951/First-film-camera5.jpeg\" target=\"article-3374379951\"><img border=\"0\" data-thumbnail-height=\"0\" data-thumbnail-width=\"520\" height=\"347\" src=\"https://2.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS520x0~articles/3374379951/First-film-camera5.jpeg\" width=\"520\" data-filename=\"First-film-camera5.jpeg\" /></a></td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table> \n<p><em>Our '<a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/tag/film-beginners-guide\">Absolute beginner’s guide to film photography</a>' is an educational series of articles focused on demystifying the ins and outs of analog photography.

The remaining 810,000 mirrorless cameras were split amongst other manufacturers, including Fujifilm, Leica, Panasonic, Olympus (now OM Digital Solutions), Sigma and others, but no specific production numbers were given for any other manufacturers. As for DSLRs, it shouldn’t come as a surprise that Canon and Nikon led the pack with 1.71 million and 650,000 units produced, respectively.</p> \n<p>The number of cameras produced by a company doesn’t always equal the number of cameras sold. However, if you compare Techno System Research’s numbers with the sales numbers both Canon and Nikon have shared in their respective financial reports, it appears as though both Canon and Nikon sold pretty much every unit they produced in 2020.<sup>1</sup></p> \n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"images noCrop singleNoBorder center\" data-image-height=\"null\" data-image-width=\"590\"> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td class=\"image\" style=\"width: 590px;\"><img border=\"0\" data-thumbnail-height=\"0\" data-thumbnail-width=\"590\" height=\"308\" src=\"https://2.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS590x0~articles/1971826389/87BFA051-7509-47EB-88FB-B07DFC01647A.jpeg\" width=\"590\" data-filename=\"87BFA051-7509-47EB-88FB-B07DFC01647A.jpeg\" /></td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td class=\"caption\" style=\"width: 590px;\">Canon’s EOS R5 and EOS R6 cameras, both of which were released in the second half of 2020.</td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table> \n<p>Specifically, Canon reported 2.76 million units sold throughout 2020 (1.05M mirrorless cameras + 1.71M DSLR cameras = 2.76M total), while Nikon reported 900,000 interchangeable lenses sold in 2020 (250,000 mirrorless cameras + 650,000 DSLR cameras = 900,000 total). This not only lends credence to Techno System Research’s numbers, but also reveals a few interesting stats we haven’t been able to take away from Canon and Nikon’s financial reports, including the mirrorless to DSLR camera makeup of Canon and Nikon’s production capacity.</p> \n<p>Of the 2.76 million interchangeable lens cameras Canon produced in 2020, 38% of them were mirrorless cameras. For Nikon, that number was just 28%. Considering the supply chain issues and overall chaotic nature of 2020, we’ll refrain from drawing conclusions from that difference, but it’s something to keep an eye on going forward, especially as both companies show an increased effort to focus on their respective mid-and-high-end mirrorless camera models.</p> \n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"images noCrop singleNoBorder center\" data-image-height=\"null\" data-image-width=\"590\"> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td class=\"image\" style=\"width: 590px;\"><a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/files/p/articles/1971826389/630BE2B3-0600-4321-99EA-5BB8E3FC7994.jpeg\" target=\"article-74547dff93594c1195b522533c1e726d\"><img border=\"0\" data-thumbnail-height=\"0\" data-thumbnail-width=\"590\" height=\"393\" src=\"https://4.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS590x0~articles/1971826389/630BE2B3-0600-4321-99EA-5BB8E3FC7994.jpeg\" width=\"590\" data-filename=\"630BE2B3-0600-4321-99EA-5BB8E3FC7994.jpeg\" /></a></td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td class=\"caption\" style=\"width: 590px;\">Nikon’s Z6 II and Z7 II cameras, released in October 2020.</td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table> \n<p>As a whole, Sony has managed to keep its lead in the mirrorless camera world (at least as far as units produced is concerned). However, Sony’s lead is thin and as Canon shifts more of its production capacity and development efforts to mirrorless, it’ll be interesting to see if Canon surpasses Sony in 2021.</p> \n<p>Something else to keep an eye on as people transition from DSLR cameras to mirrorless cameras is the production volume of each camera type. That is, will a majority of DSLR camera buyers switch to mirrorless or will the majority of the DSLR camera market opt to drop bulky cameras entirely as smartphone camera technology continues to improve? Assuming Techno System Research releases a similar report next year, we should have a good idea.</p> \n<hr> \n <p><sup>1</sup> Sony‘s financial reports don’t break down camera sales numbers, so we can't definitely state whether or not Sony sold all 1.15 million mirrorless cameras it produced in 2020. ↩</p> \n <hr> \n  <p><em><strong>Correction: (Sunday, March 28, 2021 at 4:18 PM):</strong> The headline of this article originally stated Nikon was third, behind Sony and Canon in mirrorless production.
