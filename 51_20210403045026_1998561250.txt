Fortunately, no lives were lost. Unfortunately, the island offered not a drop of fresh water.</p>\n<p>Today, that island is among the <a href=\"https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/countries-by-density\">most densely populated countries</a> on Earth, and it is still without a permanent body of fresh water. Oddly enough, visitors to Bermuda can see the solution to the problem of potability before the plane even touches down.</p>\n<p>Bermudians are some of the most water-conscious people in the Western world, and this consciousness is built into their homes. The blindingly white, limestone Bermuda Roof—an architectural rain-catch concept with roots dating back to the 17th century—is singularly responsible for making human life possible in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. The roof of each home is mandated, by law, to catch and redirect rain into underground cisterns that serve as islanders’ primary source of freshwater. While initially conceived as a means of survival, the elegant roofs have become an aesthetic landmark. “Architecturally, Bermuda really hasn’t changed,” says Guilden Gilbert, a born-and-raised Bermudian. “It’s unlikely that you’d see any modern design in island architecture, which I think is actually a good thing.”</p>\n<figure class=\"article-image-full-width contains-caption \"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/81552/image.jpg\" alt=\"article-image\" width=\"auto\" data-kind=\"article-image\" /></figure>\n<p>Gilbert and his wife left Bermuda 24 years ago, but he took the roof with him. Today he runs a construction company that exports the concept <a href=\"http://www.thebermudaroof.com/\">throughout the Caribbean</a>. “Bermuda’s roofs last for generations,” he says. “The house I grew up in was 95 years old, still had the original roof. The house next door was 200 years old, still had the original roof.” In fact, the Carter House (named after one of the shipwrecked sailors from 1609) was built in the 1680s—original roof.</p>\n<p>It’s an ingenious concept, even if the land itself does most of the work. Bermuda is a limestone island, so for most of the houses, the stone that is unearthed to make room for the foundation and mandatory water tank becomes the slabs that form the actual roof. The sloping slabs then catch, slow, and redirect rain through several pipes that meet in the underground tank. “When it’s heavy rain, you actually hear it in the various downpipes in the walls,” says Geoffrey Smith, an environmental engineer with the Government of Bermuda. “It’s actually a nice sound.” He says regulations demand that 80 percent of each roof be designated for rain catch, and that for every 10 square feet of roof, the tank below must hold 100 gallons of water.</p>\n<p>The roofs have side-benefits, too. According to Gilbert, the limestone is naturally cooling, relieving most families of the need for central air conditioning. So long as there are no overhangs or gaps between the coated slabs, the inch-thick roofs are also virtually hurricane-proof. “In rare cases, the whole stone roof will have been lifted up and shifted a foot or two,” says University of Rochester historian Michael Jarvis. “But it’s still solid.”</p>\n<p>Between the roofs, pipes, and tanks, the uniquely Bermudian relationship to water trickles into day-to-day life. Hydrogeologist Shaun Lavis grew up in the United Kingdom, but has acclimated to the centrality of rainfall in island living. “I’ve got a little part of my brain that’s always aware of the tank level,” he says. “Pretty healthy at the moment, we’ve had good weather.” He says islanders refer to prolonged bouts of precipitation as “tank-rain” or a “tank-filler.” The water pressure isn’t quite the same as back home, he says, and baths are more of a rarity. “Probably a quarterly event, if there’s been a good rain. But it’s somewhat frowned upon.”</p>\n<figure class=\"article-image-full-width contains-caption \"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/81553/image.jpg\" alt=\"article-image\" width=\"auto\" data-kind=\"article-image\" /></figure>\n<p>Indeed, rain is exalted, and water waste is condemned. “Bermudian kids are always taught about conservation and the Bermuda Roofs from a young age,” says Gilbert. From taking short showers, to turning off the water while brushing your teeth—and, in rough times—flushing toilets as little as possible, the interplay between water and survival is ingrained from a young age. “We were raised to be cognizant of how much water was in the tank,” he says. “We had to make it last.” Of course, droughts still happen. While roof catch meets the needs of most Bermudians most years, innovations have been made to accommodate an expanding population. In the 20th century, the growth of the tourism industry (today a distant second to financial services) meant the arrival of hoards of water-gluttonous mainlanders, mostly Americans. Around then, according to Jarvis, the island developed its first desalination plants, which use reverse osmosis to make fresh water. Other backup sources were identified throughout the century, including groundwater lenses (fresh water that floats on top of denser saltwater), as well as water mains and trucks to bring water to empty-tanked families. The island now fills all its water needs consistently, but, according to Smith, rain catch from Bermuda Roofs is still far and away the largest source.</p>\n<p>Bermudians appreciate the backups, but cling to tradition anyway. As Jarvis says, “Bermudian families strive for self-sufficiency. To need government water is almost like surrendering, like you lost the fight.”</p>\n      ","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 31 Mar 2021 21:48:00 +0000","feedId":51,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"62fce04f67023e45b13abdabb8d46bf7","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Luke Fater","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/81552/image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn4@2020_6/2021/04/03/04-49-41-687_862d559ae1c9524f.webp","https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/81553/image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn11@2020_6/2021/04/03/04-49-43-517_57aaf366a07d760d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617425381049},{"createdTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:41","updatedTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:41","title":"Why Researchers Dressed as Leopards to Scare Some Monkeys","link":"https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/leopard-monkey-congo-research","description":"\n        <p>It’s a tricky thing trying to pretend you’re a predator deep in the rainforest in northern <a href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/things-to-do/republic-of-the-congo\">Republic of the Congo</a>. \"It’s very humid, and sweat bees are all over you,\" according to primatologist and conservation scientist Claudia Stephan. “Most of the time you see ahead for just a couple of meters due to dense vegetation,” she adds, via email from a remote site in the region’s Nouabelé-Ndoki National Park.</p>\n<p>The difficult work paid off, however. Using an ingenious, if surpassing simple, disguise, the team led by Stephan and her Wildlife Conservation Society colleague Frederic Gnepa Mehon, also a primatologist and conservation scientist, uncovered intriguing subtleties in the way that male and female monkeys communicate when danger is near. The findings, <a href=\"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.202135\">published recently</a> in <em>Royal Society Open Science</em>, show that alarm calls are not just about alerting the group to a threat. The female monkeys in the study tried to get the males to take certain actions and the males, in response, basically said “I got this.”</p>\n<p>“We were completely struck by the extent to which female and male communication strategies differ in the very same context,” says Stephan. “This raises loads of questions about the function that alarm calls generally serve.”</p>\n<p>But staging an experiment like this in the field isn’t easy. Researchers such as Stephan and Mehon usually have limited options for studying how animals in the wild react to a threat. Waiting around, hoping to witness such an encounter naturally is inefficient. Some researchers play recordings of predator calls, which requires a certain credulity on the part of the intended subjects, given that few predators vocalize when actually hunting, for obvious reasons. Setting up a static model of a predator requires guessing the path that your quarry will take, and, even then, the unblinking stare or stiff posture of a fake leopard might not impress savvy animals such as the putty-nosed monkeys (<em>Cercopithecus nictitans</em>) of western Africa.</p>\n<figure class=\"article-image-full-width contains-caption \"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/81566/image.jpg\" alt=\"article-image\" width=\"auto\" data-kind=\"article-image\" /></figure>\n<p>So, to learn more about the putty-nosed monkey’s alarm calls, the researchers had to get creative. Stephan says the team opted for the most naturalistic disguise they could field-design: A team member covered himself in store-bought leopard-print fabric. While others observed, the low-tech leopard surrogate crept through the dense vegetation, inching toward a group of the monkeys. That’s when things got interesting.</p>\n<p>In multiple trials over six months, involving 19 different groups of putty-nosed monkeys, the female adults responded to the faux leopard with an all-purpose alarm call known as a “chirp,” intended to attract the attention of the male of the group. “Female putty-nosed monkeys use their males as ‘hired guns’ for predation defense,” Stephan says. “They do so by emitting alarm calls that do not contain any information about ongoing events, requiring males to come and to see what’s going on.”</p>\n<p>The team also recorded examples of the two previously documented alarm calls made by male putty-nosed monkeys: the “hack,” for an airborne threat such as an eagle, and the “pyow,” for terrestrial threats, including the static leopard models used in those earlier field experiments. But Stephan and Mehon’s team—the first to present a somewhat more realistic, moving model—consistently recorded a third alarm call, never before observed: the “kek.”</p>\n<figure class=\"article-image-full-width contains-caption \"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/81559/image.jpg\" alt=\"article-image\" width=\"auto\" data-kind=\"article-image\" /></figure>\n<p>The males made the kek sound only after identifying the moving leopard and approaching it to distract the predator. “Once their male approached, females stop alarm calling, take their offspring and hide in the dense vegetation,” Mehon says. “They behave as if they have achieved their goal: They successfully manipulated the male to come and to defend them.”</p>\n<p>While taking on a predator alone may not seem like the best survival strategy for the male, putty-nosed monkeys live in groups of one adult male, several females and their offspring, so the male will have already passed along his genes. At that point, survival of the group, rather than the lone male, is the top evolutionary priority.</p>\n<p>The findings also call into question how and why sex-based alarm calls evolved. “Our results suggest for the first time that there is a [difference] in alarm function based on the sex of the signaler,” says Stephan.</p>\n<p>“This system is, to my knowledge, very unique,” says Melissa Berthet, who studies animal communication at the Jean Nicod Institute in Paris and was not involved in the new research. “In most species, alarm calls are the same for all individuals: They are emitted to inform that a threat is nearby.” Berthet has recorded and analyzed the alarm calls of titi monkeys in Brazil, which vary to indicate the location and type of predator—but not by the sex of the caller. She says the new paper is important for the field because “when investigating the meaning and function of alarm calls, we mostly focus on the external events, such as whether the calls are associated with a level of urgency, which apparently makes us miss a big part of the story.”</p>\n<figure class=\"article-image-full-width contains-caption \"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/81565/image.jpg\" alt=\"article-image\" width=\"auto\" data-kind=\"article-image\" /></figure>\n<p>Instead, Berthet says, understanding how alarm calls influence behavior of individuals within a group is crucial. Berthet also appreciates the team’s creative use of a leopard stand-in, which avoided some of the difficulties she and other researchers have encountered. She’s found that static models are often quickly recognized by the monkeys as fakes, and that recorded predator sounds yield inconclusive results. “I’m not sure that titi monkeys recognized the calls,” Berthet says.</p>\n<p>For Stephan and Mehon’s team, the biggest challenge was not being a leopard, but rather being a leopard in the jungle. The dense rainforest offered a “cacophony of sounds.” The buzz of cicadas, in particular, so dominated many of the team’s recordings that they were unusable. Bigger animals posed bigger problems. Guides from a local Ba’aka community frequently alerted them to forest elephants or gorillas moving through the area, and chimpanzees repeatedly approached the researchers, getting within 50 feet, “curiously observing what the bipedal ape was possibly doing in their territory,” Stephan says.</p>\n<p>And then there was the moment when a potential threat was serendipity. Stephan recalls that the team briefly encountered a real leopard before it ran off. “It elicited exactly the same kek calls from the putty-nosed male as those we recorded with our [leopard stand-in],” she says. “An unexpected and very reassuring confirmation of our model choice.”</p>\n      ","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 01 Apr 2021 21:04:00 +0000","feedId":51,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"6ee39d4d031512ecc1515e4d3e3008c1","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Gemma Tarlach","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/81566/image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn70@2020_1/2021/04/03/04-49-42-053_abdeea13261f77a4.webp","https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/81559/image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn22@2020_6/2021/04/03/04-49-42-111_5d3fa388eee2dfa5.webp","https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/81565/image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn74@2020_1/2021/04/03/04-49-42-607_08c4f41d71f14250.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617425381030},{"createdTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:41","updatedTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:41","title":"Mercur Cemetery in West Mercur, Utah","link":"https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mercur-cemetery","description":"\n        <p><img alt=\"A lonely grave.\" data-width=\"720\" data-height=\"960\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/media/W1siZiIsInVwbG9hZHMvcGxhY2VfaW1hZ2VzLzM5OTJiN2ZlLTljZjEtNDc0Ni1iYjI3LTVlZDFlZWVlY2Y5YzdlNDM2MjViNzgzNDA0YjAyYl83MjAwRjJDQi0yMEI1LTQwNDgtOTcwRS1FMUJCRTk0QjNDRTYuanBlZyJdLFsicCIsImNvbnZlcnQiLCItYXV0by1vcmllbnQgIl0sWyJwIiwidGh1bWIiLCI3MjB4NDgwKzArMzQ5Il0sWyJwIiwiY29udmVydCIsIi1xdWFsaXR5IDgxIC1hdXRvLW9yaWVudCJdLFsicCIsInRodW1iIiwiMzAweDIwMCMiXV0/7200F2CB-20B5-4048-970E-E1BBE94B3CE6.jpeg\" /></p> <p>Located 25 minutes west of Tooele, <a class=\"destination-link place-destination-link\" title=\"Things to do in Utah\" href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/things-to-do/utah\" data-destination-link-kind=\"place\" data-geo-id=\"4428\" data-title=\"Utah\" data-slug=\"utah\">Utah</a>, is the site of a former booming mining town that was full of life and promise.</p>\n<p>A distant memory of the Old West, Mercur became one of Utah’s first mining districts in 1893. At one point, the town was home to well over 5,000 people.

The statue in the Reykjanes peninsula was created by the artist Todd McGrain. It is one of several works that he has done as part of his Lost Bird Project. The series includes sculptures of several extinct avian species, placed in the last location they were known to live.</p>\n<p>The statue stands about five feet tall and there is an information board about both the artist and the bird. The great auk (<em>Pinguinus impennis</em>) was a flightless bird that became extinct in the mid-19th century. It was the first bird to be called penguin, though these birds were not related to the penguins of the southern hemisphere.</p>\n<p>The great auk bred on isolated rocky islands with easy access to the ocean and a good food supply. This situation is rare and there were only a few breeding sites for the auks. The site of the sculpture is significant. The last two confirmed specimens were killed on Eldey, which can be seen about 10 miles offshore from the cliffs, on July 3, 1844. This also destroyed the last known breeding attempt. There have been later reports of dispersed individuals being seen or caught  but these are unconfirmed. There is a similar <a href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/great-auk-sculpture\">sculpture in Canada</a>, also created by McGrain.</p>\n      ","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 31 Mar 2021 17:00:00 +0000","feedId":51,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"a385c16c2413779e6c6a2af4a1ab5e09","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/media/W1siZiIsInVwbG9hZHMvcGxhY2VfaW1hZ2VzLzVkZTJhMTNmLWY4ZmItNDExZi04NTQxLTk4ZDYzZTE5ZTdlOTYyNTgyYTQ2YmUwMzU5MTczNF8xODMwNzI0Njg0OF9lZDc5NTlkNzUyX2IuanBlZyJdLFsicCIsImNvbnZlcnQiLCItYXV0by1vcmllbnQgIl0sWyJwIiwidGh1bWIiLCI2Nzl4NDUyKzErMTk3Il0sWyJwIiwiY29udmVydCIsIi1xdWFsaXR5IDgxIC1hdXRvLW9yaWVudCJdLFsicCIsInRodW1iIiwiMzAweDIwMCMiXV0/18307246848_ed7959d752_b.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn11@2020_4/2021/04/03/04-49-41-972_39431d4571829821.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617425381022},{"createdTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:41","updatedTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:41","title":"The Colonial Tavern Dishing Up 18th-Century Vittles","link":"https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/colonial-williamsburg-restaurant","description":"\n        <p>In colonial America, a family might enjoy a Cheshire pork pie filled with pork tenderloin, apples, and spices. Another might enjoy a corncake, thanks to the maize long cultivated by Indigenous people. A wealthy family might indulge in a bird—but not just any bird, you see. A bird that had been plucked, cooked, and reassembled to sit in the center of the table.</p>\n<p>Dishes like these once appeared on the menu at King’s Arms Tavern, a “public house” that opened in 1772 in Williamsburg, which was then the capital of Virginia. The restaurant is still serving food, albeit as a careful reproduction in Colonial Williamsburg, the world’s largest outdoor living-history museum, where actors in period costumes share stories about colonial dining history. King’s Arms Tavern closed their doors for a time due to the pandemic, but as of today, a revamped menu will greet diners, one that looks a lot more like the fare of 1772.</p>\n<p>“As long as I've worked in historic foodways, we've been trying to get historic-based foods into the tavern,” says Frank Clark, an expert on historic foodways at the <a href=\"https://www.colonialwilliamsburg.org/\">Colonial Williamsburg Foundation</a>. Though the tavern served food inspired by the 18th century before its closure, which were brought out by costumed staff on period-appropriate dishes, those “inspirations” often turned into burgers, prime rib, and club sandwiches. For the past two years, however, Clark has been working with King’s Arms Tavern lead chef, Kevin Nickerson, to craft a more literal interpretation of 18th-century colonial fare.</p>\n<figure class=\"article-image-full-width contains-caption \"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/81596/image.jpg\" alt=\"article-image\" width=\"auto\" data-kind=\"article-image\" /></figure>\n<p>Understanding how Americans cooked has intrigued Clark throughout his career. For more than 30 years, he has worked to trace and recover knowledge that allows visitors and historians to better understand how food shaped life in the 18th century.</p>\n<p>“We have a fabulous resource in the form of printed cookbooks that were published and written in this period,” he says. They represent “an immense catalogue of information that really exceeds most any other historic trade that we have here in Williamsburg.”</p>\n<p>One cooking principle that stands out, which Clark wanted to communicate through the new menu, is how seasonality and the lack of refrigeration dictated what appeared on dinner plates in Colonial Williamsburg. That’s how carrot puffs, which are similar to hush puppies and made by mashing the carrots, made the new menu—cooks made the dish when carrots were nearing expiration. Similarly, hunters game pye is a hearty reminder of a time when meat pies weren’t just a culinary delight. Made with valuable scraps of venison, duck, and rabbit, this colonial classic was a safety measure, since baking the pie would kill any bacteria that had developed in the meat since it was first roasted.</p>\n<p>“We tried to do things that would give [diners] an understanding of, okay, this is what the cooks of the 18th century had to work with,” says Clark. His goal was “to give a chef's understanding of that particular time.”</p>\n<figure class=\"article-image-full-width contains-caption \"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/81564/image.jpg\" alt=\"article-image\" width=\"auto\" data-kind=\"article-image\" /></figure>\n<p>Another strain of research that influenced the menu is the increased attention among scholars to Black and Native American contributions, such as those of Thomas Jefferson’s enslaved cooks, <a href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/james-hemings-jefferson-chef\">James and Peter Hemings</a>, who became lauded chefs and brewers. Although Africans and Indigenous people often exchanged their knowledge orally, cookbooks from colonial cooks recorded key recipes, instructions, and context that have guided food historians.</p>\n<p>“There would be no Virginia food if it wasn't for African Americans who came here,” says Clark. “They didn't come willingly, but even so they contributed to the flavors and the creation of the cuisine that became Virginia cooking in the 19th century. And that's true everywhere in America.”</p>\n<p>One of the Tavern’s new dishes, King’s Arms peanut soupe, tracks this history. A variation of a recipe developed in the early 1900s by George Washington Carver, the celebrated African-American scientist and peanut enthusiast, it’s a nutty ode to enslaved people who came to the Americas with extensive knowledge of how to grow and cook with peanuts.</p>\n<p>“I think it's interesting to tell the story of food not just in our little time capsule, but overall,” says Nickerson, “to tell the entire story of food.”</p>\n<figure class=\"article-image-full-width contains-caption \"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/81595/image.jpg\" alt=\"article-image\" width=\"auto\" data-kind=\"article-image\" /></figure>\n<p>Clark and Nickerson both spent hours with old cookbooks and in archives to figure out how to effectively share these lessons with guests, but they couldn’t simply pick 18th-century recipes and plop them onto a 21st-century menu. Clark stumbled across a recipe for roasted peacock, for example, a fairly common dish in the 1700s. It instructed cooks to remove the skin and feathers, then place the skin and feathers back on the cooked bird.</p>\n<p>“You know, that's something that I probably don't have the skill set for,” says Clark laughing.</p>\n<p>Like many chefs, Nickerson is inspired by the lessons left behind by 18th-century cookbooks and recipe cards, but his culinary creativity plays a key role in adapting the recipes for today’s diners. For the carrot puffs recipe, he departed from the 18th-century recipe by combining it with a spring-pea hummus and a pistachio-and-carrot pesto, delighting guests who sampled menu items ahead of the opening.</p>\n<p>Clark was one of them. “It was fabulous,” he says. “I never would have thought of that combination, but it really worked quite well.” Despite his devotion to the past, he says he was impressed with Nickerson’s ability to make the old taste like something new.</p>\n<figure class=\"article-image-full-width contains-caption \"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/81571/image.jpg\" alt=\"article-image\" width=\"auto\" data-kind=\"article-image\" /></figure>\n<p>As King’s Arms Tavern prepares to welcome guests, Nickerson and Clark are excited to be part of a culinary project that’s historical, educational, and, perhaps most important during these daunting times: fun.</p>\n<p>“I just hope they have a good time,” Clark says of the forthcoming guests. “It’s just a great and delicious way to step back and connect with the past.”</p>\n<p>Can visitors manage to get full bellies and digest full history lessons? Only time will tell.</p>\n      ","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 01 Apr 2021 22:36:00 +0000","feedId":51,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"481d07c3ff234b7091ec0b5018daceaa","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Kayla Stewart","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/81596/image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn38@2020_6/2021/04/03/04-49-41-845_8be1cd90c2e1b8d5.webp","https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/81564/image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn57@2020_1/2021/04/03/04-49-41-748_c694fafaa2bea019.webp","https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/81595/image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn9@2020_3/2021/04/03/04-49-42-096_384604be729e8434.webp","https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/81571/image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn53@2020_3/2021/04/03/04-49-42-052_053eb7192dfa396a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617425381028},{"createdTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:41","updatedTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:41","title":"Carolina Raptor Center in Huntersville, North Carolina","link":"https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/carolina-raptor-center","description":"\n        <p><img alt=\"Queen Beatrice, the Eurasian Eagle Owl, with Trainer Colleen Roddick. \" data-width=\"3406\" data-height=\"1916\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/media/W1siZiIsInVwbG9hZHMvcGxhY2VfaW1hZ2VzLzBiYzdlNGMzYmNkYTdhNzBmNl9CZWFfQ29sbGVlbl9XaWxsaWFtX0tydW1wZWxtYW5fMl9KRUVESVQgMi5qcGciXSxbInAiLCJjb252ZXJ0IiwiIl0sWyJwIiwiY29udmVydCIsIi1xdWFsaXR5IDgxIC1hdXRvLW9yaWVudCJdLFsicCIsInRodW1iIiwiMzAweDIwMCMiXV0/Bea_Colleen_William_Krumpelman_2_JEEDIT%202.jpg\" /></p> <p>In 1975, an injured broad-winged hawk found its way to Dr. Richard Brown, an ornithologist at the University of <a class=\"destination-link place-destination-link\" title=\"Things to do in North Carolina\" href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/things-to-do/north-carolina\" data-destination-link-kind=\"place\" data-geo-id=\"4408\" data-title=\"North Carolina\" data-slug=\"north-carolina\">North Carolina</a> at <a class=\"destination-link place-destination-link\" title=\"Things to do in Charlotte, North Carolina\" href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/things-to-do/charlotte-north-carolina\" data-destination-link-kind=\"place\" data-geo-id=\"2475\" data-title=\"Charlotte, North Carolina\" data-slug=\"charlotte-north-carolina\">Charlotte</a>. Along with several biology students, Brown helped the bird back to health and released it into the wild—it would be the first of many rehabilitations.</p>\n<p>Over the years that followed, more and more birds were brought into the makeshift clinic in the basement of the university’s biology building. In 1980, Brown and Deb Sue Griffin, one of his students, decided to make things more official. Together they founded Carolina Raptor Center, which has admitted some 20,000 birds over the last four decades.</p>\n<p>In 1984, the center moved into a new home inside Latta Nature Preserve, which spans more than 1,400 acres. The preserve offers opportunities for hiking, horseback riding, and paddling in the waters of Gar Creek and Mountain Island Lake.</p>\n<p>Around 60 percent of the raptors admitted are rehabilitated and then released back into the wild. The birds that cannot be released become permanent residents at Carolina Raptor Center or another facility that can care for them.</p>\n<p>Over the years the center has grown in size and complexity—helped along the way by the 300+ Boy Scouts who have completed Eagle Scout projects on its grounds. Today the center is home to 85 permanent resident birds from all over the world, many of which can be seen from the Raptor Trail that encircles the center. One of the highlights of the trail is the eagle aviary, where visitors can take in the impressive sight of golden and bald eagles. Other species on display include a peregrine falcon, red-shouldered hawk, spectacled owl, and turkey vulture. </p>\n<p>In 2016, the center began a project that will expand its educational offerings and ability to care for injured birds of prey. This includes Quest, a newly-built facility that will house both the Latta Nature Center and Carolina Raptor Center along with exhibit space, indoor classrooms, and an amphitheater.</p>\n      ","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 01 Apr 2021 11:59:00 +0000","feedId":51,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"48dc037c7f0fc251cb4c130ee84cc936","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/media/W1siZiIsInVwbG9hZHMvcGxhY2VfaW1hZ2VzLzBiYzdlNGMzYmNkYTdhNzBmNl9CZWFfQ29sbGVlbl9XaWxsaWFtX0tydW1wZWxtYW5fMl9KRUVESVQgMi5qcGciXSxbInAiLCJjb252ZXJ0IiwiIl0sWyJwIiwiY29udmVydCIsIi1xdWFsaXR5IDgxIC1hdXRvLW9yaWVudCJdLFsicCIsInRodW1iIiwiMzAweDIwMCMiXV0/Bea_Colleen_William_Krumpelman_2_JEEDIT%202.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn72@2020_5/2021/04/03/04-49-42-762_f7fb7d988d2e622c.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617425381049},{"createdTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:41","updatedTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:41","title":"How the Pandemic Resurrected Britain's Ancient Borders","link":"https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/britain-ancient-borders-pandemic","description":"\n        <p>On a gray March day, Tracey Jones sits in her shuttered pub, contemplating the last six months and the invisible barrier just outside the door. The pub Jones took over in October, The Bridge Inn, is named for the nearby crossing over the Ceiriog River, which, along this stretch, marks the border between England and Wales. Jones’s establishment is in England, but the Welsh town of Chirk is just across the river. For years, the international border just a stone’s throw from the pub didn’t matter. “The majority of our regular drinkers are from Chirk,” says Jones. “Even though the pub is situated on the English side of the border, it’s really considered to be a predominantly Welsh pub.” COVID-19 changed all of that.</p>\n<p>Thanks to erratic and uncoordinated lockdowns—some ordered by London, others by the Welsh government in Cardiff—The Bridge Inn has been closed more than it’s been open since Jones started running it. She says she’s been able to serve customers for a grand total of seven weeks since autumn. The situation is especially ironic for Jones: “I was born and bred over the bridge in Chirk.”</p>\n<p>The course of the English-Welsh border in front of The Bridge Inn has changed little since it was first defined by an Anglo-Saxon king in the eighth century. Determined to stop Britons in the west from reclaiming their lost lands in the east, King Offa of Mercia constructed a line of defensive ditches and hillforts, augmented by natural barriers such as rivers. Known as Offa’s Dyke, over centuries the boundary evolved into little more than an administrative line on the map. People came and went as they pleased, until the pandemic resurrected the ancient border.</p>\n<p>As one of the countries within the United Kingdom, Wales has limited powers to write its own laws. In early 2020, as the spread of COVID-19 triggered regional travel bans and lockdowns, Welsh restrictions diverged from those in neighboring England. Police could fine British citizens suspected of crossing the border for non-essential reasons. In May, when England opened up for the summer, Wales stayed in lockdown. And so it went for much of the year, one country opening just as the other shut down.</p>\n<figure class=\"article-image-full-width contains-caption \"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/81608/image.jpg\" alt=\"article-image\" width=\"auto\" data-kind=\"article-image\" /></figure>\n<p>Jones says that when she began managing The Bridge Inn in October, “We were sure there wouldn’t be any further national lockdowns when we took over. How very wrong we were.” In November, England stayed open while Wales went into lockdown. Wales later emerged only for England to lock down.</p>\n<p>The Bridge Inn’s Welsh regulars had to find Welsh pubs to drink in when England was locked down but Wales was open. Welsh drinkers were welcome at the Stanton House Inn in Chirk, where landlord Mark Jones (no relation) has been pouring pints for the last 20 years. If Stanton House’s Jones served an English customer, however, he could be fined almost $14,000. “We’re about half a mile from the English border,” he says. “When England was in lockdown we were asked to turn strangers away if they had no identification, because they could have been crossing the border.”</p>\n<p>For the longtime publican, the rules made sense when both countries were in lockdown, but simply didn’t work when there was no coordination between the two countries. Says Stanton House’s Jones: “When England was open and we were closed, people just went from Wales to England. Our customers all crossed the border to (The Bridge Inn). I can’t blame them, having a pint after work is part of our working man’s life!”</p>\n<p>The situation was even more absurd a few miles along Offa’s Dyke to the south. Here, the border cuts straight down the main street of the village of Llanymynech. Stand on the eastern sidewalk and you’re in England; cross the road, and you’re in Wales. John Turner’s pub, The Dolphin Inn, is on the Welsh side of the street facing two rival pubs in England, just yards away. As in Chirk, there was an official expectation that Turner would restrict access to his Welsh pub when England was in lockdown. “Even though we know most of our customers, we wouldn't have known which side of the border they lived on,” says Turner. “This made it impossible to police.”</p>\n<figure class=\"article-image-full-width contains-caption \"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/81605/image.jpg\" alt=\"article-image\" width=\"auto\" data-kind=\"article-image\" /></figure>\n<p>In Llanymynech, the hardened border has affected more than the pub-goers. The town boasts an “international” golf course: Offa’s Dyke runs through the greens and fairways, leaving 15 holes in Wales and 3 holes in England. Secretary Sian Whiteoak says the club itself is affiliated with England’s golf union, but pays taxes in Wales. In early January, golf was legal in England but outlawed in Wales. English golfers teeing off at the club discovered that Offa’s Dyke was no longer just ancient history when the Welsh authorities—escorted by police—arrived to close down the course.</p>\n<p>The golfers left without incident, but British citizens being turned back, fined, or potentially arrested for crossing British borders is unprecedented. And it’s not just happening along Offa’s Dyke. The English-Scottish border, for example, first defined by the Treaty of York in 1237, has also been closed for non-essential crossings for much of the pandemic. There, the hardened border, on the heels of the U.K.’s departure from the European Union, coincides with revived calls for a referendum on Scottish independence.</p>\n<p>For communities on the Welsh-English border, the issue is not independence but a lack of coordination between the two countries’ pandemic policies. King Offa probably could not have imagined that a microscopic virus would prove more effective at dividing the countryside than all his hillforts and elaborate earthworks. Like many other small business owners affected by the resurrected ancient barrier, the pub landlords are making the best of the fluid situation.</p>\n<figure class=\"article-image-full-width contains-caption \"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/81606/image.jpg\" alt=\"article-image\" width=\"auto\" data-kind=\"article-image\" /></figure>\n<p>At The Bridge Inn, Jones is preparing a beer garden to serve patrons from both sides of the Ceiriog. “We plan to reopen on April 12th if given the go-ahead, as we’re fortunate enough to have some outside space,” she says.</p>\n<p>In Llanymynech, Turner wants to get back to pulling pints and serving customers, too, regardless of their nationality, just as the establishment has done since the 19th century—and possibly much longer. The year 1517 is inscribed on a beam above the back door, hinting that part of the building may predate the 16th century laws that officially annexed Wales to England. Llanymynech endured that, and will endure the pandemic, too. “We have a good business, with a fabulous customer base,” says Turner. “There are going to be further disruptions once lockdown is over, but we’re confident we will survive.”</p>\n      ","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 02 Apr 2021 15:30:00 +0000","feedId":51,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"3345f100dccf74d07b6f7ce59ce95d27","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Richard Collett","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/81608/image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn29@2020_4/2021/04/03/04-49-41-875_87965ab9fcd0992c.webp","https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/81605/image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn61@2020_6/2021/04/03/04-49-41-920_409825867a12ced8.webp","https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/81606/image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn44@2020_1/2021/04/03/04-49-42-077_ae823a195baf575f.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617425381051},{"createdTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:41","updatedTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:41","title":"Feast on These Recipes From America's National Parks","link":"https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/american-national-parks-recipes","description":"\n        <p>A visit to any one of the United States’ national parks will offer a feast for the senses, from the scent of wildflowers along the Great Smoky Mountains to the sound of a bird call bouncing off the walls of the Grand Canyon. But beyond postcard-perfect views and fresh air, the bounty of the land also lends itself to delicious food at restaurants inside the parks. Blackberries, which so plentifully grow in the Blue Ridge Mountains, star in Shenandoah National Park's signature ice-cream pie, while on the other side of the country, the flavors of the desert infuse the Grand Canyon's famous salmon tostada.</p>\n<p>Even if you can’t get away for National Parks Week, you can still taste the flavors of these natural wonders at home. From popovers to campfire beans, here are six recipes for the culinary delights within national parks.</p>\n<h2 class=\"article-subheading-pre-rd\"><span style=\"font-family: sans-serif;\">Oasis Date-Nut Bread<br /></span><span style=\"font-family: sans-serif;\">Death Valley National Park</span></h2>\n<p>Despite its name, one thing grows very well in California's Death Valley, the hottest and driest of all the national parks. For years, date palm groves in this desert region have produced tons of the sugary-sweet fruit.<br /><br />At the Oasis at Death Valley resort, located within the park, date-nut bread is an undying classic. Served at its restaurants and sold at the general store, the date-nut bread is sweet and dense, and comes with a long pedigree. Ever since the site’s conversion from a ranch to a resort in the 1930s, date bread has been a favorite with visitors. While the date palms at the resort are now only ornamental (they once produced 200 tons of fruit <a href=\"https://www.oasisatdeathvalley.com/connect/stories/dates-and-prickly-pears-and-pomegranates-oh-my/\">every year</a>), visitors still buy fresh-baked loaves of date-nut bread before venturing back into the desert.<br /><br />If you're not planning on heading to Death Valley for this bread, <a href=\"https://www.cooks.com/recipe/6m7ak6gs/death-valley-date-nut-bread.html\">here's a recipe.</a></p>\n<figure class=\" contains-caption \"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/81600/image.jpg\" alt=\"article-image\" width=\"auto\" data-kind=\"article-image\" /></figure>\n<h2 class=\"article-subheading-pre-rd\"><strong>Roosevelt Lodge Baked Beans<br /></strong><strong>Yellowstone National Park </strong></h2>\n<p>Long before it became a Yellowstone campground, the area around Tower Fall served as a rest stop for indigenous bison hunters, fur trappers, and explorers. Three decades after the park’s founding in 1872, the campground received a tourist-friendly makeover. Early 20th-century guests slept in striped tents and flocked to a larger, communal tent for meals and singalongs. In the 1920s, log cabins replaced the tents and the site became the dude ranch–themed vacation spot known as Roosevelt Lodge.</p>\n<p>Today, among the cabins, corrals, and horse-drawn covered wagons, visitors can still sample cowboy fare. A standard “Old West Dinner Cookout” includes steak, strong coffee brewed over a campfire, and Roosevelt Lodge’s famed baked beans. Hearty, sweet, and savory, the dish blends four different types of beans with ground beef, bacon, and brown sugar.<br /><br />To taste this Yellowstone campfire classic, try <a href=\"https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/member/views/roosevelt-lodge-baked-beans-52833021\">Roosevelt Lodge’s recipe</a>.</p>\n<figure class=\" contains-caption \"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/81597/image.jpg\" alt=\"article-image\" width=\"auto\" data-kind=\"article-image\" /></figure>\n<h2 class=\"article-second-subheading-pre-rd article-subheading-pre-rd\"><strong>Jordan Pond House Popovers<br /></strong>Acadia National Park</h2>\n<p>In the early 20th century, the eastern United States had no national parks. That changed with the establishment of Acadia National Park in 1916. Beloved for its granite peaks and sweeping coastal views, it’s both Maine’s only national park and one of the nation’s most-visited. And many of those visitors flock to Jordan Pond House for a popover or three.<br /><br />A popover is a light-as-air, eggy pastry about the size of a muffin, and Jordan Pond House, whose existence long predates the park, has served them since 1895. John D. Rockefeller actually bought and donated the eatery to the park, enabling it to bring golden popovers to visitors ever since. Often, it’s a gargantuan effort to feed so many hungry hikers. During high-season afternoon teas and lunches, customers gobble up to 6,000 popovers a day.<br /><br />You can make these popular puffs at home <a href=\"https://www.nationalparkstraveler.org/2012/04/cooking-parks-popovers-acadia-national-park9755\">with simple ingredients</a>.

The El Tovar hotel has welcomed guests since 1905, including such luminaries as Teddy Roosevelt and Albert Einstein. After taking in nearby petroglyphs and admiring the shifting colors of the painted desert, modern visitors can order colorful local cuisine in El Tovar’s dining room. The salmon tostada is the restaurant’s signature dish, consisting of a salmon fillet topped with fire-roasted corn salsa and lime-infused sour cream, on a bed of greens and baked corn tortillas. For additional desert flavor, the greens are drizzled in a tequila-and-prickly-pear vinaigrette.<br /><br />Even if you can’t make it to the Grand Canyon, you can transport yourself there by <a href=\"https://boulderlocavore.com/the-grand-canyon-salmon-tostadas-recipe-el-tovar/\">making El Tovar's salmon tostada at home</a>.</p>\n<figure class=\" contains-caption \"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/81567/image.jpg\" alt=\"article-image\" width=\"auto\" data-kind=\"article-image\" /></figure>\n<h2 class=\"article-second-subheading-pre-rd article-subheading-pre-rd\"><strong>Signal Mountain Lodge Wild Game Chili<br /></strong>Grand Teton National Park</h2>\n<p>Everyone has their own chili recipe, and the Signal Mountain Lodge within Grand Teton National Park is no different. It’s just that their chili is made with elk meat, or sometimes bison, dressed up with two kinds of beans and two kinds of chili powder.<br /><br />Elk-based chili is an appropriate signature dish for Grand Teton. This vast Wyoming park does allow elk hunting to control the population, though hunting as a whole is not allowed at other national parks. Otherwise, the park is a hotspot for boating, climbing the soaring Tetons, and enjoying some of the world’s best trout fishing. In fact, Signal Mountain Lodge got its start in the early 20th century as a humble fishing retreat, long before it became the sprawling complex it is today.<br /><br />There’s no need, though, to fish around for the lodge’s official chili recipe, since it’s <a href=\"https://www.nationalparkstraveler.org/2010/02/dining-parks-elk-chili-grand-teton-national-parks-signal-mountain-lodge5386\">available here.</a></p>\n<figure class=\" contains-caption \"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/81568/image.jpg\" alt=\"article-image\" width=\"auto\" data-kind=\"article-image\" /></figure>\n<h2 class=\"article-subheading-pre-rd\"><strong>Skyland Mile-High Blackberry Ice Cream Pie<br /></strong>Shenandoah National Park</h2>\n<p>Legislators inspired by the West’s Yosemite and Yellowstone first proposed an ambitiously large park in the South in 1901. It didn’t become a reality until 1935, but ever since, Shenandoah National Park has stretched almost 200,000 miles over the Appalachian mountains. Known for its glorious fall colors, waterfalls, and the glorious Skyline Drive along the tops of the Blue Ridge Mountains, it’s hard to believe that this park is only 75 miles away from Washington, D.C.<br /><br />A century ago, the land where the park now stands was covered in chestnut trees. Sadly, a blight wiped out most of the chestnuts. Comfort yourself, instead, with Mile-High Blackberry Ice Cream Pie, the specialty of the Skyland lodge, located at the highest point of Skyline Drive. A single slice is enough for several people, which makes sense, considering that each pie is stuffed with half a gallon of blackberry ice cream, blackberry compote, and meringue. The pie is an homage to the thickets of blackberries that cover the mountain every summer. Beyond the pie, the park’s restaurants also hold a yearly Blackberry Delight festival, selling plenty of foods featuring the blackberry.<br /><br />As for the ice cream pie, here’s the recipe, courtesy of Skyland.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong style=\"text-align: center;\">Skyland’s Mile-High Blackberry Ice Cream Pie</strong></p>\n<p>Ingredients<br /><em>½ gallon blackberry ice cream</em><br /><em>1 graham cracker pie crust, either homemade or store-bought</em></p>\n<p>Meringue<br /><em>4 pasteurized egg whites, at room temperature</em><br /><em>½ teaspoon salt</em><br /><em>1 cup powdered sugar</em><br /><em>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</em></p>\n<p>Blackberry Compote<br /><em>2 cups frozen blackberries</em><br /><em>¼ cup orange juice</em><br /><em>1 ½ to 2 cups sugar</em><br /><em>1/8 cup lemon juice</em><br /><em>1/8 cup cornstarch</em></p>\n<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>\n<p>1. Purchase or prepare the graham cracker pie crust. Can be baked but not necessary. If you prefer to bake your own, be sure the crust is completely cooled before adding the ice cream.</p>\n<p>2. Add blackberry ice cream to the crust. Smooth out the ice cream and put it in the freezer for approximately three hours, or until it is very hard.</p>\n<p>3. Once the ice cream is frozen hard, make the meringue. Put all the meringue ingredients in a mixing bowl and beat on high for three minutes, or until soft peaks form.</p>\n<p>4. Spread the meringue on top of the ice cream. Swirl the meringue into peaks, then put the pie back into the freezer and leave overnight.</p>\n<p>5. Before serving, prepare the blackberry compote. Put all the compote ingredients, except the cornstarch, into a pot. Cook on medium-low, stirring as needed to keep the mixture from sticking. Cook the compote down to a syrupy consistency. Then, add the cornstarch a little at a time, while still stirring, until thickened.</p>\n<p>6. When ready to serve the pie, brown the meringue with a torch. Cut and serve the pie with blackberry compote drizzled on top. If available, add a few fresh blackberries for more color.</p>\n      ","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 02 Apr 2021 00:35:00 +0000","feedId":51,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"375dba14d48551bf3308212ec0d59d6b","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Anne Ewbank and Sam O'Brien ","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/81600/image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn17@2020_2/2021/04/03/04-49-42-076_0509457b8fbf19a4.webp","https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/81597/image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn1@2020_1/2021/04/03/04-49-41-934_033686cdc5c5da2f.webp","https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/81599/image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn27@2020_6/2021/04/03/04-49-42-047_0433f9a32513b16a.webp","https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/81567/image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn87@2020_4/2021/04/03/04-49-43-142_0d5c7e8f6a1593ed.webp","https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/81568/image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn95@2020_3/2021/04/03/04-49-43-251_091409891b4a4b3b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617425381048},{"createdTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:41","updatedTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:41","title":"How Locals on Mauritius United To Fight an Oil Spill With Their Own Hair","link":"https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/mauritius-wakashio-oil-spill-cleanup","description":"\n        <p>Night had fallen on Mahebourg, a bustling trade town on the southeast coast of Mauritius, when what would come to be called the “people’s factory zone” met for the first time. It was an enterprise born of necessity: A crisis was unfolding only a few miles offshore, in the pristine waters from which many of Mahebourg’s residents earn their livelihoods. That first August night, just a handful of locals showed up to rally around what seemed like a dubious idea. To protect the coast from a devastating oil spill, they would make booms from whatever they could find: single-use plastic bottles, fibrous sugar cane waste, even human hair. Word of the DIY initiative spread. Within hours, hundreds of Mauritians came to the people’s factory zone to contribute whatever they could. For weeks on end, an expanding army of islanders worked round the clock, even cutting off their own hair to add to the growing lengths of handmade booms.</p>\n<p>“I was surrounded at all times by 200 to 300 volunteers, from fisherfolks and skippers to teachers and students, from homemakers and children to off-duty police officers,” says Virgine Parisot, one of the volunteers. “It felt like the birth of a new movement.”</p>\n<p>Mauritius, an island nation of less than 800 square miles, rises up from the Indian Ocean about 700 miles east of Madagascar. The main island’s mountainous interior is fringed with beaches, lagoons, reefs, and banks of seagrass renowned for their biodiversity. On July 25, 2020, MV Wakashio, a Japanese-owned cargo ship heading to Brazil, ran aground on a coral reef just off the southeast coast. Two weeks later, oil began to leak from the wrecked ship, heading for Mahebourg and the nearby nature reserve Blue Bay Marine Park. It would become, according to some scientists, the island’s worst ecological disaster.</p>\n<figure class=\"article-image-full-width contains-caption \"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/81510/image.jpg\" alt=\"article-image\" width=\"auto\" data-kind=\"article-image\" /></figure>\n<p>“Environmentalists, fisherfolks, and others who make their living from the sea had called for help from the government, but they had only been met with silence,” says Yolande Hennequin, a local marine guide. So, leftist political party Resistanz ek Alternativ (ReA), which focuses on social and environmental justice, decided to take action.</p>\n<p>“The administration showed its inability to act quickly, and it felt like criminal negligence toward our country and our ocean,” says Dany Marie, one of the founding members of ReA. Another member, David Sauvage, had researched low-cost, low-tech solutions and come up with the idea of the handmade oil booms. That first night in Mahebourg, the small group started gathering materials. Marie made a few calls to convince some hardware stores to open their doors, while Hennequin and others gathered straw from nearby sugarcane fields, learning as they went. “At first, the work was tentative,” says Hennequin. “We did not even bring a sheet to carry the cane straw back to the waterfront.” They persisted, and word spread, including via social media. In the early morning, fishermen joined in and taught them better sewing techniques. Within hours, the growing team had successfully made and tested an 80-foot boom.</p>\n<p>As the sun rose, Hennequin left the scene to take a quick shower. When she returned, she found more than a hundred new faces had arrived to help. “I was so stunned, I had to sit down,” she says. Within the next few days, more locals came. They stuffed nylon netting with hair, cane trash, and other absorbent materials, as well as empty plastic bottles to keep the booms afloat. An assembly line took shape: one volunteer would sew the boom while another stuffed it, passing the completed piece to boat crews who deployed them around the lagoon and other threatened sites.</p>\n<figure class=\"article-image-full-width contains-caption \"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/81508/image.jpg\" alt=\"article-image\" width=\"auto\" data-kind=\"article-image\" /></figure>\n<p>Other helpers distributed food and beverages to the boom-makers. As people rushed to donate their hair, barbers volunteered to snip and shave. Although the government had declared large swathes of the southeast as restricted areas, the movement continued to attract people from far beyond Mahebourg. Restaurants throughout the region distributed free food as the number of volunteers grew. The sugarcane and textile industries provided cane straw and began mass-producing stronger booms. Tourism app developer Discover Mauritius created maps to pinpoint sites where volunteers were needed. Even other countries joined: Australia collected more than 28 tons of hair for use in the booms. “It was all these actions that showed how resourceful and united Mauritians can be when it comes to protecting our homes and our natural heritage,” says Shaama Sandooyea, a marine biologist and environmental activist who was among the volunteers.</p>\n<p>Within its first two weeks, the people’s factory zone evolved into a well-oiled machine, producing hundreds of feet of booms per hour, according to Marie, and eventually removing 75 percent of the oil from the coastline. Although male voices dominated media coverage as the disaster response unfolded, many of those who joined or led the effort were women. Virginie Orange, for example, captains a boat she also owns, while Parisot runs a small diner. The two women ran one of the food stations that kept volunteers fed over the long hours of labor. “I would start at 9:30 a.m., stay until 7:30 p.m., go back home and come back at 9 p.m. until around midnight,” says Parisot.</p>\n<figure class=\"article-image-full-width contains-caption \"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/81512/image.jpg\" alt=\"article-image\" width=\"auto\" data-kind=\"article-image\" /></figure>\n<p>The volunteers sacrificed more than time. The long-term effects of the spill remain unknown, but many of those making or deploying booms reported a range of health problems. “During the cleanup some people wore their personal protective gear, but I, like many others who did not, started getting coughs, nausea, and headaches,” says Sandooyea. Orange adds that, for the first few weeks after the spill, “I suffered from nosebleeds and faintness. Now when I go into the lagoon, I still get skin eruptions all over my body.” The oil spill also laid bare the precarious economic position of those whose livelihoods depend on the sea.</p>\n<p>Mauritius had already closed its borders due to COVID-19, and the aftermath of the spill has meant further restrictions on access to the lagoon. Boat captain Orange has seen a dip in her business, even as she incurred additional expenses associated with keeping her boat anchored for an extended period. Parisot, a single mother, had saved up for eight years to open a small diner, navigating loans and a difficult bureaucracy in the process. “I wanted to offer seafood so as to support local fisherfolks, and where I am currently located, I cater mostly to those who subsist on the sea and on tourism. But right now, the economy in Mahebourg is at a standstill,” she says. “How am I supposed to work?”</p>\n<figure class=\"article-image-full-width contains-caption \"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/81511/image.jpg\" alt=\"article-image\" width=\"auto\" data-kind=\"article-image\" /></figure>\n<p>Parisot is among the many small business owners affected by what Marie calls the two-fold shipwreck: the virus outbreak and the Wakashio spill. Beyond the immediate health and economic fallout for Mauritians, the environmental impact is substantial. More than 50 melon-head whales (<em>Peponocephala electra</em>) alone turned up dead along the affected coastline.

Measured by their planet-warming power, methane-filled livestock belches are the equivalent of 850 coal plants burning year-round. But scientists have found that spicing up cattle feed with a little seaweed can dramatically reduce the methane they produce, <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0247820\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">according to a new study out March 17</a>.</p>\n<p>The promise that feed additives could make cows more climate-friendly can seem too good to be true, and it often is.

Scientists began <a href=\"https://foodtank.com/news/2017/06/seaweed-reduce-cow-methane-emission/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">studying the effects of putting seaweed in cow feed in 2005</a>, and as the experiments have moved out of the lab and into the barn, the promising results held up. The latest study, <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0247820\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">published in the journal <em>PLoS One</em></a>, shows that when 21 beef cattle ate a little bit of seaweed—less than a cup—mixed in with their feed each day, they burped out 82 percent less methane.</p>\n<p>“This is much more than I expected, to be honest,” said Ermias Kebreab, an animal scientist who studies greenhouse gas emissions at the University of California, Davis. “I didn’t think we would get 80 percent reduction—that’s absolutely huge.”</p>\n<p>A company working on the problem of growing and supplying seaweed to farmers, Blue Ocean Barns, helped pay for the study. Blue Ocean Barns obviously has an interest in showing that this works, so in addition to seaweed, take these results with a grain of salt. But just a grain: Kebreab is a highly respected scientist, paid by your tax dollars, and another study in 2019, funded by the government, got <a href=\"https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2019-06/ps-sfa061719.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">similar results</a> with dairy cows.</p>\n<p>This new study asked the kinds of questions that will determine whether seaweed succeeds in the real world. Would its effectiveness wear off over time? Would it still work if the cattle ate more grass and less corn? And would the seaweed impart a scent of low tide to the beef?</p>\n<figure class=\"article-image-full-width contains-caption \"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/81293/image.jpg\" alt=\"article-image\" width=\"auto\" data-kind=\"article-image\" /></figure>\n<p>The answers were positive, by and large. It didn’t matter that the seaweed was 3 years old, and it kept working throughout the five-month trial. The cattle fattened up just fine. Afterward, researchers cooked some steaks on a George Foreman grill and taste testers found it indistinguishable from other ribeyes.</p>\n<p>The results, however, did depend on the rest of the diet. Just like humans, cattle that eat more fiber are gassier. The study showed that the seaweed still worked in cattle eating mostly roughage, just not as well—cutting burps by 60 percent instead of 80 percent.</p>\n<p>But even at the low end, a 60 percent reduction is huge. Getting grass-fed cattle to produce less methane is crucial, because most cow-based emissions come from cattle grazing on hilly pastures, rather than those chewing corn in feedlots.</p>\n<p>So how long until ranchers start putting seaweed into their feed? There are still two major hurdles. The Food and Drug Administration classifies feed additives as drugs, so scientists need to complete clinical trials on cattle eating seaweed, which Kebreab said are already underway. Companies also need to figure out how to grow this red seaweed efficiently enough to provide it at a low cost. <a href=\"https://www.blueoceanbarns.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Blue Ocean Barns</a> and another company, <a href=\"https://symbrosia.co/seaweed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Symbrosia</a>, are experimenting with seaweed farming techniques in <a class=\"destination-link place-destination-link\" href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/things-to-do/hawaii\">Hawai’i</a>.</p>\n<p>Scientifically, it works. Profitably? That’s the next question.</p>\n      ","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 30 Mar 2021 15:32:00 +0000","feedId":51,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"1ef0e7150ee7f8c7dccd6cea4ef0dd48","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Nathanael Johnson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/81292/image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn25@2020_5/2021/04/03/04-49-42-025_1ca99f795a2983e8.webp","https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/81293/image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn32@2020_5/2021/04/03/04-49-41-979_42590600f876a1d3.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617425381028},{"createdTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:41","updatedTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:41","title":"Gyeongju Seokbinggo in Gyeongju, South Korea","link":"https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gyeongju-seokbinggo","description":"\n        <p><img alt=\"The entrance was made facing the direction that allowed in the least amount of warmth. \" data-width=\"1080\" data-height=\"810\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/media/W1siZiIsInVwbG9hZHMvcGxhY2VfaW1hZ2VzL2JiYTI3OTFkLTFmZTYtNDY0OC04ZjNmLWU4Y2I4NDdiZDc4MmYxMzI5MmZjMjI4MDA4ZjYyNF9GQl9JTUdfMTYxNDQwMTQ0NDg0NC5qcGciXSxbInAiLCJjb252ZXJ0IiwiLWF1dG8tb3JpZW50ICJdLFsicCIsInRodW1iIiwiMTA3NXg3MTcrMCs5MyJdLFsicCIsImNvbnZlcnQiLCItcXVhbGl0eSA4MSAtYXV0by1vcmllbnQiXSxbInAiLCJ0aHVtYiIsIjMwMHgyMDAjIl1d/FB_IMG_1614401444844.jpg\" /></p> <p>A small protrusion resembling the surrounding burial tumuli protrudes from the ground in a quiet corner of Wolseong Fortress. However, this one in particular had a very different purpose.</p>\n<p>Seokbinggo literally means \"stone ice storage.\" It is effectively an icebox made of stone and was the secret behind Korea's ability to have ice in the middle of summer during the 1700s.</p>\n<p>This was a storage room where ice blocks cut from frozen lakes and rivers were taken during the winter for storage. They would then be used during the warm summer months.</p>\n<p>The key to its success was in its clever design, half of Seokbinggo is underground while the other half is above ground. This allows the internal temperature to stay relatively stable despite any rapid increase in the outside air temperature. </p>\n<p>To keep air from entering the chamber, a burial mound was created on top by mixing dirt and rocks. Next, the ceiling was fitted with ventilation shafts. When it was warm outside and the air inside warmed up, it then exited through the shafts. Letting the warm air escape in this manner helped keep the ice cool for a little longer.</p>\n<p>The floor, walls, and arched ceiling are made of granite. The walls are covered with limestone and are designed to keep off moisture and water. The floor is slanted, which allowed melted ice to funnel out. At the end of the sloped floor is a drain. Peering inside the metal gate, visitors will still be able to feel the coolness of the structure. </p>\n<p>This seokbinggo was moved to its current location in 1742, which can be verified by the keystone scripts on the entrance and the monument standing next to the storage.</p>\n<p>There are only seven seokbinggo still in existence today.

Residents of the town were employed by the hundreds, as they extracted millions of dollars worth of gold and silver.</p>\n<p>The town grew to its heights after the Alpine Tunnel west was completed, at the time the most expensive and highest altitude rail line ever constructed. The Alpine Tunnel west led directly to St. Elmo and allowed the town to reach around 2,000 residents in 1881.</p>\n<p>The town originally had only a handful of restaurants, a few hotels, a newspaper, and a diverse number of other businesses. St. Elmo was a typical frontier town and relied heavily on the mining industry. The latter half of the 1880s would bring a slow death to the town. Many of the mines were producing a low-grade ore that made for a less than profitable endeavor. In 1890, a major fire ripped through the area causing a portion of the town, mostly the commercial district, to burn. After structures were rebuilt, eight years later a second fire left most of the town in ruins. </p>\n<p>The town continued to experience ups and downs through the 1900s. The tunnel closed in 1910 and soon the rails were removed. It’s not so much a ghost town anymore as there are a few residents nearby. The locals own all of the historic buildings and work to preserve them. Donation boxes are littered around the town to help with restoration efforts. </p>\n      ","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 02 Apr 2021 17:00:00 +0000","feedId":51,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"76f89a746679bd662923c4498e586c39","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/media/W1siZiIsInVwbG9hZHMvcGxhY2VfaW1hZ2VzLzA3MjE2Nzg5LTIzOGMtNGZhMC1hZDA1LTNlNTg5ZTk5OTgzYmVkMjFmNWU1N2QwMmUyYjZjNV9Db21vLmpwZyJdLFsicCIsImNvbnZlcnQiLCItYXV0by1vcmllbnQgIl0sWyJwIiwidGh1bWIiLCI0ODIweDMyMTMrMCsxMCJdLFsicCIsImNvbnZlcnQiLCItcXVhbGl0eSA4MSAtYXV0by1vcmllbnQiXSxbInAiLCJ0aHVtYiIsIjMwMHgyMDAjIl1d/Como.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn7@2020_3/2021/04/03/04-49-42-034_9432b22dcb2deb3a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617425381028},{"createdTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:41","updatedTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:41","title":"Mason's Memorial Pillars in Edinburgh, Scotland","link":"https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/masons-pillars","description":"\n        <p><img alt=\"Mason&#39;s Memorial Pillars\" data-width=\"719\" data-height=\"960\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/media/W1siZiIsInVwbG9hZHMvcGxhY2VfaW1hZ2VzLzJhNmE4NDlmLWRjNjctNDllNC1hODEyLTRiMjg0NjExMDc4YzUwZTZjMWE5ZjY4ZWFhMWJhZl8xMzMzOTI0OTlfMTAxNTc4Mzc2NTQ2NjcwODNfNDI0NTQzMjUzOTk4NjYxMDkzOV9uLmpwZyJdLFsicCIsImNvbnZlcnQiLCItYXV0by1vcmllbnQgIl0sWyJwIiwidGh1bWIiLCI3MTl4NDc5KzArMjEyIl0sWyJwIiwiY29udmVydCIsIi1xdWFsaXR5IDgxIC1hdXRvLW9yaWVudCJdLFsicCIsInRodW1iIiwiMzAweDIwMCMiXV0/133392499_10157837654667083_4245432539986610939_n.jpg\" /></p> <p>Some thirty years after the <a href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/crystal-palace\">Great London Exposition </a>took place, <a class=\"destination-link place-destination-link\" title=\"Things to do in Edinburgh, Scotland\" href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/things-to-do/edinburgh-scotland\" data-destination-link-kind=\"place\" data-geo-id=\"256\" data-title=\"Edinburgh, Scotland\" data-slug=\"edinburgh-scotland\">Edinburgh</a> hosted its own presentation. Between the months of May and October 1886, The Meadows was home to an exhibit showcasing Scottish advancements in Art, Science, and Industry. This trade fair attracted nearly three million visitors to the capital city. Over 100 years later, there would be little left to remind future generations of what once took place at this location</p>\n<p>Fortunately, at the westerly end of Melville Drive stands two 26 foot pillars, each topped with seven-foot-tall unicorns, the national emblem of <a class=\"destination-link place-destination-link\" title=\"Things to do in Scotland\" href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/things-to-do/scotland\" data-destination-link-kind=\"place\" data-geo-id=\"4406\" data-title=\"Scotland\" data-slug=\"scotland\">Scotland</a>. These columns once marked the entrance to this phenomenal World's Fair-like showcase. These stone sentries were designed by Sir James Gowans and hand-carved by the Master Builders and Operative Masons of Edinburgh and Leith. They were a gift to the city and contain some unusual features.</p>\n<p>Inspecting the pillars more closely, one will notice that the columns are broken into sections of different stones with a name etched into each segment. The moniker indicates the area where the rock was quarried. This is also an ingenious method to show how time and environment wear on the individual sections. There are also symbols carved next to each segment, these are also mason marks to indicate the type of work done on the stone.</p>\n<p>Just below each of the stoic prancing unicorns is a circular band of individual insignias. These signify the heraldic crests, which include; the Imperial, Scottish, English, and Irish Arms, the Coat of Arms of 19 Scottish Burghs, and the Crest of the Edinburgh Masons.</p>\n<p>The Edinburgh International Exhibition of 1886 was quite expansive, it covered the entire area from these pillars to the green pavilion located next to Jawbone Walk. It reached a height of 120 feet and was festooned with emblems of the zodiac. Besides these columns, there are little remains that indicate what once transpired here.

After moving from her hometown of Mumbai to California, she wanted to learn more about the historical forces shaping her own identity and experience as a queer woman of color in the United States. A food photographer, Javeri Kadri turned to culinary history to better understand the history of global empire. For more than a century before the British crown officially made India a colony, the British East India company—a private corporation that had a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/04/east-india-company-original-corporate-raiders\">monopoly over much of the South Asian spice trade</a>—ruled the subcontinent.</p>\n<p>Spice trading, Javeri Kadri realized, hasn’t changed much from its colonial roots. Often, the people growing spices are disconnected from the global marketplace by middlemen, who take the lion's share of the profits. In 2017, following a series of sourcing trips to spice farms in India, Javeri Kadri founded Diaspora Co., a small spice company that directly sells seasonings from South Asian farms to U.S. and global consumers.</p>\n<p>Diaspora Co. is one of a number of small companies bent on challenging the colonial legacy of the spice trade. In contrast to large spice companies, some of which have dominated the industry for hundreds of years, these endeavors tend to work directly with local farmers and are owned by people grounded in the cultural and culinary contexts of the spices they sell.</p>\n<figure class=\" contains-caption \"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/81603/image.jpg\" alt=\"article-image\" width=\"auto\" data-kind=\"article-image\" /></figure>\n<p>According to Greg Prang, co-founder of Culinary Culture Connections, which partners with South American Indigenous groups and nonprofits to import their products to the U.S., equitable spice sourcing should go beyond a “fair trade” label. It should focus on building relationships with producers and supporting their autonomy over traditional cultural and culinary practices.</p>\n<p>“Fair trade is kind of a front for big corporations to say they’re doing something in respect of sustainability,” he says. Prang speaks from experience. He was trained as an anthropologist and worked in consumer research for multinational food companies for years. When corporations talked about leveraging fair trade branding for profit, “I remember laughing and saying, ‘If you don’t believe it, don’t do it.’”</p>\n<p>Prang, Javeri Kadri, and others on this list believe in the importance of equitable sourcing—and they sell some tasty spices, too.</p>\n<figure class=\" contains-caption \"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/81528/image.jpg\" alt=\"article-image\" width=\"auto\" data-kind=\"article-image\" /></figure>\n<h2 class=\"article-subheading-pre-rd\"><a href=\"https://www.diasporaco.com/pages/about\">Diaspora Co.</a></h2>\n<h3 class=\"article-second-subheading-pre-rd\">Oakland, California</h3>\n<p>Besides bringing fresh spices to customers, Diaspora Co. states an intention to “redistribute power away from solely the trader and instead empower its farmers, laborers, and the earth,” according to their website.

As a young, European-raised Chinese chef exploring her roots in Chengdu, Gao began serving pop-up dinners out of her home kitchen. These dinner parties grew into a roving global series, with Gao lugging bags full of Chinese spices wherever she travelled. In 2018, she decided to turn the suitcase spice hustle into a full-fledged business. Gao’s first Kickstarter became the highest-funded craft food project in the site’s history, and Fly By Jing was born.</p>\n<p>“I was completely blown away by the reception,” Gao writes via email. “It showed me that people were ready and excited to embrace these flavors.” Gao named the company after Chengdu’s “fly” restaurants, hole-in-the-wall joints so tasty that diners flock to them like flies. She also affixed her given name, Jing, to the company title, rather than Jenny, the name she’d gone by for most of her life.</p>\n<p>The company’s first product is still its signature: <a href=\"https://flybyjing.com/shop/sichuan-chili-crisp/?variant=31033340461114\">Sichuan Chili Crisp</a>, a spicy, savory sauce that will leave your mouth tingling. The company has expanded with a handful of other offerings, such as <a href=\"https://flybyjing.com/shop/3-year-aged-doubanjiang/\">doubanjiang</a>, aged fava bean paste, and <a href=\"https://flybyjing.com/shop/zhong-dumpling-sauce\">zhong dumpling sauce</a>, made of soy sauce, garlic, mushrooms, and spices.

For years, he worked as a consumer researcher for companies like Nestle, Kraft, Heinz, and Coca-Cola. “Which I hated,” he says. An anthropologist by training, he had also spent years researching environmental sustainability in the Amazon, as had his cofounder, Brian Kermath. They drew on this part of their experience, as well as the burgeoning Native food movement in Latin America, when they founded Culinary Culture Connections in 2015.</p>\n<p>Culinary Culture Connections focuses on spices, spice mixes, and sauces produced by Indigenous collectives in the Amazon. Their most popular product is <a href=\"https://culinarycultureconnections.com/products/pimenta-banewa\">Pimenta Baniwa</a>, an intensely spicy <a href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/foods/baniwa-jiquitaia\">chili-and-salt mix, also called <em>jiquitaia,</em></a> made by the Baniwa indigenous community in Brazil’s Içana River Basin. The rich mix is a reflection of the Baniwa people’s deep cultural connection to the dozens of hot pepper cultivars they’ve developed in their homeland, and is produced in partnership with the Instituto Socioambiental, an environmental nonprofit that supports Indigenous land rights.</p>\n<p>Prang is more interested in quality, sustainability, and Indigenous leadership than in ramping up production. “It’s small scale because of the nature of the trade,” he says. “It’s not stuff that’s ever going to be in Costco shelves.” That works just fine for the company’s small group of devoted consumers. “They tried it, they liked it, and they keep coming back,” Prang proudly says.</p>\n<figure class=\" contains-caption \"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/81534/image.jpg\" alt=\"article-image\" width=\"auto\" data-kind=\"article-image\" /></figure>\n<h2 class=\"article-subheading-pre-rd\"><a href=\"https://www.iyafoods.com/collections/spices-seasonings\">Iya Foods</a></h2>\n<h3 class=\"article-second-subheading-pre-rd\">North Aurora, Illinois</h3>\n<p>Toyin Kolawole, founder of Iya Foods, once worked at her family’s fast food restaurant and pharmacy in Nigeria.

When she moved to the United States, cooking food from home kept her grounded. “But the spices I found at grocery stores were completely off in flavors, fragrances, colors, and textures,” she says. Bandaranayake started sourcing spices from Sri Lankan farmers for her own use, then launched Cinnamon Tree Organics in late 2019 in order to sell the same spices to the broader community.</p>\n<p>Today, the company offers single-origin spices, including <a href=\"https://www.cinnamontreeorganics.com/collections/all/products/single-origin-ceylon-cinnamon-sticks\">Ceylon cinnamon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cinnamontreeorganics.com/collections/all/products/organic-black-peppercorn\">black peppercorns</a>. “Our Ceylon cinnamon is native Sri Lankan \"true\" cinnamon,” says Bandaranayake. “This is different from the product sold as cinnamon in US grocery stores, which is mostly a spice in the same plant family called cassia.” It’s much milder, though the flavor is more complex.</p>\n<p>Many conventionally traded spices spend years in transport before reaching grocery store shelves, and lose freshness and flavor over time. Bandaranayake’s freshly dried black peppercorns, she says, have a much more vivid flavor than what most U.S. consumers are used to—the natural result of sourcing spices more directly from the communities that produce and use them.</p>\n      ","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 02 Apr 2021 21:00:00 +0000","feedId":51,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"a30769c3497ebd63cbda542a649b6b10","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Reina Gattuso","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/81603/image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn4@2020_5/2021/04/03/04-49-43-345_034626f0cbdba0a4.webp","https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/81528/image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn34@2020_4/2021/04/03/04-49-42-189_2407eae3d7d7d7cd.webp","https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/81527/image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn5@2020_1/2021/04/03/04-49-41-994_934021dfd70bc101.webp","https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/81562/image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn59@2020_6/2021/04/03/04-49-42-070_75a5e86f6a91b686.webp","https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/81535/image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn55@2020_1/2021/04/03/04-49-42-057_825c71e98ac28a05.webp","https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/81534/image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn14@2020_5/2021/04/03/04-49-41-977_c6d2f73dcff0c1df.webp","https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/81563/image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn36@2020_4/2021/04/03/04-49-42-102_64e751deeef43786.webp","https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/81543/image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn20@2020_1/2021/04/03/04-49-42-078_5f2faca8f7493170.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617425381051},{"createdTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:41","updatedTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:41","title":"The Australian Town That’s Gone Batty Over Its Bats","link":"https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/colac-otway-bat-war","description":"\n        <p class=\"BodyA\" style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"center\">The bat swivels around to regard us, eyes wide and confused, wings folded protectively across its salt-and-pepper body.

Flying foxes once dominated the skies here. Millions blotted out the stars as they soared from the boughs of the giant eucalypts, beeches, and blackwood trees that once towered across the region. But deforestation, climate change, food scarcity, and the increasing frequency of bushfires has reduced flying fox populations so severely that today they are listed as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. In 2019, Australia’s National Flying-fox Monitoring Program estimated that there were about 589,000 left in the wild. As urban sprawl replaces their natural habitat, flying foxes have been forced to establish colonies in city parks and forage for food in suburban backyards.</p>\n<figure class=\"article-image-full-width contains-caption \"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/81523/image.jpg\" alt=\"article-image\" width=\"auto\" data-kind=\"article-image\" /></figure>\n<p class=\"BodyA\" style=\"text-align: left;\">The state of Victoria is home to 11 known colonies, whose numbers fluctuate with the seasons, some reaching upwards of 50,000 bats. Several are located in urban green spaces and have, for the most part, been embraced by their hosts: The curator of the Warrnambool Botanic Gardens worked alongside Andy Meddick, a member of both the Animal Justice Party and the Victorian Legislative Council, to secure funding for a new irrigation system to reduce heat-stress deaths in its colony. Melbourne has built tourism around the colony in Yarra Bend Park. The Geelong City Council created educational programs to teach children about the bats roosting in Eastern Park. The Greater Bendigo City Council appealed to the public for help after Rosalind Park’s colony shrank from 20,000 to just 1,300 bats between October 2019 and January 2020. But then there’s Colac. Colac is the only town that just doesn’t seem to want them around.</p>\n<p class=\"BodyA\" style=\"text-align: left;\">The first flying foxes arrived in the Colac Botanic Gardens unexpectedly during summer 2016. The gardens’ heavy tree cover, close proximity to Lake Colac, and temperate microclimate provided the perfect conditions for a colony. However, neither the Colac Otway Shire Council, nor the volunteer-run Friends of the Colac Botanic Gardens advisory committee, were keen on the new residents.</p>\n<p class=\"BodyA\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Colac’s head gardener, Laurence Towers, told the <em>Colac Herald</em> in a December 2016 cover story about the bats, “I have noticed the mower disturbs them during the day so I hope they decide they’re not getting any sleep and move on.”</p>\n<figure class=\"article-image-full-width contains-caption \" style=\"text-align: left;\"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/81503/image.jpg\" alt=\"article-image\" width=\"auto\" data-kind=\"article-image\" /></figure>\n<p class=\"BodyA\" style=\"text-align: left;\">The Colac Botanic Gardens, established in 1865, is one of the largest botanical gardens in regional Victoria, proudly boasting seven native and exotic trees listed on the National Trust of Victoria’s Significant Trees Register. These trees, the Council claimed, would suffer irreparable harm if the bats were not removed. It is true that trees used as roosting sites by bats suffer stress and loss of leaf canopy—damage known as dieback and defoliation. In 2009, the Australian Research Centre for Urban Ecology found that in the Yarra Bend colony’s first five years, trees used for permanent roosting lost half of their leaves, while seasonal roosting sites experienced significantly less damage and were able to regenerate more quickly. Surprisingly, the percentage of defoliation seemed to decrease over time, with several trees experiencing epicormic growth—a phenomenon wherein extreme stress causes dormant buds to bloom—and fully recovering. Theoretically, the conditions of Colac’s small, seasonal colony would have minimal impact on the town’s botanic gardens. It didn’t matter. The bats had to go.</p>\n<p class=\"BodyA\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Flying foxes are often dismissed as pests, blamed for sullying green spaces used by humans with loud screeching, feces, and foul odor. In reality, they’re a keystone species, able to travel farther than any other pollinator, and therefore crucial for spreading seeds and keeping native plants genetically sustainable.</p>\n<p class=\"BodyA\" style=\"text-align: left;\">“They’re the night farmers,” says Virgo. “They can do the jobs that bees can’t do, and birds can’t do.” They are also surprisingly clean animals, who seldom eat where they sleep.</p>\n<figure class=\"article-image-full-width contains-caption \"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/81524/image.jpg\" alt=\"article-image\" width=\"auto\" data-kind=\"article-image\" /></figure>\n<p class=\"BodyA\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Although flying foxes are federally protected, only colonies that have been permanently established in one area for 10 or more years and contain 10,000 or more bats are considered nationally important and receive the full benefit of protection from culling, hunting, and relocation. But colonies of this size and permanence have become a rarity. As a result, the listed trees in the Colac Botanic Gardens, protected under the Heritage Act 1995, have taken precedence over the bats.</p>\n<p class=\"BodyA\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Operating without a permit, and openly encouraging the public to aid their efforts, the Friends of the Colac Botanic Gardens used dog whistles, sensor lights, and noisemakers to try and scare the bats away. Nothing worked. Flying foxes can’t hear dog whistles (only microbats can), and the sensor lights had little effect on the nocturnal creatures. By summer’s end, the colony, which at that time was only 200 strong, had moved on of its own accord. When the colony returned the following summer, however, there were thousands.</p>\n<p class=\"BodyA\" style=\"text-align: left;\">“The bats are a good example of a ‘community conundrum,’” says former councilor Chris Smith, who also served as the Council’s representative on the Friends of the Colac Botanic Gardens for a number of years. “It is getting to the point of killing the host trees. If we take a longer-term view and these wonderful trees are destroyed, the bats will need to move on regardless.”</p>\n<p>After an independent arborist gave three of the gardens’ heritage-listed trees a maximum of three years to live, the colony’s fate was sealed. Light towers were installed in the gardens, 44-gallon smoke drums were put in place, and noise pollution and water spouts were implemented. Yet the colony only grew in size, peaking at 6,500 in 2019. Bat conservation organizations and animal rights activists, including Virgo and Meddick, and an outpouring of concerned citizens, lobbied the Council to allow the bats to remain.</p>\n<figure class=\"article-image-full-width contains-caption \"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/81494/image.jpg\" alt=\"article-image\" width=\"auto\" data-kind=\"article-image\" /></figure>\n<p class=\"BodyA\" style=\"text-align: left;\">“[I]ndigenous species have a right to exist among us,” Meddick wrote in a public letter to the Council. “We have a historical and ethical responsibility to do our utmost to accommodate or help them.”</p>\n<p class=\"BodyA\" style=\"text-align: left;\">The community was divided. Many were supportive of the Council.</p>\n<p class=\"BodyA\" style=\"text-align: left;\">“The Botanical Gardens are a sanctuary for humans ... there are plenty more trees elsewhere [Otway National Park] where these bats can do their job for nature,” wrote one local, Jeff Cole, on the comment boards for the <em>Colac Herald</em>’s coverage of the dispersals.</p>\n<p class=\"BodyA\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Others were more forgiving, though they still thought the bats should go. “The Shire should implement long-term tree planting and potential roosting site development well before even talking about relocating the bats ... ” wrote another resident, Isabelle Higgins.</p>\n<p class=\"BodyA\" style=\"text-align: left;\">The Council estimates that it has spent $190,000 over two years on dispersal attempts, an amount many believe has been a colossal waste of money. “It’s not the same bats that they’re always dispersing,” Virgo says. “It’s different bats all the time. There is a 20 percent turnover every night.”</p>\n<p class=\"BodyA\" style=\"text-align: left;\">In August 2020, the Colac Otway Shire Council was granted an open-ended permit until 2023 allowing for dispersals between April and August, outside of the flying foxes’ birthing season.</p>\n<figure class=\"article-image-full-width contains-caption \"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/81526/image.jpg\" alt=\"article-image\" width=\"auto\" data-kind=\"article-image\" /></figure>\n<p class=\"BodyA\">“[The bats’] welfare will be a priority as we encourage them to move on or fly past our gardens and find a more suitable treed space to roost for their breeding season,” said the Council’s Infrastructure &#38; Leisure Services General Manager, Tony McGann, in response to the permit grant.</p>\n<p class=\"BodyA\" style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"center\">It has been several weeks since Dixie’s rescue. Her wing is healing, and although minor bone damage has slowed her recovery, she will be released soon. Unfortunately, her baby was never found.</p>\n<p class=\"BodyA\" style=\"text-align: left;\">The Council may have obtained its permit, but Colac’s bat conservationists did win a small victory. Last January, Virgo rescued a days-old flying fox pup that had fallen from its mother, which forced the Council to postpone its last scheduled dispersal for six months to allow the babies to mature. At present, no further dispersals are planned, and Virgo hopes the Council may still come around to the idea of allowing the bats to remain.</p>\n<p class=\"BodyA\" style=\"text-align: left;\">“There have only been a handful of rescues in the Colac Otway area,” Virgo points out, also noting that Colac is the only place in Victoria that has had no bat fatalities from heat-stress events. As the southeast continues to simultaneously heal from the ravages of the 2019–2020 summer bushfires and brace itself for future destructive weather events, ousting the bats from Colac seems especially cruel. Virgo says, “Colac is the safest place for bats.”</p>\n      ","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 02 Apr 2021 20:43:00 +0000","feedId":51,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"be8e69ec5fa9912baf3fe816921c02ce","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Bonnie Nicol","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/81523/image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn39@2020_2/2021/04/03/04-49-41-982_b720275a6011f7e1.webp","https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/81503/image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn63@2020_5/2021/04/03/04-49-42-840_e66dd5416031450c.webp","https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/81524/image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn99@2020_3/2021/04/03/04-49-43-391_e12fc92b4c0ee280.webp","https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/81494/image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn76@2020_4/2021/04/03/04-49-42-879_ad53686d0503aa86.webp","https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/81526/image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn8@2020_4/2021/04/03/04-49-43-438_8a84d9af90be6fcc.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617425381048},{"createdTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:41","updatedTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:41","title":"The Risks and Rewards of the Remarkable Desert Truffle","link":"https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/what-are-desert-truffles","description":"\n        <p>In good years, fall and winter thunderstorms drench the deserts east of the Mediterranean.

For some inhabitants of these deserts, the truffles are worth the risk.</p>\n<p>Scientists who study desert truffles, meanwhile, describe them as fascinating and <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25164975\">“mysterious.”</a> Over the last two or so decades, they have tested ancient wisdom about this largely underappreciated specimen, developing theories about its remarkable ability to adapt and thrive in some of Earth’s driest places.</p>\n<figure class=\"article-image-full-width contains-caption \"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/81540/image.jpg\" alt=\"article-image\" width=\"auto\" data-kind=\"article-image\" /></figure>\n<hr class=\"baseline-grid-hr\" />\n<p>Gather a bounty of desert truffles, haul them to market, and they typically bring in anywhere from <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/world/middleeast/la-fg-col1-iraq-truffles-20190307-story.html\">$3</a> to <a href=\"https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/biz/archives/2018/03/18/2003689496\">$30</a> a pound in Iraq and Kuwait. In Saudi Arabia, these revered fungi reportedly fetch at least <a href=\"https://www.arabnews.com/node/1807331/saudi-arabia\">$84 per pound.</a></p>\n<p>Known as <em>kama</em> in Arabic, desert truffles are so popular that Kuwait has a <a href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/foods/desert-truffles\">seasonal market</a> dedicated wholly to them, and in Iraq, springtime markets exclusively for truffles pop up <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/world/middleeast/la-fg-col1-iraq-truffles-20190307-story.html\">in the southern part of the country</a>.</p>\n<p>These days, desert truffles at such markets are often imported from elsewhere in the region—Iran, Saudia Arabia, Libya, Morocco—given the dangers of procuring them locally. A little over two years ago, unidentified gunmen in Iraq’s Anbar Province <a href=\"https://www.kurdistan24.net/en/news/cf2c00c8-b19d-46b3-97a6-72e446c993fa\">kidnapped a dozen foragers</a>. Just a few weeks earlier, Islamic State militants<a href=\"https://www.kurdistan24.net/en/news/f3181f9c-4071-4ade-9112-78f424abe8db\"> had kidnapped and killed</a> three brothers who were reportedly searching for desert truffles.</p>\n<p>There are other horrors, like landmines left from the 1991 Gulf War. “A while ago, someone died,” Mohsen Farhan, who forages for truffles with his family in the Iraqi desert, recently<a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2021/3/17/the-truffle-hunters-of-iraq\"> told Reuters</a>.</p>\n<figure class=\"article-image-full-width contains-caption \"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/81542/image.jpg\" alt=\"article-image\" width=\"auto\" data-kind=\"article-image\" /></figure>\n<p>Six or seven years ago, a Syrian man was collecting truffles in a gorge in northern Syria, in an area where families used to picnic. He saw a body stuck on a ledge, he<a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/05/04/abyss#_ftn31\"> told human rights investigators</a>, who determined the gorge was being used to dump bodies.</p>\n<p>For some, the dangers are too great. In 2017, Ibrahim Hussein and his family, who used to camp out in the eastern Syrian desert every spring to hunt for truffles, gave up, concerned about U.S. drones and ISIS sleeper cells, he<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/syrias-war-jolts-a-beloved-tradition-gathering-desert-truffles-1524916800\"> told the <em>Wall Street Journal</em></a>.</p>\n<p>But these hardships are simply the latest chapter in humans’ long relationship with desert truffles, which began millenia ago: Archaeologists have <a href=\"http://www.anbg.gov.au/fungi/case-studies/desert-truffles.html\">found</a> mention of desert truffles in cuneiform on clay tablets unearthed at an excavation of a 4,000-year-old Amorite site in eastern Syria. The food from God described in Exodus as <a href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/is-manna-real\">“manna”</a> might, some scientists have argued, <a href=\"http://botit.botany.wisc.edu/toms_fungi/manna.html\">be desert truffles</a>.</p>\n<p>Despite its esteemed history, the desert truffle remains underappreciated outside the region. It has often been dismissed by those who prefer their truffles European, but that is their oversight, because a desert truffle is not supposed to be a European one, overwhelmingly pungent and heart-stoppingly expensive. Rather, it’s a nourishing seasonal staple that is as understated as it looks (plenty of people<a href=\"http://botit.botany.wisc.edu/toms_fungi/manna.html\"> have mistaken truffles for rocks</a>).</p>\n<figure class=\"article-image-full-width contains-caption \"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/81536/image.jpg\" alt=\"article-image\" width=\"auto\" data-kind=\"article-image\" /></figure>\n<p>Desert truffles in one genus, <em>Terfezia</em>, come in all shades of brown, even black, and are slightly softer than a potato. In the other, <em>Tirmania</em>, the truffles are white and have a mushroom-like texture. Their taste is said to be subtle but <a href=\"https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/biz/archives/2018/03/18/2003689496\">distinct</a>, like mushrooms but meatier, and they can carry flavors from whichever aromatics and spices they are cooked alongside. A single desert truffle clocks in<a href=\"https://www.fungimag.com/Truffle-Issue-08-articles/desert-truffles.pdf\"> between one ounce and ten</a>, sometimes with multiple lobes separated by creases full of sand.</p>\n<p>After a day’s work, a forager might roast them over coals. Urban connoisseurs might boil or fry them in butter, or with chopped onions and a dash of turmeric, or scramble them with eggs to put in a pita sandwich. Some grill them, kabob style, between sizzling hunks of animal fat. Another popular option is cooking them with camel’s milk <a href=\"http://botit.botany.wisc.edu/toms_fungi/recipes.html\">to make soup</a>.</p>\n<hr class=\"baseline-grid-hr\" />\n<p>Varda Kagan-Zur, a professor at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in Israel (she’s retired from teaching but still involved in research), remembers her first encounter with desert truffles. It was around 1983, a few years after she’d earned her PhD in plant physiology. At a market in Beersheva, she noticed Bedouin selling something that resembled European truffles.</p>\n<p>“But when I started to read about them [desert truffles], I learned that they were inferior,” she recalls. That characterization, she came to realize, was because her information came from European sources, where truffles were primarily used as a condiment—a few shavings are all a dish needs. Yet she could see that locals valued them highly. She began to study them.</p>\n<figure class=\"article-image-full-width contains-caption \"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/81537/image.jpg\" alt=\"article-image\" width=\"auto\" data-kind=\"article-image\" /></figure>\n<p>Today, mycologists study desert truffles all over the world. Their<a href=\"https://www.fungimag.com/Truffle-Issue-08-articles/desert-truffles.pdf\"> range</a> includes not just the Middle East but also arid and semi-arid lands in North Africa, the Kalahari Desert, southern Europe, eastern Europe, Australia, China, and even North America.</p>\n<p>“There is a lot of interest in desert truffles,” says Kagan-Zur. Some people see them as a potential crop that could thrive in a changing climate. For others, the desert truffle holds culinary intrigue.</p>\n<p>As for scientists, “we have accumulated a lot of knowledge, but not enough,” on both a scientific and practical level, Kagan-Zur says. Cultivating desert truffles <a href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/desert-truffles\">remains a challenge</a>, and many scientific papers about <em>Tirmania </em>or <em>Terfezia</em> lament something along the lines of <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344947088_Agrobacterium_tumefaciens-Mediated_Genetic_Transformation_of_the_Ect-endomycorrhizal_Fungus_Terfezia_boudieri\">“the lack of basic knowledge of their biology at all levels.”</a></p>\n<p>Desert truffles typically grow in conjunction with the shrubs and annuals of the genus <em>Helianthemum</em>, or the rock rose. Their thin fungal filaments—collectively known as the <em>mycelium</em>, individually as <em>hyphae</em>—become intertwined with the plant’s roots, <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299679578_Benefits_Conferred_on_Plants\">sharing nutrients</a> from the soil, likely in exchange <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-40096-4_6\">for sugar from the plants</a>.</p>\n<figure class=\"article-image-full-width contains-caption \"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/81541/image.jpg\" alt=\"article-image\" width=\"auto\" data-kind=\"article-image\" /></figure>\n<p>Mycologists don’t know precisely how desert truffles have adapted to sandy surroundings with minimal rain. But one possibility is the unusual ways their hyphae interact with the root cells of their host plants. Some fungi are endomycorrhizal, meaning that their hyphae are practically embedded in cells. Others are ectomycorrhizal, staying outside cell walls.</p>\n<p>Desert truffles, it turns out, <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344947088_Agrobacterium_tumefaciens-Mediated_Genetic_Transformation_of_the_Ect-endomycorrhizal_Fungus_Terfezia_boudieri\">can be both</a>.</p>\n<p>Research suggests that the relationship the truffles develop with their hosts depends on the weather, according to Kagan-Zur. After a dry summer, fungal filaments tend to penetrate a host’s root cells in typical endomycorrhizal fashion. But when rains arrive, the hyphae pull back.</p>\n<p>“It does seem to have a connection with weather conditions, but no one has shown the sequence very definitely,” Kagan-Zur cautions. “We don’t have any proof.”</p>\n<figure class=\"article-image-full-width contains-caption \"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/81539/image.jpg\" alt=\"article-image\" width=\"auto\" data-kind=\"article-image\" /></figure>\n<p>What scientists are more confident about is that the timing of rain is <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25164975/\">as important as quantity for truffle development</a>. If the rains arrive too late, the host plant will not establish itself well, and neither will the mushroom.</p>\n<p>Another curiosity is the relationship between lightning and truffle formation.</p>\n<p>“The stories go that years with lots of storms, thunder, lightning, will be good years for truffles,” Kagan-Zur says. Somehow, the same legends that have developed across the eastern Mediterranean can also be found as far away as present-day Botswana, in the Kalahari desert. Their independent arisal suggests an element of truth to those stories.</p>\n<p>Just because they haven’t been verified, Kagan-Zur says, doesn’t mean they’re untrue.</p>\n
