Naturally, there&#8217;s been a lot of arguments online in the past few years about which <em>Star Wars</em> flick is the worst, in part due to extremely mixed receptions to both <em><strong>The Last Jedi</strong></em> and <em><strong>The Rise of Skywalker</strong></em>. So we figured it might be fun to issue a survey and ask a bunch of people which <em>Star Wars</em> movie was the absolute worst. Everybody and their mother has made some kind of <em>Star Wars </em>ranking, but we&#8217;re here to give you an unofficial group selection.</p>\n<p>The results weren&#8217;t quite what I expected, given the amount of online hatred I&#8217;ve seen directed toward <em>The Last Jedi. </em>Thankfully, it appears that the people surveyed agree with me (<a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/star-wars-movies-ranked/\">and quite a few of the rest of the /Film crew</a>) and rank <em><strong>Attack of the Clones </strong></em>as the worst <em>Star Wars </em>movie.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-683084\"></span></p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-683096 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/worststarwar-700x422.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"422\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/worststarwar-700x422.png 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/worststarwar-360x217.png 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/worststarwar-768x463.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<h2>By the Numbers</h2>\n<p>Okay, so this isn&#8217;t the definitive worst <em>Star Wars</em> decision, but it does represent the responses of 611 Americans responding on Survey Monkey! 600-ish people isn&#8217;t a huge survey sample, but maybe it&#8217;s enough data to give us an idea of what the average American movie-goer might think. Maybe. I don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;m just extrapolating here. Probably not. I&#8217;m not a scientist. Go away. Also, it&#8217;s also worth noting that neither <em><strong>Rogue One: A Star Wars Story </strong></em>or <em><strong>Solo: A Star Wars Story</strong></em><em> </em>were included, only the nine-film Skywalker saga. <em><strong>The Empire Strikes Back</strong></em><em> </em>also wasn&#8217;t included, because no one in their right mind would ever call that the worst <em>Star Wars </em>(except maybe Randall from <em><strong>Clerks</strong></em>).</p>\n<p>Without further ado, here are the survey&#8217;s rankings of the worst <em>Star Wars</em> movie according to a bunch of random strangers on the internet:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Attack of the Clones 24.22%</li>\n<li>The Phantom Menace 19.15%</li>\n<li>The Rise of Skywalker 13.75%</li>\n<li>The Last Jedi 11.95%</li>\n<li>A New Hope 11.62%</li>\n<li>Revenge of the Sith 11.13%</li>\n<li>Force Awakens 8.18%</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-331214 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-force-awakens-novelization-2-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-force-awakens-novelization-2.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-force-awakens-novelization-2-360x154.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-force-awakens-novelization-2-435x186.jpg 435w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<h2>Breaking it Down</h2>\n<p><em>Attack of the Clones </em>really runs away with the worst <em>Star Wars </em>movie title here, beating out <em><strong>The Phantom Menace </strong></em>by almost 5%. The second film in the prequel trilogy,<em> Attack of the Clones </em>is a love story with zero chemistry and a political drama with zero intrigue. There are moments here and there that work within the greater <em>Star Wars</em> story, but overall, it&#8217;s just kind of boring. Most of the movie is spent either trying to develop a romance between Amidala (<strong>Natalie Portman</strong>) and Anakin (<strong>Hayden Christensen</strong>) that feels kind of icky since Anakin was just a kid in the previous movie, while Amidala was already an adult. The rest is a bunch of senate meetings, with occasional bursts of action.</p>\n<p><em>The Phantom Menace</em> coming in second is no surprise. It was the first <em>Star Wars </em>movie in a decade and a half, and expectations were high. Instead, many fans were disappointed by the first prequel&#8217;s zany humor and decidedly younger target audience. <em>The Phantom Menace</em> does have that incredible climactic lightsaber battle, which edges it out over the absolute blandness of <em>Attack of the Clones</em>.</p>\n<p>The next two are really no surprise, and often come up in conversation around one another. <strong>J.J. Abrams</strong>&#8216; <em>The Rise of Skywalker</em> and <strong>Rian Johnson</strong>&#8216;s <em>The Last Jedi</em> are both highly contentious among <em>Star Wars </em>fans. Many were frustrated by <em>The Last Jedi</em>&#8216;s decision to turn series hero Luke Skywalker (<strong>Mark Hamill</strong>) into a bitter recluse. They also felt Johnson&#8217;s desire to focus on thematics and meta-context instead of delivery a straightforward <em>Star Wars</em> adventure didn&#8217;t fit in with the series so far, though other fans disagreed. <em>The Rise of Skywalker</em> was a quick about-face on the part of Disney and Lucasfilm, bringing back old fan favorites from the original trilogy and attempting to &#8220;fix&#8221; what fans didn&#8217;t like about <em>The Last Jedi</em>. Both movies have their fans and detractors, and those feelings are pretty intense.</p>\n<p>The biggest surprise here comes from <strong><em>A New Hope</em></strong> being ranked as worse than <em><strong>Revenge of the Sith</strong></em>, which features the goofiest &#8220;No!&#8221; in all of cinema, and <strong><em>The Force Awakens</em></strong>, which is just <em>A New Hope</em> with a fresh coat of paint. It&#8217;s hard to imagine anyone hating on the original <em>Star Wars</em> film, the one that started it all, but clearly some people prefer the updated version. For some reason. What gives, random survey responders?</p>\n<p>Maybe they can&#8217;t rate <em>The Force Awakens</em> as the worst because it&#8217;s relatively forgettable in the grand scheme. It&#8217;s hard to find fault with something you can&#8217;t remember.</p>\n<p>For what it&#8217;s worth, I absolutely agree that <em>Attack of the Clones </em>is the biggest stinker in the <em>Star Wars</em> franchise, but <em>A New Hope</em> ranking at all feels blasphemous.

You&#8217;d be forgiven for assuming that a movie like that would be some sort of goofy, indie <em>John Wick </em>knock-off. You&#8217;d also be forgiven for assuming that Cage, playing the man searching for his pilfered porcine pal, goes over the top. After all, Cage has become legendary for becoming unhinged on screen. And he&#8217;s become notorious for appearing in a lot of junk, too.</p>\n<p>But within moments of starting, <em>Pig</em> demands you leave all those assumptions behind you. Because <em>Pig</em> is not the movie you think it is. It&#8217;s something far more beautiful, and far more painful. It is an existential meditation on the search for <em>something. Anything</em>. A kind of cosmic loneliness envelopes this film. It&#8217;s extraordinary.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-683194\"></span></p>\n<p>Cage is Rob, a mysterious, grizzled man who lives out in the wilderness with only his truffle-hunting pig for company. By day, Rob and the pig take to the woods in search of fancy fungi. By night, they return to a ramshackle cabin, where the pig has its own little bed mere inches away from Rob&#8217;s. The only real human contact Rob has is with Amir (<strong>Alex Wolff</strong>), a hotshot trying to make a name for himself in the Portland restaurant scene. Amir stops by in his cool car on Thusdays to purchase Rob&#8217;s truffles.</p>\n<p>Rob&#8217;s life is simple, quiet. Watching him is like watching part of the scenery – as if the character is blending into the nature he inhabits. These early moments have an earthy quality that teases our scenes; we can smell the woods, the dirt, the small little private world Rob inhabits. But this tranquility will not last. Late one night, a pair of drug addicts burst into Rob&#8217;s home, knock him out, and steal his pig. It&#8217;s a harrowing, horrifying scene, made all the more disturbing by the human-like screams emitting from the kidnapped pig. It breaks your heart.</p>\n<p>Here is where you might think the movie turns into <em>John Wick But With a Pig Instead of a Dog</em>. &#8220;Ah-ha!&#8221; you might say after the big, brutal pig snatching scene. &#8220;Now Nic Cage is going to go <em>crazy</em> and enact bloody revenge against those who wronged him!&#8221; But remember: <em>Pig</em> is not the movie you think it is. Bloody and bruised, Rob picks himself up and sets out to find his pig, dragging Amir along with him. Rob has no means of transportation, so Amir becomes his reluctant chauffeur.</p>\n<p>As Rob and Amir search for the pig, Rob&#8217;s backstory comes clearer into focus. We learn he was once a renowned chef, but that he&#8217;s been off the grid for 15 years. That time away hasn&#8217;t diminished his celebrity, though. If anything, it&#8217;s made it stronger. When Rob enters a restaurant and the people working there realize who he is, they&#8217;re awed, as if they&#8217;re having some sort of religious experience. As if Rob was the Pope and they were the faithful ready to bury their faces in his vestments.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/pig-movie.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-683209\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/pig-movie-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/pig-movie-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/pig-movie-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/pig-movie-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/pig-movie.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Writer-director Sarnoski does a fair amount of subtle world-building here. Rob and Amir are not moving through the restaurant scene as you or I would. They&#8217;re instead traveling through backrooms and places where regular customers would not be welcome. A surreal quality unfolds here, as if we&#8217;re not entirely sure if what we&#8217;re witnessing is meant to be taken seriously, or if it&#8217;s supposed to be some heightened, fantasized underground world. It&#8217;s a world where things can get violent, and nasty. Where secret chef fight clubs take place in basements and dank rooms that have never experienced a single sliver of sunlight.</p>\n<p>Rob moves through this world seeming both at ease and an outsider. He knows he&#8217;s a legend; he knows he is a chef unlike any other. But he also wants to be left alone. Were it not for his pig, he would not be bothering with this world again. Cage plays all of this with a subtle grace that is bound to shock folks who have come to (wrongly) believe that the actor plays everything big and loud. Yes, Cage can go coo-coo sometimes – there&#8217;s no arguing against that. Yet there is so much more to the actor&#8217;s talents that so many people willingly overlook. They want Cage to be a walking meme, and Cage seems willing to indulge this – up to a point. But he&#8217;s also capable of true nuance, and beauty. He&#8217;s one of our most fascinating working actors, and here he delivers one of the best performances of his entire career. A soulful, introspective, melancholy performance that is so strong, so present, that it carries real weight.</p>\n<p>Wolff makes for a great companion on this journey. His twitchy, blustery character is constantly acting bigger than he really is, and just as we learn more about Rob as the story unfolds, we also learn more about Amir, and his background involving a demanding, powerful father, played by <strong>Adam Arkin</strong>, who shows up late in the film and makes quite an impression, making sure every single second of his small screentime counts.</p>\n<p>Rob is a lost soul, and as we all are in our own little ways. He&#8217;s not just searching for his pig, he&#8217;s also searching for some sort of truth, some sort of beauty. His cooking is his art, and it&#8217;s something perhaps too pure to share with the world regularly. Perhaps that&#8217;s why he dropped off the face of the earth and hid his gifts away. Now, as he continues his search, he once again finds himself cooking for others. They bite into Rob&#8217;s food and unlock memories and dreams long since tucked away and lost. <em>Pig</em> is a lot like Rob&#8217;s food, awakening something within us. We come away changed, tears in our eyes. <em>Pig</em> is not the movie you think it is.</p>\n<p><strong>/Film Rating: 9 out of 10</strong></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/pig-review/\">&#8216;Pig&#8217; Review: Nicolas Cage Gives One of His Best Performances in This Haunting Drama</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=3DtkZRQxHVE:c-Puhb62FtI:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=3DtkZRQxHVE:c-Puhb62FtI:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=3DtkZRQxHVE:c-Puhb62FtI:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=3DtkZRQxHVE:c-Puhb62FtI:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=3DtkZRQxHVE:c-Puhb62FtI:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=3DtkZRQxHVE:c-Puhb62FtI:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/3DtkZRQxHVE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 13 Jul 2021 14:00:34 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Pig-Review-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"8912556c32a967bcf7050625fef90dba","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn28@2020_1/2021/07/13/17-21-55-346_b799415f07d45439.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":20541,"destBytes":11010,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Pig-Review-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn28@2020_1/2021/07/13/17-21-55-346_b799415f07d45439.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/pig-movie-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn39@2020_3/2021/07/13/17-22-14-540_9c6987b0ed67cc2c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn76@2020_5/2021/07/13/17-22-14-413_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=3DtkZRQxHVE:c-Puhb62FtI:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn80@2020_3/2021/07/13/17-22-14-506_b257eef41c6e799d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn3@2020_1/2021/07/13/17-22-14-788_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=3DtkZRQxHVE:c-Puhb62FtI:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn47@2020_1/2021/07/13/17-22-14-142_429761d4264ab873.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/3DtkZRQxHVE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn56@2020_3/2021/07/13/17-22-13-957_982bde3323badcdd.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1626196915177},{"createdTime":"2021-07-14 01:21:55","updatedTime":"2021-07-14 01:21:55","title":"‘Spriggan’ Trailer: Netflix’s Sci-Fi Action Anime Gets Delayed to 2022","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=683192","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-683214 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Spriggan-Teaser-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Spriggan-Teaser-700x300.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Spriggan-Teaser-360x154.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Spriggan-Teaser-768x329.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Netflix</strong> <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/netflix-anime-deals/\">continues to expand</a> its slate of original anime films and TV shows, but viewers will have to wait a little while longer before they see <em><strong>Spriggan</strong></em>.

It was originally serialized from 1989 to 1996 in Shogakukan&#8217;s <em>Weekly Shonen Sunday </em>magazine (which, for some reason, publishes on Wednesday, not Sunday). Anime was beginning to find more of a Western audience with movies like <em>Akira</em> and <em>Ghost in the Shell, </em>and <em>Spriggan</em> soon capitalized on this with its own film adaptation, which hit theaters in Japan in 1998 and eventually made its way stateside in 2001.</p>\n<p>Now, a new TV anime adaptation is headed to Netflix. The first teaser for <em>Spriggan</em>, which debuted back in October 2020, ended with the words &#8220;coming 2021.&#8221; This new teaser changes that to &#8220;coming 2022.&#8221;</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-683192\"></span></p>\n<h2>Spriggan Official Teaser Trailers</h2>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PJnbniBJrvQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Bombastic music, crackling energy, agents in armored muscle suits, and the secrets of ancient civilizations are all on display in these trailers. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spriggan\">&#8220;Spriggan&#8221;</a> is actually a word derived from a creature in Cornish folklore. The official synopsis for <em>Spriggan</em> describes the Netflix series in these terms:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"auto\">This story depicts the adventures of Yu Ominae, a young man who serves as a “Spriggan,” a special agent of the ARCAM corporation, an organization established to seal away the relics of an ancient civilization.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"auto\">In case you missed it, the first teaser reveals more details of the mythological backstory behind <em>Spriggan</em>:</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XyM77kuOCxQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">The official logline also goes into greater depth about what Netflix subscribers can expect to see next year:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"auto\">A great civilization once existed on this Earth. Possessing knowledge and scientific prowess far exceeding that of modern man, the relics of this ancient civilization remain hidden across this world even now. As high-speed communications networks cover the globe and the peering eyes of satellites are able to expose all secrets, the armies of great nations clash as they seek to uncover and research these artifacts, which possess an unfathomable “power.” A member of this ancient civilization carved a message into a plate: “Protect our legacy from evildoers.” Taking this message to heart, one organization aims to seal away this ancient civilization for good. The elite secret agents of this organization are known as&#8230; Spriggans.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"auto\"><em>Spriggan</em> is directed by <strong>Hiroshi Kobayashi</strong> and adapted for the screen by writer <strong>Hiroshi Seko</strong>. <strong>Shuhei Handa</strong> acts as the supervising animation director and is handling the character design. The series features the voices of <strong>Chiaki Kobayashi</strong>, <strong>Youhei Azakami</strong>, <strong>Kenji Hamada</strong>, and <strong>Mariya Ise</strong>.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Expect to see <em>Spriggan</em> hit Netflix sometime in <strong>2022</strong>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/spriggan-trailer-release-date/\">&#8216;Spriggan&#8217; Trailer: Netflix&#8217;s Sci-Fi Action Anime Gets Delayed to 2022</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=kwgDsQYfnTM:hWIuvF_uslM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=kwgDsQYfnTM:hWIuvF_uslM:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=kwgDsQYfnTM:hWIuvF_uslM:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=kwgDsQYfnTM:hWIuvF_uslM:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=kwgDsQYfnTM:hWIuvF_uslM:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=kwgDsQYfnTM:hWIuvF_uslM:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/kwgDsQYfnTM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 13 Jul 2021 12:38:09 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Spriggan-Teaser-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"eb680d6736be41cad66ffcdc665aa0a8","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn33@2020_3/2021/07/13/17-22-03-529_2d216d414777105e.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":31526,"destBytes":20516,"author":"Joshua Meyer","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Spriggan-Teaser-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn33@2020_3/2021/07/13/17-22-03-529_2d216d414777105e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn76@2020_5/2021/07/13/17-22-14-413_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=kwgDsQYfnTM:hWIuvF_uslM:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn32@2020_1/2021/07/13/17-22-14-139_5000d989f165c6c8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn3@2020_1/2021/07/13/17-22-14-788_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=kwgDsQYfnTM:hWIuvF_uslM:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn56@2020_1/2021/07/13/17-22-14-549_a8ea9dfd6199f59b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/kwgDsQYfnTM":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn47@2020_1/2021/07/13/17-22-14-309_bfc760d0a4a8c744.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1626196915177},{"createdTime":"2021-07-14 01:21:55","updatedTime":"2021-07-14 01:21:55","title":"‘The Suicide Squad’ Featurette on RED Cameras is Full of New Footage From James Gunn’s Supervillain Film","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=683297","description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/The-Suicide-Squad-Featurette-Red-Cameras.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-683316\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/The-Suicide-Squad-Featurette-Red-Cameras-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"The Suicide Squad Featurette Red Cameras\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/The-Suicide-Squad-Featurette-Red-Cameras-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/The-Suicide-Squad-Featurette-Red-Cameras-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/The-Suicide-Squad-Featurette-Red-Cameras-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/The-Suicide-Squad-Featurette-Red-Cameras.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Hey, do you want to watch some brand-spankin&#8217; new footage from <strong><em>The Suicide Squad</em></strong>?

In a new featurette, director<strong> James Gunn</strong> talks about the RED cameras he used to shoot the film – including &#8220;a dynamic shooting style that&#8230;wasn’t possible before the creation of RED’s latest camera innovations.&#8221; And while all of this RED talk kind of makes this video feel like an ad, you&#8217;re still getting some new <em>Suicide Squad</em> footage, so that has to count for something.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-683297\"></span></p>\n<h2><strong>The Suicide Squad Featurette </strong></h2>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/oss4zPd8bIk?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p><em>The Suicide Squad</em> was filmed entirely with IMAX-certified RED cameras – a process that James Gunn speaks highly of. &#8220;The way that movie is shot is the way I’ve wanted to shoot every movie but have not been able to until now,&#8221; Gunn says in the video above. &#8220;Nearly every shot in this movie is on the move,” says Gunn, “and not only that but we wanted to get up close and move around and between people. The tech has advanced to match what I see with my mind.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Cinematographer<strong> Henry Braham</strong> and his team &#8220;made customized gyrostabilized mounts to enable genuinely stabilized hand-held movement.&#8221; Cameras used included the Ranger Monstro and the Komodo, which was still in prototype at the time. &#8220;Komodo is a great little camera,&#8221; Braham says. &#8220;There are shots in the movie we could only get with something that small that comes with high-res imagery.&#8221; Braham used Leica M-System glass to keep &#8220;image quality and maneuverability in mind.&#8221; “</p>\n<p>&#8220;From the beginning, one of the main goals was to keep it alive, keep it visceral, keep it real; one of the pathways to do that is the way to use the camera,&#8221; Gunn says, adding: &#8220;Nearly every shot in this movie is moving&#8230;and not only is it moving, but we want to get in really close, and between people, and you just can&#8217;t do that with a bulky camera.&#8221; Gunn also says that thanks to the cameras, not only is he getting exactly what he envisioned, he&#8217;s getting <em>better</em> than what he envisioned, adding that the end result was the most enjoyable process he&#8217;s ever had making a film.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Suicide-Squad-Polka-Dot-Man.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-680331\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Suicide-Squad-Polka-Dot-Man-700x300.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Suicide-Squad-Polka-Dot-Man.png 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Suicide-Squad-Polka-Dot-Man-360x154.png 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<h2><strong>The Suicide Squad</strong></h2>\n<p>In <em>The Suicide Squad</em>, Amanda Waller assembles &#8220;a collection of cons, including Bloodsport, Peacemaker, Captain Boomerang, Ratcatcher 2, Savant, King Shark, Blackguard, Javelin and everyone’s favorite psycho, Harley Quinn. Then arm them heavily and drop them (literally) on the remote, enemy-infused island of Corto Maltese. Trekking through a jungle teeming with militant adversaries and guerrilla forces at every turn, the Squad is on a search-and-destroy mission with only Colonel Rick Flag on the ground to make them behave…and Amanda Waller’s government techies in their ears, tracking their every movement. And as always, one wrong move and they’re dead (whether at the hands of their opponents, a teammate, or Waller herself).

But promising new anime filmmakers are a dime a dozen, and it takes more than one masterpiece to have one name&#8217;s bandied around as the &#8220;next Hayao Miyazaki.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Enter <em>Summer Wars</em>, Hosoda&#8217;s impossibly imaginative digital adventure, which takes all of the filmmaker&#8217;s sleek sci-fi chops that he honed during his time as an animator on <em>Digimon</em> (later making his feature directorial debut with <em>Digimon: The Movie</em>) and combines them with the delicate slice-of-life sensibilities that he had tested out with <em>The Girl Who Leapt Through Time</em>. It&#8217;s hard to describe <em>Summer Wars</em> without it sounding like the weirdest and most <em>anime</em> movie out there, but Hosoda strikes an incredible balance between the wildly differing tones — and genres — of the movie. At first, <em>Summer Wars</em> unfolds like a serene, lazy slice-of-life movie, set in a countryside house where nothing happens outside of a crowded family reunion, where all kinds of outrageous characters vie for the attention of our quiet protagonist. But suddenly, Hosoda shifts gears, and <em>Summer Wars</em> transforms into an action-packed adventure that threatens to overwhelm your senses. It&#8217;s like watching a beaten-up vintage buggy morph into a giant multi-colored mech — and it&#8217;s awesome.</p>\n<p>The virtual-reality scenes are some of the most breathtaking depictions of the digital world that have been rendered to the screen — in both the animated and live-action realm. It&#8217;s exciting, and colorful, and amorphous, with users taking on all kinds of non-human avatars that look like your <em>Alice in Wonderland </em>dreams come to life. And as overwhelming as the imagery can be, it&#8217;s 10 times more watchable than the gray, washed-out depictions of the digital world that Hollywood seems so fond of. Couple that with the warm, pastel tones of the real world, and <em>Summer Wars</em> is a veritable visual feast.</p>\n<p>But let me walk back the &#8220;next Hayao Miyazaki&#8221; label, because I find it to be a reductive way to try to assess anime filmmakers, who can offer so much more than aping the anime titan. Hosoda himself had bucked the Ghibli influence, having been attached at one point to direct the studio&#8217;s <em>Howl&#8217;s Moving Castle</em> before exiting the project over creative differences. Hosoda may operate in some of the same territory as Miyazaki — the pastoral imagery of <em>Summer Wars</em> and the spirit-world locales of his later films like <em>The Boy and the Beast</em> would draw the most comparisons — but he is a very different filmmaker. (And even more different than the other anime auteur who also gets frequently compared to Miyazaki, <em>Your Name</em>&#8216;s <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/weathering-with-you-review/\">Makoto Shinkai</a>.)</p>\n<p>There is an&#8230;ordinariness to Hosoda&#8217;s works, an earthy warmth that surpasses even that of the cosmically-minded Shinkai and the idyllic Miyazaki. Despite the fantastical nature of many of Hosoda&#8217;s films, they feel lived-in, in a way that other anime films can&#8217;t achieve. There&#8217;s a complexity, a messiness to his characters and worlds that make Hosoda more than just the &#8220;next Miyazaki.&#8221; And you can see the beginnings of that in <em>Summer Wars</em>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-daily-stream-summer-wars/\">The Daily Stream: &#8216;Summer Wars&#8217; Signaled the Arrival of a New Anime Auteur, But Mamoru Hosoda is More Than &#8220;The Next Miyazaki&#8221;</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=UC_s6s8GVnY:TJvdsQPDsLs:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=UC_s6s8GVnY:TJvdsQPDsLs:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=UC_s6s8GVnY:TJvdsQPDsLs:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=UC_s6s8GVnY:TJvdsQPDsLs:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=UC_s6s8GVnY:TJvdsQPDsLs:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=UC_s6s8GVnY:TJvdsQPDsLs:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/UC_s6s8GVnY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 13 Jul 2021 15:44:44 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/summer-wars-e1626182150948-700x299.jpeg","linkMd5":"1c30c5992a472bab6ce63d325258dbfe","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn30@2020_4/2021/07/13/17-22-05-446_0ff609d2dc533744.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":299,"sourceBytes":58941,"destBytes":45380,"author":"Hoai-Tran Bui","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/summer-wars-e1626182150948-700x299.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn30@2020_4/2021/07/13/17-22-05-446_0ff609d2dc533744.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn76@2020_5/2021/07/13/17-22-14-413_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=UC_s6s8GVnY:TJvdsQPDsLs:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn59@2020_5/2021/07/13/17-22-13-993_f98c61942e3bb90f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn3@2020_1/2021/07/13/17-22-14-788_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=UC_s6s8GVnY:TJvdsQPDsLs:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn76@2020_1/2021/07/13/17-22-14-658_852caada28703621.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/UC_s6s8GVnY":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn94@2020_6/2021/07/13/17-22-13-925_7a99c13583cc8db7.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1626196915177},{"createdTime":"2021-07-14 01:21:55","updatedTime":"2021-07-14 01:21:55","title":"Richard E.

Grant</strong>? In recent years, the esteemed thespian has shown up in <em>Game of Thrones</em> as a hilariously snobbish actor in a traveling play, as &#8220;Shiver&#8221; in Disney&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/nutcracker-and-the-four-realms-review/\">bizarrely compelling <em>The Nutcracker and the Four Realms</em></a> (a movie and a performance than I&#8217;m 50% sure I must have hallucinated), and lived out his dream as a First Order officer in <em>The Rise of Skywalker</em>. It was an utter coup for Marvel to grab him for their ongoing <em><strong>Loki</strong></em> series and Grant has some tongue-in-cheek ideas about where to take things next.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-683263\"></span></p>\n<h2>Let Richard E. Grant Do Whatever He Wants</h2>\n<p>Not content to stop at merely putting on those Loki horns in that absurdly perfect outfit, the &#8220;Classic Loki&#8221; actor outlines his very serious conditions for coming back to play the character in some future project, especially since (spoiler alert) nobody ever really stays dead in these things anyway. In an interview with <a href=\"https://ew.com/tv/richard-e-grant-loki-interview/\">Entertainment Weekly</a>, Grant offered a pitch for a Classic Loki series:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;If I had a muscle suit, most certainly. I was denied that. I saw the costume design, and I was very familiar with Jack Kirby&#8217;s original illustrations from the &#8217;60s, so I thought, &#8216;Ah, this guy&#8217;s got muscles!&#8217; As I had been born without any, I was finally going to get in a muscle suit. I got to Atlanta [to begin filming], and they said, &#8216;There&#8217;s no muscle suit! You&#8217;re just wearing this!&#8217; I said, &#8216;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/RichardEGrant/status/1412887615204888586\">But I look like Kermit the Frog!</a>&#8216; They said, &#8216;Nope, you&#8217;re not having a muscle suit.&#8217; So I was very, very upset about that. [Laughs] Short-changed!&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-681484\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Alligator-Loki-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"Alligator Loki\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Alligator-Loki.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Alligator-Loki-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<h2>See You Later Alligator</h2>\n<p>So what would a Classic Loki series look like, muscle suit aside? According to Grant, it would involve that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/iamkateherron/status/1412675558484451329\">infamously demanding costar</a>, Alligator Loki:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Alligator Loki was fantastic because in reality, he was three stuffed sofa cushions that had been sewn roughly together to react to. [Laughs] The fact that I was the only person that could understand what he was saying was just fantastic. I think it&#8217;s the perfect segue into having Classic Old Loki and Alligator Loki as a sub-series to go to next.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I am the Doctor Dolittle of the Marvel universe when it comes to speaking to alligators. I speak alligator fluently. Put that in the contract of when I&#8217;m doing a series as Classic Old Loki, with muscles and the alligator. It&#8217;ll have subtitles, so the audience can hear what the alligator is saying, and everyone else is saying, &#8216;What is he saying? What is he talking about?&#8217; That&#8217;ll be the way.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>There probably aren&#8217;t many MCU projects at this point that crowds <em>wouldn&#8217;t</em> turn out in droves to see, but I feel reasonably confident that <em>The Further Adventures of Classic Loki and Alligator Loki</em> would be a smash hit on Disney+, or even as a movie of its own. Hit me up, Marvel. Grant and I will be patiently awaiting your calls.</p>\n<p>Be sure to <a href=\"https://ew.com/tv/richard-e-grant-loki-interview/\">click through for more tidbits</a> from the interview, ranging from Grant&#8217;s torrid romance with costar <strong>Owen Wilson</strong> to the practicality of shooting those CGI-heavy scenes.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/richard-e-grant-classic-loki-spin-off/\">Richard E.

Have they finally lost their spark? Is the Golden Age over and done with? Well, <em>Luca</em> was certainly a <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/luca-review/\">slight-but-sweet little tale</a> and now Pixar&#8217;s latest, <em><strong>Turning Red</strong></em>, is angling to have its own say on the matter as well. Pixar released the first teaser trailer earlier today, which you can check out below.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-683241\"></span></p>\n<h2>Turning Red Teaser Trailer</h2>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pqdHP2dWQ9M?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>Written and directed by <strong>Domee Shi</strong>, best known for her stunning 2018 Oscar-winning short film <em><strong>Bao</strong></em> (which she wrote, directed, and is also credited as story artist) as well as serving in the animation department for <em><strong>Inside Out</strong></em>, <em><strong>The Good Dinosaur</strong></em>, <em><strong>Incredibles 2</strong></em>, and <em><strong>Toy Story 4</strong></em>, <em>Turning Red</em> has the feel of serving as a well-earned promotion for the Pixar veteran.</p>\n<p>The story follows a young teenage girl named Mei Lee (<strong>Rosalie Chiang</strong>) who, in classic Pixar style, transforms into a giant red panda at the slightest hint of excitement. Of course, conflict arises as her overprotective mother Ming (<strong>Sandra Oh</strong>) is constantly hovering over Mei&#8217;s shoulder. As spelled out in the teaser, this premise appears to be a really clever and fun metaphor for the growing pains involved in teenagers struggling to get out from under their stifling parents.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-588291\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/pixaranimation-frontgates-700x312.jpg\" alt=\"A Day in the Life at Pixar Animation\" width=\"700\" height=\"312\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/pixaranimation-frontgates-700x312.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/pixaranimation-frontgates-360x161.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/pixaranimation-frontgates-768x342.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/pixaranimation-frontgates.jpg 888w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<h2>If It Ain&#8217;t Broke&#8230;</h2>\n<p>Like <em>Luca</em> earlier this year or especially something like <em><strong>Coco</strong></em>, outsized (and sometimes very literal) metaphors for such universal, yet culturally-specific concepts tend to be familiar areas that Pixar has excelled at in the past. <em>Turning Red</em> clearly has no shortage of talent supporting this endearingly awkward story and looks set to continue that exciting trend. Based entirely on <em>Bao</em> and its strong ties to Chinese culture, I would certainly not bet against whatever Shi has up her sleeves on this one.</p>\n<p>Honestly, you can count me among the group of dissenters who&#8217;ve been slightly worried that Pixar has somewhat lost its touch in recent years, pivoting to uninspired sequels or prequels and even lacking that special &#8220;something&#8221; in their recent originals, too. Funny how a glimpse of some fun footage can go a long way.</p>\n<p><em>Turning Red</em> is set to bow on <strong>March 11, 2022</strong>. Check out the official synopsis below.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Young actress Rosalie Chiang lends her voice to Mei Lee, a 13-year-old who suddenly ‘poofs’ into a giant red panda when she gets too excited (which is practically ALWAYS). Sandra Oh voices Mei Lee’s protective, if not slightly overbearing mother, Ming, who is never far from her daughter—an unfortunate reality for the teenager.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/turning-red-teaser-trailer/\">&#8216;Turning Red&#8217; Teaser Trailer: Pixar&#8217;s Newest Movie is All About Growing Pains</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=frfefvRpyBE:2qgVlbeIFcI:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=frfefvRpyBE:2qgVlbeIFcI:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=frfefvRpyBE:2qgVlbeIFcI:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=frfefvRpyBE:2qgVlbeIFcI:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=frfefvRpyBE:2qgVlbeIFcI:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=frfefvRpyBE:2qgVlbeIFcI:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/frfefvRpyBE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 13 Jul 2021 13:38:14 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/turning-red-e1626183239528-700x299.jpg","linkMd5":"db0611c62a04b62c60f4ffa26f7ef67f","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn37@2020_3/2021/07/13/17-21-55-335_0aa2070f10392838.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":299,"sourceBytes":25896,"destBytes":14672,"author":"Jeremy Mathai","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/turning-red-e1626183239528-700x299.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn37@2020_3/2021/07/13/17-21-55-335_0aa2070f10392838.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/pixaranimation-frontgates-700x312.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn24@2020_2/2021/07/13/17-22-14-527_a4ddf6951ade17de.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn76@2020_5/2021/07/13/17-22-14-413_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=frfefvRpyBE:2qgVlbeIFcI:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn35@2020_2/2021/07/13/17-22-13-968_4bd93553d4023e6b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn3@2020_1/2021/07/13/17-22-14-788_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=frfefvRpyBE:2qgVlbeIFcI:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn43@2020_4/2021/07/13/17-22-14-677_50ddee86144caf42.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/frfefvRpyBE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn36@2020_4/2021/07/13/17-22-14-373_da586c947ea3827c.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1626196915176},{"createdTime":"2021-07-14 01:21:55","updatedTime":"2021-07-14 01:21:55","title":"The Slashfilmcast is Now The Filmcast – Here’s What You Need to Know","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=682246","description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/thefilmcasthorizontal.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-682257 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/thefilmcasthorizontal-700x299.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"299\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/thefilmcasthorizontal-700x300.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/thefilmcasthorizontal-360x154.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/thefilmcasthorizontal-768x329.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p>14 years ago, /Film editor-in-chief Peter Sciretta called me and made me an offer: &#8220;How would you like to make a film podcast for slashfilm.com?&#8221;</p>\n<p>After thinking about it for six minutes, my co-hosts and I decided to do it. How could we refuse? For me, it was a dream come true. I&#8217;d read sites like /Film since I was in high school and I&#8217;d been making podcasts since people listened to them using iPods with clickwheels on them. To be able to make a podcast about movies that more than 30 people might listen to? Of course I had to take the plunge.</p>\n<p><strong>The Slashfilmcast</strong> has been running for over 13 years now. Being able to create this podcast consistently with Devindra and Jeff (and previously, Adam) has been one of the most enjoyable and rewarding experiences of my life. It&#8217;s outlasted several jobs, moves across the country, and host changes. There are undoubtedly be more changes to come in the future, but one of them happens today: <strong>The Slashfilmcast is spinning off to become our own independent podcast called &#8220;The Filmcast.&#8221;</strong> A few reflections and details follow.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-682246\"></span></p>\n<p>The Slashfilmcast spawned because I wanted to have a conversation with folks about movies that didn&#8217;t end after someone said, &#8220;That was pretty good!&#8221; I loved diving into spoilers with my colleagues and reflecting on the meaning of movies, along with their cultural significance. We also were grateful and honored by all the guests that stopped by to add their voices to the conversation.</p>\n<p>Our first episode received around a thousand downloads. In the time since then, a lot has happened. We&#8217;ve had guests such as Rian Johnson, James Cameron, and Richard Kelly. The podcast has gone on to be downloaded over 50 million times. A community has formed around the show. Listeners have met and even gotten married because they met through the podcast. New podcasts have spawned from the Slashfilmcast. Hosts have met and formed new ventures because of work we&#8217;ve all done together.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s hard to understate how much all this has meant to me personally. As a kid who grew up in a tiny suburb of Boston, watching Hong Kong action movies and dreaming about Hollywood, I got to actually talk with people who make movies (and occasionally, people would actually listen to our conversations)! I got to learn so much more about how movies were made and distributed, and eventually even <a href=\"http://www.theprimaryinstinct.com\">make a movie myself</a>. Perhaps most importantly, I got to meet and become friends with so many wonderful, talented individuals. Many of these connections will last for the rest of my life.</p>\n<p>Since we launched the show, the world of podcasting has exploded. The tools became easier to use and podcasting no longer required an Intel Core 2 Duo desktop computer with a Sound Blaster. Now, anyone with a smartphone can now make and distribute their own podcast. On the other end, well-financed companies are pouring millions of dollars into creating and distributing podcasts about every single conceivable topic, including movies.</p>\n<p>Simultaneously, the movie industry is in a challenging place right now, especially with theaters shutting down in light of all the events of the past year. I obviously can&#8217;t do those events justice in this post, but suffice it to say that with all the other immense tragedy and upheaval that society as a whole was dealing with, I was honestly unsure whether the show would be able to continue.</p>\n<p>But when <a href=\"http://www.patreon.com/filmpodcast\">we launched our Patreon page</a> last fall, our listeners declared clearly and decisively: They want the show to go on. And so, we will continue. We are extremely grateful for their support, and spinning off independently ensures we can do that in the strongest possible way and under circumstances where we can own our own future.</p>\n<p>Alright, here are some FAQs.</p>\n<h2><strong>Whoa, you&#8217;re not the Slashfilmcast anymore? Did you guys have a fight with /Film or something?</strong></h2>\n<p>Not at all! We love all the fine folks at /Film and you should still expect them to appear occasionally in future episodes of the podcast. We&#8217;ve just been talking about why it might make sense to spin off for awhile now and <a href=\"http://patreon.com/filmpodcast\">our recent support from Patrons</a> has shown us that an independent future is viable. So, we&#8217;re making the leap!</p>\n<h2><strong>What else is going to change about the podcast?</strong></h2>\n<p>Other than the name, we don&#8217;t plan to change anything! We&#8217;ll continue to make the same stuff we&#8217;ve always been making with interesting guests from around the internet and the world of film and television. The podcast will continue to come out weekly (with an After Dark several times per month for patrons). That said, you&#8217;ll no longer see updates/content from the podcast on slashfilm.com.</p>\n<h2><strong>What if I&#8217;m already subscribed to the podcast? Do I need to re-subscribe somewhere else?</strong></h2>\n<p>No. If you&#8217;re already subscribed, you&#8217;ll still get episodes in the existing feed like normal. Just note that our name and podcast icon may look a little different in your podcast app.</p>\n<h2><strong>What if I&#8217;m an existing Patron? Will anything change?</strong></h2>\n<p>No, other than the name of the podcast and podcast icon. <a href=\"http://patreon.com/filmpodcast\">Our tiers</a> will stay the same and you&#8217;ll continue to get ad-free/bonus episodes through the existing feeds.</p>\n<h2><strong>Where can I find older episodes of the podcast?</strong></h2>\n<p>The current podcast feed contains the 250-plus most recent episodes of the podcast. There are no immediate plans to make episodes older than that widely available.</p>\n<h2><strong>Cool new logo! Will you guys have any merch?</strong></h2>\n<p>Stay tuned!</p>\n<h2><strong>Yes, but HOW do I stay tuned? Can I follow you guys on Twitter?</strong></h2>\n<p>Yes, find us at <a href=\"http://twitter.com/thefilmcastpod\">@thefilmcastpod</a>. You&#8217;ll also find our new podcast page at <a href=\"http://thefilmcast.com\">thefilmcast.com</a>. Our email address slashfilmcast(AT)gmail(DOT)com will also continue to function for a little while longer, so you are welcome to reach us there.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">***</p>\n<p>In closing, I want to thank all the fine folks at /Film for their support through this process. And I want to thank Peter Sciretta, for giving a kid a chance in the world of online podcasting. It changed everything.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-slashfilmcast-is-now-the-filmcast-heres-what-you-need-to-know/\">The Slashfilmcast is Now The Filmcast – Here&#8217;s What You Need to Know</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=1wyFKvZQ3fE:UExKTHHd3O0:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=1wyFKvZQ3fE:UExKTHHd3O0:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=1wyFKvZQ3fE:UExKTHHd3O0:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=1wyFKvZQ3fE:UExKTHHd3O0:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=1wyFKvZQ3fE:UExKTHHd3O0:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=1wyFKvZQ3fE:UExKTHHd3O0:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/1wyFKvZQ3fE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 13 Jul 2021 15:00:42 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/thefilmcasthorizontal-700x299.jpg","linkMd5":"b421ba4bd426979fbf76adf2229dfe92","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn22@2020_5/2021/07/13/17-22-05-625_1c2a1f36b312a5a7.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":299,"sourceBytes":25857,"destBytes":10964,"author":"David Chen","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/thefilmcasthorizontal-700x299.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn22@2020_5/2021/07/13/17-22-05-625_1c2a1f36b312a5a7.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn76@2020_5/2021/07/13/17-22-14-413_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=1wyFKvZQ3fE:UExKTHHd3O0:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn97@2020_2/2021/07/13/17-22-16-012_470cbdd5f9d3c2d1.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn3@2020_1/2021/07/13/17-22-14-788_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=1wyFKvZQ3fE:UExKTHHd3O0:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn64@2020_2/2021/07/13/17-22-13-962_5cc3c2b817ebb11d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/1wyFKvZQ3fE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn71@2020_2/2021/07/13/17-22-14-609_8cd3c2a91cee120c.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1626196915177},{"createdTime":"2021-07-14 01:21:55","updatedTime":"2021-07-14 01:21:55","title":"2021 Emmy Nominations: ‘Ted Lasso’ and ‘The Handmaid’s Tale’ Take the Most Nods","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=683277","description":"<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-677797 size-medium\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Ted-Lasso-season-2-release-date-1-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"2021 emmy nominations\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Ted-Lasso-season-2-release-date-1.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Ted-Lasso-season-2-release-date-1-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s that time again&#8230; time to celebrate the best of television entertainment! The <strong>73rd Primetime Emmy Awards</strong> will give us a chance to cheer for all of the small-screen champions who kept us somewhat sane during the past year. The golden era of television is only getting more glorious, with streaming services competing to deliver the absolute best entertainment possible. It means there&#8217;s a lot to choose from and sift through, but more content means, in this case, more good content.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-683277\"></span></p>\n<p>The Outstanding Drama Series category is a real trip this year, with heady historical dramas (<em><strong>The Crown</strong></em>, <em><strong>Bridgerton</strong></em>) facing down a superhero farce (<strong><em>The Boys</em></strong>) and the latest in the <em>Star Wars </em>universe (<em><strong>The Mandalorian</strong></em>). Disney&#8217;s <strong><em>WandaVision</em></strong> and <em><strong>Hamilton</strong></em> are both set to sweep the Limited Series and movie categories, with nine nominations between them. <em><strong>Ted Lasso</strong></em> is the comedy contender for the night with eight nominations, but it&#8217;s the drama <em><strong>The Handmaid</strong></em><strong><em>&#8216;s Tale</em></strong> that earned the most nods, scoring a whopping 11 nominations!</p>\n<p>&#8220;Virtual events kept us connected when we all needed it most, but I&#8217;m ready to celebrate face to face,&#8221; Television Academy Chairman and CEO Frank Scherma said in the live nominations announcement. The 73rd Primetime Emmy Awards will be an in-person event for all of its nominees to attend, a stark contrast from last year&#8217;s virtual show. It should feel like a return to a bit of normalcy, where we can celebrate <em>The Handmaid&#8217;s Tale</em> instead of feeling like we&#8217;re living through it.</p>\n<p>Check out the list of the biggest 2021 Emmy nominations below.</p>\n<h2>2021 Emmy Nominations</h2>\n<p><strong>Outstanding Drama Series:</strong></p>\n<p><em>The Boys<br />\n</em><em>Bridgerton<br />\n</em><em>The Crown<br />\n</em><em>The Handmaid&#8217;s Tale<br />\n</em><em>Lovecraft Country<br />\n</em><em>The Mandalorian<br />\n</em><em>Pose<br />\n</em><em>This is Us</em></p>\n<p><strong>Outstanding Comedy Series:</strong></p>\n<p><em>Black-ish</em><br />\n<em>Cobra Kai</em><br />\n<em>Emily in Paris</em><br />\n<em>Hacks</em><br />\n<em>The Flight Attendant<br />\nThe Kominsky Method<br />\nPen15<br />\nTed Lasso<br />\n</em></p>\n<p><strong>Outstanding Limited Series:</strong><em><br />\n</em></p>\n<p><em>I May Destroy You</em><br />\n<em>Mare of Easttown</em><br />\n<em>The Queen&#8217;s Gambit</em><br />\n<em>The Underground Railroad</em><br />\n<em>WandaVision</em></p>\n<p><strong>Outstanding TV Movie:</strong></p>\n<p><em>Dolly Parton&#8217;s Christmas on the Square<br />\n</em><em>Oslo<br />\n</em><em>Robin Roberts Presents: Mahalia<br />\n</em><em>Sylvie&#8217;s Love<br />\n</em><em>Uncle Frank</em></p>\n<p><strong>Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series:</strong></p>\n<p>Sterling K.

However, writer <strong>Eric Pearson</strong> explained that the traditional tag at the end of the credits was almost much different and much longer. In order to dive into the details, we&#8217;ll have to dig into spoiler territory, so if you haven&#8217;t seen <em>Black Widow</em>, then this is your last chance to flee.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Spoilers </strong>for </em>Black Widow <em>follow</em>.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-683288\"></span></p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/black-widow-credits-scene-explained/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">already taken a deep dive</a> into the <em>Black Widow</em> credits scene and what it means for the future of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The biggest takeaway is that Yelena Bolova (<strong>Florence Pugh</strong>) is working for Contessa Valentina Allegra de la Fontaine (<strong>Julia Louis-Dreyfus</strong>), <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-falcon-and-the-winter-soldier-cameo-explained/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a mysterious character</a> introduced in <em>The Falcon and The Winter Soldier</em>. Though their exchange is briefly humorous before setting up a mission of revenge when Yelena is told that Hawkeye is &#8220;responsible&#8221; for Natasha Romanoff&#8217;s death, the scene was first written to be much longer and more playful.</p>\n<p>Writer Eric Pearson recently spoke to <a href=\"https://collider.com/black-widow-post-credits-scene-explained-julia-louis-dreyfus/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Collider</a> about how the <em>Black Widow</em> credits scene came together, which was originally meant to mark the introduction of this character when the movie was scheduled to debut in theaters before any of Marvel&#8217;s Disney+ shows premiered. Pearson explained:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I just know that they told me we have plans to introduce this character Valentina, and it&#8217;s going to be played by Julia Louis Dreyfus. And I couldn&#8217;t get to the computer fast enough.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>It sounds like Pearson wasn&#8217;t really given many details about Val, but he was still able to craft the scene with her personality. Pearson was so excited about how Val would clash with Yelena, who has plenty of funny banter with Natasha in the movie. Pearson recalled:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;That tag scene was probably like five pages long because I was just so greedy. I was like, I want Yelena and Valentina just back and forth, bouncing dialogue off of each other. And ultimately that&#8217;s never going to happen. You&#8217;re not going to have a full scene as a stinger at the end. So we went with the smaller version, but I was just so excited to get those two actors together, to get those two character dynamics together. And I also love taking an emotional moment, like Yelena at the grave, and then flushing it down the toilet with Valentina blowing her nose.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-682044\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/falconandwintersoldier-contessa-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"The Falcon and The Winter Solder - Julia Louis-Dreyfus as Contessa Valentina Allegra de Fontaine\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/falconandwintersoldier-contessa.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/falconandwintersoldier-contessa-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<h2>More Val, Please</h2>\n<p>From what we&#8217;ve seen of Val so far, she&#8217;s extremely nonchalant about pretty much everything. There&#8217;s no room for sentimentality, and she doesn&#8217;t take anything very seriously, even if there are high stakes. Between her conversations with John Walker (<strong>Wyatt Russell</strong>) and Yelena Bolova, it&#8217;s clear Julia Louis-Dreyfus brings a casual attitude to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. But at some point, we&#8217;re hoping there&#8217;s a turn where we get to see how deadly serious she can be when it&#8217;s called for. Because a character like Val doesn&#8217;t hire people like John Walker and Yelena Bolova if she isn&#8217;t up to some nefarious shit.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re not sure when we&#8217;ll see Contessa Valentina Allegra de la Fontaine again, but a safe bet would probably be in the <em>Hawkeye</em> series, which is slated to arrive sometime later this year.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/extended-black-widow-credits-scene/\">The &#8216;Black Widow&#8217; Post-Credits Scene Was Almost Very Different</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=kmcZntpP-KA:O6CDGdXrf3c:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=kmcZntpP-KA:O6CDGdXrf3c:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=kmcZntpP-KA:O6CDGdXrf3c:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=kmcZntpP-KA:O6CDGdXrf3c:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=kmcZntpP-KA:O6CDGdXrf3c:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=kmcZntpP-KA:O6CDGdXrf3c:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/kmcZntpP-KA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 13 Jul 2021 15:52:07 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/blackwidow-florencepugh-gunpoint-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"0b1ae2171dcd6a1c5ed4053e9c8c8ab2","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn19@2020_6/2021/07/13/17-22-07-662_0ae9a17d1c9fc7ef.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":23851,"destBytes":12776,"author":"Ethan Anderton","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/blackwidow-florencepugh-gunpoint-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn19@2020_6/2021/07/13/17-22-07-662_0ae9a17d1c9fc7ef.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/falconandwintersoldier-contessa-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn68@2020_4/2021/07/13/17-22-23-674_6a0a909b5a9bfea7.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn76@2020_5/2021/07/13/17-22-14-413_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=kmcZntpP-KA:O6CDGdXrf3c:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn97@2020_2/2021/07/13/17-22-13-971_121e51d2c3aa1f8e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn3@2020_1/2021/07/13/17-22-14-788_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=kmcZntpP-KA:O6CDGdXrf3c:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn35@2020_1/2021/07/13/17-22-14-248_a6ad32dab143485d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/kmcZntpP-KA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn39@2020_1/2021/07/13/17-22-13-933_e0ab7db6a0c2c44c.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1626196915176},{"createdTime":"2021-07-14 01:21:55","updatedTime":"2021-07-14 01:21:55","title":"Walt Disney World’s Christmas Plans Are Here, and They’re Mostly Spectacular","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=683222","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-683226 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/tlh029385029834029348234-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/tlh029385029834029348234.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/tlh029385029834029348234-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>It’s Christmas in July, as the saying goes, and that means it’s a perfect time of year to wish it was the actual holiday season.

But in their place, we’ll get <strong>Disney Very Merriest After Hours</strong> (a title that presumes the event is somehow better than the Christmas Party, which had the temerity and sheer audacity to only be “very merry,” not “very merriest”) along with <strong>Minnie’s Wonderful Christmastime Fireworks</strong>.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-683237\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/disney-magic-kingdom-park-e1626180441236-700x299.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"299\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/disney-magic-kingdom-park-e1626180441236-700x300.jpeg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/disney-magic-kingdom-park-e1626180441236-360x154.jpeg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/disney-magic-kingdom-park-e1626180441236-768x328.jpeg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/disney-magic-kingdom-park-e1626180441236.jpeg 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<h2>Disney&#8217;s Very Merriest After Hours</h2>\n<p>Disney Very Merriest After Hours, aside from being a bit of a mouthful to say or type, is a new hard-ticket event (as ever, yes, that does mean you will have to buy a separate ticket from the basic admission), is a new way to enjoy the Magic Kingdom at the holiday season. The event won’t just feature those fireworks, but plenty of holiday decor and treats, as well as decked-out characters. Over at Disney’s <strong>Hollywood Studios</strong>, Sunset Seasons Greetings returns to offer guests plenty of holiday lights and theming. This event also allows you to see the Hollywood Tower Hotel turned into, among other locations, a Dickensian village inspired by <strong><i>Mickey’s Christmas Carol</i></strong> and the land of Arendelle from <strong><em>Frozen</em></strong>, which is&#8230;well, it’s going to be an interesting use of the Hollywood Tower Hotel, that much is sure.</p>\n<p>Plus all of this, there will be special celebrations at Disney’s Animal Kingdom, the International Festival of the Holidays returning to Epcot throughout the month of December, and plenty of ways to celebrate the season at the

Cast &#38; crew: I love you all. Thank you for putting your hearts &#38; souls into this project,&#8221; Gunn <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JamesGunn/status/1414783283653718016\">wrote</a>. </span></p>\n<p>The series &#8220;will explore the origins of the character that Cena will play in the upcoming film, a man who believes in peace at any cost — no matter how many people he has to kill to get it. The series will extend the world that Gunn is creating for <em>The Suicide Squad</em> movie, which is scheduled to be released in theaters by Warner Bros. Pictures on August 6, 2021.&#8221;</p>\n<p>While a show that explores the origins of a character sounds like a prequel, we still don&#8217;t know how this will all play out. Part of the mystery is because we don&#8217;t know if Cena&#8217;s Peacemaker lives through <em>The Suicide Squad</em>. &#8220;<em>Peacemaker</em> is an opportunity to delve into current world issues through the lens of this superhero/supervillain/and world’s biggest douchebag,&#8221; James Gunn said when the show was announced. &#8220;I’m excited to expand <em>The Suicide Squad</em> and bring this character from the DC film universe to the full breadth of a series. And of course, to be able to work again with John, Peter, and my friends at Warner Bros. is the icing on the cake.&#8221;</p>\n<p>John Cena added: &#8220;I have said before that it has been a tremendous honor and an incredible opportunity to be part of <em>The Suicide Squad</em> and to work with James on what is going to be a fantastic movie. I am unbelievably excited to have the chance to team up with him again for <em>Peacemaker</em>. We can’t wait for fans to see this.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/peacemaker-e1604067342820.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-643696\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/peacemaker-e1604067342820-700x320.jpg\" alt=\"peacemaker cast\" width=\"700\" height=\"320\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/peacemaker-e1604067342820-700x320.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/peacemaker-e1604067342820-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/peacemaker-e1604067342820-768x351.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/peacemaker-e1604067342820.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<h2><strong>Peacemaker Directors</strong></h2>\n<p>The news that <em>Peacemaker</em> has wrapped also comes with info on the show&#8217;s directors. Gunn confirmed that Jody Hill, the filmmaker behind <em>Observe and Report</em>, <em>Eastbound &#38; Down</em>, <em>Vice Principals</em>, and <em>The Righteous Gemstones</em><em>, </em>was one of the directors on the show. On Twitter, Gunn <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JamesGunn/status/1414022906699526144\">said</a>: &#8220;I&#8217;ve known Jody a long time.

So the existence of <strong><i>Gunpowder Milkshake</i></strong>, a new Netflix action film that feels reverse-engineered to draw in enough viewers to inspire at least one or two follow-up entries, is only surprising because it took so long for a studio to nakedly try to create its own John Wick.</p>\n<p>But as the old saying goes, a child prodigy may know the notes, but they still don’t know the music. <i>Gunpowder Milkshake</i> broadly tiptoes around what made <i>John Wick</i> work, but does so in a glib and hollow fashion. There’s a lot of flash and style, and all in service of an empty story with unmemorable gunplay.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-683223\"></span></p>\n<p><strong>Karen Gillan</strong> stars as Sam, a single-minded young assassin who works for a shadowy group called The Firm, which is made up of a lot of old white men in suits who control&#8230;well, to hear her tell it, they control everything. She’s watched over by Nathan (<strong>Paul Giamatti</strong>), a kindly member of the Firm’s HR group, which basically means he’s the guy who tells her who to kill, where, and when. After one job goes a bit pear-shaped, Nathan gives Sam her new assignment: retrieving cash stolen by a Firm accountant who’s in over his head. But that job goes even more pear-shaped: she inadvertently kills the nebbish, leaving behind his unassuming daughter Emily (<strong>Chloe Coleman</strong>). Since Sam herself was left orphaned by her mother (<strong>Lena Headey</strong>) 15 years ago, she gets guilty enough to drag Emily along on the rest of her now bloodier adventure, as she tries to keep the girl safe while killing some more bad guys and coming into contact with friends of her mother’s, all of whom are – like her – secret badass assassins.</p>\n<p>Co-writer and director <strong>Navot Papushado</strong> – best known in the States among indie crowds for directing the thriller <i>Big Bad Wolves</i> – wants very badly for <i>Gunpowder Milkshake</i> to be cool and slick, seemingly as inspired by Quentin Tarantino’s films as by the work of Chad Stahelski and David Leitch in the <i>John Wick</i> movies. (The film’s title is mostly nonsense, but whenever Sam meets up with Nathan, it’s at a 1950s-era diner with a big old-school milkshake with two straws jutting out of the glass.) But the problem is that the harder this movie tries to be cool, the more it struggles to actually <i>be</i> cool. Where <i>Gunpowder Milkshake</i> really stumbles is in trying to depict R-rated violence, replete with CG blood spatter, in a glib and cheeky manner. It’s not enough for Papushado to do a slow-motion tracking shot through the diner as Sam and her mother’s fellow assassins (played by <strong>Angela Bassett</strong>, <strong>Carla Gugino</strong>, and <strong>Michelle Yeoh</strong>) lay waste to handfuls of faceless baddies, but we have to hear an upbeat number on the soundtrack to play off the faux-bloody violence. It&#8217;s tired.</p>\n<p>Papushado, too, doesn’t always stage the action in impressive fashion. It’s nowhere near as incomprehensible as some modern action fare tends to be, but again, in a film inviting comparisons with <i>John Wick</i>, it’s hard to measure up, as much of the action happens all too quickly with jump cuts and rapid-fire editing. The cast is up to the task of the violence, with Gillan (unfortunately saddled with an American accent masking her native Scottish brogue) doing a fine riff on characters like John Wick and the T-800 from <i>T2</i>, as she plays off the blandly precocious Coleman. Headey, Bassett, Gugino, and Yeoh are all fun (though they’re mostly only present in the second half), but playing roles they could do in their sleep.</p>\n<p>That’s frankly how <i>Gunpowder Milkshake</i> feels as a whole – this is a movie that has sprung up out of existence less from creative desire than from a series of checkboxes and an unwieldy blend of past, better action films. Putting together a cast this talented either means that it’ll be somewhat frustrating to watch them stranded in fare that they’re too good for, or that the result will be an energetic blast. Sadly, <i>Gunpowder Milkshake</i> is the former. All of these actors are too good to appear in what ends up being such a rote, uninspired affair. For a studio like Netflix to see the success of <i>John Wick</i> and want to find something like that for themselves is perfectly logical. Who wouldn’t want to create a franchise out of whole cloth like that? But it’s hard enough to capture lightning in a bottle. <i>Gunpowder Milkshake</i> is as if the studio tried to force lightning into a bottle, and only got left with a stray spark or two.</p>\n<p><strong>/Film Rating: 4 out of 10</strong></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/gunpowder-milkshake-review/\">&#8216;Gunpowder Milkshake&#8217; Review: A &#8216;John Wick&#8217; Wannabe That&#8217;s Never as Cool as It Thinks It Is</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=PoGNRpGHbTM:ToZfclq81NU:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=PoGNRpGHbTM:ToZfclq81NU:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=PoGNRpGHbTM:ToZfclq81NU:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=PoGNRpGHbTM:ToZfclq81NU:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=PoGNRpGHbTM:ToZfclq81NU:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=PoGNRpGHbTM:ToZfclq81NU:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/PoGNRpGHbTM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 13 Jul 2021 14:03:36 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Karen-and-Chloe-GPM-5.11-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"b7e1ebe4d2bcab51d5e066146a1d8f31","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn5@2020_4/2021/07/13/17-21-55-495_eab9c59edf661ba6.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":26039,"destBytes":15042,"author":"Josh Spiegel","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Karen-and-Chloe-GPM-5.11-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn5@2020_4/2021/07/13/17-21-55-495_eab9c59edf661ba6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn76@2020_5/2021/07/13/17-22-14-413_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=PoGNRpGHbTM:ToZfclq81NU:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn80@2020_5/2021/07/13/17-22-14-848_8fde43702386bdc6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn3@2020_1/2021/07/13/17-22-14-788_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=PoGNRpGHbTM:ToZfclq81NU:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn12@2020_3/2021/07/13/17-22-14-712_246a4035de8b17d8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/PoGNRpGHbTM":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn94@2020_3/2021/07/13/17-22-14-646_4174aee31fd2d7c5.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1626196915176},{"createdTime":"2021-07-14 01:21:55","updatedTime":"2021-07-14 01:21:55","title":"New ‘Star Wars’ Toys Include X-Wing Pilot Dave Filoni & More as Hasbro PulseCon 2021 Exclusives This Fall","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=683036","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-683078 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/starwars-blackseries-pulsecon2021-exclusives-frontpage-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"Star Wars Hasbro PulseCon 2021 Exclusives\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/starwars-blackseries-pulsecon2021-exclusives-frontpage.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/starwars-blackseries-pulsecon2021-exclusives-frontpage-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Hasbro PulseCon <a href=\"https://hasbropulse.com/pages/hasbro-pulse-con-2021\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">is returning this year</a> to reveal a bunch of new toys and collectibles from <em><strong>Star Wars</strong></em>, <strong>Marvel</strong>, <strong><em>Transformers</em></strong>, <strong><em>Power Rangers</em></strong>, <em><strong>G.I.

The Rebel was one of a trio of pilots who descend upon the prisoner transport known as Bothan-Five at the end of &#8220;Chapter 6: The Prisoner.&#8221; Trapper Wolf then returned in &#8220;Chapter 10: The Passenger&#8221; alongside Carson Teva, portrayed by Korean Canadian actor Paul Sun-Hyung Lee. They first gave Mando some trouble, causing him to crash land on an ice planet, and then they showed up in the nick of time to help him with some terrifying ice spiders.</p>\n<p>This is the kind of<em> Star Wars</em> action figure that&#8217;s made for the hardcore fans. It&#8217;s also the kind of figure that could make for some fun diorama scenes on shelves. If you take Trapper Wolf&#8217;s head, give it a cowboy hat, and put it on a more generic action 6-inch action figure from Hasbro, perhaps one from Marvel Legends, then you have a Dave Filoni action figure that you can pose to direct scenes from <em>The Mandalorian</em>. We know all the kids are dying to add Dave Filoni to their <em>Star Wars</em> collection.</p>\n\n<a href='https://www.slashfilm.com/new-star-wars-toys-include-x-wing-pilot-dave-filoni-more-as-hasbro-pulsecon-2021-exclusives-this-fall/starwars-blackseries-pulsecon2021-cantinashowdown-box/'><img width=\"360\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/starwars-blackseries-pulsecon2021-cantinashowdown-box-360x360.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" alt=\"Star Wars Hasbro PulseCon 2021 Exclusives\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/starwars-blackseries-pulsecon2021-cantinashowdown-box-360x360.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/starwars-blackseries-pulsecon2021-cantinashowdown-box.jpg 700w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px\" /></a>\n<a href='https://www.slashfilm.com/new-star-wars-toys-include-x-wing-pilot-dave-filoni-more-as-hasbro-pulsecon-2021-exclusives-this-fall/starwars-blackseries-pulsecon2021-cantinashowdown-open/'><img width=\"360\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/starwars-blackseries-pulsecon2021-cantinashowdown-open-360x360.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" alt=\"Star Wars Hasbro PulseCon 2021 Exclusives\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/starwars-blackseries-pulsecon2021-cantinashowdown-open-360x360.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/starwars-blackseries-pulsecon2021-cantinashowdown-open.jpg 700w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px\" /></a>\n\n<h2>Star Wars: The Black Series – Cantina Showdown</h2>\n<p>Longtime fans of <em>Star Wars</em> action figures will recognize the Power of the Force packaging for this latest Black Series playset. The Cantina Showdown was a three-pack of 3.75-inch action figures from Kenner back in 1997, the year the Special Edition releases of the <em>Star Wars</em> trilogy arrived in theaters. Now that same box set inspired by <strong><em>A New Hope</em></strong> is being turned into a bigger 6-inch set.</p>\n<p>The Black Series Cantina Showdown playset comes with Obi-Wan Kenobi, Dr. Evanzan, and Ponda Baba action figures as well as a piece of the Mos Eisley cantina bar. There are no photographs of Ponda Baba with his arm cut off by Obi-Wan Kenobi&#8217;s lightsaber, but if one of his arms isn&#8217;t detachable, then that&#8217;s a real missed opportunity.

A bird flies out and defecates in the one unscarred eye of the would-be attacker, thus setting the stage of a film that itself is a minor miracle, one that also pairs the glory of religious expression with the everyday navigation of shit being flung.</p>\n<p>Based on an academic tome by Judith Brown published in 1986 that provided exacting detail drawn from the 17th century court proceedings, <strong>Paul Verhoeven</strong> and his <em>Elle</em> screenwriting collaborator <strong>David Birke</strong> have moulded this story of lesbian love, political corruption, and plague-era mischief into a work of salacious brilliance.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-683239\"></span></p>\n<p>Anchored by extraordinary performances by <strong>Virginie Efira</strong>, <strong>Daphne Patakia</strong>, <strong>Lambert Wilson</strong>, and the international treasure that is <strong>Charlotte Rampling</strong>, at its core the film is about the mechanism of lying and its underpinning of faith and belief, and the existential crisis that occurs when one encounters a confabulator even more capable of mass delusion, both regarding untruths told to others and especially the lies told unto themselves.</p>\n<p>This is a deeply nihilistic narrative, one that on its surface lays bare the raw political machinations supposedly done for higher purposes. An opening scene where a barter for the rate of dowry exhibits the collision between the pragmatic and the guise of ethical superiority, and from there the story exposes how the very institutions themselves corrupt any notion of purity of spirit.</p>\n<p>Along the way the two leads engage in congress in a way that’s equal parts erotic, engaging, preposterous, and profound. The humor at play is as dark as the plague. There are twin devices that are vaginally inserted that are two sides of the coin – one for pleasure, one for torture – but each in fundamental ways iconic talismans of the church’s power to shape behavior.</p>\n<p>As the violence escalates, the lies become more and more sophisticated, resulting in a Shakespearean battle of wills that upsets the direct balance of power within the convent. It’s only when the wall is breached that the true evil is let in, and the internecine battles between the nuns made more insignificant by the larger institutions that hold even greater power. Throughout we meet those who espouse faith while holding little belief in higher powers themselves, parsing evidentiary elements of supposed miracles, or being skeptical that the convenient excuses of religious epiphany appear identical to the ravings of lunacy.</p>\n<p>Shot with a cool touch, the film looks like some lost tapestry, with candle-lit cells and dreary convent walls speaking of the insular nature of the nuns. Even in the broad daylight there’s a muddy palor, yet the spark connecting Benedetta to her lover glows as bright as the sun.</p>\n<p>This is another in Verhoeven’s long career of films that manage to be satiric, provocative, banal and bravura simultaneously, with several fart jokes littered amongst dialogue scenes that are presented with a chilly formalism. The web of connections between the characters, particularly the nuns, exhibit a cloistered, claustrophobic dread, even when moments of intimacy are allowed to shine.</p>\n<p>This is a film unafraid to be soiled, unabashed to lay bare the truths of the lies and the hypocrisies of the hyperbolically chaste. The result in a film where the most just must be sacrificed and the most corrupt allowed to rise implausibly to power, all under the guise of an invisible being supposedly controlling even the most wicked of acts.</p>\n<p>Verhoeven made clear that this cannot be blasphemy, for it is based on what really happened. Whether that logic stands is up for debate, but what’s not is that this is a tonally rich, libidinously powerful, and psychologically complex tale told by a master filmmaker equally at ease with European art-film conventions and B-movie hijinks. It’s this exceptional balance between the profane and the profound that sets <em>Benedetta</em> apart, truly proving to be penetrating in its effect in more ways than one.</p>\n<p><strong>/Film Rating: 8.5 out of 10</strong></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/benedetta-review-cannes/\">&#8216;Benedetta&#8217; Review: Paul Verhoeven&#8217;s Lesbian Nun Drama Toes the Line Between Profound and Profane [Cannes]</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=uoHhvie70gI:o5NQBmrnPW8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=uoHhvie70gI:o5NQBmrnPW8:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=uoHhvie70gI:o5NQBmrnPW8:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=uoHhvie70gI:o5NQBmrnPW8:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=uoHhvie70gI:o5NQBmrnPW8:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=uoHhvie70gI:o5NQBmrnPW8:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/uoHhvie70gI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 13 Jul 2021 13:30:17 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/benedetta-e1626181027566-700x299.jpeg","linkMd5":"51c10d1325d708b52954053651a55751","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn24@2020_1/2021/07/13/17-22-03-358_fda85d634b73890e.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":299,"sourceBytes":21914,"destBytes":10922,"author":"Jason Gorber","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/benedetta-e1626181027566-700x299.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn24@2020_1/2021/07/13/17-22-03-358_fda85d634b73890e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn76@2020_5/2021/07/13/17-22-14-413_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=uoHhvie70gI:o5NQBmrnPW8:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn6@2020_1/2021/07/13/17-22-14-175_2ea9d9e5c3813c6e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn3@2020_1/2021/07/13/17-22-14-788_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=uoHhvie70gI:o5NQBmrnPW8:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn44@2020_2/2021/07/13/17-22-14-270_c56a5fb4ae368ecc.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/uoHhvie70gI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn27@2020_6/2021/07/13/17-22-14-358_73a927a5790ffcbb.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1626196915177},{"createdTime":"2021-07-14 01:21:55","updatedTime":"2021-07-14 01:21:55","title":"New ‘Dune’ Trailer and Footage Coming to IMAX Theaters – Here’s How You Can See It For Yourself","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=683336","description":"<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-612810 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/dune-1-e1586869122650-700x315.jpg\" alt=\"dune images\" width=\"700\" height=\"315\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/dune-1-e1586869122650-700x315.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/dune-1-e1586869122650-360x162.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/dune-1-e1586869122650-768x346.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>It’s been a hot minute since Warner Bros. released any teaser footage of <strong><em>Dune</em></strong><em>. </em>(That “hot minute” phrase is intentional, by the way.

Next year, the <em><strong>Scream</strong></em> franchise makes a comeback with its highly-anticipated fifth movie. Here’s everything you need to know before the latest slasher hits theaters.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-682204\"></span></p>\n<h2>Scream Release Date and Where You Can Watch It</h2>\n<p>Production on <em>Scream</em>, or <em><strong>Scream 5</strong></em> as we&#8217;ll call it, was set to begin back in May 2020, before being delayed due to pandemic complications. Thankfully, filming was safely underway by September and officially wrapped that November. With production finally concluded as of July, the film is currently scheduled for release on <strong>January 14, 2022</strong>.</p>\n<p>It’s a bit of a wait but apparently, many precautions have been taken to assure nothing leaks before the film&#8217;s official release. We previously <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/new-scream-movie-multiple-versions-spoilers/\">reported</a> that there are multiple versions of the screenplay and alternate endings shot to help hide all the set secrets.</p>\n<h2>What is Scream 5?</h2>\n<p>Back in 1996, legendary director <strong>Wes Craven</strong> revitalized horror movies with his witty slasher flick, <strong><em>Scream</em></strong>. It took notes from the many famous slashers and horror movies of the past, using their trends and formulas to wink at the audience and make fun while causing terror. The film followed teenager Sydney Prescott (<strong>Neve Campbell</strong>) and its three sequels continued to torture her into adulthood. She’s stalked by the masked and mysterious Ghostface, a mysterious killer that murders those around her, in an effort to kill Sydney herself or simply torment her with their deaths.</p>\n<p>In the fourth film, Sydney returns to Westboro and reconnects with friends that survived the Ghostface attacks of the past. But her return inspires yet another masked killer, donning the iconic Ghostface mask. Things go as usual: everyone in danger, a killer on the loose, a series of attempts to discover who it is, and the final unmasking of Ghostface. And plenty of blood spilled along the way.</p>\n<h2>Is Scream 5 a Sequel or a Reboot?</h2>\n<p>Here’s where things get interesting: this latest installment in the franchise presently titled <em>Scream</em>, with no number attached. Though it&#8217;s billed as a reboot, it&#8217;s also a direct sequel to <em><strong>Scream 4</strong></em>, a film that followed the events of the trilogy but also added a new cast of teenagers to join the familiar cast of adults. <em>Scream 5</em> is expected to take a similar approach.</p>\n<h2>Scream Synopsis</h2>\n<p>Few details have been revealed about the specific story of <em>Scream 5</em>, but here’s the synopsis.</p>\n<blockquote><p>A new installment of the &#8216;Scream&#8217; horror franchise will follow a woman returning to her home town to try to find out who has been committing a series of vicious crimes.</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Scream Cast</h2>\n<p><em>Scream 5</em> sees the return of the beloved final girl and star of the previous films, <strong>Neve Campbell</strong> as Sydney Prescott. Also reprising their roles are <strong>David Arquette</strong>, <strong>Courtney Cox</strong>, <strong>Roger L. Jackson</strong>, and <strong>Marley Shelton</strong>. Westboro newcomers include <strong>Melissa Barrera</strong> (<strong><em>In the Heights</em></strong>), <strong>Jenna Ortega</strong> (<strong><em>The Fallout</em></strong>), <strong>Mason Gooding</strong> (<em><strong>Love Victor</strong></em>), and <strong>Dylan Minnette</strong> (<em><strong>13 Reasons Why</strong></em>) likely playing the latest teenage targets of Ghostface.</p>\n<h2>Scream Director, Crew, and More</h2>\n<p>Sadly, <em>Scream 5</em> is the first in the franchise not to be directed by Wes Craven, who passed in 2015. But the film still has an impressive team behind it, with filmmakers who understand the weight of the franchise legacy. This includes the directing team of <strong>Matt Bettinelli-Olpin</strong> and <strong>Tyler Gillett, </strong>who previously worked on the 2012 anthology film <em><strong>V/H/S</strong></em> and more recently, 2019&#8217;s <em><strong>Ready or Not</strong></em>. The latter film was a pleasant and bloody surprise, blending horror, black comedy, and satire just as the <em>Scream</em> franchise before it.</p>\n<p><em>Scream 5</em> is written and produced by James Vanderbilt, the writer behind <em>Ready or Not</em> and <strong>David Fincher</strong>&#8216;s 2007 thriller <em><strong>Zodiac</strong></em>. <strong>Paul Neinstein</strong>, <strong>Chad Villella,</strong> and <strong>William Sherak</strong> are set to produce. The score will be handled by <strong>Brian Tyler</strong> (<strong><em>Fast &#38; Furious</em></strong>, <em>Ready or Not</em>, <em><strong>Escape Room</strong></em>).</p>\n<h2>Scream Teaser</h2>\n<p>We have yet to see a trailer or any real footage from the film, but director <strong>Matt Bettinelli-Olpin</strong> recently tweeted a photo celebrating the completion of the film.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-681597 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Scream-5-700x525.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"525\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Scream-5-700x525.png 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Scream-5-360x270.png 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Scream-5-768x576.png 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Scream-5.png 1262w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>With production now completed, hopefully, an actual peek at the film is soon to follow.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/scream-release-date-cast-and-more/\">Scream: Release Date, Cast and More</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=ijk4gwcCSNE:xctrmqOttAo:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=ijk4gwcCSNE:xctrmqOttAo:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=ijk4gwcCSNE:xctrmqOttAo:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=ijk4gwcCSNE:xctrmqOttAo:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=ijk4gwcCSNE:xctrmqOttAo:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=ijk4gwcCSNE:xctrmqOttAo:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/ijk4gwcCSNE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 13 Jul 2021 15:41:44 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/scream-5-e1605710973270-700x364.jpeg","linkMd5":"6c4cdf0d380ed64afe88ed9a8eb7ca4d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn13@2020_1/2021/07/13/17-22-07-360_a70ef0ce1d52a8e0.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":364,"sourceBytes":24354,"destBytes":14502,"author":"Shania Russell","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/scream-5-e1605710973270-700x364.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn13@2020_1/2021/07/13/17-22-07-360_a70ef0ce1d52a8e0.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Scream-5-700x525.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn44@2020_6/2021/07/13/17-22-13-971_12a0ece587aec4f4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn76@2020_5/2021/07/13/17-22-14-413_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=ijk4gwcCSNE:xctrmqOttAo:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn95@2020_4/2021/07/13/17-22-14-340_365c1f3481a1bd2d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn3@2020_1/2021/07/13/17-22-14-788_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=ijk4gwcCSNE:xctrmqOttAo:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn87@2020_1/2021/07/13/17-22-13-956_9ae38f0d4c50c80a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/ijk4gwcCSNE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn63@2020_5/2021/07/13/17-22-14-778_97c5f43af8d0b431.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1626196915177},{"createdTime":"2021-07-14 01:21:55","updatedTime":"2021-07-14 01:21:55","title":"The Future of /Film: A Long-Awaited Redesign, a Newly Expanded Writing Staff, and Saying Farewell to an Old Friend","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=682787","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-682835 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/SlashFilm-Logo-700x233.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"233\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/SlashFilm-Logo-700x233.jpeg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/SlashFilm-Logo-360x120.jpeg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/SlashFilm-Logo-768x256.jpeg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/SlashFilm-Logo.jpeg 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Change is hard. Change is exciting. Change is an opportunity for us to break out any number of cliches to talk about change, because it can be ecstatic and painful and bittersweet and thrilling. This is especially true when it comes to the places you love – including the movie websites you visit on a regular basis.</p>\n<p><strong>/Film</strong> is in the midst of its biggest change since it was founded back in 2005. And we get it. Change is weird. But it&#8217;s also exciting. Lots of things are changing for this website right now, both behind the scenes and on the front page, but this is our promise to you: /Film will always be /Film, your smart, honest, enthusiastic, occasionally a bit snarky (but never cruel) source for all things movie, television, and pop culture. We&#8217;re not going anywhere, even as we welcome a brand new look and a bunch of new faces, and as we say goodbye to one of our oldest friends.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what lies ahead for /Film in the weeks and months ahead.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-682787\"></span></p>\n<h2>A Total Site Redesign</h2>\n<p>When I first joined /Film back in 2015 (was it really that long ago?), there were already discussions of when and how to redesign the site. But today, we can reveal that the site is finally getting the overhaul it deserves.</p>\n<p>In the very near future (exact date to be determined), /Film will relaunch with a spiffy new design that will do away with our current look entirely and change the way you read and enjoy the site. The desktop redesign will launch simultaneously with a new mobile site. In addition to aesthetics, the new design will load much faster, and it will be easier to navigate and find articles as they are published. It&#8217;s a total overhaul, and one that will benefit everyone.</p>\n<p>However, the writing will still be /Film through and through. But now, it&#8217;ll be presented in a shiny and modern package, and we can&#8217;t wait for you to see it.</p>\n<h2>The Comments Section is Going Away</h2>\n<p>There is one element of the redesign that we understand will be controversial: the comments section will no longer exist in the relaunched /Film. This was a major point of conversation for the team, as we understand many friendships were formed in our comments section over the years. So if you have any internet friends you want to stay in touch with, please use the comments section under this article to let your fellow commenters know where they can find you, and arrange ways to stay in touch after the relaunch.</p>\n<p>If you want to remain an active member of the /Film community, our social media feeds are currently undergoing a major overhaul and are ready for your participation, but we&#8217;ll talk about that in a moment.</p>\n<h2>The Writers You Enjoy Aren&#8217;t Going Anywhere</h2>\n<p>Even as things change, plenty will remain the same&#8230;even though everyone has new titles. /Film founder <strong>Peter Sciretta</strong> is now editorial director, and I am now senior news editor. We&#8217;re still doing a lot of the old things – but also a lot of new things, too.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the core crew is more active than ever. <strong>Hoai-Tran Bui</strong> has accepted a promotion to news editor, while <strong>Bradford Oman </strong>(AKA <strong>Ethan Anderton</strong>) and <strong>Chris Evangelista</strong> have joined <strong>Ben Pearson</strong> as senior writers. Chris has also taken on the title of chief film critic. All titles reflect what they have brought to the site over the years and how they will continue to lead the charge in how /Film reads and sounds, even as our look changes.</p>\n<h2>There Are a Bunch of New Names on the News Staff</h2>\n<p>If you&#8217;re a regular reader, you may have noticed a number of new names contributing on a regular basis. That&#8217;s because, in addition to our regular contributors and columnists (who also aren&#8217;t going anywhere), we have expanded our news desk with names both new and familiar to /Film.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;d like to officially welcome <strong>Jeremy Mathai</strong>, <strong>Shania Russell</strong>, <strong>Danielle Ryan</strong>, <strong>Vanessa Armstrong</strong>, <strong>Joshua Meyer</strong>, <strong>Marisa Mirabal</strong>, and <strong>Eric Vespe</strong> to the /Film news desk. What this means is, well, <em>more</em>. More news articles on a daily basis, more articles during the evenings and weekends, more deep-dives into your latest obsessions, and more feature writing in general.</p>\n<p>In addition, <strong>Chris Gates</strong> is our new features editor, overseeing a new section of the site focused on lists and longform posts. <strong>Ariel Fisher</strong> has joined the site as our evening editor, taking care of late-breaking news after the daytime crew has shuffled home. We have also handed theme park coverage over to regular contributor <strong>Josh Spiegel</strong>, who has transformed the Theme Park Bits column into an ongoing beat.</p>\n<p>As /Film heads into its next generation, having a passionate, diverse, and talented staff of writers of all tastes and backgrounds remains vital. This is just the beginning, and we hope you enjoy reading them as much as we do.</p>\n<h2>Our Social Media is Receiving an Overhaul</h2>\n<p>If you read /Film but don&#8217;t follow us on social media, this is the perfect time to start. Our <a href=\"https://twitter.com/slashfilm\">Twitter feed</a> has been overhauled and now acts as the feed for the site itself (it stopped being Peter&#8217;s personal feed a little while back, but you can still follow him <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PeterSciretta\">here</a>). Twitter is still one of the best places to track new /Film articles, but it will now include updates on movie and TV news not covered in full posts, as well as cool movie trivia and looks back at some of our favorite moments in cinema history. Our goal is for it to be a feed that entertains as much as it offers links to our stories.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the changes continue to our <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/slashfilm\">Facebook page</a>, and our brand new <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/slashfilm/\">Instagram page</a> is just waiting for /Film readers to start following it.</p>\n<h2>The Future of Podcasts on /Film</h2>\n<p>And now we get to the bittersweet part. As you may have <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-slashfilmcast-is-now-the-filmcast-heres-what-you-need-to-know/\">already seen in a previous post written by <strong>David Chen</strong></a>, <strong>The Slashfilmcast</strong> is rebranding to <strong>The Filmcast</strong> and is parting ways with /Film.

Reviews out of the Cannes Film Festival have ratcheted up anticipation even higher, praising the distinctive auteur&#8217;s typically earnest approach, ambitious style, and masterful grasp of tone.</p>\n<p>Now, we can whet appetites even further with the newest clip released for the upcoming film, centering on a steamy (pun absolutely intended) interaction between a very unclothed <strong>Timothée Chalamet</strong> in the bath and <strong>Frances McDormand</strong>. Take a look for yourself.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-683249\"></span></p>\n<h2>The French Dispatch Clip</h2>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dvubfl-qeC8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>To set the scene, <em>The French Dispatch</em> is very much an anthology film with each chapter dealing with its own specific storyline. As you may have gathered from this clip, this sequence revolves around a group of protestors — McDormand&#8217;s Lucinda Krementz has apparently just been tear-gassed (and is also sad, but most definitely not lonely) — during student riots in 1960s France. Zeffirelli (Chalamet) is boasting about his revolutionary manifesto, but Mrs. Krementz is&#8230;unimpressed, to say the least, and subsequently gets to work correcting typos and offering pointed critiques. Editors: can&#8217;t live with them and can&#8217;t live without &#8217;em, am I right?</p>\n<p>As one of those dorks who tries to avoid trailers for movies I know I&#8217;m going to watch, I have to admit I caved with this clip and am mildly blown away by just how well both McDormand and Chalamet acquit themselves with Anderson&#8217;s bone-dry dialogue and utterly deadpan sense of humor. Of course, this isn&#8217;t McDormand&#8217;s first go-around in a Wes Anderson film, as the popular actor also starred in the delightful <em><strong>Moonrise Kingdom</strong></em>, but Chalamet carries himself as if he were a longtime Anderson muse and seamlessly slides into this sneakily demanding role.</p>\n<p>Anderson has <a href=\"https://www.indiewire.com/2019/04/wes-anderson-french-dispatch-details-interview-release-date-1202059011/\">previously described his approach to this film</a>, saying:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;The story is not easy to explain. [It’s about an] American journalist based in France [who] creates his magazine. It is more a portrait of this man, of this journalist who fights to write what he wants to write. It’s not a movie about freedom of the press, but when you talk about reporters you also talk about what’s going on in the real world.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>As /Film&#8217;s Jason Gorber puts it in his<a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-french-dispatch-review-cannes/\"> review out of Cannes</a>, &#8220;It’s a film that weaponizes whimsy in ways that will dazzle die-hard fans of the director. As long as your heart is open, your ears attuned to the pace of the proceedings and eyes accustomed to this mode of staging, you’ll have a quite remarkable experience gorging on this gorgeous film.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Featuring an endlessly talented cast including (but not limited to) <strong>Bill Murray</strong>, <strong>Owen Wilson</strong>, <strong>Tilda Swinton</strong>, McDormand, <strong>Adrien Brody</strong>, <strong>Benicio Del Toro</strong>, <strong>Jeffrey Wright</strong>, <strong>Léa Seydoux</strong>, Chalamet, <strong>Elisabeth Moss</strong>, <strong>Edward Norton</strong>, <strong>Willem Dafoe</strong>, <strong>Saoirse Ronan</strong>, <strong>Christophe Waltz</strong>, and <strong>Jason Schwartzman</strong>, <em>The French Dispatch</em> arrives at a theater near you on <strong>July 24,</strong> <strong>2020</strong>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-french-dispatch-clip-frances-mcdormand-timothee-chalamet/\">&#8216;The French Dispatch&#8217;
