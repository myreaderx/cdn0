We know with a mute creaturely knowledge, and we spend our complex lives hedging against it with all of our arts and antagonisms, that everything eventually ends &#8212; each love, each life, the universe itself. The succulent dream of eternity is kerneled with the hard fact that in a mere four billion years, the Sun &#8212; this common star whose modest yellow light kissed us into being amid the rude blankness of pure spacetime &#8212; will spin into its final collapse and take with it every mitochondrion and every trace of Beethoven.

His love of nature never left him but, in a testament to Richard Feynman&#8217;s timeless <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2013/01/01/ode-to-a-flower-richard-feynman/\"><em>Ode to a Flower</em></a>, was only magnified by the lucidity of his scientific training. </p>\n<p>In consonance with poet Diane Ackerman&#8217;s lovely notion of living as an <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2020/12/23/diane-ackerman-earth-ecstatic/\">&#8220;Earth ecstatic&#8221;</a> where others might subscribe to a particular religion, Lanham writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Evolution, gravity, change, and the dynamic transformation of field into forest move me.

As I wander into the predawn dark of an autumn wood, I feel the presence of things beyond flesh, bone, and blood. My being expands to fit the limitlessness of the wild world.

Walt Whitman &#8212; a poet <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2020/12/16/on-the-beach-alone-at-night-walt-whitman/\">with a scientist&#8217;s soul</a> &#8212; knew this when he described himself as a &#8220;kosmos&#8221; containing a multitude of identities and inheritances, creaturely, cosmic, and cultural. Lanham knows this in taxonomizing the Linnaean poetics of his own personhood: </p>\n<blockquote><p>My being finds its foundation in open places.</p>\n<p>I’m a man of color &#8212; African American by politically correct convention &#8212; mostly black by virtue of ancestors who trod ground in central and west Africa before being brought to foreign shores. In me there’s additionally an inkling of Irish, a bit of Brit, a smidgen of Scandinavian, and some American Indian, Asian, and Neanderthal tossed in, too. But that’s only a part of the whole: There is also the red of miry clay, plowed up and planted to pass a legacy forward. There is the brown of spring floods rushing over a Savannah River shoal. There is the gold of ripening tobacco drying in the heat of summer’s last breath. There are endless rows of cotton’s cloudy white. My plumage is a kaleidoscopic rainbow of an eternal hope and the deepest blue of despair and darkness. All of these hues are me; I am, in the deepest sense, colored.</p>\n<p>I am as much a scientist as I am a black man; my skin defines me no more than my heart does.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This integrated view of his interior ecology informs his integrated view of human society and our relationship with nature:</p>\n<blockquote><p>To save wildlife and wild places the traction has to come not from the regurgitation of bad-news data but from the poets, prophets, preachers, professors, and presidents who have always dared to inspire. Heart and mind cannot be exclusive of one another in the fight to save anything.</p></blockquote>\n<figure  class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2019/06/17/the-lost-words-macfarlane-morris/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/thelostwords7.jpg?w=1200&#038;ssl=1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Art by Jackie Morris from <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2019/06/17/the-lost-words-macfarlane-morris/\"><em>The Lost Words</em></a> by Robert MacFarlane &#8212; a visual dictionary of poetic spells resisting the erasure of nature&#8217;s language from our cultural lexicon.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Complement with Thoreau on <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2018/03/08/thoreau-and-the-language-of-trees/\">nature as prayer</a>, his modern-day counterpart Sy Montgomery on what a lifetime of working with nonhuman animals taught her about <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2018/10/31/how-to-be-a-good-creature-sy-montgomery/\">the living holiness of nature</a>, and astrophysicist Marcelo Gleiser on <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/02/02/the-island-of-knowledge-marcelo-gleiser/\">how to live with mystery in the age of knowledge</a>, then savor this marvelous <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2020/11/21/the-lost-spells-macfarlane-morris/\">illustrating rewilding of the human spirit</a>.</p>\n<hr /><h3>donating = loving</h3><p class=\"flipboard-keep\">For 15 years, I have been spending hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars each month to keep <em>Brain Pickings</em> going.

As we dust ourselves off amid the rubble, bruised and indignant, we further pain ourselves with the exertion of staggering emotional energy on outrage at how reality dared defy what we demanded of it. </p>\n<p>The remedy, of course, is not to bend the reality of an impartial universe to our will. The remedy is to calibrate our expectations &#8212; a remedy that might feel far too pragmatic to be within reach in the heat of the collision-moment, but also one with profound poetic undertones once put into practice. </p>\n<p>Walt Whitman understood this when, felled by a paralytic stroke, he <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2017/12/20/walt-whitman-specimen-days-meaning-of-life/\">considered what makes life worth living</a> and instructed himself: “Tone your wants and tastes low down enough, and make much of negatives, and of mere daylight and the skies.” He spared himself the additional self-inflicted suffering of outrage at how his body failed him &#8212; perhaps because, having proclaimed himself <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2020/02/25/neri-oxman-walt-whitman/\">the poet of the Body and the poet of the Soul</a>, he understood the two to be one. He squandered no emotional energy on the expectation that his suddenly disabled body perform a counterpossible feat against reality to let him enjoy his beloved <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2018/06/05/walt-whitman-workout/\">tree workouts</a> and daily excursions to the river. He simply edited his expectations to accord with his new reality and sought to find his joy there, within these new parameters of being. </p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_64209\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/i-see-great-cloud-masses-with-at-times-half-dimmd-saddend-far-off-star_framed-print?sku=s6-8967899p21a12v52a13v54?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/margaretcook_leavesofgrass23.jpg?resize=680%2C864&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"864\" class=\"size-full wp-image-64209\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/margaretcook_leavesofgrass23.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/margaretcook_leavesofgrass23.jpg?resize=240%2C305&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/margaretcook_leavesofgrass23.jpg?resize=320%2C407&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/margaretcook_leavesofgrass23.jpg?resize=768%2C976&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/margaretcook_leavesofgrass23.jpg?resize=600%2C763&#38;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Art by Margaret C.

He&#8217;s just one of those shameless people who must necessarily exist in the world. You should keep the same thought readily available for when you&#8217;re faced with devious and untrustworthy people, and people who are flawed in any way. As soon as you remind yourself that it&#8217;s impossible for such people not to exist, you&#8217;ll be kinder to each and every one of them.

Even more infuriatingly, Marcus Aurelius reminds us, our outrage at some entirely predictable misbehavior by a person known to misbehave is a failure not of the other but of our own powers of reason: </p>\n<blockquote><p>You&#8217;ll find that none of the people who make you lose your temper has done anything that might affect your mind for the worse; and outside of the mind there&#8217;s nothing that is truly detrimental or harmful for you&#8230; After all, you even had the resources, in the form of your ability to think rationally, to appreciate that he was likely to commit that fault, yet you forgot it and are now surprised that he did exactly that.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Observing that to explode with rage at the offender would make no positive difference to their conduct and would only further perturb your own soul, he instead offers a two-step process for dealing with the situation, telescoping into the broad existential perspective and then microscoping into your own innermost values:</p>\n<blockquote><p>First, don&#8217;t be upset. Nothing happens that isn&#8217;t in accord with universal nature, and before long you won&#8217;t exist at all, just like [your heroes]&#8230; Second, fix your gaze on the matter at hand and see it for what it is, and then, keeping in your mind your obligation to be a good man and the demands of your humanity, go right ahead and do it, in the way that seems to you to be most just. But do it with kindness and modesty, and without dissembling.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This is but one manifestation of the central preoccupation of the <em>Meditations</em> &#8212; the lifelong project of learning to see clearly as the greatest self-defense against mental anguish. So much of our disappointment and rage, after all, stem from the clash between our misperceptions of things and the reality of things &#8212; they are the pain of disillusionment, inflamed in those moments when the veil of illusion is lifted or violently pierced to let us, finally, see reality. </p>\n<p>Reaching across space and time, across cultures and civilizations, Marcus Aurelius prescribes the antidote: </p>\n<blockquote><p>Always define or describe to yourself every impression that occurs to your mind, so that you can clearly see what the thing is like in its entirety, stripped to its essence, and tell yourself its proper name and the names of the elements of which it consists and into which it will be resolved. Nothing is more conducive to objectivity than the ability methodically and honestly to test everything that you come across in life, and always to look at things in such a way that you consider what kind of part each of them plays in what kind of universe, and what value it has for the universe as a whole.</p></blockquote>\n<figure id=\"attachment_55647\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/07/07/trouvelots-astronomical-drawings/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/eclipse.jpg?resize=680%2C552&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Total eclipse of the sun, observed July 29, 1878, at Creston, Wyoming Territory\" width=\"680\" height=\"552\" class=\"size-full wp-image-55647\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/eclipse.jpg?w=4885&#38;ssl=1 4885w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/eclipse.jpg?resize=240%2C195&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/eclipse.jpg?resize=320%2C260&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/eclipse.jpg?resize=768%2C624&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/eclipse.jpg?resize=600%2C487&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/eclipse.jpg?w=1360&#38;ssl=1 1360w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/eclipse.jpg?w=2040&#38;ssl=1 2040w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Total solar eclipse by <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/07/07/trouvelots-astronomical-drawings/\">Étienne Léopold Trouvelot</a>, 1878.

(One thing that has always troubled me about modern translations of ancient classics is that they present an opportunity to calibrate the inclusiveness of these teachings to our present hard-earned sphere of dignity without changing their message &#8212; an opportunity very few translators take, for it requires a formidably delicate balance between the rigors of scholarship and the responsibilities of a social conscience. Count on Le Guin, whose meditation on <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/10/17/ursula-k-le-guin-gender/\">being &#8220;a man&#8221;</a> remains the finest thing I have ever read on the history of gender in language, to leap at that opportunity and make something soaring.)</p>\n<hr /><h3>donating = loving</h3><p class=\"flipboard-keep\">For 15 years, I have been spending hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars each month to keep <em>Brain Pickings</em> going.
