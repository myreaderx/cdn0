I created <a href=\"https://www.adeeapp.com/\">Adee free accessibility plugin</a> for designers using Sketch and Figma, and in this article, Iâ€™m going to show you how to use the Adee plugin to generate alternative text inside Figma (and soon Sketch and Adobe XD) to make sure your design is inclusive.</p><h3>Why Alternative(alt) Text is important:</h3><p>Alt attribute, commonly referred to as <em>alt text</em>, is an essential element of an accessible presence. Alt-text is important because:</p><ul><li>One of the main reasons alt text was created is to help people with visual impairments. If you donâ€™t write alt text, some of the screen readers read the file name to the users and this could be the worst experience you can provide for Assistive Technology (AT) users on yourÂ website.</li><li>If images fail to load on your website, users will be able to get some idea of what your web page is about by reading altÂ text.</li><li>It will help search engines to understand what the image is about and to rank them in the image search results. According toÂ <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/guidelines/google-images?hl=en&#38;visit_id=637507578116686447-1887480013&#38;rd=1\">google</a>:</li></ul><blockquote>Google uses alt text along with computer vision algorithms and the contents of the page to understand the subject matter of theÂ image.</blockquote><h3>Adee alt text generator:</h3><p>Not all web developers take the time to caption all their images. Adee free alt text generator is an easy to use tool for designers for creating and generating Alt text in Sketch and Figma and sharing it with developers in order to help their end users to understand what an image actually contains.</p><p>Here are the steps you need toÂ follow:</p><h4>1- Selecting an image/images:</h4><p>There are a number of way you can choose images in the alt text section. A) select your intended image before opening Adee plugin B) select images from multi-selection field C) click on any image when the plugin is open and it will show up. You can only select 4 images atÂ once.</p><figure><img alt=\"Selecting images in Adee alt text generator\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*IPojrkeIRRapd7NuUQ4C0A.gif\" /><figcaption>Selecting images in Adee alt text generator</figcaption></figure><h4>2- ImageÂ format:</h4><p>Since any shape created on the Figma environment is also considered as SVG, you can exclude this format from the selection menu to make your life easier if you are only using PNG/JPG image formats. In addition, in Adee when you select an image, it automatically detects and displays the format of the image whether itâ€™s SVG, PNG orÂ JPG.</p><h4>3- ImageÂ type:</h4><p>There are two types of images to consider when creating alternative text. These types are including decorative or informative. Informative images add important information to a page while decorative images donâ€™t. At the end, this is a judgment that only the designer/author canÂ make.</p><p>In order to edit image type in Adee, after selecting an image, click on edit icon, and from the drop-down menu choose your intended type of image. Your selection will determine the other fields displayÂ next.</p><figure><img alt=\"Selecting image type in Adeeâ€™s alt text generator\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*-7LtIEWsIXhyAPPt0tk9Qw.gif\" /><figcaption>Selecting image type in Adeeâ€™s alt text generator</figcaption></figure><p>And finally, some important points to remember:</p><ul><li>For SVG images, instead of alt text, you need to use description and title. <a href=\"https://w3c.github.io/writing-accessible-svg/accessible-svg.html\"><strong>Description</strong></a><strong>: </strong>The &#60;desc&#62; element provides a longer human-readable description of the element that contains it. A description should be provided for complex SVG content, or where the SVG fulfils a particular function or purpose.<br><a href=\"https://w3c.github.io/writing-accessible-svg/accessible-svg.html\"><strong>Title:</strong></a><strong> </strong>The &#60;title&#62; element provides a short human-readable name for the element that contains it. At least one title should be provided for every SVGÂ image.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.codementor.io/@klevaj/more-insight-into-the-html-role-attribute-13q1n0cq1i\"><strong>Role=â€�imgâ€�</strong></a> attribute, describes the role of an element in programs that can make use of it, such as screenÂ readers.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/ARIA1.html#:~:text=The%20aria%2Ddescribedby%20property%20may,of%20an%20id%20reference%20list.&#38;text=Note%3A%20The%20aria%2Ddescribedby%20property,in%20the%20same%20DOM%20document.\"><strong>aria-describedby</strong></a> property may be used to attach descriptive information to one or more elements through the use of an id reference list.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/H67.html\"><strong>alt=â€�â€�</strong></a><strong>. </strong>A â€œnullâ€� alt attribute is not the same as having no alt attribute.<strong> </strong>The purpose of this technique is to show how images (i.e. decorative images) can be marked so that they can be ignored by Assistive Technology.</li></ul><p>At the end, all you need to do is to save the information and generateÂ them!</p><h3>Wrapping up:</h3><p>Designing for accessibility is not that hard! Itâ€™s always a good idea to talk and get feedback from your <em>real users and the target audience </em>you are designing for.<br>You can also try putting yourself in the same position as your users by using different types of assistive technologies such as voice-over and screenÂ readers.</p><p>These are all simple tools and methods of testing to get an idea of what someone experience when using assistive technology. Also most devices these days have accessibility settings such as magnifier, voice-over and contrast modifier which assist designers to understand user experience.</p><p>Design credits: <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/community/file/922923694852179640\">https://www.figma.com/community/file/922923694852179640</a></p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=e0916a607695\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://blog.prototypr.io/inclusive-design-generating-alt-text-right-inside-your-design-e0916a607695\">Inclusive Design: Generating Alt Text right inside your design.</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://blog.prototypr.io\">Prototypr</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 19 Apr 2021 06:42:21 +0000","feedId":22660,"bgimg":"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*2xEIlUWesYFbAPbTf_c3dw.gif","linkMd5":"72e3603c5dcba354e18fd308cd8e0aa9","author":"samine hadadi","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*2xEIlUWesYFbAPbTf_c3dw.gif":null,"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*IPojrkeIRRapd7NuUQ4C0A.gif":null,"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*-7LtIEWsIXhyAPPt0tk9Qw.gif":null,"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=e0916a607695":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn86@2020_5/2021/04/27/12-35-52-779_e28f0d68bfe20802.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1619526831178}],"record":{"createdTime":"2021-04-27 20:33:51","updatedTime":"2021-04-27 20:33:51","feedId":22660,"fetchDate":"Tue, 27 Apr 2021 12:33:51 +0000","fetchMs":181,"handleMs":5,"totalMs":271711,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":10,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"af0629e1ae74a27744b4cbd27b40a78e","hostName":"us-006*","requestId":"3d04af5c2f4e4e548bcb997b870c139c_22660","contentType":"text/xml;
