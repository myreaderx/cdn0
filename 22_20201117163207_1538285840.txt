That's essentially why weighted blankets are used for the therapeutic treatment of sensory disorders, anxiety, depression, autism, insomnia, and more. They're a relatively inexpensive, effective, and medication-free way to encourage calmness and relaxation. According to a Mayo Clinic Minute interview with Dr. Adam Perlman, it's kind of like what happens in the body <a href=\"https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-how-weighted-blankets-may-lift-anxiety/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">when you get a hug</a>.</p><p>More specifically for sleep, deep pressure can help relax the nervous system, <a href=\"http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2016/research-into-our-sense-of-touch-leads-to-new-treatments-for-autism/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reduce the stress hormone cortisol</a>, and encourage serotonin and dopamine production, which promotes relaxation and regulates our moods. Then, serotonin converts to melatonin, and that makes you sleepy. The tangential feelings of calm, safety, relief, and comfort only aid in your body's natural processes. There are also studies that demonstrate how grounding the human body during sleep <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15650465\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">measurably reduces or eliminates pain and stress</a>.&#160;</p><h2>How to choose the right weight for your weighted blanket</h2><p>If you're looking into giving one a shot, aim for a weight that's about 10% of your own body weight. My 15-pound blanket is a little more than 10% of my body weight, but it still feels perfect. If you feel like something heavier might make it harder to roll over or give you a feeling of being trapped, err on the lighter side.&#160;</p><h2>What makes Gravity's Cooling Blanket different?</h2><p><a href=\"http://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=999&u=1088116&m=89663&urllink=gravityblankets.com%2Fproducts%2Fcooling-blanketling-blanket\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\"><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5d0a4d320a2849257b11ab91?format=jpeg\" alt=\"190402_GB_GOTG_7317_1080x\" height=\"810\" width=\"1080\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The Cooling Blanket is definitely the most elegant iteration of a weighted blanket, and meshes well with the rest of my decor — something worth mentioning for traditionally bulky blankets.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Gravity Blankets</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></a></p><p>The <a href=\"https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=999&u=1088116&m=89663&urllink=gravityblankets.com%2Fproducts%2Fcooling-blanket%3Fvariant%3D28622152499274622152499274\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Cooling Blanket ($199)</a> is the company's cooler, more breathable version of its original, the <a href=\"http://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=999&u=1088116&m=89663&urllink=gravityblankets.com%2Fnkets.com%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\">Gravity Blanket ($195)</a>. It still uses glass beads instead of plastic poly pellets for a better experience (glass beads are smaller, denser, and make the blanket noticeably less bulky), but the duvet cover is made with a \"faux Tencel\" material that encourages airflow and keeps you from overheating. Like its predecessors, it too has Gravity's gridded stitching to keep the internal glass beads from dispersing unevenly during sleep.&#160;</p><p>You can find in understated <a href=\"http://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=999&u=1088116&m=89663&urllink=gravityblankets.com%2Fproducts%2Fcooling-blanketling-blanket\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\">white, gray, and navy</a> colors.&#160;</p><h2>Review of Gravity's Cooling Blanket</h2><p>The <a href=\"https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=999&u=1088116&m=89663&urllink=gravityblankets.com%2Fproducts%2Fcooling-blanket%3Fvariant%3D28622152499274622152499274\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Cooling Blanket</a> is still a weighted blanket, so I was skeptical of how much an updated duvet cover could do. In person, though, it did seem to keep me unnaturally well-regulated throughout the night. If you're imagining it feeling like the cold side of the pillow all the time, that's not quite the case. But it does feel cool, silky, and breathable at first touch and when readjusting — it's just not a persistent phenomenon. The cooling is more subtle, though nonetheless effective, than that. In this, it reminded me of workout gear: Good performance materials let me get through a yoga class without cursing whoever makes my leggings, but rarely do I notice the work being done to wick away moisture and dissipate heat while it's happening.</p><p>I slept with the <a href=\"https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=999&u=1088116&m=89663&urllink=gravityblankets.com%2Fproducts%2Fcooling-blanket%3Fvariant%3D28622152499274622152499274\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Cooling Blanket ($199)</a> as my main blanket with temperatures in the mid-80s with 75% humidity without AC or a breeze and never woke up uncomfortable. I was impressed with how well it managed to regulate my temperature. It won't be as airy as a linen top sheet, but it would be unrealistic to expect it to be. If you're looking for a way to make a heavy, 15-pound blanket more breathable, this may be your best option, though my personal experiences might differ from yours.</p><p>Another thing worth mentioning if you're going to drop $200+ on a blanket is that it's by far the most aesthetically pleasing weighted blanket I've ever used. If you care about the overall aesthetic of your room, and the rest of it sounds justifiable to you, this is the one that will be the most undetectable. It looks fresh and crisp — like any other quilt.</p><p><a href=\"http://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=999&u=1088116&m=89663&urllink=gravityblankets.com%2Fproducts%2Fcooling-blanketling-blanket\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\"><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5d0a4da50a2849258b7b24b2?format=jpeg\" alt=\"190402_GB_GOTG_7577_1024x1024\" height=\"768\" width=\"1024\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Gridded stitching makes sure the blanket&#39;s internal glass beads remain uniformly distributed.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Gravity Blankets</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></a></p><h2>The bottom line</h2><p>The <a href=\"https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=999&u=1088116&m=89663&urllink=gravityblankets.com%2Fproducts%2Fcooling-blanket%3Fvariant%3D28622152499274622152499274\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Gravity Cooling Blanket</a> is worth it if you want to experience the benefits of a weighted blanket but don't want to risk overheating or having to blast your AC all night.</p><p>If that doesn't describe you, it's worth looking into some alternatives before giving up the dream of owning a weighted blanket. There are under-$100 options on Amazon — like this <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B075F9ST7G/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&th=1&linkCode=sl1&tag=biip_061819_gravity-cooling-blanket-20&linkId=ac7e65381cad3fcad1878c5edf3122c8&language=en_US8&#38;language=en_US\"

it's hard to stop, so I'd plan for that).</p><p>Your budget and needs will determine what's the best value deal for you, but, regardless of which one you ultimately choose, I couldn't recommend trying a weighted blanket highly enough.&#160;</p><div id=\"ProductCard_5e34376424306a7d6b4f7194\" style=\"position:relative; display:block; width: 100%\"><iframe

questions about their platforms' handling of the 2020 election.</p><p>The two tech CEOs were summoned by Senate Republicans who were upset with the tech platforms' content moderation before and after the election. Facebook and Twitter have both added labels to posts made by President Donald Trump that falsely claimed victory in the election — Joe Biden <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/2020-election-results\">won the election</a> with 306 electoral votes — and spreading misinformation about voter fraud. Facebook also <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-political-advertising-ban-extended-memo-trump-spreads-election-misinformation-2020-11\">suspended all political ads</a> following the election to prevent the spread of false claims.&#160;</p><p>Republicans have argued that those warning labels amount to anti-conservative censorship, while Democrats have called on tech companies to more robustly crack down on hate speech and misinformation. On both sides of the aisle, lawmakers say tech companies should face more legal scrutiny.</p><p>The hearing comes as Republican leaders scramble to bolster Trump's claims that he actually won the election due to increasingly far-fetched theories — from a widespread conspiracy to \"rig\" the results to evidenceless claims that hundreds of thousands of votes were cast illegally. Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal lawyer who <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-campaign-lawsuits-election-results-2020-11\">is leading Trump's lawsuits</a> challenging the election, was linked to a story about Joe Biden's son in the New York Post that Facebook and Twitter both temporarily restricted last month amid questions about its accuracy.</p><p>Senate Judiciary chair Lindsay Graham, a South Carolina Republican, has also taken an outsize role in that push — Georgia's Republican Secretary of State <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/lindsey-graham-pressured-georgia-top-election-official-to-toss-ballots-2020-11\">said Monday</a> that Graham pressured him to find ways to discard legally cast ballots as the state conducts a hand recount this week.</p><p>Lawmakers are also expected to grill Zuckerberg and Dorsey about whether their companies should retain legal protections afforded by Section 230, a law that shields social media sites from being held liable for users' posts in the way that publishers are responsible for content they produce.</p><p>\"When it comes to social media platforms and Section 230, change is going to come,\" Graham said in his opening statement at the hearing Tuesday.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

stories</a>.</li>\n</ul><p dir=\"ltr\">Last year, 2020 was heralded as the exciting start of the century's third decade. Today, its conclusion can't come fast enough for most entrepreneurs. Yet the recent sweeping societal and corporate changes likely won't subside when the calendar hits 2021. In fact, they've altered life for the foreseeable future, and that's not all bad for businesses.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Case in point: Teleconferencing — <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/minda-zetlin/bill-gates-predictions-zoom-teams-videoconferencing-screen-size.html\">predicted long ago by Bill Gates</a> — has risen as an acceptable alternative to professional meetings and casual hangouts. As a result, Zoom's busting at the seams and <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/jason-aten/zoom-is-already-where-we-do-pretty-much-everything-it-just-got-even-better-at-it.html\">adding new perks and amenities</a>. And who could deny that many employees and companies are now&#160;<a href=\"https://www.inc.com/justin-bariso/microsofts-new-6-word-remote-work-policy-is-brilliant-heres-why-your-company-should-steal-it.html\">seeing remote work with fresh eyes</a>?</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Gartner research from July&#160;<a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2020-07-14-gartner-survey-reveals-82-percent-of-company-leaders-plan-to-allow-employees-to-work-remotely-some-of-the-time\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">showed 82% of executives</a>&#160;surveyed expected to allow telecommuting in some fashion post-pandemic. Even Google has&#160;<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/27/google-is-first-major-company-to-extend-work-from-home-to-summer-2021.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">backed off from an in-person headquarters mentality</a>, allowing some team members to work from home until at least mid-2021.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Virtual working and coronavirus-linked workforce transformations have ushered in some massive tech innovations and opportunities. Consequently, corporate leaders should keep an eye on the following trends aimed at swiftly adapting to tomorrow's norms.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><em><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-build-company-wellness-program-employees-healthy-motivated-2020-8\">How to build a comprehensive wellness program that keeps employees happy, healthy, and motivated for the long haul</a></em></p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">1. Remote workers requiring savvier back-end support and training</h2><p dir=\"ltr\">When COVID struck and workers decentralized en masse, work-home boundaries blurred. This phenomenon of \"work is everywhere and nowhere\" will continue as people lean toward more hybrid, fluid methods of balancing the professional and the personal.&#160;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">A boundary-less business world isn't necessarily conducive to buoyed worker confidence, however, especially when workers must rapidly make pivotal decisions without immediate managerial support. Employees therefore need to undergo regular training on platforms and tech they regularly use.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">IT staff will especially require heavy doses of regular education to meet heightened job demands. Yet Inc. 5000's IBEX IT Business Experts CEO and president Tracey Grace&#160;<a href=\"https://www.under30ceo.com/tech-expert-tracey-grace-on-cybersecurity-and-work-from-home-culture/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">believes</a>&#160;ongoing tech knowledge shouldn't be limited to information systems or IT personnel. Instead, all corporate system end users should be taught to recognize and mitigate security breaches so that everyone's empowered to make wise choices.</p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">2. Next-gen levels of automation</h2><p dir=\"ltr\">Automation has gone into hyperdrive with employees clamoring for better, faster ways to make their lives easier by mechanizing everyday processes in order to concentrate on more complex to-do items. As Placester COO and cofounder Fred Townes <a href=\"https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/9835-automation-tech-workforce.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">noted</a>, any repetitive task can be the catalyst for an automated solution.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">This doesn't mean there isn't a downside to automation, particularly when it comes to customer experience. Too much automation can lead to a drop in personalization, which sometimes leaves prospects and clients with an unsettled feeling.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">To combat the need for hyper-automation without losing the human touch, automated functions may benefit from occasional babysitting. Rather than truly being set-it-and-forget-it processes, they should be checked and tweaked. For example, an automated flurry of prospective buyer touch points could be regularly dusted off and retested with target personas. Just a bit of maintenance can ensure automation does what's intended.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><em><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/mailchimp-set-clear-goals-key-managing-remote-teams-2020-8\">Mailchimp's chief product officer says clarifying priorities should be your number one focus when managing a 100% remote team — here's how to start setting clear, actionable goals</a></em></p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">3. Predictive emotional AI</h2><p dir=\"ltr\">Imagine a machine that could gauge a user's emotions to determine which message to show next. This type of predictive AI, known as artificial emotional intelligence, is coming down the pike faster all the time. In fact, it's <a href=\"https://www.searchenginejournal.com/what-is-artificial-emotional-intelligence/255769/#close\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">been in the testing phases for years</a>.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">As AI becomes more adept at reading a prospective shopper's emotions, AI programming can assist in influencing behaviors. And the AI doesn't have to rely only on visual cues, either. Already, AI chatbots are learning to recognize when buyers are frustrated or may want to opt out by the words and punctuation they choose.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The biggest challenge with predictive artificial emotional intelligence lies in successfully interpreting signals. It's a fact of life that different people from different cultures will have different responses to the same stimuli, even if they share an overarching emotion. Therefore, until AI can prove itself to be airtight, marketers will still want to regulate and oversee this&#160;emergent technology.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Nevertheless, the idea of using AI to analyze everything from a raised eyebrow to a slight frown could give companies an edge. AI facial recognition equipment might one day be useful in retail situations to help reduce buyer hesitance and improve conversions.</p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">4. Touchless everything</h2><p dir=\"ltr\">A final tech trend that's taken off during the pandemic has been a move toward touchless-ness. Restaurants are touting curbside, contactless pickup. Retailers are offering touchless payment options. And more touch-free transactions are sure to come.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">However, not all organizations offer products or services that are conducive to being without touch. Being able to feel a pricey cashmere sweater can make the difference for a sale.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Before companies embrace a fully contactless society, they may need to consider other safe alternatives in order to give buyers and browsers a choice. Already, this is happening with self-checkouts and&#160;<a href=\"https://www.ultraleap.com/enterprise/touchless-interfaces/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">touchless ordering screen interfaces</a>&#160;to some extent.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The coronavirus may have stunted economic growth, but it didn't stunt tech innovation. As companies slide into 2021, corporate leaders will be faced with a bevy of technological choices to remain competitive, enhance growth, and win back sales.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/tech-trends-that-will-remain-popular-post-pandemic-2020-11'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=kaHtuW1nT0Y:8coolrMq3Uo:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=kaHtuW1nT0Y:8coolrMq3Uo:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=kaHtuW1nT0Y:8coolrMq3Uo:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=kaHtuW1nT0Y:8coolrMq3Uo:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=kaHtuW1nT0Y:8coolrMq3Uo:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=kaHtuW1nT0Y:8coolrMq3Uo:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=kaHtuW1nT0Y:8coolrMq3Uo:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=kaHtuW1nT0Y:8coolrMq3Uo:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/kaHtuW1nT0Y\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 17 Nov 2020 14:10:00 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5fb2d1881c741f0019aca11c?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"b2b5df52078d903dabc48bdd8d45b44e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn3@2020_1/2020/11/17/16-31-45-961_5748d89691323ad5.webp","destWidth":5439,"destHeight":4079,"sourceBytes":1132580,"destBytes":1132580,"author":"insider@insider.com (Joel Comm)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5e8de44a29d6d9403f14d215?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn83@2020_5/2020/11/17/16-31-55-901_2c69bc77b3e09bb8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn83@2020_3/2020/11/17/16-31-54-041_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=kaHtuW1nT0Y:8coolrMq3Uo:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn32@2020_1/2020/11/17/16-31-53-792_6359f9cf497256f1.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=kaHtuW1nT0Y:8coolrMq3Uo:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn88@2020_4/2020/11/17/16-31-49-937_5996c5b77d5f43f3.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn96@2020_3/2020/11/17/16-31-50-199_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=kaHtuW1nT0Y:8coolrMq3Uo:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn91@2020_3/2020/11/17/16-31-55-789_c16f9e54e99ef986.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/kaHtuW1nT0Y":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn59@2020_6/2020/11/17/16-31-52-152_4a373eaa91dd5d92.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605630688520},{"createdTime":"2020-11-18 00:31:28","updatedTime":"2020-11-18 00:31:28","title":"5 ways you can still get things done with a disorganized boss","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/tips-for-getting-things-done-with-disorganized-boss-2020-11","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5e346d3e62fa814ead0ae616?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Woman talking to boss\" height=\"2200\" width=\"3300\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>You can offer to organize your boss&#39;s files or ask meaningful questions.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Thomas Barwick/Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>Starting a new job can be challenging, but it can be especially tough if your boss is disorganized.</li>\n<li>Take some time to understand the work flows and team dynamics before changing everything to match your work style.</li>\n<li>Reach out to coworkers or previous people in your position, but be wary of building connections or bonding over your boss' shortcomings.&#160;</li>\n<li>Set clear parameters, questions, or expectations when asking your boss for help to keep them on track and focused on the problem at hand.&#160;</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>You're excited about your new job.

You need to find out how to keep the flow going, what the possibility is inside the thinking of your boss. Then, slowly start shifting how things are working in very small increments, and make sure you have your boss's approval.\"</p><p><em><strong>Read more: </strong><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/i-was-the-first-employee-of-startup-what-i-learned-2019-7\">I was the first employee of a huge startup.

Speak to the person who formerly held your position if you can, as well as your existing coworkers, to gain their insight into your boss's MO.</p><h2><strong>Listen up</strong></h2><p>\"Listen to verbal cues when your boss is in a panic and looking for that report,\" said Laura Leist, coauthor of the book \"Eliminate Chaos\" and president and founder of a Seattle company by the same name.</p><p>Leist also suggests&#160;<a href=\"https://www.monster.com/career-advice/article/Five-Ways-to-Stay-Organized\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">offering to organize</a>&#160;your boss's files for him and to ask plenty of questions along the way. This will ensure the filing system you help to create is actually useful and meaningful to your boss.</p><h2><strong>Work the network</strong></h2><p>Jeanne Hurlbert, a sociology professor at Louisiana State University and president of Optinet Resources in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, suggests establishing a support network. \"New employees need to build relationships with coworkers anyway,\" Hurlbert said. Working with a disorganized boss, \"however, exacerbates the need for that.\"</p><p>What a new employee shouldn't do is \"start off making negative comments about the boss or thinking that shared antipathy toward the boss provides good common ground on which to build relationships,\" she said. \"That's dangerous.\"</p><p><em><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/resources-resesarch-help-prepare-job-interview-2020-9\">The smartest candidates always use these 5 resources when prepping for interviews, according to an executive recruiter who's interviewed thousands of applicants.</a></em></p><h2><strong>Lead by example</strong></h2><p>The best defense is a good offense, so Studio City, California-based Bill Bliesath, also known as the&#160;<a href=\"http://www.theorganizingguy.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Organizing Guy</a>, suggests making sure&#160;<a href=\"https://www.monster.com/career-advice/article/get-organized-at-work\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">you are as organized as possible</a>. \"When you have questions about your responsibilities or projects, present them by topic in an order that flows smoothly and requires the minimal amount of input — i.e., yes or no answers,\" Bliesath said. \"Disorganized people tend to lose focus easily if there are no clear parameters or expectations. So you want to stay on the subject, and if the conversation strays, keep steering it back on track — with a smile of course.\"</p><p>One final thought from Nelson: \"The boss wouldn't be the boss — unorganized or not — if he/she weren't successful at what he/she does. So you don't want to mess with how that success gets done.

these days.</p><p>After college, she bounced around a bunch of jobs after a series of internships and got to the point where she was ready to launch her own business, and she spent two years getting it on its feet.</p><p>Then she was met with the sudden, forceful winds of the pandemic.&#160;</p><p>Most entrepreneurs don't have quite her family background, though. Born and raised in Monaco, Ducruet is a granddaughter of Grace Kelly through her mother, Princess Stéphanie of Monaco. A member of the Monegasque Royal Family, her uncle is reigning monarch Prince Albert II of Monaco, and&#160;she is 16th in line to the throne.</p><p>Ducruet's business, founded in 2019, is Alter Designs, a gender-neutral fashion brand she says she self-funded. She's obviously grateful to have her family background, but she also said it's added to the pressure of running her own business.</p><p>\"My work has to be irreproachable,\" she said.&#160;</p><p>The brand is gender-neutral, she told Business Insider, because she wanted her clothes to be for everyone. Personally, she said she loves unisex clothing and likes to wear men and women's clothes equally. It also embraced sustainability years before the pandemic challenged most fashion lines' bottom line.</p><p>And she told Business Insider that she got her start just like any other entrepreneur.</p><h2>Internships and climbing the ranks</h2><p>After holding internships at Vogue and Louis Vuitton, Ducreut worked as a stylist's apprentice at the Istituto Marangoni in Paris, and graduated from the prestigious Parsons School of Design in New York in 2017, with a degree in fashion.</p><p>From the start, Alter only used natural fibers such as pesticide-free silk and cotton in its clothing. The brand especially employs a lot of upcycling, meaning she reuses old fashion products so she doesn't have to produce much herself. She buys dead stalks of leather and denim and reuses them, so much of her inventory was never going to go to waste this year — everything was always going to be reused.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f8d8f28c21cfb0019468b2b?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Pauline Ducruet\" height=\"4146\" width=\"5528\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Pierre Suu / Contributor / Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Alter sells products such as <a href=\"https://alter-designs.com/produit/apron/\">$292 denim skirts</a> and <a href=\"https://alter-designs.com/produit/draped-tunic/\">$759 satin draped tunics</a>. Her first collection was presented in Paris in 2019.</p><p>Right now, Alter Designs is direct-to-consumer and eCommerce only, but the brand does do pop-up shops — an important part of her strategy in terms of connecting and growing her consumer base. Ducruet declined to disclose the finances for her business, citing the pandemic. \"Doing it all by myself, for now, it's a really hard rhythm to keep up,\" she said. \"I wanted to slow down a little bit.\"</p><p>The brand would have been celebrating the one-year anniversary of its first collection this past June, but the pandemic didn't just interrupt that — it forced the whole company to move.&#160;</p><h2><strong>Less than a year after opening her business, the pandemic almost ended it for good</strong></h2><p>Ducruet is usually based in New York, but she left the US in February to return to Monaco, just a few weeks before the EU <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/eu-opens-up-to-some-travelers-but-not-americans-11593524652\">shut its borders</a> for non-essential travel due to the pandemic.</p><p>Once she landed back in Monaco, Ducruet realized it might be years before she would be able to successfully bring her business back to the US, so she decided to move the entire production of her fashion line to France, which posed certain challenges. \"Monaco is such a tiny country,\" she said. \"We don't have factories here.\"</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f8d8ee2c21cfb0019468b2a?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Pauline Ducruet\" height=\"3000\" width=\"3999\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Pauline Ducruet dressing a model.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Francois Durand / Stringer / Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>This meant she had to, once again, find suppliers and factories that could house her collections. All when <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-italy-coronavirus-lockdown-is-impacting-luxury-industry-2020-3\">factories were already shutting down</a> worldwide and when the fashion and retail industries were taking huge hits from the pandemic.</p><p>In February, Boston Consulting Group and Bernstein <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-italy-coronavirus-lockdown-is-impacting-luxury-industry-2020-3\">estimated that the luxury sector</a> could lose nearly $45 billion in sales in 2020.&#160;</p><p>\"It was basically starting from scratch and it was challenging,\" Ducruet said. \"Especially as a young brand, you put all your effort into the people that do your pattern-making and sewing and everything.\"</p><p>The result? She adjusted the amount of clothing she produced and decided to sit out of Paris Fashion Week as she figured out the next steps for her brand. \"I've decided that I'm only going to do one collection a year. There's not going to be seasons now. It's just going to be a collection per year.\"&#160;</p><p>This will help the brand become even more sustainable, as it will cut down on&#160;excessive waste and on any extra inventory, especially as she continues adjusting her operations to keep her brand afloat during the pandemic.</p><h2>How to deal with a spotlight from a famous family? Emphasizing brand values</h2><p>Ducruet acknowledged that she has clearly benefited from the fact that her mother is a princess, and she is a member of a&#160;royal family.&#160;</p><p>\"People were following the family for years and years and years,\" she said. \"I have the spotlight on the brand, so that was a great thing, obviously, but I think it's also hard because then you put the spotlight on the bad things as well.\"</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f9c285d69331a0011bc64b8?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Pauline Ducruet\" height=\"3266\" width=\"4354\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Pauline Ducruet, Princess Stephanie of Monaco, Prince Albert II of Monaco, Louis Ducruet and Camille Gottlieb\n<p class=\"copyright\">SC Pool - Corbis/Corbis via Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Other notable members of the Monegasque royal family include the Casiraghi siblings, one of whom married billionaire heiress Tatiana Santo Domingo of the Santo Domingo Family — <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/tatiana-santo-domingo-billionaire-richest-citizen-heiress-monaco-royal-family-2019-10\">she is reportedly now the richest citizen in Monaco,</a> with a net worth of $2 billion.

The thoughts expressed are those of the author.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>Just two days after Election Day, President Donald Trump stood at the podium of the White House press briefing room and levied numerous baseless claims about the legitimacy of <a href=\"https://www.fox2detroit.com/news/trump-lambastes-detroit-in-ballot-counting-criticism-calling-it-corrupt\">absentee vote counting in Detroit</a>. The city is a stronghold for Michigan Democrats and helped tip the scales toward the eventual president-elect, Joe Biden, in our state.</p><p>After listening to the president's attacks on the process in the city, I want to share what I observed over 15 hours as a Democratic Party ballot challenger at TCF Center, the city's site for processing absentee ballots. Given the level of misinformation circulating about what went on inside TCF — much of it perpetuated by our president — I want to set the record straight.</p><h2>The ballot-counting process</h2><p>I went to TCF after I learned that throngs of Republican challengers had begun arriving there at about midnight on election night. My mandate — the same for all challengers regardless of affiliation — was to observe the process, raise a challenge if I had a legitimate reason to believe the law was not being followed, and contest any baseless challenges raised by others.</p><p>I saw election staff members working incredibly hard to count 165,000 absentee ballots in two days. For context, that's nearly three times as many as were processed in 2016.</p><p>The election workers were professional, efficient, diligent, and dedicated. They were working in a fishbowl with, at times, eight or 10 people crowding around them and yelling and harassing them about their work. These predominantly older, Black women wore masks and risked exposure to COVID-19 in a city that for much of the spring was a COVID-19 hot spot. They didn't get paid very much, but they never complained. They were heroes.</p><p>I also saw diverse and dedicated Democratic and nonpartisan volunteers. Our job was simple: Do everything we could (within the law) to shield the election workers from a withering barrage of unwarranted abuse from our GOP counterparts.</p><p>Repeatedly, we called supervisors and even police officers to blunt the attempts of the GOP challengers to slow, stop, muddy, or otherwise derail the process. We didn't have much to eat. We wore the wrong shoes. Our phones were dead or dying the whole time. We alternated between way too hot or too cold. But, through it all, we were laser focused on protecting our Democracy.</p><h2>The GOP got their challengers, despite what they claim</h2><p>That brings me to the final group of people I saw: the GOP poll challengers. In contrast to our goal, a speedy and secure tabulation of legal ballots, they had a single mission: to slow down or stop the counting as much as possible.</p><p>They had been told and were exhorted repeatedly by Republican organizers throughout the day to \"be more aggressive.\" They bullied. They complained. They <a href=\"https://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/11/02/poll-challengers-removed-detroit-ballot-processing-begins/6122976002/\">accused everyone of fraud</a>. They documented everything. They challenged everything. At times they challenged ballots before the ballots were even opened. At times, they tried to \"blanket\" challenge thousands of ballots at a time for some ridiculous reason or another. Blanket challenges are not legal.</p><p>When one of their <a href=\"https://www.wxyz.com/news/problems-arise-as-challengers-descend-up-detroits-tcf-center-not-allowed-in-due-to-capacity\">challengers was removed</a> for physically intimidating election workers and refusing after multiple warnings from supervisors to stop, the entire floor of workers cheered.</p><p>Why? Because these largely white, suburban, and rural challengers hurled insult after insult at hardworking, predominantly Black Detroiters — mostly women — simply trying to do their difficult jobs.</p><p>They accused them of fraud. They attacked their competence and their motives and their professionalism. They <a href=\"https://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/11/04/tcf-center-challengers-detroit-michigan/6164715002/\">stood too close</a>. They leaned in and over workers in the middle of a pandemic. They were <a href=\"https://www.bridgemi.com/guest-commentary/first-person-i-was-detroit-poll-challenger-gop-came-make-havoc\">rude and at times downright threatening</a>. One was removed for asserting his First and Second Amendment rights (think about that for a minute) in response to a request to step back a couple of feet.</p><p>Claims that GOP challengers were denied access to the room are utter nonsense. Each party was allowed 134 challengers (one for each table), in addition to lawyers. At one point <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/11/10/fact-check-videos-crowd-locked-out-detroit-center-lack-context/6195038002/\">at least 230 Republican challengers</a> were signed into the room, and access to the room was stopped for everyone because the room was at capacity. This caused <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-donald-trump-michigan-elections-detroit-1eb5f7ea8cbfb0031769e300f4d529ce\">the GOP to file a lawsuit</a>. Ironically, they filmed an interview about this lawsuit with the media from inside the room they claimed they were denied access to.</p><p>The entire process was a microcosm of the current dynamic between our two parties. The GOP wants to disenfranchise and discourage and suppress democracy. The Democratic Party wants everyone to be empowered in the process and their voice and vote to matter.</p><p>My experience inside TCF only further underscored for me the work that needs to be done to fight voter suppression in America. But it also gave me hope for the future of this effort. I saw a lot of ugliness in that room, but I also saw a diverse group of people — Black and white and Asian and Hispanic, students and retirees, union reps, voting-rights activists, community organizers, people of all religions, and folks from the entire gamut of sexual identity and expression — working hard to protect the Democratic process and ensure every legal vote in that room was counted.</p><p>I entered TCF at 9 a.m. and left 15 hours later, hungry, exhausted and clear that our efforts were not the end to the process, but another step forward in the movement to ensure that in every city and every community of color across America, every vote counts.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/detroit-poll-challenger-trump-gop-voter-fraud-ballot-allegations-absurd-2020-11'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=rRZfOlP_pfU:C7x3dz6LIAQ:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=rRZfOlP_pfU:C7x3dz6LIAQ:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=rRZfOlP_pfU:C7x3dz6LIAQ:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=rRZfOlP_pfU:C7x3dz6LIAQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=rRZfOlP_pfU:C7x3dz6LIAQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=rRZfOlP_pfU:C7x3dz6LIAQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=rRZfOlP_pfU:C7x3dz6LIAQ:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=rRZfOlP_pfU:C7x3dz6LIAQ:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/rRZfOlP_pfU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 17 Nov 2020 13:28:00 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5faed3731c741f0019ac9b73?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"1b18fda02570280e5db69f35831d93d9","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn25@2020_3/2020/11/17/16-31-44-638_66b08efcd2721083.webp","destWidth":910,"destHeight":682,"sourceBytes":36184,"destBytes":36184,"author":"insider@insider.com (Ned Staebler)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5faed379402d49001924edd3?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn27@2020_3/2020/11/17/16-31-54-756_6ccb919228d134c5.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn83@2020_3/2020/11/17/16-31-54-041_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=rRZfOlP_pfU:C7x3dz6LIAQ:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn48@2020_4/2020/11/17/16-31-52-105_135113d5d42ed091.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=rRZfOlP_pfU:C7x3dz6LIAQ:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn24@2020_4/2020/11/17/16-31-50-351_40eb470201bf9bfb.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn96@2020_3/2020/11/17/16-31-50-199_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=rRZfOlP_pfU:C7x3dz6LIAQ:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn95@2020_5/2020/11/17/16-31-51-804_d53810456436a05f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/rRZfOlP_pfU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn39@2020_5/2020/11/17/16-31-54-531_92c2a66377f8a630.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605630688531},{"createdTime":"2020-11-18 00:31:28","updatedTime":"2020-11-18 00:31:28","title":"Airbnb reveals financials — A top Goldman dealmaker is leaving — Data-sharing deal","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/top-finance-stories-of-the-day-for-november-17-2020-11","description":"<figure> \n <img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fb2f1f2402d49001924f43f?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Airbnb Logo+ Stocks\" height=\"683\" width=\"910\" charset=\"\"> \n  <figcaption> \n   <p class=\"copyright\"><a href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/in-this-photo-illustration-an-airbnb-logo-seen-displayed-on-news-photo/1207431290?adppopup=true\" target=\"_blank\">Filip Radwanski/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images</a></p> \n  </figcaption> </img>\n</figure>\n<p>The long-awaited Airbnb S-1 finally dropped last night.

That's why there's been an \"<a href=\"https://www.interpol.int/en/News-and-Events/News/2020/INTERPOL-report-shows-alarming-rate-of-cyberattacks-during-COVID-19#:~:text=INTERPOL%20report%20shows%20alarming%20rate%20of%20cyberattacks%20during%20COVID%2D19,-4%20August%202020&text=An%20INTERPOL%20assessment%20of%20the,corporations%2C%20governments%20and%20critical%20infrastructure.ure.\">alarming rate</a>\" of cyberattacks during COVID-19, according to an Interpol report from August, with the most common cyberthreats being online scams and phishing, ransomware, data harvesting malware, malicious domains, and misinformation scams.</p><h2>Investing in cybersecurity tech is good for business</h2><p>Too many organizations mistakenly believe they're not a target, and that puts them at risk, said <a href=\"https://globalmedia.umgc.edu/richard-white-ph-d/\">Richard White</a>, an adjunct professor of cybersecurity information assurance at the <a href=\"https://globalmedia.umgc.edu/\">University of Maryland Global Campus</a>, \"There's no reason why any responsible business owner, regardless of size, should say, 'Cybersecurity doesn't matter to me,'\" White said.</p><p>Cyberattacks cost businesses in more ways than one. In 2019, victims lost more than $3.5 billion due to reported cybercrimes, according to the <a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/2019-internet-crime-report-released-021120\">FBI</a>. Business email compromise alone led to $1.7 billion in losses.</p><p>Businesses could lose customers, too, said <a href=\"https://www.dickinson-wright.com/our-people/sara-h-jodka?tab=0\">Sara Jodka</a>, an employment and cybersecurity attorney at law firm <a href=\"https://www.dickinson-wright.com/our-people/sara-h-jodka?tab=0\">Dickinson Wright</a>, \"[Cyberattacks can] become a customer-experience and brand-reputation issue that no amount of money can usually account for, especially if it's made public,\" Jodka said.</p><p>Consumers expect companies to protect their information. According to a 2019 survey by digital payment platform <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190917005012/en/New-Global-Research-Shows-Poor-Data-Security\">PCI Pal</a>, 83% of US consumers said they would stop doing business with a company for a few months after a data security breach, and 21% would never do business with the company again.</p><p>A company's cybersecurity program could also help with hiring and employee retention, as a company's brand increasingly factors into the decisions people make about where they want to work.&#160;&#160;</p><p>Factoring in all of these costs, White said the price of cybersecurity is \"worth its weight in gold.\" The cost of cybersecurity technology varies widely, but he said investing $10,000 to $15,000, though it may seem like a lot to some businesses, will protect your most valuable assets.</p><h2>What an ideal work-from-home setup should include</h2><p>The first step in creating a cybersafe remote-work setup is to provide employees with a laptop with the correct security configuration for access control, encryption, and a perimeter firewall, White said.</p><p>Access control refers to a two-factor (or multi-factor) way to authenticate, encrypt, and grant access to employees working from home. It requires users to provide multiple pieces of information before access is granted and protects their credentials.&#160;</p><p>Encrypting all data ensures confidentiality and privacy, and a firewall protects the network, he said, \"So you can allow access remotely and control it and monitor it.\"</p><p>A VPN (virtual private network) is also needed to secure data and ensure that it's transmitted through an encrypted path. Without a VPN, White said, \"data would move through clear text across the hostile internet, and there'd be no way to control the path that the data would take.\"</p><p>Malware scanning technology should be included to protect systems from a variety of attacks, including ransomware, Matthews added. \"If you do it effectively, that's going to stop 99+% of the problem,\" Matthews said. \"But sometimes something is so new, those tools haven't detected it yet and aren't ready to detect it.\"</p><p>A detection capability is another must for identifying problems as they happen. Early detection of a cyberattack lets you remedy the situation immediately and pinpoint exactly when your data was compromised if an attack occurs, Matthews added.</p><p>Backup and recovery technologies are vital, too. Matthews suggested relying on a \"three, two, one rule\" to protect and recover lost data. \"You need three copies of every bit of data in at least two locations, one of which is completely air-gapped,\" he said.</p><h2>Everyone within an organization must embrace cybersecurity protocol</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/21/the-biggest-cybersecurity-risk-to-us-businesses-is-employee-negligence-study-says.html\">Employee negligence</a>, such as clicking on a suspicious link, is the biggest cybersecurity risk for businesses. So for a cybersecurity program to be successful, it must be a top-down initiative with ongoing communication from the C-suite to all employees, Jodka said.</p><p>Employees also need to know who to call and what to do if they're faced with a potential cyberattack, and if there's disciplinary action for negligence. Organizations should hold regular training on cybersecurity, including testing employees' abilities to recognize phishing attempts, White said. Training should also cover industry-specific data protection regulations, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) in the healthcare sector. Regular reminders about cybersecurity will keep it fresh on everyone's mind, too.</p><p>According to <a href=\"https://www.pwc.com/us/en/library/covid-19/workforce-pulse-survey.html\">PwC's Workforce Pulse Survey</a> from July, just 30% of employees said they received training on protecting company and personal data and information, even though about 70% of technology officers said they increased cybersecurity training because of the pandemic. And 23% of employees said their organization didn't offer a \"compelling case\" for good cybersecurity practices, and less than 30% said their employer provided a device for them to use while working remotely without having to use their own personal equipment.</p><p>Data breaches from cyberattacks could land company leaders in legal trouble, Jodka said. In January 2019, former officers and directors of <a href=\"https://casetext.com/case/in-re-yahoo-inc-sholder-derivative-litig-1\">Yahoo agreed to pay $29 million</a> to settle claims that they had mishandled customer data during several cyberattacks from 2013 to 2016 that compromised three billion user accounts.</p><p>The Yahoo case \"changed the game,\" Jodka said, showing that cybercrime could be seen as a breach of the duty of care and duty of loyalty that officers and boards of directors have to their organizations.</p><p>As the transition to remote work continues, cyberthreats will likely intensify, and investing in cybersecurity to tighten security remains a critical issue for businesses of all sizes.</p><p>\"The issue is still significant as thousands and thousands of dollars continue to go out the door in response to these phishing and other schemes,\" Jodka said.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

We have voted for an end to arrogant, hawkish interventionism so many times now. By this measure, restraint is centrism. Americans generally do not want to posture the United States as a meddlesome superpower, constantly and recklessly inserting our military into situations unconnected to vital US security interests.</p><p>For the next two years, a government split between both major parties could well mean more of the failures that have defined US foreign affairs the post-9/11 era. But foreign policy should be one point on which a divided government can be united, finally giving voters the peace they keep endorsing.</p><p><em>Bonnie Kristian is a fellow at Defense Priorities, contributing editor at The Week, and columnist at Christianity Today.

Tech giants like Apple, Microsoft, and many others have been chasing what has become the Holy Grail of computing: blending the benefits of mobile devices with the processing power that comes with desktop-class machines.</p><p>Apple's ambitions here are coming into full focus with <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-m1-chip-risk-moving-away-from-intel-macbook-pro-2020-11\">the debut of the M1</a>: its first homemade processor designed to power its line of Mac computers.</p><p>The launch of its M1 chip means a few promising things for Apple loyalists. For one, the processors powering Apple's laptops and desktops will run on the same basic architecture as those inside the iPhone and iPad, enabling mobile apps from the iOS App Store to run on the Mac for the first time.</p><p>But, most important of all, Apple is guaranteeing that its M1 chip will introduce major gains in performance and power efficiency. That's already become evident after using the new $1,000 M1-powered <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=35871X943606&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-mac%2Fmacbook-airbook-air\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">MacBook Air</a> for just a few days, which is leagues ahead of Apple's Intel-powered MacBook Air when it comes to areas like performance and webcam quality.</p><p>Plus, the MacBook Air's newer fanless internal design means you'll no longer need to worry about your laptop sounding like a jet engine when it's enduring a particularly heavy workload.</p><p>Yet, it's going to take some time before we understand whether making iPhone apps compatible with the Mac brings anything new to the experience. And, even though Apple's M1 chip delivers noticeable improvements in power and efficiency, Apple's laptops still lack some of the benefits of Windows devices, like facial recognition for a more seamless login experience, borderless screens, and most importantly: touch support.</p><p>But overall, the M1-powered MacBook Air is a step up from its Intel-powered predecessor. It offers faster performance for the same price with virtually no compromises even when running apps that are not yet optimized for Apple's new silicon.</p><bi-shortcode id=\"table-of-contents-sticky\" class=\"mceNonEditable\" data-type=\"h2\">Table of Contents: Masthead Sticky</bi-shortcode><h2>Apple MacBook Air (Late 2020, M1) specifications</h2><ul><li><strong>Display:</strong> 13.3-inch Retina display (2,560 x 1,600) with True Tone</li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> 8-core Apple M1 SoC (7~8-core GPU, 16-core Neural Engine)</li><li><strong>Estimated battery life:</strong> Up to 15 hours of web browsing</li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 8GB to 16GB&#160;</li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 256GB or 512GB SSD configurable up to 2TB</li><li><strong>Ports:</strong> Two Thunderbolt 3/USB-C ports, one headphone jack</li><li><strong>Camera:</strong> 720p FaceTime camera</li><li><strong>Authentication:</strong> Touch ID fingerprint sensor</li></ul><h2>Performance</h2><p><a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=35871X943606&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-mac%2Fmacbook-airbook-air\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\"><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fb2f1461c741f0019aca215?format=jpeg\" alt=\"MacBook AIr Yellow\" height=\"750\" width=\"1000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Lisa Eadicicco/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></a></p><p>Let's start with performance, since it's one of the biggest ways in which Apple's new MacBook Air stands out from its Intel-powered predecessor.</p><p>The Apple silicon MacBook Air I've been using has eight processor cores and 8GB of RAM, while the Intel-powered version I've been testing it against has a 1.1GHz quad-core Intel core i5 processor with 8GB of RAM.</p><p>The Intel edition replaced by this model topped out at four cores, and the base model came with a dual-core Intel Core i3, which as I noted in <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-macbook-air-2020-review\">my previous review</a> felt underpowered. A processor with more cores usually means it's better at multitasking, since it has additional cores to drive multiple processes at once.</p><p>Apple claims the M1-equipped MacBook Air model offers 3.5 times the computing power, five times the graphics performance, and up to nine times the machine learning capabilities compared to the previous-generation Intel version. In other words: it should be faster when it comes to everything from gaming to editing high-resolution photos and more.&#160;</p><p>In my experience, the performance gains are most noticeable in photo editing apps and video games. When exporting 50 photos from Adobe Lightroom in full size at 100% quality, the M1-powered MacBook Air performed the task in 16.5 seconds, while the Intel version took 46.3 seconds. It was also faster at stitching together five images to create a panoramic shot: the M1 MacBook Air did so in 11.2 seconds, while the Intel edition took 19.3 seconds.</p><p>Exporting a complex image that was 1GB in size and 15,000 x 12,000 pixels — the biggest file in my Lightroom library by a long shot — only took about 30 seconds on the first try when using the M1 MacBook Air and 17 seconds on the second test. The Intel MacBook Air, by comparison, took over three minutes to export the same image file both times.</p><p>The MacBook Air isn't meant to be a gaming laptop, but the M1 version is certainly more capable than its Intel-powered counterpart. Don't expect to play games at the highest resolution on the M1 MacBook Air, but I was able to comfortably play \"Shadow of the Tomb Raider\" at a resolution of 1,900 x 1,200 without much compromise.</p><p>The Intel-equipped MacBook Air can also run the game at that same resolution, but performance is a bit stuttery in comparison, especially when panning the camera across busy scenes. The M1 MacBook Air also loaded my save slot about 13 seconds faster than the Intel version when starting the game.</p><p>Not to mention, \"Shadow of the Tomb Raider\" sent the Intel-based MacBook Air's fans whirring after less than an hour of gameplay, an issue I didn't have to worry about with the fanless M1 MacBook Air.</p><h2>Apps</h2><p><a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=35871X943606&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-mac%2Fmacbook-airbook-air\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\"><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fb2f1661c741f0019aca217?format=jpeg\" alt=\"MacBook Air Apps 2\" height=\"669\" width=\"1000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The Kitchen Stories app (left) alongside the website (right)\n<p class=\"copyright\">Business Insider/Lisa Eadicicco</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></a></p><p>Apple's decision to put its own silicon in devices like the MacBook Air combined with its most recent desktop software makes the Mac feel a bit more like the iPhone.</p><p>Big Sur, the name of Apple's most recent macOS update, introduces redesigned app icons that more closely resemble those found on the iPhone, for example, in addition to other iPhone-like features. And, the keyboard on the M1 MacBook Air features new shortcuts in the function row for features like Do Not Disturb and dictation.</p><p>But, the most significant way Apple is bridging the Mac and iPhone experience is through apps. Since the Mac's processor is now based on the same basic architecture as that of the iPhone and iPad, iOS apps are capable of running on the Mac natively. Some of the iOS apps currently available on macOS ahead of launch include games like \"Among Us\" and \"Crossy Road\" as well as Facebook, Zillow, and Kitchen Stories.</p><p>These apps run just fine on the Mac. But, it'll probably take some time for developers to make changes that elevate their apps beyond what you'd experience when using the web-based version of the app.</p><p>That's especially true considering Mac laptops don't support touch input like many Windows devices do. Apple has always maintained that its desktop and mobile ecosystems should remain separate. But, I've never wanted a touch screen on the Mac more than I have in recent years after using the iPad Pro.</p><p>Apple's top-of-the-line tablet is the best argument yet for how good a touch-centric productivity device made by Apple could be. The MacBook Air offers some of the features I loved about working on the iPad Pro — namely its fanless design, long battery life, and fast performance — but feels a bit incomplete without a touch screen. That also makes it tougher to be excited about the prospect of iPhone apps on the Mac.</p><p>Still, there are ways for mobile apps to shine on the Mac. The Kitchen Stories app is a bit sleeker than the website and dives right into the featured recipes with compelling visuals as soon as you launch the app. The website, on the other hand, prominently features articles and blog posts in addition to recipes, which is great if you're looking for stories to read but perhaps is less ideal while you're in the middle of preparing a meal.</p><p>However, most people don't buy a laptop specifically to use mobile apps. Since the M1 chip is based on a different architecture than Intel's processors, desktop programs need to be optimized for Apple's new computers. Apple is addressing this by enabling Intel-based apps to run in its Rosetta 2 emulator, which essentially means apps should be able to run normally on M1 Macs regardless of whether they've been tweaked for Apple's new chip.</p><p>During my time using the M1 MacBook Air, I could barely tell the difference between apps that were optimized for Apple's chip and those that weren't. All of the third-party apps I've been using on the new MacBook Air — Slack, Google Chrome, Microsoft Word, Cisco WebEx, Adobe Lightroom, and Skitch — have not yet been updated to be optimized for Apple silicon.</p><p>But, they ran so flawlessly on the MacBook Air that the only way I could tell they weren't optimized for the M1 chip was by looking at the Mac's Activity Monitor.</p><h2>Battery life and webcam</h2><p><a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=35871X943606&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-mac%2Fmacbook-airbook-air\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\"><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fb2fdca1c741f0019aca25c?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Apple MacBook Air half open\" height=\"750\" width=\"1000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Lisa Eadicicco/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></a></p><p>While the improvements in performance are certainly appreciated, it's the upgrade to the MacBook Air's battery life that I appreciated the most.</p><p>The MacBook Air had 10% of its battery left after 12 hours of usage that involved a mix of photo editing in Lightroom, browsing the web in both Safari and Chrome, streaming video on YouTube, and a little bit of gaming. Apple claims the new Air should last for 15 hours when browsing the web and 18 hours when playing video in Apple TV Plus.</p><p>Those results may not align precisely with Apple's claims, especially since my usage circumstances differed from Apple's tests. But, it certainly outperformed the Intel-based MacBook Air, which lasted for roughly seven hours on a single charge when I <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-macbook-air-2020-review\">reviewed it earlier this year</a>.</p><p>It's important to remember that factors like screen brightness and the specific apps you're running will always impact battery life, so your results may differ from mine.</p><p>The M1-powered MacBook Air is also getting another desperately-needed upgrade: its webcam. Apple isn't alone; built-in webcams on most laptops are nowhere near the quality of those found on our smartphones. Until 2020, that probably didn't matter much. But, now that many people have been relying on webcams for office meetings, socializing, and most likely holiday gatherings in the near future, the cameras in our laptops have taken on a new importance.</p><p>The M1 MacBook Air still has a 720p camera, but because it runs on Apple's processor it also has the company's iPhone-grade image signal processor technology. That means it should offer better noise reduction and white balance, and in my experience it lived up to these claims.</p><p>Take a look at the difference below.</p><p><strong>M1 MacBook Air</strong></p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fb2fa071c741f0019aca23d?format=jpeg\" alt=\"FaceTime Camera M1 Mac\" height=\"720\" width=\"1080\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Lisa Eadicicco/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p><strong>Intel MacBook Air</strong></p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fb2fa1a1c741f0019aca23e?format=jpeg\" alt=\"FaceTime Camera Intel Mac\" height=\"720\" width=\"1080\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Lisa Eadicicco/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>It's still not as crisp as your smartphone's camera, but it's a major leap ahead of Apple's Intel-based Mac.</p><h2>Design, display, and keyboard</h2><p><a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=35871X943606&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-mac%2Fmacbook-airbook-air\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\"><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fb2f1f61c741f0019aca21c?format=jpeg\" alt=\"MacBook Air Open\" height=\"750\" width=\"1000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Business Insider/Lisa Eadicicco</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></a></p><p>In other critical areas, like the design, display, and keyboard, the MacBook Air hasn't changed much compared to the previous Intel-powered iteration. One difference, however, is that Apple has added support for wide color into the display rather than just standard color.</p><p>That means the screen should be able to display a broader spectrum of colors compared to the earlier version of the MacBook Air, although I didn't notice this too much in daily use. It's probably more important for photo and video editors that need precise color representation in a laptop.</p><p>Unfortunately, Apple's new M1-powered laptops haven't gotten the same makeover that other products like the iPad and iPhone have received in recent years. As such, they still have thicker borders framing their display, occupying space that could have been used to expand the screen without making the laptop itself more cumbersome. It makes the design feel a bit dated compared to Windows laptops, like the Dell XPS 13.</p><p>Apple also hasn't built Face ID into the Mac yet, despite the fact that dozens of Windows laptops support Microsoft's Windows Hello feature. The new MacBook Air does have Touch ID, as does its predecessor, but facial recognition would have provided a slightly more seamless experience. And if the MacBook Air's internals are similar to those of the Intel MacBook Air from earlier this year, <a href=\"https://www.ifixit.com/News/36480/theres-something-new-in-the-macbook-air\">the RAM and SSD are probably soldered</a>, meaning they'll be tough to upgrade after the fact.&#160;</p><p>Like the other laptops Apple has released this year, the M1-powered MacBook Air has the company's new Magic Keyboard. If you've used any of the earlier laptops Apple released between 2015 and 2019, you'll definitely notice the difference.</p><p>The Magic Keyboard is less flat and offers more feedback when typing, resulting in an experience that's generally more comfortable than its previous butterfly keyboard. Those older keyboards were also more prone to damage and malfunctions than the Magic Keyboard.</p><h2>The bottom line</h2><p><a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=35871X943606&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-mac%2Fmacbook-airbook-air\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\"><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fb2f23f402d49001924f441?format=jpeg\" alt=\"MacBook Air marble background\" height=\"659\" width=\"1000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Business Insider/Lisa Eadicicco</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></a></p><p>With its longer battery life and faster performance for the same price, it's clear that Apple's new M1 chip delivers big improvements. Popular apps like Microsoft Word and Slack that haven't yet been optimized for the chip still work flawlessly on the system, meaning the laptop's viability doesn't hinge on whether or not developers update their apps.</p><p>The addition of the M1 chip is a particularly useful upgrade for a laptop like the MacBook Air, which primarily appeals to students and professionals in need of a laptop for basic work that primarily involves web browsing and word processing. The fact that it can hold its own when it comes to gaming and photo editing make it that much better.</p><p>But, Apple's approach of shying away from touch screens and flexible 2-in-1 designs make me wonder how much better the experience could be if the company were to embrace those choices, especially now that iPhone apps can run on the Mac.</p><p>The new MacBook Air is certainly a step forward, but it also would have been nice to see some of the enhancements that have arrived on the iPad and iPhone translate to the Mac — like a bigger screen and Face ID.</p><p>All told, the M1 MacBook Air is Apple's first major attempt to bring the perks of mobile devices — like all-day battery life, fanless designs, and a wider selection of apps — to its desktop operating system. The full benefits of having the iPhone and Mac run on the same architecture may not be fully realized just yet, but so far the M1 is a success in the areas that matter most like performance and battery life.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Fast performance; Super-long battery life; Much improved camera <br><strong>Cons</strong>: Lacks some features of similarly-priced Windows devices like facial recognition and a borderless screen; iPhone apps don't add much to the experience yet especially without touch screens</p><div id=\"ProductCard_5fab087019bb5e51403e5023\"

companies has corrected the UK government after it suggested that the company could simply move part of its production from the EU to Britain in the event of a no-deal Brexit, telling Business Insider that it would have to increase prices for UK consumers instead.</p><p>The UK Environment Secretary George Eustice told the BBC on Sunday that Arla, which makes the popular Lurpak brand of butter in Europe, could make the product in the UK instead to avoid costly tariffs if Britain fails to secure a trade deal with the EU by the end of the year.</p><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCPolitics/status/1327915454464204804?s=20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Eustice told BBC's Andrew Marr:</a> \"In a non-negotiated outcome, what would happen is companies like Arla, which is a big Danish company, sells brands like Lurpak in the UK that are manufactured in Denmark, they would have to relocate that production to the UK.\"</p><p>However, Ash Amirahmadi, Arla's UK Managing Director, told Business Insider that the company would not be able to move Lurpark production to the UK, as Eustice told the BBC's Marr, because it would be illegal.</p><p>\"The picture around moving products into the UK is a bit more complicated than that statement,\" he said.</p><p>\"If you take Lurpak on its own, it is subject to legal protection which means it can only be made in Denmark.</p><p>\"It can't be produced in the UK. The Secretary of State may or may not have known that.\"</p><p>He warned that tariffs on dairy products imported into the UK from abroad, like Lurpak from Denmark, would almost certainly lead to price rises in UK supermarkets and potentially a reduction in product availability.</p><p>\"We would have to pass on the cost to our customers,\" Amirahmadi told Business Insider.</p><p>\"Obviously it's not for us to tell customers what to do. But I would be very surprised if our customers didn't have to absorb the cost.

target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Black Friday 2020</a> is fast approaching and set to kick off right on time after Thanksgiving on November 27.</p><p>If you're in the market for an Apple Watch, Black Friday and Cyber Monday are two the best opportunities to buy one for a deal much less than full price.</p><p>There are three <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-watch-series-6-watch-se-price-release-date\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">models of the Apple Watch</a> that Apple is currently offering, including the Apple Watch Series 6, the Apple Watch SE, and the Apple Watch Series 3. All of them can be found for a deal at the moment in early Black Friday deals.&#160;</p><p>The $399 <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/black-friday-deals\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Apple Watch Series 6</a> is Apple's top model that comes with a new blood-oxygen sensor to measure SpO2 levels to track your overall respiratory and cardiac health. The Series 6 also runs on Apple's S6 chip that the company claims is 20% faster than the previous Series 5.&#160;</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-watch-se-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Apple Watch SE</a> is lighter on features than the Series 6, and it has a $270 MSRP that reflects as much. While it comes with core fitness tracking features and sensors, it doesn't come with the advanced health and fitness tracking sensors like an ECG or SpO2 sensor, and thus doesn't include some of the more advanced health and fitness tracking features as the Series 6. It runs on the same processor as the Series 5, giving it plenty of power for most people's needs.&#160;</p><p>Apple is still selling the 2017 <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-watch-series-3-review-1-year-later-2018-9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Apple Watch 3</a> for $199, making it an option for budget-conscious buyers to get the core Apple Watch experience.&#160;</p><p>Other Apple Watch models like the Series 5 and Series 4 can still be found, but they're not being given the Black Friday treatment as of yet.</p><h2>Early Black Friday Apple Watch deals</h2><p>Some deals exist for Apple's current Apple Watch models, like the Series 6, SE, and Series 3. They're not massive discounts, but they're in line with what we expect for Apple's coveted smartwatches during Black Friday.</p><p>Based on last year, we're not expecting deals to go much lower on Black Friday itself. For Series 5, the top model of 2019, we only saw a $20 discount on Black Friday from $429 to $409. And, Apple is already selling the Series 3 for lower than Black Friday last year, and it's available for even less now.</p><div id=\"ProductCard_5f6cfb0302495a07337f0624\" style=\"position:relative; display:block; width: 100%\"><iframe src=\"https://produktor.businessinsider.com/productCardService?id=5f6cfb0302495a07337f0624&type=medium&live=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"150%\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" style=\"position:absolute; top:0; left: 0\"></iframe></div><div id=\"ProductCard_5f848449bf96b920706aaf85\" style=\"position:relative; display:block; width: 100%\"><iframe src=\"https://produktor.businessinsider.com/productCardService?id=5f848449bf96b920706aaf85&type=medium&live=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"150%\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" style=\"position:absolute; top:0; left: 0\"></iframe></div><div id=\"ProductCard_5d35e177100a24190c405c8a\" style=\"position:relative; display:block; width: 100%\"><iframe src=\"https://produktor.businessinsider.com/productCardService?id=5d35e177100a24190c405c8a&type=medium&live=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"150%\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" style=\"position:absolute; top:0; left: 0\"></iframe></div><h2>Apple Black Friday FAQs</h2><h3><strong>Does Apple have Black Friday deals?</strong></h3><p><a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/196318/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Apple</a> itself generally doesn't offer Black Friday deals from its website or its stores, but other retailers that sell Apple products, like Walmart, Best Buy, and Amazon (as well as B&#38;H Photo and Adorama), will have discounts on a range of Apple products.

Many of these new voters are from California, Illinois, New York, New Jersey, and they're not of the conservative persuasion,\" Perdue reportedly said, adding: \"This is really not about messaging. It's not about persuasion in my race. It's more about getting the vote out.\"</p><p>Loeffler, who risks being unseated by the Democratic challenger Raphael Warnock, also said turnout would be key, telling others on the call that \"the question is about the Democrat turnout,\" The Post reported.</p><p>Victories for Ossoff and Warnock would give Democrats control of the Senate, as Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would have the tie-breaking vote in a split chamber. That would also give Democrats control of the White House, the House, and the Senate, which, in theory, would give Biden greater freedom to enact domestic policy.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/republicans-privately-call-trump-a-liability-who-lost-election-2020-11'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=eCnkWH6_e8c:aMU1kJR2piA:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=eCnkWH6_e8c:aMU1kJR2piA:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=eCnkWH6_e8c:aMU1kJR2piA:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=eCnkWH6_e8c:aMU1kJR2piA:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=eCnkWH6_e8c:aMU1kJR2piA:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=eCnkWH6_e8c:aMU1kJR2piA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=eCnkWH6_e8c:aMU1kJR2piA:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=eCnkWH6_e8c:aMU1kJR2piA:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/eCnkWH6_e8c\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 17 Nov 2020 12:32:37 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5fb3c23859ad4c2c1075a847?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"87c64a39d1591d3846a5d8fc91ce5b1f","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn76@2020_3/2020/11/17/16-31-55-654_a558f4644f404aec.webp","destWidth":1381,"destHeight":1036,"sourceBytes":46952,"destBytes":46952,"author":"apayne@businessinsider.com (Adam Payne)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5fb3c32a3ad3bb2fa0213b50?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn47@2020_1/2020/11/17/16-31-51-353_507d6cf8910d4756.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn83@2020_3/2020/11/17/16-31-54-041_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=eCnkWH6_e8c:aMU1kJR2piA:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn11@2020_5/2020/11/17/16-31-52-025_01e9f53343814cf1.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=eCnkWH6_e8c:aMU1kJR2piA:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn71@2020_6/2020/11/17/16-31-55-608_8b022f939794984a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn96@2020_3/2020/11/17/16-31-50-199_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=eCnkWH6_e8c:aMU1kJR2piA:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn83@2020_3/2020/11/17/16-31-51-600_fed70b71127b6e9c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/eCnkWH6_e8c":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn4@2020_4/2020/11/17/16-31-48-482_3803157aa4e4e6b4.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605630688557},{"createdTime":"2020-11-18 00:31:28","updatedTime":"2020-11-18 00:31:28","title":"Why won't my hotspot work?

Normally, this wouldn't be a problem — your cell phone gets good <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/category/lte\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">LTE</a> service, you can just connect your computer to your phone's mobile hotspot. But you try to connect to it and it won't work. Why?</p><p>This is a question with many possible answers, and many of them also depend on what type of phone you have.&#160;</p><h2>How to troubleshoot a hotspot that won't work</h2><p>If your mobile hotspot isn't working, run through this troubleshooting list to figure out why.</p><h3><strong>Make sure your phone's internet connection is working</strong></h3><p>Go to your phone's settings app and check to make sure your cellular data is switched on. You should also try to use the internet on your phone to make sure you're not in an area with slow or bad reception.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fb2b865402d49001924f296?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Why_won_t_my_hotspot_work_ _1\" height=\"1423\" width=\"800\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Make sure to turn your cellular data on by swiping the switch to the right, turning the button green.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Melanie Weir/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>You should also check and make sure you haven't exceeded your cellular data limit for the month — if you're on a prepaid plan with a limit, your data speeds will be throttled when you pass it, rendering your hotspot essentially useless. To solve this issue, contact your data provider.</p><h3><strong>Make sure the Wi-Fi of the device you're trying to connect to is working</strong></h3><p>If your device won't connect to your phone, it could actually be a device issue. Try connecting to your phone's hotspot with another device. If it works, the problem is likely not your phone.</p><p>Turn the Wi-Fi on your connecting device on and off and see if that fixes the problem. If not, try restarting your device. If you still have issues, you may need to take it in for repairs.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fb2b905402d49001924f29b?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Why_won_t_my_hotspot_work_ _2\" height=\"800\" width=\"896\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Try turning the Wi-Fi on your connecting device off and on again.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Melanie Weir/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><h3><strong>Make sure the password is right</strong></h3><p>If your hotspot is password protected, look at the password on your phone and make sure you've entered the password correctly on the device you're connecting with — if it's not, you won't be able to connect.</p><p>If you're still having trouble, you can also change the password to something that will be easier to enter without mistakes.</p><h3><strong>Disable battery saver or low power mode</strong></h3><p>Battery saver mode works by limiting certain non-essential functions on your phone to conserve battery life. This isn't supposed to include limiting your phone's ability to connect to a hotspot, but all software gets buggy from time to time. This is an issue that is known to occur, especially on Android.&#160;</p><p>Try turning battery saver off and see if that fixes the issue.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fb2b990402d49001924f2a0?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Why_won_t_my_hotspot_work_ _4\" height=\"800\" width=\"904\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Make sure the low power mode on your device is turned off.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Melanie Weir/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><h3><strong>Turn your phone's Wi-Fi on and off</strong></h3><p>Speaking of bugs in the system, even though your phone's Wi-Fi isn't usually the victim of them, it's not impossible for that to be the case. If it doesn't seem to be working, try switching it off and back on again and see if that fixes the issue.</p><h3><strong>Wi-Fi not working? Pair using Bluetooth or USB</strong></h3><p>Wi-Fi isn't the only way to connect devices to your phone's hotspot. You can also pair your phone and computer using <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/category/bluetooth\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bluetooth</a> or a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/category/usb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">USB</a> cable.&#160;</p><p>To connect to an <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/category/iphone\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">iPhone's</a> cellular network via Bluetooth, turn on Bluetooth on your phone, connect to it from your other device, and confirm the connection on your phone.&#160;</p><p>To connect to an <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/category/android\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Android</a> via Bluetooth or USB tethering, go to \"Settings &#62; Network and Internet &#62; Hotspot and tethering\" and toggle the relevant switch to the on position, then connect with your other device.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fb2bb031c741f0019aca07b?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Why_won_t_my_hotspot_work_ _6\" height=\"847\" width=\"800\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Try using Bluetooth or a USB connection if Wi-Fi won&#39;t work.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Melanie Weir/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><h3><strong>Try restarting your phone</strong></h3><p>Sometimes if your phone is on for too long, especially if several programs are running in the background, your phone can begin processing slower or even experiencing bugs — and it becomes more likely to happen if the battery life is low.&#160;</p><p>In that case, it's possible the problems you're experiencing with your hotspot could easily be simply solved by restarting your phone.</p><p>If you have an iPhone, this is about all you can do to fix any hotspot issues you might be having — if none of these troubleshooting options can solve your problem, it may be a bug in a software update, or you might need to take your phone in to be looked at.</p><h2>More troubleshooting options if you have an Android phone</h2><h3><strong>Roll back your software</strong></h3><p>Unlike iPhones, Android phones let you roll back software updates if you don't like them or they don't work on your phone.&#160;</p><p>Since it's possible that your hotspot issues are being caused by a bug in a software update, try going back to the older version of your OS and see if that fixes the issue. If it doesn't, you can always download the update again.</p><h3><strong>Disable automatic hotspot switching</strong></h3><p>With some newer phones, the hotspot will turn itself off if no device is connected to it for a few minutes. This might give you issues if your device goes into sleep mode, or if you leave the room and come back.</p><p>If this is your issue, go to \"Settings &#62; Network and Internet &#62; Hotspot and tethering &#62; Wi-Fi hotspot &#62; Advanced\" and switch the slider for \"Turn off hotspot automatically\" to the off position.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fb2bb8f402d49001924f2b2?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Why_won_t_my_hotspot_work_ _7\" height=\"977\" width=\"800\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Turn automatic hotspot switching off so that the toggle is no longer blue.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Melanie Weir/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><h3><strong>Create a new, open mobile hotspot</strong></h3><p>While password-protected hotspots are safer because they're encrypted, that encryption can sometimes lead to issues connecting to a hotspot. Sometimes a hotspot will work better with your device if you just leave it open.</p><p>To change your hotspot to an open network, go to \"Settings &#62; Network and Internet &#62; Hotspot and tethering &#62; Wi-Fi hotspot\" and change the Security setting to \"None.\"</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fb2bbf9402d49001924f2b7?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Why_won_t_my_hotspot_work_ _8\" height=\"963\" width=\"800\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Turn off the security to your hotspot to deal with encryption issues.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Melanie Weir/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>As a warning — this does leave you open to other people joining the network and using your cellular data, too. If you're in a public place, or are concerned about others nearby using your data, this may not be the best option.</p><h3><strong>Change the frequency band to 2.4GHz</strong></h3><p>Newer Android phones also come with the ability to change the frequency of the signal you send out to create the hotspot. While a 5GHz band is faster, many devices may not be able to pick it up, meaning you wouldn't see it listed under possible connections on the device you're trying to connect to your hotspot.</p><p>To switch back to the standard 2.4GHz band, go to \"Settings &#62; Network and Internet &#62; Hotspot and tethering &#62; Wi-Fi hotspot.\" Tap \"AP Band,\" then select 2.4GHz from the

Make it part of your company values</h2><p>A company's core values are underlying principles that guide the organization towards its goals. By setting growth as one of your business core values, you won't only attract employees with similar mindsets, but also inspire experienced team members to pass on their skills and knowledge to others.</p><h2>2. Bring in speakers</h2><p>Doing this regularly is the perfect way to break out of the office's daily routine. Guest speakers can share valuable experiences that inspire your team and bring a fresh perspective to the workplace.&#160;</p><h2>3. Set aside self-learning time</h2><p>Between excelling at work and dealing with home life, it's difficult for people to find&#160;time they can completely dedicate to self-improvement. Setting aside even a couple hours a week for employees to take an online course or explore new software can make a huge difference.</p><p>Give your employees the time and tools they need to learn by themselves, and you will have a more confident and motivated team. It's also easy to do and costs you nothing.</p><h2>4. Organize employee-led workshops</h2><p>Employee-led workshops can provide team members with useful hacks and insights. These activities can also enhance the sense of community between team members. By learning from doers, employees will have a more comprehensive understanding of new technologies.</p><p><em><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/linkedin-3-ways-create-learning-culture-within-company-2020-7\">Learning new skills is the key to helping workers stay happy and productive right now.

Implement monthly one-on-ones</h2><p>One-on-ones allow honest and transparent communication&#160;between managers and team members. From setting expectations and giving feedback to chatting and clearing up doubts, they can keep your employees motivated and focused on the company's goals.</p><p>To get to know your team better and help them develop, provide them with constructive feedback through monthly one-on-ones. Then, create development goals with them to guide their growth.</p><h2>6. Start a training-and-development department</h2><p>Creating a strong learning culture requires long-term planning, resources&#160;and expertise. The methods mentioned above are free, but once you're ready to invest in training, you can create a department dedicated to growth. Besides implementing training programs, this department can work on measuring the overall performance of the company and developing strategies to improve.</p><p>Training-and-development opportunities can change your employees and your business for the better. Besides being more productive, employees feel more appreciated, confident and loyal. Meanwhile, ongoing training has long-term positive effects on performance, allowing your business to outperform the competition&#160;— which is ultimately the goal of any and all of these approaches.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/ways-to-foster-supportive-learning-environment-at-work-2020-11'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=3khoWwdXIKE:IcJXMhEKt50:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=3khoWwdXIKE:IcJXMhEKt50:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=3khoWwdXIKE:IcJXMhEKt50:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=3khoWwdXIKE:IcJXMhEKt50:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=3khoWwdXIKE:IcJXMhEKt50:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=3khoWwdXIKE:IcJXMhEKt50:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=3khoWwdXIKE:IcJXMhEKt50:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=3khoWwdXIKE:IcJXMhEKt50:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/3khoWwdXIKE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 17 Nov 2020 14:05:00 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5f919db1212113001874025f?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"5afe268526e99cabcff72aaa0d28be47","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn82@2020_6/2020/11/17/16-31-44-445_a8efae2f5da02300.webp","destWidth":2666,"destHeight":2000,"sourceBytes":134238,"destBytes":134238,"author":"insider@insider.com (JC Hite)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5e4c001d2dae5c45f666d109?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn72@2020_5/2020/11/17/16-31-45-686_c35640b9f85c899c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn83@2020_3/2020/11/17/16-31-54-041_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=3khoWwdXIKE:IcJXMhEKt50:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn16@2020_6/2020/11/17/16-31-50-296_cc60227fb2078a79.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=3khoWwdXIKE:IcJXMhEKt50:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn8@2020_1/2020/11/17/16-31-53-497_72ba3e0f790d148b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn96@2020_3/2020/11/17/16-31-50-199_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=3khoWwdXIKE:IcJXMhEKt50:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn80@2020_3/2020/11/17/16-31-53-433_067b4919ba781ab7.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/3khoWwdXIKE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn34@2020_5/2020/11/17/16-31-44-245_32628a2d5fd07109.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605630688536},{"createdTime":"2020-11-18 00:31:28","updatedTime":"2020-11-18 00:31:28","title":"Elon Musk's wealth rockets by $15 billion on Tesla's S&P 500 entrance.

according to the Census Bureau. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg expected sales to increase by 0.5%. The reading also marked an decline from September's 1.6% increase.</p><p>The October report does, however, mark the sixth straight jump in retail spending since consumer spending froze in April. Stimulus measures including the $2.2 trillion CARES Act fueled a V-shaped rebound through the summer as households' balance sheets were bolstered by direct payments and expanded unemployment benefits. Spending still sits well above pre-pandemic levels, but the mild pace of improvement signals its recent strength might be waning.</p><p><em><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/multifamily-real-estate-investing-strategy-affordable-housing-units-evan-holladay-2020-11\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">30 years old with a piece of 300 units: Here's how Evan Holladay is filling a unique multifamily real-estate niche with an under-the-radar strategy</a></em></p><p>Any slowdown would have serious effects on the broad recovery. Retail spending accounts for 70% of economic activity, and after record gross domestic product growth in the third quarter, growth is expected to slow significantly through the end of the year. The next few months also mark a make-or-break point for retailers, as the holiday season fuels the busiest spending months of the year.</p><p>Spiking COVID-19 cases place critical fourth-quarter spending at serious risk. The US reported 148,532 new cases on Monday, bringing the total number of infections above 11 million, according to <a href=\"https://covidtracking.com/data\">The COVID Tracking Project</a>.

President Donald Trump urged Congress to pass a \"<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-congress-big-focused-coronavirus-relief-bill-2020-11\">big and focused</a>\" relief bill in a Saturday tweet, but major areas of difference remain between Democrats and Republicans.</p><p>White House negotiations with Democrats on a new package dissolved ahead of November's elections. Senate Majority Mitch McConnell now leads talks on stimulus, and his prior calls for a $500 billion bill square off with Democrats' urges for a sweeping $2.2 trillion measure.</p><p>A Biden administration may be able to reach a compromise, but that punts stimulus into the new year.

href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>A new study from Oxford University suggests video games could have a positive influence on people's wellbeing.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://psyarxiv.com/qrjza/\">study</a>, conducted by the Oxford Internet Institute, focused on two games — \"<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/animal-crossing-new-horizons-on-track-to-be-best-selling-switch-game-2020-11\">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a>\" and \"Plants vs Zombies: Battle for Neighborville.\" The study involved 3,274 gamers over the age of 18.</p><p>Working in tandem with the games' creators, Nintendo for Animal Crossing and EA for Plants vs Zombies, the study tracked the amount of time survey respondents spent in-game, and combined this with a survey of players' mental wellbeing.</p><p>\"Contrary to many fears that excessive game time will lead to addiction and poor mental health, we found a small positive relation between game play and wellbeing,\" the study found.&#160;</p><p>Study lead Professor Andrew Przybylski told Business Insider this was a major step forward for research into the psychological effect of playing video games. Previously, studies have relied on asking subjects to estimate how much time they spend playing, which can be unreliable, he said.</p><p>For this study, Nintendo and EA reached out to regular players of their games to invite them to take part in the study. Respondents were then assigned a unique identifier key code, which they plugged in when completing the Oxford survey.</p><p>Oxford then sent the keys back to Nintendo and EA, who in turn released the player data. \"That way, like nobody had both parts of the puzzle,\" said Przybylski.</p><p>\"This study actually has us looking over the shoulder of gamers with a stopwatch,\" Przybylski said.</p><p>He added that reaching out to subjects via Nintendo and EA was helpful, as previous studies have searched for respondents on places like Reddit and gaming addiction forums, which increases the possibility that problem gamers make up part of the sample.</p><p>Przybylski emphasized that the study was not definitive, and came with major caveats. \"This is two games out of a million […] these are social video games, and this is just a correlation,\" he said.</p><p>He described the study as a \"baby step\" towards better methodologies for studying gaming, and emphasised that purely studying time spent in-game was not enough to gain a proper understanding of gaming.</p><p>\"It would be like studying nutrition if all you have was the amount of time that people spent in restaurants,\" he said.</p><p>He's hopeful, however, that the study will be a good proof-of-concept, and could lead to more co-operation between academics and the gaming industry, leading to better studies of gaming behaviors.</p><p>\"There's a wide range of pro-social and antisocial behaviors that happen in games, and there's a wide range of positive and negative experiences that we might be more or less likely to get into if we're having a good or a bad day,\" he said.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/video-games-mental-health-gaming-wellbeing-oxford-study-research-2020-11'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=XBAwtB6fINs:hl7R7dFIyBE:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=XBAwtB6fINs:hl7R7dFIyBE:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=XBAwtB6fINs:hl7R7dFIyBE:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=XBAwtB6fINs:hl7R7dFIyBE:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=XBAwtB6fINs:hl7R7dFIyBE:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=XBAwtB6fINs:hl7R7dFIyBE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=XBAwtB6fINs:hl7R7dFIyBE:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=XBAwtB6fINs:hl7R7dFIyBE:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/XBAwtB6fINs\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 17 Nov 2020 16:17:09 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5efb8e70aee6a823ad1dc080?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"5d44592c693023d47ac02d82755c51c0","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn57@2020_3/2020/11/17/16-31-29-623_9c4e466370b95569.webp","destWidth":1440,"destHeight":1080,"sourceBytes":52892,"destBytes":52892,"author":"insider@insider.com (Isobel Asher Hamilton)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5efb8e70aee6a823ad1dc080?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn57@2020_3/2020/11/17/16-31-29-623_9c4e466370b95569.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn83@2020_3/2020/11/17/16-31-54-041_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=XBAwtB6fINs:hl7R7dFIyBE:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn15@2020_5/2020/11/17/16-31-52-901_8a9a2e6813739083.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=XBAwtB6fINs:hl7R7dFIyBE:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn43@2020_6/2020/11/17/16-31-52-179_421eb45254009baa.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn96@2020_3/2020/11/17/16-31-50-199_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=XBAwtB6fINs:hl7R7dFIyBE:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn32@2020_2/2020/11/17/16-31-55-329_8bb7c85e74b827dd.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/XBAwtB6fINs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn55@2020_1/2020/11/17/16-31-46-420_3f46e898b55f995c.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605630688584},{"createdTime":"2020-11-18 00:31:28","updatedTime":"2020-11-18 00:31:28","title":"I'm a chess grandmaster who's made over $280,000 from esports tournaments.

I'm an esport athlete and chess grandmaster. I've been playing computer games since I was eight years old, and I was just signed by USA esport giant TSM as its first esport chess player.</p><p>My stepfather and brother are both chess players and my interest started when I followed them to tournaments.

I played games like Mario Kart with the old cartridges, but it wasn't until 1998 that I had my first real introduction to PC games, with StarCraft: Brood War. I also played chess online, but I didn't start playing it seriously until much later.</p><p>In 2018, I started streaming on the gaming platform Twitch, where people also broadcast themselves playing games like Fortnite and Call of Duty. Currently, my Twitch channel <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/gmhikaru\">GMHikaru</a> has over 570,000 followers.</p><p><em><strong>Read more</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/tv-networks-have-hard-time-getting-young-viewers-watch-sports-2020-5\">Older fans may leap back into watching sports on TV post-pandemic, but networks are going to have a tougher time winning back younger viewers</a></em></p><h2><strong>In August 2020, I signed with esports organization TSM as its first esports chess player.</strong></h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5faae241f7d1cb0019e3ae7d?format=jpeg\" alt=\"credit_Hikaru Nakamura jersey\" height=\"891\" width=\"1188\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Nakamura wears this esports jersey when competing under TSM.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Hikaru Nakamura</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>TSM is one of the world's largest esports organizations with teams playing games such as League of Legends, Fortnite, and Valorant.

However, at the moment, like everyone else, I'm working from home.</p><p>The one big change to my life during COVID-19 is my transition from a professional chess player to a full-time streamer. Ironically, I cut down on my traditional over the board competitions in the beginning of 2020, as I was a little burned out and wanted to refocus on defending my US Championship Title.</p><p>I only played in a few events from October 2019 through March 2020 when everything got shut down. Lockdown has allowed me to focus full time on streaming and share the game of chess with the Twitch audience.</p><h2><strong>The biggest misconception about chess in esports is that it's less prestigious than the board game.</strong></h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5faae0ee1df1d50018219f51?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Hikaru Nakamura Eric Rosen\" height=\"2745\" width=\"3660\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Nakamura and fellow Twitch streamer Eric Rosen.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Eric Rosen</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>People might not realize that online chess has been around since 1993, which predates almost all other esports. While traditional games can take up to five hours, online chess games move at a blistering pace and can be completed in as quickly as 10 minutes.</p><p>Fans are now becoming aware of the expertise that's needed, such as mouse skills, which are extremely important when players have only seconds left on the clock.&#160;</p><p>Other elements that you get in the esports game, which you don't get with the board game, is the ability to pre-move and make moves in 0.1 seconds. This makes it a big pull for fans as it's very viewer friendly.</p><h2><strong>On an average day when I'm not competing, I'll stream for four to seven hours.</strong></h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5faae2cb1df1d50018219f6e?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Hikaru Nakamura streaming_\" height=\"1011\" width=\"1348\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Nakamura streams live games, analysis, and interactive games on Twitch.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Hikaru Nakamura</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>I wake up around 6 a.m., boot up my stream around 8 a.m., and stream sometimes until 3 p.m. I play chess, give analysis, and invite some of my subscribers to play against me to make my streams interactive.</p><p>After that, I usually take an hour or two to clear my head while uploading VODs (videos on demand) so that my video editing team can work on the content and upload it to YouTube.</p><p>From there, I usually try to discuss content ideas or what the plans are for the next couple of streams before zoning out and reading a book or watching Netflix and going to sleep around 10 p.m.</p><p><em><strong>Read more</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/started-own-sports-agency-now-represent-8-top-wnba-stars-2020-10\">I started my own sports agency when I was 22 and now represent 8 top WNBA stars — including the legendary Lisa Leslie.

Once I've finished, I'll do a couple of hours of streaming to discuss my games and review the moves that I made. After that, I'll head to bed around 9 p.m.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.esportsearnings.com/players/75837-hikaru-nakamura\">I've played</a> in six major online competitions so far in 2020, and I'll play at least two more before the end of the year.</p><p>I generally try to eat an energy-packed meal like pasta before a stream, since it can go on for hours without a break. If I'm behind schedule, I'll usually eat a couple of breakfast bars and survive on coffee. I've never been overly superstitious when it comes to competitions, but from time to time, I will wear the same shirt multiple days if I had a great game.</p><h2><strong>As a streamer, the days tend to blur together, so I very rarely pay attention to whether it's a weekday or the weekend.</strong></h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5faae1e3f7d1cb0019e3ae78?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Credit_Eric Rosen 2 Hikaru Nakamura\" height=\"2333\" width=\"3111\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Nakamura says his weekends and weekdays tend to blur together when he&#39;s playing online.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Eric Rosen</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Since I tend to stream six or even seven days of the week, it makes no difference to me. I try to take one day off a week and go hiking in Topanga National Park in California.</p><p>As of right now, there are no meet-and-greet with fans, although I hope to hold one after we get through this trying period of time. Still, I enjoy connecting with people when I'm streaming or through social media. I post about upcoming streams on Twitter or share shots on Instagram when I'm hiking.</p><p>My wildest esports experience was when I was the No. 1 most watched channel on the streaming platform Twitch, and I wasn't even playing. It was when I was a commentator on a match in May 2020 between XQC (Felix Lengyel) and the late Reckful (Byron Bernstein) who was a good friend of mine.</p><p>Since the pandemic, the popularity of chess esports has rocketed and this growing fan base on Twitch helps tremendously. I don't really use any mental tricks in terms of staying level headed before competitions, but I do find that knowing that I have such a large audience of fans who will support me whether I win or lose makes a world of difference.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/millennials-killing-industries-decade-wealth-2020-1\">millennials had a reputation for ruining things</a>, then they haven't seen Generation Z yet.&#160;</p><p>A new BofA Global Research primer on Gen Z entitled \"OK Zoomer\" revealed that the generation born between 1996 and 2016 could spell trouble for numerous industries, including automobiles, alcohol, and shopping malls. For the report, Bank of America polled over 14,500 people over the age of 16 in the US, UK, France, Japan, Germany, South Korea, China, India, Mexico, and Brazil. The poll was conducted via SurveyMonkey in August 2020.</p><p>The trouble has to do with Gen Z's values, which differ significantly from previous cohorts, with major implications for future spending. Sustainability, tech-savviness, and activism have taken hold, posing risks to lots of things the economy produces in huge quantities.&#160;</p><p>For example, BofA found that 31% of Gen Zers believe going into debt for a car is unnecessary, compared to about 25% of millennials. Furthermore, while 41% of millennials said they were thinking about buying a car next year, only 31% of 18-to-24-year-olds said the same thing.&#160;</p><p>BofA predicts Gen Z's global income will grow to $33 trillion in 2030, eventually surpassing that of millennials in 2031.&#160;</p><p>This economic spending power means Gen Zers have a sizeable influence over the industries they wish to invest in and keep around. Right now, those deemed safe include luxury, eCommerce, and big technology platforms.

Indeed, the number of teenagers obtaining driver's licenses is slowly falling, the report said, from 69.3% in 1978 to 51.7% in 2011.&#160;</p><p>Thirty-one percent of Gen Zers polled said they found car debt to be unnecessary, with 60% saying they didn't mind using shared mobility services.&#160;</p><p>Furthermore, 31% of Gen Zers said they were fine with the possibility of having a robot drive them, compared to just 13% of boomers.

empowerment called <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/master-your-money\">Master your Money</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>Uncertainty should be in the running for buzzword of 2020.</p><p>The pandemic hit Americans unexpectedly and hard, resulting in millions of job layoffs, an especially turbulent stock market, and more talk of \"stimulus\" than most of us had heard in a decade.</p><p>Now we're experiencing the beginning of <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/k-shaped-economic-recovery-chart-low-wage-workers-pandemic-economy-2020-10\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">an economic recovery</a> that widens the gap between workers at the top and bottom of the pay scale.</p><p>According to Business Insider and Insider Intelligence's \"Master Your Money Invest &#38; Thrive Survey,\" which was conducted in July and sampled 2,020 millennials (defined as ages 21 to 38), nearly 20% of respondents said they didn't feel secure in their financial situation.</p><p>About 22% said they felt somewhat secure, 32% feel moderately secure, 17% feel very secure, and 10% feel extremely secure.</p><p>Perhaps the meaning of financial security has changed for you during this crisis, but one truth remains: If you can afford to, saving money is always a good idea.</p><h2><strong>Saving money isn't always easy, but it's necessary</strong></h2><p>The \"Invest &#38; Thrive\" survey also found that millennials often think they don't make enough money to save and, therefore, enough to invest. From a simple numbers perspective, you can afford to save money if your household's basic necessities — food, shelter, healthcare — are covered and there's money left over.</p><p>But it's worth noting even for people who have money left over, there are psychological factors at play too. Socking away money for an unknown crisis, instead of spending the cash on a dinner out with friends or flights to see family, might feel like too much of a sacrifice at the moment.&#160;</p><p>Plus, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/money-mistake-recover-financial-plan-2020-7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">research shows</a> that many of us suffer from present bias, the tendency to overemphasize the importance of today's needs and wants and underemphasize events or expenses in the future.</p><p>Still, a cash reserve that's kept out of financial markets and easily accessible is the foundation on which financial security can exist. Without one, all it takes is one unplanned expense or job loss to throw you off course.</p><h2><strong>Financial security is built on savings, and even contributes to overall happiness</strong></h2><p>While an <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/how-much-money-to-save-in-emergency-fund-rules\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">emergency fund</a> may not rescue you from every crisis — particularly if it lasts beyond the expert-recommend three to six months of cash savings — it is still your first line of defense.</p><p>When asked if they had an <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/emergency-fund-more-important-than-ever-during-economic-crisis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">emergency fund</a>, 57% of the millennial survey respondents said yes. Separately, when asked how much they were putting into a savings account each month, 25% said they didn't have a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/what-are-the-best-savings-accounts-right-now\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">savings account</a> and another 5% said they were not saving any money.</p><p>Yet everyone needs a bail-out fund. Not only does it protect your financial health, it improves your mental health too.</p><p>In <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2017/10/get-rid-of-everything/543384/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">an interview with The Atlantic</a>, New York Times best-selling author and happiness researcher Dan Buettner said financial security \"really does deliver more happiness over time than most anything that money can be spent on — after your needs are taken care of and you maybe treat yourself occasionally.\"</p><p>In 2010, while promoting his book \"Thrive: Finding Happiness The Blue Zones Way,\" Buettner <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2010/11/28/131571885/how-to-thrive-dan-buettner-s-secrets-of-happiness\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">told NPR</a> that actions such as buying insurance and — yes — signing up for an automatic savings plan are hallmarks of financial security, which has \"three times greater impact on our happiness than just income alone.\"&#160;</p><p>And remember that no amount is too small when it comes to saving money. If you have to build your emergency fund $10 at a time, it's far better than nothing.&#160;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

feed your dog, you probably head to the pantry and open up a bag of dry kibble or a can of wet food. While there are plenty of <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-dog-food\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">high-quality commercial dog foods</a> on the market, this type of food has its limitations.</p><p>The process through which traditional dog food is made often strips away the original nutritional integrity, and most brands design their foods to provide for only the most basic nutritional needs of dogs in certain life stages and different breed sizes.</p><p>Each dog is unique, and so are their nutritional needs. Fresh dog food companies offer customized meals that cater to a dog's unique nutritional profile. That's what fresh food from <a href=\"https://thefarmersdog.otegtm.net/AerNj\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow nofollow nofollow sponsored\">The Farmer's Dog</a> has to offer.</p><p>When I opened my home to a new companion — a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel puppy I named Archie — I selected a popular dog food brand that offered a small-breed puppy formula and called it a day. Archie is the kind of dog that will eat anything that falls on the floor or anything I offer him by hand.</p><p>When it comes to eating from his own bowl, however, he can be a little picky. Most days he doesn't show any interest in his food until one of my cats tries to eat it. So, when I was given the opportunity to try <a href=\"https://thefarmersdog.otegtm.net/AerNj\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener nofollow nofollow nofollow sponsored\">The Farmer's Dog fresh food</a>, I was interested to see how he would like it.</p><p>Before I get into the details, I want to point out that The Farmer's Dog is not the only fresh food service available to dog owners. We've also tried products from <a href=\"http://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=999&u=1088116&m=75374&afftrack=biipf_011320_farmers-dog-review&urllink=www.petplate.com%2F.petplate.com%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener nofollow nofollow sponsored\">PetPlate</a> and <a href=\"https://olliepets.sjv.io/eoOKX\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Ollie</a>, so I'll be mentioning my experience with them as a point of comparison.</p><h2>How the signup process works</h2><p>The first step in testing <a href=\"https://thefarmersdog.otegtm.net/AerNj\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener nofollow nofollow nofollow sponsored\">The Farmer's Dog</a> food was to create an online profile for myself and Archie using the company website. The whole process took less than five minutes.</p><p>I plugged in basic information such as my name, email address, and zip code along with some facts about Archie including his sex, age, weight, and breed. From there, I was asked to evaluate his body composition, activity level, and eating preferences. After plugging in the necessary information, I learned that Archie needs roughly 460 calories per day.</p><p><a href=\"https://thefarmersdog.otegtm.net/AerNj\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow nofollow nofollow nofollow sponsored\"><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5b1e96821ae66249008b4f26?format=jpeg\" alt=\"15390970_1173550359399937_7011280303773039205_n\" height=\"720\" width=\"960\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">The Farmer&#39;s Dog</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></a></p><p>After completing Archie's profile, I was given three formulas to choose from: turkey, beef, or pork. With my background in pet nutrition, I decided to steer clear of the beef option due to its risk for triggering food allergies and selected the turkey formula. In addition to turkey as the main ingredient, this recipe also included other nutritious ingredients like parsnips, chickpeas, carrots, broccoli, spinach, and fish oil. Each of the three recipes also includes something called \"Farmer's Dog Nutrient Blend\" to ensure balanced nutrition.</p><p>After placing my order, the product arrived quickly and in perfect condition. Packed with dry ice to keep the product frozen, the food was preportioned in bags that contained enough food for one day. All I had to do was thaw the first bag and put the rest in the freezer. The bags themselves were frozen flat so they took up minimal space in my already jam-packed freezer.</p><h2>What it's like to feed</h2><p>My shipment came with what looked like a takeout container with a plastic lid, so I was able to fold up the open food bag and place it in the container in the fridge until dinner time. I found it a little disappointing that the bags themselves were not resealable — I needed to cut them open with scissors.</p><p>Once the product thawed, I began incorporating it into Archie's diet. I followed the included instructions to mix some of the fresh food with his dry food, working up to feeding him half a bag twice a day. While I found the food bags easy to freeze, once they were open it was a little bit tricky to store them.</p><p>When I offered Archie his first bowl of The Farmer's Dog food, he was a little cautious. He spent a couple of seconds sniffing it with interest and then sampled a bite. He didn't act overly excited about the food, but he did seem to find it more appealing than his regular dry food alone. Over the next few days, as I phased out the kibble and began feeding him the fresh food only, he continued to enjoy it.</p><p>During the first few days of feeding Archie his new fresh food, he experienced some mild diarrhea. It isn't unusual for his stools to change a little in consistency from one day to the next (he likes to sneak mouthfuls of cat food whenever he can), so I wasn't worried.</p><h2>What makes it stand out</h2><p>After a few days of solely feeding Archie <a href=\"https://thefarmersdog.otegtm.net/AerNj\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow nofollow nofollow nofollow sponsored\">The Farmer's Dog</a> food, his bowel movements became more solid and regular. He also became a little more interested in eating at mealtime rather than ignoring the food for a couple of hours before eating it. Overall, I was very pleased with <a href=\"https://thefarmersdog.otegtm.net/AerNj\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener nofollow nofollow nofollow sponsored\">The Farmer's Dog</a> fresh food, and Archie seemed to like it as well.</p><p>There were three protein options to choose from (Pet Plate and Ollie currently offer four) and found the flat food bags easier to freeze and store than the larger containers Ollie food came in. The fact that each bag contained enough food for one day was also very convenient because it enabled me to keep the food as fresh as possible.</p><p>On the downside, I had to throw away several portions when Archie didn't eat them right away because my house doesn't have air conditioning, and I was worried about the food going bad. Also, while at first I didn't like the fact that the food bags were not resealable, I got used to using the storage container, and it didn't end up being a significant inconvenience.</p><h3><a href=\"https://thefarmersdog.otegtm.net/AerNj\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow nofollow nofollow nofollow sponsored\"><strong><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5b1fc0eb1ae66223008b4c3a?format=jpeg\" alt=\"1\" height=\"600\" width=\"800\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">The Farmer&#39;s Dog</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></strong></a></h3><h2>The bottom line</h2><p>The fact of the matter is that fresh food will always be the best option for your dog when it comes to quality nutrition. You need to be careful when selecting a fresh food product, however, to ensure that your dog isn't allergic or sensitive to any of the ingredients and to make sure that the formula is backed by board-certified veterinary nutritionists.</p><p>If you can't afford the high price tag of fresh food from <a href=\"https://thefarmersdog.otegtm.net/AerNj\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener nofollow nofollow nofollow sponsored\">The Farmer's Dog</a>, you have the option of using the product as a food topper instead of your dog's sole source of nutrition. By mixing a little of the fresh food with their kibble you can boost their daily nutrition without draining your bank account.</p><p>If you want to improve your dog's nutrition (and their health by extension) and you're considering fresh food, we wholeheartedly recommend <a href=\"https://thefarmersdog.otegtm.net/AerNj\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener nofollow nofollow nofollow sponsored\">The Farmer's Dog</a>.</p><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Fresh food customized to your dog, unprocessed ingredients; recipes by board-certified veterinary nutritionists comply with AAFCO standards; cooked in human-grade kitchens; convenient shipping; packaged as daily portions</p><p><strong>Cons:&#160;</strong> Limited protein options, especially for dogs with food allergies or sensitivities; bags are not resealable; may cause&#160;digestive upset during the transition from dry food to fresh food; fresh food may go bad if not eaten immediately, expensive</p><h3><a

chief executive Elon Musk as one of the richest people in the world.</p><p>As of Tuesday's opening bell, when the electric automaker's stock gained as much as 12%, Musk's wealth rose $11.8 billion to

We expect each Amazon and its competition to <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/stores-that-price-match\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">price-match each other</a> during Cyber Monday.&#160; Shoppers can expect big savings on digital content, streaming media players, smart home products, and more.&#160;</p><p>In fact, there's a good chance we can see a repeat of what we saw during <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-prime-day-best-deals\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Prime Day</a>. We expect to see several Amazon-branded goods and Echo devices see lows similar to those found last month.&#160;</p><p>During Cyber Monday, shoppers should pay attention to two types of deals: daily deals and <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-prime-day-lightning-deals-2020\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"100\" data-uri=\"27d5cc920c2bfffa9c7d4bdc485de798\">Lightning deals</a>. The former are one-day offers, usually grouped by brand or category, and change at the end of the day. The latter are limited-stock offers released throughout the day. We expect to see the best deals to come in the Lightning deal form.&#160;</p><h2>Should I get Amazon Prime?</h2><p>Amazon Prime subscribers will get the most out of Amazon's Cyber Monday. We've found that shoppers can make up the cost of the subscription with their savings from shipping alone.

Kelly was in town from the East Coast to teach a class.</p><p>After the class ended, Brody, who is a Black woman, said she changed out of her workout clothes and put a bandana on her head. When she passed Kelly in the studio, she said, he laughed and said \"Whoa — Aunt Jemima!\" in an apparent reference to the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/aunt-jemima-is-changing-its-name-mascot-over-racial-stereotype-2020-6\">syrup and pancake brand</a>.</p><p>\"That he felt OK calling me 'Aunt Jemima' in the middle of a studio lobby in Palo Alto was disgusting,\" Brody recently told Business Insider. Brody said she told a couple of instructors of color about Kelly's remark, but she didn't officially report it because, she believed, \"There wasn't anyone who would have cared.\"</p><p>\"SoulCycle kind of turned the cheek on a lot of stuff as long as they were making money,\" Brody added.</p><p>While SoulCycle instructors were fawned over by riders and the company's top brass, insiders said inappropriate behavior became more commonplace as SoulCycle's cult following grew.</p><p>While top-tier talent was lavished with perks like Soho House memberships and, in one case, a Mercedes-Benz while teaching in the Hamptons, insiders said some of SoulCycle's most successful instructors discriminated against a pregnant woman, fat-shamed employees, slept with riders, and used homophobic and racist language.</p><p>Business Insider spoke with more than 30 SoulCycle insiders — including current and former riders, studio staff, instructors, and corporate employees — many of whom accused SoulCycle of turning a blind eye to egregious behavior because the instructors were too valuable to let go of.&#160;</p><h2><a

Several cities reinstated partial lockdown measures over the past week to curb community spread, reviving concerns of a double-dip recession.</p><p>Still, 91% of respondents expect the economy to grow

Insider to <strong data-stringify-type=\"bold\">unpack their strong sales during the pandemic &#8212; and how that</strong> led to the launch of their first kid's collection.&#160;</li>\n<li>A nimble approach to manufacturing helped, as did taking seriously customer feedback &#8212; especially about getting rid of that mesh lining.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>Just before the pandemic hit the US, in February, Business Insider <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/fair-harbor-sustainable-swimsuit-line-recycled-plastic-bottles-2020-06\">spoke to Jake Danehy, 26, and his sister Caroline, 23</a>, the cofounders of Fair Harbor, a brand that turns recycled water bottles into clothing.</p><p>At the time of our first conversation, Fair Harbor's business was booming. It was on track to recycle over 3 million water bottles by 2021 and it had launched the <a href=\"https://www.fairharborclothing.com/pages/custom-round-trip-initiative\">Round Trip Initiative,</a> a program where the company takes any old swimsuits from its customers in exchange for a discount code for future Fair Harbor purchases.&#160;</p><p>After spending five years scaling the business and opening pop-up shops throughout the country, the Danehy siblings told Business Insider they were reporting almost 1,000% year-over-year growth.</p><p>But then, of course, the pandemic hit, and the world started to spin.&#160;</p><p>Retailers shut down and people were no longer traveling. The menswear category, Fair Harbor's specialty, <a href=\"https://www.stackline.com/news/top-100-gaining-top-100-declining-e-commerce-categories-march-2020\">went into a steep decline</a>, with Stackline reporting that the category saw a 64% decrease in demand in March. This meant the Fair Harbor duo were quickly forced to find a new way to market themselves to consumers. Surely this whole situation would have caused a dent somewhere in their business, right?&#160;</p><p>Hardly, Jake tells Business Insider. Sales figures in the months following the pandemic up through June, reviewed by Business Insider, were up 1,200% year-over-year, and their overall rate of near-1,000% year-over-year growth has remained steady. They have been doing so much business these past few months, that they went ahead and launched their kid's' line. It already has 20,000 on its waiting list.&#160;</p><h2><strong>\"We've had to keep our heads down, stay creative, and stay incredibly nimble and agile\"&#160;</strong></h2><p>Fair Harbor wasn't impacted much by the manufacturing closures during the pandemic, the cofounders said. One of the factories they use is \"nimble\" and found ways to open up safety, while the other one they use is part of a conglomerate, which allowed them to shift some of their production from China to another facility in Southeast Asia.&#160;&#160;</p><p>\"We were able to get our goods on time and stay up to date. We did run out of inventory in the middle of June, but that wasn't a factory issue,\" Jake said. \"We were able to take advantage of the market that was working for us and get behind it.\"</p><p>Jake said the company has spent the entire summer \"off to the races\" and that April was their best month to date in terms of sales, which then doubled in May. Then June \"was awesome.\"&#160;&#160;</p><p>\"It's been an incredibly exciting journey, we've had to keep our heads down, stay creative and stay incredibly nimble and agile,\" he continued.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5ec405703f737063c92249c9?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Fair Harbor\" height=\"4916\" width=\"6555\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>A swimwear trunk from Fair Harbor.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Fair Harbor</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Their company started off focusing solely on men's swimsuits, but Jake and Caroline said they are now interested in creating shorts that can be used for \"all different things\" and have been using these past few months to show that their products go beyond just men's swimwear.&#160;</p><p>\"We really wanted to have kid's products for the holidays,\" she continued. \"Since we started the company, we have always strived to evolve into a full lifestyle company and provide products for every member of the family. Kid's is our first expansion into that.\"</p><p>The duo said they have also been spending the entire summer ensuring that the quality of their kid's collection matches up with their men's. For example, they once had to redesign a few of their men's pieces, adding a boxer brief lining, after some customers complained that the mesh lining felt like having a \"cheese grater\" in their pants.&#160;</p><p>\"Men hate mesh lining,\" Jake said. \"We have heard from our customers that mesh lining has literally ruined vacations.\"&#160;</p><p>Neither of them wanted the children wearing their new kid's collection to go through that.&#160;</p><p>\"These stories that women and men are telling us about the irritation and the chafing, it sounds horrible,\" Caroline said. \"That's why all of our shorts have this super soft built-in boxer brief liner that's also sustainably made.\"&#160;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f84dd8091aa9e001880b27c?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Fair Harbor Kids Collection\" height=\"1650\" width=\"1094\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Fair Harbor</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><h2><strong>Kid's as a step into a full lifestyle brand</strong></h2><p>\"We're very excited about the opportunity in the kids market,\" Jake said. \"We're a profitable business and we did not raise any additional capital and we were able to fund [the kid's line] with our cash flow. We're keeping a lean and mean team.\"&#160;</p><p>The new Fair Harbor kids collection soft-launched this October. Caroline said they had been teasing the idea for a few months and it has gained \"incredible traction.\"&#160;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f84e6a1c255d800190b97a2?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Fair Harbor Kids Collection\" height=\"1098\" width=\"1465\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Another still from the latest Kid&#39;s collection at Fair Harbor.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Fair Harbor</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/fair-harbor-sustainable-swimsuit-line-recycled-plastic-bottles-2020-06\">As Business Insider previously reported</a>, Fair Harbor was born in 2014. Jake was studying geography at Colgate University at the time, learning about global ocean currents and climatology. His studies got him to think more about the waste that was accumulating in the ocean.&#160;</p><p>So, he teamed up with Caroline, his sister, who had an interest in fashion, and together they created Fair Harbor, a sustainable fashion brand that turned recycled water bottles into clothing.&#160;</p><p>The duo brought forth this business idea to a mock \"Shark Tank\" competition at Colgate University, and subsequently won a $20,000 grant that helped fund the company. After another round of fundraising from family and friends, Fair Harbor was born and has since become one of the fastest-growing sustainable brands in the country.&#160;</p><p>Jake said they are now working on their spring and fall collections, the latter of which is his \"passion project.\"&#160;</p><p>\"I won't release exactly what we're working on, but I'm incredibly excited about these products,\" he said. \"What we're really working on is having products that will be able to be sold and worn all year round.\"&#160;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5ec4055faee6a8597e724664?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Fair Harbor\" height=\"5410\" width=\"7214\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>A Fair Harbor product imagery.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Fair Harbor</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Right now, Jake and Caroline are hunkering down at their parents' house in Westchester County, New York. They have plans to return full-time to New York City, and have already started working once more out of their offices in Soho, and managing their store out in Sag Harbor.&#160;</p><p>\"A core value of our company has always been approachable sustainability, to show how people can make small changes to their everyday lives, and to live more sustainably,\" Caroline said.
