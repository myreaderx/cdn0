We find that depending on the emission strength, aerosol profile height and season of the eruption, up to 4 % of the tropical aerosol forcing can be counterbalanced. A power function relationship between cold-point warming/SWV forcing and AOD in the yearly average is found, allowing us to estimate the SWV forcing for comparable eruptions.\n\n                ","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Sat, 01 May 2021 10:09:43 +0000","feedId":26477,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"93f34dd2209cfccef2bae49f0878e074","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","publishedOrCreatedDate":1619957969000}],"record":{"createdTime":"2021-05-02 20:19:29","updatedTime":"2021-05-02 20:19:29","feedId":26477,"fetchDate":"Sun, 02 May 2021 12:19:29 +0000","fetchMs":10235,"handleMs":15793,"totalMs":26030,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":20,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"af6ca12eefe249e94a3f077d15d7c168","hostName":"europe61*","requestId":"9ff356c32a264460a30d9d3d6f4a9d03_26477","contentType":"application/xml","totalBytes":0,"bgimgsTotal":0,"bgimgsGithubTotal":0,"articlesImgsTotal":0,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":0,"successGithubMap":{},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-09-07 02:38:40","updatedTime":"2020-09-07 02:38:40","id":26477,"name":"ACP - recent papers","url":"http://www.atmos-chem-phys.net/xml/rss2_0.xml","subscriber":124,"website":null,"icon":"https://acp.copernicus.org/favicon.ico","icon_jsdelivr":null,"description":"Combined list of the recent articles of the journal Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics and the recent discussion forum Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics Discussions","weekly":null,"link":"https://acp.copernicus.org"},"noPictureArticleList":[],"tmpCommonImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBodyImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBgImgCdnBytes":0,"extra4":{"start":1619957942971,"total":0,"statList":[{"spend":10236,"msg":"获取xml内容"},{"spend":15793,"msg":"解释文章"},{"spend":0,"msg":"上传封面图到cdn"},{"spend":0,"msg":"正文链接上传到cdn"},{"spend":0,"msg":"修正封面图上传失败重新上传"}]},"extra5":0,"extra6":0,"extra7ImgCdnFailResultVector":[],"extra10_invalidATagHrefValue":{},"extra111_proxyServerAndStatMap":{},"extra12ImgCdnSuccessResultVector":[],"successGithubMap":{},"failGithubMap":{}}
