In this version you will find support for the time package, improved Project view, and the ability to enable plugins per project. </p>\n</p>\n<p>Remember, you don’t need to wait for the official EAP announcements, as we regularly release nightly builds based on the latest development code. These nightly builds are only available via the <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox/app/\">Toolbox App</a>.</p>\n<p>You can get this EAP build through the <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox/app/\">Toolbox App</a>, by downloading it from the <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/go/nextversion/\">website</a>, or by using a snap package (for Ubuntu). Or update from right inside GoLand by selecting <em>Automatically check updates for Early Access Program</em> in <em>Preferences / Settings | Appearance &#38; Behavior | System Settings | Updates</em>.</p>\n<p align=\"center\"><a class=\"jb-download-button\" href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/go/nextversion/\"><i class=\"download-icon\"></i>Download GoLand 2020.3 EAP #3</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"support_for_time_package\"><strong>Support for time package</strong> </h2>\n<p>We’ve added support for the <a href=\"https://golang.org/pkg/time/\">time package</a> so you can work with time and duration more easily. Code completion(<em>⌃Space</em> on macOS and <em>Ctrl+Space</em> on Windows/Linux) suggests YYYY, MM, DD placeholders from ISO-8601. Press <em>⌘P</em> on macOS or <em>Ctrl+P</em> on Windows/Linux on a token, and the IDE will show its meaning, and of course, you will find syntax highlighting for layout tokens. Code completion also suggests standard time layouts outside of the string literal. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/go-time-support.gif\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"project_view_updates\"><strong>Project view updates </strong></h2>\n<p>We’ve improved the UX when working with files from the Project view. Now when you open a file from the Project view, the focus is automatically placed on the editor to allow you to start working with your code right away. Press the space bar and the IDE will show you a preview of the file in the Project view.  </p>\n<p>If you want to work with several files open in the editor simultaneously, you can now do so with one simple shortcut. Select the file in the <em>Project</em> view and press <em>Shift+Enter</em> to have the IDE split the Editor window and open the file in the right-hand part of it.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/project-view.gif\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"plugins_enabled_per_project\"><strong>Plugins enabled per project </strong></h2>\n<p>We’ve added the ability to enable plugins for the current project or for all projects by selecting <em>Enable for Current Project</em> or <em>Enable for All Projects</em>. In Settings | Preferences / Plugins, press the gear icon on the plugin you want to enable or disable and select the desired option. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/plugins-update.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>That’s all for today!
