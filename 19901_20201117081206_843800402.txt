Internally, Commodore called these the TED series, named after the core IC of the system<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"https://www.pagetable.com/?p=1324#fn:1\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></sup>. This name can be seen in multiple places in the <a href=\"https://github.com/mist64/cbmsrc\">TED KERNAL and BASIC sources</a> as well as <a href=\"https://www.pagetable.com/?p=541\">internal documentation</a>. Even though Commodore never marketed these computers under the name TED, many products around them, like software cartridges, had product codes prefixed with “T”<sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"https://www.pagetable.com/?p=1324#fn:2\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a></sup>.</p> \n<p>The naming for the new peripheral bus of the TED is not completely consistent:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Comments in the <a href=\"https://github.com/mist64/cbmsrc/tree/master/KERNAL_TED_05\">KERNAL driver code</a> call it the <strong>Kennedy</strong> or <strong>KDY</strong> interface – a reference to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Kennedy\">the politician</a>. Some places call it <strong>TEDISK</strong>.</li> \n <li>The 1551 power-on message is “CBM DOS 2.6 <strong>TDISK</strong>”, which seems a variant of “TEDISK”.</li> \n <li>The <a href=\"http://www.zimmers.net/anonftp/pub/cbm/manuals/drives/1551_Disk_Drive_Users_Guide.pdf\">users manual</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.zimmers.net/anonftp/pub/cbm/schematics/drives/new/1551/251860.gif\">schematics</a> of the 1551 disk drive call it <strong>TCBM</strong>. “CBM” is the common abbreviation of “Commodore Business Machines”, and the “T”, as always, stands for “TED”.</li> \n</ul> \n<h2 id=\"History-and-Development\">History and Development</h2> \n<p>The Commodore PET (1977) was using the industry-standard 8-bit parallel <a href=\"https://www.pagetable.com/?p=1023\">IEEE-488 bus</a> for disk drives and printers. For the VIC-20 (1981), Commodore changed layers 1 and 2 of the protocol stack (electrical and byte transfer) into a cheaper <a href=\"https://www.pagetable.com/?p=1135\">serial bus</a>, which turned out to have severe speed problems<sup id=\"fnref:3\"><a href=\"https://www.pagetable.com/?p=1324#fn:3\" rel=\"footnote\">3</a></sup>.</p> \n<p>For the TED series (1984), Commodore decided to create another variant of the protocol stack, replacing layers 1 and 2 again. The new bus was supposed to combine the speed of the IEEE-488 bus with the low cost of the serial bus.</p> \n<p>While the switch from parallel IEEE-488 to serial allowed the protocol stack to retain all key properties of the original design, TCBM drops some of these features:</p> \n<table> \n <thead> \n  <tr> \n   <th> Feature </th> \n   <th> IEEE-488 </th> \n   <th> Serial </th> \n   <th> TCBM </th> \n  </tr> \n </thead> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td> All participants are <strong>daisy-chained</strong>. </td> \n   <td> Yes </td> \n   <td> Yes </td> \n   <td> <strong>No</strong> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td> <strong>One dedicated controller</strong> (the computer) does bus arbitration of <strong>up to 31 devices</strong>. </td> \n   <td> Yes </td> \n   <td> Yes </td> \n   <td> <strong>No</strong> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td> <strong>One-to-many</strong>: Any participant can send data to any set of participants. </td> \n   <td> Yes </td> \n   <td> Yes </td> \n   <td> <strong>No</strong> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td> A device has <strong>multiple channels</strong> for different functions. </td> \n   <td> Yes </td> \n   <td> Yes </td> \n   <td> Yes </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td> Data transmission is <strong>byte stream</strong> based. </td> \n   <td> Yes </td> \n   <td> Yes </td> \n   <td> Yes </td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table> \n<p>A device still has multiple channels, and all data transmission is still byte stream based, because these are properties of the layers 3 and 4, which are retained in TCBM.</p> \n<p>The key difference is that the TCBM bus is point-to-point: The bus is between one controller (the computer) and one device. For connecting multiple devices to one computer, the computer needs one dedicated bus per device.</p> \n<p>With the introduction of Fast Serial with the C128, Commodore gave up the TCBM bus, which had only shipped with the TED series.</p> \n<h2 id=\"Layer-1:-Electrical\">Layer 1: Electrical</h2> \n<h3 id=\"Connectors-and-Pinout\">Connectors and Pinout</h3> \n<p>There are no standardized connectors.

The <a href=\"https://www.pagetable.com/?p=1135\">Standard Serial</a> port only requires 3 GPIO lines and was natively supported by all TED machines. A parallel bus would have required adding an additional I/O controller.</p> \n<p>To save on costs, the I/O controller did not come with the computer. Instead, it shipped with the disk drive, where the costs of the chip were eclipsed by the total cost of the drive (USD 269).</p> \n<p>The 1551 disk drive, the only TCBM device made, came with a fixed cable that ended in the so-called “Paddle”, a cartridge for the TED expansion port. The expansion port on Commodore computers exposes the complete internal bus, allowing the I/O controller in the paddle to map itself into the computer’s address space.</p> \n<p>Each paddle has a pass-through connector to allow using any other cartridge at the same time – or to connect a another paddle.</p> \n<p>A second 1551 required its own paddle on top of the first one. In this setup, there is one I/O controller in each paddle, which is mapped to one of two locations in the computer’s address space. A switch in the disk drive tells the paddle through the DEV line which location and thus which device number the drive should have<sup id=\"fnref:6\"><a href=\"https://www.pagetable.com/?p=1324#fn:6\" rel=\"footnote\">6</a></sup>.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.pagetable.com/?p=1324/docs/cbmbus/tcbm_paddle.jpg\"><img src=\"https://www.pagetable.com/docs/cbmbus/tcbm_paddle_small.jpg\" height=\"494\" width=\"300\" alt=\"\" /></a><a href=\"https://www.pagetable.com/?p=1324/docs/cbmbus/tcbm_paddle_board.jpg\"><img src=\"https://www.pagetable.com/docs/cbmbus/tcbm_paddle_board_small.jpg\" height=\"408\" width=\"300\" alt=\"\" /></a><a href=\"https://www.pagetable.com/?p=1324/docs/cbmbus/tcbm_paddle_connected.jpg\"><img src=\"https://www.pagetable.com/docs/cbmbus/tcbm_paddle_connected_small.jpg\" height=\"247\" width=\"300\" alt=\"\" /></a></p> \n<h4 id=\"Multiple-Busses\">Multiple Busses</h4> \n<p>The TED computers support the Standard Serial bus and send all traffic to devices 4-30 to this bus. If a paddle with DEV = 0 is detected, it will direct traffic to drive 8 to this TCBM bus. And if there is a paddle with DEV = 1, all traffic to drive 9 will go to that TCBM bus. This allows a TED to have up to three separate Commodore Peripheral busses. All participants of the Standard Serial bus can talk to each other, but the TCBM busses are point-to-point<sup id=\"fnref:7\"><a href=\"https://www.pagetable.com/?p=1324#fn:7\" rel=\"footnote\">7</a></sup>.</p> \n<p>The presence of a TCBM device is detected<sup id=\"fnref:8\"><a href=\"https://www.pagetable.com/?p=1324#fn:8\" rel=\"footnote\">8</a></sup> whenever a communication channel is initiated (<a href=\"https://www.pagetable.com/?p=1031\">layer 3</a> TALK or LISTEN) for devices 8 or 9.</p> \n<h2 id=\"Layer-2:-Byte-Transfer\">Layer 2: Byte Transfer</h2> \n<p>The byte transfer layer of TCBM defines the roles of the controller (which is the computer) and the device.</p> \n<p>The controller and the device each own one handshaking line: DAV and ACK, respectively. The names stand for “Data Valid” and “Acklowledge”, but in practice, they are just general handshaking lines with different meanings across the protocol.</p> \n<p>The device also owns the two STATUS lines to communicacte error codes to the controller. The eight DIO lines are shared and used to send data in either direction. The protocol defines at what point which participant owns it.</p> \n<p>All communication is initiated by the controller by telling the device whether data is sent to it or received from it, or whether a layer 3 command is sent to the device.</p> \n<h3 id=\"Sending-Bytes\">Sending Bytes</h3> \n<p>When the controller sends data to the device, it owns the eight DIO lines during the whole process. The basic idea is that the controller sends a TCBM code of 0x83 to indicate a byte send, then sends the byte, and the device returns a two-bit status code.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://www.pagetable.com/docs/cbmbus/tcbm-send.gif\" height=\"577\" width=\"601\" alt=\"\" /></p> \n<p>Let’s go through it step by step:</p> \n<h4 id=\"0:-Initial-State\">0: Initial State</h4> \n<p><img src=\"https://www.pagetable.com/docs/cbmbus/tcbm-01.png\" height=\"261\" width=\"601\" alt=\"\" /><br /> In the initial state, the controller is holding the DAV line to indicate that it it is not ready for the next transmission.

Layer 2 therefore has a mode for the transmission of command byte streams.</p> \n<p>As shown before, for the transmission of each byte, the controller first sends a TCBM code to the device indicating whether a byte is supposed to be sent (0x83) or received (0x84) by the controller.</p> \n<p>Commands are sent just like data bytes, but with a TCBM code of 0x81 or 0x82.</p> \n<p>Whether the TCBM cde is 0x81 or 0x82 depends on the type of layer 3 command: The commands 0x20/0x3F/0x40/0x5F (LISTEN, UNLISTEN, TALK, UNTALK) are sent with the TCBM code 0x81, and the commands 0x60/0xE0/0xF0 (SECOND, CLOSE, OPEN) are sent with the TCBM code 0x82.</p> \n<p>While the other variants of the Commodore Peripheral Bus protocol family strictly separate the layers, this is one case where details from a higher layer leak into a lower layer.</p> \n<table> \n <thead> \n  <tr> \n   <th> TCBM code </th> \n   <th> Description </th> \n  </tr> \n </thead> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td> 0x81 </td> \n   <td> Controller sends command byte (state change) </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td> 0x82 </td> \n   <td> Controller sends command byte (secondary address) </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td> 0x83 </td> \n   <td> Controller sends data byte </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td> 0x84 </td> \n   <td> Controller receives data byte </td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table> \n<h3 id=\"Status-Codes\">Status Codes</h3> \n<p>With the transmission of every byte in either direction, the device sends a two-bit status code to the controller:</p> \n<table> \n <thead> \n  <tr> \n   <th> Status </th> \n   <th> Description </th> \n  </tr> \n </thead> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td> 00 </td> \n   <td> OK </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td> 01 </td> \n   <td> receive error </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td> 10 </td> \n   <td> send error </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td> 11 </td> \n   <td> EOI </td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table> \n<p>In the general case, the device sends a status of 00, which means that everything is okay.</p> \n<p>A receive error is returned by the device if the controller was trying to receive a byte from the device, but the device did not have any data. This corresponds to the IEEE-488 “sender timeout” and the Standard Serial “empty stream” case. It signals a <a href=\"https://www.pagetable.com/?p=1038\">Commodore DOS (layer 4)</a> “FILE NOT FOUND” condition.</p> \n<p>A send error is returned by the device if the controller was trying to send a byte to the device, but the device decided not to accept it.</p> \n<p>The “EOI” (“End or Identify”) status is returned if the byte currently received by the controller is the last byte of the stream.</p> \n<h3 id=\"Timing\">Timing</h3> \n<p>The timing of TCBM is completely flexible, there are no timeouts. Both the controller and the device can stall any step in the protocol as long as they wish<sup id=\"fnref:9\"><a href=\"https://www.pagetable.com/?p=1324#fn:9\" rel=\"footnote\">9</a></sup>.</p> \n<h3 id=\"Discussion\">Discussion</h3> \n<p>A lot can be criticized about the TCBM bus:</p> \n<h4 id=\"Paddle\">Paddle</h4> \n<p>The paddles are of course awkward and ugly<sup id=\"fnref:10\"><a href=\"https://www.pagetable.com/?p=1324#fn:10\" rel=\"footnote\">10</a></sup>, and in the case of two paddles connected at the same time, even to a comical extent.</p> \n<p>If there was no way around the requirement of not shipping the computer with the necessary I/O chip, there could instead have been a cartridge with the chip –&nbsp;like the <a href=\"https://www.pagetable.com/?p=1312\">IEEE-488 cartridge for the C64</a> –&nbsp;supporting any number of daisy-chained devices with cheap DB-25 connectors.</p> \n<h4 id=\"Protocol-Stack-Issues\">Protocol Stack Issues</h4> \n<p>There are two details that divert from the clean original design of the IEEE-488 stack:</p> \n<p>There is no strict separation of layers 2 and 3. The TCBM codes 0x81 and 0x82 on layer 2 depend on the type of command on layer 3. Layer 2 should not have any knowledge of layer 3: It should be possible to add layer 3 commands or even replace all of layer 3 completely, with all layer 2 variants still compatible. This would be true for IEEE-488 and Standard Serial, but not for TCBM.</p> \n<p>Also, with TCBM the communication features are not symmetric any more: While a device can signal the EOI condition by setting the status wires to “11”, there is no way for the controller to signal EOI to the device. For Commodore DOS disk drives, this is not necessary: EOI from the device indicates that the end of a file has been reached, which is necessary and actionable for the controller, but EOI from the controller is not necessary: If the end of a stream sent for writing has been reached, there is nothing actionable for the drive yet. The controller, who knows about the EOI condition, can then send a layer 3 UNTALK or CLOSE command.</p> \n<h4 id=\"Speed\">Speed</h4> \n<p>There are several issues with the protocol, which lead to a much lower speed than what would be expected from a parallel connection:</p> \n<h5 id=\"Unnecessary-Steps\">Unnecessary Steps</h5> \n<p>When the controller receives a byte, releasing DAV in step 4 (“Controller signals DIO belongs to device”) is not necessary. The device can already detect that the TCBM code has been removed from DIO in step 3 (MSB is 0) and use it as a trigger for step 5. In a modified protocol with step 4 removed, DAV would be inverted from this point on. So in step 12, the controller would pull DAV instead of releasing it, which is the initial state, so the additional handshake in step 14 would be unnecessary.</p> \n<h5 id=\"TCBM-Codes\">TCBM Codes</h5> \n<p>The design of the TCBM code being sent with every byte almost halves the trasmission speed because of its two handshakes.</p> \n<p>The complex protocol to hand the DIO wires to the device and pass it back with its extra handshakes will also make receiving slower than sending. But receiving is the common case: Much more data is ever read from disk than written to it.</p> \n<p>Most data transmissions between a computer and a disk drive are the LOAD and SAVE operations, where a full file is transfered in one go. Optimized stream transfer protocols could have been added for these cases – the Fast Serial protocol of the C128 (“Burst”) as well as JiffyDOS do this – doubling the SAVE speed and tripling the LOAD speed.</p> \n<p>A more generic protocol optimization could replace the TCBM code before every byte with an extra wire owned by the controller indicating whether the next byte will be transmitted in the same mode. The common case of transfering multiple bytes would also be sped up by at least a factor of two this way, and even more in the receive case, which would no longer require the DIO handover between bytes.</p> \n<p>This would not even require adding an extra line: It is enough to have one status line going from the device to the computer. “0” would mean OK, and in the rare case of “1”, the controller would transfer DIO to the device, so it can return an 8 bit status code.</p> \n<h5 id=\"Other-Solutions\">Other Solutions</h5> \n<p>It is puzzling why they created a completely custom layer 2 protocol that ended up having so many issues, because they could have started with one of the existing layer 2 protocols and easily adapted it:</p> \n<p>They could have used the exact IEEE-488 protocol on layer 2, even in point-to-point mode with just a single device. IEEE-488 only requires one more data line (13 instead of 12), but if that had been an issue, they could have removed EOI and used a timing sidechannel instead, as done by Standard Serial.</p> \n<p>Another option would have been to just reuse the Standard Serial protocol and add another 8 parallel wires for the transfer of the actual data, for a total of 11 wires (one fewer than TCBM). That’s what third party hardware extensions for the C64/1541 like Speed DOS and Professional DOS did.</p> \n<p>Yet another option would have been to finally implement the original hardware-based serial protocol that was intended for the VIC-20, but scrapped because of hardware bugs. 8 data lines and one handshaking line can be replaced by one data line and a handshaking line, with a dedicated hardware shift register pushing a bit every few cycles. With hardware that has a working shift register, there is nothing wrong with such a protocol.</p> \n<p>A shift register based serial protocol is exactly what replaced TCBM in the C128 as the “Fast Serial” protocol.</p> \n<h4 id=\"Conclusion\">Conclusion</h4> \n<p>While TCBM is faster than Standard Serial, it is a huge compromise and certainly not a clean design. And with more than half the bandwidth eaten up by the TCBM codes, it is still slower than IEEE-488.</p> \n<h3 id=\"Next-Up\">Next Up</h3> \n<p>Part 6 of the series of articles on the Commodore Peripheral Bus family will cover the JiffyDOS protocol on layer 2, which shipped as a third party ROM patch for computers and drives, replacing the byte transmission protocol of Standard Serial by using the clock and data lines in a more efficient way.</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>This article series is an Open Source project.
