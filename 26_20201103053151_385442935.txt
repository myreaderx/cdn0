It&#8217;s hosting virtual kitchens from celebrity chefs like David Chang&#8217;s <a href=\"https://eatfuku.com/\">Fuku</a>, and, according to the company, offering lifelines to beloved local restaurateurs like the chain <a href=\"http://jackswifefreda.com/\">Jack&#8217;s Wife Freda</a> in New York or <a href=\"http://www.chefmichellebernstein.com/\">Michelle Bernstein&#8217;s kitchens</a> in Miami.</p>\n<p>These restaurants are, in some cases, taking advantage of the employees that REEF Technology has operating its network of kitchens. It&#8217;s another difference between WeWork and REEF. The company not only provides the space, in many instances it&#8217;s providing the labor that&#8217;s allowing businesses to scale.</p>\n<p>The company already employs over a thousand kitchen workers prepping food at its restaurants. And REEF acquired a company earlier in May to consolidate its back-end service for on-demand deliveries.</p>\n<p>That same strategy will likely apply to other aspects of the company&#8217;s services, as well.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;We’re building a platform of proximity,&#8221; says Ojalvo. &#8220;That proximity is driven through an install base that’s in parking lots or parking garages… [and] that enables all sorts of companies to use its proximity as a platform.

According to a spokesman, only several hundred of the company&#8217;s planned 10,000 businesses will have the kind of multi-use mall environment that encourages neighborhood access. Instead, its business seems to be based on the notion that most delivery services should be no more than 15 minutes away.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a different project, but it also has a number of supporters. One could argue that cloud kitchen providers like Zuul, Kitchen United, and Travis Kalanick&#8217;s Cloud Kitchens all ascribe to the same belief. Kalanick, the Uber co-founder and former CEO whose company received billions from SoftBank, has been snapping up properties in the US and Asia under an investment vehicle called City Storage Systems, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/uber-founder-travis-kalanicks-new-company-turns-parking-lots-and-abandoned-shopping-malls-into-space-for-businesses-2018-3\">which also uses parking lots and abandoned malls as fulfillment centers</a>.</p>\n<p>Big retailers also have taken notice of the new revenue stream and one of America&#8217;s largest, Kroger, is even running a ghost kitchen experiment in the Midwest.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"W2dflHeUpQ\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/kroger-one-of-americas-largest-grocery-chains-experiments-with-ghost-kitchens-and-delivery-in-the-midwest/\">Kroger, one of America&#8217;s largest grocery chains, experiments with ghost kitchens and delivery in the Midwest</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Kroger, one of America&#8217;s largest grocery chains, experiments with ghost kitchens and delivery in the Midwest&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/kroger-one-of-americas-largest-grocery-chains-experiments-with-ghost-kitchens-and-delivery-in-the-midwest/embed/#?secret=W2dflHeUpQ\" data-secret=\"W2dflHeUpQ\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>If that&#8217;s not enough, there are plenty of under-utilized assets that are already on the market thanks to the economic downturn wrought by the COVID-19 pandemic and the government&#8217;s efforts to contain it.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I guess a lot depends on how you think delivery players work out in the coming years versus say drive through or curbside pickup which seems to be where large national players are focused (Starbucks, McDonalds, Dominos, etc),&#8221; wrote on venture investor in an email. &#8220;But how do delivery players use these spaces versus say lots of low cost retail spaces that can be used to staging or package returns.

Roughly half of the average modern American city, as REEF notes, is devoted to parking, while parks occupy only 10% of urban spaces. REEF&#8217;s language is centered on changing a world of parking lots into a space of paradises, but that language belies a reality that makes its money (at least for now) off of isolating individuals into personal spaces where their commercial needs are met by delivery &#8212; not by community interaction.</p>\n<p>Still, the fact remains that something needs to change.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Traditional developers and local policies have been slow to adopt new technologies and operating models,&#8221; said Stonly Baptiste, an investor in the transformation of urban environments through the fund, Urban.Us (which is not a backer of REEF). &#8220;But the demand is growing for a better &#8216;city product&#8217;, the need to make cities better for the environment and our lives has never been greater, and the dream to build the city of the future never dies. Not that dream is subsidized by VC.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=CS_C-HuY3aU:iM4E6lJg0z0:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=CS_C-HuY3aU:iM4E6lJg0z0:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=CS_C-HuY3aU:iM4E6lJg0z0:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=CS_C-HuY3aU:iM4E6lJg0z0:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=CS_C-HuY3aU:iM4E6lJg0z0:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=CS_C-HuY3aU:iM4E6lJg0z0:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=CS_C-HuY3aU:iM4E6lJg0z0:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=CS_C-HuY3aU:iM4E6lJg0z0:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/CS_C-HuY3aU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 03 Nov 2020 05:01:33 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/vehicles-GettyImages-1215795874.jpg","linkMd5":"749a32bc64dd7ed35d1f2b2fd5939a03","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn15@2020_6/2020/11/03/05-31-33-198_0363be0af30b4e19.webp","destWidth":5464,"destHeight":3640,"sourceBytes":12338697,"destBytes":444024,"author":"Jonathan Shieber","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/vehicles-GettyImages-1215795874.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn15@2020_6/2020/11/03/05-31-33-198_0363be0af30b4e19.webp","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/deliveroo2.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn7@2020_1/2020/11/03/05-31-36-340_2222e9cb5ffe14bd.webp","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-02-at-10.05.26-PM.png?w=680":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn95@2020_4/2020/11/03/05-31-35-102_5a7328d3cd5a4b84.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn22@2020_6/2020/11/03/05-31-20-196_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn96@2020_5/2020/11/03/05-31-35-908_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn52@2020_4/2020/11/03/05-31-34-882_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=CS_C-HuY3aU:iM4E6lJg0z0:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn45@2020_4/2020/11/03/05-31-35-934_ab387c62b9746c7b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=CS_C-HuY3aU:iM4E6lJg0z0:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn2@2020_3/2020/11/03/05-31-34-764_ffabfe57e9e9c964.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn35@2020_5/2020/11/03/05-31-35-960_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/CS_C-HuY3aU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn39@2020_1/2020/11/03/05-31-36-045_73fcfc38eff67742.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1604381479576},{"createdTime":"2020-11-03 13:31:19","updatedTime":"2020-11-03 13:31:19","title":"AWS launches its next-gen GPU instances","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2069013","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">AWS today <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-gpu-equipped-ec2-p4-instances-for-machine-learning-hpc/\">announced</a> the launch of its newest GPU-equipped instances.

These instances, AWS promises, offer up to 2.5x the deep learning performance of the previous generation &#8212; and training a comparable model should be about 60% cheaper with these new instances.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2069025\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Graphic@2x-nividia-30.png\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2069025\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2069025\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Graphic@2x-nividia-30.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"731\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Graphic@2x-nividia-30.png 1340w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Graphic@2x-nividia-30.png?resize=150,107 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Graphic@2x-nividia-30.png?resize=300,214 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Graphic@2x-nividia-30.png?resize=768,548 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Graphic@2x-nividia-30.png?resize=680,485 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Graphic@2x-nividia-30.png?resize=50,36 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2069025\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> AWS</p></div></p>\n<p>For now, there is only one size available, <a href=\"https://pages.awscloud.com/amazon-ec2-p4d.html\">the p4d.12xlarge instance</a>, in AWS slang, and the eight A100 GPUs are connected over Nvidia&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/nvlink/\">NVLink communication interface</a> and offer support for the company&#8217;s <a href=\"https://developer.nvidia.com/gpudirect\">GPUDirect interface</a> as well.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>With 320 GB of high-bandwidth GPU memory and 400 Gbps networking, this is obviously a very powerful machine.

Difficult as it might be to imagine, there must be other things to work on. One thing that comes to mind is the impact of the virus on how we manage our days and nights in a digital environment. Mobile devices have already propelled much of the change, but the pandemic has accelerated the move to a hybrid distributed lifestyle.</p>\n<p>The election has mandated our attention to the political situation in ways that have expanded early voting and legal efforts to slow it down. Regardless of the outcome, the pressure to adapt to this new collaborative workflow will intensify. People have already seen significant shifts from commuting to time switching in a home context. Podcasting, which had emerged from a hackerish geeky hobby in recent years, has morphed into a more commercial adjunct to mainstream media.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>In the process, new formats such as newsletters and live streaming have attracted investment from companies including Spotify and Audible, related technologies like Otter (transcription), Substack, Medium, new bundles of services (Apple One) and cable network disrupters, Digital first publishers like The Recount may have started out as traditional takes on political commentary, but in the windup of the campaign they are reaching audiences via notifications rather than repetitive cable talking heads and panels.</p>\n<p>This roll up of breaking notifications and user-controlled editorial access have major implications for the near future post-electuon, however long it takes to plow through legal challenges and the restaffing of whichever government is formed. Also impacted will be Congressional and antitrust attempts to regulate social media, and what I suspect will be a shift to private discussions and trend analysis. The interest groups and market makers that result from this realignment will offer exit strategies for companies like Twitter and YouTube where the risk of being broken up will be mitigated by powerful new business models for content creation and distribution.</p>\n<p>By January 20th, a new influencer architecture based on notifications and live streaming will endow the media with tools it needs to lead the transition to safe, secure, hybrid digital/live events. Streaming will give new artists and entrepreneurs a platform to separate influence and impact from lossleader gatherings online, bolstered by association with food and tools delivery winners like Apple and Amazon. A similar synergy between tech companies and media advertising will be overt (Apple + and Prime) as well as implicit (the growth in Amazon search.and Twitch watch parties.)</p>\n<p>COVID therapeutics such as Regeneron create a roadmap for these private groups to reorganize as CostCo-like next wave restaurants, entertainment events, and political efforts to consolidate economic power. With a combination of transparency and what could be called reverse boycotts, customers will align with products and companies who promote values-based association with stakeholders acrosss the spectrum.</p>\n<p>Central to the relationship is providing ethical access to important data in return for clear guidelines for the use of that data at scale. If this election has been correctly assessed as signaling a massive change in the electorate, the period of deescalation from the pandemic can foster a sense of ownership of that success by the incoming majority. Notification-based entertainers such as Sarah Cooper and more mainstream projects like Matthew McConaughey’s new book, Greenlights, speak initially to the Zoom home/work crowd, and soon to the formation of new studios and networks.</p>\n<p>Who really knows how this transformation is playing out given the terrible consequences of Trump’s impact on our country and its standing in the world. But the generation that followed the Greatest Generation is discovering it has more to it than the free love of rock and roll and following our bliss. That same generation ushered in the technology and media revolutions.</p>\n<p>Now we’re suffering the backlash of so-called free software where our data is the real product, where Big Brother is extending power by acquihires and preemptive pivots.

The X project sought to identify a specific biomarker for depression &#8212; it did not accomplish that (and the researchers now believe that a single biomarker for depression and anxiety likely didn&#8217;t exist), but X is still hoping that its work on using electroencephalography (EEG) combined with machine learning to try to find one will be of benefit to others.</p>\n<p>X&#8217;s researchers were hoping that depression, like other ailments and disorders, might have a clear biomarker that would help healthcare professionals more easily and objectively diagnose depression, which would also then hopefully make it more easily and consistently treatable. With EEG, there was some precedent, via studies done in labs using games designed specifically for the purpose, in which people with depression seemed to consistently demonstrate a lower measure of EEG activity in response to effectively &#8220;winning&#8221; the games.</p>\n<p>These studies seemed to offer a path to a potential biomarker, but in order to make them actually useful in real-world diagnostic settings, like a clinic or a public health lab, the team at X set about improving the process of EEG collection and interpretation to make it more accessible, both to users and to technicians.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>What is perhaps most notable about this pursuit, and the post today that Alphabet released detailing its efforts, is that it&#8217;s essentially a story of a years-long investigation that didn&#8217;t work out &#8212; not the side of the moonshot story you typically hear from big tech companies.</p>\n<p>In fact, this is perhaps one of the best examples yet of what critics of many of the approaches of large tech companies fail to understand &#8212; that some problems are not solvable by solutions with analogs in the world of software and engineering.</p>\n<p>The team at X sums up its learnings from the years-long research project in three main bullet points about its user research, and each of them touch in some way on the insufficiency of a pure objective biomarker detection method (even if it had worked), particularly when it comes to mental illness. From the researchers:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Mental health measurement remains an unsolved problem</strong>. Despite the availability of many mental health surveys and scales, they are not widely used, especially in primary care and counseling settings. Reasons range from burden (“I don’t have time for this”) to skepticism (“Using a scale is no better than using my clinical judgement”) to lack of trust (“I don’t think my client is filling this in truthfully” and ”I don’t want to reveal this much to my counsellor”). These findings were in line with the literature on measurement-based mental health care. Any new measurement tool would have to overcome these barriers by creating clear value for both the person with lived experience and the clinician.</li>\n<li><strong>There is value in combining subjective and objective data</strong>. People with lived experience and clinicians both welcomed the introduction of objective metrics, but not as a replacement for subjective assessment and asking people about their experience and feelings. The combination of subjective and objective metrics was seen as especially powerful. Objective metrics might validate the subjective experience; or if the two diverge, that in itself is an interesting insight which provides the starting point for a conversation.</li>\n<li><strong>There are multiple use cases for new measurement technology.</strong> Our initial hypothesis was that clinicians might use a “brainwave test” as a diagnostic aid. However, this concept got a lukewarm reception. Mental health experts such as psychiatrists and clinical psychologists felt confident in their ability to diagnose via clinical interview. Primary care physicians thought an EEG test could be useful, but only if it was conducted by a medical assistant before their consultation with the patient, similar to a blood pressure test. Counsellors and social workers don’t do diagnosis in their practice, so it was irrelevant to them. Some people with lived experience did not like the idea of being labelled as depressed by a machine. By contrast, there was a notably strong interest in using technology as a tool for ongoing monitoring — capturing changes in mental health state over time — to learn what happens between visits. Many clinicians asked if they could send the EEG system home so their patients and clients could repeat the test on their own. They were also very interested in EEG’s potential predictive qualities, e.g. predicting who is likely to get more depressed in future. More research is needed to determine how a tool such as EEG would be best deployed in clinical and counseling settings, including how it could be combined with other measurement technologies such as digital phenotyping.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>X is making Amber&#8217;s hardware and software open-source on <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/github\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"github\">GitHub, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> and is also issuing a &#8220;patent pledge&#8221; that ensures X will not bring any legal action against users of the EEG patents related to Amber through use of the open-sourced material.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s unclear (though unlikely) that this would have been the result had Amber succeeded at finding a single biomarker for depression, but perhaps in the hands of the broader community, the work the team did on rendering EEG more accessible beyond specialized testing facilities will lead to other interesting discoveries.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=SuMNaUgMEeQ:R1KImLNiMPY:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=SuMNaUgMEeQ:R1KImLNiMPY:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=SuMNaUgMEeQ:R1KImLNiMPY:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=SuMNaUgMEeQ:R1KImLNiMPY:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=SuMNaUgMEeQ:R1KImLNiMPY:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=SuMNaUgMEeQ:R1KImLNiMPY:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=SuMNaUgMEeQ:R1KImLNiMPY:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=SuMNaUgMEeQ:R1KImLNiMPY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/SuMNaUgMEeQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 02 Nov 2020 20:23:08 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"ce8411f09376f499e05c64e6e50815ea","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn22@2020_6/2020/11/03/05-31-20-196_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Darrell Etherington","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn22@2020_6/2020/11/03/05-31-20-196_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn96@2020_5/2020/11/03/05-31-35-908_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn52@2020_4/2020/11/03/05-31-34-882_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=SuMNaUgMEeQ:R1KImLNiMPY:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn49@2020_1/2020/11/03/05-31-35-922_2ff6f72c94950e16.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=SuMNaUgMEeQ:R1KImLNiMPY:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn68@2020_4/2020/11/03/05-31-34-808_f92ade59b71898ab.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn35@2020_5/2020/11/03/05-31-35-960_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/SuMNaUgMEeQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn50@2020_5/2020/11/03/05-31-35-993_11c0c0d548d84855.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1604381479576},{"createdTime":"2020-11-03 13:31:19","updatedTime":"2020-11-03 13:31:19","title":"Spotify will now allow artists and labels to promote tracks in your recommendations","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2068739","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/spotify\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"spotify\">Spotify <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> <a href=\"https://newsroom.spotify.com/2020-11-02/amplifying-artist-input-in-your-personalized-recommendations/\">announced</a> today it will begin to test a new service that gives artists more of a say in how their music is discovered on the Spotify platform. At launch, the service will allow artists and labels to identify music that&#8217;s a priority to them, and Spotify will then add a signal to help the music get surfaced by its personalization algorithms.</p>\n<p>While the new service is not a paid promotion and requires no upfront budget on artists&#8217; or labels&#8217; part, Spotify says that the artists, labels and rights holders will agree to be paid a &#8220;promotional recording royalty rate&#8221; for streams where the company provides the service. Streams that come from any other place in the app would not be impacted, however.</p>\n<p>At launch, the promotional rate will apply only in select areas of Spotify&#8217;s app, including Spotify Radio and Autoplay.

That&#8217;s why the company won&#8217;t require an upfront payment from artists and labels, he says.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We were looking for a model that was acceptable, more democratic and fair&#8230;The model is going to allow even really small artists to access promotions at the same terms of the biggest labels,&#8221; Lamb adds.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2068831\" style=\"width: 638px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2068831\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2068831\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Spotify_Personalized-Recommendations.png?w=628\" alt=\"\" width=\"628\" height=\"680\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Spotify_Personalized-Recommendations.png 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Spotify_Personalized-Recommendations.png?resize=138,150 138w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Spotify_Personalized-Recommendations.png?resize=277,300 277w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Spotify_Personalized-Recommendations.png?resize=768,832 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Spotify_Personalized-Recommendations.png?resize=628,680 628w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Spotify_Personalized-Recommendations.png?resize=46,50 46w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 628px) 100vw, 628px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2068831\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits: </strong>Spotify</p></div></p>\n<p>The idea is that if a track does well due to the promotion, the rights holders would see an overall positive ROI as the music becomes more popular and sees increased plays outside of the areas where the lower, promotional rate applies. Artists can also turn off the promotions at any time if the tool is not having a positive financial benefit.</p>\n<p>Spotify isn&#8217;t detailing the extent of the royalty rate change for promotions, saying that it may be adjusted as a result of the test.</p>\n<p>The company also stresses it will take listener interest and enjoyment into consideration with this change. Spotify says if the music performs well, it will continue to promote it. But if it doesn&#8217;t, it will be pulled back.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We won’t guarantee placement to labels or artists, and we only ever recommend music we think listeners will want to hear,&#8221; Spotify notes, in <a href=\"https://newsroom.spotify.com/2020-11-02/amplifying-artist-input-in-your-personalized-recommendations/\">its public announcement.</a></p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"ljaO6hsgkK\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/29/spotify-ceo-says-company-will-further-expand-price-increases/\">Spotify CEO says company will &#8216;further expand price increases&#8217;</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Spotify CEO says company will &#8216;further expand price increases&#8217;&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/29/spotify-ceo-says-company-will-further-expand-price-increases/embed/#?secret=ljaO6hsgkK\" data-secret=\"ljaO6hsgkK\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>Lamb clarifies this means users may hear a promoted track if they already listen to that genre or artist, but also if there are other signals that indicate a user may be receptive to the music. For example, users could come across the promoted track if the music was acoustically similar to what they already listen to. It could also be placed in front of the user if they listen to similar artists, or if people who have similar listening habits also listen to that music.</p>\n<p>The reverse will also be true. If those who share a user&#8217;s listening habits are negatively responding to a promoted track &#8212; perhaps by skipping it in a session or choosing to stream less frequently from Radio, for instance &#8212; the music could be pulled back.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If any kind of recommendation was causing a listener to respond negatively or show less interest in radio systems, then we would adjust how we&#8217;re recommending,&#8221; Lamb says.</p>\n<p>This user feedback loop can quickly impact the extent with which the track is promoted, he also notes, as the recommendation pools for listeners are updated every 24 hours.</p>\n<p>There is currently no limit to how many tracks that an artist or label can promote at once, nor any limit on the time frame of the promotion.</p>\n<p>While artists can promote tracks of any recency, Spotify believes the largest focus for this tool would be on catalog music. For example, if the artist is looking to celebrate an album anniversary or take advantage of a &#8220;cultural moment.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In other words, if an artist sees sudden viral success for an older track, this service could help.

When authoritative results are in, Facebook will change those messages to reflect the official results. Importantly, U.S. election results might not be clear on election night or for some days afterward, a potential outcome for which Facebook and other social networks are bracing.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2068942\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2068942\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2068942\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/facebook-election-message.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"Facebook election message\" width=\"680\" height=\"623\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/facebook-election-message.jpeg 890w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/facebook-election-message.jpeg?resize=150,138 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/facebook-election-message.jpeg?resize=300,275 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/facebook-election-message.jpeg?resize=768,704 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/facebook-election-message.jpeg?resize=680,623 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/facebook-election-message.jpeg?resize=50,46 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2068942\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image via Facebook</p></div></p>\n<p>If a candidate declared victory prematurely, Facebook doesn&#8217;t say it will remove those claims, but it will pair them with its message that there&#8217;s no official result and voting is still underway.</p>\n<p><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/twitter\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"twitter\">Twitter <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/10/twitter-contested-election-misinformation-policy-trump/\">released its plans</a> for handling election results two months ago, explaining that it will either remove or attach a warning label to premature claims of victory before authoritative election results are in. The company also explicitly stated that it will act against any tweets &#8220;inciting unlawful conduct to prevent a peaceful transfer of power or orderly succession,&#8221; a shocking rule to have to articulate, but a necessary one in 2020.</p>\n<p>On Monday, Twitter <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/02/twitter-explains-how-it-will-handle-misleading-tweets-about-the-us-election-results/\">elaborated on its policy</a>, saying that it would focus on labeling misleading tweets about the presidential election and other contested races.

Users can still retweet by clicking through a pop-up page, but Twitter made the change to encourage people to quote retweet instead.

After Russian disinformation <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/10/russian-facebook-ads-house-intelligence-full-list/\">took root on social platforms four years ago</a>, those companies now coordinate with one another and the government about the threats they’re seeing.</p>\n<p>In the aftermath of 2016, Facebook eventually woke up to the idea that its platform could be leveraged to scale social ills like hate and misinformation. Its scorecard is uneven, but its actions against foreign disinformation have been <a href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/tag/coordinated-inauthentic-behavior/\">robust</a>, reducing that threat considerably.</p>\n<p>A repeat of the same concerns from 2016 is unlikely. Facebook made aggressive efforts to find foreign coordinated disinformation campaigns across its platforms, and it publishes what it finds regularly and with little delay. But in 2020, the biggest concerns are coming from within the country — not without.</p>\n<p>Most foreign information operations have been small so far, failing to gain much traction. Last month, Facebook removed <a href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2020/10/removing-coordinated-inauthentic-behavior-mexico-iran-myanmar/\">a network of fake accounts</a> connected to Iran. The operation was small and failed to generate much traction, but it shows that U.S. adversaries are still interested in trying out the tactic.</p>\n<h2>Misleading political ads</h2>\n<p>To address concerns around election misinformation in ads, Facebook opted for a temporary political ad blackout, starting at 12 a.m. PT on November 4 and continuing until the company deems it safe to toggle them back on. Facebook hasn&#8217;t accepted any new political ads <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/03/facebook-to-block-new-political-ads-1-week-before-nov-3-adds-more-tools-and-rules-for-fair-elections/\">since October 27</a> and previously said it won&#8217;t accept any ads that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/01/facebook-election-ad-ban-delegitimize-election-results/\">delegitimize the results</a> of the election. Google will also pause election-related ads after polls close Tuesday.</p>\n<p>Facebook has made a number of big changes to political ads since 2016, when <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/10/russian-facebook-ads-house-intelligence-full-list/\">Russia bought Facebook ads</a> to meddle with U.S. politics. Political ads on the platform are subject to more scrutiny and much more transparency now and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/\">Facebook&#8217;s ad library</a> emerged as an exemplary tool that allows anyone to see what ads have been published, who bought them and how much they spent.</p>\n<p>Unlike Facebook, Twitter&#8217;s way of dealing with political advertising was <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/jack-dorsey-twitter-will-no-longer-accept-political-and-issue-ads\">cutting it off entirely</a>. The company announced the change a year ago and hasn&#8217;t looked back since. TikTok also opted to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/03/tiktok-explains-its-ban-on-political-advertising/\">disallow political ads</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">We’ve made the decision to stop all political advertising on Twitter globally.

We&#8217;ll be watching how Facebook handles emerging threats of violence this week.</p>\n<p>Its recent decisive moves against extremism are important, but the platform has long incubated groups that use the company&#8217;s networking and event tools to come together for potential real-world violence. Even if they aren&#8217;t allowed on the platform any longer, many of those groups got organized and then moved their networks onto alternative social networks and private channels. Still, making it more difficult to organize violence on mainstream social networks is a big step in the right direction.</p>\n<p>Twitter also addressed the potential threat of election-related violence in advance, noting that it may add warnings or require users to remove any tweets &#8220;inciting interference with the election&#8221; or encouraging violence.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"cWL86Xvi79\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/facebook-qanon-ban/\">Facebook says it will ban QAnon across its platforms</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Facebook says it will ban QAnon across its platforms&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/facebook-qanon-ban/embed/#?secret=cWL86Xvi79\" data-secret=\"cWL86Xvi79\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<h2>Platform policy shifts in 2020</h2>\n<p>Facebook is the biggest online arena where U.S. political life plays out. While a similar number of Americans watch videos on YouTube, Facebook is where they go to duke it out over candidates, share news stories (some legitimate, some not) and generally express themselves politically. It&#8217;s a tinderbox in normal times — and 2020 is far from normal.</p>\n<p>While Facebook acted against foreign threats quickly after 2016, the company dragged its feet on platform changes that could be perceived as politically motivated — a hesitation that backfired by incubating dangerous extremists and allowing many kinds of misinformation, particularly on the far-right, to survive and thrive.</p>\n<p>In spite of Facebook&#8217;s lingering <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/11/01/facebook-election-misinformation/\">misguided political fears</a>, there are reasons to be hopeful that the company might avert election-related catastrophes.</p>\n<p>Whether it was inspired by the threat of a contested election, federal antitrust action or a possible Biden presidency, Facebook has signaled a shift to more thoughtful moderation with a flurry of recent policy enforcement decisions. An accompanying flurry of election-focused podcast and television ads suggests Facebook is worried about public perception too — and it should be.</p>\n<p>Twitter&#8217;s plan for the election has been well-communicated and detailed. In 2020, the company treats its policy decisions with more transparency, communicates them in real time and isn&#8217;t afraid to admit to mistakes. The relatively small social network plays an outsized role in publishing political content that&#8217;s amplified elsewhere, so the choices it makes are critical for countering misinformation and extremism.</p>\n<p>The companies that host and amplify online political conversation have learned some major lessons since 2016 — mostly the hard way. Let&#8217;s just hope it was enough to help them guide their roiling platforms through one of the most fraught moments in modern U.S. history.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/tag/2020-election/\"><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/us-2020-election-footer.png\" /></a></p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=zCCrKSl_24E:YZUjXBfMpSg:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=zCCrKSl_24E:YZUjXBfMpSg:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=zCCrKSl_24E:YZUjXBfMpSg:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=zCCrKSl_24E:YZUjXBfMpSg:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=zCCrKSl_24E:YZUjXBfMpSg:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=zCCrKSl_24E:YZUjXBfMpSg:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=zCCrKSl_24E:YZUjXBfMpSg:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=zCCrKSl_24E:YZUjXBfMpSg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/zCCrKSl_24E\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 02 Nov 2020 20:57:35 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/facebook-election-message.jpeg?w=680","linkMd5":"ca294f9db74c56865f8cd156647939b4","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn11@2020_1/2020/11/03/05-31-20-089_462095a5b3e36813.webp","destWidth":680,"destHeight":623,"sourceBytes":153568,"destBytes":153568,"author":"Taylor Hatmaker","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/facebook-election-message.jpeg?w=680":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn11@2020_1/2020/11/03/05-31-20-089_462095a5b3e36813.webp","https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/1f9f5.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn40@2020_3/2020/11/03/05-31-34-870_932e850fea192ac5.webp","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/us-2020-election-footer.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn45@2020_3/2020/11/03/05-31-36-228_f68d83017a52e30b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn22@2020_6/2020/11/03/05-31-20-196_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn96@2020_5/2020/11/03/05-31-35-908_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn52@2020_4/2020/11/03/05-31-34-882_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=zCCrKSl_24E:YZUjXBfMpSg:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn8@2020_5/2020/11/03/05-31-34-974_9ca6b00e50bfeb15.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=zCCrKSl_24E:YZUjXBfMpSg:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn53@2020_3/2020/11/03/05-31-46-079_6726ecf50177a8c9.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn35@2020_5/2020/11/03/05-31-35-960_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/zCCrKSl_24E":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn4@2020_2/2020/11/03/05-31-34-725_8d0dbd9c2cfbfacf.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1604381479576},{"createdTime":"2020-11-03 13:31:19","updatedTime":"2020-11-03 13:31:19","title":"Booming edtech M&A activity brings consolidation to a fragmented sector","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2068705","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to force teachers, students and parents to adopt new technologies, edtech’s total addressable market has massively grown in the last several months.

Finally, K-12 curriculum company Discovery Education bought K-5 science and stem curriculum upstart Mystery Science.</p>\n<p>It’s a lot of news in a short period of time. Luckily, these consolidations offer some directional guidance regarding where some edtech businesses think the future of their industry is headed.</p>\n<h2>Smart content as a competitive advantage</h2>\n<p>Content, to an extent, is commoditized. If you can find a free tutorial on Youtube or <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/khan-academy\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"khan-academy\">Khan Academy, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> buy a subscription to an edtech platform that offers the same solution? The commodification of education is good for end-users and is often why startups have a freemium model as a customer acquisition strategy.

Course Hero’s acquisition of Symbolab was essentially a deal for more than a decade&#8217;s worth of data that captured which math questions students found hardest.</p>\n<p>Symbolab is a math calculator that is set to answer over 1 billion questions this year. With each answer, Symbolab adds information to its algorithm regarding students&#8217; most common pain points and confusion. Course Hero, in contrast, is a broader service that focuses on Q&#38;A from a variety of subjects. CEO <a href=\"https://twitter.com/atgrauer?lang=en\">Andrew Grauer</a> says Symbolab’s algorithm isn’t something that Course Hero, which has been operating since 2006, can drum up overnight. That’s precisely why he “decided to buy, instead of build.”</p>\n<p>“It made a lot of sense to move fast enough so it wouldn&#8217;t take up multiple years to get this technology,” Grauer said. The deal was made as big companies get in the Q&#38;A game too, he noted. <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/google\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"google\">Google <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> acquired homework helper app Socratic in 2019 and <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/microsoft\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"microsoft\">Microsoft <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> built Microsoft Solver in the same year.</p>\n<p>Discovery Education, a curriculum provider for K-12 classrooms, acquired San Francisco-based K-5 STEM curriculum provider, Mystery Science. Discovery Education has launched a series of other products focused on science education, including Discovery Education Experience, the Science Techbook series and STEM Connect.  However, Mystery Science is largely focused on offering a creative digital solution to science education. The programming, a mix of videos, prompts and projects, cover a range of questions such as, “Where do rivers flow?” and “Could a volcano pop up where you live?” for young students.</p>\n<p>Mystery Science CEO and founder Keith Schact explained how his product focuses on kids and educators, while Discovery Education focuses on educators and districts, making the deal feel like a &#8220;natural marriage.&#8221; Even as edtech goes directly to consumers, Schact remains bullish on the role that institutions play in true adoption of technology.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You can go straight to teachers and get a certain market share,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But the institutions still do have a big role.&#8221; The founder likened the dynamic to the state of media: With the rise of blogs, you can publish directly and reach an engaged audience, but writers who want a bigger positioning tend to join larger platforms to grow their overall reach. Edtech is the same, in that some startups need an official sign-off from schools before they can reach venture-scale returns.</p>\n<p>According to a source familiar with the transaction, Mystery Science was sold for $175 million after only raising $4 million in venture financing.</p>\n<h2>Using data management and analytics to improve student outcomes<div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=C-7C3KrjkX8:bi4SzolzeBw:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=C-7C3KrjkX8:bi4SzolzeBw:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=C-7C3KrjkX8:bi4SzolzeBw:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=C-7C3KrjkX8:bi4SzolzeBw:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=C-7C3KrjkX8:bi4SzolzeBw:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=C-7C3KrjkX8:bi4SzolzeBw:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=C-7C3KrjkX8:bi4SzolzeBw:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=C-7C3KrjkX8:bi4SzolzeBw:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/C-7C3KrjkX8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 02 Nov 2020 18:10:51 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"da93d01281063c0df978ba61313f5071","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn22@2020_6/2020/11/03/05-31-20-196_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Natasha Mascarenhas","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn22@2020_6/2020/11/03/05-31-20-196_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn96@2020_5/2020/11/03/05-31-35-908_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn52@2020_4/2020/11/03/05-31-34-882_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=C-7C3KrjkX8:bi4SzolzeBw:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn28@2020_6/2020/11/03/05-31-35-946_9f4229edf167a094.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=C-7C3KrjkX8:bi4SzolzeBw:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn15@2020_4/2020/11/03/05-31-34-817_97ae72d493cb7fb9.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn35@2020_5/2020/11/03/05-31-35-960_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/C-7C3KrjkX8":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn16@2020_3/2020/11/03/05-31-34-854_6daabafa7936aecd.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1604381479577},{"createdTime":"2020-11-03 13:31:19","updatedTime":"2020-11-03 13:31:19","title":"NerdWallet acquires small business loan marketplace Fundera","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2068935","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Financial guidance company <a href=\"http://www.nerdwallet.com\">NerdWallet</a> announced at the end of last week that it has acquired <a href=\"http://www.fundera.com\">Fundera</a>.

And it’s easy to see which companies have a newfound interest in automating their workforce amid a seemingly endless virus-driven shutdown. But <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/walmart\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"walmart\">Walmart, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> which has long promised to take an increasing focus on such technology, has reportedly pulled the plug on one of its highest-profile partnerships.</p>\n<p>The mega-retailer has ended a contract with <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/bossa-nova-robotics-inc\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"bossa-nova-robotics-inc\">Bossa Nova Robotics, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> according to new reporting from <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/walmart-shelves-plan-to-have-robots-scan-shelves-11604345341?mod=e2fb&#38;fbclid=IwAR0cNEqLBvbRxHyJNi4RTFmrwyKQrBYP4FQHF4lridWWJHEyPZVhI2yLNhY\">The Wall Street Journal</a>. Walmart had announced in January that it would bring the Bay Area-based startup’s inventory-scanning robots to an additional 650 locations, bringing the total up to 1,000. The move has resulted in layoffs of around 50% at the Carnegie Mellon spin-off, per the WSJ report. It’s a huge hit at a time when such technologies should be thriving.</p>\n<p>Bossa Nova co-founder Sarjoun Skaff didn&#8217;t confirm nor deny the WSJ report, instead issuing a no comment. He did, however, weigh in on the COVID-19 pandemic and its affect on the company, seeming to confirm that some layoffs had indeed occurred.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>&#8220;I cannot comment on Walmart, however, the pandemic has forced us to streamline our operations and focus on our core technologies,&#8221; Skaff said. &#8220;We have made stunning advances in AI and robotics. Our retail AI is the industry&#8217;s best and works as well on robots as with fixed cameras, and our hardware, autonomy and operations excelled in more than 500 of the world&#8217;s most challenging stores. With the board&#8217;s full support, we continue deploying this technology with our partners in retail and in other fields.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The tumult at Bossa Nova has stretched beyond layoffs. Skaff, who was CTO, took over the CEO spot in October when Stuart Pann left the position after less than nine months. Bossa Nova&#8217;s deal with Walmart was a major break for the startup, which began life in 2005 as a robotic toymaker before pivoting into something more serious. The startup&#8217;s relationship with Walmart dates back to 2017, when the chain ordered 50 robots.  Walmart&#8217;s massive order earlier was a major endorsement of Bossa Nova&#8217;s technology.</p>\n<p>Such a change of heart would no doubt have a profound effect on the company.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"kt9OHGOuoe\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/21/sams-club-will-deploy-autonomous-floor-scrubbing-robots-in-all-of-its-u-s-locations/\">Sam’s Club will deploy autonomous floor-scrubbing robots in all of its US locations</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Sam’s Club will deploy autonomous floor-scrubbing robots in all of its US locations&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/21/sams-club-will-deploy-autonomous-floor-scrubbing-robots-in-all-of-its-u-s-locations/embed/#?secret=kt9OHGOuoe\" data-secret=\"kt9OHGOuoe\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>Walmart apparently just wasn’t getting enough out of the deal. Bossa Nova’s robots had made their way into around 500 stores by the time the deal ended — around half of the initial proposed number. As COVID-19 has pushed more orders online, Walmart began exploring ways to use human workers to perform inventory while grabbing product for online fulfillment. Walmart&#8217;s operations, as well as those at other major retailers, will continue to evolve as brick-and-mortar locations reopen and customers shows signs of interest to return to the in-person shopping experience. The volatility of the pandemic still doesn&#8217;t lessen the sting or impact that Walmart&#8217;s abrupt reversal will have on Bossa Nova and its hopes for a rebound.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Walmart’s robotic experiments aren’t over. The company’s Sam’s Club subsidiary recently announced it would bring Tennant’s floor scrubbing robots to all of its 599 stores. Interestingly, the company is also exploring ways for these machines to double up and perform in-store inventory checks; it&#8217;s not clear if these will be used only in Sam&#8217;s Club locations or extend to Walmart stores as well.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"VGUokA3o6d\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/13/bossa-novas-inventory-robots-are-rolling-out-in-1000-walmart-stores/\">Bossa Nova’s inventory robots are rolling out in 1,000 Walmart stores</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Bossa Nova’s inventory robots are rolling out in 1,000 Walmart stores&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/13/bossa-novas-inventory-robots-are-rolling-out-in-1000-walmart-stores/embed/#?secret=VGUokA3o6d\" data-secret=\"VGUokA3o6d\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=hqMwIIuCtHI:PpKGgwg4rbM:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=hqMwIIuCtHI:PpKGgwg4rbM:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=hqMwIIuCtHI:PpKGgwg4rbM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=hqMwIIuCtHI:PpKGgwg4rbM:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=hqMwIIuCtHI:PpKGgwg4rbM:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=hqMwIIuCtHI:PpKGgwg4rbM:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=hqMwIIuCtHI:PpKGgwg4rbM:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=hqMwIIuCtHI:PpKGgwg4rbM:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/hqMwIIuCtHI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 02 Nov 2020 23:53:18 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"629d737a016c0d7d13f4b3a5a48f6bfd","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn22@2020_6/2020/11/03/05-31-20-196_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Brian Heater","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn22@2020_6/2020/11/03/05-31-20-196_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn96@2020_5/2020/11/03/05-31-35-908_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn52@2020_4/2020/11/03/05-31-34-882_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=hqMwIIuCtHI:PpKGgwg4rbM:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn96@2020_6/2020/11/03/05-31-34-731_7f9f36793724db60.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=hqMwIIuCtHI:PpKGgwg4rbM:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn71@2020_5/2020/11/03/05-31-35-021_b4464088f31c57c0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn35@2020_5/2020/11/03/05-31-35-960_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/hqMwIIuCtHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn91@2020_2/2020/11/03/05-31-35-855_70224de99b2da4f7.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1604381479576},{"createdTime":"2020-11-03 13:31:19","updatedTime":"2020-11-03 13:31:19","title":"TikTok strikes new licensing agreement with Sony Music","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2068940","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/tiktok\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"tiktok\">TikTok <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> <a href=\"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-announces-agreement-with-sony-music-entertainment\">announced</a> this morning it has signed a new licensing agreement with Sony Music Entertainment (SME) that will allow the short-form video app to continue to offer songs from <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/sony\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"sony\">Sony <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> Music artists for use by creators on its platform.

This means shippers often have to work with a variety of carriers, driving up costs and making supply chains harder to manage. <a href=\"https://logisly.com/\">Logisly</a>, a Jakarta-based startup that describes itself as a &#8220;B2B tech-enabled logistics platform,&#8221; announced today it has raised $6 million in Series A funding to help streamline logistics in Indonesia.

Its platform digitizes the process of ordering, managing and tracking trucks. First, it verifies carriers before adding them to Logisly&#8217;s platform. Then it connects clients to trucking providers, using an algorithm to aggregate supply and demand. This means companies that need to ship goods can find trucks more quickly, while carriers can reduce the number of unused space on their trucks.</p>\n<p>Co-founder and chief executive officer Roolin Njotosetiadi told TechCrunch that about &#8220;40% of trucks are utilized in Indonesia, and the rest are either sitting idle or coming back from their hauls empty handed.

Back at WWDC in late-June, the company took the unusual step of announcing the technology&#8217;s arrival well-ahead of its launch date, in order to get developers on board with the shift, prior to retail availability. Until now, however, the technology has been limited to the realm of development kits.</p>\n<p>“From the beginning, the Mac has always embraced big changes to stay at the forefront of personal computing. Today we’re announcing our transition to Apple silicon, making this a historic day for the Mac,” Tim Cook said during the announcement. “With its powerful features and industry-leading performance, Apple silicon will make the Mac stronger and more capable than ever.” It seems we&#8217;ll finally see what all of that means next week.</p>\n<p>Recent rumors have pointed to a new version of the MacBook Air set for a Q4 2020 arrival. Redesigned versions of the MacBook Pro and iMac are also reportedly in the works. The early November event is also, notably, Apple&#8217;s last chance to get products announced ahead of the holiday season. As such, it certainly seems possible we could see some other long-rumored products arrive, including its Tile-like AirTags tracking device and over-ear AirPods Studio headphones.</p>\n<p>As always,

id=\"speakable-summary\">One of the most active and notorious data-stealing ransomware groups, Maze, says it is &#8220;officially closed.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The announcement came as a waffling statement, riddled with spelling mistakes and published on its website on the dark web, which for the past year has published vast troves of stolen internal documents and files from the companies it targeted, including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/18/cognizant-maze-ransomware/\">Cognizant</a>, cybersecurity insurance firm <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/26/chubb-insurance-breach-ransomware/\">Chubb</a>, pharmaceutical giant <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/27/execupharm-clop-ransomware/\">ExecuPharm</a>, Tesla and SpaceX parts supplier <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/01/visser-breach/\">Visser</a> and defense contractor <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/26/kimchuk-medical-military-ransomware/\">Kimchuk</a>.</p>\n<p>Where typical ransomware groups would infect a victim with file-encrypting malware and hold the files for a ransom, Maze gained notoriety for first exfiltrating a victim&#8217;s data and threatening to publish the stolen files unless the ransom was paid.</p>\n<p>It quickly <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/08/as-ransomware-gets-craftier-companies-must-start-thinking-creatively/\">became the preferred tactic</a> of ransomware groups, which set up websites — often on the dark web — to leak the files it stole if the victim refused to pay up.</p>\n<p>Maze initially used exploit kits and spam campaigns to infect its victims, but later began using known security vulnerabilities to specifically target big-name companies. Maze was <a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/ransomware-gang-publishes-tens-of-gbs-of-internal-data-from-lg-and-xerox/\">known to use</a> vulnerable virtual private network (VPN) and remote desktop (RDP) servers to launch targeted attacks against its victim&#8217;s network.</p>\n<p>Some of the demanded ransoms reached into the millions of dollars. Maze reportedly <a href=\"https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/maze-ransomware-demands-6-million-ransom-from-southwire/\">demanded $6 million</a> from one Georgia-based wire and cable manufacturer, and <a href=\"https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2020/09/22/mtr-casebook-blocking-a-15-million-maze-ransomware-attack/\">$15 million</a> from one unnamed organization after the group encrypted its network. But after COVID-19 was declared a pandemic in March, Maze — as well as other ransomware groups — promised to <a href=\"https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-gangs-to-stop-attacking-health-orgs-during-pandemic/\">not target hospitals</a> and medical facilities.</p>\n<p>But security experts aren&#8217;t celebrating just yet. After all, ransomware gangs are still criminal enterprises, many of which are driven by profit.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2068836\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2068836\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2068836\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/maze-ransomware-note.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"679\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/maze-ransomware-note.jpg 2542w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/maze-ransomware-note.jpg?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/maze-ransomware-note.jpg?resize=300,199 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/maze-ransomware-note.jpg?resize=768,509 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/maze-ransomware-note.jpg?resize=680,451 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/maze-ransomware-note.jpg?resize=1536,1019 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/maze-ransomware-note.jpg?resize=2048,1358 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/maze-ransomware-note.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2068836\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A statement by the Maze ransomware group, claiming it has shut down. <strong>Screenshot:</strong> TechCrunch</p></div></p>\n<p>&#8220;Obviously, Maze’s claims should be taken with a very, very small pinch of salt,&#8221; said Brett Callow, a ransomware expert and threat analyst at security firm <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/emsisoft\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"emsisoft\">Emsisoft <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a>. &#8220;It&#8217;s certainly possible that the group feels they have made enough money to be able to close shop and sail off into the sunset. However, it&#8217;s also possible — and probably more likely — that they&#8217;ve decided to rebrand.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Callow said the group&#8217;s apparent disbanding leaves open questions about the Maze group&#8217;s connections and involvement with other groups. &#8220;As Maze was an affiliate operation, their partners in crime are unlikely to retire and will instead simply align themselves with another group,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Maze denied that it was a &#8220;cartel&#8221; of ransomware groups in its statement, but experts disagree. Steve Ragan, a security researcher at Akamai, said Maze was known to post on its website data from other ransomware, like Ragnar Locker and the LockBit ransomware-for-hire.</p>\n<p>&#8220;For them to pretend now that there was no team-up or cartel is just plain backwards. Clearly these groups were working together on many levels,&#8221; said Ragan.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The downside to this, and the other significant element, is that nothing will change, Ransomware is still going to be out there,&#8221; said Ragan. &#8220;Criminals are still targeting open access, exposed RDP [remote desktop protocol] and VPN portals, and still sending malicious emails with malicious attachments in the hope of infecting unsuspecting victims on the internet,&#8221;

For example, the company reported what it described as the &#8220;strongest&#8221; pace of growth in its total payment volume in its history.</p>\n<p>In numerical terms, PayPal processed $247 billion, up 38% from the year-ago quarter, and 4 billion payments, up 30% across the same time frame.

Well, tomorrow actually.</p>\n<p>It’s the rare election where the logistics of the election itself seem to be increasingly dominating the discussion. Not since the Florida recount of 2000 have pollsters, analysts and party lawyers been so fixated on the mechanics of ballots. Which ballots will be counted? Will the Post Office deliver mail in time? How many drop-off boxes are authorized by county? Will the voting machines leave an auditable paper trail?</p>\n<p>Voting in America is a complex affair — while presidential elections are national in scope, the actual logistics of ballots and votes are decided locally: not just state by state, but often also county by county. That can create huge variation in the systems at play — but it also means that a small county in rural Mississippi can be a test case for the rest of the nation in how to get voting done right.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>That’s at least what <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/votingworks\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"votingworks\">VotingWorks <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> is banking on.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://voting.works\">VotingWorks</a> is a non-partisan, nonprofit startup that graduated from YC in its winter batch last year with the twin goals of improving the technology that underpins elections through more affordable and secure voting systems as well as using modern statistical science to improve the quality and efficiency of voter audits. The nonprofit scoured the country looking for a testbed, and eventually found Choctaw County in Mississippi, a rural jurisdiction just shy of 10,000 residents who were willing to try VotingWorks’ system in their election.</p>\n<p>Matt Pasternack, who along with Ben Adida co-founded the organization, said that the existing voting machines there were “ancient” and didn’t have a paper audit trail. “We found one county that was so eager to get rid of these ancient machines that they said, ‘Yes, we want to, we want to use this new thing you guys are building,’ ” Pasternack said.</p>\n<p>What VotingWorks built is quite competitive. First, the company used existing hardware rather than designing custom-built hardware that can be extraordinarily costly given that the machines are rarely used in the U.S., which has quadrennial elections for many offices. Second, the organization’s software is <a href=\"https://github.com/votingworks\">posted as open source on GitHub</a>. That made the machines more open and verifiable than competitors, and also available at a lower price point.</p>\n<p>Pasternack and Adida met while working together at Clever, the API middleware platform that today could be dubbed the “Plaid of education,” designed to help app developers connect to the data stored in hundreds of student information systems. Pasternack noted that he was employee number one, and the two talked about politics and elections over the years and eventually saw an opportunity to enter the market with the 2018 midterms.</p>\n<p>The team went through YC in early 2019. With Choctaw County’s push to replace their machines, VotingWorks managed to get its machines in their hands by August for the November 2019 election, when statewide offices, including the governor and attorney general, were up for election. The machines were used in 13 precincts.</p>\n<p>Adida said that the company moved very fast, but the in-field experience was crucial for improving their machines. He noted that one thing the crew learned is that on election day, poll workers have to set up each machine in the morning before the first rush of voters. The speed of setup is crucial for getting poll places ready, and so VotingWorks optimized how many steps were involved in setting up each ballot machine. “With our machines, you put it on a table, you pop open the case, and you run the checklist. It takes about two-to-three minutes, compared to 30 [minutes] … and so the poll workers were raving about it,” he said.</p>\n<p>Pasternack also added that in a rural county like Choctaw, power constraints added their own complexity. Precincts could be remarkably underpowered, and too many voting machines on one electrical circuit could blow out the entire precinct — preventing anyone from voting.</p>\n<p>Since then, the organization’s technology has expanded to about 10% of Mississippi counties, partly driven by the need this year for color printing technology. The state is voting on changing its state flag to remove the imprint of the Confederate flag, and voters have to see the new flags in color on the ballot. Pasternack said that their on-demand printing technology is both efficient and much more affordable per ballot.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2068882\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2068882\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2068882\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/MS-Flag.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"211\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/MS-Flag.png 3211w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/MS-Flag.png?resize=150,47 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/MS-Flag.png?resize=300,93 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/MS-Flag.png?resize=768,238 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/MS-Flag.png?resize=680,211 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/MS-Flag.png?resize=1536,477 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/MS-Flag.png?resize=2048,636 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/MS-Flag.png?resize=50,16 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2068882\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Mississippi&#8217;s Existing Flag and proposed new flag that will be on the state&#8217;s ballot tomorrow.

Each of these technologies work independently of one another — Adida stressed that “An important trait of a modern voting system is that it&#8217;s modular.

With so much focus on election logistics this year, the hope is that more counties and states will begin to think through better, more robust systems to operate their elections. “We want a world where the foundation of democracy is publicly owned, so having open-source software shepherded by a nonprofit organization — it feels like a better democracy to me,” Adida said.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/tag/2020-election/\"><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/us-2020-election-footer.png\" /></a></p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=iEi942mw93A:uH8lootEB14:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=iEi942mw93A:uH8lootEB14:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=iEi942mw93A:uH8lootEB14:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=iEi942mw93A:uH8lootEB14:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=iEi942mw93A:uH8lootEB14:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=iEi942mw93A:uH8lootEB14:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=iEi942mw93A:uH8lootEB14:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=iEi942mw93A:uH8lootEB14:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/iEi942mw93A\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 02 Nov 2020 18:36:35 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/MS-Flag.png?w=680","linkMd5":"bd548d39b955d5df82196ca2a96a5227","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn18@2020_6/2020/11/03/05-31-20-216_3baf11fc9db9c26f.webp","destWidth":680,"destHeight":211,"sourceBytes":18484,"destBytes":18484,"author":"Danny Crichton","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/MS-Flag.png?w=680":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn18@2020_6/2020/11/03/05-31-20-216_3baf11fc9db9c26f.webp","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/us-2020-election-footer.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn45@2020_3/2020/11/03/05-31-36-228_f68d83017a52e30b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn22@2020_6/2020/11/03/05-31-20-196_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn96@2020_5/2020/11/03/05-31-35-908_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn52@2020_4/2020/11/03/05-31-34-882_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=iEi942mw93A:uH8lootEB14:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn58@2020_4/2020/11/03/05-31-36-201_f8f383db4f62a237.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=iEi942mw93A:uH8lootEB14:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn100@2020_2/2020/11/03/05-31-36-037_b29b5edced34a8d8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn35@2020_5/2020/11/03/05-31-35-960_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/iEi942mw93A":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn74@2020_3/2020/11/03/05-31-35-922_4c750f214e8645b5.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1604381479577},{"createdTime":"2020-11-03 13:31:19","updatedTime":"2020-11-03 13:31:19","title":"Rocket Lab’s next launch will deliver 30 satellites to orbit — and a 3D-printed gnome from Gabe Newell","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2068886","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/rocket-lab\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"rocket-lab\">Rocket Lab&#8217;s <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> next mission will put dozens of satellites into orbit using the launch company&#8217;s Kick Stage &#8220;space tug,&#8221; as well as a 3D-printed garden gnome from Valve Software&#8217;s Gabe Newell.

The figure, a replica of an item from the popular Half-Life series of PC games, was made by Weta Workshop, the effects studio behind Lord of the Rings and many other films. It&#8217;s both a test of a potentially useful new component printing technique and &#8220;an homage to the innovation and creativity of gamers worldwide.&#8221;</p>\n<p>More importantly, Newell will donate a dollar to Starship Children&#8217;s Hospital for every viewer of the launch, so you&#8217;ll definitely want to tune in for this one.
