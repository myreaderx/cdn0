Then it&#8217;s time for November, a month where many of us will either be relieved <em>or</em> horrified (you know why). Also: it&#8217;ll be time for Thanksgiving, but since the pandemic is still raging, who the hell knows how we&#8217;ll go about that. But enough of these real-world issues – let&#8217;s talk about entertainment! A new month brings with it new titles on Disney+ and Hulu, and here they are! Get a rundown of the best TV shows and movies coming to Hulu and Disney+ below.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-641672\"></span></p>\n<h2>Best TV Shows and Movies Coming to Hulu and Disney+ in November 2020</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-season-3-filming.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-641554\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-season-3-filming-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"mandalorian season 3 filming\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-season-3-filming-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-season-3-filming-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-season-3-filming-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-season-3-filming.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<h2><strong>The Mandalorian Season 2</strong></h2>\n<p>I don&#8217;t care for <em>The Mandalorian – </em>I tried three episodes and gave up. But I know I&#8217;m in the minority there, and I am required by law to mention it, so here we are: season 2! Technically, season 2 starts in October – October 30, to be exact. But the majority of the second season will air in November. And what happens this season? Well: &#8220;The Mandalorian and the Child continue their journey, facing enemies and rallying allies as they make their way through a dangerous galaxy in the tumultuous era after the collapse of the Galactic Empire.&#8221; (All Month on Disney+)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/tesla-movie-review.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-632842\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/tesla-movie-review-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"tesla movie review\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/tesla-movie-review.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/tesla-movie-review-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<h2><strong>Tesla</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Michael Almereyda</strong>&#8216;s highly unconventional biopic of Nikola Tesla features karaoke, an ice cream fight, and a narrator performing Google searches. It&#8217;s the cure for the boring, standard biopic, with <strong>Ethan Hawke</strong> turning in yet another great performance. The film follows Tesla as he breaks away from Thomas Edison to form his own electrical inventions. It has a similar set-up as <em>The Current War</em>, but while that movie followed a by-the-numbers approach, Almereyda is going for something more surreal and abstract.  (November 20 on Hulu)</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/MV5BYTQyZGQzZDMtNWMwYi00NzlhLWFhZWQtNzk3YTUyNzA2ZGRiL2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDQ2Njk1Ng@@._V1_.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-641690\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/MV5BYTQyZGQzZDMtNWMwYi00NzlhLWFhZWQtNzk3YTUyNzA2ZGRiL2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDQ2Njk1Ng@@._V1_-700x295.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"295\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/MV5BYTQyZGQzZDMtNWMwYi00NzlhLWFhZWQtNzk3YTUyNzA2ZGRiL2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDQ2Njk1Ng@@._V1_-700x295.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/MV5BYTQyZGQzZDMtNWMwYi00NzlhLWFhZWQtNzk3YTUyNzA2ZGRiL2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDQ2Njk1Ng@@._V1_-360x152.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/MV5BYTQyZGQzZDMtNWMwYi00NzlhLWFhZWQtNzk3YTUyNzA2ZGRiL2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDQ2Njk1Ng@@._V1_-768x324.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/MV5BYTQyZGQzZDMtNWMwYi00NzlhLWFhZWQtNzk3YTUyNzA2ZGRiL2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDQ2Njk1Ng@@._V1_.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<h2><strong>Ronin</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>John Frankenheime</strong>r&#8217;s ass-kicking action thriller <strong><em>Ronin</em></strong> has <strong>Robert De Nir</strong>o as part of a team of former special operatives trying to steal a suitcase. What&#8217;s in the case? Honestly, it doesn&#8217;t matter – it&#8217;s just a MacGuffin to get the narrative moving, and move it does. While this film isn&#8217;t a wall-to-wall action pic, it features one of the coolest car chase sequences ever caught on film. And best of all, De Niro isn&#8217;t phoning it in – something he did frequently in the 1990s, unfortuantely.

But hey, at least we got this one movie which features <strong>Ryan Gosling</strong> and <strong>Russell Crowe</strong> as a pair of private eyes in 1970s Los Angeles. Like all Shane Black movies, the script is twisty and funny, with all of the many pieces Black puts in place neatly coming together in the end. This movie also bests what might be Gosling&#8217;s best performance, as the actor channels Lou Costello to reveal his serious comic chops. (November 9 on Hulu)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Much-Ado-About-Nothing-2.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-641691\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Much-Ado-About-Nothing-2-700x380.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"380\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Much-Ado-About-Nothing-2-700x380.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Much-Ado-About-Nothing-2-360x195.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Much-Ado-About-Nothing-2-768x417.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<h2><strong>Much Ado About Nothing </strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Kenneth Branagh</strong>&#8216;s breezy, star-studded adaptation of Shakespeare&#8217;s comedy of errors has an evil <strong>Keanu Reeves</strong> playing the brother of a suave <strong>Denzel Washington</strong>.

Get more details about the new season below.<span id=\"more-641661\"></span></p>\n<p>According to an HBO press release, the Emmy-winning, Academy Award nominated team of <strong>Jehane Noujaim</strong> and <strong>Karim Amer</strong> will be back to direct and executive produce the new batch of episodes, which will premiere on HBO and be available to watch on the HBO Max streaming service afterward. The new season continues the story, diving into the trial of one of the key players in the NXIVM cult:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Set against the backdrop of the federal trial of The United States against Keith Raniere, THE VOW Part Two will offer an exclusive view into Raniere&#8217;s innermost circle. It delves into the stories of NXIVM’s top leadership in the US and Mexico, and into powerful, intimate stories of DOS members. Part Two follows the legal and emotional journeys of the group&#8217;s founders, supporters and defectors as new evidence and stunning revelations come to light while federal prosecutors and defense attorneys battle for opposing views of justice in a case caught in the national spotlight.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This sounds very much like a <em>Making a Murderer</em> season 2 scenario, and I have to wonder if the same fate is in store for this show that befell that gigantic Netflix water cooler hit. The audience was simply not interested in a second season in the same way that they were hooked by the first season, and based on everything I&#8217;ve heard about <em>The Vow</em> so far, it seems like it could end up running into that same hurdle.</p>\n<p>The story <em>The Vow</em> is telling is fascinating, but every reaction I&#8217;ve seen says the same thing: it has stretched its story thin with too many episodes, and it would have been a much better show if it had found a way to trim the fat and compress this information into a shorter number of episodes. So the fact that the show is doing the opposite and adding even more episodes to its plate seems a little disheartening – though, to be fair to the series, Keith Raniere is still currently awaiting sentencing (which is expected to happen this fall), so maybe they&#8217;ll be able to tackle this new chapter about his trial in a more succinct way.</p>\n<p><em>The Vow</em> season one finale airs on HBO on <strong>October 18</strong>, <strong>2020</strong>.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/31rSR0w0z30?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-vow-part-two/\">&#8216;The Vow Part Two&#8217; Will Continue to Explore NXIVM with More Episodes in 2021</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=5p5znTXVxtI:Q2iUfhK_Um0:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=5p5znTXVxtI:Q2iUfhK_Um0:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=5p5znTXVxtI:Q2iUfhK_Um0:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=5p5znTXVxtI:Q2iUfhK_Um0:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=5p5znTXVxtI:Q2iUfhK_Um0:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=5p5znTXVxtI:Q2iUfhK_Um0:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/5p5znTXVxtI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 16 Oct 2020 18:00:23 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/The-Vow-Part-Two-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"88aeda90cffb5b3da5f927e8580e150e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn10@2020_1/2020/10/17/02-29-58-486_101eba1455aeccbc.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":59767,"destBytes":46674,"author":"Ben Pearson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/The-Vow-Part-Two-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn10@2020_1/2020/10/17/02-29-58-486_101eba1455aeccbc.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn16@2020_2/2020/10/17/02-30-18-778_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=5p5znTXVxtI:Q2iUfhK_Um0:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn31@2020_6/2020/10/17/02-30-18-781_8a8242883852d2f5.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn35@2020_1/2020/10/17/02-30-19-618_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=5p5znTXVxtI:Q2iUfhK_Um0:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn63@2020_6/2020/10/17/02-30-19-465_a6976eebc1a8546d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/5p5znTXVxtI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn87@2020_5/2020/10/17/02-30-18-625_6c4ff96005de212c.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602901784084},{"createdTime":"2020-10-17 10:29:44","updatedTime":"2020-10-17 10:29:44","title":"‘The Empty Man’ Trailer: Here’s the Supernatural Horror Movie That Disney is Quietly Dumping in Theaters This Month","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=641596","description":"<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-641597\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/DF-00666-e1602854944337-700x323.jpg\" alt=\"the empty man trailer\" width=\"700\" height=\"323\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/DF-00666-e1602854944337-700x323.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/DF-00666-e1602854944337-360x166.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/DF-00666-e1602854944337-768x355.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/DF-00666-e1602854944337.jpg 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Poor <strong><em>The Empty Man</em></strong>.

Del Rey, <em>The Empty Man </em>centers around an urban legend in a small Midwestern town, and a group of teens who begin to mysteriously disappear. <strong>James Badge Dale</strong> (<em>Iron Man 3</em>), <strong>Stephen Root</strong> (<em>Barry</em>), and <strong>Joel Courtney</strong> (<em>Super 8</em>) star in the movie, which is written and directed by David Prior.</p>\n<p>It seems like <em>The Empty Man</em> is getting the <em>New Mutants</em> treatment — a leftover from the Disney-Fox merger that will get dropped quietly to theaters. Theaters that are barely operating at the moment due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, which doesn&#8217;t bode well for the box office receipts for <em>The Empty Man</em>. But as a mid-budget horror movie that would have been inappropriate for the family-friendly Disney+ and unlikely to make a big splash at the box office anyway, perhaps this was the best solution for <em>The Empty Man</em>. At least they got a trailer for their troubles.</p>\n<p>Here is the synopsis for <em>The Empty Man</em>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>20th Century Studios’ “The Empty Man” is a supernatural horror film based on a popular series of Boom! Studios graphic novels. After a group of teens from a small Midwestern town begin to mysteriously disappear, the locals believe it is the work of an urban legend known as The Empty Man. As a retired cop investigates and struggles to make sense of the stories, he discovers a secretive group and their attempts to summon a horrific, mystical entity, and soon his life—and the lives of those close to him—are in grave danger. Directed by David Prior from a screen story and screenplay by David Prior based on the graphic novel by Cullen Bunn, “The Empty Man” stars James Badge Dale, Marin Ireland, Stephen Root, Ron Canada, Robert Aramayo, Joel Courtney and Sasha Frolova. The film is produced by Ross Richie, p.g.a. and Stephen Christy, p.g.a.</p></blockquote>\n<p><em>The Empty Man</em> opens in U.S. theaters on <strong>October 23, 2020</strong>. Advance tickets for <em>The Empty Man</em> go on sale today and can be purchased anywhere tickets are sold.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-empty-man-trailer/\">&#8216;The Empty Man&#8217; Trailer: Here&#8217;s the Supernatural Horror Movie That Disney is Quietly Dumping in Theaters This Month</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=BbqNuK329ZE:1tjDLeLyqwI:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=BbqNuK329ZE:1tjDLeLyqwI:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=BbqNuK329ZE:1tjDLeLyqwI:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=BbqNuK329ZE:1tjDLeLyqwI:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=BbqNuK329ZE:1tjDLeLyqwI:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=BbqNuK329ZE:1tjDLeLyqwI:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/BbqNuK329ZE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 16 Oct 2020 21:00:06 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/DF-00666-e1602854944337-700x323.jpg","linkMd5":"17c901118a4ad6d5b3c070b6642c5f3f","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn47@2020_5/2020/10/17/02-30-02-041_2b94d210d0da40d6.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":323,"sourceBytes":33387,"destBytes":20860,"author":"Hoai-Tran Bui","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/DF-00666-e1602854944337-700x323.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn47@2020_5/2020/10/17/02-30-02-041_2b94d210d0da40d6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn16@2020_2/2020/10/17/02-30-18-778_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=BbqNuK329ZE:1tjDLeLyqwI:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn88@2020_5/2020/10/17/02-30-18-562_5a150747ed79138a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn35@2020_1/2020/10/17/02-30-19-618_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=BbqNuK329ZE:1tjDLeLyqwI:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn51@2020_3/2020/10/17/02-30-19-423_daa6b4afeda2a91f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/BbqNuK329ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn67@2020_6/2020/10/17/02-30-19-462_9158cfb2f6d8ddef.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602901784083},{"createdTime":"2020-10-17 10:29:44","updatedTime":"2020-10-17 10:29:44","title":"‘Grease’ Prequel Series Slides From HBO Max to Paramount+","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=641478","description":"<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-641492 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Grease-Rise-of-the-Pink-Ladies-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"Grease Rise of the Pink Ladies\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Grease-Rise-of-the-Pink-Ladies.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Grease-Rise-of-the-Pink-Ladies-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Grease is the word over at Paramount+.</p>\n<p>The CBS All Access streaming service is <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/cbs-all-access-paramount-2021/\">changing its name to Paramount+</a> early next year, and it has just picked up a new show to add to its roster. <em>Grease: Rydell High</em>, a prequel series set before the events of the 1978 classic musical starring John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John, has received some rebranding of its own: the show is now called <em><strong>Grease: Rise of the Pink Ladies</strong></em>, and it is moving from HBO Max over to Paramount+.<br />\n<span id=\"more-641478\"></span></p>\n<p>A year ago, <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/grease-tv-series-going-back-to-rydel-high/\">word came out</a> that a prequel series called <em>Grease: Rydell High</em> had been ordered by WarnerMedia for its HBO Max platform. Now <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/grease-prequel-series-moves-to-paramount-from-hbo-max\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Hollywood Reporter</a> says the show has a new name – <em>Grease: Rise of the Pink Ladies</em> – a new home at Paramount+, and a new concept to boot. The original plan for the show was for it to be &#8220;set in and around the world of Rydell High&#8221; and to &#8220;reimagine the global smash hit movie with some characters you already know, and a whole lot more you will soon meet.&#8221; Now, as the new title indicates, it will focus on the rise of the jacket-wearing girl gang the Pink Ladies, and track how &#8220;Sandy, Rizzo, Jan, Marty and Frenchy came together and how the reverence, fear and moral panic they sparked changed Rydell forever.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Annabel Oakes</strong> (<em>Awkward</em>), who was on board in the early <em>Rydell High</em> days, is still on board as the creator/writer/executive producer for this revamped version of the show. Former WarnerMedia head Bob Greenblatt gave the show a straight-to-series order last November, but a major shakeup at that company has now put HBO&#8217;s Casey Bloys in charge, and apparently he felt differently about this series, so HBO Max changed its mind and let the show go. But since it&#8217;s being produced in part by Paramount Television, Paramount+ seems like a natural new home for the series.</p>\n<p>Paramount Television is producing with Picturestart and Temple Hill, and weirdly, those three companies are also working on a <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/grease-prequel-summer-loving/\"><em>Grease</em> prequel movie</a> called <em>Summer Lovin&#8217;</em>, which inexplicably aims to tell the story of how Danny Zuko (Travolta) and Sandy Olsson (Newton-John) first met. Their whirlwind summer romance, of course, was already detailed in the original movie, leaving us wondering why it needs to be elaborated on at all. It&#8217;s unclear if that movie will directly cross over with or tie in to this new <em>Grease Rise of the Pink Ladies</em> series.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/grease-rise-of-the-pink-ladies/\">&#8216;Grease&#8217; Prequel Series Slides From HBO Max to Paramount+</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=74YpBoIuVjE:wwUoeH8DtC0:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=74YpBoIuVjE:wwUoeH8DtC0:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=74YpBoIuVjE:wwUoeH8DtC0:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=74YpBoIuVjE:wwUoeH8DtC0:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=74YpBoIuVjE:wwUoeH8DtC0:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=74YpBoIuVjE:wwUoeH8DtC0:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/74YpBoIuVjE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 16 Oct 2020 20:30:11 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Grease-Rise-of-the-Pink-Ladies-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"a1ef18f612808e933ad53561eaf57716","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn55@2020_5/2020/10/17/02-30-16-333_5076f67f443ec2a4.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":27215,"destBytes":16396,"author":"Ben Pearson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Grease-Rise-of-the-Pink-Ladies-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn55@2020_5/2020/10/17/02-30-16-333_5076f67f443ec2a4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn16@2020_2/2020/10/17/02-30-18-778_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=74YpBoIuVjE:wwUoeH8DtC0:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn48@2020_6/2020/10/17/02-30-19-695_807aacc429232a23.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn35@2020_1/2020/10/17/02-30-19-618_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=74YpBoIuVjE:wwUoeH8DtC0:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn19@2020_2/2020/10/17/02-30-18-648_610a5e47110ef2f5.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/74YpBoIuVjE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn100@2020_4/2020/10/17/02-30-18-519_38b4fcd59561714f.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602901784082},{"createdTime":"2020-10-17 10:29:44","updatedTime":"2020-10-17 10:29:44","title":"Disney+ Expands Advisory Warning for Racist Content on Titles Like ‘Peter Pan,’ ‘Dumbo’","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=641632","description":"<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-641637\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/peter-pan-5-e1602862623615-700x353.jpg\" alt=\"disney+ content warning\" width=\"700\" height=\"353\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/peter-pan-5-e1602862623615-700x353.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/peter-pan-5-e1602862623615-360x181.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/peter-pan-5-e1602862623615-768x387.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/peter-pan-5-e1602862623615.jpg 1596w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Disney</strong> has had a long history of retrograde depictions of people of color in their classic animated films — an issue that the company has been grappling with for decades. See: the saga of Disney&#8217;s famously racist 1946 film <em>Song of the South</em>, which has been both promoted and hidden by the company at various intervals throughout the years.</p>\n<p>But unlike Disney&#8217;s treatment of <em>Song of the South</em>, which Disney has made a concerted effort to make unavailable on home video and streaming, the House of Mouse is attempting to have a fuller conversation about the racist elements of its beloved classics like <em><strong>Peter Pan</strong>, <strong>Dumbo</strong></em>, and <strong><em>The Aristocats</em></strong>. The company is expanding is <strong>Disney+</strong> content warning to these three films, improving and enhancing its advisory label to include &#8220;negative depictions&#8221; and deeper dives into the cultural context of the titles.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-641632\"></span></p>\n<p>Disney+ <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/disney-host/\">first introduced</a> its warning label for classic films that contained &#8220;outdated cultural depictions&#8221; in 2019, adding warnings to films such as <em>Dumbo</em> (1941), <em>Lady and the Tramp</em> (1955), <em>The Jungle Book</em> (1967), and <em>The Aristocats</em>. The advisory label was met with some divided opinion, but it was a better move than just leaving out the films completely or cutting the dated scenes in question — which streamers like Netflix have done in order to avoid the &#8220;discourse.&#8221; This way, at least a conversation can be had about why these elements are troubling — and Disney+ is smartly looking to continue that conversation with an expanded content warning label.</p>\n<p>Here is the new, full text on the content warnings on Disney+ (via <a href=\"https://collider.com/disney-plus-warning-label-explained/\">Collider</a>):</p>\n<p><em>This program includes negative depictions and/or mistreatment of people or cultures. These stereotypes were wrong then and are wrong now. Rather than remove this content, we want to acknowledge its harmful impact, learn from it and spark conversation to create a more inclusive future together.</em></p>\n<p><em>Disney is committed to creating stories with inspirational and aspirational themes that reflect the rich diversity of the human experience around the globe.</em></p>\n<p><em>To learn more about how stories have impacted society, please visit <a href=\"http://www.disney.com/StoriesMatter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">www.disney.com/StoriesMatter</a></em></p>\n<p>The link at the end of the text takes you to a website that gives deeper examinations of the cultural stereotypes that show up in classic Disney titles, including <em>The Aristocats</em>, <em>Peter Pan</em>, and <em>Dumbo</em>, and explain the historical context and negative aspects of these depictions. The page promises how Disney is planning to change representation in the future:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Stories shape how we see ourselves and everyone around us. So as storytellers, we have the power and responsibility to not only uplift and inspire, but also consciously, purposefully and relentlessly champion the spectrum of voices and perspectives in our world… We can’t change the past, but we can acknowledge it, learn from it and move forward together to create a tomorrow that today can only dream of.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>It also lists the social justice groups Disney is working with on this new initiative, including The AAFCA, CAPE, Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media, GLAAD Media Institute, IllumiNative, NALIP, RespectAbility, and more.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s admirable that Disney is not trying to sweep these issues under the rug by including this expanded advisory warning, especially after the company has been in hot water for serious issues like the <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/disney-backlash-mulan-credits-ccp-coronavirus/\">politically thorny production of <em>Mulan</em></a>. While it doesn&#8217;t make up for all of the company&#8217;s past issues, it&#8217;s good to know that Disney is willing to have these conversations instead of painting over its past.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/disney-content-warning-expands-racism/\">Disney+ Expands Advisory Warning for Racist Content on Titles Like &#8216;Peter Pan,&#8217; &#8216;Dumbo&#8217;</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=3TZtT9jFOqE:YzKByLqjoQc:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=3TZtT9jFOqE:YzKByLqjoQc:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=3TZtT9jFOqE:YzKByLqjoQc:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=3TZtT9jFOqE:YzKByLqjoQc:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=3TZtT9jFOqE:YzKByLqjoQc:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=3TZtT9jFOqE:YzKByLqjoQc:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/3TZtT9jFOqE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 16 Oct 2020 20:00:35 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/peter-pan-5-e1602862623615-700x353.jpg","linkMd5":"234c2e4a6232faefa57aa36f8f6c81fa","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn5@2020_6/2020/10/17/02-30-08-827_53d47bb71443a780.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":353,"sourceBytes":59495,"destBytes":41022,"author":"Hoai-Tran Bui","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/peter-pan-5-e1602862623615-700x353.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn5@2020_6/2020/10/17/02-30-08-827_53d47bb71443a780.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn16@2020_2/2020/10/17/02-30-18-778_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=3TZtT9jFOqE:YzKByLqjoQc:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn72@2020_2/2020/10/17/02-30-18-803_b629639273c290f2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn35@2020_1/2020/10/17/02-30-19-618_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=3TZtT9jFOqE:YzKByLqjoQc:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn84@2020_5/2020/10/17/02-30-18-687_c2a0ef0d3d55df5f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/3TZtT9jFOqE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn4@2020_6/2020/10/17/02-30-19-508_7c03e3b6d8b9b2a5.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602901784083},{"createdTime":"2020-10-17 10:29:44","updatedTime":"2020-10-17 10:29:44","title":"Superhero Bits: DC Comics Introducing a Brazilian Wonder Woman, Daredevil Joins ‘Fortnite’ & More","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=641675","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-641727 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/wonderwoman-brazilian-futurestate-700x316.jpg\" alt=\"Wonder Woman - Future State\" width=\"700\" height=\"316\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/wonderwoman-brazilian-futurestate.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/wonderwoman-brazilian-futurestate-360x163.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Who is this new Brazilian <strong>Wonder Woman</strong> from the DC Comics series <strong><em>Future State</em></strong>?

That&#8217;s how long you have to watch these movies before they vanish from Hulu – possibly forever. Will these cinematic classics ever return to that specific streaming service? Who can say? Streaming rights are nebulous things. So it&#8217;s probably for the best to carve out some time and watch these before you have to fire up a different streaming service – or, worse, re-activate your Netflix by mail DVD plan – in order to see them.

What a ludicrous piece of fiction! Such a laughable idea! But seriously folks, <em>Absolute Power</em> is the type of solid, down-the-middle thriller for adults that Hollywood used to pump out all the time but have become all-too-rare these days. <strong>Clint Eastwood</strong> directs and stars, and you should give this one a shot before it disappears. Go ahead&#8230;make his day.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-327145 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/movie-fan-controversies-header-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"movie fan controversies\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/movie-fan-controversies-header.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/movie-fan-controversies-header-360x154.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/movie-fan-controversies-header-435x186.jpg 435w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<h2>Casino Royale</h2>\n<p>This is the best James Bond movie, hands down. <em>Goldfinger</em>? Get outta here. <em>From Russia With Love</em>? Take a seat, pal. <em>Skyfall</em>? More like <em>Cry-all</em>, as in &#8220;<em>Skyfall</em> will <em>cry all</em> day because it can&#8217;t hold a candle to <em>Casino Royale</em>.&#8221; A Bond movie has never been more visceral, sexy, or romantic than Martin Campbell&#8217;s 2006 reboot of the franchise, introducing Daniel Craig as agent 007.

This type of no-holds-barred, big-budget action filmmaking rarely happens these days unless it&#8217;s buried in a piece of familiar intellectual property. But watching Sylvester Stallone, Sandra Bullock, and Wesley Snipes battle it out in this futuristic macho movie is a throwback worth seeing at least once. Drop us a line if you can figure out the seashell thing.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-473015 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/deep-blue-sea-netflix-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"deep blue sea netflix\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/deep-blue-sea-netflix.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/deep-blue-sea-netflix-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<h2>Deep Blue Sea</h2>\n<p>This movie is goofy at points, but it&#8217;s also genuinely thrilling, which is about all you can ask for from a movie about scientists who want to use sharks to cure Alzheimer&#8217;s but who end up making them into even more efficient killing machines. That Sam Jackson moment is legendary for a reason, but there&#8217;s a lot more to this movie than just that twist and that speech. Dive in and give it a shot before it swims away.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-536720 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/evil-dead-2-4k-trailer-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"evil dead 2 4k trailer\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/evil-dead-2-4k-trailer-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/evil-dead-2-4k-trailer-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/evil-dead-2-4k-trailer-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/evil-dead-2-4k-trailer.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<h2>Evil Dead II</h2>\n<p>Sam Raimi&#8217;s masterpiece didn&#8217;t so much build on the groundwork he laid in the first film as it ripped up the foundation, gave it a fresh coat of paint, and rebuilt it from scratch.I know foundations don&#8217;t need paint. The point is, Raimi revamped his cabin in the woods horror film into something that is more in line with his directorial temperament, and made a movie that will forever be perfectly representative of the type of fun-loving, genre-embracing director he&#8217;s always been.</p>\n<h2><strong><a href=\"http://www.slashfilm.com/movies-leaving-hulu-in-november-2020/2/\"><strong>Continue Reading Movies

Ultra HD, the highest quality release of the trilogy yet. Thankfully, this isn&#8217;t just a casual re-release without any new bonus materials. Since this year marks the 35th anniversary of the original time travel adventure, there&#8217;s a new disc chock full of bonus features that no one has every seen before, and a sneak peek at one of them has just been revealed. Watch it below.<span id=\"more-641655\"></span></p>\n<h2>Back to the Future Trilogy Featurette</h2>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2bYP98IIono?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>This clip comes from a tour of the<em> Back to the Future</em> exhibit at The Hollywood Museum with trilogy co-writer and producer <strong>Bob Gale</strong>. In this featurette, you&#8217;ll get a close look at some of the props used in all three of the movies, along with anecdotes and memories of how they came to be, and whether or not some of the future props turned out to have accurate predictions about the future.</p>\n<p>For example, in the clip above, Gale recalls how they spoke to Jeffries Banknote, the real company that makes American currency, to find out how money might change in the future. They accurately predicted that the heads of the presidents would be bigger and that there will be magnetic strips and foil elements to help prevent forgery.

But the name can strike fear into the hearts of (fictional) police and affection in the hearts of many Japanese audiences, who have grown up with the long-running heist franchise centering around a charismatic master thief.</p>\n<p>Created by Monkey Punch in 1967, Arsène Lupin III was introduced as the grandson of Arsène Lupin, the gentleman thief of Maurice Leblanc&#8217;s series of novels. But as a product of the &#8217;60s, Lupin III was daring, sexy, smug, and a little bit silly — a mix of James Bond and Casanova. Monkey Punch&#8217;s manga character would take off in popularity, spawning a franchise that spanned anime, video games, and feature films both animated and live-action. But there was one medium that <em>Lupin the Third</em> hadn&#8217;t dominated yet: 3D animation.</p>\n<p>Enter filmmaker <strong>Takashi Yamazaki</strong>, the director of dramas like <em>Always: Sunset on Third Street</em> who would make the leap to CG animation and become on of Japan&#8217;s foremost directors in 3D-CG. With the blessing of Monkey Punch, who expressed a wish to see his creation in 3D before he passed in April last year, Yamazaki breathed three dimensions into the 2D character with his upcoming film <strong><em>Lupin III: The First</em></strong>.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-641590\"></span></p>\n<p><em>Lupin III: The First</em> is the first theatrical <em>Lupin</em> release in 24 years, and the first to hit U.S. theaters since Miyazaki&#8217;s 1979 debut film <em>The Castle of Cagliostro</em>. The pressure was on for Yamazaki to not only deliver the first 3D take on an iconic Japanese character, but to live up to a classic film directed by a Japanese anime titan.  Yamazaki actually takes inspiration from <em>The Castle of Cagliostro</em> — from its globe-trotting scale, its nostalgic themes, and its dynamic capers — which was the first film that made him understand &#8220;what anime can do.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I has the opportunity to speak with Yamazaki for /Film, and we talked about his unenviable task of bringing the character into 3D and the inspirations he brought to <em>Lupin III: The First</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>You are one of Japan&#8217;s leading directors in 3D-CG animation, with films like <em>Dragon Quest</em> and <em>Stand By Me Doraemon</em> bringing anime into 3D. But because <em>Lupin III </em>has a very specific art style created by Monkey Punch, was there a different process or approach you had to take to adapt <em>Lupin III</em>?</strong></p>\n<p><em>Lupin</em> is a property that I&#8217;ve watched since I was a kid, so when I was asked to do work on this project, I was really fascinated and really excited. I wanted to do a <em>Lupin</em> movie. And, you know, since I&#8217;m not a to hand drawn animation director, I really didn&#8217;t think that I would be able to direct <em>Lupin</em> unless it was CG so I really just jumped on this opportunity to work on it. And, actually, Monkey Punch, he was really understanding of the technique and art of CG films so he was actually looking forward to how it was coming out and it&#8217;s really too bad that he passed away right before the release. But he was also excited too.</p>\n<p><strong>The film is dedicated to Monkey Punch, who had expressed the wish to see <em>Lupin III</em> brought to 3D-CG before he passed away. Did you feel pressure bringing Monkey Punch&#8217;s vision to 3D animation?</strong></p>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t really feel pressure, but I was really conscious of making sure that Lupin looked like Lupin when he turned into CG. Not just about but all the characters, I really wanted to make sure that once we made him into a 3D model, all the fans would not say, or even Monkey Punch would not say, &#8220;Oh, that doesn&#8217;t look like him.&#8221; So, not just for Monkey Punch but for everyone in the world collectively, I was really conscious of making sure to keep the characteristics.</p>\n<p><strong>What specific characteristics did you think were particularly important to retain during that adaptation process?</strong></p>\n<p>I really adapted to the looks, like the facial features. Because we&#8217;re [adapting] flat 2D into 3D, we really just had to make small adjustments here and there when modeling the characters. Another thing is their expressions, right? So we put the old Lupin images side by side with what we&#8217;re creating, to make sure that even if we had to break a lot of rules in the usual modeling process, we wanted to make sure that he expressed his facial features really well. We had legendary animators who worked on <em>Lupin</em> before or are still working on Lupin, we had them check to see if it was <em>Lupin</em>-like and made small adjustments based on that.</p>\n<p><strong>Although Lupin III is very popular in Japan, it&#8217;s probably best known to American audiences by Hayao Miyazaki&#8217;s 1979 movie <em>The Castle of Cagliostro</em>. Your film takes inspiration from <em>Castle of Cagliostro</em> as well, in its themes and locales. What is it about <em>Castle of Cagliostro</em> that remains so appealing and made you decide to draw inspiration from it?</strong></p>\n<p>I actually didn&#8217;t watch [Cagliostro] in theaters. It was actually not doing well in theaters in Japan at the time, so I didn&#8217;t think highly of the movie. When I saw it on TV I was really just casually watching it… But then, once I started watching it, it was so good. Towards the end of the movie I was sitting up on my knees, watching it intensely at the end. And that was actually the first film that I first found out about Mr. Miyazaki. At the time I really had more respect for Hollywood films — it was in the 80s, so like Spielberg etc. But then watching Miyazaki&#8217;s <em>Lupin, </em>I realized, &#8220;Oh, you know what, in Japan, we could make high quality films too in animation.&#8221; So I really understood what anime can do.</p>\n<p><strong>You&#8217;ve stated that other inspirations in your film include James Bond and <em>Indiana Jones.</em> But there is also a similarity to Steven Spielberg&#8217;s CG adaptation of <em>Tintin</em>, which pushed the boundaries for 3D-animated action. What are the advantages of 3D-CG for these kind of big action sequences?</strong></p>\n<p>What I did with <em>Lupin</em> was not something that I could normally do in Japan in live action, but it&#8217;s not like I was like trying to do different things just because this is CG. I was really thinking about what I wanted to do with the film if I were to work on <em>Lupin</em>. So, you know, let&#8217;s say I was born in America, and I was able to work on this movie [in Hollywood]. I would use the same concept of what I would be doing: I would create the set, I would create the setting, I would take the characters around the world. So I wasn&#8217;t necessarily thinking of pushing the borders because I have the CG project on my hands, because I think when you try to be so flashy and acrobatic, the movie just loses its appeal and the audience won&#8217;t really like it. I filmed it that normally like I would if I were to do a Hollywood film.</p>\n<p><strong>For those unfamiliar with <em>Lupin III</em>, what would you like to say to them to encourage them to see your film?</strong></p>\n<p>Okay, let&#8217;s see, that&#8217;s a pretty hard question. Even though they&#8217;re thieves, that they&#8217;re really fun, and they do a lot of good. You know, usually thieves are seen as bad guys but then they&#8217;re actually very human, and you know this movie is about how a little girl who has no freedom. But these thieves help her out. I think that&#8217;s what I&#8217;d like to tell them.</p>\n<p><em>This interview was conducted through a translator.

But he balances those types of films out with the occasional turn in a genuinely good movie – like the recent <em>Uncut Gems</em>, or in <strong>Paul Thomas Anderson</strong>&#8216;s fantastic <strong><em>Punch-Drunk Love</em></strong>. Anderson&#8217;s film is the gold standard for &#8220;good Adam Sandler performances,&#8221; but according to the Sandman himself, he was very nervous about taking the role. In a recent interview, Sandler revealed that after watching Anderson&#8217;s <em>Magnolia</em>, he grew worried that he was going to &#8220;ruin&#8221; <em>Punch-Drunk Love</em>.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-641515\"></span></p>\n<p>Adam Sandler is not exactly known for his dramatic work, but in 2002 he earned some of the best reviews of his entire career when he appeared in Paul Thomas Anderson&#8217;s <em>Punch-Drunk Love</em>. To be clear, <em>Punch-Drunk Love</em> is a comedy – but it&#8217;s a dark comedy, and not at all like the type of comedies Sandler usually makes. It was a somewhat risky idea, but it paid off in the end.</p>\n<p>However, it took some convincing. During a recent interview on the <a href=\"https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/smartless/adam-sandler-kVGBwfMdbUn/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em><strong>SmartLess</strong></em></a> podcast (via <a href=\"https://collider.com/adam-sandler-punch-drunk-love-explained/\">Collider</a>), Sandler recounted how he ended up in the film. <strong>Tom Cruise</strong> plays a supporting role in this story, as Cruise – having just worked with Anderson on <em>Magnolia</em> – is the one who first told Sandler that Anderson wanted to make a movie with him. As Sandler tells it, he met Cruise when Cruise&#8217;s then-wife Nicole Kidman was hosting <em>Saturday Night Live</em>. Later, Cruise called Sandler up and, as Sandler tells it, said: &#8220;I&#8217;m doing a movie with my friend Paul, and he’s interested in doing a movie with you. Can I put him on the phone?&#8221;</p>\n<p>Paul was, of course, Paul Thomas Anderson. &#8220;Paul was very nice, and he says, &#8216;Hey, I loved <em><strong>Billy Madison</strong></em>,'&#8221; Sandler said. &#8220;And I was like, &#8216;Okay, thanks,&#8217; but I didn’t know who he was.&#8221; At that point, Anderson asked if it was okay if he wrote a movie for Sandler. Sandler eventually agreed. However, he was still unfamiliar with Anderson&#8217;s work. And then <em>Magnolia</em> came out. Here&#8217;s what happened next, according to Sandler:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;But then, honest to God, it was like 11 in the morning, and I had nothing to do, and <em>Magnolia</em> just came out, and I said, &#8216;I think this is that kid&#8217;s movie. I’m going to go see that.&#8217; It was sold out, and I was in the front row, and I was looking up at it, and I was fucking terrified, and I was going, ‘Oh this guy is fucking better than me. I don&#8217;t want to be in this. I&#8217;m going to ruin his movie! Holy shit!'&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Sandler immediately called up Anderson and told him he couldn&#8217;t do the movie, but Anderson drove over to Sandler&#8217;s house and walked him through the script, and won Sandler over. &#8220;I always said I could do this, but this was too much. But he talked me through it, and he made me comfortable,&#8221; said the Sandman. And the rest is history.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/punch-drunk-love/\">Adam Sandler Was Worried He Would &#8220;Ruin&#8221; &#8216;Punch-Drunk Love&#8217;</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=iyRba_6S0kA:a843EXTCBC0:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=iyRba_6S0kA:a843EXTCBC0:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=iyRba_6S0kA:a843EXTCBC0:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=iyRba_6S0kA:a843EXTCBC0:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=iyRba_6S0kA:a843EXTCBC0:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=iyRba_6S0kA:a843EXTCBC0:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/iyRba_6S0kA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 16 Oct 2020 21:30:19 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/punch-drunk-love-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"684924df7ccb3077a7f9a53f45a96ef0","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn43@2020_2/2020/10/17/02-30-02-537_a0964c5c37746379.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":28319,"destBytes":13556,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/punch-drunk-love-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn43@2020_2/2020/10/17/02-30-02-537_a0964c5c37746379.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn16@2020_2/2020/10/17/02-30-18-778_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=iyRba_6S0kA:a843EXTCBC0:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn100@2020_6/2020/10/17/02-30-18-625_9ed80568f5af624f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn35@2020_1/2020/10/17/02-30-19-618_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=iyRba_6S0kA:a843EXTCBC0:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn31@2020_1/2020/10/17/02-30-18-692_a182cad75910466b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/iyRba_6S0kA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn48@2020_5/2020/10/17/02-30-18-684_5a8c7030cc16e421.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602901784083},{"createdTime":"2020-10-17 10:29:44","updatedTime":"2020-10-17 10:29:44","title":"‘Star Trek: Discovery’ Season 4 Happening at CBS All Access, Filming Starts Next Month","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=641712","description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/star-trek-discovery-season-4.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-641719\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/star-trek-discovery-season-4-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"star trek discovery season 4\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/star-trek-discovery-season-4-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/star-trek-discovery-season-4-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/star-trek-discovery-season-4-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/star-trek-discovery-season-4.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p>CBS All Access, which should probably change its name to the <em>Star Trek </em>Channel at this point, just went ahead and ordered <strong><em>Star Trek: Discovery </em></strong>season 4.

While the crew must work together to unravel their meaning and origin, Michael Burnham is forced to face her past with the return of her estranged brother, Spock.&#8221; That second season ended with the <i>Discovery</i> crew traveling to the future, which opens up all sorts of possibilities for this latest season, and any season that comes after it.</p>\n<p><strong>Sonequa Martin-Green</strong> stars as Michael Burnham, a female science specialist on the Discovery, leading a cast that includes <strong>Doug Jones</strong>, <strong>Shazad Latif</strong>, <strong>Anthony Rapp</strong>, <strong>Mary Wiseman</strong>, and <strong>Wilson Cruz</strong>. CBS All Access is all-in on <em>Star Trek,</em> producing <em>Discovery</em> along with titles like <em>Star Trek: Lower Decks</em>, <em>Star Trek: Picard</em>, <em>Star Trek: Short Treks</em> as well as upcoming titles like <em>Star Trek: Prodigy</em>, <em>Star Trek: Strange New Worlds</em>, and a still-untitled series focused on Starfleet&#8217;s Section 31 division, with Michelle Yeoh reprising her role from <em>Discovery</em>. CBS All Access has plenty of non-<em>Trek</em> titles, too – but the <em>Trek</em> stuff is the only thing that seems to generate buzz.

Taylor-Joy gushed about Theron&#8217;s indelible take on the role, and teased that she will try to differentiate herself with her starring part in <em>Furiosa</em>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I fell in love with Furiosa because of the way Charlize presented her. She did such an incredible job. It was so beautiful. I can’t even think about trying to step into her shoes. It has to be something different because it just can’t be done. [&#8230;] I’ve already started dreaming about [Furiosa] and she’s coming in very strong. I’m so committed to working as hard as possible as I can. I always said that I wanted a role that I would have to give everything to, it wouldn’t just be my mind but my body, what I’m doing with myself when I’m not on set. I’m so excited for that and to push myself past the limits of what my brain thought was possible.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Theron had previously <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/furiosa-movie/\">admitted</a> that it was &#8220;a little heartbreaking&#8221; for her to not reprise the role of Furiosa again, but respected and trusted Miller&#8217;s decision. &#8220;I really love that character [Furiosa], and I’m so grateful that I had a small part in creating her,&#8221; Theron said. &#8220;She will forever be someone I think of and reflect on fondly. Obviously, I would love to see that story continue, and if he feels like he has to go about it this way, then I trust him in that manner.&#8221;</p>\n<p>But Taylor-Joy, who reminisced about seeing <i>Mad Max: Fury Road</i> for the first time in Belfast, where she is currently filming the upcoming film <em>The Northman</em>, directed by <em>The Witch</em> director Robert Eggers, is determined to do right by both Theron and Miller.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I walked past the cinema where I first was amazed by this incredible mind of George Miller,&#8221; said Taylor-Joy. &#8220;It’s difficult to put into words. I feel so humbled and grateful. I think the first thing I thought was ‘I am so excited to work so hard.’ The level of commitment that has been shown by those who came before me, I endeavor to match that. That makes me really excited. I have so much respect for the originators of this crazy world and this collection of characters. I am excited to work really hard.&#8221;</p>\n<p><em>Furiosa </em>is also set to star<strong> Chris Hemsworth</strong> and <strong>Yahya Abdul-Mateen II</strong>. The timeline of the film’s production isn’t known yet, but THR adds that the project is in &#8220;advance development.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/anya-taylor-joy-furiosa/\">Anya Taylor-Joy&#8217;s Furiosa Will Be &#8220;Different&#8221; From Charlize Theron&#8217;s Take</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=FrlF8fRiins:KaJFQrtiYZM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=FrlF8fRiins:KaJFQrtiYZM:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=FrlF8fRiins:KaJFQrtiYZM:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=FrlF8fRiins:KaJFQrtiYZM:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=FrlF8fRiins:KaJFQrtiYZM:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=FrlF8fRiins:KaJFQrtiYZM:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/FrlF8fRiins\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 16 Oct 2020 19:30:19 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Furiosa-prequel-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"e210f3a1376a2dacd0b51850c760584a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn64@2020_5/2020/10/17/02-29-44-437_dce23f9f48d13142.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":20277,"destBytes":8578,"author":"Hoai-Tran Bui","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Furiosa-prequel-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn64@2020_5/2020/10/17/02-29-44-437_dce23f9f48d13142.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn16@2020_2/2020/10/17/02-30-18-778_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=FrlF8fRiins:KaJFQrtiYZM:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn7@2020_5/2020/10/17/02-30-18-736_7d530521e505073d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn35@2020_1/2020/10/17/02-30-19-618_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=FrlF8fRiins:KaJFQrtiYZM:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn31@2020_2/2020/10/17/02-30-19-624_d80efb5723f3e906.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/FrlF8fRiins":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn64@2020_5/2020/10/17/02-30-18-593_65e171c641924b56.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602901784083},{"createdTime":"2020-10-17 10:29:44","updatedTime":"2020-10-17 10:29:44","title":"‘Love and Monsters’ Trailer: Dylan O’Brien Faces Terrifying Creatures in the Sci-Fi Teen RomCom Out Today","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=641638","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-641651 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/loveandmonsters-dylanobrien-crossbow-scared-700x310.jpg\" alt=\"Final Love and Monsters Trailer\" width=\"700\" height=\"310\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/loveandmonsters-dylanobrien-crossbow-scared-700x310.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/loveandmonsters-dylanobrien-crossbow-scared-360x159.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/loveandmonsters-dylanobrien-crossbow-scared-768x340.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/loveandmonsters-dylanobrien-crossbow-scared.jpg 1005w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>There are plenty of movies that aren&#8217;t getting released in theaters this year that audiences are hungry to sink their teeth into. Many of them have been moved to 2021, but this weekend brings the release of a movie that deserves the big screen treatment that has unfortunately been relegated to a small screen debut on premium VOD.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Love and Monsters</em></strong> takes place seven years after a monster apocalypse was unleashed on Earth. After spending years in a bunker with other survivors, a young guy named Joel (<strong>Dylan O&#8217;Brien</strong>) is sick of waiting for things to change, and he decides to head to the surface to reunite with his high school sweetheart Amy (<strong>Jessica Henwick</strong>), who is in another bunker 80 miles away. There&#8217;s just one problem: Joel is far from skilled at surviving, and he has a tendency to freeze whenever a giant monster comes around. See for yourself in the new <em>Love and Monsters</em> trailer below.<span id=\"more-641638\"></span></p>\n<h2>Love and Monsters Trailer</h2>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vGl9Dkl2Onc?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>After an asteroid headed for Earth was blasted out of the sky by military missiles, the chemical compounds from the explosion fell down to the planet and mutated some of Earth&#8217;s creatures into huge monsters that have killed 95% of the human population. We&#8217;re talking about massive human-eating ants, sharp-teethed lamprey-like worms, and huge, slimy frogs, just to name a few.</p>\n<p><em>Love and Monsters</em> is surprisingly great, despite being a bit formulaic. It&#8217;s like <em>Zombieland</em> meets<em> A Quiet Place</em>, but it&#8217;s not trying too hard to be funny, and there&#8217;s an impressive array of gnarly monsters to keep you on the edge of your seat. Dylan O&#8217;Brien helps keep things grounded emotionally, but he also brings a lot of levity to the situation. Plus, there&#8217;s <strong>Michael Rooker</strong> and <strong>Ariana Greenblatt</strong> as survivors that Joel encounters out in the world, and they make for great companions. Oh, and did I mention that there&#8217;s a very good dog to fall in love with too?</p>\n<p>There are outstanding setpieces in <em>Love and Monsters</em> that make this a low-key blockbuster deserving of the big screen. The production design itself is breathtaking, creating a world that I would love to see explored in a sequel or even some kind of companion TV series. I hope audiences find this movie on VOD, because it has the potential to be a hit.</p>\n<p><em>Love and Monsters</em> is directed by <strong>Michael Matthews</strong> with a script by <strong>Brian Duffield</strong> and <strong>Matthew Robinson</strong>.</p>\n<blockquote><p><span class=\"style-scope yt-formatted-string\" dir=\"auto\">After monsters take over the world, Joel (Dylan O’Brien) and the rest of humanity are forced to live underground. Believing he’s lost everyone he has ever loved, Joel finds his high school sweetheart Aimee (Jessica Henwick) living just 80 miles away. Facing unknown dangers that stand in his way, Joel must discover his inner hero as he makes the impossible journey across a monster-infested land to be with the girl of his dreams.

There&#8217;s a collection of episodes following the family taking various trips, another collection featuring all of their sports-related antics, and even a collection of episodes that contain the frequently surprising prescient predictions that the show somehow made, such as Disney buying 20th Century Fox and Donald Trump becoming president. However, the one that was frustratingly missing was a collection of all the Halloween-themed <strong>Treehouse of Horror</strong> episodes. Thankfully, that has changed this month.<span id=\"more-641629\"></span></p>\n<p>Disney+ has announced that<em> The Simpsons</em> Treehouse of Horror collection is now live in their streaming library, including all 30 Treehouse of Horror episodes from over the years. It&#8217;s all part of their their new Simpsons Forever marketing push that they&#8217;re using to remind you that there&#8217;s nearly 300 hours of <em>The Simpsons</em> available on Disney+.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/64hyVkPvEOQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>Now you might be asking yourself, if all 31 seasons of<em> The Simpsons</em> are now available on Disney+, then why are there only 30 episodes of the Treehouse of Horror? That&#8217;s because the Halloween tradition didn&#8217;t begin until the show&#8217;s second season, and they&#8217;ve done it every year since then. Honestly, if there&#8217;s ever a second big screen venture for <em>The Simpsons</em>, I wish they would do something tied to Treehouse of Horror. That would be a lot of fun.</p>\n<p>Anyway, go ahead and get into the Halloween spirit with the <em>The Simpsons</em> Treehouse of Horror collection on Disney+ right now. And if you haven&#8217;t already, make sure you select the option that displays the older episodes in the <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-simpsons-aspect-ratio-problem-fixed-may-28/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">original 4:3 aspect ratio</a> instead of the remastered 16:9 aspect ratio. Otherwise you might lose some visual gags.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-simpsons-treehouse-of-horror-collection/\">All &#8216;The Simpsons&#8217; Treehouse of Horror Episodes Are Now Available in One Collection on Disney+</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=DPe83uEnAiM:t2ialSUeAyk:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=DPe83uEnAiM:t2ialSUeAyk:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=DPe83uEnAiM:t2ialSUeAyk:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=DPe83uEnAiM:t2ialSUeAyk:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=DPe83uEnAiM:t2ialSUeAyk:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=DPe83uEnAiM:t2ialSUeAyk:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/DPe83uEnAiM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 16 Oct 2020 17:30:35 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/simpsons-family-halloweencostumes-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"ca322c1c177a468aae1068f6ed5b390a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn8@2020_3/2020/10/17/02-29-44-466_d93496c7ba0af36d.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":57637,"destBytes":45146,"author":"Ethan Anderton","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/simpsons-family-halloweencostumes-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn8@2020_3/2020/10/17/02-29-44-466_d93496c7ba0af36d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn16@2020_2/2020/10/17/02-30-18-778_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=DPe83uEnAiM:t2ialSUeAyk:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn1@2020_6/2020/10/17/02-30-18-655_ea4699f7ff843871.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn35@2020_1/2020/10/17/02-30-19-618_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=DPe83uEnAiM:t2ialSUeAyk:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn28@2020_5/2020/10/17/02-30-18-693_4ad60959138e1d63.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/DPe83uEnAiM":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn47@2020_5/2020/10/17/02-30-19-377_e088eb403bae9ea0.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602901784087},{"createdTime":"2020-10-17 10:29:44","updatedTime":"2020-10-17 10:29:44","title":"‘Calico Joe’, John Grisham’s Baseball Novel, Being Turned Into a Movie By George Clooney (and Bob Dylan)","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=641705","description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/calico-joe-movie.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-641709\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/calico-joe-movie-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"calico joe movie\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/calico-joe-movie-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/calico-joe-movie-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/calico-joe-movie-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/calico-joe-movie.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Stop me if you heard this one: <strong>Geroge Clooney</strong>, <strong>Jon Grisham</strong>, and <strong>Bob Dylan</strong> get together and say, &#8220;Let&#8217;s make a movie!&#8221; No, this isn&#8217;t the set-up of a joke. Instead, it&#8217;s news about a new movie. George Clooney is considering directing <strong><em>Calico Joe</em></strong>, a film adapted from the John Grisham novel of the same name. And Bob Dylan&#8217;s Grey Water Park Productions is set to produce. While Grisham is primarily known for his legal thrillers, <em>Calico Joe</em> is about a baseball player in the 1970s who ends up in a coma for three decades after being struck by a pitch.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-641705\"></span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://variety.com/2020/film/news/george-clooney-john-grisham-calico-joe-bob-dylan-1234806807/\">Variety</a> is reporting the <em>Calico Joe</em> movie news, stating that George Clooney and producing/writing partner <strong>Grant Heslov</strong> are developing the project with Clooney possibly directing as well. And, perhaps most surprising of all, Bob Dylan is also involved in the project, via his Grey Water Park Productions. Here&#8217;s the synopsis of Grisham&#8217;s book:</p>\n<blockquote><p>It’s the summer of 1973, and Joe Castle is the boy wonder of baseball, the greatest rookie anyone has ever seen. The kid from Calico Rock, Arkansas, dazzles Chicago Cubs fans as he hits home run after home run, politely tipping his hat to the crowd as he shatters all rookie records. Calico Joe quickly becomes the idol of every baseball fan in America, including Paul Tracey, the young son of a hard-partying and hard-throwing New York Mets pitcher. On the day that Warren Tracey finally faces Calico Joe, Paul is in the stands, rooting for his idol but also for his dad. Then Warren throws a fastball that will change their lives forever.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The book is partially inspired by 1920s baseball player Ray Chapman, who is the only Major League Baseball player to die from an injury received during a game. Chapman was struck in the head by a pitch and died 12 hours later. At the time, ballgames would usually only stick with one ball, no matter how damaged or dirty it got. This often made the ball hard to see.

With the fall/winter movie season  effectively out for the count after major studios pushed back their big releases to 2021 and state governments keeping major markets like Los Angeles and New York closed, movie exhibitors are struggling to stay afloat. Studios like Universal have reached a compromise with AMC Theaters by striking a VOD window release, but is that enough to keep theater chains from sinking?</p>\n<p>Probably not. For theaters to truly survive, the movie industry may need to go back to the Classic Hollywood model of studios owning stakes in exhibitors. But major studios like Warner Bros. and Universal don&#8217;t have any plans to buy out movie theaters any time soon.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-641609\"></span></p>\n<p>In a Deadline report, Universal Filmed Entertainment Group chair Donna Langley and Warner Bros. CEO and chair Ann Sarnoff both laughed at the idea of their studios buying out movie theaters.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have no plans to do that currently,&#8221; Langley said at a Milken Institute Global Conference virtual panel with Sarnoff and CBS CEO George Cheeks on COVID-19&#8217;s impact on Hollywood. &#8220;We have no plans either,&#8221; Sarnoff added, with a chuckle. Sarnoff added that they&#8217;re &#8220;rooting for&#8221; exhibitors, but despite both companies&#8217; commitment to theatrical releases, expressed no concrete plans to aid theaters:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I’m kind of an armchair sociologist and I believe people want to have communal experiences and especially with certain genres. We’re big fans of the exhibitors. They’ve been good partners of ours for many decades. We’re rooting for them. I know it’s tough sledding right now. I’m hoping they come out on the other side, probably even stronger.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>From the 1920s to 1940s, it was common for studios to have an ownership stake in exhibition chains — spurred on by the 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic which shuttered theaters across the nation. It was common practice for studios to control theaters until the 1948 Paramount decree broke up the monopolies. But history repeats itself yet again — with another pandemic shuttering theaters across the country, but this time, no studios are willing to step in to buy them out even with the 1948 Paramount decree now <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2020/08/paramount-consent-decrees-exhibition-shutdown-coronavirus-windows-universal-amc-1203007920/\">abolished</a>.</p>\n<p>Movie theater chains are on the brink, AMC teetering on the <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/amc-theatres-out-of-money-bb-theatres-may-go-bankrupt/\">precipice of bankruptcy for years</a>, while Regal Cinemas&#8217; parent company reported a <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/tag/regal-cinemas/\">$1.6 billion loss</a> in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. Major studios have turned to streaming and VOD to make back a profit, but theaters are left without an out. Deadline reports that domestic box office is on pace to plummet more than 80% in the U.S. All this while filmmakers have <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/hollywood-filmmakers-ask-congress-to-save-movie-theaters/\">banded together to plea</a> for the survival of cinemas, while chains wait fruitlessly for a bailout plan from Congress.</p>\n<p>Langley said Universal remains committed to theaters, citing the studio&#8217;s historic deal with AMC‚ which enables titles to leave theaters after a 17-day window — as proof. The Universal chair also mentioned upcoming theatrical release <em>The Croods: A New Age</em>, while Sarnoff cited spring 2021 theatrical release <em>In the Heights</em>. But Langley said there&#8217;s &#8220;no line of sight&#8221; on how long the pandemic will go on. And there&#8217;s no telling whether theaters will emerge from the pandemic either.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/movie-theater-buyouts-hollywood-studios/\">Major Hollywood Studios Won&#8217;t Be Buying Out Movie Theaters Any Time Soon</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=FOdsfAo_kfk:qD2zROah62I:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=FOdsfAo_kfk:qD2zROah62I:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=FOdsfAo_kfk:qD2zROah62I:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=FOdsfAo_kfk:qD2zROah62I:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=FOdsfAo_kfk:qD2zROah62I:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=FOdsfAo_kfk:qD2zROah62I:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/FOdsfAo_kfk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 16 Oct 2020 18:30:50 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/AMC-Social-Distancing-Protocols-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"0301de0537b7c2219c1647bc414eb108","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn15@2020_5/2020/10/17/02-30-00-875_8b75daf71475b314.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":54132,"destBytes":40316,"author":"Hoai-Tran Bui","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/AMC-Social-Distancing-Protocols-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn15@2020_5/2020/10/17/02-30-00-875_8b75daf71475b314.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn16@2020_2/2020/10/17/02-30-18-778_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=FOdsfAo_kfk:qD2zROah62I:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn91@2020_5/2020/10/17/02-30-19-494_b010116af697906c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn35@2020_1/2020/10/17/02-30-19-618_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=FOdsfAo_kfk:qD2zROah62I:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn40@2020_1/2020/10/17/02-30-19-802_bd27613d10d65c0e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/FOdsfAo_kfk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn35@2020_2/2020/10/17/02-30-18-569_d5c2f4b258824b59.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602901784083}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-10-17 10:29:44","updatedTime":"2020-10-17 10:29:44","feedId":21,"fetchDate":"Sat, 17 Oct 2020 02:29:44 +0000","fetchMs":173,"handleMs":581,"totalMs":37938,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":20,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"f6db38fc16ee9e62fc92cadc75f25f6b","hostName":"us-005*","requestId":"76caf5777b6d483e9d122e7e8170ddb1_21","contentType":"text/xml; charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":888022,"bgimgsTotal":18,"bgimgsGithubTotal":18,"articlesImgsTotal":86,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":86,"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx14":3,"myreaderx8":3,"myreaderx7":3,"myreaderx15":3,"myreaderx16":3,"myreaderx6":3,"myreaderx32":4,"myreaderx10":3,"myreaderx4":2,"myreaderx33":3,"myreaderx11":3,"myreaderx3":3,"myreaderx12":3,"myreaderx2":3,"myreaderx1":3,"myreaderx13":3,"myreaderx30":1,"myreaderx31":3,"myreaderx18":3,"myreaderx19":3,"myreaderx":2,"myreaderx25":3,"myreaderx27":3,"myreaderx21":4,"myreaderx22":3,"myreaderx23":3,"myreaderx24":4,"myreaderx5oss":4,"myreaderx29":2},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-05-30 17:21:38","updatedTime":"2020-09-01 09:23:23","id":21,"name":"/Film","url":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/slashfilm","subscriber":null,"website":null,"icon":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/cropped-ZZ46A5EC75-32x32.jpg","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx64/cdn36@2020_2/2020/09/01/01-23-09-121_cba84478f5ca776d.jpg","description":"Movie News and Reviews This feed is for non commercial use.
