I <a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/software-architecture/sa-ny/public/schedule/detail/79994\">presented this work at O’Reilly’s Software Architecture conference</a> in New York at the beginning of 2020.</p><p><strong>What was your first job?<br></strong>I worked as a research assistant in the Centre for Research &#38; Technology — Hellas (CERTH) in Greece on a European-funded project for viral news detection.

As you recounted your latest adventures, I would learn about you, but in no way would that be a violation of your privacy.</p><p>However, if you happened to catch me listening in through the window as you depicted the same events to someone else, I would be a creep breaching your privacy and would deserve my comeuppance at the hands of your just fury.</p><p>Eavesdropping is not the only privacy misdeed, however. I could listen to you in confidence and blab to your colleagues. I could discreetly record our conversation, keeping evidence for unspecified future purposes. I could broadcast the more humiliating of your misfortunes in a blog post.</p><p>There are numerous ways one might betray someone’s privacy, but they are evident in most everyday situations. It’s unlikely that the examples above made you feel compelled to locate your nearest ethicist and pepper them with questions. The line between acceptable in-person interactions and violations of privacy is clear.</p><p>Why, then, is digital privacy such a contentious topic? Why is The Times making substantial changes to how we handle personal data? But first — what even <em>is</em> privacy?</p><h3>What even <em>is</em> privacy?</h3><p>The privacy implications of a chat over wine are straightforward. But step into the digital realm and privacy looks like the hangover from a kindergartener play date. The ground is strewn with <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/04/10/opinion/internet-privacy-terms.html\">cookies</a> and their entourage of layperson metaphors, from <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/06/12/opinion/facebook-google-privacy-policies.html\">privacy policies</a>, to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/12/10/business/location-data-privacy-apps.html\">data</a> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/12/19/opinion/location-tracking-cell-phone.html\">brokers</a> and an endless stream of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/02/opinion/internet-facebook-google-consent.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FPrivacy&#38;action=click&#38;contentCollection=timestopics&#38;region=stream&#38;module=stream_unit&#38;version=latest&#38;contentPlacement=7&#38;pgtype=collection\">consent dialogs</a>. And, in the end, the learned helplessness of knowing you have lost all control over who knows what about you.</p><p>Privacy should not be confused with the clutter surrounding it, no more than it should be confused with <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/23/opinion/privacy-tech-companies.html\">secrecy</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/10/opinion/sunday/privacy-capitalism.html\">having a private room</a> or <a href=\"https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~shmat/courses/cs5436/warren-brandeis.pdf\">the right to be left alone</a>.</p><p>Privacy is “<a href=\"https://www.bitbybitbook.com/en/1st-ed/ethics/dilemmas/privacy/\">a right to appropriate flows of information</a>,” according to <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/books/10948192/9780804752374\">Helen Nissenbaum</a>, a professor of Information Science at Cornell Tech. Any given context in which personal information flows from a sender to a recipient has ethical norms that govern whether or not that flow is appropriate. Respect for these norms is what we collectively call “privacy.” These norms are contextual because what can appropriately be observed or shared about someone is different if it happens at home or at work; at a doctor’s office or at a party; in public or one-on-one.</p><p>Privacy contexts can be described with their actors (subject, sender, recipient), attributes (what is being shared) and transmission principles (constraints on the flow of information).</p><p>Returning to our chat over a glass of wine, if I were to blab to your co-workers the following day, the actors and attributes would remain the same, but I would be betraying the trust of an open-hearted discussion with a friend. This betrayal is a violation of privacy.</p><h3>Why is The Times interested in privacy?</h3><p>Equating a violation of privacy to a betrayal is not arbitrary: privacy is about trust. And at The Times, <a href=\"https://www.nytco.com/company/mission-and-values/\">the trust of our readers is essential</a>. As our publisher, A. G. Sulzberger, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/10/opinion/sulzberger-new-york-times-privacy.html\">wrote last year</a>, we have been concerned about our contribution to the current muddle of online privacy.</p><p>As a group, news organizations have garnered a dismal reputation in terms of privacy. In an investigation of third-party tracking on German news sites, The Global Editors Network concluded, “<a href=\"http://newsreadsus.okfn.de/\">we used to read the newspaper, now the news reads us</a>.” Nieman Journalism Lab reported on a study showing that “<a href=\"https://www.niemanlab.org/2018/05/european-news-sites-are-among-the-worst-offenders-when-it-comes-to-third-party-cookies-and-content/\">European news sites are among the worst offenders when it comes to third-party cookies and content.</a>” That’s Europe, where the relatively comprehensive General Data Protection Regulation (G.D.P.R.) privacy regulation should be keeping the worst privacy infractions at bay.</p><p>Looking at the United States, researchers Tim Libert and Reuben Binns <a href=\"https://timlibert.me/pdf/LIBERT_BINNS-2019-GOOD_NEWS.pdf\">reported</a> that news websites rely heavily on third-party trackers. This has “fostered an environment of pervasive surveillance,” and the “widespread adoption of opaque and poorly disclosed tracking practices.” Their research found that news sites rely on third-party tracking more than non-news sites.</p><p>Why is the state of online privacy in news media so grim? Most publishers rely on one of two business models: subscriptions and advertising. Some publishers, like The Times, rely on both.</p><p>Subscription models depend on finding new subscribers through marketing tactics, many of which <a href=\"https://brave.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Behavioural-advertising-and-personal-data.pdf\">depend on third-party data collection</a>.</p><p>Advertising models track as much of each user’s digital presence as possible to enrich the personal profiles maintained by third-party companies. Then, for a majority of ads that a user sees, that personal data is broadcasted to advertising intermediaries so that companies can bid on showing ads targeted to that user.</p><h3>What The Times is doing about it</h3><p>This digital ecosystem has a long way to go before it respects users’ privacy. Until then, The Times has been fostering better privacy standards for the parts we can control.</p><p>We have completely rewritten our <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/privacy/privacy-policy\">Privacy Policy</a> with legibility in mind (now rated at a 7-year-old readability level), and we added a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/privacy/\">Frequently Asked Questions</a> section. Over the past two years, we have made our internal data practices significantly more mindful of our readers’ privacy.</p><p><strong>Improved privacy in marketing<br></strong>Our marketing goal is to attract new subscribers, which we accomplish through a variety of tactics. Not all of these tactics require us to share data about our readers with other companies, but some do. And those tracking companies typically have independent control over the data they collect, which they can then repackage for other purposes. These are <em>data controllers</em>.</p><p>As of April 2019, we removed all third-party data controllers from our homepage, section fronts and articles. We limited them to marketing-related parts of the site, such as subscription offer pages. This reduced the amount of data we shared with third-party data controllers by over 90 percent. We are working on ways to improve this number, but for the time being our marketing goals still rely on these tactics.</p><p>Additionally, we have been developing means to advertise to potential subscribers without sharing data. <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-media-trends-a189a865-c7ed-4a0a-86ca-7182692eb74f.html?chunk=3#story3\">One example is TAFI</a>, <a href=\"https://digiday.com/media/new-york-times-mines-data-pick-articles-promote-facebook-twitter/\">a tool used to advertise our content</a> on social media. We are also following the development of privacy-preserving technologies that support <a href=\"https://privacycg.github.io/private-click-measurement/\">marketing purposes</a>.</p><p><strong>Towards better privacy in advertising<br></strong>Advertising is a set of practices used to support other companies that promote products or services on a platform. There are many ways in which advertising can be carried out: some as simple as handing out flyers in the neighborhood and some more complex. To say that digital advertising sits at the more complex end of this spectrum severely undersells just how <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3465780\">intricate and opaque it is</a>, particularly in how it distributes and exploits personal data.</p><p>Virtually all online advertising operates through third-party software that is included in sites or apps. What happens through this software in advertising can be entirely legitimate — fraud prevention is one example. But the technology used for defensible purposes is the same as that used for pervasive surveillance, which makes separating user-friendly options from user-hostile ones challenging.</p><p>This has not stopped The Times from making progress.</p><p>Across our digital properties in Europe, as well as in our mobile apps worldwide, we have removed open-market programmatic advertising, which broadcasts personal data to dozens of third parties in a way that publishers have very little control over.</p><p>We are decreasing our reliance on third parties by developing our own capabilities to serve ads that are not based on tracking readers across their entire connected lives. To make ads effective without knowing anything about who they are being presented to, we have built <a href=\"https://open.nytimes.com/how-does-this-article-make-you-feel-4684e5e9c47?source=collection_category---4------7-----------------------\">improved contextual targeting capabilities</a>.</p><p>Our research at The Times shows that readers are broadly comfortable with us, the first party, seeing some data about them. But they are overwhelmingly unhappy with data being shared with third parties that can use the data for entirely different purposes. With this in mind, <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/new-york-times-advertising-792b3cd6-4bdb-47c3-9817-36601211a79d.html?utm_source=newsletter&#38;utm_medium=email&#38;utm_campaign=newsletter_axiosmediatrends&#38;stream=top\">we are phasing out third-party data in ad targeting</a>.</p><p>Our hope is to push this even further. In pursuit of that goal, we have been reaching out to others in the industry to help design a better advertising ecosystem. Eventually, we want to provide accountability for every data processing step involved in serving ads to readers.</p><h3>Building a Better Model</h3><p>In response to surveillance, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/03/28/mass-surveillance-silences-minority-opinions-according-to-study/\">people have been seen to silence their minority opinions</a> and <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2412564\">to restrict what they search for online</a>. At The Times, we believe in a world of fearless and unfettered curiosity. We wish to develop positive norms of data privacy so that our digital society can not just exist, but flourish.</p><p>Privacy is contextual, but it can be difficult to know what is appropriate in digital contexts. While it is easy to notice that the doctor’s does not have the same vibe as your regular dive bar, our digital experience involves staring at shiny slabs of plastic that all look the same. You can catch someone spying through your window, but most people cannot see the code surveilling them.</p><p>In the same way that we don’t need to think hard about privacy in everyday life, The Times is helping build norms for the internet <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2655719\">to make it a context that users can trust</a>.</p><p>Such work was <a href=\"https://bobgellman.com/rg-docs/rg-FIPshistory.pdf\">started fifty years ago</a> (PDF) when the United States formed a <a href=\"https://aspe.hhs.gov/report/records-computers-and-rights-citizens\">committee</a> that established the initial Fair Information Practices to address “concern about the effects of computerized personal data systems.”</p><p>The committee’s principles, often summarized more than is reasonable as transparency and control, are still in use today. The focus on transparency and control, however, yields insufficient guidance for today’s data economy. The volume of personal data processed in the 1970s was relatively low. It was reasonable to expect users to review a handful of privacy policies and to convey their preferences by controlling the finer details of what data was collected about them. Given the ubiquity of today’s data collection, that is no longer a defensible position.</p><p>Returning to the example of my earlier eavesdropping: transparency is the claim that you can always check who is spying through your window, and control is the contention that you can close the curtains in every room you visit. That works if you have two conversations a year, but quickly falls apart if you socialize more regularly. It is unfair for a company to benefit from personal data while making its users do the labor to ensure that their data is processed appropriately.</p><p>At The Times, we feel it is essential to modernize the guiding principles for privacy and we are <a href=\"https://privacycg.github.io/\">participating in discussions</a> to do so. Data processing has changed radically since the 1970s, but so has our understanding of privacy and our awareness of its importance to human well-being.</p><p>We see privacy not as a constraint on our work but as an opportunity to bring about the next digital transformation. We are adamant that respecting our readers’ privacy is our responsibility and that the work to evolve in that direction is ours to shoulder.</p><p>We will continue to build atop the changes we have already made, and are committed to working with you and with other organizations to define privacy for the digital era.</p><p><em>Robin Berjon leads Data Governance at The New York Times.

As an engineering manager, I coach and help engineers so that there are minimal obstacles for them to get to their goals, and I support any decision making that needs to be done.</p><p><strong>How long have you been at The Times?<br></strong>Shy of 8 months.</p><p><strong>Most Times employees are working remotely right now. Where are you working from these days?<br></strong>When the news broke that many non-essential businesses were being shut and that The Times was moving to remote work, my fiancé and I escaped to Connecticut. I’m very lucky to have a larger space to work from. I’ve converted the dining room table to my office.</p><p><strong>How do you start your day?<br></strong>Honestly, it’s been tough to wake up early because I know it doesn’t take a long time for me to “commute to work.” I set my alarm clock to 7 a.m., but usually end up rolling out of bed at 8:30 a.m. I then, finally freshen up, go to my “office,” turn on “The Daily,” make a cup of tea and breakfast, and I check my Trello Board, emails, Slack and calendar to figure out what I want to accomplish in the day and to catch up on anything I missed the day before. On a good day, I’ll actually wake up at 7 a.m. to go work out.</p><p><strong>What is something you’ve worked on recently?<br></strong>Currently, I’ve been taking up knitting, baking and cooking. I’m working on a baby blanket, and last weekend I made some dumplings from scratch (skin and all!).</p><p><strong>Tell us about a project you’ve worked on at The Times that you’re especially proud of.<br></strong>A couple weeks ago, we rolled out the PayPal smart button with the use of the new Braintree SDK.

I started on July 11, 2016.</p><p><strong>Most Times employees are working remotely right now. Where are you working from these days?<br></strong>Mostly from my couch in my East Village apartment. If I’m feeling a little crazy, sometimes I’ll work from my bed or the kitchen.</p><p><strong>How do you start your day?<br></strong>I pull my pet guinea pig out of her cage so she can cuddle with me on the couch while I work, and I crack open a Diet Coke — the signature breakfast beverage of people from Atlanta.</p><p><strong>What is something you’ve worked on recently?<br></strong>Lately I’ve been doing some clean-up work on our free-trial experience. We have a lot of complicated logic to determine whether or not someone is eligible for a free trial with Cooking, so I’ve been working on simplifying it so it’s easier to make changes to it in the future.</p><p><strong>Tell us about a project you’ve worked on at The Times that you’re especially proud of.<br></strong>Last year, I wrote the API for our grocery lists feature, which was something I had been wanting to put in our app for a very long time. I worked with one front-end and one iOS engineer so that we could launch the product cross-platform, which was something I hadn’t done before. I use the feature almost every time I go grocery shopping!</p><p><strong>What was your first job?<br></strong>I was a hostess at Waffle House (another Southern staple). The official title was “Door Corps” and one of my biggest responsibilities was sweeping cigarette butts off of the sidewalk every hour.

Learn to separate your work from your ego — ask the dumb question, and ask for clarification when you don’t understand the answer to the dumb question the first time.

The reason this job can be so rewarding is because you end up accomplishing things you thought to be impossible.</p><h3>More in “Meeting…”</h3><p><a href=\"https://open.nytimes.com/meeting-jasmine-chan-5a8b71a16bd4\"><em>Meeting… Jasmine Chan, Engineering Manager at The New York Times</em></a><em><br></em><a href=\"https://open.nytimes.com/meeting-storm-hurwitz-senior-analyst-at-the-new-york-times-37013ad483bc\"><em>Meeting… Storm Hurwitz, Senior Analyst at The New York Times</em></a></p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=54a207411934\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://open.nytimes.com/meeting-tiffany-pe%C3%B3n-senior-software-engineer-54a207411934\">Meeting… Tiffany Peón, Senior Software Engineer at The New York Times</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://open.nytimes.com\">NYT Open</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 10 Jul 2020 15:06:05 +0000","feedId":10498,"bgimg":"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*sJncoIYsBYjjQdygqb39Ug.png","linkMd5":"67a49bdc34209ce78138e1140f00e127","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn70@2020_3/2020/08/25/00-55-46-985_45838a404a392ae7.webp","destWidth":1024,"destHeight":341,"sourceBytes":141036,"destBytes":26670,"author":"The NYT Open Team","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*sJncoIYsBYjjQdygqb39Ug.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn70@2020_3/2020/08/25/00-55-46-985_45838a404a392ae7.webp","https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=54a207411934":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn18@2020_6/2020/08/25/00-57-49-746_c9b934c4da0fd01b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598316946684},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:55:46","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:55:46","title":"Published Assets?

And they were out of order.</h4><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ib79f6uKs1OXktAZHZyZlw.jpeg\" /><figcaption>Illustration by Derek Abella</figcaption></figure><p>The New York Times has been publishing since 1851. At first, we printed dozens of articles a day in the paper, then we gradually added photographs, recipes and reviews. When we moved to the internet, we added slideshows, videos, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-spread.html\">interactives</a> and podcasts. Collectively, we call these items “publishing assets.” After nearly 170 years of publishing, we have accumulated over 59 million assets. And that number is constantly growing.</p><p>To process the number of assets that The Times has generated, <a href=\"https://open.nytimes.com/publishing-with-apache-kafka-at-the-new-york-times-7f0e3b7d2077\">we created a publishing pipeline</a> in 2017 using Apache Kafka open-source software. That year, we began storing every revision of every asset on a single-partition Kafka topic that we call the Monolog.</p><p>Think of the Monolog as a long, ever-growing list. When a new asset is published, it is added to the end of the Monolog. Numerous Times applications — such as the website, mobile apps and search index — constantly monitor the Monolog for new assets so they can refresh when new content is available.</p><p>In order to display an article online, our engineering teams must combine multiple assets, such as an article, an image and a reporter’s bio (we call this a “person asset”).</p><p>In database terms, data on the Monolog is normalized, but when the data is combined for display purposes it becomes denormalized. In order to render an article, the image and person assets need to appear on the Monolog prior to the article asset.</p><h3>Chronological Disorder</h3><p>It would make sense for the data on the Monolog to start with the first articles from 1851 and continue chronologically until the present day. As is the case with most things in software engineering, the reality is a bit different.</p><p>When we launched the Monolog in 2017, we immediately began adding new assets as they were published online. Shortly thereafter, we added a handful of historical articles from 2000 to 2016, including <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/20/technology/the-new-york-times-five-years-on-the-web.html\">a 2001 article</a> that commemorated The Times’s five-year anniversary on the web. We then added selected articles from 1950 through 2000, followed by three major bulk archive republishes that added articles from 1851 through 2000. To correct data bugs and introduce other enhancements, we did occasional bulk republishes that were much smaller.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/proxy/0*jYBqmGMkStWWjw_k\" /><figcaption><em>A Kafka topic, such as the visualization of our Monolog above, should be read from offset zero (bottom) to the latest offset (59 million, top). Because we added assets from different time frames in batches, the assets were out of chronological order.</em></figcaption></figure><p>This scattered asset loading process caused several problems:</p><p><strong>Chronological disorder. </strong>If someone wanted to find all of the assets for any given year, they would have to process all 59 million assets, which could take over 24 hours. This was especially problematic for machine learning or personalization projects that only needed data from the last couple of years.</p><p><strong>Topological disorder.</strong> Articles often reference other assets, such as images, recipes and people. Because we added assets published before 2017 to the Monolog in batches, assets that referenced each other were often at different places along the Monolog. These missing references led to an incomplete view when denormalizing an asset, such as an article with a missing image or a recipe review with a missing recipe.</p><p><strong>Duplicate disorder.</strong> Because of things like republishes and — ahem — bugs, there were often multiple copies of the same asset on the Monolog. In one case, there were over 900,000 duplicates. These duplicates took up space and forced unnecessary processing.</p><h3>Ordering the Monolog</h3><p>It was clear that the way the Monolog was ordered was unsustainable. My team decided that the best way to solve this problem was to create a new Monolog that was sorted in chronological and topological order. Ordering the Monolog chronologically meant we could use a Kafka feature to jump to a specific offset using a timestamp, meaning we could precisely get assets from a particular time frame without processing the whole thing. Ordering the Monolog topologically meant we could eliminate incomplete denormalized assets. And since we would be looking at all of the assets, we could remove all of the duplicates.</p><p>The question was: how would we accomplish this? Was this a big data problem to be solved with tools like Hadoop or Spark? Would a more traditional database fit the bill? Or, would the solution be something else?</p><p>The team started by inserting metadata for each asset into a SQL database. However, the need to correct data issues, especially missing references, meant a simple sort to order the data wouldn’t suffice. This approach led to a series of increasingly complex queries that took woefully long to run (we’re talking weeks in some cases). But more importantly, these queries did not produce a correctly ordered Monolog.</p><h3>Inspiration</h3><p>We needed a solution that ran quickly and efficiently. I was new to The Times, and my team asked me to take a fresh look at the ordering problem.</p><p>As I reviewed the previous work and struggled to understand the queries, I felt like SQL wasn’t the right tool for the job — it was getting in the way of progress. So I paused, took a step back and looked for an alternative approach.</p><p>While 59 million assets taking up 330 GiB of disk space is big, it is not big data big, which often falls in the range of billions of records or petabytes of data.</p><p>My new laptop had 16 GiB of memory, and I wondered if it could fit all 59 million assets in memory. I did the math: 16 GiB divided by 59 million was roughly 300 bytes. With some clever encoding, it seemed possible.</p><p>I would still need to persist data and I began thinking of alternatives to SQL. I had an ah-ha moment. An algorithm was beginning to materialize in my head.</p><h3>The Algorithm</h3><p>Key-value databases are extremely efficient for certain patterns of data access. I envisioned a multi-step algorithm which leveraged this efficiency.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*zpjI0fN4rVcvZB3F\" /><figcaption>Assets on the monolog are effectively reordered by date when inserted into a key-value database.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Step one</strong> would consume the entire Monolog and convert each asset into a small encoded format that preserves only essential information such as a unique id, the publication date, references to other assets and a data fingerprint used to detect duplicates. This encoded asset would then be inserted into the key-value database where the key is a unique publication date and the value is the encoded asset.</p><p>Multiple assets might share the same publication date because they were published on the same day — this was primarily an issue with assets that had been published before The Times had a website. To ensure that each asset has a unique date, we added nanoseconds to the date.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*x3WTo3z7AfsAQufM\" /><figcaption>Once the Monolog has been encoded and stored in the database, we can iterate through the assets by publication date, starting in 1851 and continuing through the present.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Step two</strong> would look for and resolve missing references. The algorithm would inspect each asset in chronological order and flag references to other assets that hadn’t yet been seen up to that point in time.</p><p>Later on, when a flagged reference was seen, we would resolve the problem by making a copy of the referrer and setting the publication date to just after the found asset by adding nanoseconds. The reference to the missing asset in the original referrer could then be deleted.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*x55Sz99L30n7NXHH_s0eJA.png\" /><figcaption>When resolving missing references, the algorithm might find an article with a reference to an image that appeared much later in the Monolog. To fix this problem, we would copy the article and set its publication date to just after the image’s publication date by adjusting nanoseconds.</figcaption></figure><p>Though this solution would fabricate revisions of assets that never occurred, it would do so in a way that did not alter history in a material way. It simply corrected the data to reflect what should have happened when the assets were first published. This solution is similar to a real-life scenario when an editor adds an image to an already published article, then republishes both the image and the article.</p><p><strong>Step three </strong>would look for duplicate assets once all of the missing references have been fixed. Once again, each asset would be inspected in chronological order and a record would be kept of the fingerprint of the previous revision of the asset. If the fingerprints are identical (accounting for deleted references), the latter one would be deleted.</p><p><strong>Step four</strong> would iterate through the assets one last time to fetch the original asset and adjust for altered references or publication dates. Everything would then be published to a new sorted Monolog Kafka topic.</p><h3>The implementation</h3><p>The algorithm drove a couple of critical requirements of the key-value database. It had to be able to efficiently iterate over the keys in chronological order and it had to work within the confines of available memory.</p><p>Not all key-value databases fulfill these requirements, but two types do: LSM-Trees and B-Trees. Because many teams at The Times use Go, I began searching for Go key-value databases and chose BadgerDB, an open-source LSM-Tree database that is actively maintained.</p><p>For step one of the algorithm, I was able to <a href=\"https://play.golang.org/p/ZeHQoXkOBU4\">encode each asset into 233 bytes</a> on average. This meant the majority of the data could be kept in memory at the same time. Using BadgerDB, it took about four hours to extract all 59 million assets, but most of that time was due to network latency talking to Kafka.</p><p>The remaining steps required that we iterate through all 59 million assets. These proved to be very fast as well, taking seven to 15 minutes depending on the task (up to 140,000 assets per second). This was an enormous win.</p><p>By having the advantage of speed on our side, the cost of failure was low and we could experiment with getting the complex details of implementation just right. In the end, it took about eight weeks to get to a final solution (which was still faster than the five months spent on the SQL approach).</p><h3>Order is Restored</h3><p>After hundreds of iterations and tweaking, the algorithm was refined and finalized. The production version runs in the cloud on a virtual machine not that different from my laptop. After data is extracted from Kafka, it only takes about 90 minutes to do the entire ordering process. It takes another day and a half to re-publish the ordered assets to a new Kafka topic.</p><p>By removing duplicates, we reduced the number of assets to just over 35 million. The offset and publication date now increase in tandem and we can easily pull all assets from a particular year.</p><p>The results are beautiful:</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/853/0*GPP2VRRbbHNj4lnW\" /><figcaption>The sorted Monolog shows every asset published from 1851 to the present day in one continuous line. Nearly half of all Times assets have been published in the last 20 years.</figcaption></figure><p>When many of today’s technology problems entail enormous amounts of data, it may not seem cutting edge or cool to work on a problem that can be solved on a single laptop. But finding a solution to a complex problem is satisfying, no matter the size.</p><p><em>Doug Donohoe is a Senior Software Engineer for the New York Times, living in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

The event is time for our colleagues to experiment with new ideas or iterate on old ones. This year, our colleagues worked on over 96 projects and participated in 24 peer-led workshops over five meeting-free days.</em></p><p><em>We asked some of our colleagues to share their projects and what they learned.</em></p><h3>AcroBot (Acronym Bot)</h3><p><strong>By Aiyana Brooks (software engineer) and Alice Fung (senior data analyst)</strong></p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/734/1*YwwW-SNl5vd0YUae-0QsWA.gif\" /><figcaption>AcroBot lets New York Times employees look up acronyms frequently used at The Times.</figcaption></figure><p>AcroBot is a Slack bot that enables users in <em>The New York Times</em> workspace to easily look up acronyms used within the company. This can be extremely helpful when onboarding new employees, or when forming cross-functional teams, as teams tend to have their own sets of jargon. The bot provides the definition of the acronym along with helpful context about how the acronym is used.</p><p>AcroBot is built using Python and uses the Slack API to interact with Slack. The data is backed-up on a Google Sheet, which makes it extremely easy to share and view the complete dataset.</p><h3>Auditorial</h3><p><strong>By Jeremy Chen (senior software engineer)</strong></p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*tL16v_CtorFOIZE2nQmdog.png\" /><figcaption>Auditorial parses New York Times audio transcripts and suggests relevant Times Tags, or keywords that are used in our search and recommendation engines.</figcaption></figure><p>Auditorial uses the Google Natural Language API to process <em>New York Times</em> audio transcript data and parse important and salient keywords. It then subsequently recommends relevant Times Tags using the NYT Semantic API.</p><p>The goal of this project was to explore the feasibility and efficacy of programatically analyzing and classifying audio content. Ideally, this is a service that we can integrate into the audio publishing workflow to promote and encourage the application of Times Tags, and to increase the effectiveness of our search and recommendation engines.</p><p>By the end of Maker Week, I had built a full-stack web app that displays up to 10 recommended Times Tags for the top 10 salient keywords. The app also has a tab that lets you observe the actual data returned by the Natural Language API.</p><p>The service itself simply intakes a URL that hosts transcript data in the form of an .srt or .txt file. The transcript data is first sanitized (by removing things like timestamps, speaker tags and noise tags) before entering the classification pipeline.</p><p>Theoretically, since the input is just text, Auditorial is not just limited to audio content; it can be leveraged for any data that is in the form of text.</p><p>Technology used on the back-end includes Typescript, Node.js, Express, Google Natural Language API and NYT Semantic API, while the technology used on the front-end includes React, Context API, React Router and React Bootstrap.</p><h3>Automating Data Testing with Great Expectations and Apache Airflow</h3><p><strong>By Eddie Velez (lead software engineer), Amandeep Singh (consultant) and Brian Lavery (senior software engineer)</strong></p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ZeRUQp8kHWXpaB4A2vsnmg.png\" /><figcaption>The flowchart depicting what the testing process does if data doesn’t meet data analysts’ expectations.</figcaption></figure><p>For our Maker Week project, we created an automated testing process that notifies data analysts and engineers if their data doesn’t meet their expectations; it also stops any associated data processing jobs. We built on top of the Apache Airflow and Great Expectations open-source projects to create a reusable piece of code called an “Airflow operator,” which interrogates the data in a Google BigQuery database to see if it meets expectations. Users can write their expectations to a JSON file and check it into Github along with their data processing code.</p><h3>Collaborative Crossword Chrome Extension</h3><p><strong>By Chandana Bhimarao (data analyst intern), Jasper Cheung (back-end engineering intern), Jenna Kolodny (front-end engineering intern), Stephanie Lu (front-end engineering intern) and Jenna Kim (product design intern)</strong></p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*twTKCB2DycJozxsTmGySGA.png\" /><figcaption>Times interns built a prototype where multiple users can play the Crossword together.</figcaption></figure><p>Our team of interns created a Chrome extension that enables collaborative play on <em>The New York Times</em> Crossword. Users in the same session can utilize a chat box and view each others’ progress in real time, effectively allowing them to solve a crossword together.</p><p>None of us had created a Chrome extension before, so our project involved a lot of learning. We took inspiration from and reviewed the source code of Netflix Party, an extension that synchronizes video playback so that friends can watch movies together remotely. We implemented real-time communication and collaboration using web sockets: clients either create a session or join an existing session, and are then connected to the same server. When a user types in a crossword cell, the information is sent to the server, and the other users’ crossword grids are updated accordingly.</p><h3>Guide to Colorblind-Safe Data Visualization</h3><p><strong>By MacKenzie Gibson (manager, Data &#38; Insights)</strong></p><p>Analysts often use color as a way to visualize data and present insights to stakeholders. While color can be a powerful tool to help us interpret trends and extract meaning from datasets, there are no accessibility standards set by <em>The New York Times’s</em> Data &#38; Insights group.</p><p>I completed research about colorblindness, how color is perceived and best practices in creating colorblind-safe color palettes. I compiled this research into a guide for creating data visualizations that are colorblind accessible. Additionally, I created a few colorblind-safe themes in Chartio that can be used throughout <em>the Times company</em>. By following the proposed guidelines we can create a more inclusive environment with more effective visual representation of data.</p><h3>Marcy Lab Hackathon</h3><p><strong>By Ethan Lipkind (software engineer), Daniel Antonio (software engineer), Aditya Natraj (senior software engineer), Laisha Calalpa (Marcy Lab fellow), Enmanuel de la Nuez (Marcy Lab fellow), Devonte Duncan (Marcy Lab fellow) and Mark Griffith (Marcy Lab fellow)</strong></p><p>This Maker Week, we partnered with The Marcy Lab School, an immersive program based in Brooklyn which creates pathways into tech careers for underestimated youth, empowering them to take control of their future. Our goal was to guide a group of Marcy Lab fellows as they conducted research and built a full-stack data visualization application focused around a topic of their choosing.</p><p>After spending the first day brainstorming ideas, the fellows defined a specific research question focused on racial inequality in maternal morbidity outcomes. The following day, we guided them as they searched the internet for a dataset that would give them insight into their research topic. Eventually they decided to use a dataset from the CDC, which had to be transformed using a very dense user guide as a map. Next, we helped them massage the data and train a machine-learning model set using scikit-learn and Google Colab. We then guided them as they built an application that allowed a user to input certain maternal characteristics and generate a data visualization representing the complications most likely to occur during childbirth according to their model’s prediction. Finally, we helped the fellows put together a presentation, which they delivered to over 200 <em>Times</em> employees during the Maker Week show and tell event at the end of the week.</p><p>We were blown away by the level of curiosity, determination and raw talent these young people demonstrated throughout Maker Week. To go from an idea to a full-stack web application backed by a machine-learning model in four days was truly remarkable work. We hope this will be the first of many collaborative learning experiences between <em>The Times</em> and Marcy Lab!</p><h3>NYT Cooking — Calories &#38; Grocery Features</h3><p><strong>By Lauren Yew (senior software engineer) and Kathy Li (data science intern)</strong></p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*vIxa_UjLkt4GSyi0qVBBNQ.png\" /><figcaption>A collage showing the calorie count and grocery list features developed during Maker Week.</figcaption></figure><p>For this project, we built several features for the NYT Cooking app, adding calories counts to recipes, the ability to filter by calorie count and grocery lists that are sorted by aisle. We also built a feature that allows a user to copy ingredients to a calorie-tracking app. We succeeded in providing demos for each feature, and we laid out the steps for them to be integrated with the production version.</p><h3>NYT Cooking Videos on Apple TV</h3><p><strong>By Mark Paul Keefe (senior software engineer), Kate Cullinane (senior product designer) and Jamel Charouel (software engineer)</strong></p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/451/1*zGx_DEtcVuxxR53i180MVQ.gif\" /><figcaption>A prototype showing what NYT Cooking might look like on Apple TV.</figcaption></figure><p>We set out to create an app that allows Apple TV owners to discover our popular NYT Cooking videos in a way that is effortless, fun and engaging.</p><h3>NYT Mini Bot</h3><p><strong>By An Yu (software engineer)</strong></p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*eBulFRc3VUtic_1dDdW8dw.jpeg\" /><figcaption>The NYT Mini Bot prints out the daily Mini Crossword using a Raspberry Pi.</figcaption></figure><p>The quarantine had made me antsy, and I wanted to create something tangible in my personal time. I had a Raspberry Pi lying around and I was musing about what to make with it when I came across a project that printed out comics on a little receipt. I loved it, and with Maker Week coming up, thought it would be neat to make a bot that printed out a little version of <em>The New York Times</em> Mini Crossword of the day.</p><p>This was my first electronics project, so while the concept was simple, I hit a number of small bumps along the way. I also wanted to make it in a way that could be replicated by fans of the Mini outside of <em>The Times</em>, so I took the scraping route to retrieve the Crossword instead of using an internal API.</p><p>It was refreshing getting to learn and build something different from day-to-day work, but also something that wasn’t entirely screen-based. I hope others can enjoy building their own <em>Times</em> Mini Crossword bot at home!</p><h3>Readerversary</h3><p><strong>By Ami Berger (software engineer), Anish Vankayalapati (data engineering intern), Anna Davies (scrum master), Anna Guidi (data analyst), Deepak Goel (technology intern), Denise Wang (technology intern), Jenni Lee (product design intern), Leah Anton (product designer), Michael Abela (technology intern), Rashika Singh (data engineering intern), Saadhvi Umesh (technology intern) and Zhen Xu (senior data analyst)</strong></p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/418/1*Znzmfcaswe1QhosCp8fFqg.gif\" /><figcaption>The prototype features year-in-review stats, such as number of recipes cooked and most-read journalists.</figcaption></figure><p>For Maker Week we made Readerversary, an experience that celebrates our readers’ subscription anniversaries by providing a look into how they consume <em>Times</em> content. Through teamwork, we built a complete app and created a design that is in line with the Times brand.</p><h3>Reimagining NYT Opinion</h3><p><strong>By Ilya Gurevich (software engineer), Charlotte Rymar (graphic designer), Hannah Towey (marketing intern) and Hannah Miao (marketing intern)</strong></p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*x0_FBhyY4x3tlq2YQlcEQw.png\" /><figcaption>The reimagined Opinion prototype (bottom) features more information about the section and clearer visual cues that the page is part of the Opinion section.</figcaption></figure><p>We reimagined the Opinion section of <em>The New York Times</em> with improved visual acuity and labeling that signals to the reader that they are reading content in the Opinion section. We did this by normalizing headline fonts, utilizing a new logo, adding the Opinion blue for bylines, and we added descriptions for columnist and op-ed contributor roles. We also came up with a new product called “Dialogues” that allows for packaged opinion articles that cover a similar topic.</p><h3>Saving Maker Week</h3><p><strong>By Meghna Dholakia (product designer), Christian Evans (engineering manager), Nina Feinberg (senior product designer), Justin Fuller (software engineer), Erik Kernan (associate product manager), Yassi Mortensen (software engineer) and Jenny Xing (software engineer)</strong></p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*CojG578143UwbZomVD8VmA.gif\" /><figcaption>A basic prototype showing what an expanded save feature might look like.</figcaption></figure><p>Today, <em>New York Times</em> users can save articles to a list that is available only to them. We decided to build on the current save experience by creating a feature where users can sort their saved articles into collections. We also wanted to have the ability to make collections public so users can share them with friends or family. We hypothesized that giving people more control over their saved articles would make them more likely to revisit and share them.</p><p>To accomplish this, we formed a cross-functional team in the days leading up to Maker Week, based on a shared interest in saved articles. We bounced around some ideas before the week began, settling on a plan Monday morning.</p><p>After deciding on our approach, we began to divide and conquer. In addition to building this feature, we also used this opportunity to learn new skills and experiment with new technologies. So, several of us stepped outside of our comfort zones for the week.</p><p>Our priority was to explore designs and to research technical limitations. Then we began designing and building components and even conducted some informal user research. On Thursday and Friday, our engineers wrote code like their fingers were on fire, so we could present a working feature at an internal show and tell event on the last day of Maker Week.</p><p>We’re proud of everything we did, but we would love to see this go further. We think there’s a real opportunity to give <em>New York Times</em> readers more ways to organize and manage the stories that intrigue them.</p><h3>Stylebot: Learn Times Style</h3><p><strong>By Mike Abrams (senior editor), Veronique Brossier (senior iOS engineer), Anna Dubenko (deputy audience director), Penina Kessler (software engineer), Aditi Sarkar (senior data analyst) and Isaac White (senior software engineer)</strong></p><p>There’s no great way for editors, writers and others around the newsroom to get better acquainted with <em>New York Times </em>style. The physical stylebook is out of date (we update style too frequently for it to be useful) and perusing entries digitally is less than ideal. <em>Times</em> employees can look up specific entries using Stylebot, a Slack bot that responds to queries on specific terms, but that’s only good for entries they search for. We added a feature to Stylebot that allows users to opt in to receive a random entry from the stylebook via DM. The entry is also posted to an existing channel for style questions, so that users can discuss the tip of the day.</p><p>We used Node.js and Botkit to enhance the existing stylebook Slack bot that replies to DMs and slash commands, Sequelize and Postgres to persist subscribed users and previously sent tips, and a small cron npm module to easily schedule the daily tip.</p><h3>Times ARchive</h3><p><strong>By Sara Samuel (technology intern)</strong></p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/480/1*vltkLtvTaqyd_d02vtmWrA.gif\" /><figcaption>The augmented reality app would allow readers to view archived New York Times newspapers.</figcaption></figure><p>Times ARchive is an augmented reality app that allows readers to view archived <em>New York Times</em> newspapers in physical space.</p><p>Most readers probably do not have physical copies of archived papers and can only access them in PDF form. The <em>Times</em> ARchive app enables readers to view the newspapers as they would have appeared during the time periods in which they were published.

This was a question we faced this summer as interns with <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/crosswords\">The New York Times Games</a> team, which is working remotely due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>The team typically develops new game prototypes every month to test with Times subscribers. They assigned us — a team of six interns with skills in design, tech and data — an ambitious task for our summer internship project: to design and prototype a digital game in three weeks. To do this remotely, we had to get creative with our design and playtest approaches.</p><h3>Initial Ideation and Game Design</h3><p>The first step was to decide what kind of game we wanted to make. We were encouraged to explore fresh ideas, so we held an ideation session over video chat to brainstorm game concepts.</p><p>To guide our thinking, we filled out ideation worksheets and framed our ideas in the form of questions, such as “How might we make a game about space?” We then voted on our favorite concepts. Our initial ideas were wide-ranging, but we chose to make a “clock game”: where players must swap the mixed-up numbers on a clock to find the correct order.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*qBGLljsnhaJuPbl7\" /><figcaption><em>The original ideation worksheet for Animatic. Our goal was to make a game that models the passage of time and restores order amidst chaos</em></figcaption></figure><p>After we settled on a concept, we began building sample prototypes on paper and in Google Jamboard, where we could test our ideas with our families and members of the Games team.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*7NJ6owq9vQFCGWIJ\" /></figure><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/987/0*KyOYY0fZ246l3Anw\" /><figcaption>Left: Our intern team and Times staffer Sam Von Ehren playtested an early prototype based on sliding puzzles with Robert Vinluan, product designer on the Games team. Right: <em>A Google Jamboard prototype of the “clock game.”</em></figcaption></figure><p>To make our game appeal to a wider range of players (and to make it more interesting), we replaced the numbers with visual icons. We wanted these icons to indicate linear progression since our game was centered around the themes of time and evolution. Our first design showed an embryo developing into a chick. (To answer the age-old question, we decided that the egg comes before the chicken!)</p><p>Milena Correa, game design intern, recognized that the sequential visuals evoked animation. We realized we could refer to the icons as “frames” that could reveal a simple animation when arranged in the right order. Our source of inspiration changed from a clock to a zoopraxiscope, an early motion picture device that cycled through images rapidly to animate them. This informed the name of our game: Animatic.</p><p>Once we had the visual metaphor sorted out, we had to decide on key interactions. A major component of gameplay was how players would move the frames around. We explored many possibilities. Through trial and error, we decided that each frame could be swapped with the frames two spaces to the left or right. This gave the gameplay two layers of complexity: players had to recognize the sequence of the frames, and they had to strategize about how to move the frames into the correct positions.</p><h4><strong>Product Design</strong></h4><p>We paid close attention to how Animatic would fit with the rest of the Games portfolio, especially through its visual design. Jenna Kim, product design intern, began conceptualizing the game’s visual design early in the development process.</p><p>With a zoopraxiscope as our inspiration, Correa and Kim decided to transform the original clock layout into a film reel. This made the theme and objective clearer, while elevating the game’s visual aesthetic.</p><p>Kim designed the icons and color palette with simplicity in mind. To make our game accessible to diverse audiences, we chose easily recognizable symbols for each set of icons that visually indicated some sort of change over time. We settled on four sequences: a chick hatching, an apple being eaten, a burning match and a pizza being eaten.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/686/0*ygNERMctME5jui6B\" /><figcaption><em>Initial designs and sketches of possible icons.</em></figcaption></figure><p>A big part of the design process was figuring out how to get players to start their sequence at the top of the film reel and continue clockwise. Kim tried to highlight the top of the reel in various ways, such as with arrows, symbols and even words. After some testing, we decided that the arrow was the most intuitive option.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*RziquNKiaG42hfz1\" /><figcaption><em>Visual cue explorations and the implementation of the film reel design.</em></figcaption></figure><h4><strong>iOS and Web Builds</strong></h4><p>Animatic is the first Games prototype that was simultaneously built for iOS and the web. This allowed us explore how the game might feel both in-browser and in-app. It also enabled us to take advantage of Rohan Shaiva, Shandler Mason and Stephanie Lu’s diverse tech skill sets. To keep both versions of the prototype in sync, we communicated frequently and checked in daily over video calls.</p><p>Shaiva and Mason built the iOS prototype in Swift, while Lu created the web version using React. The highly interactive nature of the game presented a number of technical challenges. For example, animating the frames and showing their swapping movements required a carefully timed sequence of transitions and events. To allow for this chaining, Shaiva and Lu implemented code asynchronously — the animations run in parallel with the code that handles the logic. That way, if you’ve made the winning move, you won’t see the “Congratulations!” message until you’ve seen the frames swap.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/863/0*EO1V-9rATI8IpFnY\" /></figure><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*8Sy3GFbfgqZQdrh9\" /></figure><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/616/0*yLbubY2gLAndjhU3\" /><figcaption><em>Early versions of the iOS and web prototypes.</em></figcaption></figure><p>Because users interact with mobile and web interfaces differently — through tapping and clicking — we wanted to create a single interface that was consistent between our iOS and web prototypes. The original designs for both platforms contained a swap button that users would click or tap after choosing two frames to swap. However, we found that this approach required too much clicking and tapping, so Kim worked with the developers to explore different interactions. We decided that drag-and-drop for iOS and click-to-swap for the web made the gameplay most engaging.</p><h3>Test and iterate</h3><p>Usually, the Games team playtests their prototypes with users in person so they can closely follow how the users interact with the game. Our challenge was to recreate this experience in a virtual setting with members of the Games team and the wider Times intern cohort — these sessions were coordinated by Natalie Erjavec, data analyst intern.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*itUgwAvx1hawTR9s\" /><figcaption><em>Playtesting as a group.</em></figcaption></figure><p>Although we hadn’t yet deployed our web prototype, we found ways to test it out. We sent playtesters a temporary link generated by ngrok, an application that creates access to a local development server. Playtesters then shared their screens with us so we could observe their facial reactions and their interactions with the game.</p><p>The process was trickier to figure out on iOS. Playtesters couldn’t download the app on their phones or run the latest development build, which would take too much time to set up.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/0*9THGh0KvqJtIAYeJ\" /><figcaption><em>The final game, Animatic</em></figcaption></figure><p>Shaiva developed a way to test the game over Zoom. During calls, he shared his computer screen and showed everyone the latest prototype on an emulated iPhone. Then, he gave playtesters remote control of his screen, which allowed them to play the game. This approach required several layers of abstraction and suffered from an occasional lag, but it ended up being an effective way to playtest.</p><p>Our remote playtesting hacks enabled us to obtain crucial feedback to improve our game. We made several improvements based on playtester feedback, including adding easier levels. Some players found it difficult to see where the sequence started, so we added a fade-in transition to indicate the order of the frames.</p><p>While Animatic is a prototype and not a fully polished game, we are proud of what we were able to accomplish in three weeks. We were able to leverage our different skill sets and collaborate cross-functionally, which allowed us to work efficiently and with fewer hiccups.</p><p>Making Animatic was a core part of our summer internships.

Where are you working from these days?<br></strong>I am working from my apartment in Harlem with my dog, my partner and his dog.</p><p><strong>How do you start your day?<br></strong>My partner and I team up on the start of the day. We both get up, and he takes the dogs for their morning walk as I get coffee ready. We then both sit together and read the news as we have our coffee before we dive into our first meetings of the day.</p><p><strong>What is something you’ve worked on recently?<br></strong>I’m currently helping bring standardization and a data perspective to our recommended articles on article pages. The work is very detailed, but it is exciting to help set the product teams and newsroom up to more efficiently and effectively compare each of the recommendation blocks with the goal of helping readers access the depth and breadth of our coverage.</p><p><strong>Tell us about a project you’ve worked on at The Times that you’re especially proud of.<br></strong>Slowly, but surely, helping The Times understand how to classify whether an article pageview was “engaged.” Our product teams care about measuring engaged pageviews, as a way to understand whether our readers are getting value from the product experience. This is a long-term project that has many stakeholders, so it is very much a work-in-progress. But, leveraging data to help readers find stories they want to engage with is a dream of mine.</p><p>There are so many reader behaviors to account for in thinking about this classification problem, all of which are interesting to better understand and surface for my product stakeholders.</p><p><strong>What was your first job?<br></strong>I worked at the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual &#38; Transgender Community Center in New York, essentially creating statewide HIV-prevention campaigns and advising over 50 LGBTQ organizations across the state on their digital marketing strategy.</p><p><strong>What is something most people don’t know about you?<br></strong>I have never eaten meat. I was raised a vegetarian!</p><p><strong>What is your secret to career success?<br></strong>Reflective persistence. I think it is very important to consistently and frequently take stock of what is making me happy and to trust that instinct. As I hone my ability to pinpoint what inspires happiness, I lean into making those drivers a part of my overall career strategy — be that what jobs I apply for, what problems I look to solve at work and how I advocate for myself.</p><p><strong>What is your superpower?<br></strong>Process thinking. I am, sometimes to a fault, very process oriented. But, I love efficiency.</p><p><strong>What are you inspired by?<br></strong>Passion, intellect and love.</p><p><strong>Name one thing you’re excited about right now (can be non-work related).<br></strong>My Intern! I will manage an intern this summer and she totally rocks. I am thrilled that The Times is still hiring and offering internship opportunities during the coronavirus pandemic, and I cannot wait to learn alongside her.</p><p><strong>What is your best advice for someone starting to work in your field?<br></strong>Technical skills are great, but do not forget to actively seek to grow your data storytelling skills.</p><h3>More in “Meeting…”</h3><p><a
