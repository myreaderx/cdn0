Email marketing is actually thriving.</p> \n<p>In HubSpot's <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/state-of-marketing\">2020 State of Marketing Report</a>, roughly 80% of marketers said their brand's email engagement had improved in the last year. Our researchers also discovered that brands make an average of <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/state-of-marketing\">$42 for every dollar spent on email advertising</a>.</p> \n<p>mail marketing is still widely used and continues to offer many benefits to marketers. It can boost brand awareness, increase web traffic, delight your audience, and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-for-every-funnel-stage\">ease subscribers through the customer funnel</a>.</p> \n<p>While email marketing isn't a new strategy,, many marketers still struggle to grow and maintain the size of their subscriber lists.</p> \n<p>But you shouldn't throw in the towel if you're struggling to build your list of contacts. Like any great marketing strategy, you'll need to get in the mindset of your customers to determine why they're likely to subscribe -- or unsubscribe -- from your email list.</p> \n<p>To help you think like your subscribers, I polled 400 consumers to ask them about why they've joined or removed themselves from marketing email lists in the past. Here's what they said.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Email%20Marketing-Jul-28-2020-01-17-22-69-PM.png?width=1500&amp;name=Email%20Marketing-Jul-28-2020-01-17-22-69-PM.png\" alt=\"Email Marketing\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=More%20on%20@HubSpot’s%20blog%20post%20here:%20https://bit.ly/inboxmrkting%20pic.twitter.com/aidNbJsii5\"><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 15px;\"></span></span></a></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 18px;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=More%20on%20@HubSpot’s%20blog%20post%20here:%20https://bit.ly/inboxmrkting%20pic.twitter.com/aidNbJsii5\">Share this image on Twitter!</a></em></span></p> \n<h2>Why Consumers Subscribe to Marketing Emails</h2> \n<p>The first question I asked consumers was, \"Why do you most commonly subscribe to marketing emails or email newsletters?\"</p> \n<p>It's apparent that consumers sign up for emails that provide direct value to them.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Why%20Consumers%20Subscribe%20and%20Unsubscribe%20from%20Email%20%5BNew%20Data%5D.png?width=600&amp;name=Why%20Consumers%20Subscribe%20and%20Unsubscribe%20from%20Email%20%5BNew%20Data%5D.png\" alt=\"why consumers subscribe to marketing email\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<p style=\"font-size: 10px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://luc.id\" style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: italic;\">Data Source</a></p> \n<p>Below is a quick breakdown of what each result means for marketers, as well as examples of effective emails that leveraged their audience interests.</p> \n<h3>1. Deals, Discount Promo Codes, and Coupons</h3> \n<p>Roughly 28% of consumers say they subscribe to branded emails because they \"want to be notified about sales, promo codes, or coupons from a company.\"</p> \n<p>It's not shocking that emails promoting deals and sales are the top preference of consumers. By now, many of us have either subscribed to an email like this for personal use, or skimmed our inbox looking for promo codes before a big shop.</p> \n<p>Although these emails are primarily for announcing deals or ways that your prospect can save money, you can still also use them for other promotions. For example, while prioritizing a sale, deal, or coupon code at the top of the email, you can also share news about a new product or blog posts at the bottom. Just keep in mind that your subscribers signed up to get the best bang for their buck, then continue to come up with ways to delight them.</p> \n<p>Here's a great example. When you subscribe to Postmates, you can ask to receive emails with promotions and coupons. Once subscribed, Postmates will send you semi-regular coupon codes and news about restaurant-specific sales:</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Why%20Consumers%20Subscribe%20and%20Unsubscribe%20from%20Email%20%5BNew%20Data%5D-1.png?width=200&amp;name=Why%20Consumers%20Subscribe%20and%20Unsubscribe%20from%20Email%20%5BNew%20Data%5D-1.png\" alt=\"Postmates discount marketing email\" width=\"200\" style=\"width: 200px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<p>As a subscriber, I personally love the Postmates email because it stands by its mission to send me discount information. Whenever I consider ordering in, I search through my inbox to see if they sent any promo codes recently. When they do, I don't hesitate to get my meal delivery from this app over other competitors.</p> \n<h3>2. Links to Valuable Content From the Brand</h3> \n<p>Not all audiences are looking to get the latest deals on products. Sometimes, people subscribe to emails just for the sake of learning new things. This explains why one-quarter of participants say they subscribe to emails because they want to regularly receive \"a brand's content (i.e. blogs, videos, graphics).\"</p> \n<p>Although creating an email for your blog posts or branded content might not seem like it will benefit purchases or ROI directly, these types of emails still offer a number of benefits that can impact the bottom line.</p> \n<p>For example, those who subscribe will get to see content from you that demonstrates why your brand is a trusted voice in your industry. After seeing and consuming valuable content from you regularly, your company could be the first that comes to mind when a subscriber needs to purchase a product that you sell.</p> \n<p>Additionally, although content-based emails might not focus on promotions, this doesn't mean you can't include one within the mix of links shared in an email. Aside from subtly including promotions in one of these emails, you could also link to blog or video content aimed at lead generation.</p> \n<p>To give you an example of a content-based marketing email, take a look at HubSpot's Service Blog email. Each day, the Service Blog sends the posts that were published the same day to subscribers. While the content is mostly informative, we occasionally mix in other promotions, such as the call-to-action to visit our new Website Blog.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Why%20Consumers%20Subscribe%20and%20Unsubscribe%20from%20Email%20%5BNew%20Data%5D-3.png?width=200&amp;name=Why%20Consumers%20Subscribe%20and%20Unsubscribe%20from%20Email%20%5BNew%20Data%5D-3.png\" alt=\"HubSpot Service Blog Email\" width=\"200\" style=\"width: 200px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<h3>3. Company Announcements</h3> \n<p>A number of brands choose to use their emails to show audiences the inner-workings of their company. These emails might include press release-styled announcements, information about the staff, or posts from the company's corporate blog.</p> \n<p>While this content might not directly value audiences as much as coupons or educational content, it still helps brands to establish themselves as credible and successful to audiences who are interested in watching them grow. This might be why 16% of those I polled subscribe purely to get company-specific announcements in their inbox.</p> \n<h3>4. Mixes of Content, Promotion, and Company News</h3> \n<p>While 10% of participants selected \"All of the above\" as their primary email subscription reasoning, 14% chose \"Other.\" These results might hint that groups of email subscribers might enjoy different types of content in one email.</p> \n<p>As you get to know your email audience, center your emails around the content you promised email recipients on their subscriber form. But, consider including one or two promotions that break your usual email norm to see if you can diversify your emails a bit more.</p> \n<p>For example, if you have an audience subscribed to your company blog's email, consider subtly including a coupon or discount at the bottom -- after your blog content -- to see if you can gain conversions.</p> \n<h3>5. Other Reasons</h3> \n<p>Interestingly, only 5% of consumers said they commonly sign up for emails to learn about new products from a brand. Additionally, although many companies will offer discounts when consumers sign up for their email newsletter, just 2% say they sign up for emails primarily for these tactics.</p> \n<p>Although the minority of participants chose the options listed above, you might still want to consider experimenting with them in case they work for you, or your audience prefers a mix of content.</p> \n<h2>Why Consumers Unsubscribe to Marketing Emails</h2> \n<p>Once marketers build out their email list, the next challenge they'll face is maintaining it.</p> \n<p>And, sometimes, even if you have great email engagement or a winning formula for email success, you'll see a random dip in subscribers. \\</p> \n<p>Why could this be? Have people gotten bored with your content? Have they found another competing brand with a better newsletter? Are they just over email altogether?</p> \n<p>The truth is, a bump in your unsubscribe rate could be due to super simple -- and easily fixable -- logistical reasons.</p> \n<p>When I asked consumers, \"What's the most common reason why you unsubscribe from marketing emails?\" most participants sighted reasons other than the quality of email content.</p> \n<p>In fact, 51% say they unsubscribe because \"emails come too often.\"</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Why%20Consumers%20Subscribe%20and%20Unsubscribe%20from%20Email%20%5BNew%20Data%5D-2.png?width=600&amp;name=Why%20Consumers%20Subscribe%20and%20Unsubscribe%20from%20Email%20%5BNew%20Data%5D-2.png\" alt=\"Why do you most commonly unsubscribe from marketing email\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<p style=\"font-size: 10px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://luc.id\" style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: italic;\">Data Source</a></p> \n<p>Below, I'll explain what frequency-related unsubscriptions mean for email marketers, as well as break down some of the other major subscription barriers.</p> \n<h3>1. Email Frequency</h3> \n<p>While 34% of those surveyed say they most commonly unsubscribe from email lists because \"emails come too often. [More than once per day.],\" 17% say, \"Emails come too often. [More than once per week.]</p> \n<p>Despite stats like those above, and the fear that too many emails will result in high unsubscribe rates, most marketers still send multiple weekly and daily emails. According to our State of Marketing Report, <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/state-of-marketing\">more than 50% of marketers</a> send emails between three and eight times per week.</p> \n<p>So, how do you stick to an effective email cadence without losing subscribers? Keep reading to learn about a few preventative measures.</p> \n<h4>Preventing Frequency-Related Unsubscription</h4> \n<p>If your audience begins to cite frequency as a reason for unsubscribing, or you suspect you might be sending too many emails based on the lower click or open rates throughout the week, consider dropping one to two of your regular emails, or combining two emails scheduled for the same day.</p> \n<p>Once you consolidate your emails, see if your unsubscription or spam rates lower, while paying attention increases in engagement metrics like open rate or click-through rates. If you see your metrics fluctuate for the better, you might want to identify more ways to consolidate your brand's email.</p> \n<p>If you absolutely can't consolidate your emails, make sure that you're transparent about how many you'll be sending subscribers on your subscribe form. This will ensure that all subscribers know what type of content and email frequency they're signing up for upfront and might weed out audiences who will quickly unsubscribe.</p> \n<h3>2. Low-Value Content</h3> \n<p>Although content isn't the biggest driver of unsubscriptions, it still can be a factor.</p> \n<p>While 17% of participants commonly unsubscribe from emails that feel \"spammy or over promotional,\" 9% will unsubscribe if the content is \"no longer valuable.\"</p> \n<p>The result above isn't that surprising. When's the last time you unsubscribed from an email that you used to love getting in your inbox?</p> \n<p>Luckily, there are a number of tactics you can try to prevent your content from getting too stale or spammy.</p> \n<h4>How to Prevent Content-Related Unsubscribes</h4> \n<p>First, do a deep dive into <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/metrics-email-marketers-should-be-tracking\">your email metrics</a>.</p> \n<p>If you're seeing<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/metrics-email-marketers-should-be-tracking\"> low open rates, click-through rates, high skim-to-read-rate ratios, as well as unsubscribes or spam reports related to poor content</a>, it might be time to audit the content you're sharing in each email, test out new types of content, and avoid any sharing things that might disengage your audience.</p> \n<p>Along with looking at hard metrics, you should also consider the content you're creating for your audience before you hit send. Ask yourself questions like, \"Is this email valuable to my audience?\", \"Does it over-promote my products?\", \"Does the content in this email align with how I marketed this email subscription in the first place?\", and \"Is this content on brand?\"</p> \n<p>If you have a large audience with a number of different interests. You might also worry that some audiences will love the links you're sharing in your email while others might be interested in other topics. If that's the case, you can also consider email segmentation.</p> \n<p>With <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/email-list-segmentation\">email segmentation</a>, you can break your list of contacts into separate lists to ensure that people with vastly different interests are only getting sent content that will interest them.</p> \n<p>For example, since HubSpot Blog readers are primarily interested in marketing, sales, service, or website development, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/subscriptions\">we have daily and weekly email lists for each of our blog properties</a>. This way, if you're a marketer interested in web development, you can subscribe to our Marketing Blog and Website Blog emails without seeing Sales or Service content that relates less to your field.</p> \n<h3>3. Unexpected Promotions or Content</h3> \n<p>Along with content that isn't valuable, 10% of participants primarily unsubscribe from emails that don't provide content they expected to receive.</p> \n<p>Roughly 5% of participants say they most commonly unsubscribe from emails that they \"didn't sign up for\" in the first place, while another 5% says they primarily unsubscribe from emails that \"don't offer content, promotions, or coupons\" that the brand described when marketing the subscription.</p> \n<h4>Avoiding Unsolicited Email Content</h4> \n<p>As an email marketer, it's your job to understand your audience and send content they'll engage with. Meanwhile, consumers that sign up for your email will expect you to send them the valuable content they asked for when signing up. When you blast them with emails they won't like or didn't ask for, they might trust your brand a little bit less.</p> \n<p>For example, if you market a daily newsletter that promises expert tips from thought leaders, blog posts, or coupons, and instead send semi-daily newsletters that promote only products with no discounts, your audiences might not be too happy.</p> \n<p>As you manage your email strategy, remember what you promised your subscribers when they signed up. Focus on promoting links that are valuable and align with their interests, as well as your brand.</p> \n<p>Because consumers don't appreciate or trust unsolicited email in their inboxes, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/32892/why-purchasing-email-lists-is-always-a-bad-idea.aspx\">we don't condone purchasing contacts from another company</a>. Not only is this <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/32892/why-purchasing-email-lists-is-always-a-bad-idea.aspx\">against GDPR mandates</a>, but it could also <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/32892/why-purchasing-email-lists-is-always-a-bad-idea.aspx\">annoy contacts, cause unsubscriptions, and hurt your IP reputation</a>.</p> \n<p>As an alternative, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/34188/what-in-the-heck-is-co-marketing.aspx\">consider co-branded emails</a>. With this strategy, you can market one brand's email subscription and content in your email while they market your email and content to their subscription list. This way, the brand's audience can choose whether or not they want to subscribe and might be less likely to remove themselves from your list after signing up.</p> \n<p>Here's a great example of a co-branded email campaign from <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/34188/what-in-the-heck-is-co-marketing.aspx\">HubSpot and Unbounce</a>. Although this doesn't directly market HubSpot or Unbounce email subscription options, it highlights great points about both companies and a project they're jointly working on which could indirectly result in both brands gaining email subscribers:</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Why%20Consumers%20Subscribe%20and%20Unsubscribe%20from%20Email%20%5BNew%20Data%5D-4.png?width=300&amp;name=Why%20Consumers%20Subscribe%20and%20Unsubscribe%20from%20Email%20%5BNew%20Data%5D-4.png\" alt=\"Unbounce comarketing promotional email\" width=\"300\" style=\"width: 300px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<h2>Tips for Winning (and Keeping) Email Subscribers</h2> \n<p>Email marketing best practices aren't always the same for every brand. That means that it will take experimentation and practice to grow and maintain your email subscriber list.</p> \n<p>Because building a list can be challenging in the beginning, it's important to not give up when one or two tactics don't work. Although you'll want to personalize your tactics to your audience, here are a few overarching tips to keep in mind as you aim to grow your list.</p> \n<h3>1. Create email tactics and content that audiences will value.</h3> \n<p>First, and most importantly, you'll want to develop and execute on an email strategy that prioritizes valuable content and avoids over-promotion.</p> \n<p>For example, you could create an email with a mix of sales, coupons, and promo codes, or focus on promoting your most engaging blog posts. Or, if you have a giant audience with a few key interests, you could segment them by creating separate marketing emails and subscriber lists.</p> \n<h3>2. Market the most valuable aspects of your brand's email.</h3> \n<p>To get people to actually see your valuable email content, you'll need to market it in order to get subscribers. When you share your email subscription form on your site or social media, point out what your emails will provide to your audience. Will they include blog content, expert tips related to your industry, or special deals? If so, clearly state this in your messaging.</p> \n<p>Here's a look at <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/subscriptions\">how we promote the HubSpot Blog's emails</a>:</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Why%20Consumers%20Subscribe%20and%20Unsubscribe%20from%20Email%20%5BNew%20Data%5D-Jul-06-2020-12-35-58-52-AM.png?width=300&amp;name=Why%20Consumers%20Subscribe%20and%20Unsubscribe%20from%20Email%20%5BNew%20Data%5D-Jul-06-2020-12-35-58-52-AM.png\" width=\"300\" style=\"width: 300px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" alt=\"HubSpot subscribe to email CTA\">\n</div> \n<h3>3. Don't just focus on just your products.</h3> \n<p>Yes. You are a marketer and shouldn't avoid talking about great product offerings when you have them. However, too many product details in an email can feel spammy or over promotional.</p> \n<p>When you promote your products in an email, try to include other content, such as links to blogs or videos to balance the email out. This will be even more important if you promoted valuable content rather than just product news when marketing your email subscription form.</p> \n<p>In our <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/state-of-marketing\">2020 State of Marketing Report</a>, EMEA marketing manager Henni Roini emphasized why product promotion isn't everything.</p> \n<p>“Only the companies and brands that create human connection are going to succeed. This is extremely true with email. You might get short term benefits from very promotional content, but honest, human, and personalized content creates a following for the long term,\" <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/state-of-marketing\">Roini said</a>.</p> \n<p>Want to learn more about email marketing?

But today, I was skeptical.</p> \n<p>A makeup company I like is releasing a skincare extension. I was on the fence, so I wanted to see what my favorite YouTubers were saying. Most of them had the same reaction: \"I don't care about the price. When it comes to this brand, I know it's gonna be great.\"</p> \n<p>They will purchase from the new line, regardless of reviews.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>This is known as brand equity. Consumers influence the public perception of businesses, building positive or negative brand equity. But let’s take a closer look.</p> \n<p>If you've ever decided against buying from a specific company based on a review from your friends, you've seen negative brand equity at work. Negative brand equity might result from poor customer service, lack of transparency, or inaccurate pricing.</p> \n<p>Think of that one product you don't mind shelling out a few extra dollars to have because you <em>know </em>you'll be satisfied. In your opinion, that business has positive brand equity. Brand equity determines value because positive brand equity can justify higher prices.</p> \n<p>Now that you know what brand equity is, you're probably thinking about how to find out your company's. To save you that time, let's talk about measuring brand equity.</p> \n<h2>How to Measure Brand Equity</h2> \n<p>Measuring brand equity involves customer knowledge, public perception, and finances. Customers are a no-brainer; Their opinion is the number one source of brand equity, but it shouldn't be the sole indicator. Let's look at a few others.</p> \n<h3>1. Focus on brand awareness.</h3> \n<p>We've gone over how important customers are to brand equity. It starts with awareness. If your audience doesn't know about your company, they won't be able to develop an opinion of it.</p> \n<p>So if you haven't already, take note of how you're handling brand awareness. How are you communicating your company's story? More importantly, how are they responding?</p> \n<p>Leverage consumer response to your brand as an action to create more brand awareness. Content offers, web traffic, and social media performance will give you the data you need to assess brand awareness.</p> \n<p>For instance, if you've found that you generate the most leads by making informative ebooks, create one about a topic that's your company's bread and butter. For a social media agency, that might be creating compelling Instagram stories.</p> \n<p>That way, when a lead sees the ad on Facebook, they'll have an idea of what your company does. The offer is an incentive for them to learn more, and the subject matter will keep them engaged.</p> \n<h3>2. Analyze your company's overall finances.</h3> \n<p>Are you currently analyzing purchase metrics? These metrics will tell you what products are popular among customers and identify shopping patterns that could influence future campaigns.</p> \n<p>Look at how your business interacts with audiences — this influences purchasing behavior. If a customer comments under an Instagram post about poor customer service, it can contribute to negative brand equity. To avoid this, make sure customer service protocol involves answering the consumer comments and concerns.</p> \n<p>If you notice sales are dipping after a few negative comments, revisit customer service protocol. It might be contributing to a lower brand equity and decrease in sales. But by studying how your business interacts with its audiences, you'll quickly identify ways to improve that messaging.</p> \n<p>Make sure you’re telling your audience why your price is worth it. Alternatively, give your audience a chance to see for themselves. In your next ad, announce a sale, boost an offer, or create a free trial.</p> \n<p>That way, your audience can give your company a test run before they commit, and you can begin to measure how this inbound marketing tactic performs among customers. If it increases brand equity, you might have a new winning strategy.</p> \n<h3>3. Identify the public perception of your brand.</h3> \n<p>So far, we've talked about why brand awareness is important to brand equity. But <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/corporate-image?_ga=2.167200702.1860695292.1595883551-940436819.1565181751\">corporate image</a> is also crucial.</p> \n<p>Ask customers to leave reviews. Product reviews are extremely powerful in cementing brand equity. A sushi restaurant with 4.5 stars on Yelp will most likely get more business than the one down the street with 3.9, even if the food is more affordable.</p> \n<p>Analyze what customers are already saying and if they'd recommend your company to a friend.</p> \n<p>At this point, you know how to measure public perception. But it's likely you've run into a problem … You have no idea <em>how</em> to build equity. Let's get the ball rolling with a few ideas.</p> \n<h3>1. Research public perception of your brand.</h3> \n<p>Customers aren't the only group that contributes to brand equity. Audiences are just as important.</p> \n<p>Approaching public perception is going to look slightly different than reaching your customers. The audience you're targeting doesn't know as much about your company as the ones purchasing from your company regularly, so NPS surveys probably won't do the trick.</p> \n<p>However, your market contributes to brand equity from an outward perspective. So, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/market-research-buyers-journey-guide\">researching</a> their opinion is going to be helpful in figuring out a few things.</p> \n<p>First, by understanding what your audience thinks of your business, you can learn why or why not people are buying your offerings. Second, you'll understand the challenges your audience is looking for companies like yours to solve. This will inform better business and marketing decisions.</p> \n<p>Public perception is essential to brand equity, but let's face it: We probably don't have the time to spend hours Googling our company to gain insight. So, what can you do to research public perception in a way that saves you time?</p> \n<p>The short answer is software. For instance, <a href=\"https://www.talkwalker.com/quick-search\">Smart Watch </a> looks at follower activity on social media channels. Then, you'll get a customized report that breaks down comments, replies, and likes to tell you a response consensus.</p> \n<p>Additionally, <a href=\"http://brandwatch.com\">Brandwatch</a> can point out where your branded images are appearing. For instance, if you upload a marketing photo into the tool, it'll crawl the web for that image and pull out results. This can help you identify the spaces where your company is the most prevalent — and what people are saying.</p> \n<p>If you're looking for a couple more resources, say, 10 more, this<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service/sentiment-analysis-tools?_ga=2.142559154.1860695292.1595883551-940436819.1565181751\"> sentiment analysis tool round-up</a> is your answer.</p> \n<h3>2. Communicate your brand beliefs in marketing.</h3> \n<p>One of the biggest ways to begin building brand equity is to emphasize branding when you execute marketing campaigns. Every visual asset you make should speak to your brand in some way.</p> \n<p>Use <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-creation?_ga=2.142559154.1860695292.1595883551-940436819.1565181751\">colors, images, and copy</a> to your benefit, and introduce a tone that makes sense to your company and audience. If you can look across all customer-facing content and recognize patterns in those three areas, you're likely communicating a strong brand message.</p> \n<p>Customers and audiences will begin to pick up on the details that define your company. For instance, when you look at this Instagram feed, you can notice similar details, imagery, and tone:</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/The%20Plain-English%20Guide%20to%20Brand%20Equity.png\" alt=\"An example of Instagram branding.\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n</div> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 11px;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'times new roman', times;\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/hubspot/\">Image Source</a></span></p> \n<p>In the image above, you can point to colors, industries, and audiences that relate to HubSpot's brand. Valuable content, like helpful statistics, make this account one to look for in terms of industry insights. As a result, a marketing professional is likely to associate this account with meaningful marketing-based content.</p> \n<p>To build a positive brand equity, speak to what's important to your company and audience.</p> \n<h3>3. Turn what customers say into action.</h3> \n<p>If you've been collecting customer stories and data, see how you can use that information to boost equity. For example, if customer reviews have been mentioning a new addition to your software, teasing its release could be a great way to earn positive reception. Customers that see they're being listened to contribute to excellent equity.</p> \n<p>It could also be a good idea to step up <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service/interaction-with-customers?_ga=2.138849331.1860695292.1595883551-940436819.1565181751\">customer interaction</a>. If your company doesn't interact with customers on social channels or email, or reach out for feedback, you probably don't know what they are expecting. Revamp how you get in touch with customers because they hold the most value when it comes to equity.</p> \n<p>Maybe there's a feature upgrade you know customers are really interested in, but you don't have the bandwidth to build. In that case, focus on improving a customer favorite, or a much-anticipated restock of a bestselling product.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/The%20Plain-English%20Guide%20to%20Brand%20Equity-1.png\" alt=\"Example of providing what the customers want to see in marketing messages.\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n</div> \n<p>This is a marketing email I got a while ago. Instead of restocking the eyeshadow collection with these shades, <a href=\"http://colourpop.com\">ColourPop</a> decided to split up the collections according to customer suggestions. This move was made to show customers that the company values their opinion — it also builds brand equity.</p> \n<h3>4. Emphasize how you're different from competitors.</h3> \n<p>Do you remember the \"Get a Mac\" campaign? If not, how about the commercials with two actors introducing themselves as either a Mac or a PC? These clips sparked the infamous 2006 debate about which computer choice was better:</p> \n<div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"width: 100%; height: auto; position: relative; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; max-width: 560px; max-height: 315px; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\"> \n <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 0;\">\n  <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jz1arPaSSqo\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n </div> \n</div> \n<p>Apple released the commercials to emphasize why iMacs were the cool, modern, powerful choice for young adults. Commercials would show a hip, relatable actor talking about the different capabilities of the computer. Then, an older, out-of-touch actor would talk about why they love their limited PC.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/heres-why-apples-steve-jobs-didnt-want-those-mac-vs-pc-ads-to-be-too-funny-2019-05-26\">The commercials were wildly successful</a> and profitable for Apple. They also established brand equity against competitors. Apple's team took the time to name computer specs in a way their audience would understand. They spoke directly to the customer about why Macs were the favorable option.</p> \n<p>To gain that market edge, use campaigns to explicitly state why your product is the best suited for your customer. Maybe it's because you offer a more streamlined way of doing things, like in the Apple commercial.</p> \n<p>Remember not to attack your competition. The goal here is to build your brand without tearing another down. Tell your customers about the features others don't offer, and use that feature to define part of your brand.</p> \n<h3>5. Keep up a helpful presence on social media.</h3> \n<p>This sounds like a no-brainer, but it's so important to actively devote yourself to excellent customer service. I can't count how many times I follow a company on Instagram because of a product, then ultimately decide against buying it because of poor communication from the brand.</p> \n<p>I've seen comments about not receiving orders, trouble cancelling memberships, and misleading products. That's a red flag, but if a company handles these comments in a negative way, that's a deal-breaker. Not only that, but it reflects poorly on my opinion on the brand, as well as other audiences'.</p> \n<p>Whether you're talking to customers in person or online, make sure you're handling concerns with urgency and care. Others take note of how you treat customers and make their own opinions based on what they see.</p> \n<p>If you want a full-guide about how to ace social media customer service, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service/social-media-customer-service?_ga=2.202147729.1860695292.1595883551-940436819.1565181751\">check out this post</a>.</p> \n<p>As a consumer, I'm still unsure about the skincare launch I mentioned earlier, but that doesn't mean I won't buy the new lip gloss that launched today. I know and trust this company with cosmetics.</p> \n<p>This company's brand equity doesn't hurt, either. If I need any more convincing, I can just look at the glowing reviews of other lip glosses on the website, on YouTube, and on Instagram. I'll also take note of how others rave about the quick shipment and product quality.</p> \n<p>Brand equity can be the make or break for your company, but after reading this post, you're ready to make it a positive one for your entire audience. Good luck, and happy branding.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fbrand-equity&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 28 Jul 2020 08:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/The%20Plain-English%20Guide%20to%20Brand%20Equity.png","linkMd5":"24817a71f0f9c1d924a85c18a81760cf","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn89@2020_6/2020-07-30/1596118301898_d69a030ac4706721.webp","author":"Kayla Carmicheal","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/The%20Plain-English%20Guide%20to%20Brand%20Equity.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn89@2020_6/2020-07-30/1596118301898_d69a030ac4706721.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/The%20Plain-English%20Guide%20to%20Brand%20Equity-1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn57@2020_6/2020-07-30/1596118309386_cbd7dfb4eb296663.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fbrand-equity&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn61@2020_6/2020-07-30/1596118304931_c886cdf450ea4aab.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-07-30 22:11:40","updatedTime":"2020-07-30 14:11:40","title":"8 Startup Marketing Ideas That Actually Work [+ Examples]","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/startup-marketing","description":"<p>Are you new to the startup game, and even newer to the content marketing game?</p> \n<p>With all the work that goes into starting a business, there's little time to think about marketing strategies that prove successful <em>and</em> are feasible for a startup's teams to execute.</p> \n<p>If you find yourself in this boat, don't panic. You probably know the tools that are helpful for startup marketers to use when strategizing — a CMS, social media accounts, and graphic design software, for instance.</p> \n<p>Now, what you need to know is how to <em>use</em> these tools, and similar methods, to create campaigns that align with your business goals. You may have seen other startups' glowing marketing techniques and found yourself wondering how to create a winning strategy.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>For that, we've got you covered. To get a sense of how a marketing strategy can produce success for your startup, we're going to lay out some ideas. These ideas are from startups, and will help you visualize how a successful strategy can be helpful for your own marketing goals.</p> \n<p>Here, let's explore startup marketing ideas and strategies you can use to increase brand awareness, leads, and customers for your startup business.</p> \n<h2>Startup Marketing Ideas</h2> \n<p>Other than starting an email list, using online software, and taking high-quality images, what else can you do to market your startup? Below are some examples.</p> \n<p>If you're struggling to come up with new marketing ideas, maybe you can put a new spin on one that works for your campaign goals. Like some of the companies mentioned, you can use tools you already have at your disposal to execute a winning campaign.</p> \n<h3>1. Use paid ads to build a community.</h3> \n<p><a href=\"http://starburstdata.com\">Starburst Data</a> is a B2B that helps companies understand their website analytics. They use a search query engine that organizes data, so customers can interpret large amounts of data quickly. This startup uses ads on LinkedIn to connect with its audience, like this one promoting their software:</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Startup%20marketing.png\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" alt=\"Starburst Data paid ads example\">\n</div> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'times new roman', times;\"><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/starburstdata/ads/\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Source</a></span></p> \n<p>A content marketer for a company like Starburst has a good chance of finding its target audience on LinkedIn, since it's a platform for professional networking. Part of this marketing campaign involves using <a href=\"https://business.linkedin.com/marketing-solutions/cx/17/06/advertise-on-linkedin?src=go-pa&amp;trk=sem_lms_gaw&amp;veh=Google_Search_NAMER_USCA_Brand-Head-Terms_Alpha_DR_AllLanguages_Restructure_378919961167__linkedin%20ads_c__kwd-12132901520_6458957165&amp;mcid=6612464045041733652&amp;cname=Google_Search_NAMER_USCA_Brand-Head-Terms_Alpha_DR_AllLanguages_Restructure&amp;camid=6458957165&amp;asid=77594803136&amp;targetid=kwd-12132901520&amp;crid=378919961167&amp;placement=&amp;dev=c&amp;ends=1&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIxqq9tZDU6AIVApSzCh3MkAn3EAAYASAAEgJVWvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds\">LinkedIn Ads</a> to build community and provide helpful information.</p> \n<p>A similar B2B startup strategy could involve making use of a social media platform's paid ads offerings to cater to your audience. Alternatively, you can upload offers for free and use hashtags to get them seen by more prospective customers, like #B2BMarketing, or #MarTech.</p> \n<h3>2. Try social media to connect with customers.</h3> \n<p>Social media marketing doesn't have to include spending money — it can be used to grow your audience and connect with existing members. Take <a href=\"http://paperlessparts.com\">Paperless Parts</a>, for example, a manufacturing company with a stellar Facebook page:</p> \n<iframe style=\"border: none; overflow: hidden; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\" src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FpaperlessPARTS%2Fvideos%2F2012071495763706%2F&amp;width=500&amp;show_text=true&amp;height=390&amp;appId\" width=\"500\" height=\"390\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n<p>It's free to create a <a href=\"https://business.facebook.com/\">Facebook Business</a> page and optimize it so leads and customers can find it. The Paperless Parts feed begins with recommendations and reviews from happy customers, showing that the business has a dedicated customer userbase. After that, the business posts videos that go behind-the-scenes of the manufacturing process, and also post reminders for webinars and other website content.</p> \n<p>A social media page for a startup that showcases customers provides helpful content and encourages audience participation is a free strategy to expand reach, bring clicks to your website, and show credibility in the industry.</p> \n<h3>3. Crowdfunding marketing, which can generate press.</h3> \n<p>Are you thinking about starting a crowdfunding campaign? If you do, you could earn great press from publications, expanding your campaign's reach. Take <a href=\"http://neighborschools.com\">NeighborSchools</a>, for example, which is a child care startup. NeighborSchools offers unique daycares from licensed and experienced professionals.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Startup%20marketing-2.png\" alt=\"NeighborSchool's website page. \" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n</div> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"http://neighborschools.com\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Source</a></p> \n<p>When the minds behind NeighborSchools began to seek funding to scale up their service, they turned to crowdfunding to seek out people who believed in the service and were able to invest. This tactic earned the company <a href=\"https://resources.neighborschools.com/blog/seed-round-funding-announcement\">$3.5 million</a> in seed funding, and the success caught the eye of <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20191105005200/en/NeighborSchools-Raises-3.5-Million-Bring-Quality-Affordable\">major publications</a>.</p> \n<p>Even if you have just a few customers, you can use your crowdfunding campaign as a marketing tactic to get more people interested in your business.</p> \n<h3>4. Host a virtual meetup instead of a conference.</h3> \n<p><a href=\"http://mabl.com\">Mabl</a> is a Boston-based SaaS provider for machine learning test automation. It makes the lives of developers who have to test their solutions way easier. To build a larger community, Mabl hosted a virtual meetup with industry experts.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Startup%20marketing-1.png\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" alt=\"Mabl's interactive webinar invite. \">\n</div> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'times new roman', times;\"><a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/ministry-of-testing-boston/events/269353803/\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Source</a></span></p> \n<p>The meetup's speakers educated its attendees about software testing. This idea is a cool, low-cost way to expand your professional network and provide valuable content for customers without hosting a conference.</p> \n<h3>5. Use user-generated content to tell your story.</h3> \n<p>Startups don't usually have the revenue to produce big-budget social media campaigns. For travel agency <a href=\"http://hopjump.com\">Hopjump</a>, their marketing team found that the best way to tell their story is on Instagram. The business page is filled with clients enjoying their destination vacations, booked using the service:</p> \n<div style=\"text-align: left;\">\n <iframe class=\"instagram-media instagram-media-rendered\" style=\"background: white; max-width: 540px; border-radius: 3px; border: 1px solid #dbdbdb; box-shadow: none; display: block; margin: 0px auto 12px; min-width: 326px; padding: 0px;\" src=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B-cbVS6Km4l/embed/captioned/?cr=1&amp;v=12&amp;wp=971&amp;rd=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.hs-sites.com&amp;rp=%2F%3FportalId%3D53%26_preview%3Dtrue%26cacheBust%3D1594144953868%26preview_key%3DPSeBKKEl%26inpageEditorUI%3Dtrue%26benderPackage%3DInpageEditorUI%26staticVersion%3Dstatic-1.22295%26scriptPath%3Dbundles%252Fapp.js%26cssPath%3Dbundles%252Fapp#%7B%22ci%22%3A1%2C%22os%22%3A15049.190000005183%2C%22ls%22%3A4600.720000002184%2C%22le%22%3A4602.624999999534%7D\" width=\"560\" height=\"1019\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>  \n <p style=\"text-align: left;\">Customers who post their amazing travel pictures on Instagram can tag Hopjump for a chance to be featured on the page, and this also increases exposure for the startup. Satisfied customers can share their experiences with more of Hopjump's target audience.</p> \n <p style=\"text-align: left;\">A marketing campaign that includes user-generated content is an easy, free way to work in testimonials. You can use your social media channels to execute the campaign and include hashtags for the chance to appear in more feeds.</p> \n <p style=\"text-align: left;\">When thinking about campaign ideas, you might not have to look that far. You might be able to turn some of the tools you already have at your disposal to boost your campaign messages. Is there a webinar you can host about a topic, or a content offer you think will resonate particularly well with your LinkedIn audience?</p> \n <h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">6. Create SEO-optimized content to attract high-intent visitors.</h3> \n <p style=\"text-align: left;\">SEO is another free, cost-effective strategy startup marketers can use to spread word about their business.</p> \n <p style=\"text-align: left;\">But here's the caveat: of all the strategies mentioned, this one takes the longest.</p> \n <p style=\"text-align: left;\">That's not to say it's incredibly time-consuming — it's not, but it <em>is</em> a continuous job. The more you optimize your website, the better it'll perform, which, in turn, will generate more leads for your company.</p> \n <p style=\"text-align: left;\">We have to let you know that at this point, SEO won't net you leads or opportunities immediately, but it will lay the foundation for consistent success in the months and years to come.</p> \n <p style=\"text-align: left;\">The idea behind <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/seo-strategy\">SEO</a> is that you optimize your web pages (and content) for keyword terms you know prospects use to find products or services like yours.</p> \n <p style=\"text-align: left;\">Better yet, you identify <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/28912/the-ultimate-guide-for-mastering-long-tail-search.aspx\">long-tail keyword</a> terms with low to medium competition and high search volume that are relevant to your product or service, and use those instead.</p> \n <p style=\"text-align: left;\">You main service pages will, of course, be competing with other businesses in your space on many similar terms, but you can use the content you create to link to these pages, bolstering their SEO value over time and increasing their ranking on SERP results pages.</p> \n <p style=\"text-align: left;\">Updating and optimizing your website will ensure it continues to grow and attract interested prospects for the long-term, so it's an opportunity you don't want to miss.</p> \n <h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">7. Implement a referral program.</h3> \n <p style=\"text-align: left;\">Referral-based marketing has become the hype over the last few years as people increasingly look at product/service reviews, testimonials, and case studies to validate their purchase decisions.</p> \n <p style=\"text-align: left;\">The aim behind this particular startup marketing idea is to leverage those who have already bought your product/service and ask them to advocate on your behalf — whether that's through a review, testimonial, or case study.</p> \n <p style=\"text-align: left;\">This kind of content is invaluable because it shows and tells your potential customers that you have solved for others like them in the past. To increase the chances of your customers doing this for you, offer them discounts or free product trials.</p> \n <p style=\"text-align: left;\">Additionally, you might consider giving away free keys, trials, or versions of your product to specific people. For example, a good way to gain press coverage and build brand awareness is to let tech journalists try your offering for free. They can then write a review and distribute it to the relevant online publications and link back to your website.</p> \n <p style=\"text-align: left;\">Lastly, make sure that you feature these reviews prominently on your website. They help build trust and authenticity, both of which are key to making sales in today's digital-first world.</p> \n <h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">8. Offer a free or trial version of your product.</h3> \n <p style=\"text-align: left;\">One of the best ways to get your startup out there is to offer some kind of version of your product/service for free — and it's worked for a lot of businesses already.</p> \n <p style=\"text-align: left;\">Canva, Dropbox, Zapier, HubSpot — all of these high-profile tech companies offer some kind of free/trial version of their product or service to let people try before they buy (or upgrade). As people use them and realize just how great these products are, they feel compelled to buy the full, \"unlimited\" version for all the bells and whistles. Great, right?</p> \n <p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202020-07-07%20at%203.57.11%20PM.png?width=1506&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202020-07-07%20at%203.57.11%20PM.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-07-07 at 3.57.11 PM\" width=\"1506\" style=\"width: 1506px;\"></p> \n <p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 11px;\"><em><a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/crm\">Image Source</a></em></p> \n <p style=\"text-align: left;\">But along with getting people to use your product — and inherently talking about how good it is as a result — it's all about lowering the customer's costs of acquisition. What a lot of businesses do with a freemium model is offer current trial users a discount on the full price of the software. This is significantly more appealing than paying the full price and can potentially convert more leads into paying customers very, very quickly.</p> \n <p style=\"text-align: left;\">Also, for those who <em>don't</em> convert to paying customers with this offer, it enables you to understand what features or parts of your service are lacking. You can ask for feedback, make the necessary changes, and then roll them out to see who bites on the full product offering.</p> \n <p style=\"text-align: left;\">For maximum effect, cross-reference what you offer against the main issues your buyer personas have in relation to technology like yours. Consider adding features to your product/service to address these problems (where possible). Maybe produce a roadmap and show people what they'll be getting. Transparency is a great way to increase users!</p> \n <p style=\"text-align: left;\">Lastly, bear in mind that this approach does come with the risk that people might not want to upgrade to the full version. That said, be as clear as you can with what users can get from the full version and highlight how valuable it can be for them. Keep your coolest features under wraps!</p> \n <h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Startup Marketing Strategy</h2> \n <p style=\"text-align: left;\">Next, let's explore various strategies (and some tips and tricks) that enable startup owners and their teams to successfully market their products and services without breaking the bank.</p> \n <p style=\"text-align: left;\">These strategies are designed to lay the foundation for future success, ensuring ongoing interest even after paid campaigns finish.</p> \n <p style=\"text-align: left;\">Take a look at these five steps you might consider implementing to create a successful, well-rounded startup marketing strategy.</p> \n <h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>1. Use SMART goals to focus on business-critical goals upfront.</strong></h3> \n <p style=\"text-align: left;\">At <a href=\"https://www.hubledigital.com/\">Huble Digital</a>, we use SMART goals. These are goals that are <strong>S</strong>pecific, <strong>M</strong>easurable, <strong>A</strong>ttainable, <strong>R</strong>elevant, and <strong>T</strong>imely. For example, a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-write-a-smart-goal-template?_ga=2.7647930.945150594.1594052559-779953426.1586203908\">SMART goal</a> could be:</p> \n <ul style=\"text-align: left;\"> \n  <li>Increase organic traffic to our website by 50% by 2021</li> \n  <li>Create 10 new sales focused blogs by September 2020</li> \n </ul> \n <p style=\"text-align: left;\">The purpose of SMART goals is to set businesses up for success. They provide a sense of direction and help to organize efforts.</p> \n <p style=\"text-align: left;\">And, while SMART goals are invaluable for any organization, they're particularly beneficial for start-ups.</p> \n <p style=\"text-align: left;\">In most start-ups, employees have to wear several hats (often due to budget constraints or lack of resources). The founder, for instance, might be responsible for strategy, product development, and even PR, while the chief technology officer (CTO) might be involved in the design of the website, marketing, <i>and</i> social media. There's just so much to do!</p> \n <p style=\"text-align: left;\">Of course, for all start-ups, the principal focus is product development (and always will be until the \"release\" stage) ... but what about all the other elements that help sustain the business' growth?</p> \n <p style=\"text-align: left;\">It's here where SMART goals can really help. Instead of trying to do everything at once, focus on the most business-critical goals, put everything you have behind them, and tackle things in a strategic way. For instance, rather than spreading your time across several initiatives (some of which may not be important right now), focus on three or four that will lay a foundation for your activities or support your current efforts.</p> \n <p style=\"text-align: left;\">If you're launching with a new product, for instance, focus on the development but also set goals like:</p> \n <ul style=\"text-align: left;\"> \n  <li>Create 10 new blogs to build awareness of the product by X date</li> \n  <li>Publish 2 new web pages to promote the new product by X date</li> \n  <li>Secure 5 placements in online media using digital PR by X date</li> \n </ul> \n <p style=\"text-align: left;\">These are just some examples, but they can undoubtedly help raise the profile of your business without costing much — the only real expenditure is time. Instead of spreading your capabilities across several initiatives, try focusing on those that will support what you're doing right now.</p> \n <p style=\"text-align: left;\">The key to sustained growth is consistency and focus, and SMART goals enable you to do just that.</p> \n <h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>2. Create detailed documents to distinguish who your target buyers are.</strong></h3> \n <p style=\"text-align: left;\">SMART goals give your marketing efforts direction and focus, sure, but who are you marketing to?</p> \n <p style=\"text-align: left;\">For your start-up's marketing efforts to bring in tangible results, those efforts need to be tailored to your ideal target audience.</p> \n <p style=\"text-align: left;\">Now you'll probably have a good understanding of who it is you want to do business with, but have you articulated that to the rest of your team or — at the very least — put together a document detailing who your <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/buyer-persona-research?_ga=2.7647930.945150594.1594052559-779953426.1586203908\">buyer personas </a>are?</p> \n <p style=\"text-align: left;\">It's here where buyer personas come in handy. Buyer personas are semi-fictional representations of your ideal customers. They're based on market research, current data, existing customers, and a few educated assumptions. Buyer personas help you to understand the drivers, business challenges, and needs of those to whom you want to market.</p> \n <p style=\"text-align: left;\">It's also important to note that buyer personas are not real people, but archetypes of them.</p> \n <p style=\"text-align: left;\">Now that we've briefly covered what buyer personas are, you might be wondering — Okay, but what makes them so valuable to my start-up? Simply put, buyer personas allow you to refine your marketing and segment your audience(s).</p> \n <blockquote> \n  <p style=\"text-align: center;\">You want and need quick wins during the product development and release stages, so why waste time (and money) casting the widest net possible when you can hone in on those most likely to buy from you?</p> \n </blockquote> \n <p style=\"text-align: left;\">Your buyer personas will provide you with a good idea of who these people are. Use that information to build marketing and PR campaigns that focus on the right people, at the right time and place of their buyer's journey.</p> \n <h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>3. Have clear, compelling messaging.</strong></h3> \n <p style=\"text-align: left;\">If you've ever seen a <a href=\"https://www.ronseal.com/the-ronseal-phrase/\">Ronseal advertisement</a>, you're likely already familiar with the following phrase: \"It does what it says on the tin.\"</p> \n <p style=\"text-align: left;\">In an age of slick, big-budget marketing campaigns and buzzwords, it falls to you to keep your messages clear and concise.</p> \n <p style=\"text-align: left;\">People don't want platitudes or jargon. They want to understand what it is your product does, and how it can help them solve their business challenges. In fact – and this may sound harsh – it's not even <i>about</i> your business, it's about how you can help your potential customers.</p> \n <p style=\"text-align: left;\">With this in mind, any <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-creation?_ga=2.217798558.945150594.1594052559-779953426.1586203908\">content that your start-up creates</a> (and this applies to all businesses of any size) needs to be created with the end user in mind. It needs to be simple, informative, and compelling.</p> \n <h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">4. Create a content marketing strategy to generate leads.</h3> \n <p style=\"text-align: left;\">Content marketing is all about producing high-quality content that answers questions your prospects and customers have, and nurturing them to a point of purchase.</p> \n <p style=\"text-align: left;\">For instance, blogs are great for increasing your website's organic traffic and awareness of your brand. Each blog should be optimized for a long-tail keyword term, as this will help to drive targeted traffic (i.e. people definitely interested in what you have to say) to your website. It's a really easy way to increase your startup's digital footprint and start building its name.</p> \n <p style=\"text-align: left;\">The content you create also helps to generate leads and demonstrate your expertise. You could, for instance, produce informative ebooks and gate them behind landing pages on your website. Visitors can then download your ebooks in exchange for their details.</p> \n <p style=\"text-align: left;\">With this approach, you know that those that <em>do</em> download your ebooks are interested in hearing from you. The ebooks you create will be particularly useful for targeting \"early adopters\", i.e. those that want to be on the cutting-edge when it comes to new technology/software.</p> \n <p style=\"text-align: left;\">Over time, as more and more content is created, your website becomes a repository for information. Providing it's all optimized for the right terms, the right people will find it time and time again.</p> \n <h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">5. Implement a digital PR strategy to increase buzz around your brand.</h3> \n <p style=\"text-align: left;\">Now if you want to get the most out of everything you do — particularly from a content creation perspective — why not amplify it with digital PR?</p> \n <p style=\"text-align: left;\">Digital PR effectively takes everything good about traditional PR: press coverage, events, outreach, thought leadership content — and does the same for the online space. Suddenly, the assets you've created for your marketing activity can be retrofitted to suit PR purposes.</p> \n <p style=\"text-align: left;\">In fact, digital PR goes one step further: the agency you work with will do their utmost to earn backlinks (editors and publications are notoriously difficult when it comes to keeping links in content) back to your website. Subsequently, those reading your content via online publications can actually <em>find</em> your business, and the content itself is already optimized for search because you've done it already.</p> \n <p style=\"text-align: left;\">All-in-all, digital PR will help to increase your startup's visibility both online and offline, helping you to get featured in key trade media relating to what you do and cause a positive stir in your industry.</p> \n <h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">The Best Strategies Use a Combination of Ideas and Tactics</h3> \n <p>If you want to get the best possible results when it comes to marketing, you need to focus on what works.</p> \n <p>While there are loads of different ways to achieve your goals, you should always focus on the most high-impact and cost-effective, and as a startup owner — I'm willing to bet you already know how important that is.</p> \n <p>The best strategies use a combination of what we've mentioned above and then analyze the performance of them to determine which ones require more or less investment. No matter what you do, remember that your marketing activities are only as good as your goals and targeting. Good luck!</p> \n <p style=\"text-align: left;\"></p> \n <p style=\"text-align: left;\"></p> \n</div>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fstartup-marketing&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 20 Jul 2020 19:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Startup%20marketing.png","linkMd5":"41c7bba50400b8168dc7706ac158cbf9","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn81@2020_2/2020-07-30/1596118301652_ef80f20acd9febb0.webp","author":"Bob Dearsley","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Startup%20marketing.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn81@2020_2/2020-07-30/1596118301652_ef80f20acd9febb0.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Startup%20marketing-2.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn1@2020_6/2020-07-30/1596118313412_82542f09fa0d8e2d.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Startup%20marketing-1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn77@2020_4/2020-07-30/1596118313284_6228f034a5aa26a9.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202020-07-07%20at%203.57.11%20PM.png?width=1506&name=Screen%20Shot%202020-07-07%20at%203.57.11%20PM.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn89@2020_6/2020-07-30/1596118305306_8f6722802431358c.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fstartup-marketing&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn89@2020_4/2020-07-30/1596118306297_fc0897055b70891c.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-07-30 22:11:40","updatedTime":"2020-07-30 14:11:40","title":"Everything You Need to Know About Starting a Podcast in 2020","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/everything-you-need-to-know-before-starting-a-podcast","description":"<p>I’ve become a morning walking companion to people I may never meet.</p>  \n<p>How is this possible? They take me along in their earbuds as they stream my podcast, <em><a href=\"https://agencymanagementinstitute.com/agency-owner-podcast/\">Build a Better Agency</a></em></p> \n<p>It’s a wonderful sign of things to come for marketers willing to venture into the podcasting universe.</p> \n<p>Once a fringe platform, podcasts are now surprisingly mainstream. According to Nielsen, <a href=\"https://www.podcastinsights.com/podcast-statistics/\">six out of 10 people</a> understand what they are, and 112 million Americans -- 40 percent of the nation’s population -- have listened to at least one. Though podcast listeners lean male, it isn’t by much: 56 percent are men, while 44 percent are women.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Podcast.jpg?width=1500&amp;name=Podcast.jpg\" alt=\"how to start a podcast\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 18px;\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=More%20on%20@HubSpot’s%20blog%20post%20here:%20https://bit.ly/strtpodcast%20pic.twitter.com/8g9b5EDr34\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em>Share this image on Twitter!</em></span></a></p> \n<p>Marketing professionals must not only be aware of these statistics, but they must also leverage them in their own campaigns. When 67 million men and women are monthly podcast consumers, it’s a niche that deserves serious contemplation. Add to that fact the amazing statistic that <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/3035954/the-surprisingly-profitable-rise-of-podcast-networks\">63 percent</a> of podcast listeners made a purchase based on something the host recommended, and you have yourself a veritable gold mine.</p> \n<p>Of course, you have to crawl, then walk, then break into a steady trot to glean the benefits.</p> \n<h2><strong>A no-nonsense primer from a podcast experimenter.</strong></h2> \n<p>In my case, I’d written blog posts, conducted webinars, and published articles in places like <em>Forbes</em> and <em>Fast Company</em> for some time. These content producers worked, but I felt a different portal would help connect with more agencies and leaders in an accessible, easy to find, on-demand format.</p> \n<p>As a longtime podcast listener myself, I recognized that the podcasting platform was the next logical step for me -- especially if I wanted to reach a narrow audience of mid-sized agency owners and leaders as an authority in my field for more than 23 years. And as a long-time professional, I hired Predictive ROI, an Agency Management Institute agency, to produce the podcast so I wouldn’t make as many rookie technical mistakes.</p> \n<p>Still, opening yourself up to podcasting is a little like breaking the lid on Pandora’s box. Until you do it, you have no idea what to expect. Still, that doesn’t mean you can’t head off issues before you go live.</p> \n<p>Expect a certain amount of learning as you go, but be ready to explore the technology before fully launching your podcast. You wouldn’t open a bakery with your very first pie, so don’t hit “publish” until you get the lay of the land and make a plan. (Being a podcast guest prior to launching your own is a smart idea, too.)</p> \n<h2><strong>Podcasting in the beginner’s circle.</strong></h2> \n<p>Even if you’ve never been in front of a mic before, you can map out the first phase of a solid podcast schedule. From there, you’ll be able to branch out.</p> \n<h3><strong>1. Create a checklist to keep yourself on task.</strong></h3> \n<p>I asked myself tons of questions repeatedly before committing to podcasting. They included everything from the niche audience I wanted to reach to whether being the host of a podcast was a short-term fad or a long-term interest. I also considered what podcast style I preferred to offer the public, including a show prep and publishing schedule.</p> \n<p>Obviously, your checklist will be individualized, but be sure it includes a section on technical elements. Setting up audio, iTunes, accounts, and interviews can be tricky if you haven’t done your homework.</p> \n<h3><strong>2. Set up your basic show format.</strong></h3> \n<p>Every interviewer prefers to run his or her podcast in a particular way. Many podcasters ask guests the same questions, but as a listener, I find that gets stale in a hurry. Sure, it’s less prep work, but it makes the host look lazy. I preferred interviewing subject matter experts but wanted to occasionally keep the door open to produce a solocast. My compromise was a 4–1 ratio of interviews to solocasts.</p> \n<p>I was reasonably confident that I could have a few questions on hand and then launch into a conversation on the fly from there. A big risk? Maybe. But I believed I could pull off a 45-minute to 60-minute conversation without a safety net.</p> \n<h3><strong>3. Leverage the heck out of your network.</strong></h3> \n<p>The first 10 episodes set the tone for any podcast launch, so make sure you line up high-profile, interesting, engaging guests who won’t be turned off if you have very few -- or no -- listeners. My friends came through in a big way for me, offering me rock stars from day one. Not only did they help publicize the podcast, but they also generously allowed me to ride on their social media coattails.</p> \n<h3><strong>4. Track your downloads.</strong></h3> \n<p>Rob Walch was one of my recent podcast guests who offered an important consideration for any podcasters: You have to stay on top of your downloads. Rob’s suggestion is to hit at least 500 downloads an episode to feel sure you’ve broken the cycle of only having people in your inner circle tune in.</p> \n<p>What’s a reasonable download number for your, quote, “success”? Only you can determine this, but it helps to keep a steady eye on the numbers. Starting to see a downward trend in listenership? Go back to square one and ask those tough questions again so you can pivot before your podcast loses traction.</p> \n<h3><strong>5. Produce great content consistently.</strong></h3> \n<p>Does everyone have a bad episode once in a while? Sure. And if you’ve planned in advance and have great content in the bag, you can simply not release it in lieu of a better one. Before you release your podcasts publicly, try to have several on hand. That way, you get the relief of a buffer zone.</p> \n<p>Don’t try to start too quickly. You can always ramp up your delivery later. With my travel schedule that sees me on no fewer than 200 planes a year, I decided to get 10 episodes in before I proved to myself I could sustain the effort. August and September 2015 were a flurry of set-up and recordings, and we opened our podcast doors -- virtually -- in October 2015. Since then, we’ve published a new episode weekly without fail.</p> \n<h3><strong>6. Prepare to become a podcast promoter.</strong></h3> \n<p>Your target personas won’t find your podcast without a little help, so promote it like your life depends on it. I utilized our company’s email list, my personal social channels, and myriad other platforms. In addition, I requested that each guest promote his or her episode.</p> \n<p>We were fortunate to get on iTunes New and Noteworthy, landing us in the top five of several of its subject-specific lists during our first month.</p> \n<h3><strong>7. Learn how to monetize your podcast.</strong></h3> \n<p>Finally, it’s important to figure out how to earn an income based on your podcasting. One way is to promote your book, workshop, or online course, creating thought leadership at the same time.</p> \n<p>If you have a narrow audience lacking depth or width and you just can’t sell advertisements or sponsorships, you can still make numbers work in your favor.</p> \n<p>Sound like hard work? It is, but it’s totally worth it if you strategize. Two years after unveiling my first episode, we have 110 five-star reviews, and episodes are downloaded in more than 125 countries.

For one, people <em>love </em>watching live videos. The content can feel more authentic and natural than it would if it had been pre-recorded — just consider how addicting <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live\">Saturday Night Live</a></em> can be, particularly if the actors <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMWodZWNPo\">make mistakes or break character</a>.</p> \n<p>Additionally, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/live-video-stats\">82% of people prefer live video</a> from a brand over standard social media posts.</p> \n<p>You might consider using Instagram's Live feature to host live Q&amp;A's with industry leaders, stream entire virtual events, or host live product tutorials from social media influencers.</p> \n<p>If you've never posted a live video on Instagram, you're in luck. Here, we'll dive into how you can go live on Instagram in five easy steps. (By the way, I'm no Instagram influencer, so please excuse the sad plant as my only willing Live video subject.)</p> \n<p></p> \n<h2><strong>How to Go Live on Instagram</strong></h2> \n<p><em>It's important to note — these instructions will only work if you're opening the Instagram app on mobile. However, if you'd prefer to create a live Instagram video from desktop, you'll need to use a third-party tool like <a href=\"https://app.loola.tv/\">Loola TV.</a></em></p> \n<p><strong>1. First, open your <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/instagram/id389801252\">Instagram app</a> on your smartphone, and click the camera icon in the top left corner. </strong></p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/step-one-instagram-live.jpg?width=462&amp;name=step-one-instagram-live.jpg\" alt=\"go-live-on-instagram\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 462px;\" width=\"462\">\n</div> \n<p><strong>2. On the bottom navigation, scroll all the way to the left until you see \"Live\". Then, click the big white circle to begin recording. (Note: You'll know you're Live when you see the pink \"Live\" button at the top of your screen, as well as the text \"We're telling your followers that you've started a live video\" at the bottom.)</strong></p> \n<p><strong><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/step-two-instagram-live-2.jpg?width=462&amp;name=step-two-instagram-live-2.jpg\" alt=\"go-live-on-instagram\" width=\"462\" style=\"width: 462px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></strong></p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/step-three-live-instagram-2.jpg?width=462&amp;name=step-three-live-instagram-2.jpg\" alt=\"go-live-on-instagram\" width=\"462\" style=\"width: 462px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<p><strong>3. When you see accounts begin appearing at the bottom of your screen, you'll know people have begun joining your live video. Feel free to send them a Wave! </strong></p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/step-four-instagram-live-1.jpg?width=462&amp;name=step-four-instagram-live-1.jpg\" alt=\"go-live-on-instagram\" width=\"462\" style=\"width: 462px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<p><strong>4. When you want to end the video, click \"End\" at the top right of your screen. When Instagram asks you, \"Are you sure you want to end your live video?\", click the red \"End Now\" button.</strong>&nbsp;</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/step-five-instagram-live-3.jpg?width=462&amp;name=step-five-instagram-live-3.jpg\" alt=\"go-live-on-instagram\" width=\"462\" style=\"width: 462px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<p><strong>5. Finally, feel free to share your live video to your IGTV, so followers can still watch the video on your Instagram account after-the-fact. Alternatively, you can download the video to share it on your website or other social media pages, or delete the video. </strong></p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/share-instagram-live.jpg?width=462&amp;name=share-instagram-live.jpg\" alt=\"go-live-on-instagram\" width=\"462\" style=\"width: 462px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<p>If you choose to share your live video to your IGTV, your followers can continue watching and re-watching whenever they're available. If you're creating an exclusive membership-only live event, you might want to skip this step, but otherwise, it's a good idea to keep the content you've created to continue boosting awareness for followers who weren't able to join live.</p> \n<p>For instance, I regularly partake in fitness trainer <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/kayleigh_guinee/\">Kayleigh Guinee's Instagram Live workout classes</a>, but there are times I'm unavailable for the live version. Fortunately, I know she saves her videos to IGTV, so I'm able to pull up the videos whenever I'm ready to watch:</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/goliveinstagram.jpg?width=462&amp;name=goliveinstagram.jpg\" alt=\"goliveinstagram\" width=\"462\" style=\"width: 462px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n</div> \n<p>Best of all, I can pause, fast-forward, or replay the live version whenever I need to. You'll know you're watching a previously live Instagram video if you see the small \"was live\" text in the top left of the screen:</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/waslivekayleigh.jpg?width=462&amp;name=waslivekayleigh.jpg\" alt=\"go-live-on-instagram\" width=\"462\" style=\"width: 462px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<p>I spoke with Kayleigh to understand why influencers choose live video over other forms of content.</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>Kayleigh told me, \"Online workouts are amazing, but&nbsp;<em>live&nbsp;</em>workouts on Instagram allow my followers to connect with me — and one another — while continuing to build a community, which is more similar to in-person fitness classes.\"</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Kayleigh added, \"We're all able to see who joins, chat with each other, and workout in real-time. There is also something about having a time set aside to join a workout that helps us all stay more accountable.\"</p> \n<p>Ultimately, if you're unsure whether Instagram live will work for your brand, you can always give it a try. It's easy, and free, so there's little to lose when experimenting — and potentially a lot to gain.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Finally, there are some great features included in Instagram's Live tool. Let's explore what those are, next.</p> \n<h2><strong>Instagram Live Features</strong></h2> \n<p>Once you're rolling with an Instagram Live, you'll see four icons at the bottom of your screen — including a question mark icon, a paper airplane, two smiley-faces, and a filter icon.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/icons-instagram-live.jpeg\" alt=\"go-live-on-instagram\">\n</div> \n<p><strong>1. The Question Mark Icon</strong> lets you share questions from your viewers. (It's important to note, you'll only be able to share questions if someone has submitted a question during your Live video.)</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/IMG_7265.png?width=462&amp;name=IMG_7265.png\" alt=\"go-live-on-instagram\" width=\"462\" style=\"width: 462px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<p><strong>2. The Paper Airplane Icon</strong> lets you send a direct message to someone about your Instagram Live video, which you might want to do if you're hoping to invite someone who hasn't yet joined your Live video to watch.</p> \n<p><strong>3. The Two Faces Icon</strong> lets you invite someone to co-host your Instagram Live. This will help spread your Live video to a bigger audience (including the co-host's followers). You might do this if you're hosting a Q&amp;A with various experts, or partnering with influencers to promote a product.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/co-host-instagram-live.jpg?width=462&amp;name=co-host-instagram-live.jpg\" alt=\"go-live-on-instagram\" width=\"462\" style=\"width: 462px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p><strong>4. The Filter Icon</strong> lets you add filters to your Instagram Live video to make them appear more polished or interesting — like this filter I added to my plant.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/instagram-live-filter-1.jpg?width=462&amp;name=instagram-live-filter-1.jpg\" alt=\"go-live-on-instagram\" width=\"462\" style=\"width: 462px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>Additionally, if you want to turn off commenting, tap the three dots in the \"Comment\" box, and click \"Turn Off Commenting\". Alternatively, you can click the three dots if you'd also like to \"Turn Off Requests to Go Live\" if you don't want other participants asking to co-host.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/turn-off-commenting.png?width=376&amp;name=turn-off-commenting.png\" alt=\"turn-off-commenting\" width=\"376\" style=\"width: 376px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>We'd also recommend hiding offensive comments to ensure followers don't post inappropriate comments during a live video. To do this, go to your Instagram<strong> Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Comments</strong>. Then, toggle on \"Hide Offensive Comments\".</p> \n<p>Additionally, you can manually filter to hide certain inappropriate words or phrases you don't want to appear during your live video. Just toggle \"Manual Filter\" and then type in the phrases you'd like hidden.</p> \n<p>And that's it! Hopefully, you'll have your own Instagram Live videos up-and-running in no time. Remember, there's no pressure to make your Live videos perfect. In fact, followers often appreciate when they can see real, authentic, behind-the-scenes footage of your brand.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>To learn more about creating top-notch live videos and get inspiration, take a look at <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/live-video-formats\">Which Types of Live Video Are People Actually Watching?

While people still value video, image, and text content, they are finding authentic connections in shared interest groups instead of in their existing personal networks.</p> \n<p>These community groups on Facebook are a major opportunity for HubSpot to provide value to our target personas around the world. This would not only help us foster connections and growth for our current, future, and potential growing audience, but it would also provide us with a unique insight into the various communities of people and their experiences today.</p> \n<p>Since then, we have launched our first Facebook Group, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/marketertomarketer/\">Marketer to Marketer</a> … because nobody knows marketing like marketers do.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h2>Why a Facebook Group, and why now?</h2> \n<p>Facebook Groups allow our audience to connect with each other and have valuable discussions. Businesses who center a Group around their brand or industry can build a community around it — making our brand and products even <em>more</em> valuable to potential customers.</p> \n<p>Groups also give us the chance to showcase our industry expertise and dedication to our members, especially since questions asked by members (and answers provided by us) are visible to others.</p> \n<p><em>And what’s better than gathering a group of people who love you and the industry in which you’re the thought leader? </em></p> \n<p>Organic reach for Facebook posts has been steadily declining. Facebook Group posts are a different story. At Facebook’s F8 conference in 2019, <a href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2019/04/f8-2019-day-1/\">Mark Zuckerberg announced</a> their plan to really focus on supporting and promoting Groups going forward. They’ve been explicit in their desire to prioritize meaningful content in people’s feeds.</p> \n<p>That being said, we wanted to take this opportunity to create a Group as they are the perfect way to spark meaningful discussions with an audience.</p> \n<h2>How We Created the HubSpot <em>Marketer to Marketer</em> Facebook Group</h2> \n<p>When building out our Facebook Group strategy, we followed a number of steps to get our team aligned and working.</p> \n<h3>1. Research</h3> \n<p>To start, we researched the <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/facebook-marketing\">value of Facebook Groups</a> and why businesses should create them. We did this to determine if this would be an opportunity for social growth and a benefit to our social audience.</p> \n<p>Determining the value of this Group — not just for our audience, but also for HubSpot — was key in helping us identify the purpose of the Group.</p> \n<p>One way we conducted this research was by gathering feedback from our audience across all social channels to see what topic they considered to be the biggest “missing link”. This was helpful because it showed us that marketing was the biggest topic in which they had an interest.</p> \n<p>We also connected with other teams internally to see how they leveraged their Facebook Groups (like <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/thehubspotacademy/\">HubSpot Academy</a>) and piece together their research. Lastly, we listed out all the potential risks of our Facebook Group. This helped us be prepared for any red flags if they were to come up.</p> \n<h3>2. Planning</h3> \n<p>Once in the planning phase, we outlined what resources were needed to create and maintain a Group. This included any header or profile images and what a daily workflow would look like for managing <em>Marketer to Marketer</em>. We also reviewed what steps we needed to take to create the Group, such as the smaller details for building it.</p> \n<p>We put together a brief that compiled all the research and best practices we learned in order to map out the launch of this Facebook Group. This included a proposed timeline, necessary resourcing, and an overview of what the Group would look like.</p> \n<p>We also crafted two months’ worth of content ideas for the Group. This content wasn’t set in stone but has helped create conversations when Group activity has lulled.</p> \n<h3>3. Reporting</h3> \n<p>In order to understand how we’d track and grow <em>Marketer to Marketer</em>, we defined how we would report on the data provided by the Group. This also helped us understand how it creates value for our audience and for HubSpot.</p> \n<p>Lastly, we used that data gathered to inform future content areas in which to expand as well as other audiences to support through Groups.</p> \n<h2>The Impact of the <em>Marketer to Marketer</em> Facebook Group</h2> \n<p>We examined the impact of <em>Marketer to Marketer</em> in a few different ways.</p> \n<p>In terms of the Facebook platform, our <em>Marketer to Marketer</em> Group hasn’t really had a significant impact on the broader HubSpot Facebook Page — the Group is probably too small to make a difference there.</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/hubspot/\">HubSpot Facebook Page</a> has almost two million followers and <em>Marketer to Marketer </em>has just over 2,000. In this case, the pool of people in our Group is simply too small to impact such a large audience.</p> \n<p>Instead, the Group gives us a more direct way to interact with a more engaged audience. The Group content gets preferential placement in followers’ news feeds, whereas our normal Page content is a different content angle — we share brand awareness content related to different areas of Marketing, Sales, <em>and</em> Customer Service. (View examples <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/hubspot/videos/194420115130650/\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/hubspot/videos/687338512092357/\">here</a>.)</p> \n<p>In short, we consider our Group followers as our VIPs.</p> \n<p>The Facebook Group also gives our members an outlet for more niched conversations, providing security and privacy to open up about any struggles, techniques, opportunities, or new information they’ve discovered about their industry.</p> \n<h2>Learnings, Discoveries, and Next Steps</h2> \n<p>Since launching the Group in March 2020, it’s been successful. Due to the depth of the conversations we’re seeing there as well as the fact that the group has become a self-sustaining community, it’s continued to grow with a higher than expected average of posts per week — while only doing organic promotion.</p> \n<p>During this tumultuous time for marketers, we’ve seen that people can use the Group as a resource to gather ideas or help from other marketers to work through their business needs. The first 90 days were specifically challenging due to national and global events, but even with the odds stacked against it, the <em>Marketer to Marketer</em> Facebook Group is still thriving with members participating in conversations and helping marketers along the way.</p> \n<p>Our learnings on Facebook Group growth have shown that it’s important to do ongoing promotion to reach an audience that could benefit from the conversations — now more than ever. From there, establish a consistent admin posting cadence with questions of the week or thought starters for marketers.</p> \n<p>We’ve established a dedicated day of the week to be “question day,” which has allowed the Group to function on its own while making our presence known and drumming up engagement. Since the Group started, it’s grown 2,000 members, and we plan to push it larger and larger for more marketers to take advantage of this outlet of community.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fhubspot-social-private-facebook-group-marketer-to-marketer&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 23 Jul 2020 11:30:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/imageedit_38_4549915027.jpg#keepProtocol","linkMd5":"3ca4af28de59e10ecba2cfc269ddbcaf","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn49@2020_6/2020-07-30/1596118303763_a41003c74545fb2d.webp","metaImg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/imageedit_38_4549915027.jpg#keepProtocol","author":"Krystal Wu","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fhubspot-social-private-facebook-group-marketer-to-marketer&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn25@2020_6/2020-07-30/1596118309179_168529202685843c.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-07-30 22:11:40","updatedTime":"2020-07-30 14:11:40","title":"9 Ways to Deal With Imposter Syndrome Before It Hinders Your Success","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/impostor-syndrome-tips","description":"<p>\"I got lucky.\"</p> \n<p>\"I don't belong here.\"</p> \n<p>\"I'm a fraud, and it's just a matter of time before everyone finds out.\"</p> \n<p>Sound familiar?</p> \n<p>Most of us have experienced feelings of doubt and unworthiness at some point in our lives.

Rather than celebrating their accomplishments, they worry that they've somehow tricked people into thinking they're good enough. As a result, they live in fear of being \"found out\" or \"exposed.\"</p> \n<p>Impostor syndrome is actually fairly common: Researchers believe that <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/margiewarrell/2014/04/03/impostor-syndrome/#15042fb0eb9d\">up to 70% of people</a> have suffered from it at one point or another. But that doesn't make it any less damaging to a person's confidence and career growth.</p> \n<p>So if you feel like you're suffering from impostor syndrome or something like it, know that there <em>are</em> ways to curb these feelings in a healthy, proactive way. Here are 11 tips to help you get started.</p> \n<h2>9 Tips for Coping With Impostor Syndrome</h2> \n<h3>1. Know the signs.</h3> \n<p>We often overlook the signs of impostor syndrome that come up in our day-to-day lives. However, recognizing these signs is the first step toward overcoming them.</p> \n<p>You might suffer from impostor syndrome if:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>You feel like you \"got lucky\" when you actually prepared well and worked hard.</li> \n <li>You find it hard to accept praise.</li> \n <li>You apologize for yourself when you didn't actually do something wrong.</li> \n <li>You hold yourself to incredibly -- sometimes impossibly -- high standards.</li> \n <li>You find the fear of failure paralyzing.</li> \n <li>You avoid expressing confidence because you think people will see it as overcompensating or obnoxious.</li> \n <li>You're convinced you're not enough.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Pay attention to your language choices, both when you're talking to other people and when you're talking to yourself -- especially when it comes to talking about work. If you find your own success or the praise others give you uncomfortable, do some reflective thinking on where those types of thoughts came from and what it means in your professional life.</p> \n<h3>2. Know you're not alone.</h3> \n<p>When you have impostor syndrome, some of the most important encouragement comes from realizing how many hugely successful people, both male and female, have built amazing careers even while regularly coping with it.</p> \n<p>Which highly accomplished people have spoken about their impostor syndrome? Here are some quotes from <em><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/26/your-money/learning-to-deal-with-the-impostor-syndrome.html?_r=0\">The New York Times</a> </em>and<em><a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/margiewarrell/2014/04/03/impostor-syndrome/#3458b1fbeb9d\"> Forbes</a>:</em></p> \n<p>\"I have written eleven books, but each time I think, 'uh oh, they’re going to find out now. I’ve run a game on everybody, and they’re going to find me out.'\" - Author, Poet &amp; Civil Rights Activist Maya Angelou:</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>All I can see is everything I’m doing wrong that is a sham and a fraud.”</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>\"All I can see is everything I’m doing wrong that is a sham and a fraud.” Actor Don Cheadle</p> \n<p>\"The beauty of the impostor syndrome is you vacillate between extreme egomania and a complete feeling of: ‘I’m a fraud! Oh God, they’re on to me! I’m a fraud!’ So you just try to ride the egomania when it comes and enjoy it, and then slide through the idea of fraud.” - Actress, Writer &amp; Producer Tina Fey, from her book <em>Bossypants</em></p> \n<h3>3. Distinguish humility and fear.</h3> \n<p>There's taking humility in your hard work and accomplishments, and then there's feeling overcome with fear because of them. Sometimes, simply being good at something can cause is to discount its value. But as <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/26/your-money/learning-to-deal-with-the-impostor-syndrome.html?_r=0\">Carl Richards wrote in a <em>New York Times </em>article</a>, \"After spending a lot of time fine-tuning our ability, isn’t it sort of the point for our skill to look and feel natural?\"</p> \n<p>It all boils down to feeling unworthy. I like how Seth Godin put it <a href=\"http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2015/10/entitlement-vs-worthiness.html\">in a blog post</a>: \"When you feel unworthy, any kind response, positive feedback or reward feels like a trick, a scam, the luck of the draw.\"</p> \n<p>But it <em>is </em>possible to feel worthy without feeling entitled, and overcoming impostor syndrome is all about finding a healthy balance between the two. Godin goes on to write, \"Humility and worthiness have nothing at all to do with defending our territory. We don't have to feel like a fraud to also be gracious, open or humble.\"</p> \n<h3>4. Let go of your inner perfectionist.</h3> \n<p>I <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/productivity-hacks-counterintuitive\">recently wrote about</a> how perfectionism, while helpful in certain contexts, can be a major roadblock for productivity. Turns out it can be a major roadblock for overcoming impostor syndrome, too.</p> \n<p>Many people who suffer from impostor syndrome are high achievers; people who set extremely high standards for themselves and are committed to doing their best and being the best.</p> \n<p>But perfectionism only feeds into your impostor syndrome. When you feel like a fraud, it's usually because you're comparing yourself to some *perfect* outcome that's either impossible or unrealistic.</p> \n<p>Not only can no one do everything perfectly, but holding yourself to that standard <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/productivity-hacks-counterintuitive\">can actually be super counterproductive</a>. At some point, you need to take a step back and ask yourself: When is good enough <em>good enough? </em></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/good-enough-content-creation-design\">Read this blog post</a> to see what a formula for \"good enough\" might look like. And if you need further encouragement, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/oliver-burkeman-s-blog/2014/may/21/everyone-is-totally-just-winging-it\">read this article from </a><em><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/oliver-burkeman-s-blog/2014/may/21/everyone-is-totally-just-winging-it\">The Guardian</a>.</em></p> \n<p>Bottom line? While striving for perfection is certainly noble, it's usually not realistic -- and often, it's counterproductive and will only make you feel more like a fraud.</p> \n<h3>5. Be kind to yourself.</h3> \n<p><span>\"Take the pressure off yourself and stop trying to be the expert on day one.\" advises HubSpot marketing manager Jennifer Stafancik. </span></p> \n<p>Impostor syndrome often manifests itself as a voice in our heads, berating us with negative messages like \"you're not smart enough\" or \"you're a fraud.\"</p> \n<p>Negative self-talk is a bad habit, and it can heavily influence our stress and anxiety levels.</p> \n<p>\"Being kind to yourself\" simply means changing the way you talk to yourself in your head by practicing <em>positive </em>self-talk. Not only can it help you become less stress and anxious, but it can also help you build the courage to do things that'll bring you greater rewards.</p> \n<p>Maria Klawe, the president of Harvey Mudd College, <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2014/03/imposter_syndrome_how_the_president_of_harvey_mudd_college_copes.html\">suffered from what she called \"impostoritis\"</a> for most of her career. While she found it hard to silence the negative thoughts completely, she practiced hard to add positive thoughts to her inner voice. \"Now I wake up most days with a voice on the left side of my head telling me what an incredible failure I am,\" she wrote. \"But the voice on the right side tells me that I can change the world -- and I try to pay more attention to it.\"</p> \n<p>First, try to catch yourself whenever you have a negative thought. Then, turn around and challenge your own claim. For example, if you find yourself thinking, \"I just got lucky,\" challenge that by thinking, \"What steps did I take and what work did I put in to get to this point?\"</p> \n<p>Then, you can answer your own question using affirmations, which are short, focused, positive statements about a goal you have. In this case, one might be as simple as, \"I worked hard – and I always work hard.\"</p> \n<p><span>\"For me, I put a lot of pressure on myself when joining HubSpot since it was a lateral move, which ended up sparking imposter syndrome -- something I honestly thought I was immune to.\" Stefancik explains. \"Once I realized there was no reason to rush and to give myself more realistic milestones the imposter syndrome symptoms started to melt away.</span></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/wired-success/201305/do-self-affirmations-work-revisit\">Psychologists have found</a> that repeating affirmations like this can improve stress and anxiety levels, perhaps because these positive statements build a bridge into your subconscious mind.</p> \n<h3>6. Track and measure your successes.</h3> \n<p>When you feel like an impostor, one of the hardest things to grasp is how much of a role you have in your own successes. You might default them to luck or others' hard work, when in fact, your own work, knowledge, and preparation had a lot to do with it.</p> \n<p>To help show yourself that you're actually doing well, keep track of your wins in a private document.</p> \n<p>There are a lot of different ways to track these successes, and the metrics you use will depend entirely on your job. If you're a blogger, you might keep track of your posts' monthly average page views and watch them go up, or compare them to the team average. You might also keep a separate tab to paste kind words people have written to you via email, Twitter, blog comments, and so on.</p> \n<p>In the same vein as keeping track of your success metrics, keep a file on your computer of wins and positive reinforcement both at work and in your personal life. One of the best things I've done is created a folder on my personal Gmail account called \"Happy,\" where I've stored everything from my college acceptance email to praise from my colleagues and bosses. Whenever I need a lift, I open that Gmail folder and scroll through them.</p> \n<p>You can create an email folder for these emails like I did, or create something like a \"swipe file\" (i.e. a digital file) on your computer or phone to store screenshots of emails, tweets, dashboard metrics ... whatever makes you feel good about your hard work and preparation.</p> \n<h3>7. Talk about it with a mentor and your manager.</h3> \n<p>No one should suffer in silence. Sharing your thoughts and experiences with someone else will make you better equipped to deal with your impostor syndrome. We recommend sharing them with both a mentor and your direct manager.</p> \n<p>Your mentor will be able to help you talk candidly about your struggles with impostor syndrome, while giving you a more objective point of view -- especially if they work on a different team or at a different company. When you share your experience with them, you might ask if they've ever felt that way, or if they know someone who has.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/mentor-tips-positive-impact\">The best mentors are forthcoming</a> about the struggles they've gone through and the mistakes they've made in their careers, and you may find that they have some helpful stories or advice for how to deal with what you're feeling.</p> \n<p>We'd also suggest that you talk with your direct manager about your experiences, too. Why? Because they're more likely to have the knowledge and tools to help you overcome your impostor syndrome in the context of your current job.</p> \n<p>For example, you might ask them to help you find a system for tracking your successes, or figure out which metrics you should measure. Knowing what they know about both you and your role, they may also help you seek out more opportunities to shine and gain visibility on your team or at your company in general.</p> \n<p>Finding a mentor or manager to talk to is a strategy that Krystal Wu, HubSpot's Social Media Community Manager highly recommends.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><span>\"I've learned the best way to deal with imposter syndrome was to find a mentor to help guide me through my career choices,\" Wu says. </span></p> \n<p><span>As an example, Wu reflects, \"I was new to my social community role and to marketing and I wanted to do my best work but I didn't know what that meant all the time.\"</span></p> \n<p><span>\"When I put myself out there to find people in roles similar to mine, attended events to learn more about my industry and learned from my mentor it helped me gain confidence in my career,\" Wu explains. \"The more confidence and education I had the more the imposter syndrome started to fade.\" </span></p> \n<p><span>\"I won't say it's completely gone -- because let's be real, I'm always learning,\" Wu admits. \"But it's not something hanging over my head all the time. It comes and goes and I know that surrounding myself with people that are more knowledgeable in my field has helped me grown.\"</span></p> \n<p>Speaking of opportunities ...</p> \n<h3>8. Say \"yes\" to new opportunities.</h3> \n<p>It's impossible to say \"yes\" to everything, especially when you're feeling stressed or spread thin. But it's all too common for people who have impostor syndrome to turn down career-making opportunities because they don't feel like they'd do a good job.</p> \n<p>When you're presented with a new opportunity, it's important to distinguish between the voice in your head saying you can't do it because you're not worthy and the one saying you can't do it because you have too much on your plate. The former is your impostor syndrome speaking.</p> \n<p>But remember: Taking on challenging new work and doing well at it can open a <em>lot </em>of doors for you. Don't let your inner impostor turn down these game-changing opportunities. They can do wonders to help you learn, grow, and advance your career.</p> \n<p>Keep Richard Branson's <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/susie-moore/success-and-motivation_b_5198200.html\">famous quote</a> in mind: \"If someone offers you an amazing opportunity and you are not sure you can do it, say yes. Then learn how to do it later.\"</p> \n<p>While it might be intimidating to take on a role you're not sure you can succeed in, know that you were asked to do it for a reason, and there's nothing wrong with learning new things and asking questions along the way.</p> \n<h3>9. Embrace the feeling, and use it.</h3> \n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">It's really hard to get rid of impostor syndrome completely -- especially if you've had it for years and years. The fact that hugely successful people like Maya Angelou and Don Cheadle feel that way after all they've accomplished is evidence that it can sometimes be a lifelong condition.</p> \n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">That's why the best angle from which to tackle your impostor syndrome isn't getting rid of it completely; it's stopping it from hindering your success.</p> \n<h2 class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Taking on Imposter Syndrome</h2> \n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">I like the way <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/26/your-money/learning-to-deal-with-the-impostor-syndrome.html?_r=0:\">Richards put it</a><i>:</i> \"We know what the feeling is called. We know others suffer from it. We know a little bit about why we feel this way. And we now know how to handle it: Invite it in and remind ourselves why it’s here and what it means.\"</p> \n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Richards says he's been invited to speak about his work and career all over the world, and yet he <em>still</em> hasn't been able to get rid of his impostor syndrome. What he has learned to do is think of it \"as a friend.\"</p> \n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Whenever he hears that negative voice in his head, he pauses for a minute, takes a deep breath, and says to himself, \"Welcome back, old friend. I'm glad you're here. Now, let's get to work.\"</p> \n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\"><em>Editor's Note: This blog post was originally published in January 2016, but was updated in March 2020 for comprehensiveness and freshness.</em></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fimpostor-syndrome-tips&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 28 Jul 2020 11:30:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/how-to-deal-with-imposter-syndrome.jpg#keepProtocol","linkMd5":"c29d0f7ed0d543016303890b05f177df","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn93@2020_6/2020-07-30/1596118303655_4af92bb033d2491d.webp","metaImg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/how-to-deal-with-imposter-syndrome.jpg#keepProtocol","author":"lkolowich@hubspot.com (Lindsay Kolowich)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Imposter%20Syndrome-2.jpg?width=1500&name=Imposter%20Syndrome-2.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn1@2020_5/2020-07-30/1596118305373_ce17976e3359e9b2.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fimpostor-syndrome-tips&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn85@2020_3/2020-07-30/1596118308822_d4fd0d91c8050535.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-07-30 22:11:40","updatedTime":"2020-07-30 14:11:40","title":"What is a 301 Redirect, and When Should You Use One?","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/7430/what-is-a-301-redirect-and-why-should-you-care.aspx","description":"<p>I moved five times in the last year. And every single time I moved, I forgot to sign up to have my mail forwarded to my new address.</p> \n<p>Mail forwarding is an important step in any moving process, as it ensures you don't lose any valuable information that's sent to you.</p> \n<p>And the same can be said for your website: If you're moving a website from one URL to another, you need to take the necessary steps to ensure your visitors get sent to the right place. In the world of tech, this is called a 301 redirect.</p> \n<p>Here, we're going to discuss what a 301 redirect is and when you need to use one, as well as how to redirect a URL in HubSpot or WordPress. Additionally, we'll explore the differences between a 301 and 302 redirect.</p> \n<p>Let's dive in.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h2><strong>What is a 301 redirect?</strong></h2> \n<p>301 is a status code which a server sends to your browser. It is one of many possible status codes, some of which you've probably heard about (including 404 - Not Found, 403 - Forbidden and, 500 - Server Error). When you visit a webpage and the server sends the page normally, the status code it attaches to that page is 200 - OK.</p> \n<p>You can think of a 301 redirect like a mail forwarder. Once you've moved a piece of content away from a specific URL, anyone who tries to visit it will receive a 404 - page not found message.</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>To improve their user journey, you can ask the server to forward visits from the old URL to a new location — the new home of your piece of content — using a 301 redirect.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Now, when you attempt to visit the old URL, the server will send back the 301 - Permanently Moved status code, and then move you on to the new location.</p> \n<p>This happens so quickly that you're usually not aware of it, and will simply find yourself on the piece of content for which you'd searched. You might notice that the URL is different from the one you clicked on, or typed in. Or you might have a browser extension such as <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redirect-path/aomidfkchockcldhbkggjokdkkebmdll?hl=en\">Ayima Redirect Path</a> which lets you know when you've been redirected.</p> \n<p>The other key role that a 301 redirect fulfills is with search engines. Having useful status codes that correctly signal where content has moved to allows search engines such as Google and Bing to keep their index up-to-date.</p> \n<p>Essentially, a 301 redirect will let search engines know:<em>\"Hey, you know that piece of content that users enjoyed clicking on from the SERPs? Well, it now lives over here, so take all that visibility you associated with this page, and transfer it over to this new URL.\"</em></p> \n<p>This is why 301 redirects are <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/seo-strategy\">important for SEO</a>.</p> \n<p>Now that we've covered that, let's dive into how you can do a 301 redirect for yourself.&nbsp;</p> \n<h2><strong>How to Do a 301 Redirect</strong></h2> \n<p>The actual process of implementing a 301 redirect varies from CMS to CMS and platform to platform. While we aren't able to discuss the specifics of every CMS platform, we can take a close look at HubSpot and WordPress. Hopefully, these instructions should help you get started regardless of the CMS you use.</p> \n<h3><strong>How to Redirect a URL in HubSpot</strong></h3> \n<p>1. To set up a redirect in <a href=\"https://www.noisylittlemonkey.com/hubspot/partner-agency\">HubSpot</a>, navigate to <strong>Settings</strong> (using the cog in the top right) &gt; <strong>Domains and URLs</strong> &gt; <strong>URL Redirects</strong>.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/How%20to%20do%20a%20301%20redirect-1.png\" title=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<p>2. From here, choose \"Add a URL redirect\". The interface looks like this:</p> \n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/How%20to%20do%20a%20301%20redirect-2.png?width=499&amp;name=How%20to%20do%20a%20301%20redirect-2.png\" title=\"\" width=\"499\" style=\"width: 499px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>We'll go over some use cases later, but for now let's look at the options here.</p> \n<h4>Standard</h4> \n<p>In most cases, you will want to implement a single page-to-page redirect. In this case, choose \"standard.\" Next, you'll want to add the Original URL and the Redirect To URL — for your old and new URLs, respectively.</p> \n<p>You can hit \"Add URL Redirect\" and the redirect will be added to HubSpot.</p> \n<p>At this stage, we would always recommend testing your redirect. First, expect to wait a few minutes for the change to apply to the server. Next, try visiting the Original URL in an incognito browser window and check that it works as you expected.</p> \n<h4>Flexible</h4> \n<p>In some cases, creating single page-to-page redirects is very inefficient. For example, if you have just moved an entire folder of content, you may have 15 pages within a subfolder that you now need to redirect. In such cases, it's a better idea to use a <em>flexible</em> redirect.</p> \n<p>You can think of a flexible redirect as a formula, or a rule. It will allow you to redirect everything within a certain folder to a different folder, while keeping the rest of the URL the same.</p> \n<p>When you select Flexible redirect, HubSpot will automatically provide you the link to the <a href=\"https://knowledge.hubspot.com/cos-general/how-do-i-set-up-a-flexible-pattern-url-mapping\">flexible URL pattern redirect help page</a>, which will give you specific guidance on how to use the syntax for this feature.</p> \n<h4>More Options</h4> \n<p>Under More Options, HubSpot offers various advanced variations on these redirect types. It will allow you to deliver a 302 Temporary Redirect instead, choose the order which HubSpot moves through the redirect rules when resolving a URL (which may change which valid rule is triggered), disable a redirect if content is present at the URL, preserve query strings, force HTTPS, and force trailing slashes on the end of all URLs.</p> \n<h3><strong>How to Redirect a URL in WordPress</strong></h3> \n<p>If you aren't a HubSpot customer, then you will need to apply 301 redirects differently. WordPress is the <a href=\"https://websitesetup.org/popular-cms/\">most popular CMS in the world</a>, so it makes sense for us to touch upon how one might go about looking at redirects in a WordPress context next.</p> \n<p>However, it's important to note that WordPress itself is very flexible. Installations of WordPress can vary wildly, and so there is no one-size-fits-all guide we can provide as was the case with the HubSpot CMS.</p> \n<p>If in doubt, you should consult your web developer when it comes to adding URL redirects.</p> \n<h4 style=\"font-weight: normal;\"><strong>1. Apply a redirect via the server itself.</strong></h4> \n<p>The best way to apply redirects from a speed and technical point of view is actually via the server itself, rather than relying on WordPress to do it. WordPress does not offer a facility to implement 301 redirects out-the-box, although there are plenty of plugins available that will give you access to this functionality.</p> \n<p>When applying 301 redirects via the server itself, this is going to vary wildly depending on the software stack your server is using. You might be using Apache, nginx, IIS or some other platform, each of which will need to be tackled differently. This may also vary depending on your hosting provider.</p> \n<p>If you do not know how to apply a redirect via the server itself, it's not something we'd recommend fiddling with as it may lead to an interruption of service for your website — instead, we'd suggest consulting with your IT team or web development partner.</p> \n<h4>2. Redirect a URL using a free WordPress plugin.</h4> \n<p>Sometimes in marketing, you must compromise that optimal solution for the solution you can actually achieve. This may be one of those cases. If for some reason you are not able to implement a redirect via your server, you can consider using a WordPress plugin.</p> \n<p>This is not the optimal method — plugins will be slower, and you are forced to rely on third-party code, so proceed at your own risk.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/How%20to%20do%20a%20301%20redirect-3.png\" title=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 11px;\"><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/search/301+redirect/\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>Each interface will be different, so you will have to consult any third-party plugin's help documentation for specific guidance.</p> \n<h2><strong>When to Use a 301 Redirect vs. a 302 Redirect</strong></h2> \n<p>In general, you should expect to use 301 redirects.</p> \n<p>However, there are a few cases when you might want to use a 302, instead, including:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>You might be using a phased website launch plan.</li> \n <li>You might be redirecting users as part of functionality where SEO does not apply, such as login gateways or e-commerce checkouts.</li> \n <li>You might be using a temporary holding page, and do not want to confuse search engines or damage your search engine rankings by signaling that you're permanently redirecting your detailed, rich content to an empty holding page.</li> \n</ul> \n<h2><strong>301 Redirect Use Cases</strong></h2> \n<p>Here are some specific cases where you will want to reach for the 301 redirect as a tool.</p> \n<h3>1. Changing a URL.</h3> \n<p>Maybe your original URL was poorly optimized, or you are re-organizing the folder structure of your website URLs.</p> \n<p>Moving a piece of content in HubSpot CMS is very simple — just change the URL on the settings tab of the content's edit page, and HubSpot will automatically add a URL redirect for you. Be sure to check that this is working before you move on.</p> \n<h3>2. Recreating a piece of content.</h3> \n<p>Sometimes, you might want to completely rebuild your old piece of content on an entirely new page — for instance, if you decide you want to use a different webpage template.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In this case, you'll want to make sure that you have implemented a simple 301 redirect from the old URL to your new one. Once this is in place, be sure to un-publish and archive the old page.</p> \n<p>If doing a lot of these, we suggest using a flexible rule or, if a flexible rule is not appropriate, using a tool such as <a href=\"https://www.screamingfrog.co.uk/seo-spider/\">Screaming Frog SEO Spider</a> in conjunction with Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel to map your redirects in bulk, and then import them into HubSpot.</p> \n<p>You can do this on the URL Redirects page using the Import button:</p> \n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/How%20to%20do%20a%20301%20redirect.png?height=292&amp;name=How%20to%20do%20a%20301%20redirect.png\" title=\"\" height=\"292\"></p> \n<p>HubSpot will provide you with a sample file to structure your redirects, and a <a href=\"https://knowledge.hubspot.com/articles/kcs_article/cos-general/how-to-bulk-upload-url-mappings-to-hubspot\">link to the bulk upload redirects help page</a>.</p> \n<h3>3. Consolidating several pieces of content.</h3> \n<p>If you have decided that you have multiple pieces of content that overlap, compete for the same keywords, or all cover the same topic, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/remove-outdated-content\">you might want to consolidate them</a>. However, you will not want to throw away the search engine visibility that these old pages might have achieved.</p> \n<p>Once you have created your new, consolidated resource, you should set up a simple 301 redirect from each of the old pages, to the single new page.</p> \n<h3>4. Migrating content from one domain to another.</h3> \n<p>If you're moving your website from one domain to another, it is vitally important that you implement page-to-page 301 redirects from your old content to your new content.</p> \n<p>This is easy if the site is moving a domain, but remaining the same in terms of structure and layout. If the content is changing or being restructured, it is still important that you make sensible redirection choices that honor your users original intent, in order to pass the visibility of each of your old pages to their new counterparts.</p> \n<p>When implementing page-to-page 301 redirects from one domain to another, you have a specific challenge to keep in-mind: your redirects must be served from the Original URL.</p> \n<p>It is useless if, for instance, you've connected HubSpot to your new domain, but not your old domain, for you to then host the 301 redirects for your old domain onto HubSpot. You will need to work with your IT partner, web development partner, and/or HubSpot partner to ensure that serving redirects from your old domain has been accounted for. We recommend that these remain in place indefinitely.</p> \n<h3>Migrating a Website During a Phased Web Launch</h3> \n<p>You may be moving your website from one domain to another as outlined above, but due to project constraints, you are using a phased launch approach. This means that you're launching the core website pages in phase one, then a second wave of pages in phase two, and so on.</p> \n<p>In this case, we recommend creating a phased redirect map. All URLs from your old domain should be accounted for, and a redirect outlined for each phase.</p> \n<p>For phase one, you will expect to implement 301 redirects for all the pages that will be accounted for on the new site. You will also add 302 redirects for all other pages, usually to the new website's homepage. This will prevent users trying to visit your old domain from receiving a 404 error, without confusing search engines by having your pages suddenly redirect to seemingly irrelevant content.</p> \n<p>As you launch each phase, you should update your redirects, replacing your 302s with 301s as the counterpart content becomes available.</p> \n<p>Once again, these redirects must be implemented such that they are served from your old domain.</p> \n<h2 style=\"font-weight: normal;\"><strong>301 Redirect Mistakes to Avoid</strong></h2> \n<p>Now that you understand the importance of the 301 redirect, we'll review common&nbsp;steps in the process to review to make sure you don't make a mistake that could adversely impact your site's <a href=\"https://academy.hubspot.com/courses/seo-training\">SEO</a>.</p> \n<h3 style=\"font-weight: normal;\"><strong>1. Setting up a 302 redirect between versions of your domains.</strong></h3> \n<p>301 redirects point the power of inbound links from one URL to another, and although it might not look like it, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com\">http://blog.hubspot.com</a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com\">blog.hubspot.com</a>&nbsp;are two different URLs. Make sure you set up a 301 redirect from all of the different iterations of your brand's domain to boost your search engine results.</p> \n<h3 style=\"font-weight: normal;\"><strong>2. Setting up a 301 redirect after creating a new page.</strong></h3> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/biggest-seo-blunders#sm.00006uybatuk9erxqe91juzya6sra\">Back in 2010</a>, Toys 'R Us purchased the toys.com domain without setting up a 301 redirect first, and their new site's SEO results plummeted because it was re-crawled by Google as a brand-new domain without inbound links from the original Toys 'R Us domain pointing to it. Be sure to set up the 301 redirect before migrating your website content so your site doesn't lose traffic in the process.</p> \n<h3 style=\"font-weight: normal;\"><strong>3. Using a 302 redirect during content migration.</strong></h3> \n<p>Unless you're temporarily migrating your website's content while updating or repairing your website, use a 301 redirect to maintain the inbound links and your search rankings while making changes to your domain.</p> \n<h3 style=\"font-weight: normal;\"><strong>4. Having redirects link to outdated content.</strong></h3> \n<p>If you don't set up redirects from the older internal links on your website (such as a link to your company blog on your homepage), you'll create a <a href=\"https://blog.metrixa.com/5-big-seo-redirect-mistakes-and-how-to-avoid-them\">bad user experience</a> for site visitors who click on these older, not-directed links. The old internal link will eventually kick over to the new domain, but it might take several seconds or show a white screen in the meantime.</p> \n<h3 style=\"font-weight: normal;\"><strong>5. Redirect a page with a different intent than the destination page.</strong></h3> \n<p>This will be a breeze with proper organization and record keeping, but make sure that you're redirecting to the correct pages. To illustrate, you wouldn't want to redirect a user looking for your homepage to your blog page.</p> \n<p>Keeping this transition smooth will contribute to SEO being accurate, and will lead to more happy visitors to your site.</p> \n<p>Whether you're thinking about overhauling all content in a site migration, or you're just refurbishing some outdated webpages, 301 redirects help. If you're planning out this new stage, think about incorporating them in your project; your SEO won't take a dive and website visitors will continue to find the helpful content they're looking for.</p> \n<h2><strong>Other Types of Redirects</strong></h2> \n<p>There are other types of redirect too, including:</p> \n<h3>1. 302 - Temporarily Moved</h3> \n<p>This functions almost identically to a 301 redirect. However in this instance, we are acknowledging that the move is temporary. For a user, this makes no practical difference, but for a search engine the message is clear — don't worry about ranking this new page, as it won't be around for long. Stick to using the old one, it will be back.</p> \n<h3><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">2. Meta Refresh, or Javascript Redirects</span></h3> \n<p><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">This is different from the previous two approaches. The page will load normally with a 200 - OK status code. Then, a script runs on the page that moves the user onto another page. </span></p> \n<p><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">There may be certain edge cases when this is the only practical option, but in general you should avoid this approach. It is not associated with SEO best practices and often can provide a confusing user experience.</span></p> \n<h3>Addressing Internal 404 Errors</h3> \n<p>Your SEO or web team might have identified some broken links on your website. In this case, it's best practice to create a 301 redirect to forward users from the broken URL through to an appropriate resource — one that is fundamentally congruent with the piece of content they were expecting to find.</p> \n<p>However, you should also look to update the offending hyperlinks to point to the new URL, as well. Having a website that relies on 301 redirects for internal navigation is not best practice.</p> \n<h3>Addressing 404 Errors Reported in Google Search Console</h3> \n<p>Sometimes, you will see Google Search Console reporting 404 pages that you don't even link to internally. So where do these come from?</p> \n<p>Google Search Console populates its \"Coverage\" section from all kinds of sources. Sometimes the URLs are simply ones that it has seen before on a previous incarnation of your website, or it might have seen an external link on some other website.</p> \n<p>Your mindset should be that if Google has seen this URL before, a user might have as well. They might have it saved as a bookmark, or have it written down in an email, or on a third party website, and they may still click on it. That being the case, you want to make sure that those users receive the optimum user experience, so you should try to create 301 redirects to push these users to an appropriate piece of content that is fundamentally congruent with the piece of content they were expecting to find.</p> \n<p>301 redirects are vitally important for maintaining a healthy website. They serve a core function in signaling to both users and search engines when your website content moves and changes, and ensure that as your web presence evolves, your user journey remains clear and logical, and your visibility in search engines is preserved from iteration to iteration.</p> \n<p>Be sure to familiarize yourself with the method of implementing redirects within your current website environment, so that you can manage this effectively.</p> \n<p><em>Editor's Note: This post was originally published in December 2010 and has been updated for accuracy and comprehensiveness.</em></p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fblog%2Ftabid%2F6307%2Fbid%2F7430%2Fwhat-is-a-301-redirect-and-why-should-you-care.aspx&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 23 Jul 2020 13:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/How%20to%20do%20a%20301%20redirect-1.png","linkMd5":"2c03338adf1b94a11b50c7fd0abf1bfa","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn77@2020_2/2020-07-30/1596118301715_6afcd9cb52116fd8.webp","author":"Jon Payne","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/How%20to%20do%20a%20301%20redirect-1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn77@2020_2/2020-07-30/1596118301715_6afcd9cb52116fd8.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/How%20to%20do%20a%20301%20redirect-2.png?width=499&name=How%20to%20do%20a%20301%20redirect-2.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn77@2020_4/2020-07-30/1596118306995_b344e67b89e1b43d.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/How%20to%20do%20a%20301%20redirect-3.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn33@2020_1/2020-07-30/1596118313443_f2d13473f1ee346e.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/How%20to%20do%20a%20301%20redirect.png?height=292&name=How%20to%20do%20a%20301%20redirect.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn29@2020_5/2020-07-30/1596118311689_68286940d0191b1a.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fblog%2Ftabid%2F6307%2Fbid%2F7430%2Fwhat-is-a-301-redirect-and-why-should-you-care.aspx&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn1@2020_1/2020-07-30/1596118308899_450fdd16a457b62f.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-07-30 22:11:40","updatedTime":"2020-07-30 14:11:40","title":"Remote Smarketing 101: How to Align Distributed Marketing and Sales Teams","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/remote-smarketing","description":"<p>To create the optimal customer experience, it's undeniably critical that your <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/tried-and-true-sales-marketing-alignment\">sales and marketing teams are well-aligned</a>.</p>  \n<p>If you don't, your prospects will suffer.</p> \n<p>For instance, imagine this: your prospect has been researching a new video conferencing tool for weeks. She's <em>finally</em> found one company she's extremely interested in — yours.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Before calling a sales rep, your prospect decides to read numerous blog posts on your website. She also downloads an ebook, watches your company's YouTube videos, and even chats in a few of your community forums.</p> \n<p>Once your marketing materials have convinced her your product could be a good fit, she decides to call one of your company's sales rep.</p> \n<p>Unfortunately, the sales rep has no background knowledge on the content with which the prospect has already interacted. The sales rep begins a generic introductory sales pitch, not realizing your prospect is <em>almost </em>ready to buy — she just has a few final questions.</p> \n<p>This results in a less-than-ideal user experience for your prospect, who won't feel valued as someone who's been interacting with your brand's content for weeks already.</p> \n<p>This isn't an ideal experience for your company's sales or marketing teams, either. If the sales rep was aware of the content with which the prospect has interacted, they'd have an easier time connecting with the prospect and understanding her needs upfront.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/sales-and-marketing\">well-aligned sales and marketing teams</a> have a <em>major</em> impact on your business' bottom line. In fact, companies with well-aligned sales and marketing teams generate <a href=\"http://www.wheelhouseadvisors.net/how-to-align-sales-marketing-to-boost-revenue-by-208-infographic/#:~:text=By%20aligning%20sales%20and%20marketing,could%20generate%20208%25%20more%20revenue.&amp;text=Organizations%20which%20align%20sales%20and,67%25%20better%20at%20closing%20deals.\">208% more revenue</a> from marketing efforts.</p> \n<p>However, if your marketing and sales teams are primarily remote or operate out of different locations, it can be even more challenging to align the teams than it would be in-person. That's where <a href=\"https://academy.hubspot.com/lessons/remote-leadership?utm_source=marketing_blog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=remote_leadership\">good remote leadership</a> comes into play.</p> \n<p>For this article, I've spoken with Debbie Farese, HubSpot's former Director of Sales Enablement and current Director of Global Web Strategy, and Matt Hambor, HubSpot's Corporate Sales Manager, to gather insights into how you might align your own distributed marketing and sales teams.</p> \n<h2><strong>3 Tips for Aligning Distributed Marketing and Sales Teams</strong></h2> \n<h3>1. Ensure your goals are aligned across distributed marketing and sales teams.</h3> \n<p>Ultimately, to align distributed marketing and sales teams, it's critical you ensure both teams have clearly identified mutually-beneficial goals.</p> \n<p>Debbie Farese told me: \"Goal alignment is the best way to ensure sales and marketing teams are aligned, no matter where they sit. For marketing, this means looking at metrics that factor in the quality of leads generated, not just the quantity. Examples are lead-to-qualified-lead rates, close rates, revenue per lead, and more.\"</p> \n<p>Farese added, \"For sales, this means committing to working the leads that marketing generates and tracking this along with success in closing deals. Examples are work rates, productivity per rep, and more.\"</p> \n<p>Ultimately, it's not enough to <em>say </em>you've aligned goals across teams. Instead, you need to prove it, with some of the metrics Farese mentions above. And, whether your team is remote or in-office, you'll want to continue to foster meetings that allow both teams to pivot if your current strategy isn't enabling the teams to work hand-in-hand effectively.</p> \n<p>For instance, let's say your sales team has identified \"inform customers of new product features\" as a major goal for the year. However, this goal hasn't been properly communicated with the marketing team.</p> \n<p>Undoubtedly, this causes friction for the prospect. A prospect might receive tons of high-quality marketing materials before speaking with a sales rep — including ebooks, blog posts, webinars, newsletters, and YouTube videos — but they'll feel caught-off guard if most marketing materials don't mention the product's new features.</p> \n<p>It makes it easier for both your sales and marketing teams to effectively perform their roles if both teams are well-aligned in a few critical goals.</p> \n<p>And, most importantly, it makes it easier on your prospects and customers if your teams are aligned. You don't want your prospects to feel like your company is disorganized, or that they're receiving disparate information from different teams within your larger organization.</p> \n<h3>2. Have your marketing team listen to sales calls or join Slack conversations.</h3> \n<p><a href=\"https://academy.hubspot.com/lessons/online-sales?utm_source=marketing_blog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=online_selling\">If your sales team is largely remote</a>, that likely means your sales reps function primarily via video or conference calls to close deals, rather than in-person customer meetings. This could make it easier to integrate marketing into the sales process, or enable marketing leaders to listen, on occasion, to prospect conversations to ensure the marketing team is delivering relevant content.</p> \n<p>For instance, Farese told me, \"Through remote work, it's easier than ever for marketing to listen in on customer and prospect calls to understand their persona even better, develop empathy for sales reps, and get an understanding for what content and messaging really resonates.\"</p> \n<p>Additionally, Matt Hambor mentioned as a leader of a remote team, it's critical you \"encourage everyone to contribute to communication via Slack, email, or text. If you hear a good idea or success story from a member of your team, encourage them to share it with the larger group.\"</p> \n<p>This concept can also help align your marketing and sales teams — for instance, you might invite members of your marketing team to your sales team's Slack channel, so they can take note of customer concerns and successes and consider using those stories as Case Studies or by highlighting the customer in a company newsletter.</p> \n<h3>3. Create both formal and informal opportunities for sales and marketing to collaborate.</h3> \n<p>Matt Hambor, who's been managing a majority remote sales team for over two years, told me a few tactics he's used to facilitate team bonding and cross collaboration. Hambor says, \"Setting clear expectations and being transparent when dealing cross-functionally is critical with any type of collaboration, but even more important when it's remote.\"</p> \n<p>You might try implementing a few cross-department virtual meetings once a month, or once a quarter. Hambor's team, for instance, meets with a HubSpot Marketing Manager once a month for a standup meeting in which both teams are able to ask questions and ensure their priorities are well-aligned.</p> \n<p>By ensuring your sales team is able to glean insight into marketing strategies and priorities, you're ensuring your sales reps have a firm understanding of your prospects' entire start-to-finish buyer's journey, so they can better meet prospects wherever, and whenever, they'd like to be met.</p> \n<p>Additionally, Hambor mentions he often hosts weekly happy hours, contests within the team, and other more casual events to facilitate team bonding. To align your sales and marketing teams, then, you might try creating a quarterly remote happy hour, trivia game, or cross-department bonding activity.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, whether your teams are remote, in-person, or a mixture of both, Hambor says it's vital as a manager that you show you care about your employees' well-being. Hambor says, \"It's important you ask how your employees are doing … and <em>actually</em> care. They could be going through things you don't have exposure to. It's important you have a genuine interest in their well-being and success. The last thing you want is your remote teammates feeling isolated and insecure reaching out and asking for help.\"</p> \n<p>Once you've implemented some strategies mentioned above, consider sending a survey to your sales and marketing teams to gather insights into other potential opportunities for cross-department collaboration and partnership. Your marketing and sales teams will thank you — and so will your prospects and customers.</p> \n<p><em>Editor's note: The post was originally written in March 2020 and has been updated for comprehensiveness.</em></p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fremote-smarketing&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 22 Jul 2020 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/remote-smarketing.jpg#keepProtocol","linkMd5":"300c61d80f3b6a0326a8b27cf193b204","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn89@2020_5/2020-07-30/1596118303664_209363e56446afca.webp","metaImg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/remote-smarketing.jpg#keepProtocol","author":"Caroline Forsey","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fremote-smarketing&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn9@2020_6/2020-07-30/1596118305731_9ceaba0dd2e77662.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-07-30 22:11:40","updatedTime":"2020-07-30 14:11:40","title":"10 Pieces of Content Your Audience Really Wants to See [New Data]","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-your-audience-actually-wants","description":"<p>Content marketing is constantly evolving, which is what we here on the HubSpot blogging team love about our jobs. It keeps things interesting. And while it’s easy to get caught up in experimenting with innovative content, it’s important that we pay close attention to how our <strong>readers</strong> are changing, too.</p> \n<p>According to <a href=\"https://research.hubspot.com/reports/the-future-of-content-marketing\">HubSpot Research</a>, 2016 marks the start of a new phase of technological development, where new innovations and consumer preferences will usher in a new way of how marketers will do business.</p> \n<p>Our research team surveyed over 1,000 internet users worldwide to learn about their preferences and behaviors when it comes to their content consumption habits. In this article, we’re diving deeper into two specific trends to discuss how marketers can prepare their content strategies to meet the needs of their readers.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/ContentTypes-1.png?width=1500&amp;name=ContentTypes-1.png\" alt=\"Content Types\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p style=\"font-size: 18px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=More%20on%20@HubSpot’s%20blog%20post%20here:%20https://bit.ly/audiencecontent%20pic.twitter.com/ftSRKbE5wd\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em>Share this image on Twitter!</em></span></a></p> \n<h2>What content types do readers want to see more of in the future?</h2> \n<p>HubSpot Research found that internet users’ behaviors are changing to reflect a growing interest in visual content. They’re also shifting where they’re reading content, choosing social media platforms over of more traditional blog and long-form outlets:</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/types_of_content-1.png?width=669&amp;name=types_of_content-1.png\" alt=\"types_of_content-1.png\" width=\"669\" title=\"types_of_content-1.png\" style=\"width: 669px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<p>It’s important to note that these survey results don’t mean that content creators should abandon mediums such as blogging or podcasting, as these content outlets will continue to provide value over time. Instead, what the above chart suggests is that marketers should develop a more diversified strategy to meet the growing demand for alternative content types such as video and social media content.</p> \n<h2>How are readers consuming content?</h2> \n<p>For content creators, it’s important to know what kind of content readers want, and also how they want to read it. HubSpot found that different types of content are more likely to retain readers’ close attention than others. Generally speaking, longer written content is more likely to be <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/examples-skimmable-content\">skimmed</a>, and content with more visual elements, such as videos and images, are more likely to be thoroughly consumed:</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/thorough_vs._skim_read.png?width=730&amp;height=383&amp;name=thorough_vs._skim_read.png\" alt=\"thorough_vs._skim_read.png\" width=\"730\" height=\"383\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<p>Now that we’ve reviewed the types of content readers want and how they want to consume them, let's take a look at some effective examples of below.</p> \n<h2>10 Pieces of Content Your Audience Actually Wants to See</h2> \n<p>Click on the categories below to check out examples of the types of content your audience is looking for:</p> \n<ol> \n <li><strong><a href=\"#videos\">Videos</a></strong></li> \n <li><strong><a href=\"#socialmedia\">Social Media</a></strong></li> \n <li><strong><a href=\"#news\">News Articles</a></strong></li> \n <li><strong><a href=\"#research\">Research Content</a></strong></li> \n <li><strong><a href=\"#games\">Online Classes/Educational Games</a></strong></li> \n</ol> \n<a></a> \n<h3>Videos</h3> \n<p>Video is and will continue to be a huge part of content marketing: <a href=\"http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/collateral/service-provider/ip-ngn-ip-next-generation-network/white_paper_c11-481360.html\">According to Cisco</a>, <a href=\"http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/collateral/service-provider/ip-ngn-ip-next-generation-network/white_paper_c11-481360.html\">80%</a> of web traffic will be video by 2019. That's a lot. And this same sentiment is reflected in <a href=\"https://research.hubspot.com/reports/the-future-of-content-marketing?_ga=1.172014307.1733063552.1465306056\">the latest report from HubSpot Research</a>, where 45% of survey respondents admitted to watching 1+ hours of video on Facebook and YouTube each week.</p> \n<p>To further illustrate this point, let's consider that users watch <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2015/11/04/facebook-video-views/\">8 billion</a> videos on Facebook and <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2016/4/28/11526294/snapchat-10-billion-daily-video-views-users-stories\">10 billion</a> videos on Snapchat per day. Today, social media platforms are becoming more about content sharing <i>and</i> discovery, so an integrated video and social media strategy will be necessary for brands seeking to compete.

If you’re producing research content at your organization, there are a few strategies you can test to get more readers looking at your work.</p> \n<p><strong>Why this works so well:</strong></p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>It uses effective data visualization. </strong><a href=\"http://www.brainrules.net/vision\">According to Brain Rules</a>, relevant images accompanied by reading or hearing information helps us remember 65% of the information days later -- when we read text alone, we only remember 10%.</li> \n <li><strong>It uses color, </strong>which is an important factor when it comes to creating visual elements: Color improves content readership, recall, and attention span by roughly <a href=\"http://www.office.xerox.com/latest/COLFS-02UA.PDF\">80%</a>.</li> \n <li><strong>Text is broken up</strong> with quickly digestible images, like the clearly captioned graphs above. This is important because research shows that readers might only read <a href=\"https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-little-do-users-read/\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\">20%</a> of an article’s text, while scanning the rest.</li> \n <li><strong>The content is actionable.</strong> Readers want to come away knowing <a href=\"http://feldmancreative.com/2016/06/make-written-content-great/\">how to apply</a> the results of findings to their own strategies.</li> \n</ul> \n<h4>8) <a href=\"http://www.nielsen.com/us/en.html\">Nielsen</a></h4> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/reports/2016/whats-in-our-food-and-on-our-minds.html\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Nielsen_Research_Content.png?width=730&amp;height=1301&amp;name=Nielsen_Research_Content.png\" alt=\"Nielsen_Research_Content.png\" width=\"730\" height=\"1301\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></a></p> \n<p>Here’s another cool graphical breakdown of research from Nielsen, which researches consumer and media behaviors around the world. They conducted detailed research about global eating habits and how they’ve evolved according to demographic and socioeconomic changes around the world, but the published results aren’t lengthy.

When we were a smaller team, I could meet one-on-one with each salesperson and talk about how we could help generate more (and better) leads ... but that wasn't scalable as we grew.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>I needed help. To learn what other marketers were doing to work efficiently with their sales teams, I scheduled meetings with several members of our field and channel marketing team.</p> \n<p>It turns out that each marketer I spoke with had great advice and processes to better work with Sales ... but none of them had the <em>same</em> advice and process.</p> \n<p>To help share the information across our team and with anyone else new to Sales and Marketing alignment, I decided to compile everyone's best practices into a blog post.</p> \n<p></p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>Sales Alignment</h2> \n<p>Before we dive into those best practices, however, let's take a second and discuss Sales alignment. Sales alignment refers to the steps your sales team takes to ensure they're aligned with Marketing. Here are a few Sales alignment strategies.</p> \n<h3>Organize Sales around buyer personas.</h3> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/buyer-persona-research\">Buyer personas</a> aren't just valuable to Marketing; they also educate Sales on who they're selling to, what they care about, and how to help them. Consider your buyer personas as you organize your sales team, create sales enablement materials, set up your <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/sales/crm-ready-sales-email-templates\">CRM email templates</a>.</p> \n<h3>Designate staff to receive and qualify leads.</h3> \n<p>One avenue through which Sales and Marketing will always be connected is through lead sharing. As Marketing generates leads through content offers and campaigns, they pass them to Sales to qualify, nurture, and convert.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Who on your Sales team accepts <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/definition-marketing-qualified-lead-mql-under-100-sr\">marketing qualified leads</a>? If you can't answer that question in five seconds flat, you need to review your Sales team structure and designate someone (if not a small team) to receive and assign these leads. If there's one place where Sales and Marketing need to be aligned, this is it.</p> \n<h3>Facilitate training between teams if needed.</h3> \n<p>Have Sales hold product demonstrations for Marketing (perhaps the same ones they give prospective customers). Alternatively, ask Sales if they have had some trouble with specific questions during their calls. Smarketing is just as much about education as it is about alignment.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>Sales and Marketing Best Practices</h2> \n<p>Here are some of the best smarketing tips and tricks that my colleagues use.</p> \n<h3>1. Meet regularly.</h3> \n<p>The best way for Sales and Marketing to stay connected is to, well, stay connected. Regular meetings are an effective way to avoid siloing these teams.</p> \n<h4>Have an onboarding smarketing meeting with every new salesperson.</h4> \n<p>In order to support Sales successfully, it is very important to share processes, resources, and best practices from the start. Use this time to get to know each other and share how Marketing will be supporting the sales team. If you have a large number of salespeople starting, hold a monthly meeting to set these expectations and field any questions new folks might have.</p> \n<h4>Attend sales weekly meetings.</h4> \n<p>Attending weekly sales meetings allows marketers to know how Sales is doing with their quota and goals, and offer support when needed. Use this time to share the upcoming campaigns, content, and offers that Marketing will be promoting that week. Also ask for content ideas and recommendations for your future offers and blog posts.</p> \n<h4>Have a monthly meeting with sales managers.</h4> \n<p>Marketing and sales managers should meet on a monthly basis to analyze results and evaluate their SLA. Important metrics to share are lead generation, MQLs, percent of leads worked, and lead-to-customer conversion rate.</p> \n<h4>Attend events together.</h4> \n<p>Whether it's an industry meetup group, happy hour in your office, or an organized conference — spend time together in a casual setting. Attending an event together provides you with a unique opportunity to get to know your Sales department outside of the traditional work environment.</p> \n<h3>2. Create a team email alias.</h3> \n<p>Have an email alias that gets sent to both Sales and Marketing teams. Use this strategically to share important information in both directions. This also allows external teams to share pertinent information with both groups.</p> \n<h3>3. Have a content creation process in place.</h3> \n<p>Your sales reps are talking with prospects all the time and know what is getting them excited about your company. The problem is that a lot of times they don't have time to write down this feedback. How can you help? Make sure to put together a process to gather this input.</p> \n<h4>Hold brainstorm sessions at weekly meetings.</h4> \n<p>Have a five-minute brainstorm session at a sales meeting to ask what content they would like to have to share with prospects or attract more leads.</p> \n<h4>Use a shared Google document to collect ideas and references.</h4> \n<p>Have a shared Google spreadsheet where Sales can add ideas or certain references for content creation.</p> \n<h3>4. Coordinate your content marketing campaigns with Sales.</h3> \n<p>Marketers are constantly promoting new offers and content, so it's important to keep the sales team up-to-date with these promotions so they know what recent offer their leads are receiving.</p> \n<p>Here are the basic steps for coordinating your offers with Sales:</p> \n<h4>Include your promotion on a shared calendar.</h4> \n<p>Build a Google Calendar and add the date and time of your promotion (it might be an email, webinar, or social media campaign) along with the URL, the main talking points, and description of each offer. Make sure to invite your sales team to this calendar so they can see it on their personal accounts.</p> \n<h4>Email the offer to Sales.</h4> \n<p>Once your offer has been promoted and you start getting leads, you should email the sales team with the following information:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Offer talking points. </strong>Include two to three bullets about the offer. Assume the salesperson hasn't read the offer — what main concepts should they know when talking to prospects? Good talking points usually include: stats, business use cases, or \"how to\" advice.</li> \n <li><strong>Lead views. </strong>Make sure to include the list of the leads your offer is generating so Sales can take action. If you have <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/crm?utm_campaign=Marketing-Blog-CTA&amp;utm_source=Marketing-blog&amp;utm_medium=Blog&amp;spc-source=blog\">a CRM,</a> you can easily generate views and share them with your sales team.</li> \n <li><strong>A quote of the week. </strong>Similar to the talking points, including a more general quote that Sales can use on their calls can keep the conversations up-to-date. The best quotes are the ones that are data-driven and relevant, so try to include a recent industry trend or stat.</li> \n</ul> \n<h4>Build follow-up email templates for your promotions.</h4> \n<p>Offers are a great way to generate new leads <em>and</em> re-engage old leads. Build <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/sales-email-templates-from-hubspot-reps\">email templates for your sales team</a> to start a conversation. This email should be specific about the offer and how your company might help with the prospect's interest.</p> \n<h3>5. Set shared goals — together.</h3> \n<p>Historically, Sales and Marketing function with different key performance indicators (KPIs) and, therefore, different goals. Most goals are separate — Sales may be focused on monthly revenue while Marketing hones in on website traffic.</p> \n<p>A good smarketing strategy prioritizes shared goals, too. There are a few KPIs — like conversion rate and lead value — that both teams can measure and influence. Identify these KPIs for your sales and marketing teams can work towards.</p> \n<h3>6. Share your reporting and analysis.</h3> \n<p>What do your sales and marketing teams track and measure? What do they learn from their analysis? Just as you keep your communication and ideation channels open between Marketing and Sales, make sure each team shares their learnings, too. You never know what your salespeople and marketers could learn from seemingly unrelated KPIs and analyses.</p> \n<h3>7. Help showcase your salesperson's expertise.</h3> \n<p>Marketing is responsible for promoting all aspects of your company, including your products, brand, and salespeople&nbsp; — the folks your prospective customers will connect with and, hopefully, trust. Leverage your marketing resources to showcase your sales team's expertise.</p> \n<h4>Ghostwrite a blog post under your salesperson's name.</h4> \n<p>Consider <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ghostwriting-tips\">ghostwriting a post</a> under your salesperson's name. Interview them on the topic, transcribe your conversation, and turn that into a blog post. This can help the salesperson establish credibility and familiarity with their leads.</p> \n<h4>Get them to use social media.</h4> \n<p>If your salesperson is active on social media, then encourage them to share your company's content. You can even write some lazy social media messages for them, so all they have to do is copy and paste them on their favorite networks.</p> \n<h3>8. Shadow sales calls.</h3> \n<p>Also, take some time to sit next to your sales team and listen to their calls. This is a great learning experience that will help you step into your sales team's shoes and see how they illustrate the business use of your product or service. You can also get ideas for future content creation and how to build some of the follow-up emails of your offers.</p> \n<h3>9. Organize sales enablement resources in one easy-to-access location.</h3> \n<p>Marketers work hard to create <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/sales-enablement\">sales enablement</a> resources such as brochures, company overviews, and presentations, but all that hard work goes to waste if your sales team can't find (and use) them.</p> \n<p>So try to keep all your sales enablement resources in one shared place where Sales can easily access them. This location is a great place to also host your campaign calendar, links to relevant offers, and specific content for a market or persona.</p> \n<h3>10. Have fun and get to know each other.</h3> \n<p>Finally, some of the most important advice is to try to get to know each other as people. Organize lunches, outings, and celebrations, and just have fun. This helps build trust among team members and ensures that people feel comfortable leaning on each other for support.</p> \n<p>Need help coming up with an outing idea? <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/creative-team-outing-ideas#sm.0001ralmokx9oe96wpl15ahh67v4e\">Check out this list of 17 fun ideas</a> — from improv workshops to karaoke.</p> \n<h2>Sales + Marketing = Smarketing</h2> \n<p>Aligning your sales and marketing team helps both teams reach their goals <em>and</em> boost company revenue.

Additionally, while millennials and past generations were more loyal to brands, Gen Z is <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/gen-z-shopping-habits-kill-brands-2019-7\">more interested in buying products that will give them the best value</a> based on their price.</p> \n<h2>Why is Gen Z so budget-conscious?</h2> \n<p>Why is Gen Z so conscientious about their spending habits? Mounting research suggests that the age groups' thoughts on money link directly to the economic era they were raised in.</p> \n<p>While millennials grew up in more stable financial times, most of <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/millennials-vs-gen-z\">Gen Z's earliest memories took place during the U.S. recession</a>. Much of this generation grew up in highly budgeted households or saw how their families were impacted by economic troubles.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, a large percentage of millennials, as well as those in other age groups. are able to recollect times where their economy was booming. Organizations including the Pew Research Center say these eras have psychologically molded how each generation thinks differently about money. While researchers believe both millennials and Gen Z are money conscious, with goals of avoiding financial instability, millennials are considered to be \"more optimistic\" future finances.</p> \n<p>As Gen Z ages, studies and purchasing behaviors hint that they haven't been able to shake their concerns of financial instability. Much research shows that to get Gen Z to invest in a product or service, the offering needs to be so valuable to them that they can justify purchasing it.</p> \n<p>In recent years, data about Gen Z's purchasing habits have concerned many brands and marketers, especially those that rely on frills and brand loyalty to sell their products. Many have also asked, \"If Gen Z is focused on saving money, what will they actually buy?\"</p> \n<p>Luckily, there's plenty of data that reveals which products are most valuable to Gen Z. This data can help marketers learn more about Gen Z's purchasing motives and execute on campaigns that better acknowledge how their products can be valuable to those in the age group.</p> \n<p>To help brands market to Gen Z when they reach full purchasing power, here’s a list of five items, services, or product categories you can expect them to invest in.</p> \n<h2>5 Things Gen Z Will Spend Money On</h2> \n<h3>1. Gen Z will spend money on education.</h3> \n<p>While millennials are <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/millennials-vs-gen-z\">one of the most highly educated age groups</a>, Gen Z is on track to have the <a href=\"https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2018/11/15/early-benchmarks-show-post-millennials-on-track-to-be-most-diverse-best-educated-generation-yet/\">best level of education</a>. At this point, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/millennials-vs-gen-z\">Gen Z's already been shown</a> to start saving for college at a much younger age than millennials.</p> \n<p>As members of the generation enroll in college or begin to spend their own money, news outlets have <a href=\"https://www.retaildive.com/news/back-to-school-spending-expected-to-reach-record-highs/559137/\">predicted and reported</a> bursts in school-related purchases fueled by Gen Z shoppers.</p> \n<p>Aside from purchasing supplies, Gen Z is also likely to invest in courses or educational programs that will advance their future earnings. In fact, while <a href=\"https://learning.linkedin.com/blog/learning-thought-leadership/gen-z-is-shaping-a-new-era-of-learning--heres-what-you-should-kn\">62% of Gen Z</a> will take classes or learn new skills if it makes them better at their job, <a href=\"https://learning.linkedin.com/blog/learning-thought-leadership/gen-z-is-shaping-a-new-era-of-learning--heres-what-you-should-kn\">59% will do the same</a> if it will boost their salary.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/5%20Things%20Gen%20Z%20Will%20Spend%20Money%20On%20&amp;%20Why%20Marketers%20Need%20to%20Care.png?width=600&amp;name=5%20Things%20Gen%20Z%20Will%20Spend%20Money%20On%20&amp;%20Why%20Marketers%20Need%20to%20Care.png\" alt=\"Why gen Z will learn new skills\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<p style=\"font-size: 10px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://learning.linkedin.com/blog/learning-thought-leadership/gen-z-is-shaping-a-new-era-of-learning--heres-what-you-should-kn\" style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>In fact, due to the rising costs of college, most of Gen Z has deprioritized non-essential purchases just to <a href=\"https://learn.joinhandshake.com/our-team/gen-z-pragmatism-about-the-coming-job-market-debt/\">save money for academic investments</a>.</p> \n<p>Gen Z's interest in saving money and frugal purchasing behaviors aren't that shocking. <a href=\"https://learn.joinhandshake.com/our-team/gen-z-pragmatism-about-the-coming-job-market-debt/\">One recent study</a> projects that three-quarters of Gen Z will have student loans at graduation. More than <a href=\"https://learn.joinhandshake.com/our-team/gen-z-pragmatism-about-the-coming-job-market-debt/\">60% of the age group</a> is also expected to have college debt beyond $25,000.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, many researchers believe that Gen Z's interest in academia is rooted in <a href=\"https://learn.joinhandshake.com/our-team/gen-z-pragmatism-about-the-coming-job-market-debt/\">their need for financial stability</a>. Many in the age group believe that a <a href=\"https://learning.linkedin.com/blog/learning-thought-leadership/gen-z-is-shaping-a-new-era-of-learning--heres-what-you-should-kn\">good education will lead to a great job with high pay</a>.</p> \n<p>As a marketer, it's important to keep Gen Z's budgeting and educational goals in mind. This generation wants to learn new things, is saving for college, and prioritizes investments that better their future. You'll need to convince them that your product is worth buying -- even when they're putting most of their money into a college fund.</p> \n<p>As you create your product promotions or campaigns, consider how your product could help or benefit the experiences of someone planning for college, college students, or young professionals.</p> \n<p>If your product isn't specifically geared towards education, your campaigns could zone in on how it could improve a college or work-life experience. For example, if you're marketing furniture, you could create a promotion that highlights products that would fit in an apartment or dorm room. Or, if you market a clothing company, you could highlight clothing items that could be worn in a job interview in a blog post on your website.</p> \n<p>Aside from creating content that directly links your product to career interests or academics, you can also lean into Gen Z's need to learn new things by developing educational content that teaches audiences about your industry. After viewing your educational content, audiences might want to learn more about your product and develop a stronger sense of trust for your brand. Later, if they're interested in buying a product related to your brand's industry, they might consider your brand first.</p> \n<p>If you want to leverage educational content, keep the age range of your audience in mind. While younger members of Gen Z might be primarily interested in B2C brand content due to their college or high-school age, Gen Zers entering internships or the workforce might value educational B2B content that can show them how to get ahead in their industry.</p> \n<h3>2. Gen Z will splurge on experiences.</h3> \n<p>Despite being linked to heavy social media use, researchers say most of Gen Z <a href=\"https://www.campaignlive.com/article/report-gen-z-chooses-spend-hours-away-social-media/1585629\">likes to take breaks from social media and screens from time to time</a>.</p> \n<p>In a recent study, <a href=\"https://www.campaignlive.com/article/report-gen-z-chooses-spend-hours-away-social-media/1585629\">95% of Gen Z participants under 24</a> admitted to feeling stressed \"somewhat often\" or \"very often.\" Participants then pointed to online activity, homework, and finances as triggers that have caused physical or emotional signs of stress.</p> \n<p>To ease stress, <a href=\"https://www.campaignlive.com/article/report-gen-z-chooses-spend-hours-away-social-media/1585629\">many participants of the study</a> said they took breaks from screen time, read books, or left their home to find in-person experiences.</p> \n<p>According to <a href=\"https://forbusiness.snapchat.com/blog/the-youth-of-the-nations-global-trends-among-gen-z\">Snap Inc. and GlobalWebIndex</a>, Gen Z is actually more intrigued by experiences than millennials. For example, Gen Z is more likely to <a href=\"https://forbusiness.snapchat.com/blog/the-youth-of-the-nations-global-trends-among-gen-z\">view local art and try out adventure or extreme sports activities</a> than millennials. Below are just a few of Gen Z's top overall interests, according to the study:</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/5%20Things%20Gen%20Z%20Will%20Spend%20Money%20On%20&amp;%20Why%20Marketers%20Need%20to%20Care-1.png?width=600&amp;name=5%20Things%20Gen%20Z%20Will%20Spend%20Money%20On%20&amp;%20Why%20Marketers%20Need%20to%20Care-1.png\" alt=\"Gen Z's top five interests\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<p style=\"font-size: 10px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://forbusiness.snapchat.com/blog/the-youth-of-the-nations-global-trends-among-gen-z\" style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>While Gen Z values products and services that will benefit their future and help them navigate major pain points, they also still like to budget time and money for experiences <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/d3kd7q/we-asked-gen-z-about-their-spending-habits\">such as dining out, local excursions, or occasional travel</a>.</p> \n<p>Although Gen Z will invest in something that will offer them positive life experience, you should still keep the age group's budget conscientiousness in mind if you're marketing something to them. Because they care about cost and value, Gen Z members <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/millennials-vs-gen-z\">might heavily research</a> a restaurant, excursion, or travel service before spending money on it.</p> \n<p>If you're a brand that sells excursion or in-person experiences, simply placing a few colorful stock photos on your website might not pull in Gen Z. You might have to take a step further by including detailed information about your offerings, highlighting <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/happy-customers-marketing-opportunity\">positive reviews</a>, and even <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/blog-strategy-guide\">launching a blog</a> that provides more information and demonstrates your credibility.</p> \n<p>If your brand sells physical items rather than excursions, consider creating messaging that highlights how your products can improve or boost an experience.</p> \n<p>For example, if you sell coffee, you could create an ad showing a tired young adult energizing themselves with a sip of coffee before a day of adventuring in the wilderness. Or, if you sell clothing, your ads could highlight how they're perfect for outings like vacations or nice dinners out. Regardless of the product, tell a story about an experience Gen Z is interested in and then explain how your product can help them.</p> \n<h3 style=\"font-weight: normal;\">3. Gen Z prioritizes essential products, services, and utilities.</h3> \n<p>Like millennials, life experiences and education matter to Gen Z. However, as a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/happy-customers-marketing-opportunitygeneration\">frugal </a><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/happy-customers-marketing-opportunitygeneration\">generation</a>, the age group still wants to make sure they have enough money for essential products such as food, health products, and home supplies.</p> \n<p>Putting essential budgeting first was a clear theme that <a href=\"https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.vice.com/amp/en_us/article/d3kd7q/we-asked-gen-z-about-their-spending-habits\">Vice</a> discovered when its journalists interviewed a handful of Gen Z members about their lifestyle and purchasing habits. <a href=\"https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.vice.com/amp/en_us/article/d3kd7q/we-asked-gen-z-about-their-spending-habits\">Almost all of the participants</a> explained that they would invest more in essential products rather than buying products related to fun, entertainment, fashion, or fan loyalty.</p> \n<p>If your brand sells essential products, like food, cleaning supplies, or medication, there are two things you'll want to do.</p> \n<p>First, create marketing content that acknowledges and reminds Gen Z audiences of why your products are so essential and worth budgeting for.</p> \n<p>Second, keep in mind that even if your products are essential, Gen Zers might still research them, read the box before making a purchase, or compare them to other items in the same aisle. Because many brands make essential products, you'll want to create messaging that notes why your product is more effective or a better bargain than all the other versions of it out there.</p> \n<p>If your brand doesn't sell an essential product, it's even more important to create marketing materials that establish a need for your product, how it can help customers solve for daily pain points, and why it's worth a Gen Z member's hard-earned money. Remember that Gen Z's first purchasing priority might not be your product, then think of ways you can still grab their attention anyways.</p> \n<p>Not sure how to establish a sense of need when your product isn't essential? Below is an example of content from InfoArmor, an information security service owned by Allstate. In <a href=\"https://twitter.com/InfoArmor/status/1249763745435435009\">the recent tweet</a>, InfoArmor shared a blog post about the dangers of information security when working remotely and how InfoArmor could protect remote employee information.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/5%20Things%20Gen%20Z%20Will%20Spend%20Money%20On%20&amp;%20Why%20Marketers%20Need%20to%20Care-2.png?width=600&amp;name=5%20Things%20Gen%20Z%20Will%20Spend%20Money%20On%20&amp;%20Why%20Marketers%20Need%20to%20Care-2.png\" alt=\"infoarmor tweet designating why people need to. purchase a product\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<p>When reading the tweet or the blog post attached to it, a person in Gen Z or any age group might identify where they might run into information security risks and might consider purchasing the product to keep their information safe.</p> \n<p>On average, <a href=\"https://forbusiness.snapchat.com/blog/the-youth-of-the-nations-global-trends-among-gen-z\">Gen Z spends more than four hours per day</a> online, which trumps past generations -- <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/millennials-vs-gen-z\">including millennials</a>. As the most hyper-connected generation that's existed so far, it's not shocking to think that Gen Z will spend money on technology. However, because they're financially conscious, many in the age group will prioritize buying the most essential or useful technologies. For example, nearly <a href=\"https://forbusiness.snapchat.com/blog/the-youth-of-the-nations-global-trends-among-gen-z\">100% of Gen Z own a smartphone, 70% own a computer, and 30% own a tablet</a>.</p> \n<h3>Gen Z will invest in technology.</h3> \n<p>Aside from technological essentials, Gen Z will occasionally splurge on technological experiences that help them have fun, such as video games. In fact, a 2019 study found that <a href=\"https://teamwhistle.com/\">two-thirds of Gen Z men</a> say gaming is a \"core component\" of who they are.</p> \n<p>While you might worry that Gen Z isn't worth marketing to because they won't splurge on your products, this age group certainly can be persuaded to make larger purchases that offer fun experiences or improve their daily lives.</p> \n<p>But, even though they will invest in higher-priced products, Gen Z will still need thorough convincing before pulling out their wallets. As noted above, it's incredibly important for brands targeting Gen Z to create content that demonstrates why the age group needs their product, how the product could solve daily boredom or woes, and why it's better than a competitor's.</p> \n<p>For example, although some consumers might consider <a href=\"https://www.fitbit.com/us/home\">Fitbit fitness trackers</a> frivolous, this brand does a great job of explaining why their product can be a necessary tool to use within a fitness routine.</p> \n<p>On social media, Fitbit gives facts about why walking and cardio -- two activities the bracelet can track -- are important to health. And, <a href=\"https://blog.fitbit.com/fitbit-premium-wellness-report/?utm_source=TWITTER&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=USA+-+CA_64280_2961885792_20200130171400_Educate_Product+News+%26+Updates&amp;linkId=79296620\">in a November blog post</a>, Fitbit more deeply connected its product to health needs by discussing how its reporting software could help people communicate better with their doctors.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>While Fitbit doesn't claim its product is necessary for health, the brand shows audiences how the product can be used to help them track their fitness needs and progress.</p> \n<p>When a pessimistic or budget-conscious Gen-Z member researches Fitbit, they might find its content informative and helpful. From there, if they're interested in a healthier lifestyle, they might realize that Fitbit is a credible brand that could help them with their fitness needs.</p> \n<h3>Gen Z prefers to buy low-priced clothing.</h3> \n<p>A recent <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/gen-z-shopping-habits-kill-brands-2019-7\">Business Insider</a> report revealed that Gen Z isn't easily persuaded by a logo when it comes to clothing. In fact, unlike other generations, brand loyalty is <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/gen-z-shopping-habits-kill-brands-2019-7\">one of the last things they think about</a> when making a purchasing decision. What the generation does focus on is price and value.</p> \n<p>In the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/gen-z-shopping-habits-kill-brands-2019-7\">Business Insider report</a>, a 20-year-old named Amanda Chermin explained, \"I can't afford nicer brands of clothes -- I like to save and would rather have money in the bank than be broke.\"</p> \n<p>Instead of splurging on the hottest brand from New York Fashion Week, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/gen-z-shopping-habits-kill-brands-2019-7\">the age group</a>, which also prefers to shop in stores, is more likely to purchase cheaper clothing that's either not from a name brand, on clearance, or re-sold.</p> \n<p>Although they aren't loyal to the same stores and brands <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/gen-z-shopping-habits-kill-brands-2019-7\">millennials zoned in on</a>, Gen Z still feels pressure to buy and wear clothing that's considered good quality or fashionable. Aside from purchasing affordable clothing, the need to look their best has also led to many in Gen Z to invest <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/gen-z-shopping-habits-kill-brands-2019-7\">in clothing rental services</a> or <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/try-before-you-buy\">try-before-you-buy shopping experiences</a>.</p> \n<p>Although Gen Z is expected to spend <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/gen-z-shopping-habits-kill-brands-2019-7\">less money on clothing than other generations</a>, researchers believe they still feel pressure to look good in front of their peers. These pressures, which might stem from <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/gen-z-shopping-habits-kill-brands-2019-7\">social media, school, work, or social environments</a> will still drive the age group to clothing stores or ecommerce sites. While retail marketers should expect shifts in spending behaviors from this generation, Gen Z will still buy clothing that <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/gen-z-shopping-habits-kill-brands-2019-7\">looks good on them, is good quality, and has an affordable price</a>.</p> \n<p>The themes related to clothing purchases are important to keep in mind -- even if you aren't marketing clothing products. As we've established, Gen Zers are always looking for a good bargain and won't use just a brand name to justify a purchase. Regardless of how popular or well-known your brand is, you'll still need to highlight why your products are better than cheaper versions from competitors.</p> \n<p>Although your logo might not persuade Gen Z to buy your product, you can still use authentic brand trust and popularity to your advantage. Although Gen Z is budget-conscious, they also care about what their peers think of them. This means that they might still feel a need to splurge on a product, such as a clothing item, if they know that people in their age group have it.</p> \n<p>If you're marketing to Gen Z, consider asking popular influencers or happy young adult customers to discuss your product on social media. An authentic product review will not only build a sense of brand trust, but it will also show Gen Z audiences that the product is popular and being used by people they follow. From there, a Gen Z member might research or purchase a product simply because it's more popular or has better reviews than a cheaper alternative.</p> \n<h1>How to Market to a Money-Conscious Generation</h1> \n<p>Based on research noted above, Gen Z is less likely to splurge on frivolous products or brand names. As a marketer, hearing about these mounting studies might make you nervous.</p> \n<p>But, in the long run, the consumer trend of putting value first shouldn't scare or shock you. In fact, it should motivate you to ask, “How can I provide better value to my customers?”</p> \n<p>Although Gen Z might seem more budget-conscious, this doesn’t mean they won’t buy anything from you at all. In fact, many of your most frugal prospects will still buy, invest in, or splurge on your brand's offerings if they seem valuable, help them solve pain points, or provide a positive, memorable experience.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, bettering your brand, focusing on the customer experience, and promoting positive company reviews will go a long way with Gen Z and all other audiences.</p> \n<p>Interested in learning more about Gen Z?

Desktops follow behind with a <a href=\"https://gs.statcounter.com/platform-market-share/desktop-mobile-tablet\">little over 45%</a> of total internet activity, and tablets make up the rest.</p> \n<p>Today, with so many people surfing the web from their phones, it's essential to offer a great mobile website experience. Without it, you can't cater to the majority of internet users, and are likely missing out on traffic and leads for your business as a result.</p> \n<p>So how do you create an effective mobile experience? That's where responsive design comes in.</p> \n<blockquote>\n Simply put, responsive web design is the method of designing web pages that appear in their optimized form across all devices.\n</blockquote> \n<p>In other words, a responsive design will automatically reformat your website for all screen sizes. This allows your website visitors to easily view and interact with your site no matter what device they're using.</p> \n<p>Here, let's explore how responsive design works, and take a look at some examples to inspire your own responsive web design in 2020.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h2><strong>How does responsive design work?</strong></h2> \n<p>A website developed with responsiveness in-mind adjusts to the size of the device and browser to display the content appropriately. Breakpoints are set up to target ranges that define specific displays. For example, you generally see breakpoints for phones, tablets, and desktops.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Why%20You%20Need%20a%20Responsive%20Web%20Design%20and%20How%20to%20Do%20it%20%5Bwith%20examples%5D-1.png\" alt=\"\">\n</div> \n<p>There are a number of <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/responsive-web-design\">responsive web design best practices</a> to follow:</p> \n<ol type=\"1\"> \n <li><strong>Buttons</strong>: A person's finger is much larger than the pointer on a computer screen. Buttons and hyperlinks should be at least 48 pixels wide and 48 pixels tall to ensure all users can click them.</li> \n <li><strong>SVGs</strong>: Scalable Vector Graphic Files define an image's shape in terms of vectors, meaning they can scale infinitely without losing quality image quality.</li> \n <li><strong>Responsive Images</strong>: Not all of your images are going to be SVGs. For these, you'll want to use CSS rules to automatically adjust the dimensions of the image to fit the users' screen size.</li> \n <li><strong>Fonts</strong>: Make sure that your font is legible across all devices. At a minimum, Google recommends using a base font size of 16 CSS pixels.</li> \n <li><strong>Device Features</strong>: While prospects and customers can't call you over their computers, they definitely can on their smartphones. Consider changing your “Chat Now!” CTA to “Call Now!” and include your business phone number in lieu of email.</li> \n <li><strong>Test</strong>: As always, test your responsive website on different devices and browsers. To see how your website is currently performing, check out <a href=\"https://website.grader.com/\">HubSpot's Website Grader tool</a>.</li> \n</ol> \n<h2><strong>Responsive Web Design vs. Isolated Mobile Web Pages</strong></h2> \n<p>There are two major methods for creating mobile websites: responsive design and mobile templates. Responsive design requires you only have one website that is coded to adapt to all screen sizes, no matter the device the website's being displayed on.</p> \n<p>In contrast, a mobile template is a completely separate entity requiring you to have a second, mobile-only website or subdomain. Mobile templates are also built for each specific site, not per screen size.</p> \n<p>Mobile-only websites can be great solutions for larger applications such as Facebook and Twitter, but for most businesses, a responsive website is much more cost-efficient, and easier to develop and maintain.</p> \n<p>Unlike isolated mobile websites, where you create a whole separate version of a website for mobile devices, responsive design adapts the layout to any screen size by using fluid, proportion-based grids. Responsive websites serve the same HTML to all devices and use CSS media queries to change how your website should look on each device.</p> \n<p>As the number of people surfing the web from their phones continues to climb, a responsive design will make your life as a marketer easier and your website more effective. A mobile-friendly website will save you money in the long run, deliver a great user experience, and perform better across all devices.</p> \n<h2><strong>Responsive Web Design Examples</strong></h2> \n<p>If you aren't using responsive web design already, then you're in luck because it's very easy nowadays to get started with it.</p> \n<p>For example, on the <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/cms\">HubSpot CMS Hub</a> alone, there are hundreds of templates available for free or purchase that are all responsive right out of the box. Let's take a look at five remarkable examples of responsive web design in action from <a href=\"https://designers.hubspot.com/inspire/browse\">HubSpot developers</a> for some inspiration.</p> \n<h3>1. <a href=\"https://www.gingrapp.com/\">Gingr</a>, a pet-care software company, outshines the competition.</h3> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.smartbugmedia.com/\">SmartBug Media</a> designed a new website for a pet-focused SaaS company, Gingr, that reflected the brand's fun voice while providing rich UX and mobile functionality. The design balances organic shapes with realistic imagery, which conveys and reinforces Gingr's unique solution and professional yet modern voice.</p> \n<p>To add texture without creating clutter, the site integrates shapes that play off Gingr's logo, as well as uses organic shapes that resemble animal hair. The website functions well across devices by reorganizing the page elements while keeping the CTA above-the-fold.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Why%20You%20Need%20a%20Responsive%20Web%20Design%20and%20How%20to%20Do%20it%20%5Bwith%20examples%5D-2.jpeg\" alt=\"\">\n</div> \n<h3>2. <a href=\"https://www.sunspacetwincities.com\">Sunspace Twin Cities'</a> new website drives 40% increase in revenue.</h3> \n<p>Specializing in sunspace porch windows, Sunspace Twin Cities provides luxury porch windows to homeowners and contractors in Minnesota and Western Wisconsin.</p> \n<p>The website has a functional UX that makes the most out of the space available on desktop, tablets, and mobile devices. Both the header and body copy are clearly legible, and the simple design allows the website's content to speak for itself. Best of all, once the company updated their website's design, they saw a <a href=\"https://designers.hubspot.com/inspire/entry/new-website-drives-increase-in-revenue\">40% increase in revenue</a>.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Why%20You%20Need%20a%20Responsive%20Web%20Design%20and%20How%20to%20Do%20it%20%5Bwith%20examples%5D.png\" alt=\"\">\n</div> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>3. <a href=\"https://www.hongdaservice.com/\">Hongda Service</a>'s B2B website redesign.</h3> \n<p>It can be difficult to design a website that translates well cross-culturally. Hongda's management team knew that appealing to foreigners was paramount to their success as a China-based company, and they were happy to progress with HubSpot to generate more leads.</p> \n<p>The purpose of their design was to resonate with a Western audience. The blue primary and orange accent colors help this website stand out. Additionally, the site's elements are easy to engage with across devices.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Why%20You%20Need%20a%20Responsive%20Web%20Design%20and%20How%20to%20Do%20it%20%5Bwith%20examples%5D-1.jpeg\" alt=\"\">\n</div> \n<h3>4.

Net4energy aims to inspire and educate users with guides, ebooks, and helpful content.</p> \n<p>With their responsive design, Net4energy is able to offer their content to audiences whether they're in the office or on-the-go. This example functions well because the header copy and CTA are resized to take up the right amount of space on each device without decreasing the readability or usability of the site.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Why%20You%20Need%20a%20Responsive%20Web%20Design%20and%20How%20to%20Do%20it%20%5Bwith%20examples%5D.jpeg\" alt=\"\">\n</div> \n<h3>5. <a href=\"https://www.digitallunchbreak.nsw.gov.au/\">ACYP</a> creates a modular website design.</h3> \n<p>ACYP (the Advocate for Children and Young People) wanted to create a fresh new look for their website and the ability to manage it going forward. This required building page templates and modules using HubSpots's draggable module CMS function.</p> \n<p>The website uses a variety of modules that automatically adjust their width and height depending on the device they're being viewed on.

These age groups are <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/millennials-vs-gen-z?_ga=2.228898654.311160823.1595816611-631527517.1595282187\">more connected to the internet</a>&nbsp;than older age groups,, and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/millennials-vs-gen-z?_ga=2.228898654.311160823.1595816611-631527517.1595282187\">prefer to be entertained or learn new things from online videos</a>.</p> \n<p>At this point, marketers know that they should be leveraging video in their marketing strategy. According to HubSpot's <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/state-of-marketing\">2020 State of Marketing report</a>, video beat out heavyweight contenders like email, blogging, and infographics as the most used type of marketing content.</p> \n<p>The interest in video isn't surprising or new. Throughout the last century, we've seen video move from black and white televisions to smartphones and tablets. As consumers have seen this content become more available at our fingertips, brands have discovered a number of new ways to implement video in their marketing.</p> \n<p>Now, rather than relying on a commercial during our favorite sitcoms to learn about a product, we're inundated with marketing videos <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/social-media-platforms-through-the-decade?_ga=2.228898654.311160823.1595816611-631527517.1595282187\">all over social media</a>, streaming apps, and search result pages.</p> \n<p>Video isn't going anywhere, but it is always expanding, changing, and evolving to fit new consumer needs and new platforms.</p> \n<p>As this content continues to evolve with each new generation, marketers should&nbsp;continue researching video consumers' interests, hobbies, and behaviors.</p> \n<p>In this blog post, I'll highlight six research-backed ways video consumption habits are changing and how marketers can respond strategically.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h2>How Video Consumption is Changing in 2020</h2> \n<h3>1. Consumers are beginning to rely on marketing videos from brands.</h3> \n<p>In the past, consumers would visit websites, look at online reviews, watch commercials, and maybe search out a few YouTube videos to learn about a product. Now, with video being accessible on every major social media network, they are learning to rely more heavily on this type of content in their research phase.</p> \n<p>While brands are seeing <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/state-of-marketing?_ga=2.228898654.311160823.1595816611-631527517.1595282187\">higher engagement than ever from video marketing</a>, consumers increasingly expect&nbsp;to see this type of content from brands. Even back in 2018, a whopping <a href=\"https://www.wyzowl.com/video-marketing-statistics-you-cant-ignore/#79%25_of_people_have_been_convinced_to_buy_a_piece_of_software_or_app_after_watching_a_brand%E2%80%99s_video\">87% of consumers</a>&nbsp;said they wanted to see more video from brands in the next year.</p> \n<p>In 2020, it's likely that the expectation of brands to provide marketing videos has gotten even stronger. Each day, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/state-of-video-marketing-new-data?_ga=2.228898654.311160823.1595816611-631527517.1595282187\">consumers use product demos, video reviews, and unboxings</a>&nbsp;to learn about products before they buy them.</p> \n<p>What do increasing video content expectations mean for you as a marketer? Well, if a prospect is interested in a product or service in your industry, looks for video reviews or tutorials, and can't find any related to your brand's offering, they <a href=\"https://www.wyzowl.com/video-marketing-statistics-you-cant-ignore/#79%25_of_people_have_been_convinced_to_buy_a_piece_of_software_or_app_after_watching_a_brand%E2%80%99s_video\">might buy a product from another brand</a>.</p> \n<p>Why? Videos give consumers the opportunity to see how a product or service works in real life, discover any flaws before purchasing the item, and identify perks that they might not learn about in the text-based description. This content might also appear to be more authentic than a heavily edited product shot, which can boost a consumer's trust in a brand or offering.</p> \n<h3>2. Half of Gen Z and Millennials \"don't know how they'd get through life without video.\"</h3> \n<p>To some, this isn't that much of a shock. Each new generation <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/millennials-vs-gen-z\">has watched more online video than the last</a>. However, when it comes to those under the age of 34, videos have more of an impact on daily life than ever before. In <a href=\"https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/feature/youtube-video-data-watching-habits/\">YouTube's survey</a>, 50% of people in both generations said they \"couldn't live\" without video in their daily lives.</p> \n<p>Aside from using video for entertainment, both millennials and Gen Z prefer to watch videos for <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/millennials-vs-gen-z?_ga=2.128736974.311160823.1595816611-631527517.1595282187\">information gathering purposes</a>. Even when it comes to learning about a new brand or product, these age groups prefer video explainers, product demos, or other marketing videos to simply reading about a company online.</p> \n<p>With <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/millennials-vs-gen-z?_ga=2.128736974.311160823.1595816611-631527517.1595282187\">millennials nearing 40 and Gen Z beginning to gain full purchasing power</a>, there's a good chance that these two age groups will take up a major portion of your audience soon if they &nbsp;aren't already.</p> \n<p>At this point, marketers aiming to attract these two generations should consider testing out video strategies on social media or their own websites. While these age groups might regularly use video for entertainment purposes, it's also likely that they'll use it to <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/millennials-vs-gen-z?_ga=2.128736974.311160823.1595816611-631527517.1595282187\">learn more about products or brands worth investing in</a>. If there's a great video recommendation or tutorial out there for a product they're interested in, they might find it, watch it, and use that content to confirm that this purchase is right for them.</p> \n<h3>3. Video consumers want to relax -- or escape -- from daily life.</h3> \n<p>In the past, older generations might have turned on their favorite TV sitcom or gone to the movies to escape from the stresses of daily life. While the platforms have changed as younger consumers take over the video market, the instinctive need for relaxing or entertaining content hasn't.</p> \n<p>When asked to rank the reasons why consumers watch video content, <a href=\"https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/feature/youtube-video-data-watching-habits/\">YouTube survey </a>participants said they primarily watch videos in order to, \"relax and unwind.\" Additionally, the fourth most common reason that people watch videos is that the content makes them laugh. Additionally, people cited, \"Makes me forget about the world around me,\" as the seventh most common reason for watching videos.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"why consumers watch Youtube videos\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20Video%20Consumption%20Is%20Changing%20in%202020%20%5BNew%20Research%5D.png?width=600&amp;name=How%20Video%20Consumption%20Is%20Changing%20in%202020%20%5BNew%20Research%5D.png\" title=\"\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p style=\"font-size: 10px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/feature/youtube-video-data-watching-habits/\" style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>As a marketer, you shouldn't put all of your time and money into just creating mindless content that will relax your viewers or give them a laugh. But, you can keep in mind that many viewers are still looking to be entertained or intrigued by your content.</p> \n<p>Even when you're creating an informative marketing video, you can consider experimenting with funny anecdotes or adding other entertaining qualities. Interested in adding fun elements to your next marketing video? <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/7-boring-big-brands-that-used-humor-to-amp-up-their-marketing?_ga=2.153195514.311160823.1595816611-631527517.1595282187\">Get inspired by major brands</a>&nbsp;that effectively used humor in their marketing.</p> \n<h3>4. Consumers want to learn more about their niche and passions.</h3> \n<p>Aside from looking for escapism, <a href=\"https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/feature/youtube-video-data-watching-habits/\">YouTube viewers</a>&nbsp;are motivated to watch content that teaches them new things, especially when related to their passions, interests, hobbies, or social causes. While the second most common reasoning for watching a video was it, \"teaches me something new,\" people also said they prioritize content that allows them to \"dig deeper\" into their interests or \"relates to\" their passions.</p> \n<p>Odds are your product relates to someone's interests, hobbies, passions, or career. This is the type of person you'll want to watch and enjoy your videos.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/buyer-persona-research?_ga=2.153195514.311160823.1595816611-631527517.1595282187\">Creating a buyer persona and target audience</a>&nbsp;around this type of person will help you identify video topics that they'll value, benefit from, and remember your brand for publishing.</p> \n<h3>5. Consumers don't care if your video looks like it has a big budget.</h3> \n<p>There's a common misconception that marketing videos need to feature the biggest Hollywood stars and must be shot in a high-priced studio. In 2020, as marketers are increasingly producing video remotely, this myth has definitely been debunked.</p> \n<p>But, if the evolving video marketing workforce hasn't convinced you that low-budget videos can still be effective, here's what YouTube discovered in its survey:</p> \n<p>When asking consumers to rank the top reasons they watched videos, surprisingly <a href=\"https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/feature/youtube-video-data-watching-habits/\">\"high production quality,\" and \"famous actors\"</a>&nbsp;neared the bottom of the list.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"top reasons consumers choose to watch a video\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20Video%20Consumption%20Is%20Changing%20in%202020%20%5BNew%20Research%5D-1.png?width=500&amp;name=How%20Video%20Consumption%20Is%20Changing%20in%202020%20%5BNew%20Research%5D-1.png\" title=\"\" width=\"500\" style=\"width: 500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p style=\"font-size: 10px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/feature/youtube-video-data-watching-habits/\" style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>Aside from ranking high-budget video features as the least likely reasons for watching videos, millennials and Gen Z differ from older age groups in that they're more accepting of user-generated content over professionally made videos. This might hint that brands can leverage content created by their own customers or fans when creating marketing videos:</p> \n<p><img alt=\"Consumers views on user generated content\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20Video%20Consumption%20Is%20Changing%20in%202020%20%5BNew%20Research%5D-3.png?width=400&amp;name=How%20Video%20Consumption%20Is%20Changing%20in%202020%20%5BNew%20Research%5D-3.png\" title=\"\" width=\"400\" style=\"width: 400px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p style=\"font-size: 10px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/feature/youtube-video-data-watching-habits/\" style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>At this point, there are plenty of ways to produce <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-make-a-video-ht?_ga=2.128758350.311160823.1595816611-631527517.1595282187\">an affordable video with solid quality from any home or workspace</a>. And, while it will still take time and money to launch this content, effective marketing videos made anywhere can boost your level of brand awareness.</p> \n<h3>6. Younger generations are watching longer content.</h3> \n<p>The average Gen Z member has <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/millennials-vs-gen-z?_ga=2.153777914.311160823.1595816611-631527517.1595282187\">an online attention span of eight seconds</a>. That's <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/millennials-vs-gen-z?_ga=2.153777914.311160823.1595816611-631527517.1595282187\">four seconds less than millennials</a>. But although Gen Z's attention span for general online surfing might be quite short, long-form videos that interest them can grasp their attention -- and keep it.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"video consumption demographics\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20Video%20Consumption%20Is%20Changing%20in%202020%20%5BNew%20Research%5D-2.png?width=600&amp;name=How%20Video%20Consumption%20Is%20Changing%20in%202020%20%5BNew%20Research%5D-2.png\" title=\"\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p style=\"font-size: 10px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/feature/youtube-video-data-watching-habits/\" style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>The adoption of long-form content with each new generation isn't new. According to <a href=\"https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/feature/youtube-video-data-watching-habits/\">YouTube's study</a>, millennials also watched longer-form videos more often than their Gen X predecessors.</p> \n<p>As a marketer, you'll need to keep the attention spans of each new generation in mind as you set the pace for your video content.</p> \n<p>Your video has mere seconds to catch a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/millennials-vs-gen-z?_ga=2.153777914.311160823.1595816611-631527517.1595282187\">millennial or Gen Z member's</a>&nbsp;attention as they're aimlessly scrolling through a social media feed. However, if your video captures viewers immediately and then continues to offer entertaining, valuable, or interesting information throughout, these age groups might watch the whole thing -- even if it is on the longer side.</p> \n<p>Before you put a marketing video online, re-watch it from the point-of-view of a somewhat busy consumer. Then, ask yourself, \"Does this video pull viewers into the action quickly and keep their attention?\" If you're worried that parts of your video seem dull, you might want to shorten it. But, if your team thinks it's entertaining or informative the entire time, you can experiment with publishing your longer-form video and learning from its results.</p> \n<h2>Navigating Video in 2020</h2> \n<p>With each new generation, the video world will continue to evolve.</p> \n<p>However, at this point, the video landscape is changing in favor of marketers. Not only do consumers <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/millennials-vs-gen-z?_ga=2.236223299.311160823.1595816611-631527517.1595282187\">prefer to learn about brands via video content</a>, but they use it as a necessary tool in the information-gathering phase of their buyer's journey.</p> \n<p>Additionally, the vast majority of video consumers now strive to learn something new about an interest or hobby, rather than just using video to entertain themselves. This means marketers can harness educational videos in their strategy and offer consumers content that relates to their niche, while also marketing a brand or product.</p> \n<p>In 2020, you don't need a high-priced video budget to succeed as a marketer. You just need to create content that engages, educates, and intrigues your audience.</p> \n<p>To learn more about how to create a winning marketing video -- even on a budget -- check out <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/video-marketing\">this how-to post</a>.

Lead generation is the process of converting people who've heard of your company into people who want to hear from your company more often. And then when those leads trust you and view you as an expert in your industry, they're more likely to convert into customers.</li> \n <li><strong>Thought leadership/brand awareness. </strong>If you're hoping to position your company as a knowledgeable expert within your industry, your primary content marketing goal is probably thought leadership. Consistently getting thought leadership content published in trusted publications — whether through guest-contributed articles or press mentions — is a fantastic way to build credibility with your audience.</li> \n <li><strong>SEO.</strong> If there's a lot of competition in your space and you're gunning for the top spot in your target audience's mind, your primary goal for content marketing is probably SEO. SEO works to get your website to the top of the list when your audience looks for certain keywords in search engines. The content on your site and the pages that link to your site give your website a better score, boosting your overall credibility with the search engine.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>If you didn't have a specific content marketing goal in mind before you started reading, pick the one from the list above that's most important to you right now. Keep that goal in mind as you keep reading.</p> \n<h2><strong>SEO Strategies to Reach Any Content Marketing Goal</strong></h2> \n<p>Now that you have a specific goal in mind, let's take a look at a few SEO strategies that can help you improve your content marketing results, as well as how you can apply these SEO strategies to reach your content marketing goals.</p> \n<h3>1. Keyword Research</h3> \n<p>To put it simply, keyword research lets you see what search terms you're currently ranking for, what others in your industry are ranking for, and which keywords could use more of your attention.</p> \n<p>For example, you might discover that your audience is looking for \"guides on creating a content marketing strategy.\" While a certain publication you want to partner with might not be looking for an article that spells this out in a lengthy, detailed how-to guide, you <em>could</em> write a higher-level article for that publication that links to a white-paper on your site that dives deeper into the process of developing an effective content marketing strategy.</p> \n<p>This would allow you to create content that your audience is looking for, while also publishing in an important publication that helps demonstrate your brand as a thought leader in the industry. Of course, researching your keywords will look the same regardless of your content marketing goal — but the way you <em>use</em> that information will differ.</p> \n<p>If your primary goal is <strong>lead generation</strong>, keyword research can enable you to identify pain points or sales objections you might want to cover in your content. This will allow you to tailor your content to what your audience actually wants to know and strategically use keywords related to your audiences' searches so you can reach them in search results. Once you reach them there, you can hopefully lead them to your site to engage with your company further.</p> \n<p>Focusing on <strong>thought leadership</strong>? Keyword research can help you find out what questions your audience has so you can provide answers and position your company as authorities in your industry. You can include short-tail (e.g., \"AI\") and long-tail (e.g., \"what is artificial intelligence\") keywords in your content to rank for those keywords and further solidify your place as a thought leader online. After all, if your audience members don't find you when they search for information related to your expertise, they probably won't consider you a credible expert.</p> \n<p>If <strong>SEO</strong> is your focus, keyword research lets you see how you stack up against the competition when it comes to ranking for important keywords in your industry. It will give you insight into what keywords your content initiatives should focus on so you can improve those rankings and be more competitive on search engine results pages.</p> \n<p>To <a href=\"https://blog.influenceandco.com/5-steps-to-keyword-research-that-will-boost-your-content-marketing\">conduct keyword research</a>, analyze your website's current rankings, identify keywords your competition doesn't rank for but that might be good opportunities, look for question-based keywords you can focus on to answer your audience's queries, and cluster your findings so you can identify trends. Google's autocomplete, similar searches, or <a href=\"https://support.google.com/adwords/answer/2999770?hl=en\">Keyword Planner</a> are accessible ways to explore what your audience is searching for. If you want to go deeper, you can use a keyword tool like <a href=\"https://ahrefs.com/\">Ahrefs</a>, <a href=\"https://www.semrush.com/\">SEMrush</a>, or <a href=\"https://moz.com/\">Moz</a> to get a more well-rounded picture.</p> \n<h3>2. Topic Clusters</h3> \n<p>Search engines' algorithms favor topic-based content, so it can be beneficial to link related content under \"<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/topic-clusters-seo\">topic clusters</a>.\" Basically, building topic clusters allows you to provide deeper coverage across a range of core topics and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-marketing-strategy\">create an efficient information architecture</a>.</p> \n<p>You can develop a pillar page for each of your company's main focus areas. Then you'll build out more specific subtopics, or \"cluster content.\" These pieces of cluster content will provide more detail related to a specific long-form keyword that's related to the main topic you covered on the pillar page. The pillar links to each cluster page, and each piece of cluster content links back to the pillar with the same hyperlinked keyword.</p> \n<p>For example, at my company, <a href=\"https://www.influenceandco.com/\">Influence &amp; Co.,</a> we created a pillar page titled \"<a href=\"https://blog.influenceandco.com/what-is-content-marketing\">The Ultimate Guide to Content Marketing</a>.\" This is a longer piece of content that covers six ways readers can take their content marketing to the next level, diving deep into how to achieve the advice in each section. This pillar page links out to multiple cluster pages (and the cluster pages link back), which results in that solid architecture I just mentioned.</p> \n<p>We also produced a couple of guest-contributed articles related to this pillar page to create a comprehensive content plan that provides a wide range of specific, tactical content to help our audience better understand content marketing — and how to do it well.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Content-Map.Landing-Page-01-1.png\" alt=\"Content-Map.Landing-Page-01-1\">\n</div> \n<p>If you're focusing on <strong>lead generation</strong>, this linking ecosystem enables you to keep your audience members engaged with your content longer, which boosts the likelihood that they'll fill out a form or reach out to you. Plus, as your audience members spend more time on your site, they learn more about your company, making them more qualified leads once they do decide to take the leap and give you their information.</p> \n<p>Topic clusters can benefit a <strong>thought leadership</strong> strategy as well, because this approach lets you create overview content <em>and</em> in-depth content, which positions you as a thorough expert on the subject matter that your audience is interested in and cares about.</p> \n<p>Finally, working to achieve <strong>SEO</strong> goals? This model can help you organize your site's structure.</p> \n<p>Building a strong information architecture can lead to better rankings in organic search across a broad subject area. Those hyper-focused pieces of cluster content will allow you to work toward that strong architecture while also maintaining your focus on producing content that your audience cares about. Plus, creating one high-performing cluster page can elevate search rankings to all of the other pages that are linked to the same pillar.</p> \n<p>A great way to plan out your topic clusters is to develop a content map. Before you even begin creating content, decide what your pillar page will focus on. Then nail down topics for a few cluster pages. You can even take it a step further and identify what subjects you'd like to cover in guest-contributed articles related to that overarching topic. We've put together a free <a href=\"https://offers.influenceandco.com/download-your-customizable-content-map?hsCtaTracking=ac2b69fb-106d-46bd-8d54-3e14e3020fac%7Cf7625b73-4211-455a-abd0-01beadbe2505\">content map template</a> that you can use to get started.</p> \n<h3>3. Optimizing Blog Posts</h3> \n<p>Blogging can position your website as a relevant answer to your target audience's burning questions. And optimizing those posts for search can help you actually reach your audience members so you can provide the value they're looking for.</p> \n<p>Blog post optimization can advance both <strong>thought leadership</strong> and <strong>lead generation</strong> goals because if the content you're producing for your site isn't ranking well, it isn't showing up as a relevant answer to your audience's questions. This means you won't be perceived as an expert, and you most definitely won't generate more leads.</p> \n<p>If you're focusing on <strong>SEO</strong> as your primary goal, optimizing blog posts is a given. Your content isn't going to rank well if you're not including relevant short- and long-tail keywords that your audience cares about.</p> \n<p>To <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/blog-search-engine-optimization\">optimize your blog content</a>, focus on one or two long-tail keywords that line up with the intent of your target readership, and include those keywords in your post where they fit in naturally. For example, if your audience has been searching for information on creating a predictive analytics strategy, you'll want to publish a blog post about the strategy and techniques behind predictive analytics.</p> \n<p>When writing that post, you'll need to include long-tail keywords for which people are searching. Those might include \"how to do predictive analytics,\" \"predictive analytics strategies,\" and \"predictive analytics techniques.\" This way, your blog post will show up in search results for people who are looking for more detailed insights on developing a predictive analytics strategy.</p> \n<p>In addition, make sure your blog is <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/improve-your-websites-user-experience\">responsive and mobile-friendly</a>. Creating a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/meta-descriptions\">meta description</a> that's keyword-rich, optimizing your images with <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/image-alt-text\">alt text</a>, and linking to other pages on your blog whenever possible will also help you rank.</p> \n<p>These are just a few SEO strategies that can help you reach your content marketing goals, whether you're focusing on SEO itself, thought leadership, or lead generation. This certainly isn't an exhaustive list, but it'll get you started on your journey of optimizing your way to better content marketing results.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fhow-seo-can-help-nonorganic-goals&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 28 Jul 2020 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/seo-nonorganic-goals.jpg#keepProtocol","linkMd5":"899f9b9af236b584178f3d560b0dac7d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn37@2020_3/2020-07-30/1596118303753_63d73dc2034008c9.webp","metaImg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/seo-nonorganic-goals.jpg#keepProtocol","author":"Kelsey Raymond","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/SEO-Jul-28-2020-01-29-48-13-PM.png?width=1500&name=SEO-Jul-28-2020-01-29-48-13-PM.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn29@2020_4/2020-07-30/1596118313562_987c6dcf20aae9f1.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Content-Map.Landing-Page-01-1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn14@2020_3/2020-07-30/1596118310328_16f2e6a38b9952f7.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fhow-seo-can-help-nonorganic-goals&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn85@2020_2/2020-07-30/1596118307978_a3cfd063656f3386.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-07-30 22:11:40","updatedTime":"2020-07-30 14:11:40","title":"17 Blogging Mistakes to Avoid in 2020, According to HubSpot Bloggers","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/beginner-blogger-mistakes","description":"<p>Sometimes, when I tell people that I blog for a living, they roll their eyes. \"That's so easy,\" they say. \"You get a paycheck for sitting on the internet all day and writing.

Below are common mistakes most beginners make and some tips on how to avoid them.</p> \n<h2>What Is a Blog?</h2> \n<p>Simply put, a blog is a tool that can help develop an online presence, attract leads, and engage with an audience. It's often a series of editorial content centered around a central topic that demonstrates industry expertise -- for instance, a catering company might write blog posts like \"The 11 Best Appetizers to Serve to a Crowd\" or \"Stress-Free Dinner Parties: Recipes that are Prepared Ahead of Time\".</p> \n<p>Blogs can help drive traffic to your website, convert that traffic into leads, establish authority in your industry, and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-is-a-blog?_ga=2.117054918.1559363486.1561986372-527251855.1560789477\">ultimately grow your business</a>.

However, there are a lot of organizations competing for your audience's attention, so it's important to avoid common blog mistakes to stand out.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Here are the most common blog post mistakes (and their solutions), according to HubSpot bloggers.</p> \n<h3>1. Create blog posts that serve your larger company goals.</h3> \n<h4>Mistake: You think of ideas that only interest you.</h4> \n<p>As much as you might read and re-read your blog posts after you publish them, you're not the only reader, or the intended reader.</p> \n<p>When you start blogging, ideas will come to you at random times -- in the shower, on a run, while on the phone with your mom. While the ideas may come at random moments, the ideas themselves should never be random. Just because it's a good idea in general -- or something that interests you personally -- doesn't mean it's a good idea for your company.</p> \n<h4>Solution: Align your blog posts with company growth goals.</h4> \n<p>The reason you're blogging is to solve problems for your audience and, ultimately, to grow your business. So, all of your blog post ideas should <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33898/How-to-Set-SMART-Marketing-Goals-for-2013-TEMPLATE.aspx\">help serve those growth goals</a>. They should have natural tie-ins to issues in your industry and address specific questions and concerns your prospects have.</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>\"Your blog is a honeypot, not a megaphone. Make a point to position your content around what your audience wants to discover, not what you want to tell them.\"</p> \n <p style=\"font-size: 18px;\">&nbsp;</p> \n <p style=\"font-size: 20px;\">— Amanda Sellers, HubSpot's Historical Optimization Writer</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Need help figuring out what those goals are and how to address them? Chat with your manager about the larger company goals, and then <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/sales/schedule-meeting\">schedule a meeting</a> with someone on the sales team to hear what questions they get asked most often. After both meetings, you should know which goals you need to achieve and have some ideas on how to achieve them.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h3>2. Identify what resonates with your audience.&nbsp;</h3> \n<h4>Mistake: You forget about your persona.&nbsp;</h4> \n<p>If you want your blog content to perform well (i.e. generate traffic, leads, and sales), it must resonate with your audience and compel them to take action. One of the biggest mistakes is assuming that your content will perform if you haven't actually considered your audience or the actions you want them to take.</p> \n<h4>Solution: Understand your persona's pains and solve for them.</h4> \n<p>By <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/make-my-persona\">defining your buyer persona</a> and the things that matter to them, you can bridge the gap with your content.&nbsp;</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>\"Your persona is the basis for everything you create. Writing for yourself won’t always resonate with your intended audience. If you, instead, speak your persona’s pains, challenges, and goals and they feel like you are speaking to them, they are more likely to stay on the page and convert on your offer.\"</p> \n <p style=\"font-size: 18px;\">&nbsp;</p> \n <p style=\"font-size: 20px;\">— Christina Perricone, Content Marketing Manager at HubSpot</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>If you're not consciously thinking about your persona's pains, you're just creating content for content's sake, which is a waste of resources.</p> \n<h3>3. Write like you talk.</h3> \n<h4>Mistake: Your writing is too stiff.</h4> \n<p>Writing a blog post is much different than writing a term paper. But when bloggers first start out, they usually only have experience with the latter. The problem? The style of writing from a term paper is <em>not</em> the style of writing people enjoy reading.</p> \n<p>Let's be honest: Most of the people who see your post aren't going to read the whole thing. If you want to keep them interested, you have to compel them to keep reading by <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/hard-to-read-blog-posts\">writing in a style that's effortless to read</a>.</p> \n<h4>Solution: Try to write blogs that feel personable.&nbsp;</h4> \n<p>It's okay to be more conversational in your writing -- in fact, we encourage it. The <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-write-interesting-content\">more approachable your writing is</a>, the more people will enjoy reading it. People want to feel like they're doing business with real people, not robots.</p> \n<p>So loosen up your writing. Throw in contractions. Get rid of the jargon. Make a pun or two. That's how real people talk -- and that's what real people like to read.</p> \n<h3>4. Show your personality; don't tell it.</h3> \n<h4>Mistake: You think people care about <em>you</em> as a writer.</h4> \n<p>It sounds harsh, but it's the truth: When people first start out blogging, they think that their audience will be inherently interested in <em>their </em>stories and <em>their</em> interests ... but that's not the case. It's no knock against them as a person -- it's just that when you're new, no one is interested in you and your experiences. People care way more about what you can teach them.</p> \n<h4>Solution: Infuse your personality without eclipsing the topic.</h4> \n<p>Even though people don't really care that it's <em>you</em> that's writing the post, you can infuse parts of your personality in your writing to make them feel more comfortable with you. How you do that is entirely up to you. Some people like to crack jokes, some like to make pop culture references, and others have a way with vivid descriptions.</p> \n<p>HubSpot's Director of Content <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/coreyeridon\">Corey Wainwright</a> is particularly good at this. Here's an example from the introduction <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-crowdsource-blog-post-google-docs\">of one of her posts</a>:</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/show-personality-in-blog-post.png?width=600&amp;name=show-personality-in-blog-post.png\" alt=\"show-personality-in-blog-post.png\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>To infuse personality into your own writing, try looking for ways to relate to your readers on the topic you're writing about -- then write in the first person as if you're hanging out with them and chatting about it. Make your tone personal, approachable, and engaging, just like you would in a face-to-face conversation.</p> \n<h3>5. Make your point again and again.</h3> \n<h4>Mistake: You digress.</h4> \n<p>Although you are encouraged to let your own personality shine through in your writing, don't abuse the privilege. It's one thing to be yourself in the topic you're covering, but it's another thing to bring up too many personal experiences that bury the point you're trying to make.</p> \n<p>Don't digress into these personal anecdotes and analogies too much -- your readers aren't sitting in front of you, which means you can't guarantee that you have their undivided attention. They can (and will) bounce from your article if they lose patience.&nbsp;</p> \n<h4>Solution: Repeatedly assert your argument.&nbsp;</h4> \n<p>To prevent your writing from losing its audience, restate your point in every section of the article. The best blog posts commit to an overarching message and then deliver it gradually, expressing it multiple times in small ways from beginning to end.</p> \n<p>If you're writing about how much water a potted plant needs, for example, don't spend three paragraphs telling a story of how you came home to a dead fern after returning from a two-week vacation. This story offers real evidence of your point, but what&nbsp;<em>is</em> your point? Certain plants can't go without water for more than 14 days. That's one possible point, and it should be stated upfront.</p> \n<h3>6. Start with a very specific working title.</h3> \n<h4>Mistake: Your topics are too broad.</h4> \n<p>When people start blogging, they generally want to write on really big topics like:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>\"How to Do Social Media Marketing\"</li> \n <li>\"Business Best Practices\"</li> \n <li>\"How to Make Money on the Internet\"</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Topics like these are far too broad. Because there are so many details and nuances in these topics, it's really hard to do a good job answering them. Plus, more specific topics tend to attract smaller, more targeted audiences, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/definition-long-tail-keyword-100-words-sr\">which tend to be higher quality</a> and more likely to convert into leads and customers.</p> \n<p>So, to get the most short-term and long-term benefits of blogging, you'll need to get way more specific.</p> \n<h4>Solution: Begin with a clear, concise idea.</h4> \n<p>Nailing really specific blog topics is crucial to knocking your first few posts out of the park. Let us help you brainstorm with our <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/blog-topic-generator\">Blog Ideas Generator</a>. This tool allows you to enter basic terms you know you want to cover, and then produces five sample blog titles that work for business blogs.</p> \n<p>Keep in mind that a working title isn't final -- it's just a concrete angle you can use to keep your writing on track. Once you nail this stage of the ideation process, it's much easier to write your blog posts.</p> \n<h3>7. Specific posts should still tie into the bigger picture.&nbsp;</h3> \n<h4>Mistake: You're don't tie a specific topic into your reader's broader struggle.&nbsp;</h4> \n<p>You already know how important it is to resonate with your buyer persona and understand their pain points. However, there's a reason why they're experiencing pain points and what is driving them to get it solved.&nbsp;</p> \n<h4>Solution: Understand the challenges and consequences they're facing.</h4> \n<p>You should be asking yourself:&nbsp;</p> \n<ul> \n <li>What is at stake?</li> \n <li>What do they gain by taking action?</li> \n <li>What are they afraid of happening if they don't take action?</li> \n</ul> \n<p>All of these things can manifest in the content that you write for your blog post. Doing so will signal to your reader that you understand what they're going through and you want to help.</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>\"If you're uninterested in a particular topic you're writing about, it's probably because you haven't stopped to think big-picture. Understanding how the topic you're writing about will fit into a reader's broader challenges will help you find meaning and value in any post you write, and will enable you to connect with your readers better.\"</p> \n <p style=\"font-size: 18px;\">&nbsp;</p> \n <p style=\"font-size: 20px;\">— Caroline Forsey, Editor of the HubSpot Marketing Blog</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>For instance, let's say you're tackling a post like \"first vs. third-party APIs.\" While the topic is dry and allows for little creativity, the big-picture value is huge: to help your readers decide whether they need to shell over the big bucks for an in-house API or whether they can save money and time by asking a third-party to develop their API. Essentially, \"first vs. third party APIs\" is a question that hits at computer security, efficiency, and budget constraints, all of which could have big consequences for your reader.</p> \n<h3>8. Use a specific post type, create an outline, and use headers.</h3> \n<h4>Mistake: Your writing is a brain dump.</h4> \n<p>Sometimes when I get a great idea I'm excited about, it's really tempting to just sit down and let it flow out of me. But what I get is usually a sub-par blog post.</p> \n<p>Why? The stream-of-consciousness style of writing isn't really a good style for blog posts. Most people are going to scan your blog posts, not read them, so it needs to be organized really well for that to happen.</p> \n<h4>Solution: Structure your blog with a template, outline, and section headers.</h4> \n<p>The first thing you should do is choose what <em>type </em>of blog post you're going to write. Is it a how-to post? A list-based post? A curated collection post? A SlideShare presentation? For help on this, <strong><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/blog-post-templates\">download our free templates for creating five different types of blog posts</a>. </strong>Once you have a template down, it'll be easier to write your outline.</p> \n<p>Writing an outline makes a big difference. If you put in the time up front to organize your thoughts and create a logical flow in your post, the rest becomes easy -- you're basically just filling in the blanks.</p> \n<p>Using headers is also critical for reader experience.&nbsp;</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>\"While it's nice to imagine that your readers hang on your every word, the reality is that they're probably mostly skimming your posts. As you write, be sure you're making your piece skim-friendly: including plenty of paragraph breaks, clearly titled sections, relevant images, and formatting that makes it easy to find the piece of information they likely came for.\"</p> \n <p style=\"font-size: 18px;\">&nbsp;</p> \n <p style=\"font-size: 20px;\">— Karla Cook, Sr. Manager of the HubSpot Blog Team</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>To write a blog post outline, first come up with a list of the top takeaways you want your readers to get from your post. Then, break up those takeaways into larger section headers. When you put in a section header every few paragraphs, your blog post becomes easier and more enjoyable to read. (And plus, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/seo-friendly-blog-post-checklist-ht\">header text with keywords is good for SEO</a>.) When you finally get to writing, all you'll have to do is fill in those sections.</p> \n<h3>9. Give your audience something to walk away with.</h3> \n<h4>Mistake: You're relying on the conceptual instead of the concrete.</h4> \n<p>One of the first things you’ll do in your blog research is look up how other publications are writing about a topic. However, if you notice, almost all the results on the first page of Google are writing about conceptual, vague ideas. How can your blog stick out? You can include actual, actionable steps to achieve success.</p> \n<h4>Solution: Include actionable steps to achieve success.</h4> \n<p>One of the biggest tenets of content creation is that it should be useful, and that means your audience should walk away with something.&nbsp;</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>\"People want to learn how to do things in actuality, not just theoretically. When you’re done with a blog, ask yourself, 'Will the reader know how to implement this idea?' or 'Did I provide steps to achieve success?'\"</p> \n <p style=\"font-size: 18px;\">&nbsp;</p> \n <p style=\"font-size: 20px;\">— Rebecca White, Jr. Staff Writer at HubSpot</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>This might come in the form of a \"how-to\" as you recommend they implement a particular strategy, or it might simply be a suggestion for a tool or tactic to make a process easier.</p> \n<h3>10. Use data and research to back up the claims you make in your posts.</h3> \n<h4>Mistake: You don't use data as evidence.</h4> \n<p>Let's say I'm writing a blog post about why businesses should consider using Instagram for marketing. When I'm making that argument, which is more convincing?</p> \n<ol> \n <li>\"It seems like more people are using Instagram nowadays.\"</li> \n <li>\"Instagram’s user base is growing far faster than social network usage in general in the U.S. <a href=\"http://www.emarketer.com/Article/Instagram-Continues-Double-Digit-Growth/1013612#sthash.jucUQgyf.dpuf\">Instagram will grow 15.1% this year</a>, compared to just 3.1% growth for the social network sector as a whole.\"</li> \n</ol> \n<p>The second, of course. Arguments and claims are much more compelling when rooted in data and research. As marketers, we don’t just have to convince people to be on our side about an issue -- we need to convince them to <em>take action.</em> Data-driven content catches people's attention in a way that fluffy arguments do not.</p> \n<h4>Solution: Use data to support your arguments.&nbsp;</h4> \n<p>In any good story, you’ll offer a main argument, establish proof, and then end with a takeaway for the audience. You can <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-use-data-in-marketing-content\">use data in blog posts</a> to introduce your main argument and show why it's relevant to your readers, or as proof of it throughout the body of the post.</p> \n<p>Some great places to find compelling data include:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://research.hubspot.com/\">HubSpot Research</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/\">Pew Research Center</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"http://www.marketingsherpa.com/freestuff.html\">MarketingSherpa</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.stateofinbound.com/\">HubSpot's <em>State of Inbound</em> report</a></li> \n</ul> \n<h3>11. Use examples to back up why what you're saying is important.&nbsp;</h3> \n<h4>Mistake: You're not adding enough context.&nbsp;</h4> \n<p>Meg Prater, Managing Editor of the HubSpot blogs, shared with us that “When I first joined the HubSpot Blog team, I would consistently get the edit that I wasn’t adding enough examples to support my statements. For example (See what I did there?), I might write ‘SMBs should expand their social media strategies to experiment with newer, cheaper channels.’ Sure, that might be true, but it’s a pretty broad suggestion.</p> \n<h4>Solution: Illustrate ideas with examples, visual aids, and additional content.&nbsp;</h4> \n<p>A stronger way to share this with an audience might be to say, 'SMBs should expand their social media strategies to experiment with newer, cheaper channels. For example, you might test running ads on question-and-answer platform Quora, or simply answer industry questions for which your product or service is an answer.'</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>\"By adding a specific example to my previously broad statement, I’ve made my point easier to understand and more actionable for my readers.\"</p> \n <p style=\"font-size: 18px;\">&nbsp;</p> \n <p style=\"font-size: 20px;\">— Meg Prater, Managing Editor of the HubSpot Blogs</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>As bloggers, we become experts in our industry. Because of this, it's easy to forget about specificity when giving advice, explaining examples, or walking through a common process. Even Pamela Bump, HubSpot's Staff Writer for Audience Growth, admits that she has been guilty of not going into enough depth in a first draft.</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>\"When you review your blog post, read it from the point of view of a new grad entering a field or someone who's just learning about a topic for the first time.\"</p> \n <p style=\"font-size: 18px;\">&nbsp;</p> \n <p style=\"font-size: 20px;\">— Pamela Bump, HubSpot's Staff Writer for Audience Growth</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Ask yourself questions like, \"Will readers know what this big word means?\", \"Will they recognize this acronym?\", or \"Can they easily visualize this example, or do I need to add a visual aid?\" From there, you can determine where you need to explain something more, or hyperlink potentially confusing words other blog posts that relate to them.</p> \n<h3>12. When drawing from others' ideas, cite them.</h3> \n<h4>Mistake: Your content borders on plagiarism.</h4> \n<p>Plagiarism didn't work in school, and it certainly doesn't work on your company's blog. But for some reason, many beginner bloggers think they can get away with the old copy-and-paste technique.</p> \n<p>You can't. Editors and readers can usually tell when something's been copied from somewhere else. Your voice suddenly doesn't sound like you, or maybe there are a few words in there that are incorrectly used. It just sounds ... off.</p> \n<p>Plus, if you get caught <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/internet-content-theft\">stealing other people's content</a>, you could get your site penalized by Google -- which could be a big blow to your company blog's organic growth.</p> \n<h4><strong>Solution: Give credit where credit is due.&nbsp;</strong></h4> \n<p>Instead, take a few minutes to <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33098/How-Not-to-Steal-People-s-Content-on-the-Web.aspx\">understand how to cite other people's content in your blog posts</a>. It's not super complicated, but it's an essential thing to learn when you're first starting out.</p> \n<h3>13. Take 30 minutes to edit your post.</h3> \n<h4>Mistake: You think you're done once the writing's done.</h4> \n<p>Most people make the mistake of not editing their writing. It sounded so fluid in their head when they were writing that it <em>must</em> be great to read ... right?</p> \n<p>Nope -- it still needs editing. And maybe a lot of it.</p> \n<h4>Solution: You'll never regret time spent proofreading.&nbsp;</h4> \n<p>Everyone needs to edit their writing -- even the most experienced writers. Most times, our first drafts aren't all that great. So take the time you need to shape up your post. Fix typos, run-on sentences, and accidental its/it's mistakes. Make sure your story flows just as well as it did in your outline.</p> \n<p>To help you remember all the little things to check before publishing, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ultimate-editing-checklist\">check out our checklist for editing and proofreading a blog post</a>.</p> \n<h3>14. At a certain point, just publish it.</h3> \n<h4>Mistake: You try to make every post perfect.</h4> \n<p>I hate to break it to you, but <strong>your blog post is</strong> <strong>never</strong> <strong>going to be perfect. </strong>Ever.</p> \n<p>There will <em>always</em> be more things you can do to make your posts better. More images. Better phrasing. Wittier jokes. The best writers I know, know when to stop obsessing and just hit \"publish.\"</p> \n<h4>Solution: Better to publish and update than postpone for perfection.&nbsp;</h4> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/good-enough-content-creation-design\">There's a point</a> at which there are diminishing returns for getting closer to \"perfect\" -- and you're really never going to reach \"perfect\" anyway. So while you don't want to publish a post filled with factual inaccuracies and grammatical errors, it's not the end of the world if a typo slips through. It most likely won't affect how many views and leads it brings in.</p> \n<p>Plus, if you (or your readers) find the mistake, all of you have to do is update the post. No biggie. So give yourself a break once and a while -- perfect is the enemy of done.</p> \n<h3>15. Blog consistently with the help of an editorial calendar.</h3> \n<h4>Mistake: You don't blog consistently.</h4> \n<p>By now, you've probably heard that <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/blogging-frequency-benchmarks?_ga=1.30446463.1733063552.1465306056#sm.0001ralmokx9oe96wpl15ahh67v4e\">the more often you blog</a>, the more traffic you'll get to your website -- and the more subscribers and leads you'll generate from your posts. But as important as volume is, it's actually more important that you're blogging <em>consistently</em> when you're just getting started. If you publish five posts in one week and then only one or two in the next few weeks, it'll be hard to form a consistent habit. And inconsistency could really confuse your subscribers.</p> \n<p>Instead, it's the companies that make a commitment to regularly publishing quality content to their blogs that tend to reap the biggest rewards in terms of website traffic and leads -- and those results continue to pay out over time.</p> \n<p>To help establish consistency, you'll need a more concrete planning strategy.</p> \n<h4>Solution: Schedule and publish blogs consistently.&nbsp;</h4> \n<p>Use it to get into the habit of planning your blog post topics ahead of time, publishing consistently, and even scheduling posts in advance if you're finding yourself having a particularly productive week.</p> \n<p>Here at HubSpot, we typically use good ol' Google Calendar as our blog editorial calendar, which <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/create-robust-editorial-calendar-ht\">you can learn how to set up step-by-step here</a>. Or, you can <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/blog-editorial-calendar\">click here to download our free editorial calendar templates</a> for Excel, Google Sheets, and Google Calendar, along with instructions on how to set them up.</p> \n<h3>16. Focus on the long-term benefits of organic traffic.</h3> \n<h4>Mistake: You concentrate your analytics on immediate traffic.</h4> \n<p>Both beginner bloggers and advanced bloggers are guilty of this blogging mistake. If you concentrate your analysis on immediate traffic (traffic from email subscribers, RSS feeds, and social shares), then it's going to be hard to prove the enduring value of your blog. After all, the half-life for those sources is very brief -- usually a day or two.</p> \n<p>When marketers who are just starting their business blogs see that their blog posts aren't generating any new traffic after a few days, many of them get frustrated. They think their blog is failing, and they <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/blog-failing-change-perspective\">end up abandoning it prematurely</a>.</p> \n<h4>Solution: The ROI of your blog is the aggregation of organic traffic over time.</h4> \n<p>Instead of focusing on the sudden decay of short-term traffic, focus instead on the cumulative potential of organic traffic. Over time, given <em>enough </em>time, the traffic from day three and beyond of a single blog post will eclipse that big spike on days one and two <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/seo-friendly-blog-post-checklist-ht#sm.0000o5c3iom8gdkipdw2l236rj19q\">thanks to being found on search engine results pages through organic search</a>. You just have to give it a while.</p> \n<p>To help drive this long-term traffic, make sure you're writing blog posts that have durable relevance on a consistent basis. These posts <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/31501/Why-Every-Business-Blog-Needs-Evergreen-Content.aspx\">are called \"evergreen\" blog posts</a>: They're relevant year after year with little or no upkeep, valuable, and high quality.</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>\"Your evergreen content is an ongoing asset and in many cases has more potential to perform than a new, unproven post.\"</p> \n <p style=\"font-size: 18px;\">&nbsp;</p> \n <p style=\"font-size: 20px;\">— Amanda Sellers, HubSpot's Historical Optimization Writer</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Over time, as you write more evergreen content and build search authority, those posts <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/hubspot-blog-compounding-posts\">will end up being responsible for a large percentage of your blog traffic</a>. It all starts with a slight shift in perspective from daily traffic to cumulative traffic so you can reframe the way you view your blog and its ROI entirely.</p> \n<h3>17. Add a subscription CTA to your blog and set up an email newsletter.</h3> \n<h4>Mistake: You aren't growing subscribers.</h4> \n<p>Once you start blogging, it's easy to forget that blogging isn't just about getting <em>new</em> visitors to your blog. One of <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/the-benefits-of-business-blogging-ht\">the biggest benefits of blogging</a> is that it helps you steadily grow an email list of subscribers you can share your new content with.

What I like about the site is how easy it is to navigate. If I were accessing the website for the first time, I wouldn't have any worries about how to use it to my benefit.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Have you ever visited a website and noticed small phrases of text that guide you to your goal? Or, when you make an online purchase, is there text on the web page that lets you know your payment information is secure?</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>That text is called microcopy, and it's a wonderful tool for UX. For instance, let's say I was visiting Yelp for the first time today, without knowing what the website's purpose was. I wouldn't have to worry because the microcopy helps fill in that confusion.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"Microcopy on Yelp \" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/It%E2%80%99s%20the%20Little%20Things%20How%20To%20Write%20Microcopy-4.png?width=624&amp;height=196&amp;name=It%E2%80%99s%20the%20Little%20Things%20How%20To%20Write%20Microcopy-4.png\" title=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"196\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 13px;\"><a href=\"http://yelp.com\" style=\"font-style: italic; font-weight: normal;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>In the search bar, the microcopy tells me the types of things I could search, and where I can set my location. \"Burgers, barbers, spas, handymen…\" are all examples of what I can find using the site, which is super helpful for a first-time user.</p> \n<p>Additionally, the location settings tell me I could search for businesses near me or elsewhere. So when I move in a couple of weeks, I won't have to wait until I arrive to search for restaurants near my new place.</p> \n<p>It's likely you've interacted with microcopy before and it gave you useful information, like how to search for something and secure payment information. It's meant to add to the user experience of visitors on websites, and in this post, we'll get into how it works.</p> \n<p>Microcopy is a part of almost every website. When you visit a website for the first time and a newsletter pops up, the text you see is an example. When you come across a headline describing the product, or find a sentence that gives a web page more context, you're interacting with microcopy.</p> \n<p>But what exactly is microcopy, and how is it helpful?</p> \n<p>When was the last time you tweeted or made a Facebook status? Do you remember the microcopy that shows up before you start typing? This short phrases asks you to complete an action — like typing out what's happening or what's on your mind:</p> \n<p><img alt=\"Microcopy shown on Twitter\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/It%E2%80%99s%20the%20Little%20Things%20How%20To%20Write%20Microcopy.png?width=536&amp;height=122&amp;name=It%E2%80%99s%20the%20Little%20Things%20How%20To%20Write%20Microcopy.png\" title=\"\" width=\"536\" height=\"122\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<p>As someone who's been tweeting for years, I don't even notice the microcopy. But let's say I've just joined Twitter and have no idea how to compose a tweet, or what&nbsp;to tweet. \"What's happening?\" is a useful prompt to help out — I now know I can type what's going on around me and press \"Tweet.\"</p> \n<p>In this case, the microcopy tells the user how to do something and inspires action with a button. Even though it's subtle, the addition of microcopy on Twitter gives instructions and answers questions a new user might have before they can ask them.</p> \n<p>Microcopy gives extra explanation. For instance, if your website offers a niche product, you can use a microcopy headline to give first-time visitors an idea of why your product is valuable. Alternatively, if you're introducing a new product, microcopy can describe it in more detail.</p> \n<p>If you've ever filled in a form, explored a product page, or sourced contact information, you've come across microcopy that supports a brand and its services. For instance, if you forget your login to one of your favorite websites, the microcopy most likely reminded you how to do so.</p> \n<p>Microcopy is part of the user experience. It's a tactic you can use to support the overall story as your brand, as well as describe some of the complexities of your product, right off the bat.</p> \n<p>To produce great microcopy, you need to have a deep understanding of your target audience. Once you know more about them, the questions they might have, and the information they need to know, microcopy can serve as an effective part of your website.</p> \n<p>Let's look at some examples of brands who know how to speak the language of their customers and make use of effective microcopy.</p> \n<h2>Microcopy Examples</h2> \n<p>MIcrocopy can come in a few different forms. It doesn't have to be extremely tiny or fit into a search bar. Sometimes it's bold. It all depends on the copy's intended purpose and the design of the website.</p> \n<p>Let's see how some brands are using microcopy effectively to enhance the user experience.</p> \n<h3>1. HubSpot</h3> \n<p>This microcopy example on HubSpot's homepage explains the product. In two sentences, visitors gain an idea of what HubSpot's tools do, and how it can help them.</p> \n<p>The language is personable and easy to read. In support of the CTA, the microcopy leads into the value of getting started or trying out a demo. It inspires action. <img alt=\"Microcopy on HubSpot\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/It%E2%80%99s%20the%20Little%20Things%20How%20To%20Write%20Microcopy-Jul-17-2020-02-58-52-96-AM.png?width=624&amp;name=It%E2%80%99s%20the%20Little%20Things%20How%20To%20Write%20Microcopy-Jul-17-2020-02-58-52-96-AM.png\" title=\"\" width=\"624\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><em><a href=\"http://hubspot.com\">Image Source</a></em></p> \n<p>Notice how the text isn't necessarily small, either. This is alright if the theme of your website allows for larger text. Microcopy is more about communicating a helpful message to your audience, regardless of text size.</p> \n<h3>2. Wear Your Voice</h3> \n<p>Wear Your Voice is an online publication dedicated to bringing a spotlight to marginalized voices, sparking communication about topical issues, and providing a safe space for audiences to learn.</p> \n<p>This microcopy is what you see on the homepage as part of a newsletter offer. It lets the reader know that they won't receive spam. Not only that, but the microcopy in the space communicates how to receive the newsletters, by entering an email.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"Wear Your Voice microcopy\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/It%E2%80%99s%20the%20Little%20Things%20How%20To%20Write%20Microcopy-2.png?width=624&amp;name=It%E2%80%99s%20the%20Little%20Things%20How%20To%20Write%20Microcopy-2.png\" title=\"\" width=\"624\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><em><a href=\"https://wearyourvoicemag.com/\">Image Source</a></em></p> \n<p>If you want to use microcopy in a subtle way to increase conversions, utilize a strategy that's similar. Include it in a form space or to inform browsers about any concern they may have that would stop them from completing the CTA.</p> \n<h3>3. Honey</h3> \n<p>Honey is an app extension that saves its users money every time they make an online purchase. Because this service is niche, the website provides helpful microcopy about how it works.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"Honey app Microcopy\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/It%E2%80%99s%20the%20Little%20Things%20How%20To%20Write%20Microcopy-Jul-17-2020-02-58-53-09-AM.png?width=434&amp;height=479&amp;name=It%E2%80%99s%20the%20Little%20Things%20How%20To%20Write%20Microcopy-Jul-17-2020-02-58-53-09-AM.png\" title=\"\" width=\"434\" height=\"479\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><em><a href=\"https://www.joinhoney.com/\">Image Source</a></em></p> \n<p>The headers act as an introduction to the thought, and the microcopy supports the steps. This microcopy is organized, but doesn't take up too much space. Additionally, the phrases are short and easy to comprehend.</p> \n<p>For a service that may seem complicated at first, simplified steps are an excellent measure to ensure leads know how Honey can add value to their lives. If your product or service is niche, consider using microcopy to explain how it works in a comprehensible way, like Honey.</p> \n<h3>4. Shea Makery</h3> \n<p>When it comes to branding and brand voice, microcopy is a great asset. Take this example from Shea Makery, a bakery-themed body care ecommerce store. The text used on the site contributes to the overall tone of the brand and ties in a CTA.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"Microcopy from Shea Makery\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/It%E2%80%99s%20the%20Little%20Things%20How%20To%20Write%20Microcopy-3.png?width=624&amp;height=372&amp;name=It%E2%80%99s%20the%20Little%20Things%20How%20To%20Write%20Microcopy-3.png\" title=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"372\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><em><a href=\"https://sheamakery.com/\">Image Source</a></em></p> \n<p>\"So much to choose from, all guilt-free with zero calories!\" Introduces the brand with fun, compelling microcopy. The short, rhyming sentence plays up the whimsical, cheerful atmosphere of the website, and the baking attribution speaks to the overall theme of the company.</p> \n<p>Maybe your business is heavily influenced by a theme, like Shea Makery. If that's the case, microcopy with sensory details, like sight, can influence leads to browse your offerings.</p> \n<h3>5. The Canadian African</h3> \n<p>Rather than have a separate \"About Me\" page, this health food blog uses microcopy for the introduction. On the right panel of the website, The Canadian African, you can see a short description of the site and the person in charge.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"Microcopy on a food blog \" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/It%E2%80%99s%20the%20Little%20Things%20How%20To%20Write%20Microcopy-1.png?width=315&amp;height=569&amp;name=It%E2%80%99s%20the%20Little%20Things%20How%20To%20Write%20Microcopy-1.png\" title=\"\" width=\"315\" height=\"569\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><em><a href=\"https://thecanadianafrican.com/\">Image Source</a></em></p> \n<p>The copy is short and simple, but still tells the reader what they'll find on the site. By adding a photo, above the text, the website becomes more personable. So if you're running a solo venture and want to appeal to your target audience, consider using microcopy to introduce yourself on the homepage.</p> \n<p>We've seen microcopy in action — and how it comes in many different forms. If you're pumped to compose some great copy of your own, that's great! Before you do, make sure you check out these best practices.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>To make microcopy effective, keep in mind these microcopy best practices.</p> \n<h3>1. Understand your audience's needs.</h3> \n<p>One of the keys to writing great microcopy is understanding your audience. If you know what they're looking for when they visit your website, what you write can help guide them. For instance, if you know audiences will want to know how to log in to your website, use microcopy in those fields to tell them how.</p> \n<p>To learn more about your audience and what microcopy will be helpful, refer to your buyer personas. They'll outline the challenges of your ideal customer, so you'll have a clue of how to leverage microcopy. Let's say your persona is the busy marketer looking for an all-in-one CRM — your product page microcopy can allude to that challenge, like \"Our tools take the stresses away from what you love doing.\"</p> \n<p>Alternatively, you can run a few <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/heat-map?_ga=2.263827269.830048207.1594954727-940436819.1565181751\">heatmap</a>&nbsp;tests for your website to gain insight about where your audience is clicking the most. Could the areas that aren't getting the most traffic benefit from copy that speaks the customer's language?</p> \n<h3>2. Focus on brief phrasing.</h3> \n<p>As marketers, know that one of the \"don'ts\" of website design is to avoid loads of text. After all, very few of us want to read a novel on a website that sells computer software. So when you're writing microcopy, make it brief.</p> \n<p>The purpose of microcopy is to guide, inform, or support. Typically, it's no longer than one sentence. This is because it's not supposed to be the star of your website, but rather, a helpful addition.</p> \n<p>When you visit a website for the first time and immediately see an offer, notice the microcopy. Does it have a quippy, witty phrase that persuades you to complete the form? That's an example of accurately leveraging microcopy to your advantage.</p> \n<h3>3. Make your copy actionable.</h3> \n<p>A great way to use microcopy is to get customers to complete an action on your website. We've briefly talked about how offer and form microcopy can be useful for conversion.</p> \n<p>In addition to forms and offers, microcopy can be used in ads, captions, and on product pages. It could persuade audiences to take the intended action. If you use microcopy in tandem with a CTA, for example, you could make an ad incredibly effective — tell the audiences what the benefit will be after engaging.</p> \n<p>If there's areas on your website that could benefit from an actionable phrase that's too long for a CTA button, consider making it microcopy instead. That way, it can support the CTA without adding too much text.</p> \n<h3>4. Add in your brand voice.</h3> \n<p>Another great use for microcopy is to give more definition to your brand. Maybe you find your website comes off slightly impersonal, but you don't want to crowd pages with extra body text. Try using microcopy to fill in that gap.</p> \n<p>Because microcopy isn't a headline or body text, there's more freedom to use it to support your company's mission, vision, and beliefs. Communicate with your audience in a personable way in a short phrase, and you'll have a higher chance of building a solid customer relationship.</p> \n<p>This tactic will make your web pages more inviting. It'll spark intrigue with your target audience, and let them know what truly sets your company apart from competitors.</p> \n<h3>5. Be careful with going overboard.</h3> \n<p>As we've talked about, too much text isn't appealing. If leads find there's too much to read on your site, they might become disinterested and click to another. The same is true with microcopy.</p> \n<p>Microcopy works best when it supports other text or inspires action. It should serve a purpose and be used sparingly. An overload of microcopy can be too hard to read — remember, the text is usually small.</p> \n<p>If you're worried you're using too much microcopy, try running an A/B test for your web pages. That way, you can determine the winner based on audience behavior.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fwriting-great-microcopy&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 16 Jul 2020 21:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/It%E2%80%99s%20the%20Little%20Things%20How%20To%20Write%20Microcopy-4.png?width=624&height=196&name=It%E2%80%99s%20the%20Little%20Things%20How%20To%20Write%20Microcopy-4.png","linkMd5":"002c6b656aef2ea240d0db4cb76d6357","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn73@2020_5/2020-07-30/1596118301925_dee6e3c5ad8757ef.webp","author":"Kayla Carmicheal","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/It%E2%80%99s%20the%20Little%20Things%20How%20To%20Write%20Microcopy-4.png?width=624&height=196&name=It%E2%80%99s%20the%20Little%20Things%20How%20To%20Write%20Microcopy-4.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn73@2020_5/2020-07-30/1596118301925_dee6e3c5ad8757ef.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/It%E2%80%99s%20the%20Little%20Things%20How%20To%20Write%20Microcopy.png?width=536&height=122&name=It%E2%80%99s%20the%20Little%20Things%20How%20To%20Write%20Microcopy.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn57@2020_2/2020-07-30/1596118306315_9d82afcb9905db1f.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/It%E2%80%99s%20the%20Little%20Things%20How%20To%20Write%20Microcopy-Jul-17-2020-02-58-52-96-AM.png?width=624&name=It%E2%80%99s%20the%20Little%20Things%20How%20To%20Write%20Microcopy-Jul-17-2020-02-58-52-96-AM.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn69@2020_5/2020-07-30/1596118305217_7b77897731241cc6.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/It%E2%80%99s%20the%20Little%20Things%20How%20To%20Write%20Microcopy-2.png?width=624&name=It%E2%80%99s%20the%20Little%20Things%20How%20To%20Write%20Microcopy-2.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn61@2020_4/2020-07-30/1596118311293_834d92c010398990.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/It%E2%80%99s%20the%20Little%20Things%20How%20To%20Write%20Microcopy-Jul-17-2020-02-58-53-09-AM.png?width=434&height=479&name=It%E2%80%99s%20the%20Little%20Things%20How%20To%20Write%20Microcopy-Jul-17-2020-02-58-53-09-AM.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn78@2020_6/2020-07-30/1596118312965_68d5c35831fa4a32.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/It%E2%80%99s%20the%20Little%20Things%20How%20To%20Write%20Microcopy-3.png?width=624&height=372&name=It%E2%80%99s%20the%20Little%20Things%20How%20To%20Write%20Microcopy-3.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn41@2020_4/2020-07-30/1596118309914_39fee62a47a2e7a8.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/It%E2%80%99s%20the%20Little%20Things%20How%20To%20Write%20Microcopy-1.png?width=315&height=569&name=It%E2%80%99s%20the%20Little%20Things%20How%20To%20Write%20Microcopy-1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn89@2020_4/2020-07-30/1596118310463_b12de36469148383.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fwriting-great-microcopy&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn77@2020_1/2020-07-30/1596118312121_28b20bbff415ec5d.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-07-30 22:11:41","updatedTime":"2020-07-30 14:11:41","title":"What Is a Whitepaper? [FAQs]","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-is-a-whitepaper-examples-for-business","description":"<p>The definition of a whitepaper varies heavily from industry to industry, which can be a little confusing for marketers looking to create one for their business.</p> \n<p>The old-school definition comes from politics, where it means a legislative document explaining and supporting a particular political solution.</p> \n<p> In tech, a whitepaper usually describes a theory behind a new piece of technology. Even a business whitepaper can serve a variety of uses and audiences -- some more product-focused than others. And although it is put together like an ebook, the two are written quite differently.</p> \n<h3></h3> \n<p>We're here to arm you with the <em>best</em> definition of a whitepaper in the context of business and what to do (and not do) as you create one. This article covers:&nbsp;</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"#what-is-whitepaper\">What is a whitepaper?</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"#how-to-write-whitepaper\">How to write a whitepaper</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"#whitepaper-examples\">Whitepaper examples</a></li> \n</ul> \n<a></a> \n<h2>What Is a Whitepaper?</h2> \n<p><strong>A whitepaper is a persuasive, authoritative,</strong><strong style=\"font-size: inherit;\"> in-depth report on a specific topic that presents a problem and provides a solution.</strong></p> \n<p>Marketers create whitepapers to educate their audience about a particular issue, or explain and promote a particular methodology. They're advanced problem-solving guides. Typically, whitepapers require at least an email address for download (usually they require information more than that), making them great for capturing leads.</p> \n<h3>What Isn't a Whitepaper?</h3> \n<p>A product pitch.</p> \n<p>Although Investopedia <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/whitepaper.asp\">defines</a> a whitepaper as \"an informational document issued by a company to promote or highlight the features of a solution, product, or service,\" be warned that overtly shilling your own stuff could turn off your readers.</p> \n<p>The goal of a whitepaper is to inform and persuade based on facts and evidence, not tell the world why people need to buy your product right now.</p> \n<h3>How Are Whitepapers Different From Blog Posts and Ebooks?</h3> \n<p>Speaking of what a whitepaper <em>isn't</em> ... if you're looking for a quick and interactive way to present your value to the industry, a whitepaper is not your only option. There are also ebooks and blog posts -- both of which have various differences from a whitepaper.</p> \n<p>What really set these products apart are the size, appearance, and time commitment of each one. Whereas writing blog posts and ebooks can take anywhere between a few hours and a few weeks, a good whitepaper can take between a few weeks and a few months to write and polish. They're less flashy, much more serious in tone, and more heavily researched than blog posts and ebooks.</p> \n<p>Let me show you a comparison. The set below is one of our own ebook templates (<a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/13-free-customisable-ebook-templates\">which you can get for free here</a>). It's a thorough but simple read:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/free%20ebook%20template%20cover.png?width=264&amp;name=free%20ebook%20template%20cover.png\" style=\"width: 264px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" alt=\"Cover of a free ebook template offered by HubSpot\" title=\"Cover of a free ebook template offered by HubSpot\" width=\"264\">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/free%20ebook%20template%20page.png?width=274&amp;name=free%20ebook%20template%20page.png\" style=\"width: 274px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" alt=\"Page from a free ebook template offered by HubSpot\" title=\"Page from a free ebook template offered by HubSpot\" width=\"274\"></p> \n<p>Now, here is a whitepaper based on our latest research on emerging tech for small to mid-sized businesses (a great report -- <a href=\"https://research.hubspot.com/emerging-tech-for-smbs\">see the web version here</a>). You can see how much detail whitepapers can go into, both in text and in its images:</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/emerging%20tech%20for%20business%20whitepaper%20cover.png?width=278&amp;name=emerging%20tech%20for%20business%20whitepaper%20cover.png\" style=\"width: 278px; margin: 0px auto;\" width=\"278\" alt=\"hubspot research whitepaper cover that reads: &quot;a practical approach to emerging tech for smbs&quot;\">&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/emerging%20tech%20for%20business%20whitepaper%20page.png?width=276&amp;name=emerging%20tech%20for%20business%20whitepaper%20page.png\" style=\"width: 276px; margin: 0px auto;\" width=\"276\" alt=\"hubspot research whitepaper internal page that is about why blockchain matters\"><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Images via <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/file:///Users/brbecker/Downloads/HubSpot%20Emerging%20Tech%20Report%20(1).pdf\">HubSpot Research [PDF]</a></span></p> \n<p>Ebooks and whitepapers can start on the same template. But ultimately, whitepapers are the academic papers of marketing content. Readers expect a high degree of expertise backed by solid research that is fully documented by references.</p> \n<p>Ebooks, on the other hand, are often extensions of a subject you cover regularly on a blog. They can come out of diligent research, but they appeal to a wider audience when unpacking a business subject.</p> \n<p>You can imagine this makes them kind of boring in comparison -- truthfully, most people don't actually <em>want</em> to read whitepapers, but they do it anyway to build their knowledge of an operation they need more insight on before making their next move.</p> \n<p>For this reason, they tend to be particularly detailed and informative, authoritative, and written by industry experts. And these qualities can make some decision makers feel better about a future purchase.</p> \n<h3>What Makes a Good Whitepaper?</h3> \n<p>Technically, there are no minimum requirements for whitepapers. Anyone can call anything a whitepaper -- this doesn't mean you should, though. Without some boundaries on what is and what isn't a whitepaper, we risk confusing our audience and losing credibility. Here's what an A+ whitepaper looks like:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Length: </strong>No fewer than six pages, including illustrations, charts, and references. Can be upwards of 50 if the topic requires that much detail. (Chances are, it won't.)</li> \n <li><strong>Structure:</strong> There is usually a title page, table of contents, short executive summary (optional but helpful), introduction, several pages educating the reader about the problem, several pages hypothesizing a solution, several pages offering an example of a company that used that solution to achieve results, and a conclusion.</li> \n <li><strong>Density: </strong>Denser than an ebook. Whitepapers aren't usually easy to skim -- in fact, readers usually need to read them over more than once to get every morsel of information out of it.</li> \n <li><strong>Format: </strong>PDF in portrait orientation (8.5\" by 11\").</li> \n <li><strong>Style:</strong> Professional, serious, well written, and well edited. I'd recommend hiring a graphic designer to design page layout, images, fonts, and colors as well.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>Whitepaper Examples for Lead Generation</h3> \n<p>So, if whitepapers are so boring, why do marketers create them? Well, they're a great resource for your prospects and sales team, and they help you build credibility and trust with your readers. Also, people who choose to download whitepapers often are further into the <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/19022/How-to-Leverage-the-5-Stages-of-the-Customer-Buying-Cycle-for-More-Sales.aspx\">customer buying cycle</a>.</p> \n<p>With that in mind, here are two use cases for a whitepaper:</p> \n<h4>A Technical Case Study</h4> \n<p>It's been said that case studies, like ebooks, are very different from whitepapers. However, some case studies are long enough that they're best packaged as whitepapers themselves.</p> \n<p>A case study is essentially the story of a customer's success reaching a goal as a result of their partnership with another party. This success is best conveyed through certain metrics the customer has agreed to be measured on. And depending on how technical or complex the service is that they received, the more research and detail other potential customers will want to see as they continue their buyer's journey.</p> \n<p>Therefore, case study-based whitepapers can be a terrific way of demonstrating thought leadership on a dense concept through a real-world example of how this concept helped someone else succeed.</p> \n<h4>A Reference Guide</h4> \n<p>Imagine you work for a company that sells kitchen cleaning equipment to restaurants and you write a whitepaper about the maintenance and inspection of commercial kitchens.</p> \n<p>That whitepaper is probably chock full of information about legal requirements for exhaust systems, cooking equipment, and cleanliness documentation that could put even the biggest kitchen maintenance enthusiast to sleep if read cover-to-cover.</p> \n<p>But it also serves as an incredibly useful reference for restaurant owners who want to know how to maintain their kitchens to pass inspection. Once they know how clean they need to keep their kitchens, they'll likely buy some expensive cleaning equipment from you because they see you as a helpful, detail-oriented, credible source.</p> \n<p>Many people create whitepapers for this purpose -- a resource that their leads can take with them to become better at their trade. Ideally, the better they become, the more qualified they are to work with the organization that gave them the whitepaper.</p> \n<p>Now that you know the purpose of whitepapers and how they differ from ebooks, it's time to get started in creating your own. With the above best practices in mind, here's the approach you can take to produce an excellent whitepaper for your audience:&nbsp;</p> \n<a></a> \n<div class=\"hsg-featured-snippet\"> \n <h2>How to Write a Whitepaper</h2> \n <ol> \n  <li>Identify your audience's pain.</li> \n  <li>Do your research.</li> \n  <li>Create an outline.</li> \n  <li>Put pen to paper and flesh out your outline.</li> \n  <li>Use imagery to support your points.</li> \n  <li>Get feedback.</li> \n  <li>Invest in the formatting and design.</li> \n </ol> \n</div> \n<h3>1. Identify your audience's pain.&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>While you're a subject matter expert in a unique position to provide content, you must consider your audience and what is going on in their lives. By creating a whitepaper that addresses (and solves) for their needs, you'll better be able to generate demand for your whitepaper.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>To do this, consider <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/make-my-persona\">creating a buyer persona</a>. This activity will help you put yourself in their shoes. Then, you'll want to consider what kind of information would attract them, how they'd use the information, and how it would solve their pain or problem.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>2. Do your research.&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>Whitepapers are informational in nature, and you'll want to determine how to provide information your audience can't get elsewhere. You can do that by:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Running an original study/survey</li> \n <li>Putting together unique case studies</li> \n <li>Detailing a unique process or project</li> \n</ul> \n<p>If you're unable to do your own research, try drawing statistics from government and/or survey organizations and analyzing them in a unique way (and make sure you cite your sources).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>3. Create an outline.&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>Because whitepapers are long-form in nature, an outline can help organize your thoughts. Consider sketching out your topic in the following format:&nbsp;</p> \n<ol> \n <li><strong>Introduction and Synopsis</strong> - Introducing the topic of the whitepaper, explaining why it's important (from the standpoint of the audience), and what the whitepaper sets to do, convey, or solve.&nbsp;</li> \n <li><strong>Overview</strong> - Defining some some of the key terms you intend to use, detailing the variables or parameters involved, and summarizing what you'll discuss.&nbsp;</li> \n <li><strong>Body</strong> - Laying out all the key points and highlights you'll hit.&nbsp;</li> \n <li><strong>Conclusion</strong> - Explaining the key take-aways from the body and any action items the reader should take.</li> \n</ol> \n<h3>4. Put pen to paper and flesh out your outline.&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>Using an informational and fact-based tone, begin expanding on the ideas you have by using the outline as a guide. In addition, each paragraph should contribute to the overall goal of the piece.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>5. Use imagery to support your points.&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>Because whitepapers go deep on research and analysis, visuals such as charts, graphs, and tables can help you present information in a visually interesting way and make the paper easier to read.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>6. Get feedback.&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>It's critical to present the best write-up you can for your readers. The higher quality it is, the more authority you'll have in your audience's eyes. Get feedback from someone you trust to catch typos or other issues with readability.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>7. Invest in the formatting and design.&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>While it's not necessary to get too flashy with it, color, layout, and imagery goes a long way to make your whitepaper appealing.&nbsp;</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>Whitepaper Examples</h2> \n<p>To provide even more inspiration, here are modern examples of whitepapers that are emblematic of great whitepaper execution (and why):</p> \n<h3>1. <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/state-of-marketing\">Not Another State of Marketing Report</a>, HubSpot</h3> \n<p>HubSpot does an amazing job every year compiling data from experts and partners to convey modern trends in the marketing landscape.

By providing a methodology in the beginning, Google aims to give the reader the tools to think through the power of AI as it can be applied to their business. Then, the whitepaper dives into more technical information for advanced readers.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/google-whitepaper-example.jpg?width=400&amp;name=google-whitepaper-example.jpg\" alt=\"google whitepaper example: cover that reads &quot;google cloud's AI adoption framework&quot;\" width=\"400\" style=\"width: 400px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/whitepapers\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<h3>4. <a href=\"https://cmap.amp.vg/web/c1qxwi3hzxffv\">Employees and Cybersecurity</a>, Excedeo</h3> \n<p>Excedo aims to educate about the security risks that employees may unknowingly pose to businesses when improperly trained.

As we find ourselves more socially distant from one another, we’re <a href=\"https://www.nbc26.com/news/local-news/pandemic-brings-families-closer-together\">connecting more than ever</a> with friends and family. And as <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/americas/which-small-businesses-are-most-vulnerable-to-covid-19-and-when\">growth has slowed</a> for many companies, their digital transformation has accelerated. Dramatically.</p> \n<p>Companies in nearly every industry have urgently adopted remote tools to allow them to support employees working from home. Millions of marketers have quickly signed up to automation software to help them move their entire marketing strategy online. And brick-and-mortar retailers have hastily acquired website management systems to enable them to spin up ecommerce sites.</p> \n<p>Plans for gradual, carefully managed digital transformation have been torn asunder by the pandemic, and the changes that many leaders thought would take years to implement have taken place in a matter of weeks. Entire industries are now waking up in a digitally transformed world awash with new opportunities ... and unknowns.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Is a remote workforce a threat to productivity or a boon for hiring? Is a fully online marketing strategy going to bring companies and customers closer together, or drive them further apart? Are rapidly adopted tech tools going to stimulate internal alignment or drive a wedge between teams?</p> \n<p>These are the questions that companies are asking themselves as they rewrite their go-to-market strategies and charge headlong into the new economic era. The answers will largely depend on whether they welcome the tides of change or attempt to row against them. Because, with change always comes opportunity, and the businesses that view this period of upheaval as a chance to create efficient new processes, upskill employees, and better serve their customers are the ones most likely to thrive in the coming years.</p> \n<p>To help businesses navigate their digital transformation journey with success, we’ve put together a list of five key ways in which go-to-market strategies are changing, along with advice on how to adapt to each.</p> \n<h3><strong>1. Outside Selling ➜ Inside Selling</strong></h3> \n<p>The pandemic has turned outside sales teams into inside sales teams overnight. And while some companies may view this change as temporary, most will witness first hand the benefits that come with inside selling and commit long-term to the model.</p> \n<p>In the digitally transformed world, prospects and decision-makers are less likely to be located in the same office — or even in the same territory — making it all the more difficult for outside salespeople to arrange meetings. Inside selling, however, gives salespeople the opportunity to connect with prospects at any time, from any location.</p> \n<p>Tools like live chat, 1:1 asynchronous video, and sequences — which allow sellers to schedule personalized follow-up emails to prospects — are now available as standard with many <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/sales\">sales software</a> products. These features enable salespeople to adapt how they sell to the way prospects want to buy and allow them to increase their productivity without losing the personal connection that comes with outside selling. In fact, inside sales teams make <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/inside-vs-outside-sales\">43% more phone calls</a>, leave 10% more voicemails, and send 9% more emails than organizations predominantly made up of outside sales people.</p> \n<p>On top of that, <a href=\"https://transaction.agency/ecommerce-statistics/85-percent-of-consumers-conduct-online-research-before-making-a-purchase-online/\">85% of consumers</a> now conduct online research before making a purchase decision, meaning salespeople’s time is better spent building relationships and providing prospects with helpful information online rather than placing the majority of their focus on running in-person demos.</p> \n<p>To successfully adapt to an inside sales model, companies should seek out sales software that’s user-friendly enough to allow their salespeople to get started quickly, while also powerful enough to provide them with a centralized view of customer data — an essential ingredient to delivering a personalized experience to prospects, even without meeting in-person. Sales leaders should also provide training to their teams on how to run effective demos online and set up webcams in a way that’s professional without being impersonal. According to <a href=\"https://www.gong.io/blog/how-to-turn-a-field-sales-rep-into-an-inside-sales-rep/\">Gong</a>, using a webcam in sales calls increases the likelihood of closing a deal by an eye-catching 41%.</p> \n<h3><strong>2. Offline Marketing ➜ Online Marketing</strong></h3> \n<p>If there is one image that illustrates the fact the marketing world is moving from offline to online during the pandemic, it’s that of empty billboards. From <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/business/media/ads-commercials-coronavirus.html\">Tokyo</a> to <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/jer1961/49820126792\">Toronto</a>, outdoor advertising canvases that were once in high demand have been left blank as marketers pour all of their resources into online channels. And in most industries, it’s likely to remain that way.</p> \n<p>When a marketing strategy is fully online, it enables marketers to manage their budgets and strategies by metrics. Everything from webpage traffic and email open rates to social media engagement and digital ad ROI can be measured accurately, giving marketers a deep insight into which channels are the most effective at engaging customers. It also allows marketers to keep pace with rapid shifts in consumer behavior and adjust messaging and budgets in a matter of hours — something that takes weeks, or even months, to do with offline channels like TV and outdoor advertising.</p> \n<p>Never have these benefits been more visible than in recent months. As many offline channels have gone quiet during the pandemic, online engagement between consumers and companies has reached record heights. According to <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/covid-19-benchmark-data-retro1\">HubSpot data</a>, website site traffic increased by 16% from Q1 to Q2, and marketing email open rates were 18% above pre-COVID-19 levels by the beginning of Q3. Companies that were already invested in these channels have not only been able to stay engaged with customers throughout the current crisis, they have been able to quickly adjust the tone of their messaging to reflect the times and communicate important information to their audiences in a timely manner.</p> \n<p>Companies that are embracing fully online marketing strategies for the first time should be cautious, however, to not open up too many new digital channels all at once. Doing so could overwhelm marketing teams as they’re coming to terms with new tools and tactics, and create a disjointed experience for customers. Instead, marketers should prioritize a small number of new tactics, set goals for each, and implement a system to measure progress. For example, instead of setting up accounts on every social media channel at once, which could be difficult to manage, marketers should choose one or two platforms that suit their brand and seek to build an engaged audience there before branching out. Similarly, teams seeking to implement an email marketing strategy for the first time should choose software that includes analytics features like A/B testing in order to closely monitor what’s resonating with audiences.</p> \n<h3><strong>3. Traditional Customer Service ➜ Self-Service</strong></h3> \n<p>During the pandemic, the volume of customer-initiated chat interactions has increased by <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/covid-19-benchmark-data-retro1\">45%</a>, and self-service options like this will go from being a “nice to have” to a “must have” in the eyes of consumers in the digitally transformed world.</p> \n<p>When a business empowers its customers to self-serve, everyone wins. Automated chat, for example, helps customers find solutions to issues more quickly than if they had to email or call a helpline, while also freeing up customer service staff to work on more complex customer issues. Businesses that had a chatbot on their website prior to the pandemic were well-positioned to manage the increased volume of queries that accompanied the crisis, and from here on, customers will expect to be able to have their questions answered in minutes without having to pick up a phone. After all, according to <a href=\"https://d16cvnquvjw7pr.cloudfront.net/images/blog/Infographic/zd_search_customer_self_service_inforgraphic.jpg\">Nuance Enterprise</a>, 67% of customers prefer to use self-service options instead of speaking with a company representative.</p> \n<p>Automated chat is just one of a number of ways businesses can provide self-service options to their customers. Companies should also consider building a knowledge base — a collection of resources that offer guidance on common queries — and creating product training videos for new customers. HubSpot’s version of this, HubSpot Academy, saw <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/covid-19-benchmark-data-edition3\">traffic double</a> between March and May, highlighting the growing desire of customers to engage with high-quality, on-demand video that enables them to become more skilled with the products they use.</p> \n<h3><strong>4. Funnel ➜ Flywheel</strong></h3> \n<p>According to research conducted by HubSpot in the midst of the pandemic, consumers cite “customer care” as the single greatest influence on their sentiment towards a company. As more companies come to see customer experience as the key to growth in the post-pandemic world, many will <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/our-flywheel\">abandon the funnel model in favor of the flywheel</a>.</p> \n<p>While the funnel focuses exclusively on <em>acquiring</em> customers, the flywheel is built to <em>delight</em> them over the course of their entire journey with a company. When companies embrace the flywheel, it enables them to place the customer at the center of everything, from how they attract and engage customers to how they help them achieve long-term success. Thinking of the customer journey in this way helps companies to identify the areas of their business in which they can remove friction and apply force in the name of delivering an experience so delightful, customers can’t help but tell others.</p> \n<p>There are three key steps to take when adopting the flywheel model.</p> \n<p>Firstly, companies should identify their core business metrics so that they can monitor progress and identify areas for improvement. Secondly, they should look for the parts of the flywheel in which they can add more force, in other words, the aspects of their business that have the greatest impact on key metrics. At HubSpot for example, we increased force by introducing a self-purchase option for prospects, expanding our knowledge base, and creating a dedicated customer marketing team to ensure that outgoing communications were consistent.</p> \n<p>As a third step, companies should identify points of friction that counteract force in their flywheel. A good starting point for companies seeking to reduce friction is to analyze the experience a customer has when they move from being the responsibility of the sales team to the customer success or service team. Does their new point of contact at the company have historical information about their purchase experience and pain points? If not, there could be an opportunity to remove friction by introducing a process or system that shares new customer information between different teams.</p> \n<h3><strong>5. Bloated Tech Stack ➜ Lean Tech Stack</strong></h3> \n<p>As companies accelerate their digital transformation, many are rapidly adopting a vast array of new technologies. The ample choice of powerful tools available at companies’ fingertips is unquestionably a positive thing, but there are potential downsides to consider. For example, when a businesses rushes to move its entire operation online — as many are now having to do — they run the risk of taking on a host of disparate tools that don’t work well together, leaving them with a bloated tech stack that creates data silos, increases administrative work, and makes it difficult for teams to stay aligned.</p> \n<p>In the digitally transformed world, we will see an increase in companies seeking to shed their tech debt and construct a lean suite of tools that enables them to move quickly in the post-pandemic era.</p> \n<p>When building a tech stack, companies should select a system that gives all internal teams access to a single source of truth on customer data. Without this, customer-facing staff will be working off different information, making it monumentally difficult to deliver the type of seamless, contextual experience that customers now expect. Additionally, businesses should consider how easy or difficult it is to integrate additional tools with their platform of choice. In order to keep a tech stack lean, companies need the freedom to build it in a way that suits their unique needs.</p> \n<h3><strong>The Great Acceleration</strong></h3> \n<p>The 1930s brought with it the Great Depression. Ten years ago, the Great Recession took hold. As an optimist, I hope this time will be remembered by businesses as “The Great Acceleration” — a time when companies in every industry and region underwent a rapid digital transformation that defined a new economic era.</p> \n<p>The go-to-market playbook for this era will be one made up of inside selling, online marketing, and self-service options for customers, underpinned by a flywheel mindset, and powered by a lean tech stack that enables them to keep pace with customer expectations. Companies that embrace these new strategies are the ones most likely to navigate these times with success and thrive in the post-pandemic world. And it is my hope that in years to come, businesses will look back on The Great Acceleration and remember it not for the economic stagnation that took hold, but rather for the rapid progress that took flight.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fwaking-up-in-a-digitally-transformed-world&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 20 Jul 2020 11:45:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/digital-transformed-world.jpg#keepProtocol","linkMd5":"1edcfa4f16f34c2f10d9933c6ba5a134","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn21@2020_3/2020-07-30/1596118303767_5543045bab522c35.webp","metaImg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/digital-transformed-world.jpg#keepProtocol","author":"manderson@hubspot.com (Meghan Keaney Anderson)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fwaking-up-in-a-digitally-transformed-world&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn29@2020_1/2020-07-30/1596118306495_8db86d2fdad043e1.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-07-30 22:11:40","updatedTime":"2020-07-30 14:11:40","title":"8 Modern Tips for Marketing to Millennials","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/marketing-to-millennials","description":"<p>You've seen the articles lamenting the death of certain industries and changing consumer attitudes, all paying tribute (negatively or positively) to a certain generation born in the 80s and 90s. It seems that journalists love to write about Millennials and marketers love to analyze them. Why, though?&nbsp;</p>  \n<p>Boomers hold <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/this-depressing-chart-shows-the-jaw-dropping-wealth-gap-between-millennials-and-boomers-2019-12-04\">57% of the wealth in the U.S.</a> and are at peak buying power. With that in mind, is there a reason we never seem to stop hearing about Millennials?</p> \n<p></p> \n<h2>Why Millennials Are Important to Marketers</h2> \n<p>As Millennials enter their 30s and 40s, often with student loans or young children, they haven't yet reached their full buying power compared to GenXers or Boomers. Nonetheless, there are multiple reasons to pay attention to this generation:&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>1. Millennials are the most lucrative market.</h3> \n<p>Even though as a group, they haven't reached their full buying power yet, their buying power eclipses that of other generations. They make up 25% of the population, and with an estimated annual buying power of <a href=\"http://www.millennialmarketing.com/who-are-millennials/\">over a trillion dollars</a>, they are the most lucrative market. Plain and simple: Nearly every marketer today is making Generation Y a priority – or at least working to understand what drives and delights this instrumental group.</p> \n<h3>2. Millennials switch brands.&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>Millennial market research performed by Daymon Worldwide suggests that only 29% of Millennials will buy the same brand, which is a much lower brand loyalty score compared to previous generations.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>This indicates that brands must do more to attract and keep Millennial customers, leading to the need for constant innovation on marketers' and service teams' parts.</p> \n<h3>3. Millennials are tech-savvy.&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/09/09/us-generations-technology-use/\">Pew Research</a>, \"Almost all Millennials (nearly 100%) now say they use the internet.\" Having grown up with or only slightly before the internet, Millennials are not shy about using technology. This is attractive to brands who sell technology or use technology to sell.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>4. Millennials use devices.&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>Pew Research also found that 9 out of 10 Millennials have a smart phone. With widespread device ownership and use comes a higher likelihood of consuming web content, which gives rise to different modes of marketing.</p> \n<p>One key element that justifies Millennial domination of the marketplace is the fact this new marketing style – which we’ll delve into in just a minute – isn’t just a fad. Here, we’ll discuss important tactics for marketing to the demographic of the hour and explain why these tactics are lasting ones.</p> \n<div class=\"hsg-featured-snippet\"> \n <h2>How to Market to Millennials</h2> \n <ol> \n  <li>Create authentic content.</li> \n  <li>Ditch outbound marketing methods.</li> \n  <li>Be informative with inbound marketing, instead.</li> \n  <li>Put them first and connect organically.</li> \n  <li>Market with intention rather than latching on to gimmicky marketing fads.</li> \n  <li>Be open to collaboration.</li> \n  <li>Push the convenient and practical side.</li> \n  <li>Lean into the fun and the experiential.</li> \n </ol> \n</div> \n<h3>1. Create authentic content.</h3> \n<p>Millennials are spending an average of <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/topics/2576/us-millennials-internet-usage-and-online-shopping/\">242 minutes online or using apps per day</a>, and they’re craving content-driven media. They’re scouring websites, blogs, and social media because they feel empowered by all of the remarkable content they’re discovering. They’re also sharing, liking, pinning, tweeting, snapping, forwarding, and commenting on all of their findings to impart this sense of empowerment to the online community. So, what makes this type of content really resonate with this group? Millennials trust what they feel is authentic.</p> \n<p>Interacting in a user-centric environment is what engages them, as <a href=\"https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/survey-finds-consumers-crave-authenticity-and-user-generated-content-deli/511360/\">90% of Millennials say authenticity is important to them</a> when deciding which brands they support. Today, young shoppers’ attitudes and behavior are largely inspired by people they know in person or online, or even strangers who share their interests on social networks. Millennials carry these “advisors” with them on their smartphones and everywhere they go. They trust relevant, authentic opinions from real product users they can relate to. In fact, <a href=\"https://stackla.com/resources/blog/42-statistics-about-user-generated-content-you-need-to-know/\">Millennials believe that user-generated content is 35% more memorable than other media</a>.</p> \n<p>For brands that want to successfully reach Gen Y-ers, they simply need to speak their language. People ages 18 to 34 will perk up when hearing or reading words that could have come from the mouths of their peers, as these messages warrant comfort&nbsp;and trust. When you offer your audience content they would proudly share with others, you’re building a real brand-consumer relationship.</p> \n<h3>2. Ditch outbound marketing methods.</h3> \n<p>Millennials want to feel connected and involved when it comes to their purchases, and traditional marketing does not encourage this. Outbound marketing methods<strong>, </strong>like magazine ads, direct mail campaigns, and radio spots, do not impress Millennials. In the mind of a young consumer, these campaigns are impersonal and company-focused, filled with logos and void of any real substance. This generation demands more customer-driven, personalized marketing. Only 1% of Millennials say a compelling advertisement can build trust (<a href=\"https://www.iab.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Crowdtap_TheMarketersGuidetoUGC.pdf\">Crowdtap</a>).</p> \n<p>That’s why these young consumers do a lot of their research via blogs, forums, and YouTube videos. Odds are that an intrusive ad isn’t going to be a deciding factor. While such ads may be relevant to the person’s search history and may put the idea in the their head, seeing it wasn’t their choice. Millennials feel empowered to make their own online choices – which are usually inspired by their peers or other authentic content.</p> \n<h3>3. Be informative with inbound marketing, instead.</h3> \n<p>Millennials support businesses that are dedicated to improving their customers’ lives with informative content. Rather than product and service listings, Millennials want e-books, whitepapers, blog posts, videos, and other how-to information – and that’s inbound marketing. They appreciate thought leadership and expertise, so this is your company’s chance to provide killer content that ranks highly in Google and show young consumers that you’re the industry buff.</p> \n<p>Mac Cosmetics’ YouTube page is a great example of how brands can offer their audience how-to’s from the experts. People want helpful guidance, and when your company takes the time to provide that, they appreciate it and respect what you stand for. Mac is giving young viewers exactly what they want, where they’ll find it. <a href=\"https://www.theshelf.com/the-blog/youtube-habits\">54% of Millennials check YouTube daily</a>,&nbsp;so utilizing YouTube is perfect. A Millennial makeup lover is much more likely to tell her friends to check out Mac’s makeup tutorials than show her friends a print ad of Mac talking about how great they are.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/465783/3.png\" alt=\"3\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<h3>4. Put them first and connect organically.</h3> \n<p>Millennials want to feel like your content was created with their interest (not their wallet) in mind. When this is the case, they are more organically introduced to purchasing your products or services. Without ever being “pushy,” your educational content helps build strong brand-consumer relationships. People appreciate honesty, and brands with transparent campaigns&nbsp;win.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/465783/hqdefault.jpg\" alt=\"hqdefault\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><br>And, what’s more transparent than encapsulating the spontaneous adventures of travelers in hostels – with skinny dipping? <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/hostelworld\">Hostelworld’s Meet the World</a> advertising campaign, which features genuine travelers that are strangers upon meeting and share a once in a lifetime adventure of skinny dipping, celebrates real travelers in real places who crave adventures, not souvenirs. This successfully speaks to Millennials because it screams “Live!” instead of “Buy!” – and that’s something that’ll stick with them. Most young people would rather have an unforgettable experience than seek out luxury, and Hostelworld gets that.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>5. Market with intention rather than latching on to gimmicky marketing fads.</h3> \n<p>If you think content marketing is a passing trend, think again! Here are some key examples of <a href=\"http://todaymade.com/blog/history-of-content-marketing/\">how content marketing has succeeded over the years</a>:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>1895:</strong> John Deere introduces&nbsp;<em>The Furrow</em>,&nbsp;a free publication with tons of farming tips and techniques to help farmers become more profitable. Today, it’s available in more than 40 countries and in 12 different languages.</li> \n <li><strong>1900:</strong> Michelin Tires released a 400-page auto maintenance guide with everyday drivers in mind, and also included travel tips. 35,000 copies were distributed free of charge before the company started selling the manual for a profit.</li> \n <li><strong>1904:</strong> Jell-O circulated free copies of its own cookbook, highlighting creative ways to use the unique product. In 2 years, the company saw sales increase to over $1 million annually.</li> \n <li><strong>1966:</strong> Nike released a 19-page booklet titled&nbsp;Jogging. It was filled with advice on enjoying running as a recreational activity, including posture and striking tips. This brought running, as a sport, to America, and it never once mentioned a Nike shoe.</li> \n</ul> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/465783/5.jpg\" alt=\"5\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><br>We know that Millennial consumers value awesome, authentic content – so it looks like content marketing isn’t going away anytime soon. The inbound methodology, with its emphasis on strong and consistent content creation, is not a fad and will continue to win over your ideal customers.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>6. Be open to collaboration.&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>Today, Millennials are interested in having a say and becoming product co-creators. In fact, <a href=\"http://millennialbranding.com/2015/millennial-consumer-study/\">42 percent said they are interested in helping companies develop future products and services</a>. In our society, companies usually create products and hope that their target market will consume them. When it comes to Millennials, they want to be more involved with how products get created. So, companies that enable them to be part of the product development process will be more successful. Marketers need to focus on building relationships with consumers by fueling their self-expression and helping them establish their own personal brand.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/465783/6.jpg\" alt=\"6\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><br>Coca-Cola used online co-creation to gather expressions of its brand promise “<a href=\"https://en.eyeka.com/contests/6101-coca-cola-energizing-refreshment/results\">Energizing refreshment</a>.” They prompted their audience to unleash their creativity&nbsp;by interpreting Coca-Cola as an energizing refreshment in whatever style or format they wished. Coca-Cola gathered these videos, animations, illustrations, and photographs to use in its marketing campaigns worldwide. This method was mutually beneficially in that Millennials all over the world got to pour a bit of themselves into a product made <em>for</em> them, while helping Coca-Cola bring fresh authenticity to the market.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>7. Push the convenient and practical side.</h3> \n<p>Millennials <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/blakemorgan/2019/01/02/nownership-no-problem-an-updated-look-at-why-millennials-value-experiences-over-owning-things/#2049f5f3522f\">prefer use over ownership</a>, saying they would rather pay full price to access an item when they need it as opposed to owning it. These shoppers would rather rent, share, and barter than buy.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/465783/7.png\" alt=\"7\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><br>In this new “sharing economy,” mobile services and apps such as Spotify and Airbnb, and fashion sites like Rent the Runway and Relapse Clothing, have taken advantage of this crucial opportunity. This is also a new trend in the automotive industry. According to an analysis recently released by car-buying platform Edmunds, Millennials are acquiring cars – they’re just not buying them. Instead, they’re opting to lease more luxurious, tech-forward cars than they could otherwise afford to buy, such as Ram, GMC, and Lexus models. Capitalizing on this “sharing” mentality is a smart move for modern businesses, especially those targeting Millennials. Offer more creative and feasible options so that, in case consumers can’t yet buy, they can at least try.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>8. Lean into the fun and the experiential.</h3> \n<p>Young consumers increasingly see the act of researching and browsing for a purchase more compelling than the purchase itself. Millennials tend to crave the <em>experience</em> of shopping more than the purchase. In other words, online exploration is becoming more than a means to an end, with many young shoppers viewing e-commerce as a form of entertainment. This phenomenon has been coined as “Fauxsumerism.” Pinterest is a perfect example of how the shopping journey can also become an act of personal expression. This social platform, which helps users catalog prospective purchases by curating collections of items of interest, accurately reflects the facts that <a href=\"http://www.mobilecommercedaily.com/millennials-empowered-by-mobile-social-to-dictate-path-to-purchase-report\">40 percent of Millennials make wish lists of products</a>&nbsp;they want to buy (The Intelligence Group).</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/465783/8.png\" alt=\"8\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><br>Successful companies understand that young consumers want to have an enjoyable online browsing experience, which is why brands like Etsy show off their products on Pinterest, making perusing and pinning fun and social. No matter what platform you use, you should market to Millennials in entertaining ways in order to effectively engage them and inspire activity.</p> \n<p>Marketing to Millennials is a long-term play because this group is wired for authentic, content-driven, honest experiences that cater to who they are and their voices they yearn to share. Empower them with the pieces they’re looking for in this puzzling world and remind them that, because of their generation, the bigger picture is looking brighter. Keep this sentiment in mind as you consider millennials as one of your buyer personas.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p> \n<p><em>Editor's note: This post was originally published in August 2015 and has been updated for comprehensiveness.</em></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fmarketing-to-millennials&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 17 Jul 2020 15:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/465783/3.png","linkMd5":"0daf61007934da3307e32eab9b840bf0","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn85@2020_5/2020-07-30/1596118301649_d7b771cc80fa59bb.webp","author":"meaghan@fullfunnel.co (Meaghan Moraes)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/465783/3.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn85@2020_5/2020-07-30/1596118301649_d7b771cc80fa59bb.webp","https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/465783/hqdefault.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn45@2020_6/2020-07-30/1596118307780_c59ec51156b6340d.webp","https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/465783/5.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn49@2020_1/2020-07-30/1596118305068_56d1fd02b01d9778.webp","https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/465783/6.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn77@2020_2/2020-07-30/1596118304795_b0b5ab0594da75cc.webp","https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/465783/7.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn49@2020_4/2020-07-30/1596118312062_9e15590bbe5f5c37.webp","https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/465783/8.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn17@2020_6/2020-07-30/1596118312671_88c5a73878c9176e.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fmarketing-to-millennials&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn93@2020_3/2020-07-30/1596118305160_8319af2d003a8ac1.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-07-30 22:11:40","updatedTime":"2020-07-30 14:11:40","title":"500 Apps of Summer: Customers' Top App Marketplace Picks","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/500-apps-of-summer","description":"<p>Last month, the HubSpot app partner ecosystem passed a notable milestone in <a href=\"https://medium.com/@HubSpot/why-hubspots-building-a-centralized-platform-c9017b2a09f9\">our platform journey</a>: we officially welcomed the 500th app to our <a href=\"https://ecosystem.hubspot.com/marketplace/apps\">App Marketplace</a>.</p>  \n<p>App #500 was <a href=\"https://ecosystem.hubspot.com/marketplace/apps/sales/calling/falemais-voip-216592\">FaleMais VoiP</a>, a popular virtual calling platform headquartered in Brazil that now integrates with the HubSpot CRM. It was great to celebrate the 500-app milestone with their launch in the marketplace, as they represent the growing number of international partners in our ecosystem.</p> \n<p>We're thrilled to have apps from over 30 countries worldwide, from giant market-makers such as <a href=\"https://ecosystem.hubspot.com/marketplace/apps/marketing/ecommerce/shopify\">Shopify</a>, <a href=\"https://ecosystem.hubspot.com/marketplace/apps/sales/sales-enablement/slack\">Slack</a>, and <a href=\"https://ecosystem.hubspot.com/marketplace/apps/marketing/webinar/zoom\">Zoom</a> to entrepreneurial startups that are building apps exclusively for HubSpot, such as <a href=\"https://ecosystem.hubspot.com/marketplace/apps/marketing/ecommerce/depositfix\">DepositFix</a>, <a href=\"https://ecosystem.hubspot.com/marketplace/apps/sales/sales-enablement/geomaptool-178602\">GeoMapper</a>, and <a href=\"https://ecosystem.hubspot.com/marketplace/apps/productivity/project-management/psohub-213771\">PSOhub</a>.

We're not the only ones seeing this growth, Blissfully's 2020 <a href=\"https://www.blissfully.com/saas-trends/2020-annual-report/\">Saas Trends</a> report shares mid-market companies (101-1,000 employees) average over 137 apps to grow their business — a 30% increase year over year.</p> \n<p>For our customers, HubSpot is able to serve as their system of record — \"a single source of truth\" — for customer data and engagement activity across their different tools. Acting as the glue to bring greater cohesion to their stack of SaaS business apps.</p> \n<p>As the ecosystem grows, HubSpot has <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/company-news/hubspot-grows-platform-ecosystem-to-500-apps\">launched improvements</a> to the App Marketplace to help ensure customers continue to gain value.</p> \n<p>Leaning into the pursuit of quality apps and improvements to aid customer choice, we added ratings and reviews and a new certification process to our App Marketplace last quarter.</p> \n<p>Ratings and reviews allow customers to share what they like best about these apps, how well they work with HubSpot, and what they want to see improved. Reviews include sub-ratings for ease of use, features &amp; functionality, value, and support &amp; documentation.</p> \n<p>We are happy to see how thoughtful customers are in sharing their feedback and opinions. App certification helps signify quality and trust for the customer. App certification is the process of having the HubSpot product team complete a technical review and approve an app for quality and efficiency.</p> \n<p>To celebrate the ecosystem's growth — in number of apps and in improvements to usability — we want to highlight some of our top apps.</p> \n<h2><strong>Top 30 Apps by Ratings and Reviews</strong></h2> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/500%20Apps%20of%20Summer-2.png\" alt=\"\">\n</div> \n<p>One of the best indicators of our customers preferred integrations is to look to the top rated and review apps in our App Marketplace.

Did you know that <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/state-of-marketing?hubs_signup-url=www.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing-statistics&amp;hubs_signup-cta=null&amp;_ga=2.258042442.1927936983.1595381564-940436819.1565181751\">over 75% of agency marketers</a> believe that they directly influence revenue? From this stat, it's easy to see that, whether your agency specializes in advertising or branding, you're actively helping clients reach their revenue goals.</p>  \n<p>But maybe your agency hasn't been growing as much as you'd like. If you're finding that you're having trouble gaining qualified leads and sticking out from competitors, you've come to the right place.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Growing your agency happens from the inside. In this post, we're going to talk about seven things you can do in-house that will help your agency grow. When things are uncertain, refer to these tips to grow your client base and develop lasting strategies that will support your business.</p> \n<p>Branding is an image that gives definition to your company in public. Sometimes, the first contact prospects have with agencies are their brand, so yours should speak to your agency.</p> \n<p>For those just starting out with branding, think about your company's mission and goals. From there, create a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/branding?_ga=2.86576088.1927936983.1595381564-940436819.1565181751\">branding strategy</a> that keeps those values, and your customer's needs, at the helm.</p> \n<p>Think about colors, symbols, and formats that represent the values of your organization. For more resources, check out some of <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/branding?_ga=2.258148938.1927936983.1595381564-940436819.1565181751\">these branding strategies and tips.</a></p> \n<p>If you have a brand strategy set in place, focus on improving its structure. Invest in upping the branded content on your social media and website. Your specific, unique style will draw the eyes of customers, and the messaging will keep them engaged.</p> \n<h3>2. Adjust your pricing model if needed.</h3> \n<p>Do your prices accurately reflect the quality of your service offerings? If not, it might be time to adjust them. Make sure the price matches the effort, especially if you've experienced an increase in clientele.</p> \n<p>A set <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/pricing-strategy?_ga=2.258148938.1927936983.1595381564-940436819.1565181751\">pricing model</a> ensures you have enough resources to allocate within your company. You can charge hourly, by commission, or at a fixed rate. But in any case, if you change the pricing model, make it scalable.</p> \n<p>Scaling alleviates the need to constantly change pricing in the future. Frequently adjusting pricing models may result in a loss of certainty with clients. So, reflect what you offer with pricing, stick to it, and alert customers of the adjustment.</p> \n<h3>3. Find and optimize keywords on your website.</h3> \n<p>Think about some of the keywords most commonly associated with your company. Your industry, target audience, and offerings are most likely keywords essential to your business. A social media marketing agency, for example, might use keywords \"marketing industry,\" \"social media agency,\" \"social post scheduling,\" and \"social network analytics.\"</p> \n<p>When you figure out useful keywords, use them on webpages and in supporting content following <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/blog-search-engine-optimization?_ga=2.258148938.1927936983.1595381564-940436819.1565181751\">SEO rules</a>.</p> \n<p>Optimizing your content with keywords gives those web pages a greater chance of ranking highly on Google. Google reads SEO language used on web pages to suggest the best ones for search queries.</p> \n<p>For instance, assigning <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/negative-keywords?_ga=2.258148938.1927936983.1595381564-940436819.1565181751\">negative keywords</a> makes your content show up on more relevant SERPs. In addition to negative keywords, producing branded content with those keywords gets your brand more reach, especially on Google.</p> \n<p>A <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-do-keyword-research-ht?_ga=2.258148938.1927936983.1595381564-940436819.1565181751\">keyword research strategy</a> exposes the content you produce to a wide range of valuable prospects. The right keywords will help draw in the right people.</p> \n<h3>4. Use tools to create a scalable strategy.</h3> \n<p>The process you have for attracting new clients should be able to grow with your company. Your current strategy may not be scalable. Let's talk about how to create one that's more flexible.</p> \n<p>First, identify where in your strategy variables like time management and workload become a problem. When you know what to focus on, you can come up with a solution that serves your company's goals.</p> \n<p>Your new strategy should have room to expand as your company does. Take <a href=\"https://www.archimedia.co.nz/\">ArchiMedia</a>, for instance. The New Zealand-based company went from offering a few marketing services to being a full-service inbound agency. Using <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/growth-platform?hubs_signup-url=www.hubspot.com%2Fcase-studies-directory&amp;hubs_signup-cta=casestudy-readmore&amp;utm_campaign=Growth%20Stack%20Launch&amp;utm_source=Blog&amp;_ga=1.204202064.1181321780.1479841976\">HubSpot's growth platform</a>, the team expanded their strategy into a scalable one that supported the new services.</p> \n<p>The growth platform is a mix of HubSpot's CRM, marketing, and sales tools, specifically designed to maximize growth. ArchiMedia's team created CTAs, landing pages, forms, and analytics to refine lead capture. In five months, their newly expanded strategy <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/case-studies/archimedia?hubs_signup-url=www.hubspot.com%2Fcase-studies-directory&amp;hubs_signup-cta=casestudy-readmore&amp;_ga=2.258148938.1927936983.1595381564-940436819.1565181751\">doubled leads and increased turnover rate</a> by 30%.</p> \n<p>The new strategy fits the expanded services, and makes the process organized and streamlined. If you're not yet using tools to help you improve your strategy, it might be outdated. See what you can do with automation software — it may be what you need to flexibly grow your process.</p> \n<h3>5. Determine an upselling process.</h3> \n<p>Upselling offers more services to a customer on top of what they've agreed to purchase. It involves explaining to the consumer why they can't be without another product. Think about being asked about dessert after finishing dinner at a restaurant — that tactic is upselling.</p> \n<p>Agencies with an upselling process can use it to strengthen client relationships by providing for them at another stage of the buyer's journey. Instead of <em>just</em> offering the social media package to clients, offer analytics reporting for an added fee so they won't have to worry about it later.</p> \n<p>Think about what you can add to solve the challenges of your target audience beyond your core product. That way, your company earns more business. For more resources about how to upsell, check out these posts:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service/upselling?_ga=2.252797513.1927936983.1595381564-940436819.1565181751\">9 Non-Sleazy Strategies for Upselling Your Customers</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service/cross-selling?_ga=2.252797513.1927936983.1595381564-940436819.1565181751\">Cross-Selling and Upselling: The Ultimate Guide</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service/how-to-upsell?_ga=2.252797513.1927936983.1595381564-940436819.1565181751\">How to Upsell Your Customers</a></li> \n</ul> \n<h3>6. Leverage client referrals to earn new customers.</h3> \n<p>Agencies often rely on referrals to boost lead generation. Referrals earn qualified leads from already existing clientele. Being proactive about collecting them gives you a larger sphere of influence, even if clients are already referring.</p> \n<p>Referrals help you gain clients with similar challenges to the ones of your buyer personas. They can work towards increasing your market share and drive revenue.</p> \n<p>Ask clients for a referral after they've shown satisfaction with your work. For supporting content, send an <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service/what-is-nps?_ga=2.252797513.1927936983.1595381564-940436819.1565181751\">NPS survey</a>, create an offer to share, or build an email template. When you ask clients, you'll have measurable content to give.</p> \n<p>When you ask customers, think about giving an incentive so your client will be more inclined to take part. Alternatively, you can start a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service/customer-referral-program?hubs_signup-url=blog.hubspot.com%2Fservice%2Fhow-to-get-referrals&amp;hubs_signup-cta=null\">referral program</a>, so you'll always have a set process for referrals. For more ideas about how to use client referrals, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service/how-to-get-referrals\">check out this list of 14</a>.</p> \n<h3>7. Have a specialization as a selling point.</h3> \n<p>Whether your agency offers one specific skill set or a multitude of services, focus on a specialization. In other words, choose one offering that your customers love, and use it as a selling point.</p> \n<p>Having a specialization helps you earn leads looking for companies with that expertise. When they find your business, they'll be exposed to the full range of how you can help, giving you an upselling opportunity.</p> \n<p>Specialization also helps with branding, as customers identify one service the company is known for — defining your business to prospects. If your social media agency runs near-foolproof campaigns for clients, market that component, and use client referrals to gain more business in that sector.</p> \n<p>You can also use specializations to point out which offering needs more clients by using referrals to revamp and remarket to target customers.</p> \n<p>Whether you're part of a young agency that's just starting out, or in the process of revamping, there's always room for improvement. Maybe you've had a couple of these ideas on the back burner. It might be the perfect time to really dive into how they can help your business in the long run.</p> \n<p>What are going to choose from this list to grow your marketing agency? I can't wait to see what you come up with.</p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fhow-to-grow-your-digital-marketing-agency&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 22 Jul 2020 08:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/digital-marketing-agency-1.jpg#keepProtocol","linkMd5":"0c6adb6b1af58c1fc8dbf1404b81a9b1","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn25@2020_2/2020-07-30/1596118303645_83e34779c582d77a.webp","metaImg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/digital-marketing-agency-1.jpg#keepProtocol","author":"Kayla Carmicheal","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fhow-to-grow-your-digital-marketing-agency&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn5@2020_5/2020-07-30/1596118313279_bbf724f7a804ee48.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-07-30 22:11:40","updatedTime":"2020-07-30 14:11:40","title":"13 Online Team Building Games to Try with Colleagues","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/online-team-building-games","description":"<p>\"As the saying goes, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. This is especially true in the context of distributed teams,\" says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/mcw22/?src=aff-lilpar&amp;veh=aff_src.aff-lilpar_c.partners_pkw.123201_plc.adgoal%20GmbH_pcrid.449670_learning&amp;trk=aff_src.aff-lilpar_c.partners_pkw.123201_plc.adgoal%20GmbH_pcrid.449670_learning&amp;clickid=yCBWJMzKrxyOTv1wUx0Mo38WUkiWFqVxRyHJTQ0&amp;irgwc=1\">Meaghan Williams</a>, HubSpot's Remote Work and Inclusion Program Manager.</p> \n<p>Team building gives your team a greater sense of togetherness.</p>  \n<p>Most likely, you can envision team building games in your head: exciting team outings, fun outdoor activities, or after-work happy hour chats.</p> \n<p>But what does team building <em>online</em> look like?</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>When members of your team work remotely, it can be a slight hurdle to foster team building without face-to-face contact. Williams notes, \"It can be hard to build that same sense of belonging and commitment to the team when you’re remote. That’s where <em>remote team building</em> comes into play.\"</p> \n<p>Although it can be tough to figure out how to build team morale virtually, the task isn't impossible.</p> \n<p>Remote team building games improve the morale of your team and their sense of belonging, which is essential for your team's overall productivity and employee satisfaction</p> \n<p>We've put together a list of exciting team building exercises and games for your remote team to try out. Let's go over them in the next section.</p> \n<h2>Online Team Building Games</h2> \n<p>When coming up with ways to bond with your team online, Williams suggests assuming that anything is an option. This mindset combats restrictive thinking with games and opens up new realms of possibilities.</p> \n<p>\"This mentality has led to everything from remote yoga to remote holiday parties, and we’ve had so much fun along the way,\" she says.</p> \n<p>So with that in mind, let's go over exciting options for building up your team.</p> \n<h3>1. Remote MTV \"Cribs\"</h3> \n<p>Similar to the workings of the hit MTV show <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTV_Cribs\">\"Cribs,\"</a> you and your team could spend some time showing off your remote work spaces. This game, inspired by the team at <a href=\"https://www.helpscout.com/blog/virtual-team-building/\">Help Scout</a>, is a fun way to get a look into the workspaces of your teammates.</p> \n<p>To give it a \"challenging\" aspect, have team members vote on their favorite workspace at the end, and the winner can enjoy the bragging rights of having the most impressive remote work setup.</p> \n<h3>2. Remote Work Bingo</h3> \n<p>Using a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/free-customizable-business-babble-bingo-cards?_ga=2.80748695.1820706288.1588960737-940436819.1565181751\">bingo template</a>, create a bingo card and schedule a quick game as a \"brain break\" for you and your team. You can make it personalized to fit your company and team like the one below:</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/17%20Online%20Team%20Building%20Games%20to%20Try%20with%20Colleagues.png?width=1500&amp;name=17%20Online%20Team%20Building%20Games%20to%20Try%20with%20Colleagues.png\" alt=\"Remote Bingo template from HubSpot\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 1500px;\" width=\"1500\">\n</div> \n<p>Have your teammates submit ideas for Bingo spaces to make it a collaborative process. You can even offer a prize for the winner, such as an online gift card. Another plus — Bingo is easy enough to build into a routine meeting.</p> \n<p>To make Bingo work remotely, pick one person to be the moderator. They would call out a random phrase and wait a few seconds for players to search their card for that phrase. If the player has that phrase on their card, they'd use a tool, such as paint, to mark that space.</p> \n<p>Once a player has marked enough spaces in a row, they'd announce <em>\"Bingo!\" </em>in the video call and wait for the moderator to check their answers. If the row is vertical, horizontal, or diagonal, and matches the spaces, that colleague wins.</p> \n<h3>3. Mafia</h3> \n<p>Mafia is known by a couple of different names, and is often played by large groups. Essentially, the game is a \"whodunnit\" mystery-solving challenge. One of the players is a silent \"killer,\" and it's up to everyone else to figure out the culprit.</p> \n<p>There's a couple of roles to assign in Mafia to keep organizational structure, like \"Doctor,\" \"Townspeople,\" and \"Detective.\" The best part about the game? It can all be played over a video call. Click <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(party_game)\">here</a> for a full run-down of how to play Mafia.</p> \n<p>At HubSpot, we re-created Mafia to fit in a Zoom call. We used a combination of the chat box, Slack, and turning off cameras to re-imagine the campfire classic in a virtual setting.</p> \n<h3>4. Happy Hour</h3> \n<p>One of the most fun remote team building events I've done with my team has been remote happy hour. It's an opportunity for your colleagues to get together and bond outside of work, remotely.</p> \n<p>At HubSpot, we use happy hours to foster a deeper relationship with team members. At one point, we even held a virtual wine tasting, where participants brought a glass of German wine and listened to a colleague explain how to taste for specific qualities, and pointed out things about wine that aren't common knowledge, like how to create air in a wine glass.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Participants can bring any beverage they choose (tea, seltzer, or other non-alcoholic beverages should be encouraged as well), talk about what they've brought, and enjoy a relaxed atmosphere.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>5. Emoji Stories</h3> \n<p>Using less than six emojis, begin to write a story in an instant message thread or the chat section of a video call. Then, one by one, your coworkers will add to that story using five more. You can keep going until every teammate has had a turn, or until you run out of ideas.</p> \n<p>To get the ball rolling, here's a potential story starter: 🏘⛈💡🚫 … what happens next to the neighborhood with no power during a storm?</p> \n<h3>6. DIY Pantry Challenges</h3> \n<p>Are the members of your team obsessed with shows like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MasterChef_(American_TV_series)\">MasterChef</a> or <a href=\"https://www.foodnetwork.com/shows/chopped\">Chopped</a>? Alternatively, are they big into YouTube cooking shows, like Bon Appetit's <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/video/series/gourmet-makes\">Gourmet Makes</a>? If so, it could be fun to challenge your colleagues to create their own version of a popular cooking show or a tutorial of their favorite comfort food recipes!</p> \n<div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"width: 100%; height: auto; position: relative; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; max-width: 1500px; max-height: 1500px; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\"> \n <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 100.00%; margin: 0;\">\n  <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xi28pEbMdTw\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1500\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n </div> \n</div> \n<p>This can be done in a variety of ways, but to give it a \"challenging\" aspect, pick one dish that's simple to make, like a patty melt or mac and cheese. Give your team one week to film their own versions of the recipe, upload it to a Google Drive, and choose the winner based on creativity of the dish.</p> \n<p>Cooking is an awesome way to express creativity, and as the saying goes, food often brings people together. Plus, leftovers mean there's no extra thinking to do when it's lunchtime!</p> \n<h3>7. Book Club</h3> \n<p>HubSpotters are no strangers to book clubs. A recent book club we've hosted centered around a theme of diversity, inclusion, and belonging. One of our colleagues chose a <a href=\"http://mindaharts.com/book/\">book to fit this theme, </a>and participants had a discussion to talk about what the book meant to us and how we could transfer the ideas presented in the book to create change in the workplace.<a href=\"http://mindaharts.com/book/\"></a></p> \n<p>This can be a recurring event or a one-time session, but the purpose is to discuss ideas outside of team projects. It can be a nice break from your day to discuss a good book — whether it's every month or a couple of times a year.</p> \n<h3>8. Pop Culture Trivia</h3> \n<p>What song did Britney Spears perform at the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBlBaCigDAs\">2001 VMAs</a>? What fictional town does sitcom <a href=\"https://www.nbc.com/parks-and-recreation\">Parks and Recreation</a> take place in? Unwind with your coworkers in a friendly game of pop culture trivia — 2000's style.</p> \n<p>You can come up with questions with your team, or look up fun prompts <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/quiz/2019/may/16/do-you-remember-2000s/\">online</a>. Assign a moderator, split your team up into groups, and let the games begin!</p> \n<h3>9. Farm Field Trip</h3> \n<p>Do you remember taking field trips with your classmates when you were younger? They were fun outings to learn and explore with peers. Nowadays, field trip experiences are moving to an online platform so those young and old are able to enjoy these gatherings virtually.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>As an example, you might chat with a local farm to see if they'd be willing to set up a <a href=\"https://www.americandairy.com/news-and-events/dairy-diary/dairy-farming/virtual-farm-tours-while-youre-stuck-at-home.stml\">remote farm tour</a> for your team. We've done this at HubSpot, and it's a great way to bond with colleagues as you virtually fuss over the adorable pigs or goats you see on-screen.</p> \n<h3>10. Scavenger Hunt</h3> \n<p>When was the last time you went on a deep dive of your company website? If your answer is, <em>\"Never,\"</em> here's your chance to challenge your colleagues. Choose pages or tabs from your company's website for yourself and team members, and come up with a group scavenger hunt.</p> \n<p>Break off into teams, or make it a solo venture. After 20 minutes, whoever gets the most points, wins! An idea to get the scavenger hunt ball rolling: <em>\"Find the testimonial from X customer.\"</em></p> \n<h3>11. Lunch and Learn</h3> \n<p>Send an RSVP to your team to join a webinar and learn a new skill. Alternatively, have your colleagues take turns to host mini lunch and learn sessions for tips about how to perform job functions in a simpler way. For instance, if I were to host a session, it might be \"How to Create Awesome Meta Descriptions in Less Than 15 Minutes.\"</p> \n<p>If your team members have very specific roles that differ, this could be a cool opportunity to learn a little more about what your colleagues do. For instance, your social media manager might host one session about his role regarding social accounts, while your web designer hosts another about her experience designing for UX.</p> \n<p>These sessions would give the other insight into how to perform a job function and build a new appreciation for the day-to-day of colleagues.</p> \n<h3>12. Never Have I Ever</h3> \n<p>\"Never Have I Ever: Remote Work Edition\" is another quick stress reliever that helps you learn more about your colleagues. Here are the rules: a team member says something they've never done before, but if those playing have done it, they lower one of their fingers. The person with the most fingers left wins the game.</p> \n<p>If I were to host a version of the game, my first entry might be, <em>\"Never have I ever bought noise-cancelling headphones.\"</em></p> \n<h3>13. Virtual Dance Party</h3> \n<p>If you're like me, you're known for your pretty amazing work playlists. What better way to wind down after a long workday than with a no-judgement dance party with your colleagues? You can even pull up a song from the <a href=\"https://justdancenow.com/\">Just Dance</a> video game series and learn together (you just need a smartphone!):</p> \n<div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"width: 100%; height: auto; position: relative; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; max-width: 1500px; max-height: 1500px; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\"> \n <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 100.00%; margin: 0;\">\n  <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xQ79cheWg5g\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1500\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n </div> \n</div> \n<p>There's no pressure to explode into a fully-choreographed sequence a la <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamma_Mia!_(film)\">Mamma Mia!</a> — all dance styles are encouraged. Blow off steam and enjoy a friendly competition with your team.</p> \n<p>\"Not every idea is going to be a winner, but what’s important is that you’re willing to be vulnerable with each other and give new ideas a try,\" Williams says.</p> \n<p>Additionally, she adds, \"If you’re just embarking on this journey for the first time, be honest with your team about this and ask them to provide feedback on what’s working and what isn’t. Even better, ask them to contribute their own ideas and lead the way on initiatives that they’re excited about.\"</p> \n<p>Team building is all about strengthening the bond of your team through different and fun activities. You can host a Pictionary session through a video call or encourage different areas of discussion during meetings. For more ideas on team building games, Williams suggests giving these options a whirl:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.patchworkadventures.com/\">Patchwork Adventures</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://jackboxgames.com/\">Jack Box Games</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.pinturillo2.com/\">Pinturillo</a></li> \n</ul> \n<p>Most importantly, remember to just have fun with your team and enjoy the time you have together!</p> \n<p><em>Editor's note: This post was originally published in May,2020 and has been updated for comprehensiveness.</em></p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fonline-team-building-games&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 29 Jul 2020 08:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/online-team-games.jpg#keepProtocol","linkMd5":"57ff994e6fdb0bf4e9a3f9664cce1c2a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn97@2020_6/2020-07-30/1596118303768_d8bb3783b360c3a7.webp","metaImg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/online-team-games.jpg#keepProtocol","author":"Kayla Carmicheal","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/17%20Online%20Team%20Building%20Games%20to%20Try%20with%20Colleagues.png?width=1500&name=17%20Online%20Team%20Building%20Games%20to%20Try%20with%20Colleagues.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn93@2020_6/2020-07-30/1596118308964_aaf9d9f7d6816201.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fonline-team-building-games&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn65@2020_5/2020-07-30/1596118306089_c5e70bfe6d1d9fee.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-07-30 22:11:40","updatedTime":"2020-07-30 14:11:40","title":"Your Blueprint to Create the Perfect Content Marketing Strategy","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-marketing-blueprint-ht","description":"<p>Creating content can feel discouraging.</p>  \n<p>For instance, you might spend hours producing something that's amazing, only to get little engagement, traffic, or leads.

For more information on content marketing strategies, we've <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/content-marketing-training-workbook?_ga=2.169641957.590945011.1590369168-940436819.1565181751\">created a content marketing workbook</a> that's free to download.</p> \n<p>Otherwise, let's dive into creating a content marketing strategy that will bring you that ROI you're looking to earn.</p> \n<h2>How to Develop and Implement a Successful Content Marketing Strategy</h2> \n<p>We're going to look at three different stages that make up the blueprint. These stages will outline the main steps you can take to create your strategy. Then, we'll go into depth with details about making that happen.</p> \n<p>Let's start with step one — getting decision-makers on-board with your strategy.</p> \n<h3>Stage 1: Getting buy-in from your stakeholders in order to green light your strategy.</h3> \n<p>All great content marketing plans start with getting people within the company to buy into your vision — basically, the people who can give you the resources, budget, or information that's required to make your plans a successful reality.</p> \n<p>For example, internal customer-facing teams, such as customer support, can share their expertise and help fuel your content creation efforts. Because they have regular contact with customers, they'll know some of your audience's biggest challenges or what they care most about — which comes in handy when you need to create content those customers care about.</p> \n<p>Additionally, your marketing team likely has a limited budget. To implement certain strategies and forgo others, it's vital you're able to get leadership on board with your vision.</p> \n<p>To make this happen, you'll need a pretty awesome pitch. Generally, this pitch should do three things:</p> \n<h4>1. Talk about key challenges you will solve with your strategy.</h4> \n<p>You'll want to give an overview of the key challenges your content marketing plan will solve. Instead of complicating this step with an overload of data points, keep it simple and concise. Summarize your key challenges in just a couple of charts so it's more comprehensive.</p> \n<p>For example, in this chart below, the marketer's key challenge is that their overall <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/beginner-inbound-lead-generation-guide-ht?_ga=2.169641957.590945011.1590369168-940436819.1565181751\">CPL</a> (cost per lead) is being inflated by the amount of money they are spending to acquire leads through paid programs.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/example%20of%20CPL.png?width=624&amp;name=example%20of%20CPL.png\" alt=\"example of CPL\" width=\"624\" style=\"width: 624px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">By implementing a solid content strategy, CPL can be reduced. Notice how this chart states the need for a strategy, presents key supporting data, and makes that information easy to comprehend.</p> \n<h4>2. Talk about how your strategy will relate to business metrics.</h4> \n<p>Try to always keep your audience in mind. Senior management will be focused on cost and revenue. How can your marketing strategy help with those metrics?</p> \n<p>In the example above, the answer is clear: Reducing the CPL reduces the cost it takes to acquire a customer, which can increase profit down the road.</p> \n<p>When you present your pitch to decision makers, make sure to outline how reaching your goal will also help reach the greater goals of your business.</p> \n<h4>3. Give high-level details on your strategy to achieve these goals.</h4> \n<p>Finally, you might consider talking through how your content strategy is going to help solve these key challenges and influence those business metrics. You can use this <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-plan-template-generator?utm_campaign=Offer%20-%20Marketing%20Plan%20Generator&amp;utm_source=HS-blog&amp;_ga=2.105532359.590945011.1590369168-940436819.1565181751\">template generator</a> to help you organize your ideas. The goal of this step is to prove to senior-level management that you've thought through your plan and what resources you need to make it a reality.</p> \n<p>Now, you've created your pitch and you're ready to present to upper-level management. Remember, this pitch will help you convince the right people that your content marketing strategy will be successful.</p> \n<p>You should have a pitch before you begin planning your content strategy because you'll stakeholders will be aware of what campaign you plan to run to achieve your business goals. However, while you don't need to fully develop your strategy until you get support from leadership, it's still critical you spend time reviewing metrics and making a tentative game-plan for when you do develop the strategy.</p> \n<p>Next, we're going to talk about how to develop that aforementioned winning strategy.</p> \n<h3>Stage 2: Develop your content strategy.</h3> \n<p>In a <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/driving-content-success-in-2014?_ga=2.105532359.590945011.1590369168-940436819.1565181751\">HubSpot report</a>, it was found that 56% of survey respondents said they were doing content marketing without a plan. Content creation can definitely be difficult, but having a content plan helps. It takes into account key challenges, business goals, and metrics, which will make you more successful in the long term.</p> \n<p>Let's talk about what a winning content strategy should include.</p> \n<h4>1. Include the buyer personas you are targeting.</h4> \n<p>At HubSpot, we <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/when-to-add-remove-persona-from-marketing-strategy-ht?_ga=2.105532359.590945011.1590369168-940436819.1565181751\">align content around different buyer personas</a>. This allows us to stay really focused on for whom we're creating content. We keep our buyer personas' goals and challenges in mind so we can address these at each stage of the buying process.</p> \n<p>As an example, here is a persona I've built for a company software company that provides tools that streamline day-to-day business processes, offers inbound marketing courses, and makes reporting easier.</p> \n<p>Meet \"Marketing Macy\":</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Marketing%20Macy.png?width=784&amp;name=Marketing%20Macy.png\" alt=\"Marketing Macy persona\" width=\"784\" style=\"width: 784px;\"></p> \n<p>To make this persona, I used a <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/make-my-persona?_ga=2.266618570.590945011.1590369168-940436819.1565181751\">free persona builder</a> that made the process incredibly fun. In addition, I was able to point out exactly how to connect with a target audience by identifying why they would love a company and what challenges they were looking to solve.</p> \n<p>To create content that's going to be relevant to Macy at each stage of the buying cycle, we've included key information about her goals, challenges, and why she would love a company that offers CRM and CMS software. Knowing an ideal target customer like Macy makes it easier to connect with them.</p> \n<h4>2. Understand where the content gaps are in your buying cycle.</h4> \n<p>Make sure you understand where the content gaps are in the buying cycle for your buyer personas. To achieve this, you should conduct a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/company-content-audit?_ga=2.266618570.590945011.1590369168-940436819.1565181751\">content audit</a>. Additionally, ask yourself if your buyer persona has the information they need at each point of the buying cycle.</p> \n<p>For example, at HubSpot, content is created that attracts Mary to our site and helps her evaluate our software based upon what we know about her goals and challenges. We then ask ourselves if she has everything necessary to feel confident in purchasing our product based on those goals and challenges.</p> \n<p>If you identify those gaps, you can focus on making sure that content is in your strategy. For instance, let's say that you have a gap in content for the evaluation stage. Identifying that is the first step in creating helpful content for that stage.</p> \n<p>Next, we'll talk about how to create and push the content that will bridge those gaps.</p> \n<h4>3. Create relevant content ideas and stick to an editorial calendar.</h4> \n<p>Once you have identified your personas and understand what content you need to move them through the buyer process, it's time to brainstorm content ideas to fill in those holes.</p> \n<p>When you understand to whom you're marketing, it can be easier to come up with relevant content. To ease the process further, check out our post about how to <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-mapping-template-personalize-marketing?_ga=2.266618570.590945011.1590369168-940436819.1565181751\">map out content</a>. Ultimately, though, make sure every piece of content you create is engaging, delightful, and created with intent.</p> \n<p>Ask yourself during the creation process if your content achieves those three things. Let's look at this social media post as an example:</p> \n<iframe style=\"border: none; overflow: hidden; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\" src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fhubspot%2Fposts%2F10158214020774394&amp;width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"595\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> \n<p>This post is engaging because it includes a graphic that attracts the attention of audiences. It's delightful, because the graphic and supporting copy are easy to comprehend and uses emojis to illustrate a point. Additionally, it's created with the intent to provide value to customers who may be looking for remote working tips.</p> \n<p>Creating content is half the battle, though. Another thing to figure out is when to schedule the publishing of that content so it gets seen by the right people and is delivered consistently.</p> \n<p>That is why all great content plans have an editorial calendar so that people within the company can see what content is being published and what dates that content is going live. <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/business-blog-editorial-calendar-templates?_ga=2.266618570.590945011.1590369168-940436819.1565181751\">Editorial calendars</a> keep teams in sync and organized — as far as visual workflows go, it's a necessity.</p> \n<p>When you've identified your persona, created content for them, and have finalized a calendar-based schedule, this stage is complete. The next stage is to figure out the publishing details.</p> \n<h3>Stage 3: Determine a publishing plan for your content strategy.</h3> \n<p>One of the biggest shifts in marketing today is transforming our mindset from that of a traditional marketer to that of a publisher. Sometimes, as marketers, we think in terms of immediate wins, which is why we tend to prioritize our ad budget for paid media. We invest a certain amount of spend in return for an approximate number of leads and customers.</p> \n<p>Moving to a publisher model means investing more upfront to <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/how-hubspot-does-inbound-creating-a-content-machine?_ga=2.266618570.590945011.1590369168-940436819.1565181751\">start creating content assets that will have a far greater impact</a> over a longer period of time. For example, the HubSpot blog generates most of its traffic from blog posts not published in that month. This is because the content we've created in the past has long-term value for the company in both the leads and customers they generate each month.</p> \n<p>A lot of companies talk themselves out of publishing before they even get started due to a lack of immediate resources. However, a content team of one can be successful if they know how to source content effectively.</p> \n<p>Here are two tips to keep in mind to become a publishing rockstar:</p> \n<h4>1. Think about scaling your content by repackaging in several formats.</h4> \n<p>Consumers today connect with brands across different channels, whether that be on social media, through email marketing, or on your website. When developing a new piece of content, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/examples-repurposing-content?_ga=2.266618570.590945011.1590369168-940436819.1565181751\">think about how you can repurpose that content</a> into various formats.</p> \n<p>For example, if you've developed a series of blog posts, such as a series about customer retention, you could turn them into a comprehensive customer service ebook.</p> \n<h4>2. Make sure the quality of your content always remains high.</h4> \n<p>Whether you're creating a single piece of content a week or several pieces a day, the quality of your content should always remain extremely high if you want it to pay off in the long run.</p> \n<p>Creating an editorial checklist will help you manage this process. With a checklist, you can quickly check each piece of content for quality issues and educate your team on what it takes to publish content for your company.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/content-marketing-blueprint?_ga=2.266618570.590945011.1590369168-940436819.1565181751\">In HubSpot's content blueprint</a>, you'll find a range of templates that make scaling content really easy and provides an intuitive, ready-made editorial checklist.</p> \n<h3>Stage 4: Promote your content early and regularly.</h3> \n<p>So, you know about your target audience and you've created content specifically tailored to them. The task now is <i>how</i> to distribute that content to your audience effectively.</p> \n<p>The key to effective distribution is to increase the number of distribution channels, such as blogs, email, and social properties. Additionally, you have to expand the reach of that content to a broader audience.</p> \n<p>Promotion is a critical part of a content blueprint and something marketers should think about at great length during their planning phase.</p> \n<p>To become an expert at promotion, you should:</p> \n<h4>1. Make promotion an essential part of the planning process.</h4> \n<p>When my team is planning out a content campaign, we put as much thought into the distribution of that content as we do into the campaign development. We want to know who that content is for and how can we make sure they get it.</p> \n<p>For instance, if you are distributing content on social media platforms, discuss in great length how to prioritize budget, posting schedule, and using the tools offered by social channels to expand the reach of your content.</p> \n<h4>2. Make sure your team is equipped with promotional skills.</h4> \n<p>Being able to promote content to the right audience isn't an easy job. Over time, the skills to distribute content effectively will be critical to long-term success.</p> \n<p>If you want to learn more about how you can be effective at promoting your content, we have lots of information on outreach, seeding your content, and even the best way to repackage it for different networks to increase its exposure right inside — you've guessed it —<a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/content-marketing-blueprint?_ga=2.103031364.590945011.1590369168-940436819.1565181751\">our content blueprint</a>.</p> \n<p>Sometimes, learning the proper promotional skills comes with trial and error. You have to figure out what your audience responds to the most. For instance, you can <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-do-a-b-testing?_ga=2.103031364.590945011.1590369168-940436819.1565181751\">create an A/B test</a> with the content you want to push on social channels to see what types of messaging your audience prefers.</p> \n<p>Additionally, you can experiment with multiple content types to get a gauge of what targeted content really resonates with your audience. To get an idea, check out what your competition is doing, and what works for them. You can also do some <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service/social-listening?_ga=2.103031364.590945011.1590369168-940436819.1565181751\">social listening</a> to observe the patterns in web behavior of your target customers.</p> \n<p>How are you doing with your content strategy so far in 2020? Where do you hope to improve your content marketing the most this year?

You've digested countless tips and tricks for improving your website's SEO. You've even (over)paid that self-proclaimed \"expert\" to help you develop an SEO strategy that aligns with your business goals.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>But after all of the reading and learning and strategizing, it dawns on you: You haven't actually<em> done</em> anything yet. Perhaps you're intimidated. Maybe you're crunched for time.</p> \n<p>Regardless, when it comes to on-page SEO, there's no excuse for dragging your feet. On-page SEO has the power to bring countless new visitors — and customers — right to your website.</p> \n<p>On-page SEO is also completely up to you: <em>You </em>get to establish what the topic and/or goal of each page will be. <em>You</em> get to decide on the target audience for that page. And <em>you</em> get to choose the target keywords and phrases you want to focus on.</p> \n<p>All you have to do is get started, and we built this guide to help you.</p> \n<p></p> \n<a></a> \n<p>Google's algorithm ranks your website on three main factors: on-page SEO, off-page SEO, and technical SEO:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>We'll cover <a href=\"#on-page-seo-elements\">on-page SEO elements below</a>.</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/6487/The-ABCs-of-Off-Page-SEO-Tactics.aspx\">Off-page SEO </a>refers to social sharing, external linking, and more.</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/technical-seo\">Technical SEO</a> refers to all the SEO elements not included in on-page and off-page practices, such as structured data, site speed, and mobile readiness — the more <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/the-beginners-guide-to-technical-seo-7-resources-you-should-use\">technical parts of SEO</a>.</li> \n</ul> \n<p><strong>Note</strong>: This SEO \"trilogy\" isn't always divided into three clean sections; some of these SEO elements will overlap. You'll see how and why throughout this piece.</p> \n<h3>Why is on-page SEO important?</h3> \n<p>On-page SEO is important because it tells Google all about your website and how you provide value to visitors and customers. <strong>It helps your site be optimized for both human eyes and search engine bots.</strong></p> \n<p>Merely creating and publishing your website isn't enough — you must optimize it for Google and other search engines in order to rank and attract new traffic.</p> \n<p>On-page SEO is called \"on-page\" because the tweaks and changes you make to optimize your website can be seen by visitors <em>on your page</em> (whereas off-page and technical SEO elements aren't always visible).</p> \n<p>Every part of on-page SEO is completely up to you; that's why it's critical that you do it correctly. Now, let's discuss the elements of on-page SEO.</p> \n<a></a> \n<p>All on-page SEO elements fall into three main categories:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"#content-elements\">Content elements</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"#html-elements\">HTML elements</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"#site-architecture-elements\">Site architecture elements</a></li> \n</ul> You'll see these elements divided into sections below. \n<a></a> \n<h3>Content Elements</h3> \n<p>Content elements refer to the elements within your site copy and content. In this section, we'll focus mostly on crafting high-quality page content that benefits your visitors and tells Google that your website provides value.</p> \n<h4>High-Quality Page Content</h4> \n<p>Page content is the heart of on-page SEO. It tells both search engines and readers what your website and business are all about.</p> \n<p>The first step to creating high-quality content is choosing relevant keywords and topics. Conduct keyword research by searching Google for terms and seeing what surfaces for competitors and other websites. You can also use tools like <a href=\"http://ahrefs.com\">Ahrefs</a>, <a href=\"http://answerthepublic.com\">AnswerthePublic</a>, and <a href=\"https://neilpatel.com/ubersuggest/\">UberSuggest</a>.</p> \n<p>Also, read our <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-do-keyword-research-ht\">Beginner's Guide on How to Do Keyword Research for SEO</a>.</p> \n<p>Next, consider how your page content falls into the buyer's journey and visitors' search intent. These will impact how you will use your keywords and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-for-every-funnel-stage?_ga=2.76145557.1605302133.1560446833-1493293515.1553017609\">what types of content you will create</a>:</p> \n<table style=\"width: 100%;\"> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td style=\"width: 50%;\"><strong>Stage in the Buyer's Journey</strong></td> \n   <td style=\"width: 50%;\"><strong>Suggested Content/Website Pages</strong></td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td style=\"width: 50%;\">Awareness</td> \n   <td style=\"width: 50%;\"> <p>Blog posts, videos<br>homepage</p> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td style=\"width: 50%;\">Consideration</td> \n   <td style=\"width: 50%;\"> <p>Buyer's guides, case studies<br>about page</p> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td style=\"width: 50%;\">Decision</td> \n   <td style=\"width: 50%;\"> <p>Product demos, comparison tools<br>product or pricing pages, contact page</p> </td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table> \n<p>Now, it's time to write your page content or clean it up if you're currently auditing your on-page SEO.</p> \n<p>Here are a few best practices for writing high-quality page content (we'll touch on some of these in more detail below, in our <a href=\"#on-page-seo-checklist\">Checklist</a>):</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Incorporate <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/seo-site-keyword-optimize-ht\">short and long-tail keywords</a> <em>naturally.</em></li> \n <li>Add engaging and relevant visual content.</li> \n <li>Write for your specific <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/buyer-persona-research?_ga=2.112348804.1605302133.1560446833-1493293515.1553017609\">buyer persona(s).</a></li> \n <li>Actively solve your audience's problem.</li> \n <li>Develop content people will share and want to link to.</li> \n <li>Optimize for conversions with CTAs to offers and product pages.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Page content is your opportunity to communicate value to Google and your site visitors; it's the heart of the on-page SEO process. All other on-page SEO elements stem from high-quality page content, so invest ample resources to develop and optimize it.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>HTML Elements</h3> \n<p>HTML elements refer to the elements in your source code.</p> \n<p>Note: To see the source code for any page in your browser, click View &gt; Developer &gt; View Source in the top menu.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h4>Page Titles</h4> \n<p>Your website page titles (also known as <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/website-title\">title tags</a>) are one of the most important SEO elements.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202019-06-12%20at%202.06.48%20PM.png?width=1500&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202019-06-12%20at%202.06.48%20PM.png\" alt=\"on page seo page title tag\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>Titles tell both visitors and search engines what they can find on the corresponding pages.</p> \n<p>To ensure your site pages rank for the proper intent, be sure to include the focus keyword for each page in the title. Incorporate your keyword as naturally as possible.</p> \n<p>Here are some best practices for when developing a page title:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Keep it under 70 characters (per <a href=\"https://seopressor.com/blog/google-title-meta-descriptions-length/\">Google's update</a>) ... any longer and your title will be cut off in search results. Mobile search results show up to 78 characters.</li> \n <li>Don't stuff the title with keywords. Not only does keyword-stuffing present a spammy and tacky reading experience, but modern search engines are smarter than ever — they've been designed to specifically monitor for (and penalize!) content that's unnaturally stuffed with keywords.</li> \n <li>Make it relevant to the page.</li> \n <li>Don't use all caps.</li> \n <li>Include your brand in the title, i.e. \"<em>The Ultimate Guide to On-Page SEO in 2019 — HubSpot Blog</em>\".</li> \n</ul> \n<p><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/datadriven-strategies-titles-headlines?hubs_post-cta=pillar_allphrase\"><em>Check out our free data-driven guide to writing effective page titles.</em></a></p> \n<h4>Headers</h4> \n<p>Headers, also known as body tags, refer to the HTML element &lt;h1&gt;, &lt;h2&gt;, &lt;h3&gt;, and so on.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202019-06-12%20at%202-07-12%20PM.png?width=1500&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202019-06-12%20at%202-07-12%20PM.png\" alt=\"on page seo headers\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>These tags help organize your content for readers and help search engines distinguish what part of your content is most important and relevant, depending on search intent.</p> Incorporate important keywords in your \n<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/a-simple-formula-for-writing-kick-ass-titles-ht\">headers</a>, but choose different ones than what's in your page title. Put your most important keywords in your &lt;h1&gt; and &lt;h2&gt; headers.\n<br>\n<a></a> \n<h4>Meta Descriptions</h4> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/meta-descriptions\">Meta descriptions</a> are the short page descriptions that appear under the title in search results. Although it's not an official ranking factor for search engines, it can influence whether or not your page is clicked on — therefore, it's just as important when doing on-page SEO.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202019-06-12%20at%201.43.05%20PM.png?width=1500&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202019-06-12%20at%201.43.05%20PM.png\" alt=\"on page seo meta descriptions\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>Meta descriptions can also be copied over to social media when your content is shared (by using <a href=\"#structured-markup\" style=\"font-size: 1em;\">structured markup, which we talk about below</a>), so it can encourage click-throughs from there, too.</p> \n<p>Here's what makes for a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-write-meta-description-ht\">good meta description</a>:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Keep it under 160 characters, although <a href=\"https://seopressor.com/blog/google-title-meta-descriptions-length/\">Google has been known to allow longer meta descriptions</a> — up to 220 characters. (<span style=\"font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;\">Note</span>: Mobile devices cut off meta descriptions at 120 characters.)</li> \n <li>Include your entire keyword or keyword phrase.</li> \n <li>Use a complete, compelling sentence (or two).</li> \n <li>Avoid alphanumeric characters like —, &amp;, or +.</li> \n</ul> \n<a></a> \n<h4>Image Alt-text</h4> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/image-alt-text\">Image alt-text</a> is like SEO for your images. It tells Google and other search engines what your images are about ... which is important because Google now delivers almost as many image-based results as they do text-based results.</p> \n<p>That means consumers may be discovering your site through your images. In order for them to do this, though, you have to add alt-text to your images.</p> \n<p>Here's what to keep in mind when adding image alt-text:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Make it descriptive and specific.</li> \n <li>Make it contextually relevant to the broader page content.</li> \n <li>Keep it shorter than 125 characters.</li> \n <li>Use keywords sparingly, and don't keyword stuff.</li> \n</ul> \n<a></a> \n<h4>Structured Markup</h4> \n<p>Structured markup, or <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/structured-data\">structured data</a>, is the process of \"marking up\" your website source code to make it easier for Google to find and understand different elements of your content.</p> \n<p>Structured markup is the key behind those featured snippets, knowledge panels, and other content features you see when you search for something on Google. It's also <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/structured-data#social-cards\">how your specific page information shows up so neatly</a> when someone shares your content on social media.</p> \n<p><strong>Note</strong>: Structured data is considered technical SEO, but I'm including it here because optimizing it creates a better on-page experience for visitors.</p> \n<h3><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202019-06-12%20at%202.04.25%20PM.png?width=1500&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202019-06-12%20at%202.04.25%20PM.png\" alt=\"on page seo structured markup\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></h3> \n<a></a> \n<h3>Site Architecture Elements</h3> \n<p>Site architecture elements refer to the elements that make up your website and site pages. How you structure your website can help Google and other search engines easily crawl the pages and page content.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h4>Page URLs</h4> \n<p>Your <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-optimize-urls-for-search\">page URLs</a> should be simple to digest for both readers and search engines. They are also important when keeping your site hierarchy consistent as you create subpages, blog posts, and other types of internal pages.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202019-06-12%20at%202.16.04%20PM.png?width=1500&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202019-06-12%20at%202.16.04%20PM.png\" alt=\"on page seo page url\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>For example, in the above URL, \"blog\" is the sub-domain, \"hubspot.com\" is the domain, \"sales\" is the directory for the <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/sales\">HubSpot Sales Blog</a>, and \"startups\" indicates the specific path to that blog post.</p> \n<p>Here are a few tips on how to write <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/url-structure-search-friendly\">SEO-friendly URLs</a>:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Remove the extra, unnecessary words.</li> \n <li>Use only one or two keywords.</li> \n <li>Use <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-is-ssl\">HTTPS</a> if possible, as Google now uses that as a positive ranking factor.</li> \n</ul> \n<a></a> \n<h4>Internal Linking</h4> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/31388/How-to-Use-Internal-Linking-to-Improve-Your-Website-s-SEO.aspx\">Internal linking</a> is the process of hyperlinking to other helpful pages on your website. (See how the words \"internal linking\" are linked to another HubSpot blog post in the sentence above? That's an example.)</p> \n<p>Internal linking is important for on-page SEO because internal links send readers to other pages on your website, keeping them around longer and thus telling Google your site is valuable and helpful.</p> \n<p>Also, the longer visitors are on your website, the more time Google has to crawl and index your site pages. This ultimately helps Google absorb more information about your website and potentially rank it higher on the search engine results pages.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/deep-dive-into-internal-linking-for-seo?hubs_post-cta=pillar_allphrase\"><em>Download our free guide to Internal Linking for SEO.</em></a></p> \n<h4>Mobile Responsiveness</h4> \n<p><a href=\"https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2018/03/rolling-out-mobile-first-indexing.html\">Google started favoring sites that are optimized for faster mobile speeds</a> — even for desktop searches.</p> \n<p>Mobile responsiveness matters.</p> \n<p>It's critical to choose a website hosting service, site design and theme, and content layout that's <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/responsive-design-list?_ga=2.109659013.1605302133.1560446833-1493293515.1553017609\">readable and navigable on mobile devices</a>.

When it comes to on-page SEO, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/google-page-speed\">page speed</a> counts big-time.</p> \n<p>Google cares about user experience first and foremost. If your site loads slowly or haphazardly, it's likely your visitors aren't going to stick around — and Google knows that. Moreover, site speed can <a href=\"https://designers.hubspot.com/blog/site-speed-test-improve-conversion-roi\">impact conversions and ROI</a>.</p> \n<p>Check your website's speed anytime using <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/\">Google's PageSpeed Insights tool</a>.

The HubSpot marketing team released an updated version of our <strong><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/seo-template-guide?hubs_post-cta=pillar_allphrase\">On-Page SEO Template</a>, </strong>an Excel document that allows you to coordinate pages and keywords — and track changes — all in one place.</p> \n<p>In this section, we'll be using this template as a guide as we walk you through a checklist for your on-page SEO management, step by step. <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/seo-template-guide?hubs_post-cta=pillar_allphrase\">Download the template now</a> and follow along.</p> \n<p><strong>Note:</strong> The fictional website \"http://www.quantify.ly\" will be used as an example throughout this post. It's simply meant to help you imagine how your own website will fit into the template.<em><br></em></p> \n<h3>1. Crawl your website.</h3> \n<p>Get an overview of all of your website pages that search engines have indexed. For HubSpot customers, our <a href=\"https://knowledge.hubspot.com/cos-general/analyze-your-page-or-blog-post-performance-and-seo-optimization\">Page Performance</a> tool (under Reports) will allow you to do this. If you're not using HubSpot, you can try using a <a title=\"free tool like Xenu's link crawler\" href=\"http://xenus-link-sleuth.en.softonic.com\">free tool like Xenu's link crawler</a>.</p> \n<p>After crawling your site and exporting the results into an Excel (or .csv) file, there will be three key columns of data that you should focus on:</p> \n<ol> \n <li>The web address (a.k.a. URL)</li> \n <li>The page title</li> \n <li>The page meta description</li> \n</ol> Copy and paste these three columns into your template.\n<br> \n<p>The URL should be pasted into column B, the page title into column C, and the description into column E.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/on-page-seo-checklist-1-2.png?width=1500&amp;name=on-page-seo-checklist-1-2.png\" alt=\"on-page seo checklist crawl your website\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<h3>2. Conduct an SEO audit and define your site architecture.</h3> \n<p>Now that you have a basic index of your site in the template, you'll want to organize and prioritize your web pages. Start by defining where within your site architecture your existing pages currently sit.</p> \n<p>Do this in column A. Note whether a page is your homepage (ideally you'll only have one of those), a page in your primary (or secondary) navigation menu, an internal page, and so on.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/on-page-seo-checklist-2-2.png?width=1500&amp;name=on-page-seo-checklist-2-2.png\" alt=\"on-page seo checklist conduct an seo audit\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<h3>3. Update URLs, page titles, and meta descriptions.</h3> \n<p>Review your current URLs, page titles, and meta descriptions to see if they need updating.</p> \n<p>(This is the beauty of using a template to organize your SEO: You get a broad overview of the type of content you have on your website.)</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/on-page-seo-checklist-3-2.png?width=1500&amp;name=on-page-seo-checklist-3-2.png\" alt=\"on page seo checklist meta descriptions\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>Notice how column D and column F automatically calculate the length of each element. The recommended length for page titles is anything under 60 characters. (And, actually, a quick and easy optimization project is to update all page titles that are longer than 60 characters.)</p> \n<p>The recommended length for page meta descriptions is 155-160 characters. This is the perfect length to ensure none of the description is cut off by the ellipses. Make sure you're not too repetitive with keywords in this space. Writing a good meta description isn't tough, but it deserves just as much consideration as the page content itself.</p> \n<p>(<strong>Note:</strong> For some sites, you may also have to update the URLs, but that's not always the case and thus was not included as part of this optimization template.)</p> \n<h3>4. Make sure your keyword is in your URL.<em><br></em></h3> \n<p>As <a href=\"#on-page-seo-URL-keyowrd\">we mentioned above</a>, add your keyword to your URL. For example, image you own a hot yoga studio called ADYoga. You have a web page that includes videos of your classes. The keyword for this page is \"hot yoga online classes\" — so, you'd want to include that keyword in your URL. The URL for this web page may look like this: www.ADyoga.com/hot-yoga-online-classes.</p> \n<h3>5. Include your keyword throughout your web page.</h3> \n<p>In addition to your URL, you'll want to add your keyword throughout your web page(s). This includes your title and headers. Sprinkle your keyword throughout your content as well where it fits naturally.</p> \n<h3>6. Track keywords and topics for each page.</h3> \n<p>Think of your target keyword as the designated topic for a particular page. If you're using the HubSpot template, In column O, define just one topic per page.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/on-page-seo-checklist-8.png?width=1500&amp;name=on-page-seo-checklist-8.png\" alt=\"on-page seo checklist track keywords and topics for your web pages\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>By doing this, you'll be able to go more in-depth and provide more detailed information about that topic. This also means that you are only optimizing for one keyword per page, meaning you have a greater chance to rank for that keyword.</p> \n<p>There are, of course, a few exceptions to this rule. Your homepage is a classic example. The goal of your homepage is to explain what your <em>entire</em> website is about, and thus you'll need a few keywords to do that. Another exception is overview pages like services and product pages, which outline what all of your products and services may be.</p> \n<h3>7. Don’t keyword stuff.</h3> \n<p>We just covered many examples in which keywords are both helpful and necessary for SEO purposes. However, one mistake many first-timers make when improving their on-page SEO is \"keyword stuff\".</p> \n<p>Keyword stuffing can be detrimental to your website and web page's SEO and it can feel spammy to readers/ visitors.</p> \n<h3>8. Establish value propositions for each page.</h3> \n<p>A very important next step, which is often overlooked, is establishing a value proposition for each page of your website. Each page should have a goal aside from just ranking for a particular term.</p> \n<p>If you're using the template, you'll do this in column G.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/on-page-seo-checklist-4-1.png?width=1500&amp;name=on-page-seo-checklist-4-1.png\" alt=\"on-page seo checklist establish value propositions\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<h3>9. Define your target audience.</h3> \n<p>Define your target audience — do you have a single buyer persona or multiple personas? Keep this persona in mind as you optimize your site's pages. (Remember, you are optimizing for humans, too — not just search engine robots.)</p> \n<p>In column H of our template, you'll have the opportunity to define your page's target audience.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/on-page-seo-checklist-5-2.png?width=1500&amp;name=on-page-seo-checklist-5-2.png\" alt=\"on-page seo checklist define your target audience\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<h3>10. Plan new page titles.</h3> \n<p>Now that you've documented your existing page titles and have established value propositions and target audiences for each of your pages, write new page titles (if necessary) to reflect your findings.</p> \n<p>You can do this in column K of the template — and double check each title length in column L.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/on-page-seo-checklist-6.png?width=1500&amp;name=on-page-seo-checklist-6.png\" alt=\"on-page seo checklist plan new page titles\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>People usually follow the formula of \"Keyword Phrase | Context.\" The goal of the page title is to lay out the purpose of the page without being redundant. You should also keep the additional recommendations we <a href=\"#how-to-optimize-your-website-title\">made above</a> related to titles.</p> \n<h3>11. Add new meta descriptions.</h3> \n<p><a href=\"#meta-descriptions-for-seo\">As we covered above</a>, meta descriptions should be a short, declarative sentence that incorporates the same keyword as your page's title.</p> \n<p>It should <em>not</em> reflect the content verbatim as it appears on the page. Get as close as you can to the 150-character limit to maximize space and tell visitors as much as possible about your page.</p> \n<p>If you need to create new meta descriptions, do so in column M of the template.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/on-page-seo-checklist-7.png?width=1500&amp;name=on-page-seo-checklist-7.png\" alt=\"on-page seo checklist add meta descriptions\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<h3>12. Review and edit page content as needed.</h3> \n<p>Good copy needs to be thorough, clear, and provide solutions ... so, be compelling! Write for your target audience and about how you can help them. Compelling content is also error-free, so double check your spelling and grammar.</p> \n<p>Aim to have at least 500 words per page, and format content to make it easier to read and digest with the use of headers and subheaders.</p> \n<p>Columns P through R can be used to keep track of changes that you've made to your content or to note where changes need to be implemented.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/on-page-seo-checklist-9.png?width=1500&amp;name=on-page-seo-checklist-9.png\" alt=\"on-page seo checklist review and edit content on your web page\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<h3>13. Incorporate visual content.<strong><br></strong></h3> \n<p>Content can be more than just text, so consider what kind of visual content you can incorporate into each page (if it adds value and serves a purpose, of course). Columns S and T allow you to note which visual elements need to be added. When adding an image to a page, be sure to include a descriptive file name and image alt-text.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/on-page-seo-checklist-10.png?width=1500&amp;name=on-page-seo-checklist-10.png\" alt=\"on-page seo checklist incorporate visual content\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<h3>14. Optimize your visual content.</h3> \n<p><a href=\"#image-alt-text\">We talked earlier</a> about <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/image-alt-text\">image alt text</a>. You'll want to optimize your visual content this way — and be sure to include your keyword in your image alt text. It'll help with the page's SEO as well as offer the potential to rank in image search (e.g. on a search engine image results page or image carousel).</p> \n<h3>15. Add internal links.<strong><br></strong></h3> \n<p><a href=\"#internally-link-on-your-website\">As stated earlier</a>, incorporating links throughout your pages is a must, but it's often something that's easily overlooked.</p> \n<p>Make sure that your anchor text includes more than just your keywords. The goal isn't to stuff in as many keywords as possible, but to make it easy for people to navigate your site.</p> \n<p>Use columns U through W to plan for these elements if you don't already have them, or to document how you'll improve them.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/on-page-seo-checklist-11-1.png?width=1500&amp;name=on-page-seo-checklist-11-1.png\" alt=\"on-page seo checklist add internal links\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<h3>16. Include external links.</h3> \n<p>It may seem counterintuitive to include external links throughout your page considering we just covered multiple reasons why <em>internal</em> linking is so important for on-page SEO. However, external links are also important.</p> \n<p>By externally linking, to credible and trustworthy sites, Google will know your page is also credible and trustworthy. Not only does Google want to know your site is well-referenced, but your visitors do, too.</p> \n<h3>17. Optimize for conversions.<strong><br></strong></h3> \n<p>If you're also not <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/conversion-rate-optimization\">optimizing your site</a> to increase the number of leads, subscribers, and/or customers you're attracting ... you're doing it wrong.</p> \n<p>Remember that each page of your website presents a conversion opportunity. That means every page of your website should include at least one call-to-action (CTA), though many pages may have multiple CTAs.</p> \n<p>Columns X through AF allow you to plan for conversions.</p> \n<p>Be sure that your site has a mix of CTAs for different <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/flywheel?_ga=2.122242699.1605302133.1560446833-1493293515.1553017609\">stages of the flywheel</a>.</p> \n<p>(<strong>Note</strong>: The On-Page SEO Template refers to the stages of the buying funnel — top of the funnel, middle of the funnel, and bottom of the funnel. If you are a HubSpot customer, you can even <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/how-personalization-works?hubs_post-cta=pillar_allphrase\" style=\"font-style: normal;\">use Smart Content</a> to display these specific CTAs only to people in a specific part of the funnel.)</p> \n<p>Also, as you add, edit, or update CTAs, be sure to note conversion rate changes in columns Z, AC, and AF.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/on-page-seo-checklist-12.png?width=1500&amp;name=on-page-seo-checklist-12.png\" alt=\"on-page seo checklist optimize your page for conversions\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<h2>Put Your On-Page SEO to Work</h2> \n<p>Once you finalize your SEO plans, implement these changes on your website or pass them along to someone to implement for you. This will take time to complete, so aim to work on 5 to 10 pages per week.</p> \n<p><strong>Remember</strong>: SEO is not a one-and-done deal. It's something you should continually improve upon. You should treat this On-Page SEO Template as a living, breathing document that will help guide your SEO strategy for months (or years) to come.</p> \n<p><em>Editor's Note: This post was originally

Needless to say, <u><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/how-to-use-twitter-for-business\">Twitter can be a powerful marketing tool for your business</a></u>, whether you’re new to the platform or growing steadily.</p> \n<p>Without further ado, let’s walk through some strategies and examples to help you perfect your Twitter presence.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p style=\"font-size: 13px; text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Twitter%20Ecommerce.png?width=1500&amp;name=Twitter%20Ecommerce.png\" alt=\"Twitter Ecommerce Strategies\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; margin: 0px auto;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=More%20on%20the%20@HubSpot%20blog%20post%20here:%20https://bit.ly/twecomm%20pic.twitter.com/Cxdb1wHPBC\"></a></span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"></span></p> \n<p style=\"font-size: 18px; text-align: center;\"><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=More%20on%20@HubSpot’s%20blog%20post%20here:%20https://bit.ly/twecomm%20pic.twitter.com/b6mJbJUB1I\">Share this image on Twitter!</a></span></em></p> \n<h2>Twitter Ecommerce Marketing Strategies</h2> \n<h3>1. Design an eye-catching profile.</h3> \n<p>To start, your Twitter profile should be optimized to make a great first impression and eventually generate sales. To do this, you’ll need consistent branding across your profile layout, which means your cover photo and profile picture should be complementary and visually appealing.</p> \n<p>The profile picture will likely be a picture of your logo or something that represents your business while the cover photo will further communicate your brand, mission, or message.</p> \n<p>As for your bio, this section is like the elevator pitch of your business. Think of this section as another opportunity to spark interest in those who come across your profile. You can use keywords relevant to your business here for a more targeted approach. Also, don’t forget to add a link to your ecommerce site so people know where to find your products!</p> \n<p>Lastly, you can use the pinned tweet feature to keep a tweet at the top of your profile. This feature is great for emphasizing a message or promoting new products.</p> \n<p>Here is an example of a well-optimized Twitter profile from <u><a href=\"https://twitter.com/away\">Away</a></u>, a travel &amp; luggage ecommerce company:</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202020-06-30%20at%204.41.02%20PM.png?width=1500&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202020-06-30%20at%204.41.02%20PM.png\" alt=\"twitter ecommerce marketing strategy featuring away's eye-catching profile\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"><a href=\"http://twitter.com/away\"><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\"><em>Source</em></span></a></p> \n<h3>2. Engage with your fanbase.</h3> \n<p>What’s great about Twitter is that it’s made for 24/7 interactions and constant activity, whereas very frequent posting from brands on platforms such as Instagram and Facebook may feel disingenuous and spam-like.</p> \n<p>This perk means you should always be interacting with your followers and fans. To do this, keep an eye out for your mentions (tweets including <strong>@yourusername</strong>) and respond to them. You can also retweet and favorite mentions to give a nod to these users.</p> \n<p>Another way to engage with your fanbase is by sending interactive tweets. Question prompts or <a href=\"https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-polls\"><u>Twitter polls</u></a>, tweets where you can create polls and see instant results, are perfect for this.</p> \n<p>You can ask about topics related to your product or even something entertaining relevant to your industry. Polls are also another way to gather opinions, so there’s some bonus market research! Here’s an example of a poll that <u><a href=\"https://twitter.com/OldSpice\">Old Spice</a></u> included in one of their Tweets:</p>  \n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"> \n <p>Are you Ultra Smooth or After Hours <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/SmellLikeYourOwnManMan?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#SmellLikeYourOwnManMan</a></p> — Old Spice (@OldSpice) \n <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OldSpice/status/1220453681310523392?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 23, 2020</a>\n</blockquote>  \n<h3>3. Grow your following.</h3> \n<p>Beyond your existing followers, it’s also important to grow your audience to increase your brand awareness and attract more customers to your ecommerce store. From a technical standpoint, having more followers also allows you to distribute your content and get the word out about whatever it is you sell faster.</p> \n<p>Garner new attention by participating in Twitter conversations relevant to your business. A strategic way to be part of the conversation on a large scale is by using trending Twitter hashtags. With trending hashtags in your tweets, you’re tapping into an entirely new network of people who may find interest in what you have to offer.</p> \n<p>On a smaller scale, you can reach new users by searching keywords relevant to your ecommerce business using Twitter’s search function. You’ll find conversations and questions about these keywords that you can offer some value in, which may lead someone to tap on your profile and give you a follow in return. You can go about this practice yourself, but here are some <u><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service/social-listening-tools\">social listening tools</a></u> to lend a hand.</p> \n<p>To acknowledge new followers, set up your account with automated direct messages, which send new followers a customized message. Your message should be friendly, welcoming, and show appreciation for the new follow. An automated DM that feels sincere can begin a relationship and move a prospective customer forward in their buyer’s journey.</p> \n<h3>4. Schedule your content.</h3> \n<p>With Twitter, the more active you are, the better. Having constant activity boosts your brand reputation and keeps your business top of mind for prospective customers, assuming your tweets are meaningful and speak to the audience. You can enlist a <u><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/social-media-calendar-tools\">social media management tool</a></u> to help you maintain your presence by scheduling your posts in advance.</p> \n<p>There are also <u><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/best-times-post-pin-tweet-social-media-infographic\">optimal posting times on Twitter</a></u> you can take advantage of when scheduling your content. B2C companies experience higher clickthrough rates on weekends while B2B companies see more success on weekdays. B2C companies also find the best times to post in the day to be 8 to 10 a.m., 12 p.m., and 7-9 p.m.</p> \n<p>Scheduling your content is also a great way to plan ahead for special occasions such as holidays and cultural events. Joining conversations regarding these topics is another opportunity to promote your ecommerce business, so think in advance of how you want to craft your message.</p> \n<p>Though scheduling your content can make your workflow more efficient, it doesn’t mean you can just schedule and forget. Twitter is a platform that is very much about the <em>here and now</em> as news and trending topics change by the hour. A mix of scheduled posts and live tweets are a perfect combination to grow your exposure.</p> \n<h3>5. Make the best of Twitter Ads.</h3> \n<p>Twitter offers a variety of ads depending on your objective. For ecommerce, the best types of ads are <strong>awareness</strong> and <strong>website click campaigns</strong> which promote your brand and generate conversions respectively.</p> \n<p>For awareness ads, you will be <u><a href=\"https://business.twitter.com/en/help/account-setup/campaigns-101.html\">billed for every 1,000 impressions</a></u> and for website ads, you will be <u><a href=\"https://business.twitter.com/en/help/account-setup/campaigns-101.html\">billed for every click to your website</a></u>. You can also use remarketing in your ads to target people similar to those who have visited your website.</p> \n<p>When creating ads, there are several tips to keep in mind for best performance. Twitter users crave short and sweet content, so keep your ads concise and to the point. You also want to make sure your ad copy is friendly, human, and approachable to match Twitter’s conversational atmosphere.</p> \n<p>Beyond text, visuals are also a helpful tool to use since images and videos can speak louder than words. They can also be a great way to provide better context for your audience. Below is an example from <u><a href=\"https://twitter.com/DlyHarvest\">Daily Harvest</a></u> of a website click campaign so you can see how all of these characteristics of an effective Twitter ad complement each other:</p>  \n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"> \n <p>Skip the shopping, chopping, and prepping and stock your freezer with delicious, good-for-you food built on organic fruits and vegetables.

Just a look at Alexa’s profile can provide a good idea of the account’s personality.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202020-06-30%20at%204.27.49%20PM.png?width=1500&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202020-06-30%20at%204.27.49%20PM.png\" alt=\"twitter ecommerce marketing example - Alexa\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"><a href=\"http://twitter.com/alexa99\"><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\"><em>Source</em></span></a></p> \n<p>To break it down, the branding of this account is well done because the bio is written in such a human tone and is comparable to the typical Twitter bio of any other person. Additionally, its Twitter handle, @alexa99, is like what you would find of the average Twitter user handle, making the account much more relatable.</p> \n<p>Alexa is also no stranger to sending polls and asking prompts to create engagement with its fans. Its prompts are also personal and lighthearted, so users who choose to share their opinions are happy to do so and feel like they are part of the conversation.</p>  \n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"> \n <p>🎵<br>🎵<br>🎶<br>┏┓ <br>┃┃╱╲ in<br>┃╱╱╲╲ this<br>╱╱╭╮╲╲ house<br>▔▏┗┛▕▔ we<br>╱▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔╲<br>dance when Alexa plays music<br>╱╱┏┳┓╭╮┏┳┓ ╲╲ <br>▔▏┗┻┛┃┃┗┻┛▕▔<br><br>What song are you asking DJ Alexa to play? 💬🎤</p> — Alexa (@alexa99) \n <a href=\"https://twitter.com/alexa99/status/1260967217513938945?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 14, 2020</a>\n</blockquote>  \n<h3>2. <a href=\"http://twitter.com/zappos\">Zappos</a></h3> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202020-06-30%20at%204.26.30%20PM.png?width=1500&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202020-06-30%20at%204.26.30%20PM.png\" alt=\"twitter ecommerce marketing example - Zappos\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"><a href=\"http://twitter.com/zappos\"><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\"><em>Source</em></span></a></p> \n<p>Zappos is known for its phenomenal customer service, which certainly carries over to their Twitter. The Zappos Twitter account managers focus on social listening and reply to their mentions or relevant tweets almost every hour, allowing them to win over new fans and continue to impress loyal followers.</p> \n<p>Below is an example of how Zappos uses social listening:</p>  \n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"> \n <p>We will let you in on a secret... Santa works for us over summer because he's bored. *DO</p> — Zappos.com (@Zappos) \n <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Zappos/status/1275133307727085568?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 22, 2020</a>\n</blockquote>  \n<p>  </p> \n<p>Although Zappos was not directly mentioned with an “@,” they were still quick to hop in and provide a solution for the potential customer. Zappos also put the cherry on top by providing a direct link to solve the customer’s problem, accelerating the customer’s buying process while standing out against its competitors.</p> \n<p>Above is another example of Zappos keeping in touch with customers. They replied in a witty way and also retweeted the customer’s mention. It may be easier to leave a satisfied customer be, but why not join the party and celebrate their satisfaction with them?</p> \n<h3>3. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WarbyParker\">Warby Parker</a></h3> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202020-06-30%20at%204.20.43%20PM.png?width=1500&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202020-06-30%20at%204.20.43%20PM.png\" alt=\"twitter ecommerce marketing example - warby parker\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/WarbyParker\"><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\"><em>Source</em></span></a></p> \n<p>Beyond celebrating customers, it’s also important to show customers your values and your support for them.

And, while Instagram hasn't reported its current number of business users, the platform reportedly hosted <a href=\"https://business.instagram.com/blog/25-million-businesses\">more than 25 million </a>of these accounts in late 2017.</p> \n<p>As the platform continues to grow and develop more interactive features, such as Instagram Stories and Instagram Live, businesses are regularly using it as a tool to humanize brands, recruit future employees, showcase products and company culture, delight customers, and generate new business.</p> \n<p>But here's the deal: Unless you're famous, it's really hard to amass a huge following on Instagram without some hard work.</p> \n<p>For the average person or business, growing your following takes time and attention on a daily basis.<span>Luckily, there are a few things you can do right away to collect at least 1,000 quality followers for your personal or professional Instagram account. It's all about knowing where to invest your time and effort. </span></p> \n<p>Let's discuss a few strategies that will help you gain those followers, from creating a follow-worthy Instagram profile, to using contests, to staying true to your brand. Whether you're gathering your first 1,000 followers or you just want 1,000 more, keep reading.</p> \n<h3>1. Create and optimize your profile.</h3> \n<p>First things first: customize your Instagram profile to make it look good, tell your potential followers who you are, and give them a reason to follow you.</p> \n<p>How? Start by making sure your username is recognizable and easily searchable — like your business name. If your business name is already taken, try keeping your business name as the first part of your username so that people searching for your business are more likely to come across you. For example, the Australian activewear line Lorna Jane uses the username <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/lornajaneactive/\">@lornajaneactive</a>.</p> \n<h4>Setting Up Your Account</h4> \n<p><strong>Step 1. </strong>Make sure to add your full business name to the “Name” fieldin the \"Options\" section. To find \"Options,\" tap the three lines in the top right corner of the IOS app, followed by \"Settings\" which will appear at the bottom of the screen next to a gear. If you're on Android, tap the three dots in the corner. Your business or name will appear under your profile picture and under your username in search.</p> \n<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Make sure your profile is public. To make your profile public, open Instagram, open \"Options,\" and make sure \"Private Account\" is turned off.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/private.jpg?width=639&amp;name=private.jpg\" alt=\"Switch your Instagram account from private to public to gain more followers.\" title=\"private.jpg\" width=\"639\" style=\"width: 639px;\"></p> \n<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Choose a profile picture that's on-brand with your other social networks, like your company logo.</p> \n<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Fill your bio with delightful, actionable, and informative information about your brand. Information like this lets people know what you're about and gives them a reason to follow you. Include who you are and what you do, and be sure to add a hint of personality.</p> \n<p>Here are a few examples for inspiration:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/wework/\">@WeWork</a>: \"Make a life, not just a living.\"</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/oreo/\">@Oreo</a>: \"Playful moments from your favorite cookie.\"</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/califiafarms/\">@CalifiaFarms</a>: \"Something different, something better. Let us show you what plants can do.\"</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/staples/\">@Staples</a>: \"We help teams find fulfillment in Worklife by connecting people, ideas and solutions.\"</li> \n</ul> \n<p><strong>Step 5.</strong> Add a link to your bio to make it easy for people to go straight from Instagram to your website if they want to. The space allotted for URLs is precious real estate. When you receive 10,000 followers, you can add swipe up links to your Instagram Stories. Until then, your bio is the only place within Instagram where you can place a clickable link, so use it wisely. We recommend using a shortened, customized <a href=\"https://bitly.com/\">Bitly</a> link to make it more clickable.</p> \n<p><strong>Step 6.</strong> Finally, enable notifications so you can see when people share or comment on your photos. This'll let you engage with them more quickly— just like a lot of companies do on Twitter. To enable notifications, go to \"Options\" and then \"Push Notification Settings.\" Select \"From Everyone\" for every category.</p> \n<p>A word to the wise: We <em>don't</em> recommend you link your Instagram account to Twitter and Facebook so your Instagram posts are automatically published on those other accounts. Post types are different.</p> \n<h3>2. Designate a content creator.</h3> \n<p>Just like there should be one (<em>maybe</em> two) people managing your other social media accounts, there should only be one or two people managing your Instagram account. If possible, choose someone who has experience using a personal Instagram account, and therefore \"gets\" the platform — and be sure they know all the handy features Instagram has to offer.</p> \n<p>If you work for a large organization, you might find that a lot of people want to have a say in what's posted. That's when an organized request or guidelines document comes in hand. This document should inform people how to request a post on your Instagram account, when, the value of the post, and why.</p> \n<h3>3. Follow photography and editing best practices.</h3> \n<p>On Instagram, post quality matters. A <em>lot. </em>Your Twitter followers might forgive a few bad tweets, but a bad photo on Instagram is a big no-no.</p> \n<p>Fortunately, you don't have to take a photography course to be a good Instagram poster — nor do you have to practice for weeks before you start. But you <em>should</em> get familiar with basic photography tips and photo editing apps.</p> \n<h4>Photography Best Practices</h4> \n<p>Since Instagram is a mobile app, chances are, most of the photos you post to Instagram will be taken on your mobile device. That's not just okay; it's expected. While some brands use professional photography for their Instagram photos, most use smartphones — and that's the vibe that Instagram is meant for, anyway.</p> \n<p>Here are some highlights:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Focus on one subject at a time.</li> \n <li>Embrace negative space.</li> \n <li>Find interesting perspectives.</li> \n <li>Look for symmetry.</li> \n <li>Capture small details.</li> \n <li>Make your followers laugh.</li> \n</ul> \n<h4>Edit photos before you post.</h4> \n<p>Instagram has some basic editing capabilities, but oftentimes, they aren't adequate to make a picture really, really great. Most of your photos should go through at least one or two other photo editing apps on your mobile phone before you open them in Instagram for the first time.</p> \n<p>Additionally, consider creating a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/instagram-themes\">cohesive Instagram theme</a> across your feed, so anyone visiting your account for the first time can get a sense for your brand.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>4. Set a regular posting schedule.</h3> \n<p>Once you've created and optimized your profile, have someone manning it, and know a thing or two about phone photography and photo editing, it's time to start posting.</p> \n<p>It's a good idea to have a solid number of great posts up — maybe 15 or so— before you start really engaging people and working down this list. That way, when people visit your profile, they'll see a full screen of photos instead of just a handful, so they know you'll be posting great content regularly.</p> \n<p>To start posting on Instagram, first <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33415/the-social-media-publishing-schedule-every-marketer-needs-template.aspx?_ga=2.204196755.2081588909.1558108101-1894039831.1558108101\">download this social media content calendar template</a> and start planning out your Instagram posts. Over time, you'll want to build up a backlog of photos for times of need, like the weekends or when you go on vacation.</p> \n<p>Keep your target persona in mind when you first start planning out your posting schedule, as that can drastically change your posting timing and frequency— especially if you're targeting an audience in a different time zone. (<a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/free-template-creating-buyer-personas?_ga=2.46085415.2018751541.1558299706-983944916.1546275206\">Download this free template for creating buyer personas</a> if you don't have a few already.)</p> \n<p>Optimizing your schedule for your specific audience might take time and experimentation.</p> \n<p>Here are a few of <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/instagram-best-time-post\">our best practices</a>:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>The very best times to post on Instagram seem to beMondays and Thursdays at any time <strong>except between 3:00–4:00 p.m.</strong>in the time zone of your target persona. (For a United States audience, your best bet is to combine Eastern and Central time zones, For audiences located outside the U.S., use whichever time zones your target audience uses.)</li> \n <li>Posting at 5:00 a.m. CDT from Tuesday to Friday generates some of the highest engagement. This is because people tend to check their phones when they wake up.</li> \n <li>If you post on weekends, try to do so around 11:00 a.m, CDT on Saturday.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Because Instagram is primarily an app for use on mobile devices, users tend to use the network all the time, any time. According to a recent <a href=\"https://www.pewinternet.org/2018/03/01/social-media-use-in-2018/\">Pew Research study</a>, a majority of U.S. Instagram users are on the app daily, although many users engage with content more during off-work hours than during the workday.</p> \n<p>Some businesses have also seen success with posting at 2:00 a.m., 5:00 p.m., and Wednesdays at 7:00 p.m. Experiment with these to see if they work with your audience.</p> \n<h3>5. Curate some of your content.</h3> \n<p>Although it's best to have only one or two people manning your account, one or two people can't be everywhere at once taking photos. What about that fun sushi night the engineers had last night? Or the event your head of sales spoke at earlier this week?</p> \n<p>There's a whole breadth of content you'll want to post to Instagram, and more often than not, one person won't be able to keep track of it all.</p> \n<p>One solution? Create a system where you can curate photos and content from members of your team. There are a few ways to do this. One is to create a specific email address for employees to send their photos, short videos, memes, hyper-lapses, and so on.</p> \n<p>Just encourage people to put a subject line on these emails so you can more easily sort through the photos they're sending. While this doesn't seem like the smoothest way to curate photos, it's actually the easiest for the people sending you photos— and the easier you can make it for them to send content, the more content you'll get.</p> \n<p>If your team shares a Box or Dropbox account, you could also create a shared folder where people can automatically drop their photos and videos. This just makes a few more steps for the people sending you the content, and not everyone might have that app downloaded on their phones.</p> \n<h3>6.Use a consistent, platform-specific brand voice.</h3> \n<p>Photos and videos might be the most important part of your Instagram posts, but captions, comments, and other text should never be an afterthought. If you're managing a channel for a brand or have more than one Instagram manager, consider developing a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/brand-voice\">consistent voice </a>that humanizes your brand.</p> \n<p>This shows potential followers that you are credible and relatable, rather than formal or intimidating.</p> \n<p>When developing a voice, you should keep the platform and your audience in mind. For example, many influencers and prominent accounts on Instagram have a very casual voice and style, but still remain professional and on-brand. Once you've got your voice down, make sure it stays consistent and natural in your captions, comments, messages and your bio.</p> \n<h3>7. Write engaging, shareable captions.</h3> \n<p>Captions are an essential part of your post—the icing on the cake, if you will. Consistently great captions can do wonders for humanizing your brand, winning over followers, and making your content more shareable— thereby giving you more exposure.</p> \n<p>Here are a few things you might see in a winning Instagram caption:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Clever or Witty Comments</li> \n <li>Calls to Action</li> \n <li>Relevant Emojis</li> \n <li>Hashtags</li> \n</ul> \n<div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"width: 100%; height: auto; position: relative; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; max-width: 560px; max-height: 315px; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\"> \n <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 0;\">\n  <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/498VDB076eY\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n </div> \n</div> \n<h4>Clever or Witty Comments</h4> \n<p>Some brands and influencers have used clever or witty captions, or even audience-appropriate jokes to further humanize themselves on Instagram.</p> \n<p>My colleague <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/author/kelly-hendrickson\">Kelly Hendrickson</a>, HubSpot's Social Media Manager, says that she loves <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/netflix/\">Netflix's account</a> and sub-accounts, particularly because of the post captions: \"They have such a clear brand voice, and you laugh along with them. They're in on the joke, just like one of your friends.\"</p> \n<p>Here's one example where Netflix makes a meme to describe what it's like \"watching my friends' stories ... [and] hoping to catch a glimpse of myself\":</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/how-grow-instagram-followers-2.jpg?width=466&amp;name=how-grow-instagram-followers-2.jpg\" alt=\"how-grow-instagram-followers-2\" width=\"466\" style=\"width: 466px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"> Netflix's voice is casual, trendy, and humorous while still staying on brand. In the post above, the caption is funny, authentic, and relatable: who <em>hasn't</em> flipped through a friend's Instagram Story with the hope that you'll be featured?&nbsp;</p> \n<h4>Calls to Action</h4> \n<p>Another way to increase the shareability of your caption and engage your followers is to ask questions or have some sort of call-to-action in the captions of your photos. For example, you might say, \"Double-tap if you find this funny,\" or \"Share your story in the comments.\"</p> \n<p>In the example below, we asked followers of the @HubSpot Instagram account to leave a comment with a book that's had a positive impact on their work, along with tagging the author:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/how-gain-instagram-followers-2.jpg?width=466&amp;name=how-gain-instagram-followers-2.jpg\" alt=\"how-gain-instagram-followers\" width=\"466\" style=\"width: 466px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<h4>Relevant Emojis</h4> \n<p>According to a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/best-emojis?_ga=2.76430614.2018751541.1558299706-983944916.1546275206\">recent study</a>, certain emojis can actually spike engagement such as likes, comments, and shares on platforms including Instagram.</p> \n<p>Adding just a few relevant emojis can add even more personality to your posts. It could also make them even more noticeable on an Instagram feed. In the post below, Danielle Gray, a beauty expert with over 50K followers, (<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/stylenbeautydoc/\">@Stylenbeautydoc</a>) includes witty text with relevant emojis to make the post pop.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/gain-followers-instagram.jpg?width=466&amp;name=gain-followers-instagram.jpg\" alt=\"gain-followers-instagram\" width=\"466\" style=\"width: 466px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>Along with the three items listed above, you'll also want to include hashtags.</p> \n<h3>8. Optimize posts with relevant hashtags.</h3> \n<p>On Instagram, a hashtag ties the conversations of different users who wouldn't already be connected into a single stream. If you use relevant hashtags, your posts will get exposure to a wider audience than the people who already follow you or know about your brand.</p> \n<p>The key to using hashtags effectively is to use them smartly and sparingly. Try to limit the number of hashtags per caption to around three. Similarly, don't use \"like for like\" hashtags, like #like4like or #like4likes. This is a dirty tactic that'll leave you with a whole bunch of low-quality followers.</p> \n<p>To find the hashtags your audience might be using, do a little research on relevant hashtags in your niche or industry. The easiest way to do this research is in the Instagram app itself, in the \"explore\" tab (i.e. the magnifying glass icon).</p> \n<p>When you search for one hashtag, it'll show you a list of related hashtags at the top of your screen. For example, when I search for #digitalmarketingstrategy on Instagram, it shows me relevant hashtags like #digitalmarketingexpert, #digitalmarketing, and so on.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/gain-instagram-followers.jpg?width=466&amp;name=gain-instagram-followers.jpg\" alt=\"gain-instagram-followers\" width=\"466\" style=\"width: 466px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">To help relate to your followers on a personal level, you might consider hopping on hashtag trends like #tbt (\"Throwback Thursday\"), #MotivationMonday, #TransformationTuesday, or hashtags that are trending at any given time.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Here's a post from <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/updogkombucha/\">@updogkombucha</a>, a kombucha company with over 10K followers on its Instagram account, using the #InternationalWomensDay hashtag:</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/instagram-followers-grow.jpg?width=466&amp;name=instagram-followers-grow.jpg\" alt=\"instagram-followers-grow\" width=\"466\" style=\"width: 466px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Once you build up a bit of a following, you can try creating your own hashtags — like your company name or a slogan that applies to a lot of your photos. This is a great way to build up your brand on the platform and build a more cohesive presence.</p> \n<h3>1. Engage with users through follows, likes, and comments.</h3> \n<p>Instagram is very much a community, and one great way to get involved in that community is to find people who post pictures that interest you, and follow their accounts and interact with their content. It's the most natural way to draw attention to your own Instagram account. It may also get your foot in the door in the platform's community.</p> \n<p>That does two things for you: for one, when they get the notification that you've followed them, they might check out your account and decide whether or not to follow you. (This is why it's important to have some great content on there before you start reaching out to others.)</p> \n<p>Secondly, it means you'll be seeing their recent posts in your feed, so you can Like and interact with them if you choose to.</p> \n<p>As you build a following, celebrate your followers and show you appreciate them by responding to their comments, and even following them and engaging with their own posts.</p> \n<h3>2. Cross-promote with users who have audiences similar to your own.</h3> \n<p>Once you build a solid relationship with some of the folks behind these accounts that have a similar audience to your own, you might ask to do some co-promotion on each others' accounts.</p> \n<p>The more natural and less spammy you can make the content of these cross-promotions— especially the captions — the better. It also helps to be picky about them, and don't do them very often.</p> \n<p>For instance, influencer <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/belleoftheball45/\">@Belleoftheball45</a>, who has more than 70K followers, posted a sponsored image of herself on the beach with Coppertone sunscreen. <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/coppertoneusa/\">@CoppertoneUSA</a> then&nbsp;re-posted the image. By cross-promoting, both Abigail and Coppertone can reach new audiences and grow their followings.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/instagram-grow-followers-2.jpg?width=466&amp;name=instagram-grow-followers-2.jpg\" alt=\"instagram-grow-followers-2\" width=\"466\" style=\"width: 466px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/instagram-followers-1.jpg?width=466&amp;name=instagram-followers-1.jpg\" alt=\"instagram-followers-1\" width=\"466\" style=\"width: 466px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>When someone searches for the hashtag #Coppertoneusa, or takes a look at Coppertone USA's Instagram, they'll find Abigail's account and might choose to follow her. At the same time, any followers of Abigail might click on the post and send Coppertone a follow, as well, particularly since Abigail is promoting Coppertone products. It's a win-win for both accounts.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>3. Run Instagram contests to encourage engagement.</h3> \n<p>Another great way to expand your reach while increasing engagement on your photos is to publish a post promoting a contest, and then ask people to follow your account and Like or comment on the photo in order to enter.</p> \n<p>I mean, come on ... who doesn't love to win free stuff?&nbsp;</p> \n<p>You might add a UGC (User-Generated Content) element to the contest, too, where people post a photo of their own and use a specific hashtag along with following your account.</p> \n<p>Here's an example of a post from <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/playabowlsnortheastern/\">@PlayaBowlsNortheastern</a>, where followers were asked to follow each of Playa Bowls' three business accounts, and tag a friend to follow each account, as well. In exchange, follower's have the chance to win a free bowl:&nbsp;</p> \n<h3><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/followers-instagram-gain-more.jpg?width=466&amp;name=followers-instagram-gain-more.jpg\" alt=\"followers-instagram-gain-more\" width=\"466\" style=\"width: 466px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></h3> \n<h3>4. Use Instagram Stories and explore its interactive features.</h3> \n<p>Instagram has always offered the opportunity to post beautiful, curated photos to represent your brand. However, with the introduction of ephemeral <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/instagram-stories-guide#sm.00006uybatuk9erxqe91juzya6sra\">Instagram Stories</a>, brands can also share on-the-fly, behind-the-scenes looks for 24 hours that may not be as polished as a published photo, but give your brand more personality on the platform.</p> \n<p>One look at Snapchat's <a href=\"http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-28/snapchat-user-content-fuels-jump-to-10-billion-daily-video-views\">explosion in popularity </a>demonstrates that social media users are clearly responding positively to ephemeral photo and video sharing. Instagram Stories let brands engage with users in different ways to cultivate brand loyalty and appeal.</p> \n<p>Although Snapchat pioneered this feature, Instagram Stories now has over<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/28/instagram-stories-daily-active-users-double-snapchats.html\">400 million daily users</a>, which is double the amount ofSnap's user base.</p> \n<p>Along with sharing video clips and static images through Instagram Stories, users can also use <a href=\"https://instagram-press.com/blog/2017/10/03/introducing-polls-in-instagram-stories/\">interactive features like polls </a>to gain more engagement and learn more about their Instagram audiences. Once a user is verified or has over 10,000 followers, they can even <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/add-link-instagram-story\">include a link to a webpage within a story</a>.</p> \n<div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"width: 100%; height: auto; position: relative; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; max-width: 640px; max-height: 360px; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\"> \n <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 0;\">\n  <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xv-8hDlPfz8\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n </div> \n</div> \n<h4>How Brands Can Use Instagram Stories</h4> \n<p>Instagram Stories disappear after 24 hours, unless they are marked as a \"Featured Story.\" Featured stories will show up at the top of your profile between the photo feed and your bio. We can't embed Instagram Stories just yet, but you can view <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/hubspot/\">HubSpot's Instagram page </a>to see what we've featured.</p> \n<p>Here are a few other brands we recommend following to see what they're sharing:</p> \n<p><strong>Rachel Brathen</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/yoga_girl/\">@yoga_girl</a>) is a yoga teacher and entrepreneur in Aruba who uses Instagram Stories to document the behind-the-scenes action of building a yoga studio. While her Instagram portfolio features beautiful, professional photos and videos of her in yoga poses, her Stories feature her dog sitting in on staff meetings, her team unwrapping amethyst crystals to decorate her studio, and artists painting the walls.</p> \n<p>She uses Stories to showcase the other side of her brand to her 2 million followers in an authentic and unpolished way, and to keep her followers apprised of what she does every day (besides yoga, of course).</p> \n<p><strong>Dana Shultz</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/minimalistbaker/\">@miniamlistbaker</a>) publishes easy vegan and gluten-free recipes on her blog. Her Stories feature neat how-to videos of her making breakfast and testing out new recipes in her kitchen. The behind-the-scenes aspect of her Stories provide a lot of human context for her blog's brand, and <a href=\"https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/articles/i-want-to-do-micro-moments.html\">everybody loves</a> a good how-to video.</p> \n<p><strong>Casper </strong>(<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/casper/\">@casper</a>) publishes quirky Instagram content to advertise their mattresses -- without overtly doing so. The main theme of their content? Staying in is better than going out (because you can stay in and lay on a comfy Casper mattress, naturally).</p> \n<p>They've even <a href=\"http://latenightsnaphacks.com/\">created a gallery</a> for followers to use as backdrops for their Snapchat and Instagram stories to make it look like they're out at a party, when they're really laying in bed. One of their latest Instagram Stories featured someone watching \"The Sopranos\" in bed, with the caption:\"Who needs plans when you have five more seasons?\" This video supports Casper's campaign to stay in bed with a very real look at what <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/12/business/nielsen-reports-2-in-5-us-households-subscribe-to-video-streaming-services.html\">millions of people</a> do when they're hanging out at home.</p> \n<p>Here are our tips for using Instagram Stories for your brand:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Whether it's funny, sad, or unique, be authentic</strong>. Your photo gallery is where content can be perfect and polished. Instagram Stories are for the raw, unscripted, and un-retouched. Use Stories to share the other side of your brand that followers might not be able to glean elsewhere. Do you have a dog-friendly office? Is your team trying out the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27NRxZet2w8\">Mannequin Challenge</a>? Start filming to showcase the more human side of your brand.</li> \n <li><strong>Go behind-the-scenes</strong>. These are by far our favorite type of content for ephemeral video sharing. Show followers what goes into the planning of an event or the launching of a product, and make it fun. Your followers want to feel included and in-the-know, and you could use Stories to cultivate a brand loyalty program that only rewards people who check out your content.</li> \n <li><strong>Embrace interactivity.</strong> As mentioned above, Instagram allows you to add interactive stickers to your stories. For example, you can ask your audience to vote in a poll, rate something on a sliding scale, or send you burning questions.These features might help you learn about your audience while also engaging with them.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>5. Use the Live Video feature.</h3> \n<p>Instagram also lets users record and share live videos, another content format that's proven to be hugely popular on other social networks. What's unique about live videos on Instagram? They disappear when users stop filming.</p> \n<p>This authentic, bi-directional experience lets brands share unscripted, raw moments with their audience to incorporate human elements into a social media platform that's highly edited and polished in its traditional use.</p> \n<p>Since the Live feature launched, Instagram has added even more features that may enable more engagement or interactions from viewers. For example, users can now <a href=\"https://instagram-press.com/blog/2018/12/18/new-ways-to-interact-on-instagram/\">launch live video Q&amp;As or add music to live streams</a>.</p> \n<div class=\"video-container-responsive\">\n Live video is a growing trend across a variety of social media platforms, so if something interesting is happening, start rolling. Whether it's a team birthday party, a staff meeting, or a cute animal, your devoted followers want to see what you're up to every day.\n</div> \n<h3>6. Share your profile link on your website and social media channels.</h3> \n<p>Place a follow button on your homepage, your \"About Us\" page, and various other places on your website. Consider adding an Instagram badge to your website that hyperlinks to your account.</p> \n<p>Here's what the badge could look like:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/instagramicon.jpg?width=544&amp;name=instagramicon.jpg\" alt=\"instagramicon\" width=\"544\" style=\"width: 544px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<p>If your brand has brick-and-mortar locations, put out a good ol' print call-to-action letting people know you have an Instagram account and encouraging them to follow you.</p> \n<p>Also, be sure to promote your Instagram account on your other social media accounts. Chances are, the folks who already follow you on Facebook and Twitter will also follow you on Instagram without much prodding. Let those followers know you're on Instagram and encourage them to follow you there by including a link to your Instagram account in the bios and posts of those other social media accounts.</p> \n<p>So give it a shot: Make a profile and start posting, testing, tweaking, and promoting your account. Garnering a following on Instagram won't happen overnight, but the stronger of a foundation you create on your account in in your niche Instagram community, the higher quality your followers will be.</p> \n<h3>7. Post user-generated content.</h3> \n<p>Similar to cross-promotion, brands can publish user-generated content to show appreciation for existing customers, while appealing to that follower's audience.</p> \n<p>If I see a regular person endorsing a product on Instagram, I'm more likely to believe they <em>actually&nbsp;</em>really like the product — but if I see a celebrity on TV promoting the product, I'm more doubtful. Ultimately, user-generated content can be an excellent strategy when trying to increase brand awareness and trust in your products or services.</p> \n<p>For instance, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/daveskillerbread/\">@Daveskillerbread</a> posted an image of a customer holding one of the company's products — but not just any customer. They posted an image of <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/caitlynhunter_nutrition/\">@Caitlynhunter_nutrition</a>, a registered dietitian with 1,730 followers of her own:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/insta-followers-grow.jpg?width=466&amp;name=insta-followers-grow.jpg\" alt=\"insta-followers-grow\" width=\"466\" style=\"width: 466px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">Posting an Caitlyn holding Dave's bread is a smart move. First, she's a dietician with an Instagram account full of actionable health-oriented tips. She's unlikely to endorse a product she doesn't truly believe will serve her audience, who are most likely looking for tips related to health and wellness — which means her audience is the <em>perfect&nbsp;</em>demographic for Dave's Killer Bread to reach.</p> \n<p>Plus, Dave's Killer Bread's audience, another group of health-minded individuals, will likely be interested in following Caitlyn for more health-related tips. Simply put, the two brands have similar audiences and brands that align well, which is why it's a good opportunity for Dave's Killer Bread to use Caitlyn's content as content for their own account.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>8. Diversify your audience to resonate with different types of users.</h3> \n<p>As your followers grow, it can be tricky to identify what types of content will appeal to them. This is why it might be a good idea to divide your audience into sub-groups and target your content to various demographics.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>For instance, if you have 200K followers, those followers probably come from different regions of the world, have different interests and hobbies, and even different careers. Rather than trying to post all-encompassing content that will satisfy&nbsp;<em>all&nbsp;</em>your followers at once, consider conducting some <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/instagram-analytics-tools\">analytics research</a> to separate them into smaller sub-groups.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Take Starbucks as a good example of this. <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/starbucks/\">@Starbucks</a> has 18 million followers. There's no way the global coffee brand can post content to satisfy 18 million people at once — and it doesn't try to. Instead, Starbucks regularly posts more exclusive content geared towards particular groups, such as this post they published recently celebrating #TeacherAppreciationWeek:&nbsp;</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/instagram-gain-more-followers.jpg?width=466&amp;name=instagram-gain-more-followers.jpg\" alt=\"instagram-gain-more-followers\" width=\"466\" style=\"width: 466px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>This post won't appeal to the majority of Starbucks followers who <em>aren't</em> teachers, but that's okay. You don't always need to post content to please everyone. Instead, you want to consistently demonstrate your brand's ability to connect and engage with sub-groups and post what aligns with your own <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/company-values\">brand's values</a>.</p> \n<p>Education is something that matters to Starbucks, so by posting about teachers, they're doing more to demonstrate their own values than they are appealing to everyone. Which is kind of the point, isn't it?&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>9. Apply for a verification badge.</h3> \n<p>When an account on Instagram is verified, it has a blue dot, called a badge, next to the username. When another user comes across this profile or finds the verified username in search, the blue dot confirms to them that the account is the business, individual, or brand that it's claiming to be.</p> \n<p>While Instagram has a list of eligibility requirements for the badge, the platform does allow users to apply for one. You can learn more about that process <a href=\"https://help.instagram.com/854227311295302\">inInstagram's help center</a>.</p> \n<h3>Quality Over Quantity Still Matters</h3> \n<p>Ultimately, it's important to focus less on the number of followers you have, and <i>more </i>on the quality of content you create. Your audience will grow naturally over the long-haul if you put effort and time into creating engaging, informative, or inspirational content without worrying about \"quick fixes\" for boosts in followers.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Plus, if you think about it, your followers don't continue to follow you because of the size of your audience. They continue to follow you because of the content you create.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Sure, maybe I've <i>initially</i> followed an influencer because she had 200K followers, which signified to me that she was worth following — otherwise, why would 200K people be looking at her content?&nbsp;</p> \n<p>But that doesn't mean I've <em>continued</em> to follow influencers or brands because of the size of their audience. I've unfollowed plenty of mega-influencers or brands with thousands — if not millions — of followers, simply because I was no longer impressed with their posts.</p> \n<p>You want to play the long game on Instagram, and that starts with focusing on what you <em>can</em> control — namely, the quality of the content you produce, the messages you promote, and the brand you build.</p> \n<p>Ironically, I'm willing to bet the less you worry about the number of followers you have, the more community members you'll attract.&nbsp;</p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fgain-instagram-followers&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 24 Jul 2020 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/gain-more-instagram-followers.jpg#keepProtocol","linkMd5":"7bf544018269eb1b5030fcebe896623a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn57@2020_3/2020-07-30/1596118303642_fdfe692383037a5b.webp","metaImg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/gain-more-instagram-followers.jpg#keepProtocol","author":"Caroline Forsey","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/private.jpg?width=639&name=private.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn5@2020_2/2020-07-30/1596118307232_db7e7e313b73ae29.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/how-grow-instagram-followers-2.jpg?width=466&name=how-grow-instagram-followers-2.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn41@2020_6/2020-07-30/1596118304955_95dc5ed23cd40675.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/how-gain-instagram-followers-2.jpg?width=466&name=how-gain-instagram-followers-2.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn53@2020_3/2020-07-30/1596118309327_465ee3c5afddef23.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/gain-followers-instagram.jpg?width=466&name=gain-followers-instagram.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn53@2020_1/2020-07-30/1596118312039_1f98a22c5750d61a.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/gain-instagram-followers.jpg?width=466&name=gain-instagram-followers.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn37@2020_1/2020-07-30/1596118307432_452e4758e7ac231d.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/instagram-followers-grow.jpg?width=466&name=instagram-followers-grow.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn33@2020_1/2020-07-30/1596118310875_fe022c2ade51c1a6.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/instagram-grow-followers-2.jpg?width=466&name=instagram-grow-followers-2.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn49@2020_2/2020-07-30/1596118311247_c1a8b9b3cd5af6ba.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/instagram-followers-1.jpg?width=466&name=instagram-followers-1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn85@2020_3/2020-07-30/1596118306279_43657d0c622b356a.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/followers-instagram-gain-more.jpg?width=466&name=followers-instagram-gain-more.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn13@2020_3/2020-07-30/1596118313404_9c83a724f3ee4d22.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/instagramicon.jpg?width=544&name=instagramicon.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn57@2020_6/2020-07-30/1596118304826_d85d60262b671a2b.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/insta-followers-grow.jpg?width=466&name=insta-followers-grow.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn2@2020_4/2020-07-30/1596118309920_c5287bb205a6c0c8.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/instagram-gain-more-followers.jpg?width=466&name=instagram-gain-more-followers.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn77@2020_6/2020-07-30/1596118311265_51b4ed917ddc8247.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fgain-instagram-followers&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn90@2020_1/2020-07-30/1596118310665_09489e6b5c3b66ff.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-07-30 22:11:40","updatedTime":"2020-07-30 14:11:40","title":"6 Tips for Creating Content That Spreads Naturally","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33906/6-tips-for-creating-content-that-spreads-naturally.aspx","description":"<div class=\"hs-migrated-cms-post\"> \n <p>We’ve all been there — you hit publish on a blog post and expect the social shares, page views, and agreeable comments to start rolling in. But sometimes you get pure silence (or crickets 🦗) in response.</p>  \n <p>Using social media and content to market your business isn't a new concept, so doing the bare minimum won't cut it.</p> \n <p>Don't believe me? Think about how often content is shared across the web — for instance, there are <a href=\"https://blog.hootsuite.com/facebook-demographics/\">over 2.45 billion Facebook users</a> and <a href=\"https://www.dsayce.com/social-media/tweets-day/\">over 500 million Tweets shared per day</a> on Twitter — and that's only two of the several popular social platforms. Needless to say, there's a lot of content <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">everywhere</span>&nbsp;... and as a result, a ton of noise.</p> \n <p>It takes more than simply publishing content to stand out among your target audience and competitors. To prepare you for success from the get-go, here are six ways to cut through all of that noise and make sure your content comes out on top every time — no additional marketing effort required.</p> \n <p style=\"font-size: 15px; text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Content%20Spread-1.png?width=1500&amp;name=Content%20Spread-1.png\" alt=\"create content that spreads\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n <p style=\"font-size: 18px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=More%20on%20@HubSpot’s%20blog%20post%20here:%20https://bit.ly/6content%20pic.twitter.com/h9JNTUPJKA\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em>Share this image on Twitter!</em></span></a></p> \n <h2><strong>6 Ways to Create Content That Markets Itself</strong></h2> \n <p>Follow these tips to ensure your business's content stands out, spreads naturally, and markets itself among your target audience, buyer personas, leads, and customers.</p> \n <h4><strong>1)</strong> <strong>Don't try something new.</strong></h4> \n <p>Wait. What?</p> \n <p>Seriously. There's no reason you'd need to start from scratch with a completely new content approach every time you create blog.</p> \n <p>You already have content that's getting discovered on its own — so, learn from those efforts. (Remember, sometimes you can simply work smarter rather than harder.)</p> \n <p>Review your analytics and look for the posts that are generating the most views, shares, and leads, to determine how you can replicate that success.</p> \n <p>For instance, use <a href=\"https://knowledge.hubspot.com/reports/analyze-your-landing-page-website-page-and-blog-performance\">web analytics</a> to identify your blog's sweet spots. From there, create a blog <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/business-blog-editorial-calendar-templates\">editorial calendar</a> with topics that will help you replicate past successes — whether it's a post's format, subject matter, title, author, or something else entirely.</p> \n <h4><strong>2) Surprise people.</strong></h4> \n <p>… Or make them happy, sad, afraid, angry, even disgusted!</p> \n <p>Why? Because, <strong>in content, there's a strong relationship between virality and emotion.</strong></p> \n <p>While I'm sure disgust or anger aren't really the kinds of reactions you want associated with your brand, that's not exactly the point here. The lesson is that content will be able to market itself if it provokes a strong emotional reaction with the audience. After they consume your content, they'll feel like they <em>have</em> to share it with others so they have the opportunity to feel the same emotion.</p> \n <p>Consider content you've read or created that provoked an emotion and action in the past — use this as inspiration for <em>your</em> content.</p> \n <h4><strong>3) Nail your headline.<br></strong></h4> \n <p>How can you increase the <span>likelihood</span> someone will click on a link to open your content?</p> \n <p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/types-of-blog-headlines\">A great headline</a> that's attention-grabbing and intriguing. No matter the subject of your content, a great headline will help a piece of content get opened more and spread further.</p> \n <p>So ... what makes a great headline? It's similar to writing a great subject line for email marketing. Think about these <a href=\"http://www.copyblogger.com/email-subject-lines/\">four U's</a> in regards to your subject lines and headlines:</p> \n <ul> \n  <li><strong>Useful:</strong> Why is the blog post valuable?</li> \n  <li><strong>Ultra-specific:</strong> What can I expect to learn from the blog post?</li> \n  <li><strong>Unique:</strong> Why is this blog post compelling and unique?</li> \n  <li><strong>Urgent:</strong> Why should I read this <em>now</em>?</li> \n </ul> \n <p>Be sure to incorporate all four of these qualities in every headline that you write so your audience will want to open and share your content.</p> \n <h4><strong>4) Show don't tell.</strong></h4> \n <p>Today's <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/visual-content-marketing-strategy\">social media platforms reward visual content</a> — this should be a major element of your content strategy. After all, visuals are proven to increase shares and engagement.</p> \n <p>Whether it's unique photos, graphic design content, video content, or branding visuals you share via blog, site page, email, social media, etc., they will help you increase conversions while offering an engaging and appealing presentation of your content.</p> \n <p><span>Not to mention, these days you don't need to be a designer to create and share professional-looking visuals. In fact, there are plenty of easy-to-use <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/free-visual-content-tools-list\">design tools</a></span><span> on the market for people with any level of design knowledge.<br></span></p> \n <h4><strong>5) Enable your blog to market your content.</strong></h4> \n <p>More social media <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-increase-referral-traffic-and-get-more-leads\">referral traffic</a> coming to your site means more new visitors arriving via that content for the very first time.</p> \n <p>However, these new visitors likely don't know much about your business — meaning, you need to capture their interest and gain their trust before they're ready to become evangelists of your content, too.</p> \n <p>Consider how you can use your blog's real estate to improve the presentation of your content and offer further recommendations that will earn new visitors' attention and loyalty.</p> \n <p>For example, add related-content recommendations at the bottom of every post. By tailoring recommendations to audience members, you'll increase page views, time-on-site, and engagement.</p> \n <p>This is what the \"Related Articles\" section at the bottom of HubSpot's Blog posts look like:</p> \n <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202020-04-20%20at%204.31.14%20PM.png?width=1500&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202020-04-20%20at%204.31.14%20PM.png\" alt=\"related blog articles example\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-creation\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Source</span></em></a></p> \n <p>In addition to recommendation widgets, add <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/29544/the-ultimate-cheat-sheet-for-creating-social-media-buttons.aspx\">social follow and sharing buttons and modules</a> to your content. This allows your audience members to click a button, no matter where they're consuming your content, and immediately share that content among their personal networks.</p> \n <p>Making this process simple is critical to your content spreading.&nbsp;I mean, have you every tried to Tweet an article that didn't have a <em>Tweet</em> button?</p> \n <p>It's a total pain: 1) copy a URL, 2) open another tab, 3) go to a link shortener, 4) paste that link, 5) click the shorten button, 6) copy that link, 7) go to their Twitter account, 8) paste that link in there, 9) look up the Twitter handle of the publisher, 10) and then add custom copy for the tweet.</p> \n <p>I'm exhausted just typing it out. So, make life easier on your audience and, in return, <em>they'll</em> do a lot of your content marketing for you.</p> \n <p>Finally, make sure you're making content subscription easy. For example, your blog should have a <a href=\"https://knowledge.hubspot.com/ctas/create-calls-to-action-ctas\">customized CTA</a> so people can choose to \"Subscribe\" and receive email alerts when you publish new content.</p> \n <p>What better way to drive email traffic to your content without lifting a finger (except for the finger you use to press \"Publish\", of course) than growing a giant base of followers and subscribers?</p> \n <h4><strong>6) Don't forget about search engine optimization (SEO).</strong></h4> \n <p>Every time you publish a blog post, you create a new page on your site that's being indexed in the <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/serp\">search engine results page (SERP)</a>. At that point, <em>Google </em>is marketing content for you. For free. Forever.</p> \n <p>If you pay attention to <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/blog-search-engine-optimization\">SEO</a>,&nbsp;hone in on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-rank-hubspot-seo-strategist\">keyword research</a>, and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/blog-seo-modern-marketer-optimize-your-posts-ht\">optimize your content</a>, and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/historical-blog-seo-conversion-optimization\">update your current content</a>, it'll surface more frequently SERPs and you'll drastically improve your traffic, conversions, brand awareness, and more.</p> \n <p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Editor's note: This post was originally published in December, 2012 and has been updated for comprehensiveness.</span></p> \n <span style=\"font-style: italic;\"> </span>\n <span class=\"hs-cta-wrapper\"> <span class=\"hs-cta-node hs-cta-bdc85ae5-d952-41ee-9cf4-8ff3ec62723e\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">  </span><a href=\"http://cta-redirect.hubspot.com/cta/redirect/53/bdc85ae5-d952-41ee-9cf4-8ff3ec62723e\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/bdc85ae5-d952-41ee-9cf4-8ff3ec62723e.png\"></a> </span>  </span>    \n <span class=\"hs-cta-wrapper\"> <span class=\"hs-cta-node hs-cta-2891588d-22d3-4b0b-8db4-27a7a57f6c45\"> <a href=\"http://cta-redirect.hubspot.com/cta/redirect/249/2891588d-22d3-4b0b-8db4-27a7a57f6c45\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/249/2891588d-22d3-4b0b-8db4-27a7a57f6c45.png\"></a> </span>  </span>\n</div>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fblog%2Ftabid%2F6307%2Fbid%2F33906%2F6-tips-for-creating-content-that-spreads-naturally.aspx&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 28 Jul 2020 11:45:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/create%20content%20that%20spreads%20naturally.jpg#keepProtocol","linkMd5":"0b4d82e129cbe5a10a7c50dd908cc3ba","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn41@2020_6/2020-07-30/1596118303675_139d47f56ceb8772.webp","metaImg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/create%20content%20that%20spreads%20naturally.jpg#keepProtocol","author":"Janet Aronica","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Content%20Spread-1.png?width=1500&name=Content%20Spread-1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn65@2020_4/2020-07-30/1596118311399_bb40dda5cae0a9cf.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202020-04-20%20at%204.31.14%20PM.png?width=1500&name=Screen%20Shot%202020-04-20%20at%204.31.14%20PM.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn50@2020_6/2020-07-30/1596118310377_11ac57bd2b7faf8c.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/bdc85ae5-d952-41ee-9cf4-8ff3ec62723e.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn13@2020_6/2020-07-30/1596118307080_a7610b2e2c9ab35b.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/249/2891588d-22d3-4b0b-8db4-27a7a57f6c45.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn41@2020_4/2020-07-30/1596118308641_2caecb78af1abfb0.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fblog%2Ftabid%2F6307%2Fbid%2F33906%2F6-tips-for-creating-content-that-spreads-naturally.aspx&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn53@2020_1/2020-07-30/1596118305952_c772dae6d69c28ff.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-07-30 22:11:40","updatedTime":"2020-07-30 14:11:40","title":"Working Remotely?

Learned","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/co-marketing-campaign","description":"<p>Co-marketing campaigns can be undeniably effective for increasing brand awareness, reaching new audiences, or creating amazing — and potentially delicious — new products.</p>  \n<p>For instance, consider the partnership between Doritos and Taco Bell, which resulted in <a href=\"https://www.tacobell.com/food/tacos/nacho-cheese-doritos-locos-tacos\">Doritos Locos Tacos</a>, a delicious product promoted in a brilliant co-marketing campaign. If you haven't heard of the partnership, watch the story unfold in this promotional video:</p> \n<div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"width: 100%; height: auto; position: relative; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; max-width: 560px; max-height: 315px; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\"> \n <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 0;\">\n  <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/q3Q4DwKsUuI\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n </div> \n</div> \n<p>In this case, the two B2C companies saw success in their venture — and now, the popular item is a mainstay on the Taco Bell menu. Marketers at the two companies can attribute the home-run to a certain tactic: co-marketing.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>A wonderful way for two companies to partner together, co-marketing can create opportunities for businesses to reach new audiences and delight existing audiences at the same time.</p> \n<p>For instance, HubSpot has the Partner program, which offers unique benefits, including co-marketing opportunities. Recently, the team decided to run a few tests to see if co-marketing could expand past content offers — and what that would look like.</p> \n<p>Essentially, the team aimed to answer three questions:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>How do we move co-marketing programming forward?</li> \n <li>How do we keep providing top-notch education?</li> \n <li>How do we keep our lead number high while creating value for our audience?</li> \n</ul> \n<p>HubSpot Academy gives educational value to its audiences, so it was a great channel for partners to get involved. It's the home of hundreds of <a href=\"https://www.g2.com/products/hubspot-academy/reviews\">world-leading</a> courses about marketing and sales. Lessons even include tools to help viewers take actionable steps as they learn.</p> \n<p><em>\"Maybe, to expand co-marketing opportunities,\"</em> the team hypothesized, <em>\"We could have partners upload their own lessons within courses and certification tracks. They can demo how their tools work with the current lesson in practice.\"</em></p> \n<p>This could mean more traffic from audiences with interests that align closely with partners' target audiences.</p> \n<p>Having settled on the experiment, HubSpot's team then needed to stop and think through possible speed bumps. For starters, will partners be able to drive leads with Academy? Will HubSpot audiences even be interested in offers?</p> \n<p>Here, let's explore how HubSpot's Academy team created and ran a co-marketing campaign, and lessons they learned that you can apply to your own co-marketing efforts.</p> \n<h2>HubSpot's Co-marketing Campaign</h2> \n<p>To start, Moz hosted a video lesson for HubSpot Academy's Content Marketing Course.</p> \n<p>\"<a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?ei=4L8QX9ihJaawytMP25OayA4&amp;q=hubspot+creating+topic+clusters+and+pillar+pages&amp;oq=hubspot+creating+topic+clusters+and+pillar+pages&amp;gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzIFCCEQoAE6BAgAEEc6BAgAEEM6BQgAELEDOgIIADoHCAAQsQMQQzoICAAQsQMQkQI6BQgAEJECOgYIABAWEB46BQghEKsCOggIIRAWEB0QHjoHCCEQChCgAVCNgRZYlqwWYNSsFmgAcAV4AIABvgGIAbggkgEEMzguOZgBAKABAaoBB2d3cy13aXo&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjYkcSe1dLqAhUmmHIEHduJBukQ4dUDCAw&amp;uact=5\">Creating Topic Clusters and Pillar Pages</a>\" was a demo for <a href=\"https://moz.com/explorer\">Moz's free Keyword Explorer tool</a>.</p> \n<p>Users can leverage the lesson's content for keyword research, making finding value blog topics easy and organized.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/HubSpot%20Ran%20A%20Co-marketing%20Campaign%20Heres%20What%20We%20Learned.png\" alt=\"Moz's lesson on creating topic clusters.\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n</div> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'times new roman', times;\"><a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?ei=4L8QX9ihJaawytMP25OayA4&amp;q=hubspot+creating+topic+clusters+and+pillar+pages&amp;oq=hubspot+creating+topic+clusters+and+pillar+pages&amp;gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzIFCCEQoAE6BAgAEEc6BAgAEEM6BQgAELEDOgIIADoHCAAQsQMQQzoICAAQsQMQkQI6BQgAEJECOgYIABAWEB46BQghEKsCOggIIRAWEB0QHjoHCCEQChCgAVCNgRZYlqwWYNSsFmgAcAV4AIABvgGIAbggkgEEMzguOZgBAKABAaoBB2d3cy13aXo&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjYkcSe1dLqAhUmmHIEHduJBukQ4dUDCAw&amp;uact=5\">Image Source</a></span></p> \n<p>\"Folks go through this course and see a video saying, <em>'Hey, you can use this tool for free to do exactly what this course is teaching you,'</em>\" Margot Mazur, Senior Co-marketing Manager, told me.</p> \n<p>It worked.</p> \n<p>Results positively supported the questions HubSpot's team asked. In four months, the video earned 8,000 lesson views, and 6,000 clicks to Moz. In total, Moz earned 1,460 new contacts.</p> \n<p>Similar experiments also brought favorable results. After reaching out, partners could host a lesson, demo a relevant resource, and share a CTA with a direct link.</p> \n<p>From this successful campaign, the co-marketing team guessed that the tactic could be beneficial in other areas of HubSpot.</p> \n<p>For instance, the team considered trying the same experiment during <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/adapt2020?_ga=2.245523268.1927936983.1595381564-940436819.1565181751\">Adapt 2020</a>, a series of webinars that help audiences adapt to different business challenges.</p> \n<p>\"I reached out to partners to see if they wanted to lead weekly webinars,\" recalls Mazur. \"The experience for that has been really good — it's positive for both parties.\"</p> \n<p>Webinars, similar to the lessons on Academy, were released for Adapt. This one featured Sally Woellner, Template Design Lead, talking about creating brand kits using <a href=\"https://www.canva.com/\">Canva</a>:</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Canva%20BK%20with%20HS.png?width=1015&amp;name=Canva%20BK%20with%20HS.png\" width=\"1015\" style=\"width: 1015px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" alt=\"Adapt 2020 lesson on website design with Canva and HubSpot.\">\n</div> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'times new roman', times;\"><a href=\"https://community.hubspot.com/t5/CMS-Development/Designing-a-Website-That-Works-For-You-Canva-HubSpot-Webinar/m-p/348358?_ga=2.17473273.1173791517.1594654110-940436819.1565181751#M17144\">Image Source</a></span></p> \n<p>The webinar also explained how to use themes in HubSpot, the importance of website design and helpful design tools including Canva.</p> \n<p>Another expansion of co-marketing opportunities comes from the HubSpot Blogs. Mazur thought blog posts could be an excellent way to add more value to partners and readers.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/HubSpot%20Ran%20A%20Co-marketing%20Campaign%20Heres%20What%20We%20Learned-1.png\" alt=\"Example of co-marketing on.a blog.\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n</div> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'times new roman', times;\"><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/sales-email-templates-examples?_ga=2.18039929.1927936983.1595381564-940436819.1565181751\">Image Source</a></span></p> \n<p>Posts like the one above display how partners can leverage HubSpot's Blogs for guest posts. These posts tackled topics that interest audiences of both parties, and ultimately result in driving leads for partners <em>and</em> providing value for HubSpot readers.</p> \n<p>At this point, the co-marketing team identified four tactics for improving partner involvement: Academy education courses, blogs, quarterly campaigns (Such as Adapt), and content offers.</p> \n<p>So, what did the co-marketing team take away from this experiment? Let's dive into four lessons they learned, next.</p> \n<h3>1. Co-marketing can expand — and should.</h3> \n<p>The purpose of HubSpot's experiment was to find effective co-marketing opportunities across a range of teams and on various company platforms. The results demonstrate how co-marketing can be a strategy used company-wide to reach business goals.</p> \n<p>With the inclusion of blogs, video, and content offers, partnerships can be leveraged to provide value for both parties. To try a similar tactic, you might consider running a co-marketing campaign for a team you normally wouldn't.</p> \n<p>For instance, maybe your company produces webinars and blog content. Those are channels that can benefit from a guest lesson or post about something that's relevant to the industry.</p> \n<h3>2. Videos perform better than ebooks for partner content.</h3> \n<p>About two years ago, one of the highest-performing co-marketing avenues was an ebook offer.</p> \n<p>Now, however, Mazur and her team have found that videos perform better than ebooks when it comes to partner content.</p> \n<p>Take the Academy lessons and webinars, for instance. Results from those two tactics have proven more successful, averaging a thousand more submissions than ebooks. In a world where social audiences often <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/state-of-marketing?__hstc=20629287.baf2406400c73bbe46641b2b9cd8a38f.1563824949326.1584540014200.1584545281370.484&amp;__hssc=20629287.18.1584545281370&amp;__hsfp=3755920611&amp;_ga=2.18039929.1927936983.1595381564-940436819.1565181751\">prefer video to text</a>, adapting to this shift has served the team well.</p> \n<h3>3. Driving partner leads through new channels is difficult.</h3> \n<p>Even though the experiment saw success, it wasn't without some low moments. \"Driving leads for partners is difficult, and we have to continue to work to make that easier for partners,\" notes Mazur.</p> \n<p>She says low performance could be a result of account sign-ups being confused with partner sign-ups. Now that there's proof it's possible, one of the next steps in this process is to make sure partners have a way to earn more leads.</p> \n<h3>4. Partners find value in product sign-ups from other channels.</h3> \n<p>Even though leads weren't record-breaking from the first experiment, partners found value in those Academy signups. The excellent performance is because of the types of partners and content chosen.</p> \n<p>Mazur's team was tasked with finding the right partners to host lessons for Academy. The lessons had to make sense, be actionable, reputable, and a natural fit into the larger, existing course.</p> \n<p>To illustrate, one of the courses on Academy is \"<a href=\"https://academy.hubspot.com/lessons/improving-website-performance?library=true&amp;_ga=2.82454358.1927936983.1595381564-940436819.1565181751\">The Importance of Website Performance</a>.\" One of the lessons, \"Using Heatmaps to Optimize Performance,\" is led by a Customer Experience professional at Hotjar. In the lesson, we see a tutorial about how to use Hotjar's heatmaps to analyze web page engagement.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/HubSpot%20Ran%20A%20Co-marketing%20Campaign%20Heres%20What%20We%20Learned-3.png\" alt=\"Hotjar's lesson on using heatmaps to analyze web performance.\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n</div> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'times new roman', times;\"><a href=\"https://app.hubspot.com/academy/53/lessons/707/3606?_ga=2.82454358.1927936983.1595381564-940436819.1565181751\">Image Source</a></span></p> \n<p>A lesson about using a helpful tool to analyze website performance in this course — great fit, right? Now, imagine if the Hotjar lesson was inserted into a Social Media Certification course — not as helpful.</p> \n<p>Because the subjects fit, the audiences watching the course will most likely find content from both partners equally useful — which, ultimately, results in higher-quality leads.</p> \n<p>Now that the Academy strategy has proven successful, Mazur's team wants to keep it going.

While I'd still go to my office for in-person meetings during the first few days of the week, I'd usually work remotely on Thursdays and Fridays to avoid noise or interruptions while focusing on heads-down projects. These turned out to be some of my most productive days of the week.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>But now, as more workplaces are going partially or fully remote, employees like me are finding themselves working with family or roommates nearby for the first time. At this point, this change of environment has become a surprising and unique challenge for even the most experienced remote employees.</p> \n<p>Even when you get along with family or roommates, putting your professional needs before personal life needs during work hours can feel uncomfortable or tense.</p> \n<p>Aside from dealing with this new sense of discomfort, your workday also changes in a number of logistical ways. For example, the house might get louder during the day, planning uninterrupted video calls might feel strenuous, you might have to share your precious workspace, and some roommates or family members might have trouble adapting to remote work boundaries.</p> \n<p>In fact, no matter how well you plan out your daily household routine, there's always room for unexpected mishaps.</p> \n<p>Remember the viral video where a CNN correspondent's children strutted into their father's video interview? If not, here it is:</p> \n<div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"width: 100%; height: auto; position: relative; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; max-width: 560px; max-height: 315px; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\"> \n <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 0;\">\n  <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/IKxqy9SJ-0I\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n </div> \n</div> \n<p>While the man in the video might have felt horrified at the time, many people who've been in similar situations actually found the incident to be adorable and relatable.</p> \n<p>In 2020, a lot of us are thinking about <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKxqy9SJ-0I\">the CNN contributor's video call</a>&nbsp;as we navigate working remotely with family or roommates.</p> \n<p>To help you navigate a shared remote work experience, here's a list of tips from HubSpot employees who've mastered working from home with loved ones or roommates in close proximity.</p> \n<h2>How to Work Remotely With Roommates or Family</h2> \n<h3>1. Give roommates or working family members as much space as you can.</h3> \n<p>Remember, you should <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/books-make-you-more-empathetic?_ga=2.140242931.1749610492.1595602855-631527517.1595282187\">always have empathy</a>&nbsp;and respect for your roommates or loved ones and their personal space. That doesn't stop when you all have to work from home together. In this situation, you should start to think of your roommates and adult family members like co-workers.</p> \n<p>Rather than sitting right next to a roommate, distracting them, or doing something loudly as you would after work hours, create an environment that allows everyone to work well at the same time.</p> \n<p>If you have a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/remote-workspace?_ga=2.140242931.1749610492.1595602855-631527517.1595282187\">desk in your room or your own office space already set up</a>, try to work there as much as possible to prevent encroaching on the <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/remote-workspace\">workspace</a>&nbsp;of roommates that don't have the same space in their room. If no one has a desk or a room they can work in, have each roommate designate where they'll be working each day so that everyone is at a proper distance. You might also want to consider days where you'll relocate to new workspaces in case anyone needs a change of scenery.</p> \n<h3>2. Communicate about your schedules and expectations.</h3> \n<p>Almost all the colleagues that I spoke to explained that communication is key when working remotely with roommates and family.</p> \n<p>With strong communication, you can prevent someone from accidentally walking into the background of your meeting, two video calls happening in one room or other at-home issues that can impact your workday.</p> \n<p>\"Before each workday, have a conversation on what your roommates, partners, or family members schedule that day is going to look like. This way, you'll have a good sense of when their day starts, ends, and when they will be taking a break so you can plan accordingly,\" says Jennifer Stefancik, a marketing manager on our HubSpot Academy team.</p> \n<p>If you have children at home, you can also use a morning conversation to talk with adult family members or partners to determine who'll be watching them at different points of the day, helping them with schoolwork, or making them lunch while other family members are in meetings or tuned into work.</p> \n<p>While you're discussing schedules with family members or colleagues, you should also discuss your expectations and professional boundaries.</p> \n<p>\"If you don’t communicate your expectations for behavior during your meetings, they won’t know how to behave,\" says Rebecca White, a junior staff writer for the HubSpot Blog. \"For example, you can say something like ‘I have meetings from 8 a.m. to 9 a.m. and 10 a.m. to 11 a.m. tomorrow. During these meetings, please no cooking or TV. You can walk around, but no talking or sound. I’ll let you know when the meeting is over!’\"</p> \n<h3>3. Avoid interrupting roommate or family-member meetings at all costs.</h3> \n<p>Think of your roommate or adult family member like a coworker. Would you barge into a colleague's meeting to ask them a quick question? Would you walk into a meeting room when the door is closed and people are talking inside? I really hope not!</p> \n<p>\"To avoid interrupting (or potential embarrassment), always assume your roommate, partner, or family member is in a meeting before talking or making loud sounds. You can communicate with them via text or Slack. Or, my personal favorite has been waving my arms in the air to get their attention!) to check and see if they are on a call,\" says Stefancik.</p> \n<p>As Stefancik mentions, there are many ways to communicate with roommates aside from knocking on the door, yelling their name, or walking up and talking to them. For example, use Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, or text messages to ask a roommate a question. Or, if it can wait, write it down in your phone's Notes and plan to ask the question later.</p> \n<p>Additionally, if your roommate or loved one is working in a common space, like a dining room or a kitchen, be quiet and remain out of the camera's view if you must enter the room.</p> \n<p>On the other hand, if you're the roommate who's been forced to work in the kitchen or living room, you should also set boundaries to ensure your housemates don't cause any interruptions.</p> \n<p>If you're stuck working in a common space, you might also want to consider setting designated times where roommates can walk freely into common areas, cook, eat, or watch TV each day. However, try to be somewhat flexible. Your roommates are still human and might need to cook an early dinner, grab a quick snack, or watch a show to relax after they finish work.</p> \n<h3>4. Know when to make compromises.</h3> \n<p>Yes, your housemates should respect your space and try to avoid interrupting you at all costs. But, at the same time, you'll want to make sure your schedule isn't interrupting them too much.</p> \n<p>For example, if one roommate is sitting at the kitchen table and the rest of the house is empty, find a place to sit where you can do your video calls far away from them rather than taking over their territory or interrupting their day.</p> \n<p>As you approach your workday, remember that your roommate might be making compromises to make you comfortable, so you should also make compromises for them.</p> \n<p>Being <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/digital-body-language\">empathetic</a>&nbsp;to housemates is something Anna Fitzgerald, a HubSpot Blog staff writer, strongly advises.</p> \n<p>\"I’m working in an apartment with three roommates where the Wi-Fi really only works in the living room and kitchen, so we’ve had to practice a lot of empathy,\" says Fitzgerald</p> \n<p>\"One day, my roommate was on a Zoom call in front of our silverware drawer, so I ended up eating my lunch without a fork. The next day when she was on a call, I tripped over my computer charger, catapulting my laptop from a high-top table to the floor with a shockingly loud thump,\" Fitzgerald shares. \"We know we’re doing our best and are quick to forgive as we learn to be coworkers as well as roommates.\"</p> \n<p>To add to the sense of empathy and understanding, be sure to make time to bond with your roommates after you spend the day keeping your distance during work hours.</p> \n<p>\"We try to stay out of each other’s way as much as possible during the day and then eat 'family dinner' together. It’s a great way to make sure we stay productive during the day and disconnect at the end,\" Fitzgerald adds.</p> \n<h3>5. Avoid overlapping meetings or presentations.</h3> \n<p>As mentioned above, communicating with your family and roommates will help you prevent embarrassing moments during meetings or interruptions that could affect your work. Aside from this, you should also communicate to make sure each roommate can participate in, host, or present in meetings successfully during the week. If you don't have multiple rooms in your house, this also means making sure your meetings don't overlap.</p> \n<p>\"We have a small space that isn't easy to soundproof. Early in the week and at the beginning of every day, my husband and I go over our schedule to determine if we have meetings that overlap,\" says Crystal King, a senior marketing manager. \"If one meeting is really important -- like a presentation for a webinar -- we'll shift schedules to accommodate. We've found that our colleagues are all pretty understanding.\"</p> \n<p>Stafancik echoed this statement by advising, \"If you are sharing a working space, look at your schedule and see if you'll be presenting or talking a lot in any meetings. If so, plan ahead to either work in a different space or see if your 'coworker' can move to another space during that time.\"</p> \n<h3>6. Create a realistic daily routine.</h3> \n<p>When you're working with family or roommates, having a household routine will help keep everyone aligned and allow everything to run smoothly.</p> \n<p>If you have roommates, this routine could include things like cleaning times or roommate bonding times that prevent apartment messes or socialization from cutting into your work hours.</p> \n<p>If you're working with family or have children at home, a family routine can be even more important. For example, this routine could determine activities that your children will do while you are occupied in a meeting, or which parent will watch a child during different times of the day.</p> \n<p>According to Nataly Kelly, HubSpot's VP of Localization, \"Kids thrive on routine. We all know this, but it's hard to not have a schedule for them when you yourself are working on the clock and have scheduled meetings.\"</p> \n<p>While a routine can be an important guideline for each day, Kelly adds that it's important to remain flexible if your daily plan goes off track.</p> \n<p>\"I believe a routine is great. But, don't stress too much about sticking to a strict schedule with children, because they might not always want to move along.\" Kelly shares.</p> \n<p>To help her children stay on a schedule, and avoid interrupting her own work, Kelly provides them with visual signals to show that she's focusing on work or in a meeting.</p> \n<p>\"I set up a timer in each major area of my house so that my kids can see the clock counting down without having to ask me how much time is left on my work calls,\" Kelly explains. \"Then, when the timer goes off (one minute after the end of my meetings), they know it's time to change to their next daily activity.\"</p> \n<p>\"This doesn't always work. My kids are like everyone else's and don't always listen,\" Kelly notes. \"But, it helps.\"</p> \n<h3>7. Don't forget to bond with your roommates or loved ones.</h3> \n<p>Colleagues that work well together often take time for team bonding and non-work related activities. So, why shouldn't you practice the same tactics with the roommates or family members you live with?</p> \n<p>Being sure to tune out at the end of the day, planning activities with roommates, or spending time with family after you've clocked out will further help you communicate with them, work better alongside them, and maintain your work-life balance.</p> \n<p>\"It's important to carve out mental separations between work and family time,\" says Sherry Ng, a senior marketing manager. \"I recommend always scheduling time to decompress after work so that you don't jump right into time with family and friends while still thinking about emails or projects. It allows you to be more present with those you love.\"</p> \n<h2>Embracing Your \"New Coworkers\"</h2> \n<p>Working in the same house with roommates or family can be a major challenge, especially if you've never worked in this type of environment before. As you continue to navigate this work style, keep these overarching tips in common.</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Be empathic: Remember, although you might be compromising to help your roommates, they might be compromising for you. Be sure to think about what you're going through, their needs, and how you can both work well together.</li> \n <li>Set boundaries: Although you should be empathetic and respectful to your roommates or family members, it's important to set boundaries such as when you need silence for meetings, how your roommates should behave to avoid disruption or your personal space needs.</li> \n <li>Maintain work-life balance: Even though you should think of your roommates like coworkers during the day, keep things casual like usual during the nights and weekends. This helps to prevent work from sucking the fun out of your family or roommate relationships and also leaves you time to pleasantly bond with them.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>To learn more about successfully working from home, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/remote-work-tips?_ga=2.140242931.1749610492.1595602855-631527517.1595282187\">check out these tips from some of our remote staff</a>.

Then, once you finally figure that out, you have to determine how much traffic you need to hit that goal ... but you're not sure what approach to take there, either.</p> \n<p>Sounds like you could use hand calculating your leads and traffic goals. Luckily, <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/inbound-marketing-calculator\">there's an Excel template for that</a>. Rather than try to sort of these numbers on your own, this template is designed to take care of the math and leave you with a clear picture of what you need to accomplish in order to achieve your traffic and leads goals <em>and</em> ensure the health of your inbound marketing strategy.</p> \n<h3>10. <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/monthly-marketing-reporting-template\">Your Monthly Marketing Metrics</a></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/00-Blog-Related_Images/Monthly_Marketing_Metrics_Excel.png?width=669&amp;name=Monthly_Marketing_Metrics_Excel.png\" alt=\"monthly marketing metrics template in excel that includes rows for direct traffic, email marketing, and other channels to calculate month over month growth\" title=\"Monthly_Marketing_Metrics_Excel.png\" width=\"669\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<p>Is there a feeling sweeter than hitting all of your goals for the month? How about communicating your success to your boss? Excel spreadsheets can be used to prepare comprehensive reports of your <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/34054/The-6-Marketing-Metrics-Your-CEO-Actually-Cares-About-Cheat-Sheet.aspx\">marketing metrics</a> to send off to your boss -- and there's no need to work from scratch. (After all, you've already so worked hard this month.)</p> \n<p>To simplify your reporting, <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/monthly-marketing-reporting-template\">check out these monthly marketing metrics templates</a> (and the corresponding PowerPoint template). Each, month, you can update them quickly and easily to reflect your monthly visits, leads, customers, and conversion rates. From there, you'll have everything you need to accurately track and report on which channels are performing best. Every boss loves to see ROI, so you can't go wrong with these templates.</p> \n<h3>11. <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/monthly-marketing-reporting-template-1\">Essential KPI Tracker</a></h3> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/essential-kpi-tracking-template.jpg?width=690&amp;name=essential-kpi-tracking-template.jpg\" alt=\"essential kpi tracker template in excel that tracks measurement frequency and grades performance by green, yellow, and red\" width=\"690\" style=\"width: 690px;\"></p> \n<p>If you're a fan of the monthly metrics template -- item #10 on this list -- you might want to grab a copy of this template as well. The essential KPI tracker, shown above, takes the metrics your marketing team has agreed to track and describes them in more detail.</p> \n<p>KPI stands for \"key performance indicator\" -- they're basically your <em>most important</em> metrics, each with a unique purpose and place in your marketing strategy. Using this template, you can assign specific employees to each KPI, define the frequency at which you'll monitor each KPI's performance, and assign each KPI a color that reflects the quality of that KPI's performance.</p> \n<p>If one of your KPIs is organic traffic, for example, you can set up your template such that 100 page views per month is red (poor performance), 500 page views/month is yellow (stable performance), and 1000 page views/month is green (great performance).</p> \n<p>Data is any marketer's friend, and even though spreadsheets seem like they've been around forever, Microsoft Excel has so many capabilities that still make it an amazing resource for displaying, organizing, analyzing, and parsing data. With a little bit of Excel magic, you can streamline your workflow and/or arrive at some a-ha moments from data insights.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p> \n<p><em>Editor's note: This post was originally published in March 2019 and has been updated for comprehensiveness.</em></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fmarketing-with-excel-templates-list&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important;

So, how do you do that? And how do you know when your communication needs some work?</p> \n<p>Below, let's review some signs that your remote team isn't communicating as effectively as possible.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h3>1. Your team has too many meetings.</h3> \n<p>As a remote worker, I know I've had days where I jump from meeting to meeting with no time for a break. Sometimes, this can actually be a symptom of poor communication.</p> \n<p>Typically, your team shouldn't have to meet several times a week. In fact, plenty of meetings can be sent in an email.</p> \n<p>Before scheduling a meeting, think about whether that meeting will waste time. If you aren't sure, then reevaluate whether the content can be sent in an email.</p> \n<p>Additionally, keep in mind when you schedule a meeting that every person you invited needs to be there. If not, let them know it's optional. Plus, think about the length of your meetings. If it can be shorter, make it shorter.</p> \n<p>Regardless, it's important to be intentional when you're planning remote meetings.</p> \n<h3>2. You've never thought about digital body language.</h3> \n<p>When you're communicating via video conferencing, it can be easy to forget about digital body language.</p> \n<p>However, it's important to keep in mind that nothing on camera is subtle and it can feel like you have a spotlight on you.</p> \n<p>That means you have to pay even more attention to body language.</p> \n<p>For instance, you should still maintain eye contact, speak clearly, and have your video on during remote calls.</p> \n<h3>3. Team members don't contribute during online team meetings.</h3> \n<p>Have you ever been to a meeting where the same people speak up and other team members don't?</p> \n<p>This can be a symptom of poor communication on your team because it might mean that some team members don't feel comfortable talking during meetings.</p> \n<p>On the other hand, it's important to keep in mind that some people are more introverted than others.</p> \n<p>To ensure that all team members are contributing, consider asking everyone a question and going round-robin so everyone has a chance to speak.</p> \n<h3>4. Your team isn't collaborating.</h3> \n<p>Do you collaborate with your team when the opportunity arises? As a manager, do you notice that your team isn't collaborating?</p> \n<p>If collaboration isn't happening, this could be a sign that team members don't feel comfortable reaching out to each other.</p> \n<p>Additionally, this could mean that your team doesn't have the tools they need to collaborate effectively.</p> \n<p>For example, on the HubSpot blog team, we use Trello to keep track of our editorial assignments. With this tool, writers can easily collaborate with other team members when they want to lean on them for expertise.</p> \n<h3>5. There's no communication throughout the day.</h3> \n<p>In previous remote roles, I was able to go days without talking to another coworker. While the introverted part of my personality loved that, it was a sign that our team wasn't communicating well.</p> \n<p>The more you talk to people on your team, the more trust you'll have. This makes it easier to reach out when you need help. That's why it's important to make sure your team feels comfortable communicating throughout the day -- even if it's just to send a GIF to the group chat.</p> \n<p>While you don't want to inundate your team with messages, checking in every so often is important for camaraderie and team communication.</p> \n<h3>6. Emails are overly complicated.</h3> \n<p>Emails should always be simple, clear, and specific. If you're writing an email and it's overly complicated, you might want to schedule a quick Zoom meeting with that person.</p> \n<p>To communicate effectively, it's important to know what channel to use to deliver your message. Sometimes it works in an email, but sometimes it requires a meeting.</p> \n<h3>7. There's no agenda or meeting structure.</h3> \n<p>If you don't have an agenda or meeting structure, you might not be communicating effectively during your meetings.</p> \n<p>Meetings should be organized and structured so they're productive. Having an agenda will keep you on track.</p> \n<p>You might even want to schedule in the five minutes of informal chat before a meeting gets started. This will help team members self-regulate.</p> \n<p>If it's possible, you should always send the agenda prior to the meeting.</p> \n<p>However, this isn't necessary with regularly scheduled meetings. For those, just make sure you've set expectations.</p> \n<h3>8. Your team doesn't use \"Working With Me\" documents.</h3> \n<p>Every member on your team should have a \"Working With Me\" document that details work habits, expectations, and even interests.</p> \n<p>These documents are helpful for managers to learn about their team so they can properly manage communication among various team members.</p> \n<p>Additionally, you can also share these with everyone on the team so coworkers can get to know their teammates better.</p> \n<p>Knowing each other's work habits will help build trust and psychological safety on your team.</p> \n<p>Instead of spending time trying to figure people out, your team can just talk about it.</p> \n<h3>9. Norms for communication haven't been established.</h3> \n<p>If you've ever been stressed about communicating with your remote team, that's probably because norms for communication haven't been established.</p> \n<p>For example, everyone's work hours and breaks should be clear. This could mean that everyone is on the same Google calendar or they've added a status on their Slack so people know that they aren't available.</p> \n<p>Whatever your team's method is, make sure that's communicated among everyone.</p> \n<p>Additionally, it might be wise to set expectations in your emails. When you send an email that doesn't need a response, you might want to call that out.</p> \n<p>Setting expectations and norms will help improve communication immensely.</p> \n<h3>10. Your team hasn't built psychological safety.</h3> \n<p>If there's no psychological safety on your team, then you aren't communicating effectively.</p> \n<p>On remote teams, sometimes it can be hard to feel included. However, the option to be included is so important.</p> \n<p>When people don't feel included, they won't feel comfortable speaking up.</p> \n<p>To build psychological safety in a remote meeting, make sure you go round-robin so everyone has a chance to speak.</p> \n<p>Additionally, try to focus on bigger picture conversations and ask people specific questions.</p> \n<p>Plus, you can do a \"This or That\" activity. Doing a quick icebreaker where everyone has to go around and answer a question can help people feel confident about communicating with the team.</p> \n<h3>11. Your team doesn't express appreciation for one another.</h3> \n<p>Forming connections is paramount for communication.</p> \n<p>One of the best ways to do this is to express gratitude for each other. For example, people should feel free to congratulate each other in a group chat.</p> \n<p>Additionally, you can send birthday cards or just create an email thread of appreciation.</p> \n<p>Expressing gratitude is a great way to renew your energy and create a safe space on your team.</p> \n<h3>12. Managers redo work from team members.</h3> \n<p>If you're a manager and you've found yourself redoing work from your team, that means you aren't communicating effectively.</p> \n<p>When assignments are sent back with errors, typically this means that the assignment wasn't clear and expectations weren't communicated.</p> \n<p>If you ever redo someone's work, that shows that you might not feel comfortable sending edits.</p> \n<p>Again, the problem here is all about communication. The only way to improve this process is to … you guessed it, communicate with each other.</p> \n<h3>13. Assignments fall through the cracks.</h3> \n<p>Have you ever had an assignment just fall through the cracks? Or perhaps you're unsure where you left off on a project.</p> \n<p>When this happens, it's clear that you aren't using a great project management tool that enables communication.</p> \n<p>With project management tools, you should be able to see what stage a project is on and collaborate with others right in the tool. By improving communication, assignments won't fall through the cracks.</p> \n<h3>14. Your team has a high turnover rate.</h3> \n<p>If your team has a high turnover rate, that could mean that your communication isn't effective. When this happens, it's important to talk to your team so you can figure out what's working and what isn't.</p> \n<p>While working remotely can make communication feel harder, it doesn't have to be that way. If your team is communicating ineffectively, you can use these <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/remote-productivity\">productivity tips</a> to help.</p> \n<p><em>Editor's note: This post was originally published in May, 2020 and has been updated for comprehensiveness.</em></p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fremote-miscommunication&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 22 Jul 2020 12:15:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/remote-miscommunication-1.jpg#keepProtocol","linkMd5":"e9841b55a3ffb0dd0d24b6e4a6f82098","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn13@2020_3/2020-07-30/1596118303820_cfb7b852ea6de01f.webp","metaImg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/remote-miscommunication-1.jpg#keepProtocol","author":"Rebecca Riserbato","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fremote-miscommunication&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn41@2020_1/2020-07-30/1596118312709_635a255abbf11144.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-07-30 22:11:40","updatedTime":"2020-07-30 14:11:40","title":"How to Create an Ebook From Start to Finish [Free Ebook Templates]","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-create-an-ebook-free-templates","description":"<p>At age 11, I dreamed of being an editor at a major magazine.

And week after week, I have the satisfaction of being an ebook creator.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h2>What Is an Ebook?</h2> \n<p>Ebook is short for \"electronic book,\" and uses either a computer, mobile device, or ebook reader to display long-form texts in book form. Ebooks have multiple digital \"pages\" that people can navigate through, and are often packaged as a PDF document so they can easily be sent from one user to another.</p> \n<h3>What Are the Benefits of an Ebook?</h3> \n<p>Let's say you have an amazing blog full of long-form content. Why in the world would you want to offer your readers an ebook? Is it even worth your time?</p> \n<p>Here's some advantages ebooks offer content creators:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Unlike long-form printed media, an ebook is immediately accessible.</li> \n <li>You can put it behind an opt-in of some kind, incentivizing your website visitor to become a lead if they want the information.</li> \n <li>In some ways, ebooks have design capabilities you may not be able to achieve on your blog.</li> \n <li>After the initial creation of the ebook, you can distribute the file a multitude of times with no additional production cost. They also have no associated shipping fees.</li> \n <li>You can embed links to other media in the ebook file, encouraging the reader to further engage with your content.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Perhaps more importantly, ebooks offer a number of advantages for your audience:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Ebooks are extremely portable, able to be stored on a number of devices with no physical storage space associated.</li> \n <li>The reader gets the choice to print the ebook out if they want to consume the information in a traditional physical format. Otherwise, the digital format is environmentally friendly.</li> \n <li>Ebooks are accessible with the ability to increase font sizes and/or read aloud with text-to-speech.</li> \n <li>They're also easily searchable if the reader is looking for something specific.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>How Is an Ebook Structured?</h3> \n<p>There's no set rule for organizing your content into an ebook. It generally mimics the structure of a novel or textbook (depending on what it is you're writing about). But, there are some aspects of an ebook you should be sure to adhere to.</p> \n<p>Ebooks have some system of chapters and supporting images. Similar to a blog post, they also do well when further segmenting their text with subheaders that break down the discussion into specific sections. If you're writing about professional sports, for example, and one of your chapters is about Major League Baseball (MLB) in the U.S., you might want to establish subchapters about the various teams belonging to the MLB.</p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>What Can an Ebook Be About?</h3> \n<p>Anything. Well, within reason. Ebooks are simply a marketer's way of delivering lots of critical information in a form their potential customers are most willing to read it. An environmental company might write an ebook all about water conservation. They also might focus an ebook entirely on how their water-saving product is used, or how it helped a customer solve a problem. Discover more ebook ideas at the end of this article.</p> \n<p>No matter what subject your ebook takes on, research is a significant part of ebook creation. Unlike short-form content like articles and videos, the content of an ebook is predicated on trust and evidence. A user who obtains (or requests access to) your ebook wants the full story, not just the bullet points. That includes all the content and testing you went through to produce the ebook.</p> \n<h3>Can You Edit an Ebook?</h3> \n<p>Nope. An ebook can't be edited once it's been saved in one of the file formats described above, so it's best to ensure you have an editable version saved in a program like Microsoft Word.</p> \n<p>But why would you want your ebook to be uneditable? Making ebooks uneditable ensures the content remains unchanged -- both the format and the information -- as it's shared between multiple uses.</p> \n<p>You&nbsp;<em>can</em> edit ebooks if they're saved using an editable PDF, a feature that is specific to Adobe Acrobat -- the founding program of the PDF file type. Learn how to edit PDFs in <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-edit-pdf\">this blog post</a>.</p> \n<h3>How Do You Read an Ebook?</h3> \n<p>You can read an ebook on many different devices: iPhone, Android smartphones, a Macbook, PC, and e-readers such as the Nook and Kindle. The latter two devices are typically used to read novels in digital form. Nook and Kindle owners can store thousands of books (literally) on a single Nook or Kindle.</p> \n<p><strong>But making an ebook can be overwhelming.</strong> Not only do you have to write the content, but you also need to design and format it into a professional-looking document that people will want to download and read. With <a href=\"http://www.emarketer.com/Article/Leads-Take-Hold-Primary-Goal-of-Content-Marketing/1010107\">lead generation being the top goal for content marketing</a>, however, ebooks are an essential part of an successful inbound marketing program.</p> \n<p>In this post, we'll walk you through the ins and outs of creating an ebook by, well, creating an ebook. And if you're worried about your lacking design skills, fret not ...</p> \n<p>Got your free ebook templates? Ready to make an ebook? Great -- let's get to it.</p> \n<h2 style=\"font-weight: bold;\">In What File Formats Can You Save an Ebook?</h2> \n<p>Ebooks can be saved in one of several formats. Depending on your end user, though, you might find a use for any of the following file types:</p> \n<h3>PDF</h3> \n<p>PDFs are likely the most well-known file type. The \"PDF\" extension stands for \"Portable Document Format,\" and is best for ebooks that are meant to be read on a computer (digital marketers, you'll want to remember this one). We'll talk more about how to save your ebook as a PDF later in this article.</p> \n<h3>EPUB</h3> \n<p>This file type stands for \"Electronic Publication,\" and is the more flexible ebook formats. By that, I mean EPUB ebooks can \"reflow\" their text to adapt to various mobile devices and tablets, allowing the ebook's text to move on and off different pages based on the size of the device on which a user is reading the ebook. They're particularly helpful for viewing on <a href=\"https://support.ebooks.com/hc/en-gb/articles/213875366-Guide-to-ebook-formats\">smaller screens</a>, such as smartphones as well as the <a href=\"https://www.barnesandnoble.com/b/nook/_/N-1pbl\">Nook</a> from Barnes and Noble.</p> \n<h3>MOBI</h3> \n<p>The MOBI format originated from the Mobipocket Reader software, which was purchased by Amazon in 2005 but was later shut down in 2016. However, the MOBI file extension remains a popular ebook format with compatibility across the major e-readers (except the Nook).</p> \n<p>While the format comes with some limitations, such as not supporting audio or video, it does support DRM, which protects copyrighted material from being copied for distribution or viewed illegally.</p> \n<p>Newer Kindle formats are based on the original MOBI file types.</p> \n<h3>AZW</h3> \n<p>This is an ebook file type designed for the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-eBooks/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=154606011\">Kindle</a>, an e-reader device by Amazon. However, users can also open this file format on smartphones, tablets, and computers.</p> \n<h3>ODF&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>ODF stands for OpenDocument Format, a file type meant primarily for OpenOffice, a series of open-source content creation programs similar to Microsoft Office.</p> \n<h3>IBA</h3> \n<p>IBA is the proprietary ebook format for the Apple iBooks Author app. This format does support video, sound, images, and interactive elements, but it is only used for books written in iBooks author. It is not compatible with other e-readers.</p> \n<div class=\"hsg-featured-snippet\"> \n <h2>How to Write an Ebook</h2> \n <ol> \n  <li>Choose a topic that matches your audience's needs.</li> \n  <li>Outline each chapter of your ebook.</li> \n  <li>Break down each chapter as you write.</li> \n  <li>Design your ebook.</li> \n  <li>Use the right colors.</li> \n  <li>Incorporate visuals.</li> \n  <li>Highlight quotes or stats.</li> \n  <li>Place appropriate calls-to-action within your ebook.</li> \n  <li>Convert it into a PDF.</li> \n  <li>Create a dedicated landing page for your ebook.</li> \n  <li>Promote your ebook and track its success.</li> \n </ol> \n</div> \n<h3>1. Choose a topic that matches your audience's needs</h3> \n<p>Remember: The goal of your ebook is to <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/lead-generation-introduction\">generate leads for your sales team</a>, so pick a topic that will <strong>make it easy for a prospect to go from downloading your ebook to having a conversation with your sales team</strong>.</p> \n<p>This means your ebook shouldn't deviate much from the topics you cover in your other content marketing channels. Rather, it's your opportunity to do a deep dive into a subject you've only lightly covered until now, but something your audience knows they need to learn more about.</p> \n<p>For example, in listening to sales and customer calls here at HubSpot, I've learned ebooks for use in content marketing is a huge obstacle for our audience, who are marketers themselves. So if I can provide not only this blog post, but resources to make ebook creation easier, I'm focusing on the right topic for opening up a sales conversation.</p> \n<p>To get your creative juices flowing, here are some example ebook titles to consider. (Note: Replace \"x\" with an appropriate number.) You can also use our free <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/blog-topic-generator\">Blog Topic Generator tool</a> to come up with more ideas. Most blog topics can be made comprehensive enough to serve as longer form ebook topics.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>X Best Practices for [Insert Industry/Topic]</strong></li> \n <li><strong>An Introduction to [Insert Industry/Topic]</strong></li> \n <li><strong>X Common Questions About [Insert Industry/Topic] Answered</strong></li> \n <li><strong>X [Insert Industry/Topic] Statistics For Better Decision Making</strong></li> \n <li><strong>Learn From The Best: X [Insert Industry/Topic] Experts Share Insights</strong></li> \n</ul> \n<p>For this blog post, I'm going to use the PowerPoint version of template two from our <strong><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/ebook-templates\">collection of five free ebook templates</a></strong>. Through each section of this post, I'll provide a side-by-side of the template slide and how I customized it.</p> \n<p>Below, you'll see my customized cover with my sales-relevant ebook topic. For help with writing compelling titles for your ebooks, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/a-simple-formula-for-writing-kick-ass-titles-ht\">check out the tips in this blog post</a>.</p> \n<p><img style=\"width: 618px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-363177797-png/Blog-Related_Images/how-to-create-an-ebook-1.png?width=618&amp;height=444&amp;name=how-to-create-an-ebook-1.png\" width=\"618\" height=\"444\" alt=\"an ebook template side-by-side with the customized version of that template\"></p> \n<h3>2. Outline each chapter of your ebook.</h3> \n<p>The introduction to your ebook should both set the stage for the contents of your ebook and draw the reader in. What will you cover in your ebook? How will the reader benefit from reading it? <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-write-introduction-quick-tip-ht\">For tips on how to write an effective introduction, check out this post</a>.</p> \n<p>Some ebook creators say that an ebook is simply a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/repurpose-blog-content-ebook-ht\">series of blog posts stitched together</a>. While I agree you should treat each chapter like an individual blog post, the chapters of your ebook should also flow fluidly from one to the other.</p> \n<p>The best way to outline your ebook is by thinking of it as a crash course on the sales-relevant topic you selected. In my example of creating an ebook, I know I need to cover how to:</p> \n<ol> \n <li>write effective copy</li> \n <li>design an ebook</li> \n <li>optimize ebooks for lead generation and promotion</li> \n</ol> \n<p>While my example has a few chapters, keep in mind that your ebook does <strong>not</strong> need to be lengthy. I have one golden rule for ebook length: <strong>Write what is needed to effectively educate your audience about your selected topic</strong>. If that requires five pages, great! If that requires 30 pages, so be it. Just don't waste words thinking you need to write a long ebook.</p> \n<p>With that, let's move on to the actual copy you're writing.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" style=\"width: 618px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-362689316-png/Blog-Related_Images/how-to-create-an-ebook-2.png?width=616&amp;height=447&amp;name=how-to-create-an-ebook-2.png\" alt=\"an example of ebook copy within an ebook template\" width=\"616\" height=\"447\"></p> \n<h3>3. Break down each chapter as you write.</h3> \n<p>Get writing! Here, you <em>can</em> approach each chapter the way you might write a long blog post -- by compartmentalizing each chapter into smaller sections or bullet points, as shown in the picture below. This helps you write simply and clearly, rather than trying to use sophisticated language to convey each point. It's the most effective way to educate readers and help them understand the new material you’re providing.</p> \n<p>Be sure to maintain a consistent structure across each chapter, as well. This helps you establish natural transitions between each chapter so there's a clear progression from one chapter to the next (simply stiching blog posts together can rob you of this quality).</p> \n<p>These practices should hold true for all your other marketing efforts, such as email marketing, call-to-action creation, and landing page development. “Clarity trumps persuasion,” as Dr. Flint McGlaughlin of MECLABS often likes to say.</p> \n<p>Want to make sure you're keeping your ebook exciting for readers? Here are some key tips to keep in mind:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Use <strong>keywords</strong> in the title that emphasize the value of your offer. Examples include adjectives like “amazing,” “awesome,” or “ultimate.”</li> \n <li>Keep your format <strong>consistent</strong> so you create a mental model for readers and enhance their understanding of the material.</li> \n <li>When appropriate, make use of <strong>formatting</strong> -- like bulleted lists, bold text, italics, and font size changes -- to draw people’s eyes to your most important content or emphasize certain points you want readers to remember.</li> \n</ul> \n<p><img style=\"width: 618px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-361187118-png/Blog-Related_Images/how-to-create-an-ebook-4.png?width=618&amp;height=444&amp;name=how-to-create-an-ebook-4.png\" alt=\"an example of ebook formatting\" width=\"618\" height=\"444\"></p> \n<h3>4. Design your ebook.</h3> \n<p>Our <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/ebook-templates\"><strong>downloadable ebook templates</strong></a> are offered in both PowerPoint and InDesign. For this example, we'll show you how to do it in PowerPoint, since more people have access to that software.</p> \n<p>You'll notice we only have one \"chapter page\" in the template (slide three). To create additional chapter pages, or any pages really, simply right click the slide and choose <strong>Duplicate Slide</strong>. This will make a copy of your slide and allow you to drag it to its proper place in your ebook via the sidebar or Slide Sorter section of PowerPoint. You can then customize it for any subsequent chapters.</p> \n<p><img style=\"width: 618px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-361181293-png/Blog-Related_Images/how-to-create-an-ebook-5.png?width=618&amp;height=444&amp;name=how-to-create-an-ebook-5.png\" alt=\"an example of duplicating ebook pages in a template\" width=\"618\" height=\"444\"></p> \n<h3>5. Use the right colors.</h3> \n<p>Ideally, our <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/ebook-templates\"><strong>free ebook templates</strong></a> would magically match your brand colors. But, they probably don't; this is where you get to truly personalize your work. However, because ebooks offer more real estate for color than your logo or website, it's a good idea to consider secondary colors within your brand's color palate. Ebooks are where this color scheme can truly shine.</p> \n<p>To learn how to add your brand's colors to PowerPoint, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-brand-colors-in-powerpoint-ht\">check out this blog post</a>. That way, you can customize the color scheme in our ebook templates to match your brand!</p> \n<h3>6. Incorporate visuals.</h3> \n<p>Images and graphics in ebooks are hard to get right. The key to making them fit well is to think of them as complementary to your writing. Whether you add them during or after you’ve finished writing your ebook’s copy, your visuals should serve to highlight an important point you’re making or deconstruct the meaning of a concept in an easy-to-understand, visual way.</p> \n<p>Images shouldn’t just be there to make the ebook easy on the eyes. Rather, they should be used to enhance the reader’s understanding of the material you’re covering. If you need help gathering visuals, we have three sets of free stock photos that might help you along the way:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/free-stock-photos\">75 Standard Stock Photos</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/free-stock-photos-business\">160 Business-Themed Stock Photos</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/free-holiday-stock-photos\">250 Holiday Stock Photos</a></li> \n</ul> \n<p>And if you're compiling a data-heavy ebook, you might want to download our <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/data-visualization-guide\">free data visualization ebook</a> for tips about designing compelling charts and graphs for your content.</p> \n<p><img style=\"width: 618px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-360025649-png/Blog-Related_Images/how-to-create-an-ebook-6.png?width=618&amp;name=how-to-create-an-ebook-6.png\" alt=\"an example of using visuals in ebook template\" width=\"618\"></p> \n<h3>7. Highlight quotes or stats.</h3> \n<p>Another way to enhance your ebook is by highlighting quotes or stats within your design. Just be sure the quote or stat you're using genuinely adds value to the content.</p> \n<p>Whether you're emphasizing a quote or adding a visual, keep all your content within the same margins. If your copy is consistently 1-inch indented on your page from both the left and right side, keep your designed elements aligned using that same spacing.</p> \n<p><img style=\"width: 618px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"how-to-create-an-ebook-6-1\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-363858177-png/how-to-create-an-ebook-7.png?width=618&amp;height=444&amp;name=how-to-create-an-ebook-7.png\" alt=\"an example of a highlighted quote on an ebook template\" width=\"618\" height=\"444\"></p> \n<h3>8. Place appropriate calls-to-action within your ebook.</h3> \n<p>Now that your content is written and designed, it's time to optimize it for lead generation, reconversion, and promotion.</p> \n<p>Think about how you got here -- you clicked on a call-to-action (CTA) in an email, on a social media post, or somewhere else. A CTA is a link or visual object that entices the visitor to click and arrive on a landing page that will get them further engaged with your company. Since your ebook readers have probably converted into leads in order to get their hands on your ebook to begin with (more on this in Step 2 below), use the CTAs within your ebook to reconvert your readers and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/31406/How-to-Map-Lead-Nurturing-Content-to-Each-Stage-in-the-Sales-Cycle.aspx\">propel them further down your marketing funnel</a>.</p> \n<p>For instance, a CTA can lead to another offer, your annual conference's registration page, or even a product page. Depending on what this next action is, CTAs can be an in-line rectangle or a full page teasing the next offer (see both images below).</p> \n<p>To hyperlink the CTA in your ebook (or any image or text in your ebook) to your destination URL, simply go to <strong>Insert &gt;&gt; Hyperlink</strong> in PowerPoint.</p> \n<p><img style=\"width: 618px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-362721066-png/Blog-Related_Images/how-to-create-an-ebook-8-1.png?width=618&amp;height=444&amp;name=how-to-create-an-ebook-8-1.png\" alt=\"examples of using hyperlinks in ebook template\" width=\"618\" height=\"444\"></p> \n<em style=\"letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: transparent;\"><em style=\"letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: transparent;\"><img style=\"width: 618px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"how-to-create-an-ebook-10\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-360054779-png/Blog-Related_Images/how-to-create-an-ebook-10-1.png?width=618&amp;height=444&amp;name=how-to-create-an-ebook-10-1.png\" alt=\"example of including a call to action within an ebook template\" width=\"618\" height=\"444\"></em></em> \n<p>We've even designed 50 customizable calls-to-action in PowerPoint you can download and use in your ebooks. <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/call-to-action-templates\"><strong>You can grab them here</strong></a>.</p> \n<p>Now, we don't have a dedicated CTA template slide in the PowerPoint ebook templates for you to customize ... but it's still simple! All you have to do is duplicate slide four (the Header/Subheader slide) and customize copy or add images as needed. You can also go to <strong>Insert &gt;&gt; New Slide</strong> and work from there.</p> \n<h3>9. Convert it into a PDF.</h3> \n<p>Once you've finished writing your ebook -- CTAs and all -- it's time to convert it to the right file type so it's transferrable from you to your recipient.</p> \n<p>To convert your ebook to a PDF, click <strong>File &gt;&gt; Save As</strong> in the ebook template you have open. Under <strong>File Format</strong>, select <strong>PDF</strong> and select a destination on your computer for this new file.</p> \n<p>Why can't you just attach what you have to a landing page and be done with it? Word documents, PowerPoints, and similar templates are perfect for creating your ebook, but not for delivering it. Because these templates are editable, the contents of your ebook are too easily corrupted, distorted, or even lost when moving from your computer to the hands of your future leads. That's where PDFs come in.</p> \n<p>You've seen these letters at the end of files before. Short for Portable Document Format, the .PDF file type essentially freezes your ebook so it can be displayed clearly on any device. A popular alternative to PDFs is the .EPUB file type. See a <a href=\"https://www.thoughtco.com/epub-vs-pdf-3467286\">comparison of EPUB to PDF here</a>.</p> \n<h3>10. Create a dedicated landing page for your ebook.</h3> \n<p>Your ebook should be available for download through a landing page on your site. A <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/an-introductory-guide-how-to-use-landing-pages-for-your-business\">landing page</a> is a web page that promotes/describes your offer and provides a form that visitors need to fill out with their contact information in order to access your ebook. This is how you are able to convert your visitors into business leads that your sales team can ultimately follow up with.</p> \n<p>For instance, you went through <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/ebook-templates\">this landing page</a> in order to access this ebook template. To learn more about how to optimize your landing pages for conversion, <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/optimize-landing-pages-more-leads\">download this free ebook</a>.</p> \n<p><img style=\"width: 618px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-363216512-png/Blog-Related_Images/how-to-create-an-ebook-9-1.png?width=618&amp;height=444&amp;name=how-to-create-an-ebook-9-1.png\" alt=\"how-to-create-an-ebook-9-1\" width=\"618\" height=\"444\"></p> \n<h3>11. Promote your ebook and track its success.</h3> \n<p>Once your landing page is all set, you can use that destination URL to promote your ebook across your marketing channels. Here are five ways you can do this:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Advertise your new ebook on your website. For example, feature a CTA or link to your offer’s landing page on your resources page or even your homepage.</li> \n <li>Promote your ebook through your blog. For instance, consider publishing an excerpt of your ebook as a blog post. Or write a separate blog article on the same topic as your ebook, and link to it at the end of your post using a call-to-action to encourage readers to keep learning. <em>(Note: This very blog post is the perfect example of how to promote an offer you created with a blog post.)</em></li> \n <li>Send a segmented email to contacts who have indicated an interest in receiving offers from your company.</li> \n <li>Leverage paid advertising and co-marketing partnerships that will help you promote your ebook to a new audience.</li> \n <li>Publish posts to social media with a link to your ebook. You can also increase social shares by creating social media share buttons within your ebook, such as the ones at the bottom right of this ebook. <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33402/A-Simple-Guide-to-Creating-Social-Media-Sharing-Links-for-Your-Ebooks.aspx\">Here’s a blog post that shows how to hyperlink them</a>.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>After your content is launched and promoted across your marketing channels, you’ll also want <strong>marketing analytics</strong> in place to measure the success of your live product.</p> \n<p>For instance, you should have landing page analytics that give you insight into how many people downloaded your ebook and converted into leads, and closed-loop analytics that show how many of those people ultimately converted into opportunities and customers for your business. Learn more through <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/landing-pages\">HubSpot's Landing Pages App</a>.</p> \n<p>And with that, we've built an ebook, folks! You can check out the packaged version of the example I built through this post here:</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" style=\"width: 420px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-364748345-gif/Blog-Related_Images/5-free-ebook-Templates.gif?width=418&amp;height=552&amp;name=5-free-ebook-Templates.gif\" alt=\"an animation that scrolls through several pages of an ebook template\" width=\"418\" height=\"552\"></p> \n<div style=\"position: absolute; top: 2156px; left: 0; background: red; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;\"> \n <div>\n  After your content is launched and promoted across your marketing channels, you’ll need to have marketing analytics in place that measure the success of your ebooks. For instance, having landing page analytics that give you insight into how many people downloaded your ebook, or show how many of those downloaders converted into opportunities and customers for your business.\n </div> \n</div> \n<h2>Ebook Ideas</h2> \n<p>So, what should you write about in your ebook? I'll answer that question with another question: What do you want your readers to get out of this ebook? To identify an ebook idea that suits your audience, consider the&nbsp;<em>type</em> of ebook you're trying to create. Here are a few ideas.</p> \n<h3>New Research</h3> \n<p>Conducting an experiment or business survey? This is a great way to develop proprietary knowledge and become a thought leader in your industry. But how will you share your findings with the people who care about it? Create an ebook that describes the experiment, what you intended to find out, what the results of the experiment were, and what these findings mean for your readers and the market at large.</p> \n<h3>Case Study</h3> \n<p>People love success stories, especially if these people are on the fence about purchasing something from you. If you have a client whose business you're particularly proud to have, why not tell their story in an ebook?</p> \n<p>Ebook case studies show your buyers that other people trust you and have benefited from your product or service. In your ebook, describe what your client's challenge was, how you connected with them, and how you were able to help your client solve their challenge and become successful.</p> \n<h3>Product Demo</h3> \n<p>The more complex your product is, the more information your customers will need to use it correctly. If your product or service can be used in multiple ways, or it's hard to set up alone, dedicate a brief ebook to showing people how it's done. In the first section of your ebook, for example, explain how to launch your product or service. In the second section, break down the individual features and purposes your product is best used for.</p> \n<h3>Interview</h3> \n<p>Interested in interviewing a well-known person in your market? Perhaps you've already sat down with an influencer to pick their brain about the future of the industry. Package this interview into an ebook, making it easy for your customers to read and share your inside scoop.</p> \n<h3>Playbook</h3> \n<p>A \"playbook\" is a document people can use when taking on a new project or concept that is foreign to them. Think of it like a cheat sheet, full of tips and tricks that help your customers get better at what they do.</p> \n<p>When done right, a playbook equips your customers with information they would need to excel when using your product. For example, a software vendor for IT professionals might create a \"virus protection playbook\" that makes support teams better at preventing viruses at their respective companies.</p> \n<h3>Blog Post Series</h3> \n<p>Sometimes, the best ebook for your business is already strewn across a series of blog posts. If you've spent the last month writing articles all on the same subject for your business, imagine how these posts would look stitched together?</p> \n<p>Each article can begin a new chapter. Then, once this ebook is created, you can promote it on a landing page, link to this landing page from each individual blog post, and generate leads from readers who want to download the entire blog series in one convenient ebook.</p> \n<h2>Ebook Creation Resources</h2> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/ebook-templates\">5 Free Ebook Templates in PowerPoint and InDesign</a> [Free Download]</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/13-free-customisable-ebook-templates\">13 More Customizable Ebook Templates in PowerPoint</a> [Free Download]</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/data-visualization-guide\">Data Visualization 101: How to Design Charts and Graphs</a> [Free Download]</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/repurpose-blog-content-ebook-ht\">How to Easily Turn Blog Posts Into an Ebook</a> [Blog Post]</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33402/A-Simple-Guide-to-Creating-Social-Media-Sharing-Links-for-Your-Ebooks.aspx\">A Simple Guide to Creating Social Sharing Links for Your Ebooks</a> [Blog Post]</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Do you have any other tips or resources for making ebook creation easier?

That's where the concept of <em>customer marketing</em> comes in — a school of marketing that allows you to get much more out of your customers than their initial business.</p> \n<p>Let's take a more thorough look at what customer marketing is and a picture of the five key elements of a successful customer-driven marketing strategy.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Customer marketing is, in large part, the art of building customer loyalty and enthusiasm in the hope that those elements will ultimately translate to new business. And in the context of the practice, the term \"new\" takes on multiple meanings.</p> \n<p>\"New\" business could mean existing customers buying new products or services as you develop them. It could mean current customers <em>upgrading</em> the products of yours they currently leverage or upping the tier of your service they subscribe to.</p> \n<p>Or, and perhaps most importantly, it could mean customers being enthusiastic enough about your business to evangelize to their friends and family about how awesome your company is to attract new customers <em>for you</em>.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, a solid customer-driven marketing strategy is a way to leverage your current customers as marketing assets. The process is incredibly useful — but often tricky to navigate. Here are some of the key components of an effective customer-driven marketing strategy.</p> \n<h3>1. Leverage buyer personas to segment and understand your customers.</h3> \n<p>This point applies to virtually every kind of marketing, and a customer-driven marketing strategy is no exception. The success of these kinds of efforts inevitably leans on your ability to understand and approach the people you're trying to appeal to. That's why it's in your best interest to use detailed buyer personas to guide your customer marketing efforts.</p> \n<p>As per HubSpot's <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/buyer-persona-research\">own definition</a>, a buyer persona is \"<em>a semi-fictional representation of your ideal customers based on data and research.</em>\" Who are your customers? Can you identify multiple segments with different interests and sensitivities? What kind of customer marketing will best suit those various bases?</p> \n<p>For instance, say you're in the B2B SaaS space, and various iterations of your software are consistently bought by both freelance developers and decision-makers at midsize businesses.</p> \n<p>Those two groups would warrant the creation of two separate personas — ones that will probably be fundamentally different in how they approach your product and can be best appealed to.</p> \n<p>Say you've recently released a new paid add-on to your program tailored to appeal to companies with over 100 employees and want to sell to established customers.</p> \n<p>If you wanted to create an email campaign to support your customer-driven marketing efforts, you would refer to your midsize business decision-maker persona for cues on appropriate messaging and specific contacts.</p> \n<p>That way, your customer marketing effort would be adeptly targeted. You would reach the most interested customers with appropriate content — all without bothering or alienating your other base.</p> \n<p>One way or another, you have to know your customers before you can market to them effectively. Creating, maintaining, and referring to detailed buyer personas is central to that process. You can learn more about the nature and process of creating buyer personas <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/buyer-persona-research\">here</a>.</p> \n<h3>2. Provide exemplary customer service.</h3> \n<p>Two of the primary endgames of a customer-driven marketing strategy are garnering customer loyalty and facilitating customer evangelism. Those factors tend to hinge upon your customers' experiences — their experiences with your product or service and their experiences with your company as a whole.</p> \n<p>The latter tends to be easier to control than the former, so investing in customer service is always a must. Make sure your customer support infrastructure is sound.</p> \n<p>Be thorough and responsive when addressing individual customers' problems and concerns with your product — whether that be through email, over <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/crm/live-chat\">live chat</a>, on the phone, or in person.</p> \n<p>Have that structure in place and those resources on-hand to ensure that any potential problems your customers might have are immediately, patiently, and thoughtfully addressed.</p> \n<p>They'll help you delight your customers and provide specific insight into what you could be doing better — two actions that will inform your customer marketing strategy and allow you to maintain a happier customer base that will be more receptive to it.</p> \n<h3>3. Listen to and engage with your customers.</h3> \n<p>Customer feedback is central to the efficacy of any customer marketing strategy. How can you know what your customers want and expect out of your company if you don't listen to them? If you ignore their thoughts and input, you're undermining your ability to appeal to them as meaningfully as possible.</p> \n<p>Pay careful attention to how customers are interacting with your brand on social media. Hear what they say over those platforms and be willing to adjust your product development, messaging, outreach, and customer-driven marketing strategies accordingly.</p> \n<p>In many cases, just looking and listening won't be enough. <em>Engage</em> with your customers online. Actively interact with them on social media. Ask for their feedback and insight yourself. Address issues and concerns that they might be raising personally.</p> \n<p>Your customer-driven marketing strategy, at its core, is a means of cultivating and capitalizing on customer satisfaction. One of the best ways to do both is to let customers know that you care, are willing to listen, and will act on the feedback they offer.</p> \n<p>Consistently demonstrating that you're willing to do all that can be huge in the context of a successful customer-driven marketing strategy.</p> \n<h3>4. Incentivize loyalty.</h3> \n<p>Sustaining — if not consistently improving — impressive customer retention needs to be at the heart of your customer-driven marketing efforts. Your customers need to be loyal if you want to sell them on any new products or keep them on board as long as possible. But how can you help develop and foster that kind of loyalty?</p> \n<p>The two prior points — providing exceptional customer service and engaging with your customers — are significant parts of that process. But there are certain programs and strategies you can implement to give your pushes for customer loyalty a little extra <em>oomph</em>.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service/customer-loyalty\">Customer loyalty</a> programs — incentivizing long term business with current customers through avenues like offering free merchandise, rewards, coupons, or even advance released products — are always worth considering when it comes to customer marketing.</p> \n<p>Give your customers tangible, immediate reasons to remain loyal. Again, this point ties into the overarching theme this article keeps touching on — letting customers know you care.</p> \n<p>The customers who have remained with your business want to know they're not being taken for granted. And newer customers could always use a few extra reasons to plan on staying with you in the long run.</p> \n<p>Customer loyalty programs are one of the better, more straightforward ways to supplement an effective customer-driven marketing strategy. So no matter the nature of your business, give some serious thought to incorporating one into your customer marketing efforts.</p> \n<h3>5. Have systems and strategies in place to generate referrals.</h3> \n<p>This point is where customer marketing and traditional marketing intersect. It's one of the most clear-cut ways to translate general loyalty into new business — all while keeping current customers enthusiastic about your company.</p> \n<p>There's tremendous utility, versatility, and value in a well-constructed <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service/customer-referral-program\">customer referral program</a>. It's essentially an official channel through which you can turn customers into evangelists — a program that incentivizes the projection of positive, customer-generated publicity.</p> \n<p>If you can put together a referral program with simple instructions and attractive rewards, you can give your customers a personal stake in promoting your business.</p> \n<p>It keeps them engaged, makes them articulate the value of your product or service to their friends, and ultimately wins you new customers while making the current ones that much happier with your business.</p> \n<p>One of the main — or perhaps <em>the</em> main — endgames to implementing a customer-driven marketing strategy is to turn your customers into spokespeople. A customer referral program expedites that process.</p> \n<p>Regardless of the size or nature of your business, you stand to gain a lot from carrying out effective customer marketing. Once you have customers on board, the last thing you should do is cast them by the wayside. There's tremendous potential in meaningfully engaging with and appealing to them, so it's worth your time to research and construct a solid customer-driven marketing strategy.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fcustomer-marketing&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 27 Jul 2020 12:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/CUSTOMERMARKETING%20%281%29.jpg#keepProtocol","linkMd5":"2ceb878aaab0abf82594ce351d40a9ef","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn13@2020_4/2020-07-30/1596118303968_0821fd1005f7371d.webp","metaImg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/CUSTOMERMARKETING%20%281%29.jpg#keepProtocol","author":"jfuchs@hubspot.com (Jay Fuchs)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fcustomer-marketing&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn17@2020_4/2020-07-30/1596118308271_0b3a3015d3464a09.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-07-30 22:11:40","updatedTime":"2020-07-30 14:11:40","title":"How to Conduct Successful Remote Interviews, According to HubSpot's Recruitment Coordinator","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/remote-interviewing-best-practices","description":"<p>For your business to thrive, it's critical you set up a process for conducting effective interviews — and, in 2020, it's equally vital you create a comprehensive <em>virtual </em>interview strategy, as well.</p>  \n<p>As a Program Coordinator on HubSpot's Recruiting Operations Team, I'm familiar with the struggles of creating a cohesive remote interview experience. But, as HubSpot continues to grow globally, I also know how important it is to create a scalable remote candidate interviewing process.</p> \n<p>Plus, at HubSpot, we have a strong commitment to global-first and remote inclusion — so further developing our remote interview practices only makes sense.</p> \n<p>While there's no \"secret sauce\" to remote interviewing, we've iterated on a process that helps both candidates and interviewers have strong, purposeful conversations virtually.</p> \n<p>Here, I'm going to tell you about the best practices we've learned as a result of listening to both candidate and interviewer feedback so you can learn how to create your own powerful virtual recruitment process in 2020.</p> \n<h2>How to Conduct Successful Remote Interviews</h2> \n<h3>1. Be human and keep the personal touch.</h3> \n<p>While it’s a bit harder to make a personal connection when interviewing remotely, putting in the extra effort can be the difference between an average and remarkable candidate experience.</p> \n<p>There are many ways to do this, but some efforts our candidates are loving are:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Providing 15-minute prep calls with recruiters if candidates are nervous about interviewing remotely. We want to set up candidates for success, so having quick sessions to familiarize themselves with Zoom (our video conferencing tool of choice) and have a test run can make all the difference.</li> \n <li>Hold a virtual meet-and-greet before the interview starts, so you can have a pulse check with your candidate, workout any pre-interview jitters, and make sure they are comfortable before handing them off to their first interviewer.</li> \n <li>Over-communicate the interview logistics to the candidate so they know exactly when the interview starts and how the exchange between interviewers will work to ensure a smooth process.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>2. Knowledge and resources are power.</h3> \n<p>Interviewing remotely presents its own set of unique challenges for candidates: how to prepare, what to wear, and how to get an idea of the office, team, or culture they could be joining.</p> \n<p>The good news is that there are many ways you can share information and resources with candidates to fill these gaps, such as:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>A one-pager for how to prepare your work space, download your video conferencing software of choice, and practice with it</li> \n <li>This blog post: <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/careers-blog/video-interviews-how-to-prepare\">How to Prepare for Your Video Interview Debut</a></li> \n <li>Virtual office tours</li> \n <li>Content that gives candidates a glimpse into your culture and lets it shine, like your YouTube channel, your brand's Instagram page, or your business's Glassdoor page</li> \n <li>Team lunches or weekly stand-ups, to give candidates a look at their future team’s culture</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>3. Remote interviewing can feel very different from in-person, so make it as comfortable as possible.</h3> \n<p>Without the natural flow and physical reminders of an in-person interview, it’s easy to forget the small things that would make a remote interview just as comfortable as coming into the office.</p> \n<p>Here are some small things that you can do to make your candidates feel as comfortable as possible:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Before starting your interview, offer the candidate a water and restroom break.</li> \n <li>Ideally, take notes on paper so that you’re not typing while the person is talking. If you’ll be taking notes on the computer, call out the fact that you’ll be typing during the interview. In this scenario, it’s also best to mute yourself so that you’re not typing in their ears as they’re speaking, but keep in mind that for them it will feel like they’re talking to a silent crowd.</li> \n <li>Don’t lose the small talk you would normally have with candidates in-person.</li> \n <li>Be overly expressive — interviews are extra stressful when it’s hard to read body language. Nod, smile, and laugh, to help make the situation more comfortable.</li> \n <li>Include a \"breather\" whenever possible by building in 10 to 15-minute breaks in the interview schedule.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>4. Channel your inner technology support specialist.</h3> \n<p>While most of our interviewers aren’t in tech support roles, it’s easy to forget that we use remote collaboration tools regularly, so we may be (and usually are) more experienced using and troubleshooting issues that can come up during a remote interview.</p> \n<p>Technology issues can happen, so don’t panic and stay strong in the face of adversity. Here are some of our tips for working through tech issues:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>When in doubt, leave and rejoin the meeting. If that doesn’t work, we recommend giving the candidate a call (which we list in all of our interview calendar invites).</li> \n <li>If the issue is Wi-Fi connectivity, the first troubleshooting step we recommend is suggesting that the candidate move closer to the wifi router (if able). Second step would be to turn off video and attempt to communicate just over audio. Third and final step would be to switch the call to take place over the phone.</li> \n <li>If you’re spending more than five minutes troubleshooting tech issues, it may be best to reschedule for a later time. Work with your internal stakeholders to make it happen.</li> \n <li>At HubSpot, we use Zoom, so keeping <a href=\"https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/sections/200305593-Troubleshooting\">Zoom’s troubleshooting guide</a> open makes it easier to search and troubleshoot on-the-fly.

Have ground rules in place for your first meeting.</h3> \n<p>Whether it's your <a href=\"https://academy.hubspot.com/lessons/remote-leadership?utm_source=marketing_blog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=remote_leadership\">first time managing a remote team</a> or your team is suddenly working from home, virtual meetings are often a new environment for everyone. So it's important to lay some ground rules for how meetings will work and what you expect from your attendees.</p> \n<p>Here are a few things to consider:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Video:</strong> Encourage attendees to use their video for meetings as this allows us to better engage with each other through non-verbal communication.</li> \n <li><strong>Audio:</strong> Generally speaking, it's best practice to stay muted in a virtual meeting unless you're presenting or answering a question. This prevents background noise from becoming a distraction and creates a signal (unmuting) when someone has something to say.</li> \n <li><strong>Engagement:</strong> Be clear about how you expect participants to engage in meetings (see Tip #3 for more details).</li> \n <li><strong>Etiquette:</strong> Be intentional in calling out meeting etiquette expectations. Some common ones that come up are use of phones, having to step away from your desk, checking notifications, or eating during meetings. If you have specific expectations around meeting etiquette, be explicit about this up front with your attendees.</li> \n <li><strong>Set the Stage:</strong> If you're meeting with a larger group, it can be helpful to set expectations on a starting slide that attendees will see upon entering the meeting.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>For instance, at HubSpot, I often present with this slide at the beginning, so my attendees know ground rules for the meeting:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202020-04-30%20at%2010.34.27%20AM.png?width=1500&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202020-04-30%20at%2010.34.27%20AM.png\" alt=\"how to work from home\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">Additionally, you might consider including a slide that says, \"Record the meeting\", as a reminder for yourself, in case anyone misses the meeting or wants to refer back to it later.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>2. Take some time to break the ice.</h3> \n<p>Virtual environments can be intimidating, especially if you aren't accustomed to them or if you're meeting with folks you're unfamiliar with. To warm things up, we recommend <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ice-breaker-games\">starting your meetings with an icebreaker</a>. It's a great way to test that everyone's audio works properly and it's an even better way to learn more about each other and get everyone feeling comfortable before jumping into the agenda.</p> \n<p>To make this easier, we suggest:</p> \n<p><strong>Keep it simple: </strong><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">Depending on the meeting, it might make sense to start with a standard question such as \"How are you feeling today?\"</span></p> \n<p><strong>Mix it up:</strong><span style=\"color: #33475b;\"> If you have the time, try mixing in some unique ice breakers to get to know each other better (take a look at some of </span><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ice-breaker-games\">our suggestions here</a><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">).</span></p> \n<p><strong>Pass the microphone:</strong><span style=\"color: #33475b;\"> We're all likely familiar with that awkward silence that occurs when everyone is expecting someone else to jump in. To solve for this, encourage teams to “Pass the Microphone” to each other after their own answer. </span></p> \n<p><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">If everyone is expected to provide an answer, have the host start and then pass the proverbial microphone to any participant. Once that participant answers, they'll end their statement with, \"Next, I'll pass the microphone to [name].” This keeps the conversation moving and prevents the awkward silence of waiting for someone else to jump in.</span></p> \n<h3>3. Determine a structure for how you expect participants to engage during the meeting.</h3> \n<p>It's not always obvious how folks should provide feedback or answers during a virtual meeting. To keep the conversation flowing, determine a structure for how you expect participants to engage during meetings, and be upfront about these expectations at the start of the meeting.</p> \n<p>A few of our favorite strategies are:</p> \n<p><strong>Raise your virtual hand.</strong>&nbsp;Many virtual meeting platforms have non-verbal feedback tools that allow a participant to indicate they have a question — for example, Zoom's “<a href=\"https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115001286183-Nonverbal-Feedback-During-Meetings\">raise hand</a>” feature. For large meetings, ask folks to use these tools to indicate when they have a question or input and the host can then call on them directly. This can also be a great way to have a quick yes/no question answered by the group and expanded upon.</p> \n<p><em>Example: “Raise your hand if you have had a positive interaction with an external Support team.” Based on who raises their hand, you can then call on one person to expand on that answer if needed.</em></p> \n<p><strong>Use the chat feature:</strong> For quick questions, you may ask folks to enter their answers into the chat (for instance, <a href=\"https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/9300511?hl=en\">Google Hangouts' Chat feature</a>). This allows you to quickly hear answers from a large group and allows everyone to learn from each other's answer. In addition, as our APAC Customer Success Trainer, Mariel Argonza, points out, this is also a great way to be inclusive of attendees who use English as a Second Language.</p> \n<p><em><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">Example: “How is everyone feeling today? Describe it in one word in the chat pane.”</span></em></p> \n<p><strong>Jump in:</strong><span style=\"color: #33475b;\"> Depending on the size of your meeting and psychological safety of your attendees, you may opt to have folks simply jump in with their feedback and questions. As the facilitator, it's important to be cognizant of participation in order to ensure that one individual isn't dominating the conversation.</span></p> \n<p><em><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">Example: “Can anyone tell me the definition of Inbound Marketing? Feel free to jump right in.”</span></em></p> \n<h3>4. Ensure every attendee is on the same page.</h3> \n<p>Depending on the nature of your meeting, you may need some additional tools to get on the same page with your idea, such as a virtual whiteboard or collaboration tool. Some of our favorites include:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Virtual Whiteboard: </strong>Many of the virtual meeting tools have a native whiteboard tool built in that will allow attendees to whiteboard their ideas as well as save their whiteboard images for future use.</li> \n <li><strong>Share Your Screen:</strong> Looking at an email you need help with or struggling to explain a glitch you're seeing? Use a screen sharing tool such as <a href=\"https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362153-Sharing-your-screen\">Zoom's Screen Share</a> so that your attendees can see what you're seeing from your point of view.</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://jamboard.google.com/\"><strong>JamBoard</strong><strong>:</strong></a> Part of GSuite, JamBoard allows you to use a virtual whiteboard, insert pictures and text, and save/share your whiteboard for future use.</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.lucidchart.com/\"><strong>LucidChart</strong><strong>:</strong></a> Lucidchart is a visual productivity platform that helps individuals understand and share ideas, information, and processes with clarity.</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://miro.com/\"><strong>Miro</strong></a>: Miro is an online whiteboard tool that allows distributed teams to collaborate virtually from wherever they may be seated.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>5. <span style=\"color: #33475b;\">Stay on track with a clear agenda or slides.</span></h3> \n<p>Even with a clear agenda, it can be challenging to keep a conversation on track — and on time — in a virtual setting. To help your meeting stay on course, try:</p> \n<p><strong>Circulate the agenda:</strong><span style=\"color: #33475b;\"> In the meeting invitation, make it clear what topics you'll be discussing, what's expected of attendees in terms of preparation, and what the outcomes of the meeting will be.</span></p> \n<p><strong>Pause:</strong><span style=\"color: #33475b;\"> When everyone is on mute and staring at you on camera, it can be instinctual to race through your notes without coming up for air. However, in a virtual atmosphere, it's more important than ever to slow down and pause often to ensure that folks have an opportunity to jump in, slower WiFi connections can catch up with a delayed sound response, and participants have the opportunity to digest your words.</span></p> \n<p><strong>Ask for questions:</strong><span style=\"color: #33475b;\"> In a virtual setting, you may not always catch a confused look and folks might not feel as comfortable interrupting you for clarification. So, intentionally ask your participants - what questions do you have for me? Pause longer than you normally would to wait for questions.</span></p> \n<p><strong>Use slides to stay on-track:</strong><span style=\"color: #33475b;\"> Having a visual to keep you on track will allow everyone to be more organized and focused during the meeting. You can choose to send slides out in advance of or following the meeting, but it's a helpful way to have a record of what was discussed. In addition, sending out slides means that folks won't have to take as many notes (and therefore won't spend the meeting typing).</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"color: #33475b;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202020-04-30%20at%2011.16.07%20AM.png?width=1500&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202020-04-30%20at%2011.16.07%20AM.png\" alt=\"how to use slides to stick to your agenda\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></span></p> \n<p>Even with preparation, you're likely to encounter some awkward pauses, technical glitches, and uncomfortable moments. But, we encourage you to embrace these moments, learn from them, and move past them. We're all in this together after all!</p> \n<p>If you're just starting out with virtual meetings, we encourage you to be honest with your team that this is a skill you're working on. Practice different techniques to find what works best for you. Ask for feedback from your team on what's working in the context of your meetings and what isn't.</p> \n<p>Plus, when you find something that works for you, share it with others so that we can all learn together.</p> \n<p><em>Editor's note: This post was originally published in May 2020 and has been updated for comprehensiveness.</em></p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fremote-meetings-tips&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 22 Jul 2020 12:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/virtual-meeting-tips.jpg#keepProtocol","linkMd5":"ed29eaa13d76ef551dc1ee22d2123d08","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn5@2020_5/2020-07-30/1596118303666_cae9d0dbe0d581b2.webp","metaImg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/virtual-meeting-tips.jpg#keepProtocol","author":"Meaghan Williams","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202020-04-30%20at%2010.34.27%20AM.png?width=1500&name=Screen%20Shot%202020-04-30%20at%2010.34.27%20AM.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn49@2020_2/2020-07-30/1596118307362_915ed3a91f5e4d26.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202020-04-30%20at%2011.16.07%20AM.png?width=1500&name=Screen%20Shot%202020-04-30%20at%2011.16.07%20AM.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn73@2020_4/2020-07-30/1596118310311_43949c4291c2b9f8.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fremote-meetings-tips&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn5@2020_5/2020-07-30/1596118312410_21748a85ba45ae02.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-07-30 22:11:40","updatedTime":"2020-07-30 14:11:40","title":"Email Sign Up Forms: How to Increase Email Sign Ups With Better Forms","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/email-sign-up-form","description":"<p>In 2019, there were <a href=\"https://www.campaignmonitor.com/resources/knowledge-base/how-many-people-in-the-world-use-email/\" style=\"font-size: 1.1rem;\">3.8 billion</a> estimated email users across the globe.&nbsp;With half of the world’s population on email, and the ability to reach people at any time of day, email marketing remains a crucial technique to build a customer base.</p> \n<p>So how do you attract people to your email list? There are a few important steps, but it all starts with an email sign up <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/web-forms\">web form</a>.</p> \n<div class=\"hsg-featured-snippet\"> \n <h2>What Is An Email Sign Up Form?</h2> \n <p>An email sign up form is used to collect email addresses from leads and potential customers. These forms are are embedded on a web page where a visitor can enter their email address in a form field to be added to your email newsletter.&nbsp;</p> \n</div> \n<p>The best thing about email opt-ins is that you can build a pipeline of leads to nurture and communicate with. Over time, your email list can turn into a valuable source of revenue as cold prospects get to know and trust you while you stay top of mind (or top of inbox).</p> \n<p>But what do you do if you're not getting enough subscribers into that pipeline? After all, email marketing is only as good as its list. Here are our tips for how to get more mailing list signups.</p> \n<div class=\"hsg-featured-snippet\"> \n <h2>How to Get More Subscribers for Your Email List</h2> \n <ol> \n  <li>Monitor your metrics.</li> \n  <li>Place calls to action on high-traffic pages.</li> \n  <li>Be mindful that your conversion rate may not be the problem.</li> \n  <li>Use contrasting colors.</li> \n  <li>Consider placement.</li> \n  <li>Offer something of value.</li> \n  <li>Reduce the friction.</li> \n  <li>Try out different offers.</li> \n  <li>Consider user intent.</li> \n  <li>Reduce the number of forms and calls to action on a page.</li> \n  <li>Use a form builder with smart field capability.</li> \n  <li>Use pop-ups.</li> \n  <li>Test everything.</li> \n </ol> \n</div> \n<h3>1. Monitor your metrics.</h3> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-is-conversion-rate-optimization-faqs\">Conversion rate</a> refers to the percentage of website visitors who converted on your opt-in. In order to calculate conversion rate, you divide the number of conversions from that form or offer by the amount of traffic to the page or post it's on.</p> \n<p>If you have a form or offer that coverts 3% of the website visitors that see it, that form or offer is more valuable than one converting at a rate of .75%. With 1000 website visitors, the first form would generate around 22 more leads than the second (all other things being equal). That's why <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.de/marketing/conversion-rate-optimization\">conversion rate optimization</a> is so important.</p> \n<h3>2. Place calls to action on high-traffic pages.</h3> \n<p>Conversions to your email signup form only happen if the form is seen. For this reason, you should be putting the opportunity in front of your website visitors. Identify your highly visited pages and put your form or <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-is-call-to-action-faqs-ht\">calls to action</a> (CTAs) on them to maximize visibility.</p> \n<h3>3. Be mindful that your conversion rate may not be the problem.</h3> \n<p>If you don't have a large amount of traffic, finding ways to increase traffic may be a more worthwhile activity. As previously mentioned, conversions only happen when there's an opportunity to convert. With no traffic, there's no opportunity. You won't have the means to increase conversion rate if the starting number is zero, and if traffic is low, your conversion rates may not be statistically significant.</p> \n<h3>4. Use contrasting colors.</h3> \n<p>The last thing you want is for a potential subscriber to miss the opportunity to convert simply because they didn't notice it was there. You want to draw attention to your conversion elements, making them attention-grabbing and bold. One way to do this is by using contrasting colors that stand out on the page.</p> \n<h3>5. Consider placement.</h3> \n<p>Prominent page placement is a game-changer when it comes to increasing conversion rates on email signup forms. A form or call-to-action can go in a number of places, including:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>The top of the page</li> \n <li>Within the text of the page</li> \n <li>In the sidebar</li> \n <li>At the bottom of the page</li> \n <li>As a popup generated from a user action</li> \n</ul> \n<p>You'll want to test which placements work for your conversion rates. For example, if people aren't making it to the bottom of a page or post, they may not see your call-to-action. Through testing, you'll be able to determine the placements that work best for your audience.</p> \n<h3>6. Offer something of value.</h3> \n<p>The majority of today's internet users know that giving up their email address may result in email solicitation or, in some cases, spam. That may not be your intention, but that doesn't erase their caution. To overcome their caution, you must incentivize them to give it up.</p> \n<p>Promising high-value content that they want, providing social proof that your newsletter is valuable, holding giveaways or contests, and being transparent about what they can expect signing up are all ways to provide the incentive.</p> \n<h3>7. Reduce the friction.</h3> \n<blockquote> \n <p>\"Dollars flow where friction is low.\"&nbsp;</p> \n <p style=\"font-size: 18px;\">— Brian Halligan, INBOUND 2019</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>The more friction that a visitor encounters, the less likely they'll sign up. Ultimately, you want to keep the momentum going to completion.</p> \n<p>One way that you can reduce friction is by removing form fields and making the process of signing up faster. The amount of required form fields should be proportional to the amount of value you're providing. Too many will cause the user to bounce. Instead, ask for less up front and have your team gather what they need after the individual has become a lead.</p> \n<h3>8. Try out different offers.</h3> \n<p>Don't be afraid to scrap an offer if it seems to be under-performing. Maybe the word \"newsletter\" fails to appeal to your specific audience. Switch it out with something different and monitor your metrics to see what happens.</p> \n<h3>9. Consider user intent.</h3> \n<p>Your website visitors landed on a particular page for a reason. If your offer doesn't help them meet that need in some way, they may not be incentivized to convert.</p> \n<p>Here's an example to illustrate this point:</p> \n<p>Let's say you have a blog post that compares your product/service to a competitors. The visitor arrived here because they want to see how well you match up with others in the industry.</p> \n<p>But if your offer is something like \"Reasons Why You Should Buy [Product/Service],\" you may fall flat. If the user is already comparing providers, they already know they the value of the product or service; they're just figuring out which provider to go with.</p> \n<p>In this scenario, an offer suited to this intent, such as a free sample or product demo, may work much better.</p> \n<p>Consider the intent on your pages and craft offers that match up with that intent.</p> \n<h3>10. Reduce the number of forms and calls to action on a page.</h3> \n<p>As the old saying goes, \"A confused mind says no.\" If you present a website visitors with too many choices, you run the risk of driving them away completely. Consider presenting one offer or conversion element per page. If that's not possible, find other ways to reduce the confusion and make it clear exactly what you want the website visitor to do.</p> \n<h3>11. Use a form builder with <a href=\"https://knowledge.hubspot.com/forms/use-progressive-fields-in-forms\">progressive field</a> capability.</h3> \n<p>Some <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/forms\">form builders</a> (like HubSpot's) have the ability to remove form fields if the CRM already knows the information. For users who may be converting a second time, HubSpot may already already know some of the information, and it will remove those unnecessary forms, removing the friction for the user to type that information again. After all, dollars flow where friction is low.</p> \n<h3>12. Use pop-ups.</h3> \n<p>Pop-ups may seem intrusive, especially if used incorrectly, but the fact of the matter is that they convert! By using a <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/pop-up-form\">pop-ups tool</a>, offering something of value, and using specific triggers (such as exit intent), you can create a pop-up experience that isn't annoying and generates leads.</p> \n<h3>13. Test everything.</h3> \n<p>Testing has been mentioned already in a few of the tips above, but it stands to get its own section. Improvement doesn't happen in a vacuum, and leads don't increase because of intuition. By testing hypothesis and continuing to iterate improvements, you'll learn about your audience, be mindful about your metrics, and increase email signups as a result.</p> \n<p>A lead might provide their email address for any number of reasons — to receive details about sales, blog post notifications, a discount code or information about your business. Either way, that makes your email sign up form one of the most important things on your site. And while they're&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.formisimo.com/blog/top-15-online-form-building-tools-on-the-market/\">simple to create</a>&nbsp;with the help of a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/forms?_ga=2.125593866.1682462320.1538429223-1384912595.1528309621\">form builder</a>, you’ll still need to put some time and thought into how you build, format and embed your form.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Let’s go over some ways to create a sign up form that will get more leads on your email list.</p> \n<h2>Email Sign Up Form Best Practices</h2> \n<p>Whether you’re looking to reach ten people or ten million, you’ll need to create a sign up form that gets people excited to sign up.. Here are some best practices that will help you create a high-converting email sign up form</p> \n<h3>1. Make the Value Exchange Clear</h3> \n<p>Your leads should be able to answer the question, “What’s in it for me?” when they complete your form. An email address is a valuable commodity and it should be worth their while to sign up. Add a short description to the top of your email sign up form that describes what your lead will get in return for signing up and make it good. For example, instead of saying, ”Sign up for our weekly newsletter” you should say, “sign up for our newsletter and receive exclusive deals and offers.” A strong incentive means your website visitors are <a href=\"https://smartblogger.com/email-list-incentives/\">more likely to convert</a>.</p> \n<h3>2. Use a Double Opt-In</h3> \n<p>You don’t necessarily need more sign-ups as you need <em>quality</em> sign-ups. You need people who actually want to receive your emails — more is not always better. Ensuring quality sign-ups means less fake leads wasting your time and less chances that you’ll end up in the SPAM folder or <a href=\"https://knowledge.hubspot.com/articles/kcs_article/email/what-is-an-email-blacklist?_ga=2.168198561.1682462320.1538429223-1384912595.1528309621\">blacklisted</a>.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>To ensure quality sign-ups on your form, consider using a <a href=\"https://sendpulse.com/support/glossary/double-opt-in\">double opt-in</a>. This is the type of email subscription that confirms your lead wants to be added to your email list <em>twice</em>. The first time is when the lead enters and submits their information using your <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/web-forms\">web form</a>, and the second time requires the lead to click an additional CTA (usually in their inbox) that confirms their submission. A double confirmation means a high-quality relationship with your leads.</p> \n<h3>3. Keep It Simple</h3> \n<p>A lead should be able to look at the form, enter their information, hit “submit” and carry on with their lives within a matter of seconds. Successful email sign up forms are straightforward and clear. If your form is too complex, you risk losing the interest of your website visitors.</p> \n<p>Don’t get greedy and ask for too much information right away — if you do, there is a large chance you will turn people off and drive them away from your website. Keep your email sign up form as a way for visitors to sign up for emails.</p> \n<h3>4. Consider Place and Time</h3> \n<p>The placement of your email sign up form on your website matters. You should think about how you want your website visitors to find your form. For example, do you want your form to pop-up on the page the second someone lands on your website? Do you want them to scroll down to the bottom of your homepage to find your form? Or do they need to land on a specific page on your site?</p> \n<p>Form placement isn’t one-size-fits-all. Think about where most visitors land on your site, how your buyer personas want to interact with your brand and the overall user experience.</p> \n<p>Consider questions like, “Will my target audience get frustrated with a pop-up the second they enter our site, or will they find it helpful?”</p> \n<h3>5. Send a Kickback Email After Submission</h3> \n<p>Once someone completes your form, thank and welcome them.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>A<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33725/why-thank-you-emails-are-the-untapped-gold-mine-of-email-marketing.aspx?_ga=2.168198561.1682462320.1538429223-1384912595.1528309621\"> kickback email</a> is an email that gives your new lead something in return for their information. In the case of an email sign up form kickback email, you’ll want to welcome your new lead and perhaps offer them links to useful content. Thank them for their interest and get them excited about their decision to give you their personal information.

I immediately strategize about target audiences and selling tactics — especially during commercials for the <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/super-bowl/\">Super Bowl</a>.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>When a video really impresses me, I research the advertising agency that conceptualized the campaign for its clients — like this one, from Sarto Restaurant:</p> \n<div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"width: 100%; height: auto; position: relative; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; max-width: 560px; max-height: 315px; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\"> \n <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 0;\">\n  <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ircKp5Ljqw8\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n </div> \n</div> \n<p>I loved how this commercial mixed funky music with action shots. Plus, it was intertwined with an interview with the Chef Du Cuisine. Hearing about the menu, inspirations about the restaurant, and seeing the type of food being made gave me a good idea of the atmosphere in Sarto.</p> \n<p>My admiration for the commercial led me to <a href=\"https://www.erbacreate.com/?pgid=jepdpftp-43b7f8a1-d66b-483f-8d63-7aaca326a9ef\">Erba</a>, a creative agency offering a full range of marketing and advertising services. Companies leverage agencies like Erba to produce professional, effective campaigns.</p> \n<p>It's likely that the team at Sarto wanted to use an agency like Erba to raise awareness of their restaurant. But what else can creative agencies offer? And how do they make money? Let's explore those questions next.</p> \n<h3>What is a creative agency? What do they do?</h3> \n<p>An agency is an organization that offers a list of services for one specific industry. A creative agency, then, is one that offers services related to marketing and advertising.</p> \n<p>For instance, some creative agencies you'll see are ones that offer marketing services, social media scheduling, advertising and branding, influencer marketing, and more. These agencies usually have different tiers or models for how they operate, and what they offer.</p> \n<p>Creative agencies take on a large workload. They usually have a client base and execute different projects for them from start-to-finish. For instance, an influencer agency might find brand deals that relate to their niche.</p> \n<p>If this sounds pretty broad, that's because marketing agencies usually are — there's so many niches and specialties agencies can tackle. Because of the slight ambiguity, you might be wondering how these agencies operate, or even … how they make money.</p> \n<p>Agencies are a business. Businesses have plans in place to earn revenue, but there are some exceptions that are unique to agencies. Next, let's dive into a list of ways agencies stay afloat.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/how%20creative%20agencies%20make%20money.png\" alt=\"Different ways creative agencies can earn revenue. \" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n</div> \n<h2>1. Pricing Models</h2> \n<p>Every company needs a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/agency/agency-pricing-models\">pricing model</a> in order to charge for their services, and agencies are no exception. Pricing models are determined by the agency and should reflect the value of the services offered, as well as industry standards.</p> \n<p>Some pricing models are more beneficial to agencies than others — it differs from company to company. Maybe your pricing model is based on one you've seen from a different agency, but it doesn't quite work for your business goals.</p> \n<p>If you're struggling to come up with a pricing model, or your agency is outgrowing your current strategy, refer to this rundown of common ones for agencies.</p> \n<h3>Fixed Rate</h3> \n<p>If you've ever put down a deposit for a service, and then paid the rest of the rate after completion, you've participated in a fixed-rate model. This model is determined by calculating how many hours a project takes, combined with the hourly rate. That amount is split into two fees: One upfront, and one due after the project.</p> \n<p>For instance, let's say I charge $125 for social media services for one campaign. In a fixed rate model, this price is made up of projected hours needed and how much I charge per hour. In the beginning, my client and I agree to a $50 deposit, with the rest due after.</p> \n<p>This pricing model can be useful if your agency works case by case, as this method also includes the <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/agency/grow-client-retainers?_ga=2.138851760.2016131183.1595539185-940436819.1565181751\">retainer approach</a>. In a nutshell, you wouldn't need to think about how much to charge for each client because it would already be determined.</p> \n<p>However, agencies can run into an issue if the project takes much more than the projected hour amount. If that happens, the pricing should reflect the work, but that's difficult if the fee is already set. To alleviate this, specify your offerings — for instance, one Twitter campaign for one month could be its own rate.</p> \n<h3>Value-based</h3> \n<p>This pricing model is determined after a project's completion. Based on ROI, the price will be determined according to what the agency and clients agree on, sharing risk and rewards.</p> \n<p>To implement this model, you need to work through a few steps. First, you'll determine the clients' goals and make sure they're measurable. In this case, let's say the client wants to boost conversion rates with an ad campaign.</p> \n<p>After identifying the client's goals, estimating a price, and reminding the client that it's subject to change upon completion. Failing to meet goals might negate a lower price, while exceeding them would have the opposite effect.</p> \n<p>For this pricing model to work, agencies need a proven track record of exceeding customer expectations. That's why, it can be hard to sell this model if you work for a startup — you'd have little history to show past work.</p> \n<p>This model is a good choice for agencies with a solid reputation and history of high-performing projects. Showing proof of the value you give clients reinforces your rate and makes them more comfortable when choosing your agency.</p> \n<h3>Hourly Rate</h3> \n<p>An hourly rate is determined by the amount of hours a company spends working on a project for a client. In this scenario, if my social media agency ran a client's social media channels for the duration of a campaign, I would charge based on the amount of hours spent doing that.</p> \n<p>If I spent 40 hours working on a campaign at a rate of $125/hr, then I would earn $5,000 from that client. Generally, agencies come up with their hourly rate based on the seniority of the employee(s) involved, or agree on a set price across the board.</p> \n<p>This is a useful pricing model if your organization has multiple specializations. You can offer one price for the same set of services across the board. Or, you can assign the best employees for certain projects based on bandwidth.</p> \n<p>However, it can be hard to predict cash flow with this model. It can also place weariness on the client — the longer it takes to do the work, the more you get paid. So clients might be unsure about efficiency during the length of their project.</p> \n<h2>2. Advertising</h2> \n<p>Agencies often offer advertising services to help the client broadcast the campaign they've helped the client create ... Typically, agencies will take a percentage of the ROI from those ads, which is one way to make extra revenue.</p> \n<p>In the same vein, agencies can also run ads for their own company. In this case, all revenue from ads would go back directly to the organization. Let's look at those options more in-depth here.</p> \n<h3>Paid Media</h3> \n<p>Agencies can charge clients based on ROI of paid media. Ads, search results, and sponsored content that's paid to be promoted are common examples of this ad type. Usually, they're used to expand reach and traffic.</p> \n<p>For example, If I were running a social media campaign for a client, and one of my content marketing strategies included paid ads, I might consider including the cost it takes to run them in the total price I charge the client. Alternatively, I could also choose to take a percentage of the ROI after the campaign is over.</p> \n<p>The inclusion of paid ad return in projects ensures the work gets paid for, regardless of results. You can also use paid media to promote your company. Because paid media supports waiting until the end of a campaign to charge, this strategy works well with a value-based pricing model.</p> \n<h3>Owned Media</h3> \n<p>Owned media simply means all the content created by your agency. So if my social media company makes blog posts, tweets, main feed posts, pins, and other multimedia elements, those are all considered \"owned\". The purpose of this type of media is to nurture leads.</p> \n<p>Agencies can charge based on the amount of owned media created per campaign, or by agreeing on a percent of ROI with the client. For example, my social media campaign might involve 15 owned media that I can charge for all at once, or based on the client's goal.</p> \n<p>You'll want to consider using owned media to promote your brand. It'll convey the value of your company to prospects, and ideally convince them to convert.</p> \n<h2>3. Projects</h2> \n<p>Here, \"projects\" means how you offer your services. While pricing models determine how much you'll charge, this aspect focuses on what you'll provide. Agencies tackle projects in a couple of different ways, and some are unique to their own rules.</p> \n<p>Next, let's review the most common ways agencies can tackle projects.</p> \n<h3>One-off</h3> \n<p>This is a case-by-case basis. For one-off projects, the client and agency agree on a set of services and price. Generally, one-offs call for pricing models that can be flexible, so that prices can be set individually.</p> \n<p>Agencies can offer simple campaigns, content creation, or other services that meet client goals with this method. For instance, my social media company might offer ad campaigns by social media channel or duration at a fixed rate.</p> \n<p>One-off structures are useful for agencies that can sustain a flexible pricing model. Additionally, if companies offer many services that clients can choose from, one-offs keeps goals focused. This approach allows clients full customization.</p> \n<h3>Contracted Clients</h3> \n<p>Agencies can execute projects based on an agreed-upon contract signed by both parties. This contract would outline the services provided, the length of the agreement, and a rate. Typically, contracted clients are for long-term projects.</p> \n<p>Let's say my social media company signs a client with the intent of running their Facebook and Instagram accounts for a fixed monthly rate. The length of the contract is one year and includes a bundle of services that correlate, such as monthly analytics reporting.</p> \n<p>This scenario is common, and a lot of agencies set their client relationships up with contracts.</p> \n<p>Contacted clients can be a good avenue for your agency if you want a set income and deep client relationships. Over time, your team will get to know the client and their needs as they evolve. This can lead to improved ROI.</p> \n<p>However, clients may be hesitant to sign a long-term contract. Make sure you show the client previous long-term successful campaigns to alleviate their worries. You can also introduce a trial run for a shorter amount of time.</p> \n<h3>Inbound Marketing</h3> \n<p>Agencies can make money from their marketing efforts. Of course, your agency most likely runs marketing campaigns for clients. However, there are ways to monetize marketing for <em>your</em> agency — for instance, if you run PPC ads on your website.</p> \n<p>Inbound marketing is one of the best ways to save money from branding your company. If you provide value for your target audience upfront, you won't have to waste time and resources cold calling and emailing. Additionally, your leads will be more valuable.</p> \n<p>When you run ads, consider looking for PPC options, so you can earn money with every click. Additionally, produce content, for example, ebooks and white papers, that promote your brand. This can be included in offers for prospective clients.</p> \n<h4>Referrals</h4> \n<p>You probably rely on referrals at some capacity for new clients. The referrals from happy customers give you quality contacts and new potential customers. Essentially, this form of word-of-mouth marketing helps you generate leads.</p> \n<p>Other than gaining more business, referrals help strengthen the relationship you have with clients. Ask them for their input on your offerings, and if they would recommend your company to a friend. That way, you're being proactive about lead generation.</p> \n<h2>4. Partnerships</h2> \n<p>Agencies can benefit from partnering with other organizations to generate revenue and leads. Think about influencers, clients, and other agencies in your industry that have potential to be in a campaign with your company.</p> \n<p>Partnerships are mutually beneficial relationships that earn both parties leads and generate revenue. Thought leaders are going to reach out to even if you don't secure a partnership; You can still expand your network and make new connections.</p> \n<h3>With Influencers</h3> \n<p>If your agency works with influencers, consider partnering with a few on a brand awareness campaign. They will be an advocate for your company, and maybe appear in a few ads or sponsored posts.</p> \n<p>As you're thinking about influencers with whom to partner, remember to choose one related closely to your industry if they're not a client. Those influencers will have audience members that are interested in content similar to yours, and have great potential to be quality leads.</p> \n<p>Check out this post from Twitch's Instagram, for example.

You can use their testimonials as part of a lead generation campaign. This is also a lower-cost alternative to the price of leveraging influencers.</p> \n<p>You can obtain the testimonial for free, and use the visual assets you created for the client as the content for the ad. For instance, take a look at this post from influencer agency Viral Nation:</p> \n<div> \n <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" style=\"background: #FFF; border: 0; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width: 540px; min-width: 326px; padding: 0; width: calc(100% - 2px);\"> \n  <div style=\"padding: 16px;\">\n   <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CAYSe7WjNUl/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\"background: #FFFFFF; line-height: 0; padding: 0 0; text-align: center; text-decoration: none; width: 100%;\"> \n    <div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center;\"> \n     <div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;\">\n      &nbsp;\n     </div> \n     <div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center;\"> \n      <div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;\">\n       &nbsp;\n      </div> \n      <div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 60px;\">\n       &nbsp;\n      </div> \n     </div> \n    </div> \n    <div style=\"padding: 19% 0;\">\n     &nbsp;\n    </div> \n    <div style=\"display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0 auto 12px; width: 50px;\">\n     &nbsp;\n    </div> \n    <div style=\"padding-top: 8px;\"> \n     <div style=\"color: #3897f0; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 550; line-height: 18px;\">\n      View this post on Instagram\n     </div> \n    </div> \n    <div style=\"padding: 12.5% 0;\">\n     &nbsp;\n    </div> \n    <div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; margin-bottom: 14px; align-items: center;\"> \n     <div> \n      <div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(0px) translateY(7px);\">\n       &nbsp;\n      </div> \n      <div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; height: 12.5px; transform: rotate(-45deg) translateX(3px) translateY(1px); width: 12.5px; flex-grow: 0; margin-right: 14px; margin-left: 2px;\">\n       &nbsp;\n      </div> \n      <div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(9px) translateY(-18px);\">\n       &nbsp;\n      </div> \n     </div> \n     <div style=\"margin-left: 8px;\"> \n      <div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 20px; width: 20px;\">\n       &nbsp;\n      </div> \n      <div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 2px solid transparent; border-left: 6px solid #f4f4f4; border-bottom: 2px solid transparent; transform: translateX(16px) translateY(-4px) rotate(30deg);\">\n       &nbsp;\n      </div> \n     </div> \n     <div style=\"margin-left: auto;\"> \n      <div style=\"width: 0px; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-right: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(16px);\">\n       &nbsp;\n      </div> \n      <div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; flex-grow: 0; height: 12px; width: 16px; transform: translateY(-4px);\">\n       &nbsp;\n      </div> \n      <div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-left: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(-4px) translateX(8px);\">\n       &nbsp;\n      </div> \n     </div> \n    </div> </a> \n   <p style=\"margin: 8px 0 0 0; padding: 0 4px;\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CAYSe7WjNUl/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\"color: #000; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none; word-wrap: break-word;\">Viral Nation has put together an influencer marketing campaign for @goldfishcanada to help drive brand awareness.

Ideally, this post will demonstrate the types of clients Viral Nation works with, so similar influencers will consider reaching out. This type of content is helpful for prospective agencies and influencers that are looking for campaign help and representation.</p> \n<p>Additionally, fans from the influencer, Priscilla Ventura, and agencies that follow Goldfish, could come across this post and decide to inquire about services.</p> \n<h3>With other agencies</h3> \n<p>Maybe you run an agency that focuses solely on social media. Your team conceptualizes, creates, and implements campaigns solely for social media. It works, and it's great.</p> \n<p>But you know your agency would benefit from offering a little more to clients. For that, consider partnering with an agency that offers services that complement social media — perhaps this is a website branding company.</p> \n<p>A partnership deal could include a bundled services offer: Clients can receive both services from each agency for a special price. This is a great way to obtain new leads and generate new business. Complementary agencies wouldn't be direct competition, and there's an advantage of tapping into their clientele.</p> \n<p>Sometimes, creative agencies are the unsung heroes behind your favorite campaign. It's always fun to look at which agencies produced a viral campaign. But in order to obtain the resources to create an effective campaign, you need revenue.</p> \n<p>For extra inspiration, check out what your favorite agencies are doing. How are they managing pricing models, and how are they using their social channels? Do you come across ads for that agency?</p> \n<p>Creative agencies can use a lot of the resources around them to pull in extra money. If you're part of an agency that is struggling to make ends meet, consider some of the out-of-the-box ideas, above, to either restructure your pricing model or increase revenue through partnerships or additional services.</p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fhow-creative-agencies-make-money&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 24 Jul 2020 08:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/how%20creative%20agencies%20make%20money.png","linkMd5":"6400251335e5c2ce389bec9d76ff49eb","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn61@2020_6/2020-07-30/1596118301648_a7dc117bf1ac020a.webp","author":"Kayla Carmicheal","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/how%20creative%20agencies%20make%20money.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn61@2020_6/2020-07-30/1596118301648_a7dc117bf1ac020a.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fhow-creative-agencies-make-money&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn53@2020_2/2020-07-30/1596118311008_660321b479f04939.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-07-30 22:11:40","updatedTime":"2020-07-30 14:11:40","title":"The Ultimate Guide to Google Analytics in 2020","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/google-analytics","description":"<p>Are you confused — even intimidated — by Google Analytics? Good news: you’re not alone. GA is notoriously complicated.</p>  \n<p>In fact, when I first started to delve into GA’s waters, I wondered if I’d ever truly <i>get </i>it. There were so many concepts to learn and reports to run. How did people ever conquer this thing?!?!</p> \n<p>Lots and <em>lots</em> of reading plus some trial and error, it turns out.</p> \n<p>I’m not saying I’ve reached total mastery — there’s always something new to pick up — but I’m vastly more comfortable.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>And I want you to be, too. So, here’s the cheat sheet to everything I’ve learned over the years. This guide might be long, but it’ll take you from zero to hero in ~6,000 words. And if you still have questions, let me know! I’m <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ajavuu?s=20\">@ajavuu</a> on Twitter.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>What is Google Analytics?</h2> \n<p><a href=\"https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/\">Google Analytics</a>, or GA, is an analytics tool that gives you an extremely in-depth look at your website and/or app performance. It integrates with <a href=\"https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/products/\">Google's marketing and advertising platforms and products</a> (including Google Ads, Search Console, and Data Studio) making it a popular choice for anyone using multiple Google tools.</p> \n<p>What other types of people is GA popular among?</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/analytics\">Other marketing analytics options, such as HubSpot</a>, can give you all the data you need with much less work. Oh, and here's another aspect of GA you'll want to take into consideration:</p> \n<h3>Is Google Analytics free?</h3> \n<p>There's a <a href=\"https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/compare/\">free and a paid version of GA</a> (the latter is called Analytics 360). Small and medium-sized businesses will likely get all the features you need from the free version. <a href=\"https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/contact-us/\">Enterprise businesses need to upgrade</a> if you want:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Advanced funnel reporting and attribution modeling</li> \n <li>Roll-up reporting</li> \n <li>More views, dimensions, and metrics per property</li> \n <li>Unlimited and unsampled data</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Paying for 360 also gives you access to dedicated support, including your own account manager. This alone can make the subscription fee worth it.</p> \n<p>And about that subscription fee? It’s not cheap. Analytics 360 <i>begins </i>at $150,000 per year (invoiced monthly) and increases after your site receives more than one billion monthly hits.</p> \n<p>360’s cost will price out many businesses. However, if you have the budget for both the service and an agency or in-house analyst to manage your analytics operations, consider investing.</p> \n<p>Now, what steps will you need to follow when setting up GA? Good question.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>How to Set Up Google Analytics</h2> \n<p>Before you start using Google Analytics, <a href=\"https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1102152?hl=en#:~:text=To%20use%20Analytics%2C%20you%20must,create%20your%20Google%20Account%20now.&amp;text=You%20can%20only%20access%20Analytics,valid%20Google%20Accounts%20email%20address.\">you'll have to set up a Google account</a>. This means you must have a registered Google Account email address and password.</p> \n<p>Once you've <a href=\"https://accounts.google.com/signup/v2/webcreateaccount?continue=https%3A%2F%2Faccounts.google.com%2FManageAccount%3Fnc%3D1&amp;flowName=GlifWebSignIn&amp;flowEntry=SignUp\">created a Google account</a>, that doesn't mean you automatically have access to GA — rather, you have to register for Analytics (which we'll review how to do in the <a href=\"#how-to-use-google-analytics\">next section</a>). But the important thing to note as you go to set up GA is that you can only access the tool by using a valid Google account.</p> \n<p>Additionally, to set up GA properly, you'll want to understand the various layers of the tool — specifically, the hierarchy.</p> \n<h4>Google Analytics Hierarchy</h4> \n<p>Here's a look at the GA hierarchy:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/image12-6.png?width=1500&amp;name=image12-6.png\" alt=\"google analytics hierarchy\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>Let's dive into each of the sections within the hierarchy.</p> \n<h5>1. Organization</h5> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/7645246?hl=en\">organization</a> is the highest level. It represents a company. For example, our organization is HubSpot, Inc. One organization can encompass multiple GA accounts.</p> \n<p>Organizations are recommended for larger businesses, but not mandatory.</p> \n<h5>2.Account(s)</h5> \n<p><a href=\"https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1102152?hl=en\">Accounts</a> are not optional. Using Google Analytics requires at least one (sometimes several) accounts.</p> \n<p>An account doesn’t mean a <i>user</i> account. I can log into the HubSpot Google Analytics accounts using my Google email ID. HubSpot’s head of technical SEO can also log into the same account using his Google email ID. Our historical optimization specialist can <i>also </i>log into the same account using <i>his </i>Google email ID.</p> \n<p>Important details:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>You can assign one property to each account or multiple properties to one account. Every account can hold up to <a href=\"https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1102152?hl=en\">50 properties</a>.</li> \n <li>You can give user permissions for an entire Analytics account, a property in an account, or a view in a property.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>You might be wondering, “What’s better: creating a new account for every property or adding every account to the same property?”</p> \n<p>It depends on your use case and goals.</p> \n<p>For example, suppose you have one website — the Stark Industries corporate site — and five subdirectories, including the Stark Industries blog, careers section, media resources, case studies, and investor relations information.</p> \n<p>You want to create separate properties for each subdirectory so the people on each team can look at how their portion of the site is performing, as well as the larger site.</p> \n<p>But maybe you have another site that discusses Tony Stark’s work with S.H.I.E.L.D. You want the S.H.I.E.L.D. team to see data for this subdirectory, but you don’t want them to see data for the rest of the website. You create a new account and property for the S.H.I.E.L.D. site.</p> \n<h5>Property</h5> \n<p>A <a href=\"https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/6090824?hl=en\">property</a> is a website or app. Each property can support up to 25 views.</p> \n<h5>View</h5> \n<p>At the minimum, you need two views per property:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>One with zero configuration — essentially the “raw” version of the view</li> \n <li>One with filters set up to exclude any traffic from within your company (i.e. a filter for your IP address) as well as bots and spam traffic</li> \n</ul> \n<p>A view only captures the information <strong>after </strong>your filters and configured settings have been applied. And once you delete a view, that data is gone forever. For those reasons, it’s critical to keep an unfiltered view of your data.</p> \n<p>Now that you have completed the basis for how how to set up GA, here are the steps involved in using the tool.</p> \n<a></a> \n<p>Here are the <a href=\"https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1008015?hl=en\">steps involved in using your GA account</a>.</p> \n<h3>1. Create a Google Analytics account.</h3> \n<p>First, you'll have to <a href=\"https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/\">create a Google Analytics account</a>. Or, sign in to your current account.</p> \n<h3>2. Add the name, URL, and industry of the website you want to track.</h3> \n<p><a href=\"https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1042508\">Choose which account</a> you want to add the <a href=\"https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1042508\">property</a> to. You should create and name your Property at this point and enter the website's URL as well as industry and reporting time zone. Then you'll be able to Create and Finish this step of the process.</p> \n<h3>3. Add a view to your property.</h3> \n<p>Go to the account and property you want to <a href=\"https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1009714\">add a view</a> to — use the menu to Create a View, name your view, select the type of view (web or app), and answer a few other questions. Remember, you can add up to <a href=\"https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6099198\">25 views to a property in GA</a>.</p> \n<h3>4. Add your tracking code directly after the &lt;head&gt; tag of your site.</h3> \n<p>When you <a href=\"https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1042508\">create a property</a>, you'll have access to a unique <a href=\"https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/7372977\">ID for tracking</a> and a global site tag (code you need to add to each site page you want to measure). This is how you'll be able to collect data in your property.</p> \n<p>Then, paste your global site tag right after the opening &lt;head&gt; tag on each site page you plan on measuring.</p> \n<p>You'll be asked to choose your type of site (static, dynamic, web hosting, Google Tag Manager) so that you can set up the data collection accurately.</p> \n<p>(For more, read our <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-install-google-analytics-tracking-code-website-ht?_ga=2.264748431.1638437897.1554681579-1350116256.1554681579\">guide to installing the Google Analytics tracking code on your site</a>.)</p> \n<h3>5. Visit your GA portal and verify the code is working.</h3> \n<p>Lastly, <a href=\"https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1008080\">verify your code is working</a>. You can do this by looking at the <a href=\"https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1638635\">Real-Time reports</a> section while clicking around on your site in a different tab or on your phone. The report should show at least one visitor to the site (that’s you!)</p> \n<p>And that's pretty much it! After that review, you may be wondering the following:</p> \n<h4>Do you need to add the GA code to every page of your site?</h4> \n<p>That’s a lot of manual work — especially if your website has more than 50 pages. Plus, what happens when you create new pages? Do you need to add the tag every time?!</p> \n<p>Relax, because the short answer is: <em>no</em>.</p> \n<p>The longer answer: you only need to add the tag to every page template. So, if you have one page type on your site (meaning every individual page uses the same header module), you only need to add it to that module — and it’ll be applied to every page.</p> \n<p>If you have two page types, you’d need to paste the code into the two separate header modules. Three page types? Three header modules.</p> \n<p>And if you use a <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/cms\">CMS like HubSpot</a>, this task is even easier. These tools come with a separate field where you paste your tracking code just once. <a href=\"https://knowledge.hubspot.com/articles/kcs_article/cos-general/how-do-i-put-my-google-analytics-code-onto-my-new-landing-pages?_ga=2.100588702.1638437897.1554681579-1350116256.1554681579\">HubSpot users can follow these simple instructions for adding GA</a>.</p> \n<p>Additionally, to use GA successfully, you need to understand <a href=\"https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1033861?hl=en\">dimensions versus metrics</a>.</p> \n<h4>Google Analytics Dimensions and Metrics</h4> \n<p>I’ve found the easiest way to think about it is:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Dimensions = categorical variables. Simple examples include names, colors, and places.</li> \n <li>Metrics = quantitative variables. Basic examples include age, temperature, and population.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Or as my Data Analytics professor put it, \"Metrics are what you can do math on.” Not the most eloquent phrasing, but it works.</p> \n<h5>Dimension Examples</h5> \n<ol> \n <li>Browser</li> \n <li>Location</li> \n <li>Landing page</li> \n <li>Device</li> \n <li>Customer type</li> \n</ol> \n<h5>Metric Examples</h5> \n<ol> \n <li>Sessions</li> \n <li>Pageviews</li> \n <li>Conversions</li> \n <li>Bounce rate</li> \n <li>Session duration</li> \n</ol> \n<p>In any GA report, your dimensions are your rows and your metrics are your columns.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/image6-10.png?width=1500&amp;name=image6-10.png\" alt=\"google analytics metrics\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<h4>Custom Dimensions and Metrics</h4> \n<p>GA lets you create <a href=\"https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2709828?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=2709827\">custom dimensions and metrics </a>from Analytics data plus non-Analytics data. To give you an idea, suppose you track the membership type of customers who have created an account in your CRM. You could combine this information with page views to see page views by member type.</p> \n<p>Or maybe you run a blog. If you want to understand how audience engagement impacts other metrics (like conversions, pages per session, etc.), you could create three custom dimensions for each type of reader:</p> \n<ol> \n <li><strong>Advocate</strong>: user who shared one-plus posts on social media</li> \n <li><strong>Subscriber</strong>: user who signed up for your email list</li> \n <li><strong>Customer</strong>: user who purchased premium access</li> \n</ol> \n<p>Using these dimensions will give you invaluable information.</p> \n<h4>What’s a Google Analytics audience?</h4> \n<p>An <a href=\"https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2611404?hl=en\">audience</a> is a group of users that have something in common. That commonality could be anything: maybe you’re targeting consumers in Australia, so you have an \"Australian audience,” or you want to sell to millennials, so you have a \"25-34 audience.”</p> \n<p>GA comes with several built-in audiences (including the two I just mentioned, location and age). You don’t need to do a thing to set these up — once you have the tracking code installed, GA will automatically break down your visitor data into these audience reports.</p> \n<p>However, you can also create custom audiences. Perhaps you’re only interested in \"Australian millennials\"; you’d need to make a custom audience that only includes visitors who are A) in Australia and B) between the ages of 25 and 34.</p> \n<p>Creating an audience is fairly easy. Honestly, the hardest part is figuring out what you’re trying to accomplish and then identifying the user characteristics that’ll help you do that.</p> \n<p>Once you’ve done that, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-create-custom-audience-segments-in-google-analytics-quick-tip?_ga=2.264748431.1638437897.1554681579-1350116256.1554681579\">follow these instructions to create a new audience segment</a>. From there you can <a href=\"https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2611404?hl=en\">import a segment to use as the basis for your Audience Report</a>.</p> \n<p>That brings us to the next question:</p> \n<h4>What’s a Google Analytics segment?</h4> \n<p>A <a href=\"https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/3123951?hl=en\">segment</a> is a subset of your data. I like to picture an entire pizza made up of all different slices — one slice has pesto and mozzarella, another has sausages and spicy peppers, another has ham and pineapple, and so on. Metaphorically speaking, each slice is a segment.</p> \n<p>You can create segments based on:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Users</strong> (e.g. users who have bought something on your site before, users who have signed up for a consultation, etc.)</li> \n <li><strong>Sessions</strong> (e.g. all sessions that were generated from a specific marketing campaign, all sessions where a pricing page was viewed)</li> \n <li><strong>Hits</strong> (e.g. all hits where the purchase exceeded $85, all hits where a specific product was added to the cart)</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Like audiences, GA provides you with several segments. I wouldn’t stop there: you can get incredibly granular with your segments.</p> \n<p>To give you some inspiration, here are a few of HubSpot’s segments:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Users who viewed a specific product page and watched the demo video</li> \n <li>Users who viewed the same product page and <i>didn’t </i>watch the demo video</li> \n <li>Users who view a specific Academy course page</li> \n <li>Users who view a specific Academy lesson page</li> \n <li>Users who view a blog post <i>and </i>a product page</li> \n</ul> \n<p>The sky is your limit — well, that, and <a href=\"https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/3123951?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=3123779\">GA’s segment cap</a>.</p> \n<a></a> \n<p>Alright, now let's look at GA Reports. Remember, you can apply up to four segments at a time to any report.</p> \n<h2>Google Analytics Reports</h2> \n<p>GA’s left-hand sidebar can be a bit overwhelming. You’ve got six reporting options (all with confusing, vague names), and clicking on any of those only gives you <i>more </i>options.</p> \n<p>Let’s walk through each report together.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/image16-1.png?width=400&amp;name=image16-1.png\" alt=\"google analytics reports\" width=\"400\" style=\"width: 400px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<h3>Google Analytics Real-Time Report</h3> \n<p>As the name suggests, the <a href=\"https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1638635?hl=en\">Real-Time report</a> gives you insight into what’s happening on your site at this very moment. You can see how many visitors are on your site, which pages they’re visiting, which social platforms they’re coming from, where they’re located, and more.</p> \n<p>While this report is fun to look at occasionally, it’s probably the least valuable. Here are some ways to use Real-Time:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>See how much traffic you’re getting from a new social or blog post</li> \n <li>Know immediately if a one-day sale or event is driving views and/or conversions</li> \n <li>Make sure tracking URLs and custom events that you’ve just set up are working as they should</li> \n</ul> \n<p>These are useful, but as you’ll see, the other reports pack a far greater punch.</p> \n<h3>Google Analytics Audience Report</h3> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/7162572?hl=en\">GA Audience report</a> gives you a high-level overview for the property you’re currently looking at. Check this report once a day to get a sense of how you’re trending overall.</p> \n<p>Underneath \"Overview,\" you’ll see \"Audiences,” as well as expandable menus for \"Demographics,” \"Interests,” \"Geo,” \"Behavior,” \"Technology,” \"Mobile,” \"Cross-Device,” \"Custom,” and \"Benchmarking.”</p> \n<h4><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/image15.png?width=400&amp;name=image15.png\" alt=\"google analytics audience report\" width=\"400\" style=\"width: 400px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></h4> \n<p>Explore each of these sections to get a sense of what they can tell you about your visitors.</p> \n<p>Every section describes an audience.</p> \n<h4>Active Users</h4> \n<p>Whoever named this report belongs in the same group as the person who named guinea pigs: \"active users” doesn’t refer to users currently on your site — that’s the Real-Time report — and <a href=\"https://www.rd.com/culture/misnomers/\">guinea pigs are neither pigs nor from Guinea</a>.</p> \n<p>The Active Users report shows you the number of users who visited in the last day (1-day active users), week (7-day active users), two weeks (14-day active users), and four weeks (28-day active users.)</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/image14-2.png?width=1500&amp;name=image14-2.png\" alt=\"google analytics active users report\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>What’s the value of this report, you ask?</p> \n<p>If you have more one-day users than longer-term ones, you’re struggling with retention. People aren’t coming back to your site or app — you need to figure out why.</p> \n<p>I’d also recommend looking at this report with various segments; for instance, perhaps you see that users in a certain age bracket have much better retention than the average.</p> \n<h4>Lifetime Value</h4> \n<p>First things first: do you need a refresher on Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) and how to calculate it? <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service/how-to-calculate-customer-lifetime-value?_ga=2.264748431.1638437897.1554681579-1350116256.1554681579\">We’ve got you.</a></p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6182550?hl=en\">Lifetime Value report</a> gives you a sense of how valuable users are to your company. You can see lifetime value for, say, the users you generated from email marketing versus the ones you acquired from organic search. Armed with this information, you can decide which channel to invest more in.</p> \n<p>A few notes: Lifetime Value is capped at 90 days. The Acquisition date range, however — which you can adjust — reflects all the users you acquired in that time frame.</p> \n<p>Imagine you’re interested in looking at transactions per user for users you acquired in the week before Black Friday. You’d adjust the date range to that week specifically. Then you’d see the average transactions per user for that cohort over the following 90 days.</p> \n<p>Because HubSpot is a SaaS company, not an ecommerce business, I look at goal completions per user, page views per user, and sessions per user by Acquisition Channel.</p> \n<p>If my team has recently wrapped up a marketing campaign, I’ll look at the same metrics by Acquisition <i>Campaign</i>.</p> \n<p>But if you are in ecommerce and want to see transaction and revenue data, you’ll need to have <a href=\"https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1037249?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=1037061\">ecommerce tracking set up</a>.</p> \n<p>(By the way, here’s <a href=\"https://knowledge.hubspot.com/articles/kcs_article/reports/how-do-i-report-on-revenue-in-hubspot?_ga=2.34013089.1638437897.1554681579-1350116256.1554681579\">how to track revenue in HubSpot</a>.)</p> \n<h4>Cohort Analysis</h4> \n<p>Some people have gone so far as to call <a href=\"https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6074676?hl=en\">Cohort Analysis</a> <a href=\"https://medium.com/the-data-dynasty/the-single-most-overlooked-report-in-google-analytics-yet-most-powerful-6ec90eba243a\">\"the single most powerful report in GA.”</a></p> \n<p>So, how does it work? This report groups users by one characteristic — so far, \"Acquisition Date” is the only “Cohort Type” you can use. By the way, Acquisition Date is the day a user first visited your website.</p> \n<p>You have several options from there.</p> \n<ol> \n <li>First, pick your <strong>cohort size</strong>: day, week, or month.</li> \n <li>Next, pick your <strong>metric</strong>, or what you want to explore for this cohort. It can be further broken down into Per user, Retention, and Total.</li> \n <ul> \n  <li><strong>Per user </strong>means the total count of that metric divided by the cohort size. So if you choose Transactions per user, for example, you’ll see the average number of transactions per user for that cohort.</li> \n  <li><strong>Retention</strong> is simple: user retention, or the number of users who returned that day, week or month (determined by the cohort size you selected) divided by the total number of users in that cohort.</li> \n  <li><strong>Total</strong>: the total number of sessions, transactions, etc. that occurred for that cohort size.</li> \n </ul> \n <li>Choose your <strong>date range</strong>. GA lets you see up to three months of data.</li> \n</ol> \n<p>Now let’s dive into <i>reading </i>the report, because it’s not obvious.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/image13.png?width=1500&amp;name=image13.png\" alt=\"google analytics cohort report\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>The left-hand column shows you the Cohort Type you picked — Acquisition date, by default — broken down by Cohort Size (day, week, or month).</p> \n<p>The first row shows you the totals for all the users in that cohort. Each row underneath that represents the activity in that day, week, or month (in this example, we’re looking at month.)</p> \n<p>The row outlined in light blue reflects the Cohort Size you’ve chosen. Remember that data only goes back three months at the max.</p> \n<p>The row outlined in yellow shows you the values for the metric you chose (in this case, Goal Completions per User). In the eternal words of Calvin Harris: baby, this what you came for.</p> \n<p>Look at the first row. This tells you the average goal completions for the entire cohort in the first month after they were acquired was 1.09. Average goal completions for the entire cohort in the second month after they acquired dropped to 0.09. By the last month, it’s 0.02.</p> \n<p>Now look at the next three rows. It looks like average goal completions per user in the first month after they were acquired increased slightly from December to January and again from January to February.</p> \n<p>This is pretty usual behavior. Let’s imagine that instead, this report tells us average goal completions per user for February 1-28, 2019 (the last row) was 4.07. Woah! That’s nearly four times as high as December and January.</p> \n<p>We’d definitely want to investigate further. And to do so, all we have to do is right-click on the cohort we’re interested in.</p> \n<p>Make sure you click on the column if you want the entire day, week, or month analyzed. Click on a cell if you want to analyze only the users who, for example, completed a goal three days after they were acquired on February 27, 2019.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/image3-15.png?width=1500&amp;name=image3-15.png\" alt=\"google analytics cohort report\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>When you right-click, this box will pop up:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/image10-8.png?width=1500&amp;name=image10-8.png\" alt=\"google analytics cohort segment\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>Give this cohort a descriptive name. Change the views to \"Any View” if you want to use this segment across your entire property (which I usually recommend), then click \"Create.”</p> \n<p>Voila — now you can compare this cohort to any other segment in any report you choose.</p> \n<h3>Google Analytics Acquisition Reports</h3> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/3157419?hl=en\">Acquisition report</a> breaks down your traffic by source: organic, direct, referral, email, social, paid search, display, affiliate, and (Other). (<a href=\"https://www.wholewhale.com/tips/other-traffic-google-analytics/\">GA uses the (Other) category</a> when it doesn’t know how to categorize a subset of traffic.)</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/image8-10.png?width=400&amp;name=image8-10.png\" alt=\"google analytics acquisition report\" width=\"400\" style=\"width: 400px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>From All Traffic, you can click into Channels.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/image17.png?width=1500&amp;name=image17.png\" alt=\"google analytics acquisition by channel\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>Click on any category to explore each source in detail.</p> \n<p>Depending on the category, you’ll see <strong>landing pages</strong> (which URLs your visitors entered the site on), <strong>source</strong> (which website brought them to yours), or <strong>keyword</strong> (which query took them to your site.)</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/image1-29.png?width=400&amp;name=image1-29.png\" alt=\"google analytics acquisition report\" width=\"400\" style=\"width: 400px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>To see this information presented visually, click on All Traffic &gt; <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Treemaps</span>. This post walks you through <a href=\"https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6180144?hl=en\">how to read and adjust the Treemaps report</a>.</p> \n<p>The next report, <strong>Source/Medium</strong>, breaks down the general category of traffic (which you saw in “Channels”) into the search engine or domain.</p> \n<p>It’s useful if you want to get more granular insight into the ways people are coming to your site. For example, you might notice that a whopping 70% of your referral traffic is coming from LinkedIn, while just 5% is coming from Pinterest. Depending on your marketing team’s priorities it may be time to shift focus.</p> \n<p>The last report, <strong>Referrals</strong>, reveals the specific URLs that sent people to your site, e.g. your referral traffic.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/image24.png?width=1500&amp;name=image24.png\" alt=\"google analytics acquisition by landing page\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>I like to add \"Landing page” as a secondary dimension so you can see which pages on your site are receiving the referral traffic.</p> \n<h3>Google Analytics Behavior Reports</h3> \n<p>Out of all the reports in GA, I use the <a href=\"https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/7126596?hl=en\">Behavior</a> ones the most.</p> \n<h4>Site Content</h4> \n<p>This report gives you a review all of the blog posts, landing pages, web pages on your site.</p> \n<h5>All Pages</h5> \n<p>Let’s start with Site Content &gt; All Pages. This shows the top-trafficked pages for your current view and/or segment. It’s useful in and of itself — you should always keep a careful eye on your most viewed URLs — but I especially like it when I’m analyzing traffic growth or declines.</p> \n<p>To give you an idea, maybe total traffic to my website has dropped 10% month over month. I’d navigate to Site Content &gt; All Pages and change the date range to this month compared to the last month (making sure the days of the week match up).</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/image5-15.png?width=1500&amp;name=image5-15.png\" alt=\"google analytics site content\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>Then I can see the differences in page views by URL:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/image20-1.png?width=1500&amp;name=image20-1.png\" alt=\"google analytics page views\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>This helps me identify which pages received less traffic and contributed to that decline.</p> \n<p><strong>Helpful tip: </strong>I like to change the \"Sort Type” from \"Default” to \"Absolute Change” so I see the results sorted by the greatest differences in percentage rather than total views.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/image7-6.png?width=1500&amp;name=image7-6.png\" alt=\"google analytics\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>I also add Page Title as a secondary dimension so I can see the name of each page alongside its URL.</p> \n<h5>Content Drilldown</h5> \n<p>This report breaks down the structure of your site by subdomain and then subfolder. To give you an idea, for HubSpot we can see data for each of our subdomains, including:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>blog.hubspot.com</li> \n <li>developers.hubspot.com</li> \n <li>community.hubspot.com</li> \n</ul> \n<p>And so on. If I clicked into blog.hubspot.com, I could then see aggregated data for:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>blog.hubspot.com/sales</li> \n <li>blog.hubspot.com/marketing</li> \n <li>blog.hubspot.com/service</li> \n</ul> \n<p>You get the drift. This report is probably most valuable for those managing highly complex properties.</p> \n<h5>Landing Pages</h5> \n<p>Landing pages is another one of my favorite reports. GA defines a landing page as the first page in a session — in other words, the visitor’s first interaction with your website.</p> \n<p>There are a few ways to slice and dice this report.</p> \n<p>First, if you’re interested in the sources (organic, paid social, direct, etc.) driving users to the landing page, you can add Source/Medium as a secondary dimension.</p> \n<p>This is basically the opposite version of the report we added earlier.</p> \n<p>Second, if you only want to see which landing pages users visited from a specific source, on a specific platform, or within a specific category, you can add the appropriate system segment:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/image9-5.png?width=1500&amp;name=image9-5.png\" alt=\"google analytics landing pages\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>Maybe you’re most interested in the landing pages that mobile and tablet users see — so you choose the Mobile and Tablet Traffic.</p> \n<p>Or perhaps you’re curious about users who ended up buying something, so you choose the \"Made a Purchase” segment. There are lots of possibilities here.</p> \n<h5>Exit Pages</h5> \n<p>This report shows the last pages users visited in their sessions before they left your site.</p> \n<p>That’s a little confusing, so let’s use an example.</p> \n<p>I want to find a place to grab dinner with my friends so I search, \"Mediterranean restaurants near me.” A place that looks good pops up, so I click on it. First, I check out the menu. They have a hummus sampler — yum. Then I click on their press page. It links to a recent article on Eater, so I leave the site to read it. The reviewer loved the food. I’m sold.</p> \n<p>The Press page would be my exit page.</p> \n<p>You may hear that you should analyze your exit pages to understand why users are leaving your site — I think this example reveals why that strategy doesn’t always make sense. Just because someone has left doesn’t mean anything is wrong with the content.</p> \n<p>Check this report out but take the data with a grain of salt.</p> \n<h4>Site Speed</h4> \n<p>This report is pretty self-explanatory: it tells you how quickly your site is loading for users. Obviously, the faster the better — not only do <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/page-load-time-conversion-rates?_ga=2.34013089.1638437897.1554681579-1350116256.1554681579\">faster pages correlate with higher revenue</a>, but <a href=\"https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2018/01/using-page-speed-in-mobile-search.html\">Google’s algorithm takes page load time into account</a>.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/image21.jpg?width=1500&amp;name=image21.jpg\" alt=\"google analytics site speed\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<h5>Site Speed Page Timings</h5> \n<p>This report delves into the average page load times for each URL. I use it to identify the slowest-loading pages on HubSpot’s site with the ultimate goal of figuring out why they’re taking their sweet, sweet time and how to speed them up.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/image20-1.png?width=1500&amp;name=image20-1.png\" alt=\"google analytics site speed\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>The default metrics are page views and average page load time, but I also recommend looking at:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Avg. page load time and bounce rate</li> \n <ul> \n  <li>Change the Sort Type to “Weighted” so you see the blog posts with the highest page views first</li> \n </ul> \n <li>Avg. page load time and page value</li> \n <ul> \n  <li>The latter gives you a sense of <a href=\"https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2695658?hl=en\">how much a specific page contributes to your total revenue</a></li> \n  <li>Looking at these two together helps you find slow-loading pages that are valuable to your bottom line (even if they don’t get a ton of traffic), making them a high priority to fix</li> \n </ul> \n</ul> \n<h4>Site Search</h4> \n<p>First things first: if users can search your website, make sure you’ve set up Site Search in GA. You must enable it for every view separately (here are <a href=\"https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1012264?hl=en\">the step-by-step instructions</a>).</p> \n<h5>Usage</h5> \n<p>I typically start with the \"Usage” report, which tells me how many sessions occurred with and without one-plus searches. In other words, I learn how frequently people used site search for the view and time period I specified.</p> \n<h5>Search Terms</h5> \n<p>Here’s where you learn what people are searching for. Look for themes: if you see the same search terms coming up multiple times, there are a few conclusions you could draw.</p> \n<p>Either you need to create new content that gives users the information they’re looking for, and/or you need to better surface existing content so it’s easier to find.</p> \n<p>Pay attention to the \"% Search Exits” column, as this tells you how many users clicked away from the search results page rather than choosing a result. You can usually infer there wasn’t a good answer for their question (or it wasn’t appropriately titled.)</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/image22.png?width=1500&amp;name=image22.png\" alt=\"google analytics search terms\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<h5>Search Pages</h5> \n<p>This report displays which pages users are starting searches from. It’s important to think about this contextually. Maybe people are commonly beginning searches from your 404 page — that makes sense and isn’t anything to be alarmed about.</p> \n<p>If, on the other hand, they’re starting searches from a product landing page, something’s wrong. The content clearly isn’t living up to the expectations they had when they clicked the ad link.</p> \n<p>Loves Data provides a <a href=\"https://www.lovesdata.com/blog/site-search-reports\">solid overview of GA’s Site Search reports</a> if you want to explore them even further.</p> \n<h4>Events</h4> \n<p>A user clicks a button. Then they download a file. Next they watch a video.</p> \n<p>No, this isn’t the world’s most boring bedtime story — it’s an example of a GA event. Three events, to be specific.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1033068?hl=en\">GA defines events as,</a> \"user interactions with content that can be measured independently from a web page or a screen load.”</p> \n<p>Those user interactions are up to you; you’ll need to add special code to your site or app that tracks the specific actions you’re interested in. Here are <a href=\"https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1136960\">the instructions</a>.</p> \n<p>If you’re not excited about events tracking already, I want you to get excited. There are infinite possibilities here: if you have an event set up for watching a product demo, and another for clicking a link to an external review of your tool, you can measure how many times each event happened.</p> \n<p>Maybe you discover your video isn’t getting many plays. It’s probably time to optimize the current video, make it easier to find on your site, or create a new one. Or perhaps you see that way more users than you expected are checking out the third-party review of your product.</p> \n<p>That tells you users want more social proof and testimonials. Since the review is favorable, you might want to put it front and center on your site.</p> \n<h5>Top Events</h5> \n<p>This report tracks the events taking place most frequently — pretty straightforward. You’ll see total events (e.g. how many times that event happened) and unique events (how many sessions included one or more occurrences of that event).</p> \n<p>If you’ve set values for your events, this report also shows you how the total value of each event and its average value (or the total value divided by the frequency.)</p> \n<h5>Pages</h5> \n<p>In this report, you can see which pages generate the most actions. I typically add \"Event Category” as the secondary dimension, then filter for the event I’m most interested in.</p> \n<p>To give you an idea, my team tracks \"Blog CTA.” This event fires whenever a user clicks a CTA embedded in a blog post. To get to the report below, I added \"Event Category” as the second dimension, then filtered for \"Page begins with blog.hubspot.com” (so I’d only see URLs on the blog) and \"Event Category equals Blog CTA.”</p> \n<p>Now I can see which posts generate the most CTA clicks. Hopefully you’re starting to see the power of event tracking!</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/image18.png?width=1500&amp;name=image18.png\" alt=\"google analytics page\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<h5>Events Flow</h5> \n<p>The Events Flow report tracks the order in which events take place on your site. It can tell you:</p> \n<p>A) Whether particular events tend to happen first — and if they trigger other events</p> \n<p>To give you an idea, maybe users frequently watch your demo video, then click the CTA to schedule a call with a salesperson.</p> \n<p>B) Whether certain event categories are more common than others</p> \n<p>Imagine you see that videos are played far more often than PDFs are downloaded.</p> \n<p>C) Whether users act differently based on segment</p> \n<p>For example, perhaps people coming in via organic scroll to the bottom of your pricing page far more than people coming in via social media.</p> \n<p>Note: This report is very subject to sampling.

Sampled data is usually pretty accurate, but it means the more important the conclusion you’re drawing, the less uncertainty you’ll be able to tolerate.</p> \n<p>To reduce the level of sampling, make the date range smaller.</p> \n<h4>Publisher</h4> \n<p>If you monetize your website with Google AdSense or Ad Exchange, you can use the Ad Manager and Google Analytics integration to bring information on how your ad units are performing into GA.</p> \n<p>I won’t go into any more detail here, but I recommend reading the following resources if you want to know more:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6183286?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=6183302\">About the Google Ad Manager integration</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6183304?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=6183302\">Set up the Google Ad Manager integration</a></li> \n</ul> \n<h3>Google Analytics Conversion Reports</h3> \n<p>If you have a website, you have an objective — probably several — for the people who visit your site.</p> \n<p>Ecommerce store owners want their visitors to subscribe to their mailing list, make a user account, add something to their cart, and/or complete the order confirmation process.</p> \n<p>Media companies want their visitors to stay on their site for as long as possible and/or view a certain number of pages (all the better to maximize their ad revenue.)</p> \n<p>B2B businesses want their visitors to download an ebook, sign up for a webinar, or book a call with a sales rep.</p> \n<p>Google Analytics makes it possible to measure all of these things — plus many more.</p> \n<p>A goal is essentially a conversion that you’ve defined (which is why this info shows up under the Conversion section.)</p> \n<p>There are four main types of goals:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Destination: </strong>This goal is completed when a user reaches a specific page, like a product page, order confirmation page, or thank you page</li> \n</ul> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Event: </strong>This goal is completed when a predefined event fires (like the Events you can set up as, well, Events — think watching a video or sharing something to social media)</li> \n</ul> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Duration: </strong>This goal is completed when a user’s session lasts longer than a pre-set time</li> \n</ul> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Pages/screens per session: </strong>This goal is completed when a user views a specific number of pages (or screens for an app) per session</li> \n</ul> \n<p>The first two are insanely useful. The last two are pretty useless. (If you have an interesting use case for Duration or Pages/screens per session, let me know on Twitter @ajavuu. I’d love to be proven wrong.)</p> \n<p>Once you’ve identified your goals, take a look at these instructions for <a href=\"https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1032415?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=6150889\">creating, editing, and sharing</a> them. This guide on <a href=\"https://www.jeffalytics.com/google-analytics-goal-value/\">choosing goal values</a> is also quite helpful.</p> \n<h4>Overview</h4> \n<p>Head here to learn how you’re doing goal-wise across the board. I get the most from this report when I compare date ranges and/or look at goal completions by segment.</p> \n<p>For example, quickly looking at goal completions by device reveals mobile visitors sign up for the blog newsletter much less frequently than desktop and tablet visitors. That could be because it’s hard to sign up for the newsletter on a phone — or it could be mobile users are looking for one thing and ending their session as soon as they’ve found it. I should dig in more to decide which case it is.</p> \n<h4>Goal URLs</h4> \n<p>Knowing a goal was completed isn’t helpful in and of itself; you also need to know <i>where </i>it happened. Suppose you’ve embedded the same form in three separate pages on your site.</p> \n<p>It’s great that Daenerys Stark from Dragonstone, Blackwater Bay just filled out your form to get in touch with a consultant, but which page did she fill it out on?</p> \n<p>The Goal URLs report shows you. It breaks down conversions by \"Goal Completion URL” (read: where it went down.)</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/image2-40.png?width=1500&amp;name=image2-40.png\" alt=\"google analytics goals\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<h4>Reverse Goal Path</h4> \n<p>Reverse Goal Path is the unsung hero of the Conversion section. Well, I’m singing its praises now. This report allows you to see the last three pages a user visited before completing the goal.</p> \n<p>It’s useful for goals that aren’t sequential. Maybe you have a contact form that appears in multiple places on your site, or there are two different paths that lead users into buying your ebook. Thanks to this report, you can understand the various ways people arrive at the end destination — and there’s no need to set up a funnel.</p> \n<p>I usually filter down to a specific goal completion location or goal previous step 1, 2, or 3.</p> \n<p>For example, since I’m interested in seeing which blog posts generated leads from content downloads, I added \"Goal Previous Step - 1 containing blog.hubspot.com” to the filter.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/image11-8.png?width=1500&amp;name=image11-8.png\" alt=\"google analytics reverse goal path\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>Here’s what I got:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/image4-12.png?width=1500&amp;name=image4-12.png\" alt=\"google analytics reverse goal path\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>\"(Entrance)” means the user came to the site on that step; \"(not set)” means the user didn’t complete any steps prior to that one — because they weren’t on the website yet.</p> \n<p>For a comprehensive exploration of Reverse Goal Path, take a look at <a href=\"https://online-metrics.com/reverse-goal-path-report/\">OnlineMetrics’s guide</a>.</p> \n<h4>Funnel Visualization</h4> \n<p>For sequential goals, Funnel Visualization is your go-to report.</p> \n<p>Going back to the ecommerce example, the last goal would be \"Arrived at the order confirmation page.” The goal before that, or goal #3, would be \"Clicked checkout.” The goal before that, goal #2, would be \"Added something to cart.” And the goal before <i>that</i>, goal #1, would be \"Looked at product listing page.”</p> \n<p>At each stage, you can see user drop-off. That lets you identify areas where you can improve conversion rates; for example, maybe you lose a lot of users during the checkout process. You change the flow so they can check out as a guest (versus needing to create an account), which dramatically reduces checkout abandonment.</p> \n<p>To see this level of detail, you’ll need to map out your goals as a series. If all of your goals are simply the end objective, like \"Arrived at the order confirmation page,” you won’t be able to reverse-engineer how users progress.</p> \n<p>The Funnel Visualization report also requires you to mark the first step in the goal path as required or not. If you tell GA that yes, the first goal <i>needs </i>to be completed, Funnel Visualization will only show you the sessions where the user first finished goal #1. If a user skips goal #1 and goes straight to goal #2, their session won’t be represented here.</p> \n<h4>Goal Flow</h4> \n<p>If Funnel Visualization is the uptight relative who always made you take your elbows off the table and wash your hands before you ate, Goal Flow is the laid-back, fun relative who’d randomly take you out of school to go to the zoo.</p> \n<p>All that to say: Goal Flow gives you a lot more freedom than Funnel Visualization. Unlike the latter, Goal Flow shows you all sessions that led to the completed end goal — regardless of whether the user completed the required goal #1 or not.</p> \n<p>Another difference from Funnel Visualization: Goal Flow also shows you loopbacks — i.e. when a user goes back to a previous page or refreshes their current one.</p> \n<p>If the user skips a step, Funnel Visualization \"backfils” it. Goal Flow doesn’t.</p> \n<p>If you edit an existing funnel or create a new one, Funnel Visualization will show you all your data from that moment onward. Goal Flow, on the other hand, can show you data from the past.</p> \n<p>You can also toggle the Dimension and Level of detail of the report, as well as the segment, to get even more granular.</p> \n<p>I recommend looking at various segments to see which convert at the highest and lowest rates — plus where they commonly drop out.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/image19.png?width=1500&amp;name=image19.png\" alt=\"google analytics goal flow\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>Note: This report is subject to sampling. (Read more about <a href=\"https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2637192?hl=en&amp;utm_id=ad&amp;visit_id=636892309605632354-846865128&amp;rd=1\">GA’s data sampling practices here</a>.) Sampled data is usually pretty accurate, but it means the more important the conclusion you’re drawing, the less uncertainty you’ll be able to tolerate.</p> \n<p>To reduce the level of sampling, make the date range smaller.</p> \n<h4>Smart Goals</h4> \n<p>This report is helpful if you’re A) using Google Ads and B) <i>not </i>measuring conversions. Basically, Google uses machine learning to identify your \"best” sessions — or those likeliest to generate conversions — and then translates those themes into Smart Goals.</p> \n<p>Once you have Smart Goals, you can use them in <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/google-adwords-ppc\">Google Ads</a> to optimize your ads performance.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.bounteous.com/insights/2017/05/23/google-analytics-adwords-smart-goals/\">Smart Goals are controversial</a> within the marketing community because the data is minimal and businesses will be far better served by setting up their own conversion tracking. Keep that in mind if you decide to use them.</p> \n<h2>Now You’re Ready to Track</h2> \n<p>Google Analytics is a highly valuable tool for any business as it gives you tangible data that you can apply to grow your business.

Tip]","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-optimize-urls-for-search","description":"<p>Organic search is the most consistent, long-term way to drive traffic to your website — if you can perform well on the SERPs (Search Engine Results Pages). While many SEO factors are out of your control, such as who you're competing with and what they're doing, you can still benefit from <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33655/a-step-by-step-guide-to-flawless-on-page-seo-free-template.aspx\">on-page optimization</a>, which is very much in your control.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>One on-page best practice is optimizing your URL slug for each page and post you create. It's one of those <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/google-algorithm-visual-history-infographic\">SEO best practices that's actually stood the test of time</a>, left relatively unscathed by violent little penguins and fuzzy-yet-aggressive pandas.</p>  \n<p></p> \n<div class=\"hsg-featured-snippet\"> \n <h2>What Is a URL Slug?</h2> \n <p>A slug refers to the part of the URL that identifies the address of the individual page. The slug is located at the end of the URL after the domain and any subdirectories.</p> \n</div> \n<p>Let's use a physical address as an analogy. If your website was a complex filled with offices, your domain is the address where the \"complex\" can be found. The slug, then, would be a box number or suite number that corresponds to a specific place in that complex.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Just as that box or suite number directs people to the correct office in the complex, a URL slug directs your browser to the correct page on your site, differentiating it from all the others on your domain.</p> \n<h3>URL Slug Example</h3> \n<p>Let's take our URL for this post:</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-optimize-urls-for-search</em></p> \n<p>Here are the elements of this URL:&nbsp;</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Protocol:</strong> https</li> \n <li><strong>Subdomain:</strong> blog.</li> \n <li><strong>Domain:</strong> hubspot.com</li> \n <li><strong>Subdirectory:</strong> marketing</li> \n <li><strong>URL Slug:</strong> how-to-optimize-urls-for-search</li> \n</ul> \n<p>At minimum, a URL is composed of the protocol and the domain. Other elements are added depending on the page and where it is within your site's structure.</p> \n<p>In this example, it's really clear from the subdomain and subdirectory where you are — you're on HubSpot's blog in the Marketing section. From there, you can tell what you're going to read about on the Marketing section of HubSpot's blog — how to optimize URLs for search. Search engines get it. Readers get it. It doesn't look like spam. All good.</p> \n<div class=\"hsg-featured-snippet\"> \n <h2>URL Slug Best Practices</h2> \n <ol> \n  <li>Keep it as simple as possible.</li> \n  <li>Take out the extra words in the page part of the URL slug.</li> \n  <li>Include relevant keywords.</li> \n  <li>Don't keyword stuff.</li> \n  <li>Make it reader-friendly.</li> \n  <li>Separate words with hyphens.</li> \n  <li>Don't use slugs that already belong to other pages.</li> \n  <li>Avoid using dynamically generated URLs.</li> \n  <li>Standardize your URL naming conventions.</li> \n </ol> \n</div> \n<h3>1. Keep it as simple as possible.</h3> \n<p>In SEO, where much is left to experimentation and theory, it doesn't get much better than the search engine telling you exactly what it prefers.&nbsp;According to <a href=\"https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/76329?hl=en\">Google</a>, \"A site's URL structure should be as simple as possible.\"</p> \n<p>A shorter URL also has the added benefit of being easier to remember should your website visitor want to return to the content without bookmarking it.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>2. Take out the extra words in the page part of the URL slug.</h3> \n<p>In the spirit of keeping things simple, words that add little or no meaning to the URL — like \"and\" or \"that\" — can be removed for the sake of brevity and/or readability. Here's a before &amp; after of this post's URL, for instance:</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" style=\"width: 650px;\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-689109071-png/Blog_Thinkstock_Images/url-slugs.png?width=650&amp;name=url-slugs.png\" alt=\"url slug that reads &quot;how-to-optimize-your-urls-for-search-quick-tip&quot; vs. a better example that reads &quot;how-to-optimize-urls-for-search&quot;\" width=\"650\"></p> \n<p>I removed \"your\" for brevity and the fact that it didn't add any value for readers or search engines. I removed \"quick tip\" for the same reasons since most website visitors will know it's a quick tip from the title or description.</p> \n<p>I could go either way in keeping \"for\" in, but I decided to keep it in because it helps make the URL more readable for humans. If anyone stumbles on this URL elsewhere, I'd like it to be readable so they understand the contents of the page and feel they can trust the site.</p> \n<p>In theory, I could've also chosen \"url-slug\" as the slug. This would've been more desirable in terms of simplicity, but ultimately, I wanted to URL to convey value to readers by explaining what they're getting from the post.</p> \n<h3>3. Include relevant keywords.</h3> \n<p>One way search engines and humans learn about your page contents is through the keywords in the URL. Include keywords in your URL slug, but be sure they align with the actual page contents. Luckily, this URL is already pretty well-optimized as it is, because it's a long-tail search term on its own.</p> \n<h3>4. Don't keyword stuff.</h3> \n<p>Even though this article may be useful for a number of different keywords, that doesn't mean I should have them all in the URL. Otherwise, you're left with a mess like this:</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/seo-url-slug-optimize-urls-best-practices</em></p> \n<p>Wow, that looks ugly.</p> \n<p>Keyword stuffing in content, titles, and URLs is an outdated tactic and only hurts your SEO and the experience on your site. Instead of cramming keywords into the slug, choose a single keyword for the URL and let the content on the page drive the rest of the conversation.</p> \n<h3>5. Make it reader-friendly.</h3> \n<p>We talked about this a little already, but it's worth reiterating. Both search engines and readers should be able to look at your URL and understand what they might find should they click to the other side. That means when you add a bunch of keywords and delete those little extraneous words, you should end up with a URL that still makes sense.</p> \n<h3>6. Separate words with hyphens.</h3> \n<p>Don't use underscores to separate words or try to squish a bunch of words together. The hyphens are meant to help with readability. Use them.</p> \n<h3>7. Don't use slugs that already belong to other pages.&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>Your office/home only has one address, and only one office/home exists at that address. This goes for your website.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Using similar or duplicate slugs can result errors or Google seeing pages as <a href=\"https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/139066?hl=en\">duplicate content</a>. Either scenario will hurt your SEO performance.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>You can also consider updating the settings in your CMS to prevent this from happening accidentally.</p> \n<h3>8. Avoid using dynamically generated URLs.&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>A dynamic URL contains parameters that are automatically generated when the page is loaded. This is in contrast to a static URL that is consistent every time it's accessed.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Dynamic URLs can cause crawling issues, which will result in poor performance.</p> \n<h3>9. Standardize your URL naming conventions.</h3> \n<p>Create a standard process for naming URLs, a system that can be applied to any of the pages and posts you create. This will help you develop a more consistent experience across your site and make navigation simpler and easier for your website visitors.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Your URLs are an important element of on-page SEO, and just one element to consider as you build your site's foundation. By implementing the above best practices for URL slugs and optimizing pages according to additional SEO guidelines, you're one step further to increasing your visibility on search engines such as Google.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p> \n<p><em>Editor's note: This post was originally published in April 2014 and has been updated for comprehensiveness.</em></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fhow-to-optimize-urls-for-search&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 23 Jul 2020 17:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/optimize-url-slugs.jpg#keepProtocol","linkMd5":"b52466068ebde5c5945cc63f90cb88af","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn41@2020_5/2020-07-30/1596118303894_8568b136558930b2.webp","metaImg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/optimize-url-slugs.jpg#keepProtocol","author":"Amanda Sellers","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-689109071-png/Blog_Thinkstock_Images/url-slugs.png?width=650&name=url-slugs.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn73@2020_5/2020-07-30/1596118306506_8a9622a710025896.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fhow-to-optimize-urls-for-search&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn49@2020_2/2020-07-30/1596118305922_b6292fcd69ad6ffb.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-07-30 22:11:40","updatedTime":"2020-07-30 14:11:40","title":"38 Free Online Marketing Classes to Take This Year","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/free-online-marketing-classes","description":"<p>I don't know about you, but I miss taking classes. I miss taking notes, studying, and most of all, learning a ton of new skills.</p> \n<p>That's not to say I don't learn a lot on the job here at HubSpot -- because I absolutely do. But sometimes, there's nothing quite like listening to a lecture, taking notes, and doing homework.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Given the frequency at which new technologies and software are developed, it can be overwhelming to try to keep up your knowledge by only reading blog posts and ebooks. That's where self-paced online learning comes in.</p> \n<p>I've taken a few awesome courses and certifications through <a href=\"https://academy.hubspot.com/\">HubSpot Academy</a>, including an <a href=\"https://certification.hubspot.com/inbound-certification?_ga=1.201491799.798140974.1486135114\">inbound marketing certification</a> and a <a href=\"https://certification.hubspot.com/content-marketing-certification-course?_ga=1.201491799.798140974.1486135114\">content marketing certification</a>. These classes helped me be better at my job, so I started making a list of other classes I could take to learn more skills. When I finished the list, I realized that you, dear readers, might have similar skill gaps, so I wanted to share it in a blog post.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Below is a long list of free online courses you can take to beef up your skill set. These offerings vary in time commitment, but many are self-paced so you can work on your own schedule.

Classes are often taught by marketers at HubSpot and are made up of video lessons, quizzes, and tests. Most HubSpot Academy classes are available free of charge, and if you pass the certifications, such as the two below, you get a nifty certificate and badge to share on your social media profiles. Check out mine on LinkedIn:</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/hubspot%20certifications.png?width=640&amp;name=hubspot%20certifications.png\" alt=\"HubSpot Content Marketing Certification badge\" width=\"640\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 640px;\"></p> \n<h3>Copyblogger</h3> \n<p>Copyblogger is a content marketing company that creates content about content (so meta). Its blog provides a ton of great resources about digital marketing, and this class, \"Internet Marketing for Smart People,\" is made up of ebooks and emailed lessons and other course materials. Copyblogger espouses four pillars of content marketing success, which it delves into over the course of this class.</p> \n<h3>Coursera</h3> \n<p>Coursera offers MOOCs (massive online open courses) created and taught online by universities such as Northwestern University, the University of Pennsylvania, and the University of California system. These courses start at various times throughout the year, so browse the catalog to see when one lines up with your schedule. Below are a couple courses that are perfect for content marketers -- here's what a module for #4 looks like:</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/coursera%20course%20module.png?width=640&amp;name=coursera%20course%20module.png\" alt=\"Coursera content marketing course list\" width=\"640\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 640px;\"></p> \n<h3>QuickSprout</h3> \n<p>QuickSprout is Neil Patel's content and business marketing blog, and QuickSprout University features a ton of helpful videos breaking down and explaining a myriad of concepts and best practices. Each video also includes a transcript in case reading is more your learning style than watching a video. Here's what one course video looks like:</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/quicksprout-1.png?width=640&amp;name=quicksprout-1.png\" alt=\"Quicksprout content marketing course\" width=\"640\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 640px;\"></p> \n<h3>Udemy</h3> \n<p>Udemy is another online learning platform that focuses specifically on courses related to skill building for working professionals. One thing to note about Udemy: The classes we've highlighted are free, but it offers a myriad of other paid options for as little as $10, in some cases. If you have a good experience with a free course, it could be worth a small investment to deepen your skills, too.</p> \n<h3>Wordstream</h3> \n<p>Wordstream is a search engine and social media marketing software company that helps marketers drive the greatest ROI from their paid search and social media campaigns. These free guides and ebooks distill learnings and best practices for users with varying levels of expertise running pay-per-click (PPC) campaigns. Here are some of its topics and offerings:</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/PPCuniversity.png?width=640&amp;name=PPCuniversity.png\" alt=\"Wordstream social media marketing course on how to run PPC campaigns\" width=\"640\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 640px;\"></p> \n<h3>edX</h3> \n<p>edX is another MOOC provider that features courses offered by top-tier universities, including Harvard University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Boston University. Like Coursera, classes are taught online and start at specific times throughout the year. Here's a class we think you'll find valuable:</p> \n<h3>Alison</h3> \n<p>Alison offers free online classes in various professional skills users can take at their own pace. In the Diploma in Social Media Marketing course below, students can get into the nitty-gritty and big picture views of different skills of different topics -- just check out one of the many modules:</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/alisontopiclist.png?width=600&amp;name=alisontopiclist.png\" alt=\"ALISON digital marketing course module\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<h3>Facebook</h3> \n<p>At this point, you probably already know what Facebook is and what it does. What you might not know? It has a training and certification program. Facebook Blueprint offers self-paced and live e-learning courses for marketers seeking to grow their organizations using Facebook. Blueprint offers classes in different languages on how to use Facebook and Instagram -- here's a peek at the course catalog.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/facebookblueprint.png?width=640&amp;name=facebookblueprint.png\" alt=\"Facebook Blueprint social media marketing course catalog\" width=\"640\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 640px;\"></p> \n<h3>quintly</h3> \n<p>quintly is a social media analytics tool that offers courses through quintly Academy. The self-paced course provides an overview of social media analytics, benchmarking, and goaling using downloadable written materials and video lessons.</p> \n<h3>Buffer</h3> \n<p>Buffer's Social Media Week of Webinars isn't exactly a course -- it's a series of live webinar recordings on YouTube -- but the videos are chock-full of current and valuable information for social media marketers from the experts. Topics include Instagram and Facebook marketing and how to do public relations on social media.</p> \n<h3>Google</h3> \n<p>Google is another company you've probably heard of before, and its digital marketing course offers a ton of valuable information if you plan to advertise and rank on the search engine. You can even take a Google AdWords certification at the end of the process that helps you beef up your resume (and your Google+ profile).</p> \n<h3>CodeAcademy</h3> \n<p>CodeAcademy offers free, interactive coding classes that take you from lesson one to building a fully-functioning website. The courses we've highlighted below are just a few of the courses; CodeAcademy offers many more, depending on your organization's needs.

Some marketers have trouble generating enough leads to feed their sales team. Others generate plenty of leads, but <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/signs-your-lead-is-a-terrible-fit\">they're not good leads</a>, and your sales team is having trouble closing them into customers. Others just have no idea where their leads are coming from.</p> \n<p>These are all common <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/beginner-inbound-lead-generation-guide-ht?utm_campaign=Leadin%20Blog%20Post%20-%20Lead%20Generation%20Mistakes%20Oct%202016&amp;utm_source=HS-blog\">problems marketers have with lead generation</a>. In this post, we'll go over many of these problems and talk about how to fix them. We'll also highlight a few tips directly from HubSpot acquisition experts.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h2>10 Lead Generation Mistakes Marketers Should Avoid</h2> \n<h3>1. You're buying leads, not generating them organically.</h3> \n<p>If you're having trouble generating leads, it can be tempting to buy email lists so you can feed your sales organization with something -- <em>anything. </em>But buying or renting contacts out of desperation will cause you more long-term (and short-term) harm than good.</p> \n<p>There are <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/32892/Why-Purchasing-Email-Lists-Is-Always-a-Bad-Idea.aspx\">a lot of reasons buying email lists is never a good idea</a>. Not only will sending emails to purchased lists <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/30594/a-marketer-s-guide-to-getting-past-email-spam-filters.aspx\">harm your email deliverability</a> and IP reputation, but there's a good chance the people on your purchased list have never heard of your company -- making them far more likely to mark you as spam. They'll also think you're super annoying. And you're not annoying, are you?</p> \n<p><strong>Bottom line here is that quality email addresses simply aren't for sale.</strong> The whole point of generating leads is to eventually nurture those leads into customers. In order for your leads to become customers, the leads you generate need to actually want to hear from you.</p> \n<h4>How to Fix It</h4> \n<p>Your leads need to opt in, plain and simple. This means your contacts chose to give you their information in exchange for something valuable, like a content offer, webinar, event, and so on. Focus on creating offers that are valuable in some way for your target audience, and then package that value and put it behind a <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/forms\">lead capture form</a>.</p> \n<p>Growing a healthy, opt-in email list takes time, but it's worth its weight in gold down the line. And once you have people to email, be sure you're <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/free-guide-to-optimizing-email-marketing-for-conversions\">creating remarkable email content</a> that makes people want to actually open your emails and stay subscribed.</p> \n<h3>2. You don't offer lead-gen content for people in different stages of the buyer's journey.</h3> \n<p>Not everyone who visits your website is going to be in the same stage of <a href=\"https://academy.hubspot.com/broadcasts/the-buyers-journey\">their buyer's journey</a>. Think about the folks who are landing on your website for the very first time. Do you think they're ready to see a demo of your product? Or do you think they'd be more likely to want to download a helpful piece of content, like a step-by-step guide?</p> \n<p>Some of your site visitors might be ready to buy, but most won't -- and you need to give them the opportunities to learn more about your business and what you're selling before asking them take any sort of purchase action.</p> \n<p>Creating valuable content to teach and nurture your leads down the funnel is time-consuming, which is why so often you'll browse a business' website and see nothing but \"Buy Now!\" and \"Click Here for a Free Demo!\" all over the place.</p> \n<h4>How to Fix It</h4> \n<p>There is no one-size-fits-all CTA for everyone who visits your website. To maximize clickthrough rates, you'll want to cater to visitors who are at all different stages of the buyer's journey using CTAs.</p> \n<p>So, yes -- you'll need to spend time creating a variety of offers you can put behind landing page forms that cater to people at different stages. Folks who are just starting to get to know you might be interested in offers like checklists, contests, and templates. Visitors who are a little further down the funnel might be interested in email courses, kits, and whitepapers. Folks even further down might be ready for a demo.</p> \n<p>Make sure you're creating content that cover the whole funnel, and that you're offering this content on your website so there's something for everyone. (Need ideas for lead gen content? <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/lead-gen-content-ideas\">Here are 23 ideas</a> for you.)</p> \n<p>If you want to take personalization a step further, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/customers/smart-ctas-personalization\">use smart CTAs</a>. Smart CTAs are CTAs that change depending on the person viewing the page -- his or her interests, location, pages viewed already, items or services bought before, and so on. Unsurprisingly, <strong>personalized CTAS actually convert <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/personalized-calls-to-action-convert-better-data\">42% more visitors</a> than basic calls-to-action. </strong>They make for a better user experience for your user, and higher conversion rates for you: a win-win!

You aren't using your blog to generate leads.</h3> \n<p>HubSpot's blog is responsible for a significant percentage of our marketing team's incoming leads.</p> \n<p>In fact, at one point, we found that <strong><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/76%%20of%20our%20monthly%20blog%20views%20came%20from%20&quot;old&quot;%20posts%20(in%20other%20words,%20posts%20published%20prior%20to%20that%20month).\">76% of our monthly blog views </a></strong>come from \"old\" posts (in other words, posts published prior to that month). We always joke that if the entire blogging team went on vacation for a month, we'd still hit a good portion of our leads goal.</p> \n<p>“At HubSpot, we have an entire team dedicated to continuously optimizing our blog conversion strategy,\" says Carly Stec, HubSpot's Team Manager of content acquisition. \"This group works in lockstep with our SEO team and writers to provide insight into the topics that are converting well to ensure a well-rounded editorial mix.\"</p> \n<p>\"This level of alignment allows us to provide blog readers with helpful next steps based on their intent,” Stec adds.</p> \n<p>Despite <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/business-blogging-in-2015\">blogging's many lead generation benefits</a>, we find that marketers aren't fully taking advantage of this tactic as a lead generation powerhouse. Either folks aren't blogging at all, or they're not putting lead capture forms or CTAs on their blog -- sometimes because they don't have any valuable content offers to put behind a form.</p> \n<p>But, still one of <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/the-benefits-of-business-blogging-ht\">the biggest benefits of business blogging</a> is converting the traffic it brings you into leads. Just like every blog post you write is another indexed page, each post is a new opportunity to generate new leads. Here's what that looks like in numbers: If each one of your blog posts gets about 100 views per month, and your visitor-to-lead conversion rate on the blog is about 2%, then you'd get two leads from a single blog post each month. If you write 30 blog posts per month, you'd get 60 leads in a month -- two from each blog post.</p> \n<p>Keep blogging consistently like that for a year, and thanks to each blog post's<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/hubspot-blog-compounding-posts\"> compounding value over time</a>, each post you write will drive value for you in the form of traffic and leads. By the end of 12 months, you'll end up getting 4,680 opt-in contacts per month, not just 720 opt-in contacts (60 leads*12 months).</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/blogging_compounding_returns-5.jpg?width=640&amp;name=blogging_compounding_returns-5.jpg\" alt=\"blogging_compounding_returns-5.jpg\" width=\"640\" style=\"width: 640px;\"></p> \n<h4>How to Fix It</h4> \n<p>Generating leads from your blog posts is simple: Just add a <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/call-to-action-templates\">lead-generating call-to-action</a> to every blog post. Most of the time, these CTAs will lead to landing pages offering free content like ebooks, whitepapers, checklists, webinars, free trials, and so on. Promote your content offers by blogging about subject matters related to them, and then put CTAs that lead to the asset's landing page on every one of those blog posts.</p> \n<p>What that CTA looks like on your blog posts is up to you. On HubSpot's blog, we use three main types of CTAs on our blog: end-of-post banner CTAs on every single post, and slide-in CTAs and anchor text CTAs on select posts. <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/blog-anchor-text-call-to-action-study\">Read this post</a> to learn when it's appropriate to use end-of-post banner CTAs, anchor text CTAs, or both.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/end-of-post-cta-banner-1-1.png?width=640&amp;name=end-of-post-cta-banner-1-1.png\" alt=\"end-of-post-cta-banner-1-1.png\" width=\"640\" style=\"width: 640px;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/anchor-text-cta%20(1).png?width=640&amp;name=anchor-text-cta%20(1).png\" alt=\"anchor-text-cta (1).png\" width=\"640\" style=\"width: 640px;\"></p> \n<p>As for <a href=\"http://leadin.hubspot.com/free?utm_campaign=marketing-blog-CTA&amp;utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=HS-Marketing&amp;utm_content=Lead%20Generation%20Mistakes%20Marketers%20Need%20to%20Stop%20Making&amp;utm_id=\">slide-in CTAs</a>, we've found these to perform better than end-of-post CTAs -- which makes sense because visitors see them sooner since they slide in at about 25%-50% of the way down the post. <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-add-a-slide-in-call-to-action-to-your-blog-posts\">Learn how to add slide-in CTAs to your blog posts here</a>.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/slide-in-cta-example-1.png?width=640&amp;name=slide-in-cta-example-1.png\" alt=\"slide-in-cta-example-1.png\" width=\"640\" style=\"width: 640px;\"></p> \n<h3>4. You aren't using the best lead generation tools.</h3> \n<p>You know that people are coming to your website, but do you know who they are? How about what they're doing once they get there, or what they're doing before and after taking certain actions? If you're unable to answer these questions, then you're going to have a hard time connecting with the people who are visiting your site or learning what's resonating with them and what's not.</p> \n<p>But these are questions you can and should answer -- but you need the right tools to do it. There are some great tools out there that can help you learn about your website visitors and convert them into leads.</p> \n<h4>How to Fix It</h4> \n<p>The trick is finding the best combination of tools that'll give you the most insight and the best bang for your buck. There are a few different tools and templates out there that'll help you create different lead gen assets you can put on your site.</p> \n<p>At the simplest level, <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/call-to-action-templates\">these 50+ free, customizable CTA Templates</a> will help you create clickable buttons you can put on your blog, your landing pages, and elsewhere on your site. Use them to create CTAs that lead to a landing page form.</p> \n<p>Speaking of forms, a form embedding tool will come in handy when it comes to actually collecting information from your site visitors and converting them into leads. If you're a HubSpot customer, you can <a href=\"https://knowledge.hubspot.com/articles/kcs_article/forms/where-can-i-find-the-embed-code-for-my-forms\">create and embed forms using HubSpot</a>. Non-HubSpot customers can use a tool like Contact Form 7, JetPack, or Google Forms, and then <a href=\"http://leadin.hubspot.com/knowledge/collected-forms?utm_campaign=marketing-blog-CTA&amp;utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=HS-Marketing&amp;utm_content=How%20to%20Generate%20Leads%20from%20the%20Most%20Popular%20Pages%20on%20Your%20Website&amp;utm_id=\">use Leadin's free Collected Forms tool</a> to automatically capture these form submissions on your website.</p> \n<p>Finally, a lead capture and contact insights tool like <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/lead-flows\">Lead Flows by HubSpot</a><a href=\"http://leadin.hubspot.com/free?utm_campaign=marketing-blog-CTA&amp;utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=HS-Marketing&amp;utm_content=Lead%20Generation%20Mistakes%20Marketers%20Need%20to%20Stop%20Making&amp;utm_id=\">&nbsp;</a>(which is free) will help you capture leads using pop-ups, dropdown banners, or slide-ins. It'll also scrape any pre-existing forms you have on your website and add those contacts to your existing contact database.</p> \n<p>Here's an example of a slide-in CTA created with <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/lead-flows\">Lead Flows</a>, HubSpot's free conversion tool:</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/slide-in-lead-flow.gif?width=640&amp;name=slide-in-lead-flow.gif\" alt=\"slide-in-lead-flow.gif\" width=\"640\" style=\"width: 640px;\"></p> \n<h3>5. You have a \"right vs. wrong\" testing mindset.</h3> \n<p>Knowing that you should test your website and constantly work on improving it is one thing. What most marketers have trouble with is seeing testing and experimenting not as a way to prove your ideas, but as a way to find something better.</p> \n<p>I like the way Andrew Anderson put it <a href=\"http://conversionxl.com/the-psychology-of-a-successful-testing-program/\">in his post on ConversionXL</a>: \"The real challenge is in getting yourself and your organization ready to accept one really simple truth: Being wrong is far more valuable than being right.\"</p> \n<p>Often, this will manifest itself in someone having an idea for how to improve a part of their website. Perhaps they think removing distractions from a landing page will increase conversion rates on that page, for instance. What happens here is that most marketers will limit what they test in a way that skews the data to help them reach that conclusion, often without meaning it. After all, it feels bad -- and might look bad -- to have an idea or make an assumption and have it proven totally wrong.</p> \n<h4>How to Fix It</h4> \n<p>\"The first and most vital step to dealing with this is to focus all discussions on the comparing of actions and not on validating opinions,\" writes Anderson. \"It isn’t about if Tactic A or B works, it is how well does Tactic A or B or C or D and so on compare to each other.\"</p> \n<p>In other words, treat every idea that's brought to the table the same, whether or not you think it'll \"win.\" This makes the testing program less personal and encourages a more holistic approach. Remember: by nature, a program that tests your website is meant to prove yourself and others wrong, and that's a good thing.</p> \n<p>You and your teammates need to check your egos and adopt this mindset to avoid finger-pointing. Instead of rewarding people for being right, which reinforces that toxic mindset, focus on the system and the outcomes more holistically.</p> \n<h3>6. You aren't optimizing your top pages for lead generation.</h3> \n<p>Not all webpages should be treated the same. In fact, if you look at traffic numbers to specific pages on your website, you'll probably find that the vast majority of your traffic is coming in to a few, very specific pages -- maybe your homepage; your \"Contact Us\" page; maybe one or two popular blog posts. With so many people landing on those pages, why would you treat them like any other ol' page on your website?</p> \n<p>Because so many people are landing on those pages, it's very important that you create opportunities for people to convert on those pages, lest you leave potentially massive lead numbers on the table.</p> \n<h4>How to Fix It</h4> \n<p>First, figure out which of your webpages are the four or five most popular for traffic. (HubSpot customers: You can do this in HubSpot by going to Reports &gt; Page Performance, then filter the report by Views.)</p> \n<p>Then, optimize those pages for leads. This means making sure you create calls-to-action (CTAs) that stand out from the page, and then place them where people naturally look on your website. Our natural eye path starts in the upper left-hand corner of a website and moves on from there, <a href=\"http://blog.eyequant.com/blog/2014/01/15/the-3-most-surprising-insights-from-a-200-website-eye-tracking-study\">according to an eyetracking study</a>.</p> \n<p>Another way to increase the conversion rate on a page that already gets a lot of traffic? Create special offers specifically for your most popular pages, and gate them behind landing page forms. I know, I know, creating a brand new offer can time-consuming -- but it could be <em>much</em> more <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/beginner-inbound-lead-generation-guide-ht?utm_campaign=Leadin%20Blog%20Post%20-%20Lead%20Generation%20Mistakes%20Oct%202016&amp;utm_source=HS-blog\">effective for lead generation</a> than optimizing button color, language, images, and so on. For example, the folks at Eastern International College <a href=\"http://www.eicollege.edu/quiz.aspx\">created a quiz</a> for students on which college major they should choose, which they linked to on their popular Careers page.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/eastern-international-college-quiz.png?width=640&amp;name=eastern-international-college-quiz.png\" alt=\"eastern-international-college-quiz.png\" width=\"640\" title=\"eastern-international-college-quiz.png\" style=\"width: 640px;\"></p> \n<p>At the end of the quiz, they promised to send the quiz results in exchange for people's name, phone number, and email address <a href=\"https://www.tryinteract.com/blog/how-to-generate-leads-on-social-media-using-quizzes-this-example-got-125-in-20-days/\">as a lead capture tactic</a>.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/lead-generation-tips-for-popular-webpages\">Read this blog post for more tips</a> on how to generate leads from your most popular webpages.</p> \n<h3>7. You're ONLY optimizing your top pages for lead-generation.</h3> \n<p>Yes. When you have a page that earns high traffic, it might also win over a lot more leads. However, AJ Beltis, a HubSpot marketing manager who specializes in content creation and lead acquisition, says you might be missing solid opportunities by only optimizing high-traffic-getters.</p> \n<p>\"It’s tempting for content marketers to immediately go to the most-viewed blog posts and try to convert their viewers into leads. High traffic means high potential, so it makes sense to look at these posts first,\" Beltis says.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\"However, those most-viewed posts are often on topics that cast a wide net and might not tie directly back to your product or service,\" Beltis explains. \"Instead, try focusing on blog posts or topic clusters that may not have the most views, but have a clear path for conversion.</p> \n<p>\"After all, what’s better – a 5% conversion rate for a blog post with 50,000 views, or a 1% conversion rate on a blog post with 100,000 views,\" Beltis concludes.</p> \n<h4>How to Fix It</h4> \n<p>Finding posts with conversion opportunities that don't pull in major traffic can take a bit of research.</p> \n<p>Using HubSpot, or other data-tracking tools, consider creating and analyzing a conversion rate optimization report that highlights each post's <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/conversion-rate-optimization-guide\">conversion rate, number of new contacts, and lead goal.</a> This will allow you to see how each post is performing and help you zone on posts that are pulling in a solid number of contacts. It will also allow you to see how traffic impacts a conversion rate.</p> \n<p>For example, if you see a low conversion rate on a post but a high number of contacts, this could mean the post has many leads due in part to its traffic. On the other hand, if you see a post with a lower contact number but a higher conversion rate, this could be a lower traffic post with a higher chance of pulling in leads.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Aside from using the reporting tools you have at hand to learn from your own data, you could also ask yourself a few topic-related questions like:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>What are our audience's interested in learning more about?:</strong> Sometimes, trends that impact people in your industry might be highly discussed on social media, but haven't yet gained enough search volume to pull in high traffic. Are there trend-related blog posts and content offers you can create or update that can tie well together, provide value to your audience, and get them to convert?</li> \n <li><strong>Do we have any tactical posts that relate strongly to our product or current offers?:</strong> For example, if you sell a task-management software, a post on how to multitask, how to organize your office, or how to create a project schedule might not be shareable on social media or pull in huge traffic, but it still could align well with an offer related to your product -- such as a free trial.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>8. You're not using social media strategically for lead generation.</h3> \n<p>Although social media is most effective for top-of-the-funnel marketing metrics like traffic and brand awareness, it can still be helpful as a source for lead generation -- and a low-cost one, at that.</p> \n<p>If you're finding that social media isn't generating very many leads for you, there's a chance you're not doing it strategically enough. At least that's what Jeremy White, a serial entrepreneur and conversion consultant, <a href=\"https://blog.crazyegg.com/2014/04/14/b2b-lead-gen/\">wrote in a post on CrazyEgg's blog</a>.</p> \n<p>\"It’s not that you <i>can’t</i> get leads on social media; it’s that we’re not taking what’s there,\" he wrote. In other words, you might be doing it wrong. If your social strategy is to post your new ebooks to all your social media channels and that's about it, then don't expect to bring in a whole lot of leads from those posts. The spray-and-pray technique isn't enough.</p> \n<h4>How to Fix It</h4> \n<p>One way to generate more leads from social media is to sprinkle blog posts and offers that have historically generated higher-than-average leads numbers for you in with the new posts and offers your team is creating.</p> \n<p>At HubSpot, we've found that one of the best ways to generate leads is simply to link directly to landing pages for blog posts and offers that have historically performed well for lead generation. (<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/blog-lead-generation-analysis\">Learn how to do your own blog lead generation analysis here</a>.)</p> \n<p>We've also found that linking directly to an offer's landing page can be more effective -- as long as your post copy sets the expectation that you are, in fact, sending people to a landing page. In the Facebook post below, we set that expectation by putting \"Free Template\" in brackets in front of the offer title.</p> \n<iframe style=\"border: none; overflow: hidden; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\" src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fhubspot%2Fposts%2F10154680768144394&amp;width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"501\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> \n<p>You'll also want to make sure you're using some of the features on each social network that are specifically designed to help you generate leads.</p> \n<p><strong>On Twitter,</strong> your lead gen tweets should contain a value proposition, a short URL linking to the landing page with a form, and an image to ensure the post stands out. (<a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/templates-shareable-graphics-social-media\">Here are some social media image templates</a> you can use to create those images.)</p>  \n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"> \n <p>Your design skills nonexistent? You're gonna want these templates: <a href=\"https://t.co/7fxTWZw3BC\">https://t.co/7fxTWZw3BC</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/CKvgfyuZpY\">pic.twitter.com/CKvgfyuZpY</a></p> — HubSpot (@HubSpot) \n <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HubSpot/status/790437932813484032\">October 24, 2016</a>\n</blockquote>   \n<p>Twitter also offers lead generation cards that can help you generate qualified leads at a lower cost than most of the other major ad platforms. Twitter cards let you embed rich media that don't count toward your tweet character limit that allow your fans and followers to do things like download an app, visit a landing page, give over their email, or use a coupon -- all without leaving Twitter. (HubSpot customers: You can connect your Twitter lead gen cards to HubSpot by <a href=\"https://knowledge.hubspot.com/articles/kcs_article/forms/can-i-connect-twitter-lead-generation-cards-to-hubspot-forms\">following these instructions</a>.)</p> \n<p><strong>On Facebook:</strong> There are a number of great ways to generate leads from Facebook, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/facebook-lead-generation-tips-ht\">the best of which I've rounded up in this blog post</a>. For example, one way to easily generate leads is by simply using the call-to-action feature available for Pages. The feature lets you put a simple call-to-action button at the top of your Facebook Page, and it can help drive more traffic from your Facebook Page to lead generation forms like landing pages and contact sheets.</p> \n<p>Here's an example from Tough Mudder's Page, and you can <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/facebook-cta-button\">learn how to insert your own Facebook CTA button here</a>.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/tough-mudder-facebook-for-lead-gen.png?width=640&amp;name=tough-mudder-facebook-for-lead-gen.png\" alt=\"tough-mudder-facebook-for-lead-gen.png\" width=\"640\" style=\"width: 640px;\"></p> \n<p><strong>On LinkedIn,</strong> B2B businesses can take advantage of the perception that LinkedIn is the most sophisticated of social platforms, and a place where B2B relationships are most likely to be built. Like on Facebook, you can publish your lead-generating content directly to your business' Facebook Page alongside actionable copy and a compelling image.</p> \n<h3>9. Your forms are too long or too short.</h3> \n<p>How long should your lead capture forms be? Striking a balance between asking too much and too little on your forms is a common problem marketers gripe with.</p> \n<p>If your form's too short, more people might be willing to fill it out, which is great for leads numbers -- but the <em>quality</em> of those leads might not be very high. If your form's too long, though, fewer people might be willing to fill it out, meaning you'll get fewer leads out of it. On the bright side, the people who <em>do </em>submit their information could end up being higher quality leads.</p> \n<p>So what gives? What's the \"magic number\" of questions to ask on your forms?</p> \n<h4>How to Fix It</h4> \n<p>There's no hard-and-fast rule for <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/32079/How-Long-Should-Your-Landing-Page-Forms-Be.aspx\">how many fields to put on your forms</a>. Your \"sweet spot\" will depend entirely on your goals: Do you need <em>more </em>leads, or do you need <em>better </em>leads? Essentially, the length of your form will lead to a tradeoff between quantity and quality of the leads you generate. In general, s<span class=\"s1\">horter forms usually result in more overall leads, while longer forms will result in fewer, but <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/30889/How-to-Expose-the-Best-Leads-to-Your-Sales-Team.aspx?_ga=1.175987234.1456347280.1474306255\">higher quality leads</a>.</span></p> \n<p><span class=\"s1\">“Think of every field in your checkout as a hurdle your prospect has to leap over,\" <a href=\"http://www.copyblogger.com/high-converting-checkouts/\">writes Copyhackers' Joanna Wiebe</a>. \"Then ask yourself if it’s worth the possibility of losing a sale — or thousands of sales — because you want to fill a database.\"</span></p> \n<p><span class=\"s1\">You can’t possibly know how many form fields you can pull off without conducting conversion research and running your own tests. Even then, you have to compare the ROI of additional information with the ROI of increased conversions. How much does having a phone number <em>really</em> help the sales team? Is it enough to warrant a potential decrease in conversions?</span></p> \n<p>It's important that you don't make this decision without involving your sales team. They have a better idea of what information will actually help them close deals. How much does asking for a phone number actually help your sales team -- and is it enough to potentially lose leads over? Speaking of talking with your sales team ...</p> \n<h3>10. Your definition of a qualified lead isn't well communicated with your sales department.</h3> \n<p>You know the definition of a lead in the general sense of the term: It's a person who has indicated interest in your company's product or service by giving you their information in some way, like by filling out a form to download an ebook or completing an online survey.</p> \n<p>A marketing qualified lead, or MQL, is a lead that's been deemed more likely to become a customer compared to other leads, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/lead-scoring-instructions\">based on lead intelligence</a>. MQLs have metaphorically raised their hands and identified themselves as more deeply engaged, sales-ready contacts than your usual leads, but who have not yet become full-fledged opportunities. In other words, from a marketing perspective, your sales team should be talking with them.</p> \n<p>But sales teams tend to have their own system for qualifying leads. Sales qualified leads are leads your sales team has accepted as worthy of a direct sales follow-up. Agreeing on that quality threshold is where things tend to get muddy. Both the quantity and quality of leads needed and the sales process are mutually agreed upon by both Marketing and Sales.</p> \n<h4>How to Fix It</h4> \n<p>That's exactly where the conversation begins. To align Marketing and Sales on what constitutes a qualified lead from both sides, you'll have to learn to speak each other's language. Similar to your marketing qualified leads, Sales has its own definition of \"qualified\": sales qualified leads are leads they've accepted as worthy of a direct sales follow-up.</p> \n<p>Both teams need to align on their definitions of a marketing qualified and sales qualified lead. And there's no one-size-fits-all definition for one, either -- an MQL at one company may be completely different than an MQL at another company. You should do your own internal <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/closed-loop-marketing/\" title=\"analysis of your leads and customers\">analysis of your leads and customers</a> to create your business’ definition of an MQL. <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/30889/How-to-Expose-the-Best-Leads-to-Your-Sales-Team.aspx\">Read this post to learn</a> how to get started defining an MQL for your business and communicating that definition with Sales.</p> \n<h2>Avoid Losing Great Leads</h2> \n<p>There are plenty more lead generation mistakes we could add to this list, but these are some of the most important ones we see marketers make every day.

If you're like me, your answer is probably up in the dozens. I could click on an ad about ice cream, and five minutes later, find myself looking at YouTube videos of homemade sundaes.</p>  \n<p>Sometimes, though, I come across an ad that's seamless — They're quick to grab my attention, and it tells me everything I need to know when I reach the landing page.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>This morning, for example, I checked my timeline. I came across this ad while scrolling, and because I saw my favorite colors in the ad, I had to click on the image.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/The%20Ins%20and%20Outs%20of%20Facebook%20Landing%20Pages.gif\" alt=\"Example of a Facebook landing page.\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n</div> \n<p>The landing page wasn't busy. In fact, the simplicity caught my attention. All the page had was text, an image, and a CTA. I noticed how the ad and landing page were centered around the same product.</p> \n<p>It was effective because its only purpose was to get me to fill out the free trial offer, and that's exactly what I did. After all, I wanted to track my personal Instagram posts.</p> \n<p>As far as Facebook landing pages go, this one was great.</p> \n<p>Have you ever made a landing page specifically for Facebook ads? If the thought of creating another landing page just for social media sounds like a burden you'd rather avoid, don't worry. In most cases, you won't need to make more than a few small adjustments to one you already have.</p> \n<p>If you're ready to dive into what makes Facebook landing pages a must for ads, read on, and let's get started.</p> \n<p>A <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/landing-page-best-practices?_ga=2.169832808.831801315.1596056938-940436819.1565181751\">landing page</a> is a web page visitors \"land\" on when they engage with an ad or offer. The purpose of a landing page is to drive action by offering something of value in exchange for lead information. Usually, they'll have a form to download a free ebook, receive a demo, get a template, or something similar.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/The%20Ins%20and%20Outs%20of%20Facebook%20Landing%20Pages-Jul-29-2020-08-49-32-45-PM.png\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" alt=\"Example of a good landing page.\">\n</div> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'times new roman', times;\"><a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/crm/e010a\">Image Source</a></span></p> \n<p>Good landing pages, like the one above, reflect the company and include at least one CTA. Facebook landing pages have the same goal.</p> \n<p>Facebook landing pages refer to the ones attached to Facebook ads. They're still meant to entice audience members to take action, but are optimized for use on Facebook.</p> \n<p>Just like there's best practices for <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/landing-page-examples-list?_ga=2.233206871.831801315.1596056938-940436819.1565181751\">creating landing pages</a> for your website, there's some for those linked to Facebook ads. They have to do with your ad goals and optimizing the content for audiences.</p> \n<p>They shouldn't differ largely from landing pages on your website, in fact, they should mirror your brand. You'll just have different things to look for — So instead of traffic being the number one priority, now it might be the number of shares or comments. If you're someone who benefits from visual examples like I do, don't worry, we'll go over best practices, as well.</p> \n<p>So let's dive into how to create a landing page that'll be an amazing experience for your Facebook audience.</p> \n<p>There's no landing page creation tool for Facebook, but you can insert them into ads via Ad Manager to boost leads and conversions. Even without this function, the website has general pointers for making your pages stand out to audiences.</p> \n<p>Facebook suggests making the page easy to navigate. The content should be straightforward and relevant to its supporting ad to prevent confusion. And finally, match the page with the overall branding of your website.</p> \n<p>Those are pretty straightforward, right? Upload a page that's comprehensive and branded. But there's a little more to it than that — let's take a deeper look at creating Facebook landing pages.</p> \n<p>For this example, let's pretend I'm creating a Facebook landing page for an ebook offer. The ebook is directly related to the services my fictional PR company, Off The Press Release, provides. This offer and ad are intended to increase conversions.</p> \n<h3>1. Choose a template.</h3> \n<p>I am not a website designer, so I decided to use a landing page builder to make mine, and it turned out looking awesome. For this design, I decided to use <a href=\"https://www.wix.com/\">Wix</a>, but you can use any software with webpage tools, like <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/landing-pages?_ga=2.123705410.831801315.1596056938-940436819.1565181751\">HubSpot</a> or <a href=\"https://mailchimp.com/\">Mailchimp</a>.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/The%20Ins%20and%20Outs%20of%20Facebook%20Landing%20Pages-4.png\" alt=\"Wix template choices.\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n</div> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'times new roman', times;\"><a href=\"https://www.wix.com/website/templates/html/landing-pages/promotional-page\">Image Source</a></span></p> \n<p>When picking my template, I wanted to go with one that would best serve my offer. I decided that one with a simple form and text — that way, I wouldn't have much to edit, and the static design wouldn't distract Facebook viewers.</p> \n<p>A simple template for a conversion ad is ideal. Landing pages should be a simple design so they don't distract audiences from engaging with the right content. In this case, an ebook offer.</p> \n<h3>2. Brand the content.</h3> \n<p>With a template picked out, I changed the design to fit with my brand. First, I added new colors: Pink, and midnight blue, to match my company. Then, I changed the text to appear more conversational and relevant to my offer.</p> \n<p>I wanted my copy to connect with my Facebook audience. Additionally, I chose colors that were appealing — They weren't too bright or dim.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/The%20Ins%20and%20Outs%20of%20Facebook%20Landing%20Pages-1.png\" alt=\"Wix's landing page editor. \" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n</div> \n<p>Think about which logo, images, and copy will make your message come across the best to your Facebook audiences. If you've noticed your audience responds really well to cool tones, use the darker versions of your company colors for assets like landing pages.</p> \n<p>If you're stuck with coming up with <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/search-ad-copy?_ga=2.123705410.831801315.1596056938-940436819.1565181751\">copy that'll speak to your customers</a>, or want <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ad-design?_ga=2.199718119.831801315.1596056938-940436819.1565181751\">branding advice from experts</a>, we've got you covered.</p> \n<h3>3. Make the CTA the star of the page.</h3> \n<p>This ad's goal was to earn as many downloads as possible. To make that happen, I used the design to make the CTA the star by placing it in a visible position on the page. Doing this makes it only easier for audiences to complete the action.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/The%20Ins%20and%20Outs%20of%20Facebook%20Landing%20Pages-2.png\" alt=\"How to edit the CTA on Wix.\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n</div> \n<p>The action you want Facebook users to take on your landing page should be clear. All copy should point to a clear CTA. It's helpful to make the button a different color. I chose gray, for instance, because it was a color I hadn't previously used.</p> \n<p>Or let's say you work for a retail company. If the ad intent is to boost sales, the landing page could be an offer for a percentage off in exchange for signing up for emails. Whatever you're giving the consumer should be front and center, along with the button to get there.</p> \n<h3>4. Preview and test your page.</h3> \n<p>When you're satisfied with your page, view it in preview mode. Seeing it from the viewer's perspective catches mistakes. Additionally, you can make last minute changes to best fit multiple screen types.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/The%20Ins%20and%20Outs%20of%20Facebook%20Landing%20Pages.png\" alt=\"Viewing a landing page in Preview mode on Wix. \" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n</div> \n<p>If you have the time, test your page. One of Facebook's Paid Ads managers, Nicole Ondracek, cites testing landing pages as a <em>must</em>. \"Testing is very useful because we have the most concrete data about how to make our pages more effective for Facebook,\" she says.</p> \n<p>Check to see if your software has testing features. Mine did not, but <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/crm?_ga=2.199718119.831801315.1596056938-940436819.1565181751\">HubSpot's CRM</a> and Facebook both have testing tools that could give useful data, like conversions and click-through rates. I could run a landing page A/B test using HubSpot's software, then test the ad using the winning A/B test page.</p> \n<h3>5. Upload it into the Ad Manager.</h3> \n<p>When you're satisfied with your landing page ad, save it and switch gears over to Ad Manager. From here, the process is pretty intuitive — especially if you've created an ad before. After picking your ad type, it's pretty much just filling in numerous fields.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/The%20Ins%20and%20Outs%20of%20Facebook%20Landing%20Pages-Jul-29-2020-08-49-32-71-PM.png\" alt=\"Example of uploading your landing page on Facebook\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n</div> \n<p>The fields \"Primary Text,\" \"Headline,\" and \"Description\" are going to be visible to audiences, so fill them in accordingly. For example, the primary text of my ad introduces my company, the offer, and what's inside.</p> \n<p>Headlines emphasize the offer's subject, while the description gives more detail. Every field but primary text is optional, so you don't have to make the ad as wordy as I have. Add enough text to convey what you're advertising and the tone of your company.</p> \n<p>As soon as you've got these fields settled, you've chosen your target audience, your ad is ready to run. Click \"Publish!\" to finish configuring details like budget and duration. And, if you need a full guide on setting up a Facebook ad, <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/facebook-marketing/facebook-lead-ads?_ga=2.225555539.831801315.1596056938-940436819.1565181751\">this post is an amazing help</a>.</p> \n<p>So now, you know how to make a landing page for Facebook ads. Now, it's time to go over how, and why, to optimize those landing pages for audiences.</p> \n<h2>Facebook Landing Page Best Practices</h2> \n<p>Think about the intent of your audience. What kind of landing page will make them interested in your offer? These design and optimization tips are a handy bookmark to make sure the content lines up with customer preference.</p> \n<h3>1. Give the page its own URL.</h3> \n<p>If you're using a landing page that already exists, and you want to track leads from Paid ads, give the page its own URL. Direct response ads, ads that are meant to incite immediate action, are generally used for lead generation.</p> \n<p>When you give your Facebook ad landing page its own URL, you'll be able to see the leads earned specifically from that ad. Additionally, if you want to make small tweaks for Facebook performance, you can do so without modifying the original page.</p> \n<h3>2. Keep the design free of distractions.</h3> \n<p>As marketers, we know that landing pages should be simple. For Facebook ad landing pages, this is especially true. Your ad goals most likely center around audiences taking action, and a clean landing page supports that.</p> \n<p>If your landing pages outside of Facebook usually include clickable logos and text, remove them for this version. For instance, this landing page on HubSpot's site has a clickable logo and text. The Facebook version, however, doesn't. It distracts from the overall purpose of the ad.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/The%20Ins%20and%20Outs%20of%20Facebook%20Landing%20Pages-Jul-29-2020-08-49-32-20-PM.png\" alt=\"Example of a HubSpot offer landing page.\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n</div> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'times new roman', times;\"><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/social-media-content-calendar\">Image Source</a></span></p> \n<p>When you're designing your landing page, use the page space to make CTAs visible. Copy should succinctly reflect what's being advertised on Facebook. For instance, the Facebook landing page above leverages branding, large fonts and photos, and an actionable button.</p> \n<h3>3. Create according to your ad goals.</h3> \n<p>When you create a Facebook ad, you have to choose an ad type. These ad types reflect the ultimate goal of your campaign, like lead generation. Your landing page should be designed according to that campaign objective to maximize their effectiveness.</p> \n<p>A landing page should be made with a purpose in mind. For example, a brand awareness ad can be broad — it's just introducing audiences to a company. However, a page for conversions should specifically lead viewers to download the ebook or demo.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/The%20Ins%20and%20Outs%20of%20Facebook%20Landing%20Pages-3.png\" alt=\"Example of a HubSpot form on a landing page.\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n</div> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'times new roman', times;\"><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.es/demo-hspd\">Image Source</a></span></p> \n<p>This landing page, for instance, has the form at the top of the page to help grow conversions. There's little room for distraction — the only interaction available is filing out the form.</p> \n<h3>4. Add the Pixel feature for optimization.</h3> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/learn/facebook-ads-pixel\">Pixel</a> is a Facebook feature that was designed to boost ad performance. Adding Pixel to your ads is like adding an extra targeting feature.</p> \n<p>Let's say a 35-year-old woman in an urban area clicked on the landing page and completed an offer for a brand awareness ad. Facebook then tells Pixel to suggest the ad to profiles with similar demographics in order to reach more qualified leads.</p> \n<p>Essentially, Pixel targets audience members based on the demographic information of people who've previously interacted with the ad, and increases the amount of traffic your landing page earns.</p> \n<h3>5. Track the right metrics.</h3> \n<p>If you want to track landing page performance, make sure you're looking at the right metrics. Facebook will offer you an analytics report based on your ad type, and there's a few you can attribute to the landing page.</p> \n<p>Ondracek recommends looking at the amount of money spent, forms filled, and conversions. Staying in budget for your ad campaign is a no-brainer. The amount of forms completed lets you know if your form was effective for converting leads, and conversions shows you how many.</p> \n<p>When tracking performance outside of Facebook, add <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-are-utm-tracking-codes-ht?_ga=2.166164855.831801315.1596056938-940436819.1565181751\">UTM parameters</a>. This is basically a special tag on a URL that'll track page performance. UTM codes can be imported into analytics software, like Google and Looker.</p> \n<p>You don't have to track landing pages using different services. However, if you made your page using marketing automation software that offers analytics, they're worth keeping in mind. Additionally, UTM codes will give you analytics you can compare with Facebook and other software.</p> \n<p>Having multiple sources of data, Ondracek recommends, gives you a more holistic view of landing page performance.</p> \n<h3>6. Test landing pages frequently.</h3> \n<p>Test your landing page before it goes live, if possible. If you used software that offers testing features, use them to test the effectiveness of your page. Even though it won't be connected to Facebook, you can make small changes before uploading based on test results.</p> \n<p>\"We build landing pages using HubSpot, so we use the A/B testing feature before and while we use the page. We choose one thing to tweak at a time to keep results accurate. Over time, we'll build the most effective Facebook landing pages possible,\" says Ondracek.</p> \n<p>You don't have to use specific software to test your landing page. You can even use Facebook's A/B testing feature for ads. If you decide to go that route, make your ad goal conversions so landing page design will be a factor.</p> \n<p>When created for your audience, Facebook landing pages can be an awesome tool. They jumpstart buying journeys, earn leads, and expand reach. When you track their performance, you can learn more insights about how customers interact with your company on Facebook.</p> \n<p>Use landing pages to further inform and delight your audience. I, for one, love a good landing page, and will be looking forward to seeing yours on my Facebook timeline next.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fcreate-landing-page-on-facebook&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 30 Jul 2020 08:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/The%20Ins%20and%20Outs%20of%20Facebook%20Landing%20Pages.gif","linkMd5":"e8719fcdd9dc788039d8b8486a3df067","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn53@2020_2/2020-07-30/1596118301765_650618d0d313130f.webp","author":"Kayla Carmicheal","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/The%20Ins%20and%20Outs%20of%20Facebook%20Landing%20Pages.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn53@2020_2/2020-07-30/1596118301765_650618d0d313130f.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/The%20Ins%20and%20Outs%20of%20Facebook%20Landing%20Pages-Jul-29-2020-08-49-32-45-PM.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn69@2020_6/2020-07-30/1596118306082_f5b180d0cd562388.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/The%20Ins%20and%20Outs%20of%20Facebook%20Landing%20Pages-4.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn21@2020_2/2020-07-30/1596118309245_11a9d43c910f2464.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/The%20Ins%20and%20Outs%20of%20Facebook%20Landing%20Pages-1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn21@2020_5/2020-07-30/1596118307330_e60e80519bc01967.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/The%20Ins%20and%20Outs%20of%20Facebook%20Landing%20Pages-2.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn34@2020_1/2020-07-30/1596118310125_659c783dd2eea091.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/The%20Ins%20and%20Outs%20of%20Facebook%20Landing%20Pages.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn13@2020_4/2020-07-30/1596118307282_d1fbb69bdea4a485.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/The%20Ins%20and%20Outs%20of%20Facebook%20Landing%20Pages-Jul-29-2020-08-49-32-71-PM.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn18@2020_4/2020-07-30/1596118309967_3333ee5d858bb6e8.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/The%20Ins%20and%20Outs%20of%20Facebook%20Landing%20Pages-Jul-29-2020-08-49-32-20-PM.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn25@2020_6/2020-07-30/1596118313420_fe30f99aeaba41ba.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/The%20Ins%20and%20Outs%20of%20Facebook%20Landing%20Pages-3.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn29@2020_2/2020-07-30/1596118310836_9df43ef6f39c9120.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fcreate-landing-page-on-facebook&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn77@2020_6/2020-07-30/1596118307936_fc76b5e57c7bbeb7.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-07-30 22:11:40","updatedTime":"2020-07-30 14:11:40","title":"How to Do Keyword Research for SEO: A Beginner's Guide","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-do-keyword-research-ht","description":"<p>While Google keeps us on our toes with all the <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/major-google-algorithm-updates-2014\">algorithm updates</a> they keep rollin' out, one thing has stayed pretty consistent for inbound marketers looking to optimize their websites for search: keyword research.</p> \n<p>Well, the need to <em>do </em>keyword research has stayed the same. How you actually do it hasn't.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h2>What Is Keyword Research?</h2> \n<p>Keyword research is the process of finding and analyzing search terms that people enter into search engines with the goal of using that data for a specific purpose, often for search engine optimization (SEO) or general marketing. Keyword research can uncover queries to target, the popularity of theses queries, their ranking difficulty, and more.</p> \n<div class=\"hsg-featured-snippet\"> \n <h2>Why Is Keyword Research Important?</h2> \n <p>Keyword research provides valuable insight into the queries that your target audience is actually searching on Google. The insight that you can get into these actual search terms can help inform content strategy as well as your larger marketing strategy. However, keywords themselves may not be as important to SEO as you may think.</p> \n</div> \n<p>More and more, we hear how much <a href=\"https://searchengineland.com/the-evolution-of-an-seo-246875\">SEO has evolved</a> over just the last 10 years, and how unimportant keywords themselves have become to our ability to rank well for the searches people make every day.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>And to some extent, this is true; using keywords that exactly match a person's search is no longer the most important ranking factor in the eyes of an SEO professional. Rather, it's the <em>intent</em> behind that keyword, and whether or not a piece of content solves for that intent (we'll talk more about intent in just a minute).</p> \n<p>But that doesn't mean keyword research is an outdated process. Let me explain:</p> \n<p>Keyword research tells you what topics people care about and, assuming you use the right <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/seo-analysis-tools\">SEO tool</a>, how popular those topics actually are among your audience. The operative term here is <strong>topics</strong> -- by researching keywords that are getting a high volume of searches per month, you can identify and sort your content into topics that you want to create content on. Then, you can use these topics to dictate which keywords you look for and target.</p> \n<div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"width: 100%; height: auto; position: relative; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; max-width: 560px; max-height: 380px; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\"> \n <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 67.86%; margin: 0;\">\n  <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xOGxyw9DSa8?autoplay=0&amp;fs=0&amp;iv_load_policy=3&amp;showinfo=0&amp;rel=0&amp;cc_load_policy=0&amp;start=0&amp;end=0&amp;origin=https://youtubeembedcode.com\" width=\"560\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n </div> \n</div> \n<p>By <a href=\"https://www.growthmarketingpro.com/growthbar\">researching keywords</a> for their popularity, search volume, and general intent, you can tackle the questions that the most people in your audience want answers to.</p> \n<h2>How to Research Keywords for Your SEO Strategy</h2> \n<p>I'm going to lay out a keyword research process you can follow to help you come up with a list of terms you should be targeting. That way, you'll be able to establish and execute a strong keyword strategy that helps you get found for the search terms you actually care about.</p> \n<h3>Step 1: Make a list of important, relevant topics based on what you know about your business.</h3> \n<p>To kick off this process, think about the topics you want to rank for in terms of generic buckets. You'll come up with about 5-10 topic buckets you think are important to your business, and then you'll use those topic buckets to help come up with some specific keywords later in the process.</p> \n<p>If you're a regular blogger, these are probably the topics you blog about most frequently. Or perhaps they're the topics that come up the most in sales conversations. Put yourself in the shoes of your <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/free-template-creating-buyer-personas\">buyer personas</a> -- what types of topics would your target audience search that you'd want your business to get found for? If you were a company like HubSpot, for example -- selling <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products\">marketing software</a> (which happens to have some awesome <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/seo\">SEO tools</a>... but I digress), you might have general topic buckets like:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>\"inbound marketing\" (21K)</li> \n <li>\"blogging\" (19K)</li> \n <li>\"email marketing\" (30K)</li> \n <li>\"lead generation\" (17K)</li> \n <li>\"SEO\" (214K)</li> \n <li>\"social media marketing\" (71K)</li> \n <li>\"marketing analytics\" (6.2K)</li> \n <li>\"marketing automation\" (8.5K)</li> \n</ul> \n<p>See those numbers in parentheses to the right of each keyword? That's their <strong>monthly search volume</strong>. This data allows you to gauge how important these topics are to your audience, and how many different sub-topics you might need to create content on to be successful with that keyword. To learn more about these sub-topics, we move onto step 2 ...</p> \n<h3>Step 2: Fill in those topic buckets with keywords.</h3> \n<p>Now that you have a few topic buckets you want to focus on, it's time to identify some keywords that fall into those buckets. These are keyword phrases you think are important to rank for in the SERPs (search engine results pages) because your target customer is probably conducting searches for those specific terms.</p> \n<p>For instance, if I took that last topic bucket for an inbound marketing software company -- \"marketing automation\" -- I'd brainstorm some keyword phrases that I think people would type in related to that topic. Those might include:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>marketing automation tools</li> \n <li>how to use marketing automation software</li> \n <li>what is marketing automation?</li> \n <li>how to tell if I need marketing automation software</li> \n <li>lead nurturing</li> \n <li>email marketing automation</li> \n <li>top automation tools</li> \n</ul> \n<p>And so on and so on. The point of this step isn't to come up with your final list of keyword phrases. You just want to end up with a brain dump of phrases you think potential customers might use to search for content related to that particular topic bucket. We'll narrow the lists down later in the process so you don't have something too unwieldy.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Although more and more <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/google-encrypting-all-searches-nj?_ga=2.176251430.2045574748.1559048740-983944916.1546275206\">keywords are getting encrypted</a> by Google every day, another smart way to come up with keyword ideas is to figure out which keywords your website is <em>already</em> getting found for. To do this, you'll need website analytics software like Google Analytics or HubSpot's Sources report, available in the <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/analytics?_ga=2.181062820.2045574748.1559048740-983944916.1546275206\">Traffic Analytics tool</a>. Drill down into your website's traffic sources, and sift through your organic search traffic bucket to identify the keywords people are using to arrive at your site.</p> \n<p>Repeat this exercise for as many topic buckets as you have.&nbsp;And remember, if you're having trouble coming up with relevant search terms, you can always head on over to your&nbsp;customer-facing colleagues&nbsp;-- those who are in Sales or Service -- and ask them what types of terms their prospects and customers use, or common questions they have. Those are often great starting points for keyword research.</p> \n<h3>Step 3: Understand How Intent Affects Keyword Research and Analyze Accordingly.</h3> \n<p>Like I said in the previous section, <strong>user intent</strong> is now one of the most pivotal factors in your ability to rank well on search engines like Google. Today, it's more important that your web page addresses the problem a searcher <em>intended</em> to solve than simply carries the keyword the searcher used. So, how does this affect the keyword research you do?</p> \n<p>It's easy to take keywords for face value, and unfortunately, keywords can have many different meanings beneath the surface. Because the intent behind a search is so important to your ranking potential, you need to be extra-careful how you interpret the keywords you target.</p> \n<p>Let's say, for example, you're researching the keyword \"how to start a blog\" for an article you want to create. \"Blog\" can mean a blog <em>post</em> or the blog website itself, and what a searcher's intent is behind that keyword will influence the direction of your article. Does the searcher want to learn how to start an individual blog post? Or do they want to know how to actually launch a website domain for the purposes of blogging? If your content strategy is only targeting people interested in the latter, you'll need to make sure of the keyword's intent before committing to it.</p> \n<p>To verify what a user's intent is in a keyword, it's a good idea to simply enter this keyword into a search engine yourself, and see what types of results come up. Make sure the type of content Google is closely related to what you'd intend to create for the keyword.</p> \n<h3>Step 4: Research related search terms.</h3> \n<p>This is a creative step you may have already thought of when doing keyword research. If not, it's a great way to fill out those lists.</p> \n<p>If you're struggling to think of more keywords people might be searching about a specific topic, take a look at the related search terms that appear when you plug in a keyword into Google. When you type in your phrase and scroll to the bottom of Google's results, you'll notice some suggestions for searches related to your original input. These keywords can spark ideas for other keywords you may want to take into consideration.</p> \n<img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-2544681448-jpg/00-Blog-Related_Images/related-searches.jpg?width=550&amp;name=related-searches.jpg\" alt=\"Related searches at the bottom of Google SERP that reads &quot;searches related to cute puppies&quot; along with keyword suggestions\" width=\"550\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"> \n<p>Want a bonus? Type in some of those related search terms and look at <em>their</em> related search terms.</p> \n<h3>Step 5: Use keyword research tools to your advantage.&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>Keyword research and SEO tools such as <a href=\"https://ahrefs.com/\">Ahrefs</a>, <a href=\"https://www.semrush.com/\">SEMrush</a>, and <a href=\"https://neilpatel.com/ubersuggest/\">Ubersuggest</a> can help you come up with more keyword ideas based on exact match keywords and phrase match keywords based on the ideas you've generated up to this point. This exercise might give you alternatives that you might not have considered.</p> \n<h2>How to Find and Choose Keywords for Your Website</h2> \n<p>Once you have an idea of the keywords that you want to rank for, now it's time to refine your list based on the best ones for your strategy. Here's how:&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>Step 1. Understand the three main factors for choosing good keywords.</h3> \n<p>Before choosing keywords and expecting your content to rank for them, you must curate keywords for three things:&nbsp;</p> \n<h4>1. Relevance</h4> \n<p>Google ranks content for relevance. This is where the concept of search intent comes in. Your content will only rank for a keyword if it meets the searchers' needs. In addition, your content must be the best resource out there for the query. After all, why would Google rank your content higher if it provides less value than other content that exists on the web?</p> \n<h4>2. Authority</h4> \n<p>Google will provide more weight to sources it deems authoritative. That means you must do all you can to become an authoritative source by enriching your site with helpful, information content and promoting that content to earn social signals and backlinks. If you're not seen as authoritative in the space, or if a keyword's SERPs are loaded with heavy sources you can't compete with (like Forbes or The Mayo Clinic), you have a lower chance of ranking unless your content is exceptional.&nbsp;</p> \n<h4>3. Volume</h4> \n<p>You may end up ranking on the first page for a specific keyword, but if no one ever searches for it, it will not result in traffic to your site. Kind of like setting up shop in a ghost town.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Volume is measured by MSV (monthly search volume), which means the number of times the keyword is searched per month across all audiences.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>Step 2: Check for a mix of head terms and long-tail keywords in each bucket.</h3> \n<p>If you don't know the difference between head terms and long-tail keywords, let me explain. Head terms are keywords phrases that are generally shorter and more generic -- they're typically just one to three words in length, depending on who you talk to. <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/definition-long-tail-keyword-100-words-sr\">Long-tail keywords</a>, on the other hand, are longer keyword phrases usually containing three or more words.</p> \n<p>It's important to check that you have a mix of head terms and long-tail terms because it'll give you a keyword strategy that's well balanced with long-term goals and short-term wins. That's because head terms are generally searched more frequently, making them often (not always, but often) much more competitive and harder to rank for than long-tail terms. Think about it: Without even looking up search volume or difficulty, which of the following terms do you think would be <strong>harder</strong> to rank for?</p> \n<ol> \n <li>how to write a great blog post</li> \n <li>blogging</li> \n</ol> \n<p>If you answered #2, you're absolutely right. But don't get discouraged. While head terms generally boast the most search volume (meaning greater potential to send you traffic), frankly, the traffic you'll get from the term \"how to write a great blog post\" is usually more desirable.</p> \n<p>Why?</p> \n<p>Because someone who is looking for something <em>that</em> specific is probably a much more qualified searcher for your product or service (presuming you're in the blogging space) than someone looking for something really generic. And because long-tail keywords tend to be more specific, it's usually easier to tell what people who search for those keywords are <em>really</em> looking for. Someone searching for the head term \"blogging,\" on the other hand, could be searching it for a whole host of reasons unrelated to your business.</p> \n<p>So check your keyword lists to make sure you have a healthy mix of head terms and long-tail keywords. You definitely want some quick wins that long-tail keywords will afford you, but you should also try to chip away at more difficult head terms over the long haul.</p> \n<h3>Step 3: See how competitors are ranking for these keywords.</h3> \n<p>Just because your competitor is doing something doesn’t mean you need to. The same goes for keywords. Just because a keyword is important to your competitor, doesn’t mean it's important to you. However, understanding what keywords your competitors are trying to rank for <em>is</em> a great way to help you give your list of keywords another evaluation.</p> \n<p>If your competitor is ranking for certain keywords that are on your list, too, it definitely makes sense to work on improving your ranking for those. However, don’t ignore the ones your competitors don’t seem to care about. This could be a great opportunity for <strong>you</strong> to own market share on important terms, too.</p> \n<p>Understanding the balance of terms that might be a little more difficult due to competition, versus those terms that are a little more realistic, will help you maintain a similar balance that the mix of long-tail and head terms allows. Remember, the goal is to end up with a list of keywords that provide some quick wins but also helps you make progress toward bigger, more challenging SEO goals.</p> \n<p>How do you figure out what keywords your competitors are ranking for, you ask? Aside from manually searching for keywords in an incognito browser and seeing what positions your competitors are in, Ahrefs allows you to run a number of free reports that show you the top keywords for the domain you enter. This is a quick way to get a sense of the types of terms your competitors are ranking for.</p> \n<h3>Step 4: Use Google's Keyword Planner to cut down your keyword list.</h3> \n<p>Now that you've got the right mix of keywords, it's time to narrow down your lists with some more quantitative data. You have a lot of tools at your disposal to do this, but let me share my favorite methodology.</p> \n<p>I like to use a mix of the <a href=\"https://ads.google.com/home/tools/keyword-planner/\">Google's Keyword Planner</a> (you'll need to set up an Ads account for this, but you can turn your example ad off before you pay any money), and <a href=\"http://www.google.com/trends\">Google Trends</a>.</p> \n<p>In Keyword Planner, you can get search volume and traffic estimates for keywords you're considering. Then, take the information you learn from Keyword Planner and use <a href=\"http://www.google.com/trends/\">Google Trends</a> to fill in some blanks.</p> \n<p>Use the Keyword Planner to flag any terms on your list that have way too little (or way too much) search volume, and don't help you maintain a healthy mix like we talked about above. But before you delete anything, check out their trend history and projections in Google Trends. You can see whether, say, some low-volume terms might actually be something you should invest in now -- and reap the benefits for later.</p> \n<p>Or perhaps you're just looking at a list of terms that is way too unwieldy, and you have to narrow it down somehow ... Google Trends can help you determine which terms are trending upward, and are thus worth more of your focus.</p> \n<h2>Best Keywords for SEO</h2> \n<p>Understand that there's no \"best\" keywords, just those that are highly searched by your audience. With this in mind, it's up to you to craft a strategy that will help you rank pages and drive traffic.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The best keywords for your SEO strategy will take into account relevance, authority, and volume. You want to find highly searched keywords that you can reasonably compete for based on:&nbsp;</p> \n<ol> \n <li>The level of competition you're up against.&nbsp;</li> \n <li>Your ability to produce content that exceeds in quality what's currently ranking.</li> \n</ol> \n<h3>And ... You're done!</h3> \n<p>Congratulations! You've now got a list of keywords that'll help you focus on the right topics for your business, and get you some short-term and long-term gains.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Be sure to re-evaluate these keywords every few months -- once a quarter is a good benchmark, but some businesses like to do it even more often than that. As you gain even more authority in the SERPs, you'll find that you can add more and more keywords to your lists to tackle as you work on maintaining your current presence, and then growing in new areas on top of that.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p> \n<div>\n <a class=\"close\"> </a>\n</div> \n<div>\n <em>Editor's note: This post was originally published in May 2019 and has been updated for comprehensiveness.</em>\n</div>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fhow-to-do-keyword-research-ht&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 22 Jul 2020 18:30:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/keyword-research-3.jpg#keepProtocol","linkMd5":"5102e5ad371d47648d621656b428bc7e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn77@2020_2/2020-07-30/1596118303759_1be133e9cd842be4.webp","metaImg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/keyword-research-3.jpg#keepProtocol","author":"rleist@hubspot.com (Rachel Leist)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-2544681448-jpg/00-Blog-Related_Images/related-searches.jpg?width=550&name=related-searches.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn93@2020_6/2020-07-30/1596118313250_aac921b6abc70c1e.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fhow-to-do-keyword-research-ht&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn9@2020_5/2020-07-30/1596118312421_d44c9afd5450c131.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-07-30 22:11:41","updatedTime":"2020-07-30 14:11:41","title":"The Key Role Technical Marketing Can Play in Content Strategy","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/technical-marketing","description":"<p>Technical marketing is a key aspect of a successful content marketing strategy, particularly if your organization deals with complex products and services.</p> \n<p>But it can be difficult when your marketers don't have a firm understanding of the technical aspects behind your product.</p> \n<p>Without technical expertise, your marketing team likely has a difficult time executing on content that will resonate with your core audience and — ultimately — turning readers into customers.</p> \n<p>In this blog, we'll take a look at why technical marketing is so important, as well as the skills necessary to successfully implement it as part of your wider marketing strategy.</p> \n<p>But first, let's take a look at what technical marketing actually <i>is.</i></p> \n<p><i></i></p> \n<h2><strong>What is technical marketing?</strong></h2> \n<p>Technical marketing may be a confusing term, with differing definitions.</p> \n<p>In more recent times, it has been used to reference the technology increasingly used in the marketing industry.</p> \n<p>Historically, however, it refers to a specific type of marketing that focuses primarily on the specifications and, of course, 'technical' aspects of a product or service. It's this second understanding that we will be focusing on.</p> \n<p>This type of marketing centers on exactly <i>how</i> a product or service works, and therefore the detail of exactly <i>how</i> it will benefit the user. This is typically more necessary in technical fields where the products are more complex such as engineering electronics, and equally in other complex areas such as finance.</p> \n<h3><strong>Why is technical marketing important?</strong></h3> \n<p>Technical marketing is a crucial part of any marketing strategy, particularly when consumers are very knowledgeable about the subject matter and have a detailed understanding of the product or service.</p> \n<p>More generalist marketing, and providing more of an 'overview' of a product, is not likely to cut it with these consumers — they require more in-depth information. Technical marketing is therefore a necessary component of content strategy, in order to engage, attract, and delight a more technical audience.</p> \n<p>Since <a href=\"https://twitter.com/searchliaison/status/973241540486164480\">Google's Medic Update</a>, there's been a huge spotlight on <strong>EAT</strong>-ing, or content that demonstrates <strong>E</strong>xpertise, <strong>A</strong>uthority &amp; <strong>T</strong>rust.</p> \n<p>Positioning content that covers technical aspects of a service or product, then, should also help to improve rankings… if it's done properly.</p> \n<p>So, technical marketing is clearly a key part of your marketing strategy. But how do you achieve it?</p> \n<h2><strong>Technical Marketing Skills</strong></h2> \n<p>To successfully incorporate technical marketing into your content strategy, there are some key skills that your technical marketing team will need to hone.</p> \n<p>Let's break this down into content marketing as a whole, qualities required of a technical marketing manager, and those of a technical marketing writer.</p> \n<h3><strong>Technical Content Marketing</strong></h3> \n<p>Technical content marketing should play just as big of a role in your content strategy as any other marketing activity.</p> \n<p>Marketing is all about understanding your audience's needs and pain points, and navigating them towards a useful solution. Yet typically, this form of marketing will require an even greater dose of creativity, with a need to continually search for new avenues to make technical and complex products and services fascinating, and arrive in the hands of the right people.</p> \n<p>To incorporate technical content marketing into content planning and wider strategy, we've put together some key considerations and essentials:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Targeting a range of areas.</strong> Considered purchases such as those that require technical marketing might need content targeting multiple stakeholders, and various pain points, if your product affects several business areas. For instance, sales-driven technical content, marketing, accounts etc. For this reason, you'll have to really contextualize and hone in on your personas pain points, and how best to approach them.</li> \n <li><strong>Targeted content offers.</strong> Talking about in-depth topics through different content platforms and communicating about the product in a more thorough manner assumes a level of knowledge with prospects, thereby attracting a better fit and more qualified visits to your website. Consider technical readouts, product demos, user manuals, setup checklists, training materials, or online courses. Technical video tends to be a great format, but you'll need to judge what works best for your market!</li> \n <li><strong>Think about all of the buyer's journey stages. </strong>Come up with consideration and decision-stage content or flesh out personas based on common specification questions. Case studies on specific use cases and scenarios will help build trust and establish fit, and help consumers to better weigh up the product or service. And don't forget the delight stage content! Improve the retention of your products and services, and create real brand advocates through FAQ's, How-to's, and videos.</li> \n <li><strong>\"Versus\" and \"Or\".</strong> You need to understand and cater to comparison-focused searches such as \"versus\" and \"or\" in your content planning. \"Your product vs. competitor product\" is a key stage in the consideration phase of your prospective buyer's journey. For example, prospective TV buyers might search for \"OLED vs. QLED model benefits\".</li> \n <li><strong>Think about how you can upsell. </strong>If customers are engaging with advice and help-driven content, you may be able to identify opportunities to upsell! For example, if an existing customer views or downloads information on higher product tiers, or functionality available in paid add-ons, your sales team might reach out to discuss potential upgrades.</li> \n <li><strong>Work backwards. </strong>This may sound counterintuitive, but start from the feature. You're probably used to the following formula: persona &gt; pain point &gt; search term research &gt; advice-driven content &gt; relevant product or service. Yet, if this starting information isn't available to you, or your personas pain points aren't well-defined, you can reverse engineer the process. For instance, let's say you're a <a href=\"https://www.noisylittlemonkey.com/hubspot/partner-agency\">HubSpot Partner</a> and you want to better promote the chatbot software to your SaaS personas … you may write content about how automating routine support questions improves service team response times. This way, you can target your content around the product in the most helpful way.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3><strong>Technical Marketing Manager</strong></h3> \n<p>So what does it take to be a technical marketing manager and to implement all of the above into your content marketing strategy? There are certainly some key characteristics necessary to this role, and some definite skills to hone. Here are some of the most important aspects to consider:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Public speaking skills.</strong> This may be unexpected, but it's an incredibly important skill in technical marketing, as part of a wider content marketing strategy. Given that the content that tends to perform well are conferences, video, and presentations, a technical marketing manager must be able to communicate technical aspects in this thought leadership setting.</li> \n <li><strong>Training skills. </strong>Similarly, another content form that lends itself well to this style of marketing is training courses on the products and services offered. Great training skills are therefore necessary, both for online and in-person technical training.</li> \n <li><strong>Big picture view.</strong> It's essential that a technical marketing manager has wider business knowledge, to understand the ROI for the specific product, as well as the product's use cases. Wider industry knowledge is also a must, with an understanding of complementary or substitute products on the market. For example, if you think about your prospect's existing subscriptions or tool stack, a detailed overview of the specifications and limitations of your product will highlight where your offering will complement or overlap with their existing tools.</li> \n <li><strong>Deal with objections.</strong> With more involvement in business operations, your concrete understanding of your product's specifications will be necessary to better explain where the features are adding value.</li> \n <li><strong>Problem-solving</strong>. Ultimately, marketing is all about helping consumers solve their problems. It's therefore important to be consultative and empathetic, allowing you to explore and further advise prospect's decision-making processes by continually looking at specific needs, and aligning features and uses of the product to this.</li> \n <li><strong>An honest and understanding approach. </strong>As well as being empathetic, it's also important to be helpful so that prospects make the most informed decisions on product fit and commitment. Consider questions like, <i>'Does the service offering tick all their boxes? How much time and money will they need to commit to adopt your product?'</i></li> \n</ul> \n<p>Ultimately, all of this comes down to the technical marketing manager's strategic planning ability. It's not just about all of this information that you've gathered from the industry and personas, but what you <i>do </i>with it.</p> \n<p>You have to think about how best to engage a technical audience, which takes real time, planning, and market research, as well as how this may fit in with wider business goals.</p> \n<h3><strong>Technical Marketing Writer</strong></h3> \n<p>So we've looked at how you incorporate technical marketing into your strategy, as well as who's responsible for the overarching goals, but we're forgetting one exceptionally key piece of the puzzle: the technical marketing writer.</p> \n<p>A technical marketing writer has a real responsibility to commit these ideas to paper (or video, as the case may be). Their content will be the driving force behind better qualified leads.</p> \n<p>Here are a few aspects of content you'll want any technical marketing writer to understand:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>The content needs to live and breathe the product or service it's related to, and the audience that desires it. Whether this be through product descriptions, web pages, or more general industry-related content that will drive traffic.</li> \n <li>It's not just a strategist that needs technical knowledge — the writer themselves will need a full understanding of a product or services' USPs, abilities and benefits. And this should outweigh the understanding of the customer — there should be no questions left unanswered.</li> \n <li>Similarly, this technical knowledge is essential for those that are putting pen to paper. They need to have the ability to best showcase the technical data of the product or service to position the company as an expert in the field.</li> \n <li>They'll also need strong research skills to get up-to-date knowledge on wider market trends, as well as the ability to retain and communicate this information to consumers, and showcase it in communication such as newsletters.</li> \n <li>They will, of course, need to be an excellent writer. As we have seen, you need to understand your personas from a content platform perspective, but you'll also need to know <i>how </i>to write for them. This includes tone of voice: is it appropriate to write it simplistically? Or will it be more fitting to include industry jargon?</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Ultimately, technical marketing can be a really important component of your content marketing strategy if your industry or products and services lend themselves to it.</p> \n<p>Technical marketing can help you attract more qualified leads and showcase your company as an expert in the industry. Create a clear technical marketing strategy so that you can cut through the marketing noise, and deliver an exciting and engaging message to your audience.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Ftechnical-marketing&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 30 Jul 2020 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/technical-marketing.jpg#keepProtocol","linkMd5":"116f52f920d63ee6e8a114a2833b6cf3","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn61@2020_4/2020-07-30/1596118303688_647627174d472015.webp","metaImg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/technical-marketing.jpg#keepProtocol","author":"Izzy Green","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Ftechnical-marketing&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn13@2020_5/2020-07-30/1596118304835_cf3dbd424808464e.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-07-30 22:11:40","updatedTime":"2020-07-30 14:11:40","title":"How Marketers Can Leverage WhatsApp’s New Payments Feature","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/whatsapp-payments","description":"<p>Since launching over a decade ago, WhatsApp <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/messaging-app-stats\">has gained popularity all over the world</a>.</p>  \n<p>As the chat app'sglobal user-base has continued to expand, so has its platform. After adding features like <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/brands-on-whatsapp?utm_campaign=Marketing%20Blog%20-%20Daily%20Emails&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email\">group chat and video capabilities</a>, the platform quickly became a place where brands can directly interact with consumers.</p> \n<p>In 2019, due to WhatsApp's booming popularity, it launched one of its biggest features yet:a specialized app called <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/whatsapp-marketing\">WhatsApp Business</a>. This app, which passed<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/messaging-app-stats\"> five million active users</a> in its first year, is quite similar to the consumer version of WhatsApp. However, it allows companies to create a public business profile that includes <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/whatsapp-marketing\">links to ecommerce stores and a catalog of product shots</a>.</p> \n<p>But WhatsApp didn't stop at Business pages. In 2020, the company began rolling out an <a href=\"https://blog.whatsapp.com/bringing-payments-to-whatsapp-for-people-and-small-businesses-in-brazil\">online payment feature</a>. The feature has already launched on the Brazil-based app but will ultimately <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/fact-fiction-seo-quiz\">expand globally</a>.</p> \n<p>According to the brand, the WhatsApp payments tool will allow payments to be accepted by brands with WhatsApp Business pages for a <a href=\"https://blog.whatsapp.com/bringing-payments-to-whatsapp-for-people-and-small-businesses-in-brazil\">3.99% processing fee</a>.</p> \n<p>One of the major reasons WhatsApp's payment feature, powered by <a href=\"https://pay.facebook.com/\">Facebook Pay</a>'s transaction software, is being <a href=\"https://blog.whatsapp.com/bringing-payments-to-whatsapp-for-people-and-small-businesses-in-brazil\">launched in Brazil first</a> is so WhatsApp can learn more about how local benefits can benefit from chat transactions. Prior to this launch, WhatsApp was already one of the <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/messaging-app-stats\">top messaging platforms in Brazil</a> and had already seen <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/brands-on-whatsapp?utm_campaign=Marketing%20Blog%20-%20Daily%20Emails&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email\">a number of brands</a> use it to engage with audiences in this region.</p> \n<p>\"Over 10 million small and micro-businesses are the heartbeat of Brazil’s communities. It’s become second nature to send a zap to a business to get questions answered. Now in addition to viewing a store’s catalog, customers will be able to send payments for products as well. Making payments simple can help bring more businesses into the digital economy, opening up new opportunities for growth,\" a <a href=\"https://blog.whatsapp.com/bringing-payments-to-whatsapp-for-people-and-small-businesses-in-brazil\">blog post from WhatsApp</a> explains.</p> \n<p>Below, I'll walk through how the payments feature works and how brands can leverage it within their WhatsApp or mobile messaging strategies.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h2>How WhatsApp's Payment Feature Works</h2> \n<p>Because the payment feature is powered by <a href=\"https://pay.facebook.com/\">Facebook Pay</a>'s software, sending a payment on WhatsApp will be quite similar to sending one via Facebook.</p> \n<p>To give you a better idea of how the tool will work when it appears on global WhatsApp platforms, I'll start by walking you through what the consumer sees.</p> \n<p>Like <a href=\"https://pay.facebook.com/\">Facebook Pay</a>, WhatsApp users will have to enter their <a href=\"https://blog.whatsapp.com/bringing-payments-to-whatsapp-for-people-and-small-businesses-in-brazil\">MasterCard or Visa information</a> in the settings area of their profile. Users do not need Facebook to use the WhatsApp feature, however, the two companies <a href=\"https://blog.whatsapp.com/bringing-payments-to-whatsapp-for-people-and-small-businesses-in-brazil\">are working on an integration</a> that will enable users also on Facebook Pay to submit one payment method for both platforms, rather than having to enter the same information twice.</p> \n<p>Aside from adding a credit or debit card, users will also need to include information for the bank account which will receive their payments. Currently, to receive or send money, users need an account at <a href=\"https://blog.whatsapp.com/bringing-payments-to-whatsapp-for-people-and-small-businesses-in-brazil\">one of WhatsApp's three Brazilian bank partners</a>. However, as the feature expands to different countries, WhatsApp will be partnering with banks in each new area.</p> \n<p>Once payment information has been added, users can open a chat thread with a friend, go to the message field, and tap a pay button. From there, they can type in the amount they'd like to send, and send it to their contact with no added transaction fees.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20Marketers%20Can%20Leverage%20WhatsApp%E2%80%99s%20New%20Payments%20Feature.png?width=600&amp;name=How%20Marketers%20Can%20Leverage%20WhatsApp%E2%80%99s%20New%20Payments%20Feature.png\" alt=\"WhatsApp payments in whatsapp message threads\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<p style=\"font-size: 10px; text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https://blog.whatsapp.com/bringing-payments-to-whatsapp-for-people-and-small-businesses-in-brazil\">Image Source</a></em></p> \n<p>Before the transaction is finalized, WhatsApp will ask senders <a href=\"https://blog.whatsapp.com/bringing-payments-to-whatsapp-for-people-and-small-businesses-in-brazil\">to confirm their identity</a> with a six-digit pin or fingerprint.</p> \n<p>Although WhatsApp has not gone into great detail about how this feature will look for brands, its <a href=\"https://blog.whatsapp.com/bringing-payments-to-whatsapp-for-people-and-small-businesses-in-brazil\">announcement</a> suggests that shoppers can start a chat with a business -- as they would with a friend, discuss a product or service, and then securely make a purchase directly in the chat.</p> \n<p>Now that you know a bit about how WhatsApp payments will work, here are a few benefits that this feature could offer your business.</p> \n<h2>How Brands Can Benefit From WhatsApp Payments</h2> \n<h3>1. Chatting with customers could result in immediate purchases.</h3> \n<p>Each day, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/conversational-marketing\">conversational marketers</a> and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/community-management-expert-advice\">community managers</a> answer a handful of questions asked in social media posts, comment threads, and direct messages. Meanwhile,<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/digital-selling\"> sales reps</a> might communicate with prospects via email, Slack, WhatsApp, or another form of direct messaging.</p> \n<p>While modern technology has provided a number of ways to communicate with prospects, there can still be a major friction point when the chat ends. After that point, the rep or marketer needs the prospect to venture to an ecommerce site or landing page, fill in their personal information, and buy the product or service. When prospects spend a lot of time chatting with company reps, but ultimately don't buy the product, the time devoted to messaging them can feel like a major waste.</p> \n<p>WhatsApp's payment tool removes some of the friction that comes between a chat and a purchase. Rather than sending a prospect links to your WhatsApp Business catalog or ecommerce site and hoping they click, research the product, add it to their cart, and buy it, you can give them all the information they might need, answer any of their questions, and then offer them the opportunity to purchase a product or service directly in the chat.</p> \n<h3>2. The WhatsApp payment tool offers local businesses new or additional revenue streams.</h3> \n<p>As WhatsApp noted in <a href=\"https://blog.whatsapp.com/bringing-payments-to-whatsapp-for-people-and-small-businesses-in-brazil\">its announcement</a>, consumers in Brazil were already contacting brands, asking them questions, getting product recommendations, and even sending their payment details in chats before WhatsApp added the option to make a full transaction. WhatsApp has also become a common way f<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/brands-on-whatsapp\">or people in Brazil to learn about and interact with local businesses or shops</a> that might not have full ecommerce sites.</p> \n<p>For small and local businesses dabbling in online sales, WhatsApp offers a new revenue stream opportunity that doesn't require them to build a robust online catalog or website. They can now promote their business and current products, chat with prospects, and sell products all from one platform.</p> \n<p>For example, if you own or work as a marketer for a small or local business, especially in a region that heavily uses WhatsApp, creating a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/whatsapp-marketing\">Business account</a> could allow you to promote your brand with a business page and online product catalog. From there, when a user is interested in one of your catalog items, you can begin to experiment with processing online purchases for the first time.</p> \n<p>If you already have an ecommerce site, you can use a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/whatsapp-marketing\">WhatsApp Business account</a> to promote your online store while also using your catalog and chat features to highlight or sell specific items, such as products that are new to the store</p> \n<h3>3. Marketers and brands can better track customer journeys and ROI.</h3> \n<p>Now that customers can learn about a brand, chat with them, and make a purchase directly on WhatsApp, brands can use past threads to learn more about which chats lead to purchases, which don't, and how much ROI they're getting from WhatsApp payments -- even with the service fee.</p> \n<p>As brands tiptoe further into digital transformation, learning about how to reel in and convert customers will be important. Because the entire buyer's journey can now happen on WhatsApp, brands can better get an idea of why consumers convert and what might be knocking them off of a conversion path.</p> \n<p>Similarly, if a brand <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/brands-on-whatsapp?utm_campaign=Marketing%20Blog%20-%20Daily%20Emails&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email\">tests out a marketing campaign on WhatsApp</a>, that company isn't limited to sending online store tracking URLs to determine how successful their marketing content was. If a user who interacts with the WhatsApp campaign also makes a purchase through a private chat, this could also be tracked as ROI.</p> \n<p>On WhatsApp, marketers and sales reps might use chats to get to know the user, inform them of great purchases they could make, and ultimately build the trust needed to convert the person to a customer.</p> \n<p>Although a brand could simply end a chat after a customer makes a payment, they could alternatively check back in with a customer to let them know their package was shipped, check-in to see how the product is working, and inform them of new deals or products they might be interested in later. This method could, in turn, result in upselling, more purchases, and more brand trust.</p> \n<p>If you intend to leverage WhatsApp's payment tool once it's fully launched, keep in mind that there are major benefits to continuing customer relationships rather than just abandoning the chat after you get their money.</p> \n<h2>Bringing the Buyer's Journey to WhatsApp Chat</h2> \n<p>Now that WhatsApp allows users to better discover, learn about, interact with, and pay brands through WhatsApp Business, the platform has brought the buyer's journey fully mobile.</p> \n<p>As a marketer or sales rep, it will be your job to help the prospect with their questions and guide them through the buyer's journey. With the WhatsApp payment feature, you can more smoothly move them from a lead to a customer. Then, you can continue to use the chat and other WhatsApp features to build your brand to customer relationship with them so their buyer's journey and brand trust still continue even after the first purchase.</p> \n<p>To learn more about how to leverage WhatsApp to guide users through the customer funnel, read this post on <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/brands-on-whatsapp\">effective WhatsApp marketing campaigns</a> and this guide to <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/whatsapp-marketing\">WhatsApp for Business</a>.
