It helps to get an idea of what goes trending on this platform to attract audiences.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Check out the trending hashtags and challenges using the Discovery page with the keyword related to your content.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Find the trending songs on the For You page. When the same song repeats more than twice, then add it to your favorites and implement it on your future video.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tip:</strong> When you prepare a video with fun and engaging content, you will definitely get more followers to your account. You can also stand out from the crowd if your video looks interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>#3. Implement <a href=\"https://www.djdesignerlab.com/origin-of-the-hashtag-in-social-media/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"41338\">Hashtags</a> In Your Caption</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Like other social media applications, TikTok also helps to improve content visibility when you add suitable hashtags in your description under each video. When relevant hashtags stream beneath your videos, the chance to get your video stream on the FYP remains higher. Also, the target audiences can see your content when the hashtag is relevant to the target keyword.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1080\" height=\"663\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.djdesignerlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Hashtags-In-Your-Caption.png?resize=1080%2C663&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"7 Amazing TikTok Ideas To Gain Active Followers For Your Brand 2\" class=\"wp-image-42705\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.djdesignerlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Hashtags-In-Your-Caption.png?w=1280&#38;ssl=1 1280w, https://i0.wp.com/www.djdesignerlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Hashtags-In-Your-Caption.png?resize=300%2C184&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.djdesignerlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Hashtags-In-Your-Caption.png?resize=150%2C92&#38;ssl=1 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px\" title=\"7 Amazing TikTok Ideas To Gain Active Followers For Your Brand 7\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two ways to use the hashtags: implementing the generic hashtags like #fyp or #ForYouPage or using the more specific hashtags that suit your content like #beautytips. Since general hashtags have massive competition, using specific hashtags related to your content makes it easier to reach your content among target audiences.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More specific hashtags trending on TikTok are:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>#tiktok</li><li>#duet</li><li>#follow</li><li>#fyp</li><li>#explorepage</li><li>#viral</li><li>#trending</li><li>#foryou</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Along with the hashtags relevant to your content, use any of the above tags to make your content more popular.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>#4. Cross-Promotion Of TikTok Content</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the length of TikTok videos is short, after uploading it on the platform, you can take the same video for publishing on other social media sites like Instagram Reels and Stories, Facebook, Twitter, etc. When you cross-promote your TikTok video with account details, it helps drive higher traffic for your TikTok account. When more traffic for TikTok videos increases from other social sites, it boosts TikTok followers count with a raise in audience engagement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The main advantage of TikTok videos is, users can easily download videos directly from the camera roll. Download the TikTok video by clicking the share icon and tap the Save video. Since your main goal is to increase followers on TikTok, never forget to add a CTA button at the end of your video on other channels to direct audiences to the right place.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>#5. Post Videos At The Perfect Time</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Increase the audience’s interactions on the TikTok platform by posting the content when your followers are active. Know the peak times on TikTok and get more likes, shares, and comments for your interesting video. Come across several accounts related to your niche where you can find the benchmarks on posting content at the best time. Only manual research can provide you with the perfect metrics to post content at the right time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finding the right time to post content on TikTok may take several weeks. Experiment with different post times and track the audience&#8217;s performance on which time the post gets the highest engagement rate.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you use the inbuilt TikTok’s Pro account, you will get detailed analytics on your audience&#8217;s performance for your posts. On the dashboard of the Pro account, you will know the hours and days of your followers when they are active.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Usually, the Pro account displays the analytical data in the UTC timezone. To convert it to time zones and know the most active time of your audiences in the specific location.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>#6. Combine With Influencers</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Influencers are individuals with millions of potential followers spread over all the social media platforms. So, most brands on TikTok combine with influencers to grow their following. Collaborating with influencers is one of the most effective ways to engage audiences with your branded content. The most important part of choosing influencers is, they should be relevant to your niche.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1080\" height=\"608\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.djdesignerlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Influencers.jpg?resize=1080%2C608&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"7 Amazing TikTok Ideas To Gain Active Followers For Your Brand 3\" class=\"wp-image-42706\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.djdesignerlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Influencers.jpg?w=1920&#38;ssl=1 1920w, https://i0.wp.com/www.djdesignerlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Influencers.jpg?resize=300%2C169&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.djdesignerlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Influencers.jpg?resize=150%2C84&#38;ssl=1 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px\" title=\"7 Amazing TikTok Ideas To Gain Active Followers For Your Brand 8\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>When the influencers&#8217; followers and your target audiences are the same, you can gain loyal followers quickly with their authentic content about your brand on their page. Also, give full freedom for influencers you combine to make content on their own to get a better result. Maintaining a good relationship with them could help you to get suggestions and tips for future videos.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Do not combine with influencers just because of a higher followers count. Find the one suitable for your brand growth directly relating to your business. When the influencer gets higher engagement for your brand content, audiences&#8217; attention towards your brand increases.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>#7. Increase Engagement Using UGC Content</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"234\" height=\"215\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.djdesignerlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/UGC-Content.png?resize=234%2C215&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"UGC Content\" class=\"wp-image-42697\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.djdesignerlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/UGC-Content.png?w=234&#38;ssl=1 234w, https://i2.wp.com/www.djdesignerlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/UGC-Content.png?resize=150%2C138&#38;ssl=1 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 234px) 100vw, 234px\" title=\"7 Amazing TikTok Ideas To Gain Active Followers For Your Brand 9\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you want to increase engagement with a rise in followers count? Achieve both goals by publishing user-generated content on your TikTok account. Usually, the potential audiences of your account will create UGC content. When the content from normal TikTok users stream on your account, it helps your brand build trust among potential audiences and may lead to an increase in sales conversions.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Get UGC content by directly approaching your loyal audiences and customers to share the content related to your brand or services. Once they share it on their account, you immediately repost it on your TikTok account by appreciating them. If you are a brand selling services and products, the UGC content helps you increase engagement and increase brand awareness.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Wrapping Up</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Creativity is the most important factor on TikTok to gain the attention of target audiences.
