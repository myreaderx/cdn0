I was at a crossroads&#x2013;whether I wanted to pursue a career in French or if I wanted to do something in engineering. I did dabble in a career that&apos;s related to French, but I realized I was more passionate about technology. That&apos;s when I decided to get my masters, and the rest is history.</p><h3 id=\"what-challenges-did-you-face-on-your-road-to-becoming-an-engineer\">What challenge(s) did you face on your road to becoming an engineer?</h3><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; padding-top: 62.5%;\">\n    <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DLwMAYmopXI\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute; top: 0; height: 100%; width: 100%;\" allow=\"accelerometer; gyroscope; autoplay; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture;\" allowfullscreen=\"true\">\n    </iframe>\n</div><!--kg-card-end: html--><p><br>One [challenge] was understanding the scope of engineering.
