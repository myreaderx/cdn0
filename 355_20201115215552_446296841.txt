Our goal was to expand access to state-of-the-art machine learning tools so anyone could use them.</p>\n  <p>Since then, TensorFlow has become the most popular machine learning library in the world, with over 160 million downloads. Seeing so many people use TensorFlow is an incredible and humbling experience, and we’re thankful for the thousands of people outside of Google who have contributed code, created educational content and organized developer events around the world to support TensorFlow and the growing machine learning community.</p>\n  <p>To celebrate five years of TensorFlow, we’d like to point out a few interactive demos you can try from your browser with a single click, as well as some tutorials that can help you create your own projects. If you’re new to TensorFlow, these are a great way to get a feel for what it can do. And if you like what you see and want to dive a bit deeper, check out the <a href=\"https://blog.tensorflow.org/\">TensorFlow Blog</a>.<br /><br /></p>\n  <h3>Try out some interactive demos powered by machine learning</h3>\n  <p>TensorFlow supports multiple programming languages and environments. Let’s start with a quick tour of JavaScript, and three interactive demos you can try with a click.</p>\n  <p><a href=\"https://blog.tensorflow.org/2018/03/introducing-tensorflowjs-machine-learning-javascript.html\">TensorFlow.js</a> enables you to write and run machine learning models entirely in the browser. This has important applications for privacy preserving applications (no data needs to be sent to a server), and for interactive machine learning programs.&nbsp;</p>One great example of this is this \n  <a href=\"https://blog.tensorflow.org/2020/11/iris-landmark-tracking-in-browser-with-MediaPipe-and-TensorFlowJS.html\">iris landmark-tracking</a> program which supports hands-free interfaces and assistive technologies; you can \n  <a href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/tfjs-models/demos/face-landmarks-detection/index.html\">try the model yourself</a> in your browser (be patient—it may take a few moments to load!).\n  <br />\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n <div class=\"article-module h-c-page\">\n  <div class=\"h-c-grid\">\n   <figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \">\n    <img alt=\"Animated gif showing a woman tilting her head and the software tracking this by analyzing her iris.\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/image1_R129cUq.gif\" />\n   </figure>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p>Similarly to eye-tracking, you can also use TensorFlow.js to track <a href=\"https://blog.tensorflow.org/2019/11/handtrackjs-tracking-hand-interactions.html\">hand motions</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n <div class=\"article-module h-c-page\">\n  <div class=\"h-c-grid\">\n   <figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \">\n    <img alt=\"Animated gif showing a hand counting out numbers and the tracking software tracing this movement.\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/image5_TvKma6W.gif\" />\n   </figure>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p>You only need a webcam for both of these demos, and no data leaves your machine.<br /><br /></p>\n  <h3>Train your own model, no coding necessary</h3>\n  <p>You can train your own model (with no coding required) using the <a href=\"https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/\">Teachable Machine</a>. It’s a fast, fun, and easy way to create a machine learning model right in your browser.
