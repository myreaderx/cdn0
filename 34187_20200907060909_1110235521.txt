We aimed to obtain a high specific impulse and an acceleration zone\r\nmoving downstream toward the channel exit to reduce wall sputtering erosion of the walls of the\r\ndischarge channel, hence ensuring an enhanced lifetime. To study the lifetime characteristics of the\r\nhigh specific impulse Hall thruster, a life test was performed on the HEP-140MF thruster for the\r\nfirst time, and performance parameters, such as thrust, specific impulse, and efficiency, were\r\nmeasured. Changes in the performance parameters and evolutions in the surface profiles of the\r\ndischarge channel wall were summarized. The reasons contributing to these changes during the life\r\ntest were analyzed. Moreover, the accelerated life test method was validated on the HEP-140MF.","descriptionType":"text/plain","publishedDate":"Wed, 26 Aug 2020 23:00:00 +0000","feedId":34187,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"154a87ade445573ec1d7a6107b5eb413","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Wei MAO, Nan WU, Yanlin HU, Yan SHEN, Zhaopu YAO, Xuhui LIU and Yanming WEI","publishedOrCreatedDate":1599458949511}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-09-07 14:09:09","updatedTime":"2020-09-07 14:09:09","feedId":34187,"fetchDate":"Mon, 07 Sep 2020 06:09:09 +0000","fetchMs":4031,"handleMs":43554,"totalMs":47594,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":10,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"3793e6bfd414607e5a3772214aeb628d","hostName":"us-022*","requestId":"11f2c8555c034627b4808f14bb7bc932_34187","contentType":"application/xml;charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":0,"bgimgsTotal":0,"bgimgsGithubTotal":0,"articlesImgsTotal":0,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":0,"successGithubMap":{},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-09-07 03:00:49","updatedTime":"2020-09-07 03:00:49","id":34187,"name":"Plasma Science and Technology - latest papers","url":"http://iopscience.iop.org/1009-0630/?rss=1","subscriber":94,"website":null,"icon":"http://iopscience.iop.org/favicon.ico","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx63/cdn61@2020_2/2020/09/07/06-09-08-715_89e2c9662d839ba1.ico","description":"Latest articles for Plasma Science and Technology","weekly":null,"link":"http://iopscience.iop.org"},"noPictureArticleList":[],"tmpCommonImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBodyImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBgImgCdnBytes":0,"extra4":{"start":1599458901922,"total":0,"statList":[{"spend":4036,"msg":"获取xml内容"},{"spend":43554,"msg":"解释文章"},{"spend":0,"msg":"上传封面图到cdn"},{"spend":0,"msg":"正文链接上传到cdn"},{"spend":0,"msg":"修正封面图上传失败重新上传"}]},"extra5":0,"extra6":0,"extra7ImgCdnFailResultVector":[],"extra10_invalidATagHrefValue":{},"extra111_proxyServerAndStatMap":{},"extra12ImgCdnSuccessResultVector":[],"successGithubMap":{},"failGithubMap":{}}
