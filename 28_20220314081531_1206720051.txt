She received \"glowing reviews from her boss,\" as she did every year. It wasn't until she didn't receive a raise, as she had in previous years, that she thought something was amiss.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=\"text-big\">u/DLS3141 shared his feelings on the issue, \"I was completely gobsmacked.

So let's start with the primary, <i>glaring </i>issue here… Sexism and gender discrimination.</span></p><p><span class=\"text-big\">Flip the situation on its head; what would the companies approach be if one of the men's partners earned a high wage? (And how are they sure they don't.) Are they just assuming that the man is always the breadwinner? What is this 1953?&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=\"text-big\">I'd be willing to stake a considerable chunk of cash that they would never use that argument for not giving one of the men a raise, and that makes it a classic case of gender discrimination.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=\"text-big\">Other commenters have raised issues regarding what this would do if a member of the relationship depended on securing financial independence to escape an abusive partner. That is a niche, but still valid, point too. Although, the core of this issue is still that nobody should ever be discriminated against in opportunity or compensation for any reason. Those things should be solely determined by what you bring to the role.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=\"text-big\">Head </span><a href=\"https://failblog.cheezburger.com/tag/antiwork\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"text-big\">here</span></a><span class=\"text-big\">, to our \"antiwork\" tag, for more work stories about people's terrible treatment from their employers.</span></p><p><br><sub>Thumbnail Image: </sub><a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/HNkT0aXEUyQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><sub>Andreea Avramescu</sub></a></p></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/failblog?a=dxMEqcpV2Bc:z7WGPPar1I4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/failblog?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 09 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":28,"bgimg":"https://i.chzbgr.com/original/16600325/h7E26BD69/denied-raise-because-her-husband-makes-too-much-and-the-men-in-the-office-need-it-more-march-9-2022","linkMd5":"96360a5fc04b4e6d8fc15b06cb6d8de6","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn76@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-15-06-193_7cd563f152fff182.webp","destWidth":1200,"destHeight":630,"sourceBytes":129699,"destBytes":71540,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/failblog?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn8@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-14-59-990_ea6d8368e00da69f.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647245699739},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:14:59","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:14:59","title":"Entitled Guy Tries Bullying Woman Out Of Disabled Parking Spot, She Shows Him The Stump","link":"https://cheezburger.com/16580357/entitled-guy-tries-bullying-woman-out-of-disabled-parking-spot-she-shows-him-the-stump","description":"<p><p>It's amazing to see how people change under conditions of resource scarcity.

The language itself, meant to be more demonstrative of the use of a particular word, rather than entertaining or succinct, feels stilted and weird. One excerpt of<a href=\"https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/lex-luthor-took-forty-cakes\">&nbsp;Lex Luthor stealing 40 cakes gained popularity as its own meme</a> because of the inherent absurdity of the whole thing. How dare that bad, bad man take all those cakes. He couldn't possibly eat them all himself.</p><p>This thread posits that Mojo Jojo's letter-writing is directly influenced by this style of over-descriptive educational writing aimed at children.

The problem with that is that no one is perfect. If someone out there is, good luck setting up your tent at the back of that extremely long line to talk to them. For almost all of us, a working relationship is about accepting a person's flaws within reason.

A love of quality memes does, however, identify someone as having particularly excellent taste.</p><p>Memes used to just be cats and burgers, but in these short few decades, they've grown up and become their own machine. So naturally, that machine will of course turn in on itself and start commenting on the fact that it exists. Like an existential crisis, but only a little funnier. Here are memes about making memes, consuming them, and every other part of the meme economy people seem to find themselves participating in. One day there will be a great singularity and everyone will become their own meme, but before that perfect day comes, we have this. So good luck out there, and happy meme-ing.

Between silent gusts of dead leaves, you and your friends decide that maybe it would be a better idea to go home and play video games. You'll never know exactly what you saw that day, or how it got there. But you will think about it some nights when you can't get to sleep. And all of it happened at 1 pm in broad daylight.</p><p>Sure, nighttime makes things creepy, but at least things are <em>supposed </em>to be creepy at night.</p><p>For some more mysterious tales, here are <a href=\"https://cheezburger.com/16141317/creepy-things-people-witnessed-home-alone\">creepy things people witnessed home alone.</a></p></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/failblog?a=lnX8qsJxqvs:qegJkrkKhjI:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/failblog?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Mon, 07 Mar 2022 19:00:00 +0000","feedId":28,"bgimg":"https://i.chzbgr.com/thumb1200/16579845/hA556CC2E/strange-creepy-things-people-witnessed","linkMd5":"11afa665c153cdf61b92e20df05a623b","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn43@2020_3/2022/03/14/08-15-00-503_6662263753414191.webp","destWidth":1200,"destHeight":630,"sourceBytes":96863,"destBytes":51400,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/failblog?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn8@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-14-59-990_ea6d8368e00da69f.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647245699749},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:14:59","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:14:59","title":"25 Blursed Images Of Concerning Hilarity","link":"https://cheezburger.com/16598277/25-blursed-images-of-concerning-hilarity","description":"<p><p><a href=\"https://cheezburger.com/16011525/blessed-images-to-brighten-up-that-big-ol-day\">Blessed images</a> and <a href=\"https://cheezburger.com/14657541/cursed-creepy-and-weird-images-from-the-abyss\">cursed images</a>.

It is a happy medium between freakishly terrifying and feel-good. It could still be cute, it could still be awful, but it as that extra little push into the absurd.

It would strike most people as unreasonable to not take this fact of life into account. Maybe this is one of those reminders that communication is important in any relationship.

But at the same time, the husband has recently made a few changes to his life that have resulted in a weight gain of about 10 pounds in 5 months. To many people out there, this feels a little ridiculous, but not to OP. She's pretty clear on how unacceptable this change is to her, and asked the internet to put in their two cents.</p><p>Well the internet did, and the consensus is pretty clear.
