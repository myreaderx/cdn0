(Aleksandar Langer/Unsplash/)</caption><p>Witnessing a hazy summertime sky in Los Angeles, you might be tempted to blame the cars and trucks that teem on the region’s roadways. And that’s mostly right, but an increasing share of air pollution is coming from the stuff below those vehicles: asphalt.</p><p>A new study published <a href=\"https://advances.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abb9785\">yesterday in <i>Science Advances</i></a> finds that asphalt pavement and roofing give off lots of gases that go on to form air pollutants. In summertime, asphalt in cities might contribute more to pollutants called secondary organic aerosols than cars and trucks.</p><p>A large chunk of the fine particulate matter pollution in urban areas—ranging from 20 to 70 percent—is secondary organic aerosols, or SOAs. Though air pollution <a href=\"https://www.popsci.com/story/environment/air-pollution-gains-slow-report-2018/\">vastly improved in recent decades</a>—thanks largely to technology and policy aimed at motor vehicles—it remains a problem in many large cities. Parts of Southern California, for example, still can’t meet EPA standards for fine particulate matter.</p><p>As aerosol pollution from vehicles has declined, the relative contribution from other sources has grown. Atmospheric scientists have measured a gap between emissions from known polluters on the ground and the actual pollution in the air. “Atmospheric scientists and air quality managers have been on the hunt for ‘missing [secondary organic compound] sources’ for decades,” Jessica Gilman, a tropospheric chemist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, wrote in an email to <i>Popular Science</i>. “It’s labeled as a ‘missing’ source because we have generally observed more SOA mass than what we know can be formed from the typical/traditional precursor/ingredients.”</p><p>Drew Gentner, a chemical and environmental engineer at Yale University, wanted to see how much asphalt contributed to this mysterious mix. If you recall that distinctive tang of fresh pavement, what your nose is picking up is the volatile organic molecules emanating from the petroleum-based material. So, Gilman says, it’s intuitive that asphalt could be a source for those aerosols of unknown origin.</p><p>Gentner and his team put samples of a common asphalt mixture into a furnace and warmed it up through a range of temperatures. They also subjected the pavement to UVA and UVB light—simulating the effect of sunshine. The researchers measured the emissions and types of chemicals gassing off from the pavement chunks.</p><p>Both heating up and bathing asphalt in light spiked the emissions it produced. With heating, emissions doubled as the material warmed from 40 to 60ºC (104 to 140ºF)—a realistic summertime pavement temperature in many urban areas. Sunlight also increased emissions, by almost 300 percent over a sample without light. Heat and sunlight also seem to cause different chemical responses. After a sample had been warmed for nearly two days it was releasing a low but constant amount of volatile compounds, and adding sunlight caused a new spike.</p><p>Next, the researchers calculated what that could mean for a large developed area—Southern California. Using their experimental findings together with known values of asphalt use in the area, they estimated how much all that pavement could be impacting the air. They found that asphalt from roofs and roads may contribute as much secondary organic compounds as all the vehicles in the region on an annual basis.</p><p>To be clear, this finding applied to just one type of pollutant. Cars still add a lot of pollution, and are a dominant source of ozone. But, in urban areas in the summertime, these aerosols from asphalt and other non-vehicle sources contribute to smog. “[Secondary organic compounds] have been of great interest to air quality researchers,” says Gentner. “Especially in the summer and in urban areas, it’s a significant component of smog.”</p><p>This category of pollutants is challenging to understand. Not only do they come from myriad sources—asphalt is a big one, but paints and other products also release the precursor compounds to pollutants—but the chemical reactions that create these secondary compounds are also complex. While there’s been a lot of progress in understanding and reducing vehicle emissions, unraveling non-combustion pollutant pathways remains a major challenge. “If we want to solve our air quality problem, we’re going to need to expand our view to include less traditional sources,” says Allen Robinson, a civil engineer studying fine particulate matter at Carnegie Mellon University, who was not involved in the study.</p><p>“These emission factors and emissions estimates are so essential for understanding air quality and there are many missing sources that we need to get a better understanding of,” adds Eri Saikawa, an environmental scientist at Emory University who was not involved in the research, in an email to <i>Popular Science</i>. “There is still so much that we do not understand about secondary organic aerosols, and these studies are very important to push the field forward.”</p><p>Gentner says that future research could help reveal how different types of asphalt and ways of applying it could reduce emissions. It’s also possible that so-called cool pavements—which use reflective materials to avoid absorbing heat—could reduce the amount of pollutants that form from asphalt.  “It’s clearly something that needs some work,” says Robinson. “We still have 100,000 premature deaths each year in the U.S. from elevated fine particulate levels. If we’re going to make progress on that, we’re going to need to think about these types of sources and how we control them.”</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 03 Sep 2020 10:00:00 +0000","feedId":410,"bgimg":"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/eyYIYi45hc1-Texzf3B3k4OUsnY=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/X2SPDAOHM5ECLCP5O3Y2CYUGSQ.jpg","linkMd5":"aae76952ec38877b95961783d49e720c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn55@2020_4/2020/09/04/16-44-38-716_ca8354c592be9031.webp","destWidth":2703,"destHeight":2171,"sourceBytes":701115,"destBytes":539340,"author":"Ula Chrobak","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/eyYIYi45hc1-Texzf3B3k4OUsnY=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/X2SPDAOHM5ECLCP5O3Y2CYUGSQ.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn55@2020_4/2020/09/04/16-44-38-716_ca8354c592be9031.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599237877735},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 00:44:37","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 00:44:37","title":"Why you should be adding salt to your cocktails ","link":"https://www.popsci.com/story/diy/how-and-why-to-add-salt-to-your-cocktails/","description":"<img alt=\"Salt makes sweet, sour, and umami notes stand out by decreasing the amount of bitterness we can taste.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/qbZszpeysBCdvKk-FxQyP9KVqxE=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/TYEOKNTZIJRNMXYTNXBIPIYIAE.jpg\" width=\"2000\"/><br/><caption>Salt makes sweet, sour, and umami notes stand out by decreasing the amount of bitterness we can taste.

And a drink doesn’t necessarily have to fall into the savory category to benefit from a pinch.

Bartenders around the world are incorporating the mineral in various forms to enhance more delicate flavors in their concoctions.</p><p>“As in food, a pinch of salt can greatly enhance the overall flavor experience of a drink,” says Alex Smith, the bar manager at <a href=\"http://cecconisdumbo.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Cecconi’s Dumbo</a> in Brooklyn. “Salt can help bring balance of flavor to a cocktail,” he continues, adding that it brightens sweet and sour notes while reducing bitterness. Smith makes a saline solution with sparkling water instead of tap water—he prefers San Pellegrino for its crisp minerality. Opting for a solution over a salt rim, according to Smith, “allows you to control consistency, ensuring that every sip tastes exactly the same.”</p><p>Salt also stabilizes the proteins in egg whites (which are typically added to <a href=\"https://www.saveur.com/saveur-sour-cocktail-recipe/\" target=\"_blank\">sours</a>, <a href=\"https://www.saveur.com/ramos-gin-fizz/\" target=\"_blank\">fizzes</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.saveur.com/porto-flip-cocktail-recipe/\" target=\"_blank\">flips</a> as a texture enhancer), while subtly activating the taste buds and enticing the drinker to continue sipping. It’s a go-to ingredient for Will Wyatt, the owner of <a href=\"https://www.misterparadisenyc.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Mister Paradise</a> in New York’s East Village––five salted cocktails appear on his current drink list. “Salt makes the back palate water and causes you to experience flavor more intensely,” he says. “I love how it can take any flavor and change how you perceive it.”</p><p>“Salt has become a general and almost indispensable ingredient in the cocktail world,” says award-winning bartender Ryan Chetiyawardana, perhaps best known for London’s <a href=\"https://lyaness.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Lyaness</a>. He and his team keep a glass dasher bottle of saline solution, which calls for one part Maldon sea salt to five parts water, at the bar to season all kinds of cocktails and even make a salted absinthe, for a twist on the <a href=\"https://www.saveur.com/article/Recipes/Hemingway-Special-Cocktail/\">Hemingway Daiquiri</a>.</p><p>Here are three ways to salt your cocktails at home—each bartender-approved technique is sure to give you a new perspective on salt.</p><img alt='&#60;a href=\"/grey-gusano-cocktail-recipe\"&#62;Get the recipe for the Grey Gusano Cocktail »&#60;/a&#62;' data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/9S9JpWWdRVEGwL_rOZW7FDBut8U=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/FO55V3BP5EYF7KMJ5GFUUPLDBQ.jpg\" width=\"1500\"/><br/><caption>&#60;a href=\"/grey-gusano-cocktail-recipe\"&#62;Get the recipe for the Grey Gusano Cocktail »&#60;/a&#62; (Courtesy of Deadshot/)</caption><p>Shake it in</p><p>Start with the easiest method: add a pinch of your favorite salt to any citrusy cocktail before shaking—and don’t be afraid to experiment.

(Amazon /)</caption><p>Modern fitness trackers often try to set themselves apart by adding more advanced hardware and sensors inside. Now, many high-end trackers and smart watches include ECG devices for tracking heart rhythms—one company, Withings, even promises sleep apnea detection in its upcoming wearable.</p><p>Amazon, however, has decided to set its new fitness device apart from the rest by relying heavily on AI algorithms and listening to your voice. <a href=\"https://press.aboutamazon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/introducing-amazon-halo-and-amazon-halo-band-new-service-helps\" target=\"_blank\">The $99 device is called Halo</a> and it has a heart rate monitor inside, as well as an accelerometer, temperature sensor, and no screen all. It tracks the typical fitness stuff you’d expect like steps and pulse trends. But, It also has a pair of microphones, which are important for the device’s most interesting—and so far, controversial—feature, <a href=\"https://blog.aboutamazon.com/devices/a-new-tool-to-help-you-understand-and-improve-your-social-wellbeing\" target=\"_blank\">called Tone</a>.</p><p>When you first set up Halo, it asks you to read a few quotes from classic literature. It uses that information to build a voice profile of how you typically speak. The device will then listen to you as you talk during the day and use an algorithm to give you a positivity score regarding your speech. If it determines that you don’t have enough positivity when you talk, it will give you suggestions about how to cheer up your speech pattern.</p><p>Many people already fear that smart assistants like Amazon’s own Alexa are already listening to everything they say, which makes the prospect of strapping a dedicated listening device to your wrist all day seem dubious. Amazon says that the watch will intermittently listen throughout the day, or you can specifically trigger it to listen for up to 30 minutes by pressing the button. There’s a hardware switch to turn off the microphones completely, but that defeats one of the key functions of the device.</p><p>Amazon has tried to get out ahead of the obvious security concerns involved with Tone. The company claims that all of the speech processing and analysis happens in the app or on the device itself—it never makes its way to the cloud. Once the processing is done, the recording gets deleted and isn’t saved anywhere. That’s a departure from how Alexa works—you can go and listen to recordings of your Alexa requests right now by logging into your Amazon account.</p><p>Even with secure recordings, there’s still the somewhat murky issue of just how the algorithm perceives your speech patterns. Obviously, a person’s speech patterns can change for a variety of reasons, <a href=\"https://www.popsci.com/artificial-intelligence-mental-health/\">whether it’s their mood</a> or a simple stuffed nose.</p><p>Amazon isn’t alone in this department: Grammarly, the online copy editing tool that checks your spelling and grammar as you type, has <a href=\"https://www.grammarly.com/tone\" target=\"_blank\">a similar tone detection service</a> that analyzes the phrases you type and tells you how it perceives your words with a simple emoji. It can rate your typing with qualifiers such as “accusatory,” “formal,” “encouraging,” or “regretful.” Since it’s happening with typing, it’s obviously working on a different level than Amazon’s technology, but it could have a similar effect on guiding how users communicate. The “neutral” rating in Grammarly comes with a straight-faced emoji that looks unimpressed or negative. I have it on right now and it suggests the tone of this post is “concerned,” which isn’t totally inaccurate.</p><p>It’s clear that Amazon plans to expand on its Halo brand more in the future. <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Halo-Fitness-And-Health-Tracker/dp/B07QK955LS/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;linkCode=ll1&#38;tag=popularscience-20&#38;linkId=d6bd99dfb352c4dd8816c49c40c5313d&#38;language=en_US\" target=\"_blank\">The band costs just $99</a>, but it will likely enjoy the regular cycle of deep price cuts that Amazon typically employs in order to bring people into its infrastructure of services. Right now, you can pre-order a Halo for $65, which includes six months of the Halo subscription (typically $3.99 per month).</p><p>Once you’re in the system, Amazon plans to keep users by implementing a health points system, a familiar technique for fitness trackers. You get a base goal of 150 somewhat nebulous points per week. You can earn them by walking, but you can earn more by running. You lose a point for every sedentary hour you spend per day beyond the eight it expects you to spend at your desk. It’s reminiscent of Nike’s Fuel Points from when it made its own fitness tracker.</p><p>Voice tone doesn’t factor into your points total, but the features together put a strong emphasis on encouraging users to shape their behavior around the AI-driven suggestions. It’s not uncommon to feel like you’re letting your fitness tracker down when you don’t hit your goals. Now, your tracker can hear the sadness in your voice when you talk about your failure—and it can give you some AI-based tips on how to sound more chipper.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Sep 2020 14:33:38 +0000","feedId":410,"bgimg":"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/u-e8ApvT5kU1DyKubfTJErfSZY4=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/5HVG3PR2LRAGNPZHIJF6U6MXCU.jpg","linkMd5":"a0c2ae3501a5631a9c4fb8cc3587178b","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn81@2020_3/2020/09/04/16-44-38-545_bea207d0d28ba290.webp","destWidth":3840,"destHeight":2500,"sourceBytes":827150,"destBytes":449978,"author":"Stan Horaczek","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/u-e8ApvT5kU1DyKubfTJErfSZY4=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/5HVG3PR2LRAGNPZHIJF6U6MXCU.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn81@2020_3/2020/09/04/16-44-38-545_bea207d0d28ba290.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599237877737},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 00:44:37","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 00:44:37","title":"Herd immunity alone won’t stop COVID-19.

(Unsplash/)</caption><p>One of the White House’s top medical advisors has recommended that the administration adopt an approach to handling the pandemic that would allow the novel coronavirus to quickly infect massive numbers of people in hopes of reaching herd immunity,<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-coronavirus-scott-atlas-herd-immunity/2020/08/30/925e68fe-e93b-11ea-970a-64c73a1c2392_story.html\"> <i>The Washington Post</i> reported on August 31</a>. The plan, reportedly advocated by Scott Atlas, a neuroradiologist at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution, has drawn swift criticism from infectious disease experts.</p><p>“We’re talking about something that...basically would be relying upon an outbreak that would lead to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Americans,” says William Hanage, an epidemiologist in the Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. “The numbers of people who would be rendered vulnerable to this are surely larger than anybody should be prepared to accept.”</p><p>Herd immunity is the point at which enough people in a population are immune to a disease—whether because they have already recovered from infection or been vaccinated—that the pathogen cannot easily spread through the community and cause new outbreaks. Trying to achieve herd immunity without a vaccine’s help, as Atlas is proposing (though he later denied that he pushed for this measure after <i>The Post</i>’s story was published), would entail lifting social distancing restrictions on businesses and gatherings so the disease could spread among young, healthy people. Meanwhile, other steps would be put in place to protect particularly vulnerable populations. However, the course of action would put truly staggering numbers of people across all age groups at risk of serious illness and death.</p><p>There’s also no evidence that a single sweep of the virus through the population would lead to herd immunity, says Sten Vermund, dean of the Yale School of Public Health.</p><p>“It’s a complete myth that you can just let the epidemic rage, protect the vulnerable, and achieve herd immunity. What may happen is…you fill the hospitals, you fill the morgues, and then the next year it happens again,” he says. “You’re not going to get enough people infected to achieve herd immunity and therefore you’ll have done it all for nothing.”</p><p>Typically, herd immunity is reached when the majority of people in a population are vaccinated. This threshold<a href=\"https://www.popsci.com/story/health/herd-immunity-covid-19-coronavirus/\"> varies depending on the disease</a>; about 95 percent of a population must be vaccinated to control an extraordinarily contagious disease like measles. It’s not certain yet what proportion of the population would have to be immune to COVID-19 to prevent the disease from spreading, Hanage says. He estimates that roughly 50 to 66 percent of the population would have to catch COVID-19 to reach herd immunity without a vaccine.</p><p>There have been<a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html\"> more than 6 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the United States</a> and more than 184,000 deaths. For a country with a population of about 330 million people, this means that herd immunity is still a very long ways off. Even cities that were struck hard at the beginning of the pandemic, such as New York, haven’t reached that point. There may be tiny pockets where enough people have been infected that their family members or neighbors are unlikely to catch the disease, Hanage says. But that doesn’t prevent these people from becoming infected when they venture beyond their homes or city blocks.</p><p>Sweden, a country that imposed only minimal restrictions at the start of the pandemic, similar in some ways to what Atlas is advising, has also not reached herd immunity. Meanwhile, the number of COVID-19 fatalities per million people is<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/01/health/herd-immunity-coronavirus-pandemic-explainer-wellness/index.html\"> much higher in Sweden</a> than in neighboring countries such as Denmark or Norway.</p><img alt=\"Compared to other rich countries, Sweden has had one of the highest death rates so far.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/h5McvPDQcx99u-g978JhTT4xxXY=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/Z3A4A73CBFGJ7P5HBZJU6C42N4.png\" width=\"1080\"/><br/><caption>Compared to other rich countries, Sweden has had one of the highest death rates so far. (Infographic by Sara Chodosh/)</caption><p>“Sweden is one of the most medically privileged and healthcare privileged nations on the planet,” Vermund says. The United States has high rates of heart disease and other conditions that put people at higher risk of becoming seriously ill should they catch COVID-19. Many people in the U.S.<a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30893-X/fulltext\"> face other inequities</a>, including lack of access to health insurance and<a href=\"https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/hsph-in-the-news/covid-19-pandemic-highlights-longstanding-health-inequities-in-u-s/\"> living in areas high in air pollution</a>, that compound their risks. In Sweden, Vermund says, “You don’t have the profound subpopulation of vulnerable individuals that we do in the U.S., so it would have been even worse in the U.S. if we had simply let the epidemic rage.”</p><img alt=\"Sweden has faired much worse than its Scandinavian neighbors.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/yADmrfqOXBzoS9zyAuXgjnb1MrA=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/2KCEHYV5I5GG7FX2FOTX7IANDE.png\" width=\"1080\"/><br/><caption>Sweden has faired much worse than its Scandinavian neighbors. (Infographic by Sara Chodosh/)</caption><p>If the United States actively pursued a herd immunity strategy, many of these vulnerable populations would bear the brunt of the epidemic. “Some of the people who have been most infected in the first surges of this have been people of relatively low socioeconomic status, people who are living in communities or in very crowded settings where it’s difficult for them to socially distance,” Hanage says.</p><p>Recent data released by New York City’s Department of Healthfound that, across the five boroughs, around 27 percent of those tested had antibodies to the novel coronavirus. The one zip code where more than 50 percent of participants tested positive for antibodies was Corona, a predominantly Hispanic neighborhood in Queens where many residents are construction and restaurant workers who could not work remotely during the pandemic,<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/19/nyregion/new-york-city-antibody-test.html\"> <i>The New York Times</i> reported</a> on August 19.</p><p>“A higher proportion of those people who are already vulnerable for other reasons would need to be immune in order to achieve herd immunity for the community,” Hanage says. “That’s disturbing in various ways because it means that you are almost desirous of infection within those groups.”</p><p>COVID-19 also poses a particular risk to older people, and shielding the entire elderly population from infection probably wouldn’t be possible. “It’s really, really hard to keep it within those people who are at minimal risk,” Hanage says.</p><p>Many elderly people live in multigenerational households or nursing homes, raising their risk of exposure to the novel coronavirus. People in long-term care facilities account for<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-nursing-homes.html\"> about 40 percent</a> of deaths related to COVID-19 in the United States. Back in February, an outbreak of the disease<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/covid-19-surges-back-into-nursing-homes-in-coronavirus-hot-spots/2020/08/13/edbff5fe-dd75-11ea-b205-ff838e15a9a6_story.html\"> killed 43 people in a nursing home</a> in Kirkland, Washington. “That was an early warning sign and all of the nursing homes were aware that they might be in trouble,” Vermund says. “And yet we still had astronomical death rates; we still did not succeed in keeping the virus out of the nursing homes.”</p><p>Another problem with allowing COVID-19 to spread rampantly is that while the risk of serious illness or death is far lower among young adults or otherwise healthy people, Hanage says, “It’s also not nil.” Researchers also worry that even people with mild cases of COVID-19 may<a href=\"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/07/brain-fog-heart-damage-covid-19-s-lingering-problems-alarm-scientists\"> experience lingering health problems</a> from the disease. And allowing COVID-19 to run rampant in young people could mean that the disease becomes so prevalent that elective surgeries and medical appointments must be canceled because the risk of transmission is so great, Hanage says.</p><p>There have been several cases where people have been<a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2020/08/28/covid-19-reinfection-implications/\"> infected with COVID-19 a second time</a>, although the implications for herd immunity—such as how common reinfection might be and how contagious people are during their second bout of COVID-19—are not yet clear.</p><p>Regardless, allowing COVID-19 to spread like wildfire is not a viable option. “What we need for herd immunity is a vaccine,” Vermund says. Until one becomes available, we have <a href=\"https://www.popsci.com/story/health/covid-coronavirus-prevention-wash-hands-mask/\">plenty of ways</a> to <a href=\"https://www.popsci.com/story/health/social-distancing-covid-19-spread/\">minimize the spread of COVID-19</a>, including masks, social distancing, spending time outdoors when possible and improving ventilation indoors, and avoiding large groups.</p><p>“Those are classic respiratory disease control measures and that’s what we have to rely on over the next year,” Vermund says.</p><p>There are also new advances such as screening tests that can<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/16/style/does-rapid-covid-testing-work-weddings-parties.html\"> return results within an hour</a> or are<a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2020/08/15/fda-clears-saliva-test-for-covid-19-opening-door-to-wider-testing/\"> inexpensive enough to allow us to track COVID-19 on a much larger scale</a> than has previously been possible in the United States.</p><p>“You can minimize exposure [to COVID-19], minimize risk, and equally get a reasonable amount of things back to, not normal, but closer to normal,” Hanage says. “We’re still not in a great place, but there are things that we can do to improve matters and to keep us going through the months ahead.”</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Sep 2020 18:29:34 +0000","feedId":410,"bgimg":"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/1THl2eBQJ9H0_IzC5oRKTlZXapM=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/KDA4P5PGCVEBNEKPDIAMNA2HTY.jpg","linkMd5":"4d6b5caac9f0518378edb735f629f82c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn63@2020_1/2020/09/04/16-44-38-202_e8a611623243227f.webp","destWidth":1707,"destHeight":1280,"sourceBytes":242383,"destBytes":140260,"author":"Kate  Baggaley","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/1THl2eBQJ9H0_IzC5oRKTlZXapM=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/KDA4P5PGCVEBNEKPDIAMNA2HTY.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn63@2020_1/2020/09/04/16-44-38-202_e8a611623243227f.webp","https://www.popsci.com/resizer/h5McvPDQcx99u-g978JhTT4xxXY=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/Z3A4A73CBFGJ7P5HBZJU6C42N4.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn64@2020_2/2020/09/04/16-45-02-949_3aff6afcc29c678b.webp","https://www.popsci.com/resizer/yADmrfqOXBzoS9zyAuXgjnb1MrA=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/2KCEHYV5I5GG7FX2FOTX7IANDE.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn73@2020_6/2020/09/04/16-45-04-013_a329f8b42c96ee38.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599237877737},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 00:44:37","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 00:44:37","title":"Data on COVID-19 outbreaks in schools was sparse, so this teacher collected it herself","link":"https://www.popsci.com/story/health/school-coronavirus-outbreak-tracker/","description":"<img alt=\"You can search by state to find a list of confirmed COVID-19 cases at public K-12 schools across the US.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" height=\"1414\" src=\"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/9SqRoPBf_yikl5Oahdrl0DHkaDo=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/SR46TQZ3DB6TDD7ZKIM5OPD5GA.jpg\" width=\"2121\"/><br/><caption>You can search by state to find a list of confirmed COVID-19 cases at public K-12 schools across the US.

So she started keeping track herself.</p><p>Now, her database is available on a <a href=\"https://app.smartsheet.com/b/publish?EQBCT=00a2d3fbe4184e75b06f392fc66dca13\">website hosted by the National Education Association</a>. You can search by state to find a list of confirmed COVID-19 cases at public K-12 schools across the US. The tracker provides the number of known cases and deaths for students, teachers, and administrators, as well as a link to a news story where the information originated.</p><p>Morris began keeping tabs of the confirmed cases she stumbled across online on August 6. \"I put in the words 'school, positive,'\" she told <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/08/28/906263926/how-many-coronavirus-cases-are-happening-in-schools-this-tracker-keeps-count?utm_source=facebook&#38;utm_medium=news_tab&#38;utm_content=algorithm\">NPR's Morning Edition</a>. \"I clicked on the news tab and would search the articles from the past week or the past 24 hours and then I would input those articles into my spreadsheet.\"</p><p>After she made her database public, teachers began sharing it, and she started receiving personal anecdotes about cases that hadn't been covered by the news.</p><p>“Based on the anecdotes that people have sent me, there have been tons of schools that have been purposely trying to keep this on the down low,” Morris told NPR. “They will tell the close contacts and maybe the staff, but then they won't publicize it any further than that. So a lot of the submissions I received were screenshots of staff emails or parent emails telling about the case. But then when I went to go find an article about it, there wasn't anything about it.”</p><p>At first, she wasn’t sure if she should include those cases in her spreadsheet, because they weren’t verified by a news organization. But in the end, she decided to add a section for “possible” outbreaks. That section is included on the NEA spreadsheets, and there’s a link to report COVID-19 cases, although you must have a verifying source. “Examples of verifying sources include news articles and district websites/press releases,” the site states. “Only publicly verifiable information is published in our public reports.”</p><p>She handed the project over on August 23 to the NEA, where a team will keep the information up to date. By then, she and volunteers working with her had recorded nearly 4,300 cases at more than 1,000 schools. Florida schools had the most cases, followed by Texas and Georgia.</p><p>This isn’t the first time a private citizen has started a COVID-19 data collection because no publicly available official information exists: Brown University economist Emily Oster started maintaining a tally on <a href=\"https://www.workingmother.com/in-545-daycares-that-stayed-open-less-than-2-percent-kids-got-covid-19\">COVID-19 cases at day cares and camps</a> after she couldn’t find national numbers online. “I held off doing this data collection for a long time thinking, surely, someone else will start doing this and do it better,” <a href=\"https://www.workingmother.com/clusterbomb-catastrophe-disaster-experts-predict-fall-with-grim-consequences-for-working-moms\">she told <i>Working Mother</i></a> in July. “And then they didn’t, and didn’t, and didn’t, and I finally pulled the trigger. But it’s really frustrating that this is how we got to this.

The papers all examine whether steroids are a useful treatment for critically-ill COVID-19 patients, including those who have acute respiratory distress syndrome, or ARDS. The most notable is a meta-analysis of seven existing studies on the subject, sponsored by the World Health Organization. It found a clear signal that COVID-19 patients with ARDS who were treated with corticosteroids had a significantly better chance of surviving, in the short term at least, than those who did not.</p><p>“These trials published today show more global collaboration than we’ve ever seen in critical care,” says Christopher Seymour, a doctor and professor of critical care at the University of Pittsburgh who co-authored <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2770278\">one of the papers </a>published in the package.</p><p>A total of 1703 patients were studied in the seven randomized trials that were included in the WHO meta-analysis. 647 of those severely ill patients died during the trial period, which ranged from 21 to 30 days across all the trials. Importantly, the meta-analysis found that the patients that experienced severe cases of COVID-19 were about one third less likely to die if they received treatment with a corticosteroid.</p><p>Trial enrollees had a median age of 60 years. 29 percent of them were women. They were located in 12 countries, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Several common corticosteroids were used in the different trials, including dexamethasone, hydrocortisone, and methylprednisolone.</p><p>Corticosteroids are commonly used in medical practice, as they are inexpensive and potent anti-inflammatories, but they have a host of side effects. They’ve been studied before for use in patients with ARDS, a syndrome that can be caused by a host of things including trauma and disease, since the 1960s. But until now, there’s never been any definitive results showing these powerful anti-inflammatories definitely help patients with ARDS, says Benjamin Singer, an intensive care doctor at Northwestern University who was not involved with any of the studies.</p><p>“The idea of using steroids in critically ill patients with ARDS has a very long history,” he says. “Now we have accumulating evidence, particularly focused around the group of patients with COVID-19, that there appears to be a nice [sign] of benefit when they’re given corticosteroids.”</p><p>Previous trials of corticosteroids in ARDS patients had both positive and negative results, and doctors did not regard the drugs as a front-line treatment for the condition, says Singer. The fact that a clear signal emerged in all the trials that were part of the COVID-19 ARDS meta-analysis is probably related both to the fact that all the patients in these trials had the same illness (COVID-19), he says.</p><p>Additionally, “there is some indication that the biology underlying ARDS [associated with] COVID-19 may be a bit different than ARDS and we’ve known it before,” says Seymour.</p><p>There’s still a lot scientists don’t know about using corticosteroids with COVID-19 ARDS patients. Namely, there’s no data yet on the long-term impacts of using these drugs on patients with this severe form of COVID-19. This makes it hard to weigh the benefits versus the risks of using these drugs to treat ARDS. But these papers represent hopeful progress, both because they advance the science of COVID-19 treatment and because they provide evidence of unprecedented international scientific cooperation in fighting this disease.</p><p>When Singer last spoke to Popular Science in May, he raised <a href=\"https://www.popsci.com/story/health/experimental-drugs-treatments-covid-19-coronavirus/\">concerns</a> that intensive care doctors had about trying too many unproven treatments to address COVID-19 related ARDS, and the need for gold-standard controlled trials and evidence in treating the sickest COVID-19 patients.</p><p>“Now,” he says, “we have convincing data from well-done, rigorous randomized-control trials that, broadly speaking, corticosteroids are beneficial for patients with COVID-19 ARDS.”</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 03 Sep 2020 16:08:13 +0000","feedId":410,"bgimg":"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/HuVzhzXMmh6B2vTUOrkgFrlRs_c=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/N4F5VV2EBZBQTFQM3BCZEWXIFM.jpg","linkMd5":"7981b47ad2a56a87a653f173645e393b","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn45@2020_5/2020/09/04/16-44-38-912_624afdefb0bb1a4d.webp","destWidth":4752,"destHeight":3168,"sourceBytes":2154204,"destBytes":1589282,"author":"Kat Eschner","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/HuVzhzXMmh6B2vTUOrkgFrlRs_c=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/N4F5VV2EBZBQTFQM3BCZEWXIFM.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn45@2020_5/2020/09/04/16-44-38-912_624afdefb0bb1a4d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599237877750},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 00:44:37","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 00:44:37","title":"All the pros—and cons—of convalescent plasma therapy for COVID-19   ","link":"https://www.popsci.com/story/health/convalescent-plasma-covid-19-coronavirus/","description":"<img alt=\"Convalescent plasma treatment has been around for a century.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" height=\"4480\" src=\"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/LyImT6kRfQ9TDRSwsZqK9xmQ-CM=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/2EATN6VAZJCJJO235T5OOXK7GU.jpg\" width=\"6720\"/><br/><caption>Convalescent plasma treatment has been around for a century.

Unlike many bacterial invaders that are thwarted by antibiotics, there <a href=\"https://www.popsci.com/story/health/hydroxychloroquine-covid-19-treatment/\" target=\"_blank\">aren’t many pharmaceuticals that help</a> us beat viral infections. Last week, <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-issues-emergency-use-authorization-convalescent-plasma-potential-promising-covid-19-treatment#:~:text=Today,+the+U.S.+Food+and,efforts+to+fight+COVID-19.\" target=\"_blank\">the FDA issued an emergency use authorization </a>for a treatment called convalescent plasma. The therapy isn’t new—in fact, it was used in the 1918 flu pandemic. Here’s everything you need to know about the treatment, what it does, and how well it works.</p><p>What is convalescent plasma?</p><p>When your body comes into contact with an infectious microbe (like a bacteria or virus), your immune system generates antibodies to fend off the invader. Those antibodies remain in your bloodstream for some time (it varies by person and infection) even after you’ve recovered to help you fend off future infections with the same microbe. That’s exactly <a href=\"https://www.popsci.com/story/health/coronavirus-us-rising-rates/\">what people’s immune systems do</a> when they come into contact with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.</p><p>The antibodies rest in the blood’s plasma, which is the liquid material that holds blood cells. Scientists think that antibodies that helped one person fight off COVID-19 could help another person who’s also been infected with the novel coronavirus. So, in a person who successfully fought COVID-19, doctors remove some of their plasma, isolate the antibodies, and inject them into another person who is currently battling the disease.</p><p>The theory is that if you give someone with COVID-19 these antibodies—or convalescent plasma—early on in their illness, then those antibodies might start fending off the virus even before the recipient’s own immune system makes custom antibodies. That extra boost, so to speak, could help provide a better outcome for someone that might have had a severe bout of COVID-19.</p><p>Which diseases has it worked on?</p><p>The use of convalescent plasma has been around for around 100 years and has been used to both prevent and treat various infectious diseases throughout the past century. In fact, doctors and researchers <a href=\"https://www.jci.org/articles/view/138003\">have used the treatment</a> for outbreaks of polio as well as past pandemics, including the 1918 flu. It’s also been used as <a href=\"https://www.jci.org/articles/view/138745\">a treatment for</a> rabies, hepatitis B, measles, Ebola, MERS, and SARS. Because SARS and MERS are both coronaviruses, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4994343/\">a few</a> <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15616839/\">reports</a> showing small amounts of success with convalescent plasma led researchers to try using the therapy in COVID-19 patients.</p><p>How well does it work?</p><p>Since the start of the pandemic, there have been a number of case reports on the effectiveness of the treatment. Many of them weren’t controlled studies, however, and most times the patients got a number of other treatments—like steroids, antivirals, and other drugs—in addition to the convalescent plasma. So, it’s hard to tell how well the plasma treatment worked on its own from those case reports.</p><p>In August, the Mayo Clinic <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.12.20169359v1.full.pdf\">released the results of a study</a> they conducted on convalescent plasma that included more than 35,000 people. It found a small decrease in the death rate in folks who received the treatment, particularly those who received it early in their diagnosis. It also found that people who received transfusions of the plasma within three days of their initial COVID-19 diagnosis had an average death rate of 8.7 percent, whereas those who received the treatment after four days or more had a death rate of 11.9 percent.</p><p>Still, the study hasn’t been peer-reviewed, and it didn’t include a placebo group, meaning that there’s no group of COVID-19 positive people who received identical care other than the addition of the plasma treatment to compare to.</p><p>Further, each of the patients in the 35,000-person trial also received at least one more form of therapy—an antiviral, antibiotic, or corticosteroids, for example.</p><p>In the US, there are now a number of studies investigating how well convalescent plasma works on COVID-19 that do include a placebo and more rigorous testing, but most of them are still ongoing and results are not yet available.</p><p>Because of the weakly positive results of the Mayo Clinic trial and the other case reports, scientists around the country, including Anthony Fauci and the head of the National Institutes of Health and, initially <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/19/us/politics/blood-plasma-covid-19.html\">tried to get the FDA to hold off</a> on giving the plasma treatment emergency approval. Some researchers think the convalescent plasma case represents in some ways how all treatments for COVID-19 are being studied. “It raises the question of what strength of evidence is necessary to treat during a pandemic,” Harlan Krumholz, director of the Center for Outcomes Research and Evaluation at Yale New Haven Hospital, <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2020/08/23/is-convalescent-plasma-safe-and-effective/\">told <i>STAT</i></a><i>. </i></p><p>Is it risky?</p><p>Convalescent plasma appears to be safe. Severe adverse events in the first four hours after the transfusion <a href=\"https://www.jci.org/articles/view/140200/pdf\">was reported in less than one percent</a> of people who received the treatments. That included at least 72,000 people.</p><p>Are there similar, better treatments?</p><p>Some scientists and drug companies are working on designing and creating monoclonal antibodies, which are lab-made versions of the same antibodies our immune system naturally produces, that specifically target SARS-CoV-2. They would be infused into a person’s vein in a similar way to the current convalescent plasma. There are some ongoing clinical trials, but no definitive results yet.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 01 Sep 2020 22:01:10 +0000","feedId":410,"bgimg":"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/LyImT6kRfQ9TDRSwsZqK9xmQ-CM=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/2EATN6VAZJCJJO235T5OOXK7GU.jpg","linkMd5":"81c463a312d674823bcfc87f6f4baa50","destWidth":6720,"destHeight":4480,"sourceBytes":2448974,"destBytes":1599208,"author":"Claire Maldarelli","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/LyImT6kRfQ9TDRSwsZqK9xmQ-CM=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/2EATN6VAZJCJJO235T5OOXK7GU.jpg":null},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599237877739},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 00:44:37","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 00:44:37","title":"The best graphing calculators for students","link":"https://www.popsci.com/story/shop/graphing-calculators/","description":"<img alt=\"Tackle the tough problems head on.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" height=\"625\" src=\"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/Ro1KMcHk1qaFSe3w7hf8tREirjQ=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/OCOM2Y3EP5GPVN2E2CD56PRM44.jpg\" width=\"938\"/><br/><caption>Tackle the tough problems head on.

(MusicFox Fx via Unsplash/)</caption><p>There was a time when scootering was considered a children’s activity, but times are changing and scooters are becoming more and more popular amongst adults. A kick scooter is a great way to get where you need to go, breeze through traffic, and have fun while doing so. Kick scooters are often more portable than a standard bicycle or electric scooter and definitely less expensive than a car or frequent rideshares. They just might be the perfect way to get some exercise <i>and</i> get to your next meeting on time. There are a number of things to look for when finding the right ride: weight capacity, adjustability, and overall style for example. Here are a few of the best scooters available for quick, convenient travel.</p><img alt=\"Never outgrow fun.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" height=\"626\" src=\"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/iwSKTd3qI52iPDV7_wa9Xm8YSFE=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/LKN7PWFMRZHT5LCUP3YAHYL53I.jpg\" width=\"1000\"/><br/><caption>Never outgrow fun.

The planning documents include detailed guidance for how to roll out two unidentified vaccine candidates to healthcare workers and other groups at particularly high risk from COVID-19.</p><p>Since the beginning of the pandemic, vaccine developers have raced to<a href=\"https://www.popsci.com/story/health/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-development/\"> bring a COVID-19 vaccine to market at unprecedented speeds</a>. More than<a href=\"https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/draft-landscape-of-covid-19-candidate-vaccines\"> 150 vaccine candidates</a> are under development, with<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html\"> 37 already being tested in people</a>. This process includes three phases of clinical trials that determine whether a vaccine is safe and effective. To begin distributing a COVID-19 vaccine on such a short timeline could mean cutting short the final phase of these trials, which involves monitoring tens of thousands of volunteers who have received the vaccine candidate.</p><p>We<a href=\"https://www.popsci.com/story/health/herd-immunity-covid-19-vaccine/\"> cannot depend on herd immunity</a> to stop the spread of COVID-19; a vaccine will be necessary to end the pandemic, says Stacey Schultz-Cherry, an infectious disease researcher at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis.</p><p>“The CDC asking states and cities to be prepared to distribute a vaccine is not a bad idea, because you’d rather have them doing it now and being prepared than scrambling at the last minute,” she says. “It’s been very exciting to see how quickly the vaccines have developed—but we absolutely cannot release a vaccine unless we’re sure it’s safe.”</p><p>Some experts are concerned that distributing a vaccine as early as the end of October would be overly ambitious. “It’s hard not to see this as a push for a pre-election vaccine,” Saskia Popescu, an infection prevention epidemiologist in Arizona, told the Times.</p><p>Anthony Fauci, the nation’s leading infectious disease expert and director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,<a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/coronavirus-vaccine-fauci-trials-results/\"> has recently said</a> that phase 3 clinical trials for a COVID-19 vaccine could be stopped early if a<a href=\"https://aidsinfo.nih.gov/understanding-hiv-aids/glossary/192/data-and-safety-monitoring-board\"> Data and Safety Monitoring Board</a>—an independent committee of physicians and other experts—determines that there is enough evidence that the candidate is both safe and effective.</p><p>Still, there are consequences to terminating trials early, says Schultz-Cherry. “The worst thing that could happen would be to release a vaccine that’s not safe…imagine for all of our vaccine programs the impact that would have on public health and consumer confidence.”</p><p>One concern is that ending trials too soon would prevent researchers from recruiting a diverse enough pool of volunteers—particularly from groups that have been hit hardest by COVID-19, such as the elderly, people of color, and people with underlying conditions—and investigating the vaccine’s effects over a long period of time. “You want to make sure that this vaccine is safe and is going to be effective in all populations,” says Schultz-Cherry.</p><p>Extremely rare side effects can go unnoticed if the vaccine is not tested over a long enough time period in a large enough group of people. To justify ending these trials early, Schultz-Cherry says, “It has to be overwhelmingly positive data.”</p><p>The CDC did not specify which vaccine candidates the states should begin preparations for. However, the descriptions in the planning documents match up well with two vaccines currently undergoing phase 3 clinical trials that each include 30,000 volunteers, according to the Times report. One vaccine, developed by the Massachusetts-based biotech company Moderna, is being tested at about 89 sites across the United States. The other, from the New York-based pharmaceutical company Pfizer, is being investigated in volunteers in the United States, Argentina, Brazil, and Germany.</p><p>Both vaccines are made of genetic material from the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. The vaccine works by delivering messenger RNA (mRNA) that the recipient’s own cellular machinery uses as instructions to build copies of the spike-shaped protein on the surface of the virus. This spike protein, which doesn’t cause disease on its own, appears to be the part of the pathogen that the immune system<a href=\"https://www.popsci.com/story/health/covid-19-coronavirus-immunity-vaccine/\"> responds most strongly to</a>. “It’s basically giving your body the ability to make that [SARS-CoV-2] protein and then generate natural antibodies to it,” Schultz-Cherry says.</p><p>No<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/22/21266897/coronavirus-vaccine-development-strategies-pros-cons\"> gene-based vaccines</a> to prevent or treat any disease have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration as of now.

Plus they can be easily tweaked if the virus mutates.</p><p>“So far the vaccines look promising—they look like they’re safe, and they look like they’re generating good…immune responses,” Schultz-Cherry says.<a href=\"https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/07/20/more-pfizer-phase-i-results-antibodies-viral-mutations-and-t-cells\"> Preliminary data</a><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/26/moderna-says-its-coronavirus-vaccine-shows-promising-results-in-small-trial-of-elderly-patients.html\"> indicates that</a> the vaccines stimulate multiple parts of the immune system, including antibodies and T-cells.</p><p>One drawback, however, is that RNA vaccines must be stored at extremely cold temperatures to prevent the genetic material from breaking down—minus 70 and minus 20 degrees Celsius for the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, respectively.</p><p>“If these are the vaccines that are going to be deployed, one of the really important reasons why logistically the states need to be prepared is because you can’t just take it to a workplace or a doctor’s office…if they don’t have the proper storage conditions,” Schultz-Cherry says. “It would be like…if I say I’m going to buy you some ice cream and I’ll bring it to you, you have to be prepared to either eat it right then or store it somewhere because it’s not going to last.”</p><p>This means that states must prepare facilities with freezers that can store these vaccines and decide where people will need to go to receive them. Additionally, they must figure out who will receive the vaccine first, ensure that they have enough syringes and other supplies, and set up databases to track who is receiving the vaccine (both candidates are given in two doses several weeks apart).</p><p>“There’s a lot to do if the results continue to look very promising and it’s safe,” Schultz-Cherry says. “It’s not insurmountable by any means, but it needs to be coordinated.”</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 04 Sep 2020 15:52:17 +0000","feedId":410,"bgimg":"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/ODEQOpLz2ZhfcBuguVInV-3waK8=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/MYW4O43SJJG7ZHIUY3HXZ5AKPQ.jpg","linkMd5":"f350b09e482a500f3fd7223aa08ec452","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn25@2020_3/2020/09/04/16-44-49-941_a63ca23ed50f6931.webp","destWidth":6016,"destHeight":4016,"sourceBytes":2050243,"destBytes":1007570,"author":"Kate  Baggaley","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/ODEQOpLz2ZhfcBuguVInV-3waK8=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/MYW4O43SJJG7ZHIUY3HXZ5AKPQ.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn25@2020_3/2020/09/04/16-44-49-941_a63ca23ed50f6931.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599237877726},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 00:44:37","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 00:44:37","title":"These black holes collided so hard they made space-time jiggle","link":"https://www.popsci.com/story/science/massive-black-hole-merger-gravitational-waves/","description":"<img alt=\"Artist’s impression of binary black holes about to collide.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/sVGpS2HfyO0zx51YcFSP3AMBUhU=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/PEGCQT5W5BCJDE6SNHPVCLNB3U.jpg\" width=\"1440\"/><br/><caption>Artist’s impression of binary black holes about to collide. (Mark Myers, ARC Centre of Excellence for Gravitational Wave Discovery (OzGrav)/)</caption><p>Some 7 billion light-years away, two black holes swirled closer and closer together over eons until they crashed together with a furious bang, creating a new black hole in the process. This disturbance in the cosmos caused space-time to stretch, collapse, and even jiggle, producing ripples known as gravitational waves which reached our Earthly abode on May 21st of 2019.</p><p>Using LIGO (Laser Interferometry Gravitational-wave Observatory), a pair of identical, two-and-a-half-mile-long interferometers in the United States, and Virgo, a roughly two-mile-long detector in Italy, an international team of scientists announced Wednesday that they had detected this cosmic collision, and it’s racking up superlatives: it’s the biggest, the farthest, and the most energetic black hole merger observed to date. This is also the first definite sighting of an intermediate-sized black hole, clocking in at about 142 times more massive than the Sun, forged from a black hole merger. The findings were published on Wednesday in a paper detailing the discovery in <a href=\"https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.125.101102\">Physical Review Journals</a> and another detailing the implications of the event in the <a href=\"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/aba493\">Astrophysical Journal Letters</a>.</p><p>The merger signal, called GW190521, lasted only a tenth of a second—but scientists immediately realized it was extraordinary in comparison to the low chirp of two colliding black holes LIGO detected in 2015, which confirmed Einstein’s ineffable notions on space-time. “It’s the biggest bang since the Big Bang that humanity has ever observed,” says Alan Weinstein, an astronomer at the California Institute of Technology who was part of the study. It could offer clues as to why the Universe looks the way it does.</p><p>Computer algorithms analyzed the signal, ultimately allowing scientists to pinpoint the masses of the merger and just how much energy was released. The two progenitor black holes weighing in at about 66 and 85 solar masses merged into a black hole of 142 Suns. The remaining eight solar masses would have been converted into gravitational wave energy.</p><p>Up until now, scientists have been able to detect and indirectly observe black holes in two different size ranges: stellar-mass black holes, which measure from a few solar masses up to tens of solar masses, and supermassive black holes that range from hundreds of thousands to several billions of times the mass of our sun. However, astronomers that detected GW190521 witnessed the birth of a special breed of black hole: an “intermediate-mass” black hole. A few potential intermediate black holes have been spotted, but this is the first direct evidence of their existence.</p><p>This strange signal was produced by the merger of two equally weird black holes: The heavier of the two merging black holes, at 85 solar masses, is the first black hole so far detected smack-dab in what is known as the “pair-instability mass gap.” A star that collapses shouldn’t be able to produce a black hole between the range of 65 to 120 solar masses because the most massive stars are obliterated by the supernova that comes hand in hand with their collapse. According to Weinstein, a possible explanation might be what astronomers call hierarchical mergers—when lighter stellar-mass black holes merge into heavier ones, which then merge into heavier ones still,” consolidating until they become gargantuan black holes.</p><p>Astrophysicist K.E. Saavik Ford of the Graduate Center at City University New York who was not involved in the study says this finding is particularly exciting: “It’s a bridge between the black holes that are formed directly when stars collapse and supermassive black holes that we find in the centers of galaxies.” As Saavik Ford points out, it’s actually very hard to make hierarchical mergers since black hole remnants have to find each other, and then merge together. “That takes many, many, many lifetimes of the universe under anything like normal circumstances,” Saavik Ford says, “so it had to have happened in a very dense stellar environment” like an active galactic nucleus or AGN.</p><p>Earlier this summer, Saavik Ford and her team published a <a href=\"https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.124.251102\">paper</a> about a black hole merger exploding with light coming from the same general part of the sky as the one detailed this week. Though there could be a connection between the flare and the merging black holes outlined in the recent papers, Ford is waiting for the full dataset of the new findings to be shared to tease out some answers.</p><p>Right now, LIGO and Virgo are not making observations, but the two facilities will be back online by the end of next year with some upgrades. Gravitational-wave astronomers like Weinstein hope these Earth-bound gravitational wave detectors become all the more sensitive in order to probe more distant sources and look farther back in time in the evolution of the universe. “We need to look for more exotic events like this one—and for more exotic events like nothing we have ever seen before,” Weinstein says. “Wouldn’t that be great?”</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 03 Sep 2020 21:00:00 +0000","feedId":410,"bgimg":"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/sVGpS2HfyO0zx51YcFSP3AMBUhU=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/PEGCQT5W5BCJDE6SNHPVCLNB3U.jpg","linkMd5":"eec32b2fc7b956c4a92107e1709ae039","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn72@2020_5/2020/09/04/16-44-38-152_2d3759b1b0dbc15f.webp","destWidth":1440,"destHeight":1080,"sourceBytes":158548,"destBytes":115398,"author":"Paola Rosa-Aquino","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/sVGpS2HfyO0zx51YcFSP3AMBUhU=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/PEGCQT5W5BCJDE6SNHPVCLNB3U.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn72@2020_5/2020/09/04/16-44-38-152_2d3759b1b0dbc15f.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599237877745},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 00:44:37","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 00:44:37","title":"Your car is probably full of spiders ","link":"https://www.popsci.com/story/science/weirdest-thing-car-spiders-n95-mask-galveston-hurricane/","description":"<img alt=\"The world is just full of furry little friends like this guy.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" height=\"1182\" src=\"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/QqFI-f-pqsc1QhO74OPocYyCwts=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/ZQ5SU5QUNNHKLM2DCH755U7TDI.jpg\" width=\"1920\"/><br/><caption>The world is just full of furry little friends like this guy.

So when I first heard the story <a href=\"https://www.popsci.com/blog-network/eek-squad/why-do-spiders-apparently-cars-so-much/\" target=\"_blank\">about how Mazda6 sedans were apparently overrun with yellow sac spiders</a> to the point of requiring a recall of more than 100,000 vehicles, I kind of accepted it at face value. </p><p>Then I realized that I do actually know some things about spiders (a heck of lot more than I know about cars), and it seemed odd that an arachnid would be attracted to the smell of gasoline—the commonly cited reason behind Mazda’s fuel tank issue. Sure, some people love the scent, but why would a spider? As I explain in the episode, the olfactory explanation doesn’t actually pass the sniff test—which led me to wonder why a particular vehicle might experience widespread yellow sac infestations. </p><p>The major complicating factor here is that <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/dozens-insects-and-spiders-may-live-every-room-your-house-180957853/\" target=\"_blank\">spiders are everywhere</a>. Seriously. You don’t realize how many spiders are in and around your house right now. <a href=\"https://www.burkemuseum.org/collections-and-research/biology/arachnology-and-entomology/spider-myths/myth-youre-always-within-three-feet-spider\" target=\"_blank\">While the oft-repeated “fact” that you’re never more than three feet away from an arachnid is not <i>technically</i> true</a>, that’s only because the world is such a heterogeneous place—you might be a few hundred feet away from the nearest spider if you’re in a mall parking lot, but there may be multiple critters within a few inches of you if you’re standing in the grass! The main takeaway is that spiders can be really tiny, there are lots of them in the world, and there’s bound to be at least one kind of eight-legged creepy crawler that enjoys living in any given environment—your car included. But don’t freak out: <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/should-i-kill-spiders-in-my-home-an-entomologist-explains-why-not-to-95912\" target=\"_blank\">Spiders are generally helpful creatures</a>.   </p><p>You’ll have to listen to the episode to find out the strange journey I went on to track down the answer. For now, I’ll say that this was a big exercise in how a great story can become so pervasive that it seems true.</p><p>FACT: Racism and weather science once collided to kill thousands of people</p><p><i>By </i><a href=\"https://www.kendrawrites.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Kendra-Pierre Louis</i></a><i>, Reporter for the new podcast </i><a href=\"https://gimletmedia.com/shows/howtosaveaplanet\" target=\"_blank\"><i>How to Save a Planet</i></a></p><p>In September of 1900, a hurricane hit the bustling island city of Galveston, Texas and killed at least 10,000 people. As the deadliest natural disaster in US history, the storm gets plenty of attention—but most people present it as an unavoidable tragedy. No one knew it was coming, lots of people died, and these days we can do better. </p><p>But you don’t have to look too closely into the Galveston storm to realize those deaths were, in fact, <i>completely</i> avoidable. The city’s residents could have been told about the hurricane far enough in advance to evacuate, thanks to <a href=\"https://www.historynet.com/blown-away.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Cuban Jesuit priest and meteorologist Father Benito Viñes</a>. He and the other priests at his observatory were particularly adept at reading the clouds for storm intensity and trajectory, and he tried to warn Texans about the incoming threat. But the US Weather Bureau had an aggressive policy of squashing Cuban forecasts—which they saw as backwards, unscientific, and liable to incite unnecessary panic. </p><p>FACT: The N95 mask was inspired by a bra cup—and the woman who designed it is also behind the greatest snack food ever invented</p><p><i>By </i><a href=\"https://twitter.com/RachelFeltman\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Rachel Feltman</i></a></p><p>I’d like to talk about ribbons, bras, and N95 masks. </p><p>Born in Manhattan in 1917 to a pair of poor Jewish immigrants from Russia, <a href=\"https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/MOTHER-OF-INVENTION-High-energy-well-traveled-2808517.php\" target=\"_blank\">Sara Finkelstein </a>was a real 20th-century thinkfluencer right from the start. In her two decades as Decorating Editor for <i>House Beautiful</i>, she helped pioneer such concepts as the “family room” and living with a roommate to split expenses. </p><p>But her real impact started in the late 50s, when she set off on her own as a design consultant. Now going as “Sara Little”—she was 4′11″ and had frequently been called “Little Sara” in the early years of her career—she helped dozens of companies design and market products that <a href=\"https://designmuseumfoundation.org/ask-why/\" target=\"_blank\">people would actually find useful</a>. That was more radical at the time than you might think: Up until that point, most mass-market products were designed based on what retailers said they wanted, not based on what consumers said they needed. Her accomplishments are astonishing, and we probably don’t know about most of the products she worked on. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sara_Little_Turnbull\" target=\"_blank\">A few highlights</a>:</p><ol><li>She’s responsible for the first successful boxed chocolate cake sold in England, because she figured out that American cake products were flopping due to the differences between “cake” and “pudding.”</li><li>For Corning, she used materials developed for ballistic missiles to create freezer-to-oven-to-countertop dishes. She &#60;i&#62;also &#60;/i&#62;developed the ergonomic lid tops that are so ubiquitous today—allegedly by watching how tigers grasped their prey.</li><li>She reportedly convinced a cosmetics company to sell matte makeup products after getting very interested in Geisha culture in Japan.</li><li>She once went to various prisons to interview professional lock-picks to help her design a better lock.</li><li>She helped create both Bacos, aka bacon bits, and Bugles, aka the greatest snack of all time. </li></ol><p>But these days, Sara Little Turnbull (the professional name she adopted upon marrying in her late 40s) is best known for her influence over a now-ubiquitous product: The N95 mask. In this week’s episode, I dive into the <a href=\"https://cen.acs.org/articles/87/i4/Newscripts.html\" target=\"_blank\">myths</a>—and fantastic truths—of her journey from working with gift wrap ribbons to reinventing the face mask.

So, we’re dubbing this September </i><a href=\"https://www.popsci.com/muscle-month\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Muscle Month</i></a><i> to help you keep up your fitness, power, and health in socially distant times.</i></p><p>Working out at home is the best alternative to going to the gym, but if you don’t happen to have a dedicated space for it, chances are your living room will start to smell. That sweaty stench is definitely a downside of doing your push-ups on that bouncy carpet of yours, but it’s also easily avoidable and manageable.</p><p>Why do we stink?</p><p>At least when it’s fresh, <a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/preventing-body-odor#1\" target=\"_blank\">human sweat is odorless</a>. The distinct smell only starts when <a href=\"https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/173478#what-is-body-odor\" target=\"_blank\">bacteria living on our skin break down the proteins in it</a>. This is why you rarely smell when you’re blasting through a workout but no one wants to be around you an hour later.</p><p>When you exercise, sweat doesn’t only accumulate on your skin, but it also flies everywhere—think about the fine mist you release every time you swing a kettlebell. When you workout at home, that means sweat settles into your upholstery, the carpet, and that one spot you never dust behind the TV. There, bacteria get busy breaking it down and, thus, the pong.</p><p>Stop the smells before they start</p><img alt=\"Your yoga mat is literally a sponge. Your safest best is to let it air dry before rolling it.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/ZOB_t4DGsW79wjhSvDX8UzkRXn4=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/YD2GUZCCVRE25AVRBBWSWQKIMI.jpg\" width=\"2000\"/><br/><caption>Your yoga mat is literally a sponge. Your safest best is to let it air dry before rolling it. (Karolina Grabowska / Pexels/)</caption><p>Your grandmother may have covered this one when you were young, but in case you need a reminder, keep in mind that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. In this case, the saying definitely applies, since it’s a lot harder to get the smell of sweat out of everything, than it is to stop things getting smelly in the first place.</p><p>The best way to guarantee your living room won’t stink is to avoid working out there. If the weather’s good and you have access to a garden or a park nearby, take your workout outside—grass doesn’t need a thorough de-stink after your air squats.</p><p>If that’s not possible, avoid working out on a carpet or rug, since it will literally soak up your sweat. If you have wooden floors, they won’t get stinky, but they might get scuffed or damaged. There are other drawbacks to this as well—doing burpees and other similar movements on a hard surface can hurt you, not to mention that accumulated sweat on wooden or ceramic floors pose a serious slip hazard. The best option to take care of your joints and your floors is<a href=\"https://www.popsci.com/best-yoga-mats/\" target=\"_blank\"> a good yoga mat</a>. They’re soft, grippy, and designed to be easy to wipe down after a sweaty session. Just make sure it’s fully dry before you roll it up again after your workout <a href=\"https://abc13.com/health/whats-living-on-your-yoga-mat/520032/\" target=\"_blank\">to avoid smells and bacteria</a>.</p><p>Odor expert Marilee Nelson, co-founder of<a href=\"https://branchbasics.com/\" target=\"_blank\"> Branch Basics</a>, suggests buying<a href=\"https://amzn.to/3hV8tl1\" target=\"_blank\"> a cheap 20-inch x 20-inch box fan</a> and<a href=\"https://amzn.to/3jNFtfz\" target=\"_blank\"> a matching air filter</a>. Tape the filter to the back of the fan and run it while you workout. Not only will you get a refreshing breeze to keep you cool and stop you sweating so much, but you’ll be filtering the sweat particles evaporating from your skin, and the odor from the air.</p><p>Let nature take its course</p><p>What we smell are the volatile compounds sweat-loving bacteria release into the air—and it doesn’t take a high concentration to detect them, since the<a href=\"https://www.discovermagazine.com/mind/the-sense-of-smell-in-humans-is-more-powerful-than-we-think\" target=\"_blank\"> human nose is surprisingly sensitive</a>. But this also means there might not be that much odor to get rid of in the first place.</p><p>After a workout, Nelson recommends simply throwing open your windows and getting a breeze going through your living room. It might seem obvious, but it will clear out a lot of lingering odors.</p><p>Clean up after yourself</p><img alt=\"Yes, the smell is a huge drawback to working out at home, but having your doggo beside you is priceless.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/bZ60ve25vsuamR0hTeS7JfGb-8M=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/QIN5V55FPVGFNOCHTLEKVVHT7A.jpg\" width=\"2000\"/><br/><caption>Yes, the smell is a huge drawback to working out at home, but having your doggo beside you is priceless. (Cottonbro / Pexels/)</caption><p>As well as letting nature do its thing, you should probably put in a bit of clean up effort yourself.</p><p>Having a spray bottle with 70% rubbing alcohol is a great, easy, and cheap solution. This is enough to kill the bacteria that cause the bad smells but you really should be careful when spraying it, because it might be too abrasive on more delicate surfaces, like wood. Nelson suggested using vodka, which only goes up to 50% alcohol. This will in fact be gentler on your furniture, but it won’t be as effective against bacteria, so a few passes may be necessary.</p><p>To use it, Nelson recommends gently misting any carpets or couches you’ve sweated on and leaving the alcohol to evaporate. If you’ve been working out a while and not deodorizing, it might take a few passes to totally get rid of the stink. Just make sure the alcohol is totally gone—it’s odorless when it evaporates, so you’ll know when you no longer can smell it—and then repeat.</p><p>Nelson also notes that, as well as furniture and decor, odors cling to dust, fluff, and other detritus, so a good vacuuming every few days goes a long way.</p><p>For your equipment, a quick scrub with soapy water removes any dirt or grime, and a spray of your rubbing alcohol spray will bust the remaining bacteria. It’s the protocol both Nelson and<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/disinfecting-building-facility.html\" target=\"_blank\"> the CDC recommend</a>.</p><p>Shower and do your laundry</p><p>Just finished a tough workout? Get in the shower. Oh, was it just some light exercises? Get in the shower. Nice yoga flow? Yeah, get in the shower.</p><p>It takes time for bacteria to multiply and release that horrendous sweat smell. So if after a workout you kick your feet up on the couch, and throw on Netflix for an hour or two, you’re just giving them time to breed.</p><p>Instead, make the habit of throwing your workout gear into a closed hamper and hop straight in the shower after you’re finished exercising. You’ll feel better, be back on your couch bingeing Selling Sunset before you know it, and you won’t be stinking up your pad. Just a win-win-win of a situation.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 03 Sep 2020 13:00:00 +0000","feedId":410,"bgimg":"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/p5gV0-930e37CWTJ0yGIZR71haY=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/ETOUWJFOTVD63GHJXUJXGYPXE4.jpg","linkMd5":"4b0baf990575df44cd9cab38fdcab4b7","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn92@2020_5/2020/09/04/16-44-38-560_fd5cad45b736e184.webp","destWidth":2000,"destHeight":1500,"sourceBytes":204252,"destBytes":113762,"author":"Harry Guinness","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/p5gV0-930e37CWTJ0yGIZR71haY=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/ETOUWJFOTVD63GHJXUJXGYPXE4.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn92@2020_5/2020/09/04/16-44-38-560_fd5cad45b736e184.webp","https://www.popsci.com/resizer/ZOB_t4DGsW79wjhSvDX8UzkRXn4=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/YD2GUZCCVRE25AVRBBWSWQKIMI.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn1@2020_4/2020/09/04/16-45-04-062_2be92bbad33a593b.webp","https://www.popsci.com/resizer/bZ60ve25vsuamR0hTeS7JfGb-8M=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/QIN5V55FPVGFNOCHTLEKVVHT7A.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn20@2020_4/2020/09/04/16-45-03-561_f6bfa26a18575ae9.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599237877735},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 00:44:37","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 00:44:37","title":"How to get a six-pack (or even an eight-pack)","link":"https://www.popsci.com/story/health/how-to-get-abs/","description":"<img alt=\"Getting abs like this takes work—and genetics.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" height=\"4000\" src=\"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/rdLsi1w-6TJ9E6ZOL8RE6SW6ZWE=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/V5Q3TGDLNNCI3BQECJTT36NCK4.jpg\" width=\"6000\"/><br/><caption>Getting abs like this takes work—and genetics.

So, we’re dubbing this September </i><a href=\"https://www.popsci.com/muscle-month\"><i>Muscle Month</i></a><i> to help you keep up your fitness, power, and health in socially distant times.</i></p><p>You may have heard already that abs are made in the gym and revealed in the kitchen. You may have also clicked on this article hoping to hear that that’s not true.</p><p>Here in the inconvenient truth: you can have a full 8-pack, but you’ll never see it if it’s buried under fat.</p><p>That’s not to say that you need to lose body fat just because your abs aren’t on display. If you do an image search right now of “body fat abs,” you’ll get some non-scientific images showing roughly what men and women tend to look like at different body fat percentages. <a href=\"https://www.acefitness.org/education-and-resources/lifestyle/blog/112/what-are-the-guidelines-for-percentage-of-body-fat-loss/\">The norm</a> for men is around 18-24 percent, while women are around 25-31 percent. This is perfectly healthy, as are a variety of body fat percentages lower than that (and some above it as well). <a href=\"https://www.popsci.com/fat-but-fit/\">You can be healthy, unhealthy, fit, or out of shape at just about any size</a>.</p><p>Regardless, you’ll notice that images of folks with ‘normal’ amounts of body fat don’t tend to have visible abs, nor do many of the people below that mark. That’s because a stereotypical six-or-eight pack requires you to be exceptionally lean. You can get an extremely strong core without having a six pack, and there is truly no reason to strive for one unless you want to show one off. There’s nothing wrong with that! But if your primary goal is to be fit and have a strong core, washboard abs don’t have to be on your radar.</p><p>But hey, the heart wants what it wants, and maybe you’re really committed to seeing defined abs when you look in the mirror. There are <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92cjFZzTuVM\">two basic requirements</a> to getting a four, six, or eight pack. One is to actually have the muscles. Two is to have low body fat. The good news is that this is a simple equation. The bad news is that simple does not equal easy.</p><p>Let’s break it down a little more.</p><p>Make them</p><p>When we talk about abs, what we’re really talking about is the rectus abdominis, which is the panel of muscles covering the front of your torso below your chest. A piece of tissue, called the linea alba, separates that muscle down the center into the individual “packs.”</p><p>But despite being a large chunk of muscle, your abs have different sections that get engaged by different exercises. To get a full six pack, you’ll need to work the full rectus abdominis—so you won’t get there by doing 1,000 crunches a day. Make sure to pick a variety of movements to work all parts of the muscle (there’s a great guide <a href=\"https://athleanx.com/guide-to-six-pack-abs\">here</a>).</p><p>It’s worth noting that there are lots of movements that engage your core muscles that don’t necessarily translate into having separated, defined abs. Heavy squats and deadlifts require immense core strength, but crucially they don’t require moving your abs. You want your abs to move if you want them to get more defined, so go for leg raises or X man crunches or alternating jackknifes in addition to heavy lifting and planking.</p><p>Reveal them</p><p>The general consensus of unscientific collections of photos seems to be that to get defined abs, men need to get down to the 10 percent body fat range, while women might be more like 14 or 15, though it depends on how you personally carry fat and muscle. Your abs might poke through at higher levels of body fat, or they might not. How visible they are has nothing to do with how strong you are or how hard you’re working.</p><p>Don’t go about this cavalierly. Having very low body fat can come with its own issues—many women end up with hormonal problems, for instance—and it’s easier than you might think to <a href=\"https://www.popsci.com/diets-that-could-kill-you/\">get nutritional deficiencies by cutting out the wrong foods</a>. Don’t just pursue less and less body fat. Getting into the single digits for body fat percentages is something that even professional bodybuilders and fitness models only do for short periods of time, precisely because it’s unhealthy and unsustainable. It’s possible to have very little body fat and be healthy, but it takes careful consideration of your diet and eating habits—check with a nutritionist or physician if you’re pursuing something like this. For almost everyone, getting down to low levels of body fat will require losing some weight, and that won’t necessarily be a good thing. Every individual is different, and can end up with varying problems in their pursuit of fat loss.</p><p>Once you commit to losing weight, you may be overwhelmed by all the potential tips and tricks out there for slimming down. There are a lot of theories on weight loss, and you can find proponents of almost every strategy, from zero carbs to zero fat and everything in between. The truth, as ever, is more complicated. Here’s what all the scientific evidence actually agrees on:</p><ol><li>Lowering your calorie intake will pretty much always lead to some kind of weight loss</li><li>&#60;a href=\"https://www.popsci.com/best-diets-according-to-experts/\"&#62;The best diet is the one you can stick to&#60;/a&#62;</li></ol><p>That means adjusting your diet to lose weight will require eating less, but doing so in a way that’s sustainable. If you love sweets, you will never maintain a diet that cuts out all sweets. So don’t! <a href=\"https://www.popsci.com/nutritionists-guide-to-eating-junk-food/\">Eat the stuff you enjoy in moderation</a>, focus on whole foods over processed ones, and make small adjustments that you’re able to stick to. Even small daily cuts will add up over time. If you’re at a loss for how to lose weight, one of the simplest methods is to count calories. When you start it will feel exhausting, but the good news is that <a href=\"https://www.popsci.com/counting-calories-effective/\">research suggests even people who end up only roughly tracking their calories lose weight</a>. Knowing how many calories are in your food seems to make you more aware of what you consume, and if you’re trying to lose weight that awareness is likely to translate into eating less.</p><p>It’s also important to remember that eating less is not always better, especially when you also want to have lots of muscle, which requires more calories to maintain than fat. There is not a linear relationship between health and lower calorie counts. Food is fuel—treat it like that. Not eating enough will just cause you to lose muscle mass anyway, so without sufficient calories you’ll reverse your gains. Get plenty of protein and carbs.</p><p>Once you figure out a solid diet, the advice is simple: just stick to it. Weight loss is not an overnight thing. It will take time, but if you stay the course it will happen. And if you’re still working those abs and consuming plenty of fuel, you may just start to see some abs come out to say hello.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 04 Sep 2020 12:00:00 +0000","feedId":410,"bgimg":"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/rdLsi1w-6TJ9E6ZOL8RE6SW6ZWE=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/V5Q3TGDLNNCI3BQECJTT36NCK4.jpg","linkMd5":"f717010336b60f3e9820302e0fcbe36b","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn10@2020_6/2020/09/04/16-44-49-643_cf72f1ddd5cd4b84.webp","destWidth":6000,"destHeight":4000,"sourceBytes":1541028,"destBytes":449958,"author":"Sara Chodosh","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/rdLsi1w-6TJ9E6ZOL8RE6SW6ZWE=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/V5Q3TGDLNNCI3BQECJTT36NCK4.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn10@2020_6/2020/09/04/16-44-49-643_cf72f1ddd5cd4b84.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599237877746},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 00:44:37","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 00:44:37","title":"Small upgrades could make for big improvements in Samsung’s latest folding smartphone","link":"https://www.popsci.com/story/technology/samsung-galaxy-z-fold2-folding-smartphone/","description":"<img alt=\"The new Galaxy Z Fold2 has a similar shape as its older sibling, but it has gotten some notable upgrades.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/VVyUxNIbdp8BhA0K6ctgmlQlWW8=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/LXYRVDYKSNGAPG6EOCOPH4RVIE.jpg\" width=\"2000\"/><br/><caption>The new Galaxy Z Fold2 has a similar shape as its older sibling, but it has gotten some notable upgrades. (Samsung/)</caption><p>When Samsung announced the first Galaxy Z Fold smartphone back in 2019, it was the perfect embodiment of an early adopter device. At $1,980, it was twice as expensive as flagship smartphones, and its unique form factor made it immediately identifiable. It was undoubtedly flashy, but from a usability standpoint, it felt like a Frankenstein’s monster of gadgets. The parts were there—you had a smartphone and a tablet in one device—but the experience didn’t feel totally seamless.</p><p>Yesterday, Samsung announced the Galaxy Z Fold2, and in addition to some serious hardware upgrades, the device adds some practical features to make its form factor more useful.</p><p>The outside of the device now sports a 6.2-inch screen that takes up the entire front surface, compared to the smaller 4.6-inch screen that felt too miniscule on the original model. That makes it much more satisfying to use without having to flap it open. Opening the device still reveals a 7.6-inch screen, but now Samsung has added a protective layer of glass to the outside of the display, which should make it more durable. Even with the new glass, however, you can still expect to see a fold crease on the screen.</p><p>Underneath that crease, Samsung has redesigned the hinge, which now has increased elastic material in it, allowing it to rest in between 75 and 115 degrees of tilt. You can sit the phone open and facing you like a laptop to enable a makeshift two-display setup. So, you could have a video conference happening in the top display while the controls rest in the bottom. You can also turn the phone around and simply watch content on the outer screen without having to prop the phone up to find a comfortable angle. Those in-between orientations make using the device a lot more practical.</p><p>The camera upgrades make a lot of sense, too. The main camera array includes three individual modules, including a typical wide-angle, a super-wide angle, and a telephoto lens. Now, you can take a selfie using the main cameras on the outside of the clamshell while using the external screen as a viewfinder. You can also show the feed from the cameras on both inside and outside displays simultaneously.</p><p>There are now five total cameras on the Galaxy Z Fold2. There’s a selfie cam on front of the closed device, and another inside to go with the larger screen.</p><p>When it comes to apps, Samsung has streamlined some of the multitasking functions that seem natural for this kind of device. You can now save groups of apps to open at the same time in specific multi-window orientations. So, if you typically launch YouTube, Chrome, and Gmail at the same time, you can create a shortcut to throw them all up on the screen simultaneously. Samsung worked directly with Google in order to maximize compatibility with its apps.</p><p>Microsoft also got in on the development for Z Fold2, which means Office apps work better together now. For instance, you can keep Excel and PowerPoint open next to each other and drag-and-drop elements between the two.</p><p>These aren’t the flashiest aspects of the device, but as Samsung shifts its focus from early adopters to productivity-oriented users, they’re going to be important. The company is now competing against Microsoft and its Surface Duo device, which is firmly grounded in the function-over-fashion mindset.</p><p>Only real-world experience with the Z Fold2 will tell if these durability and usability improvements can justify the $2,000 price tag, but—at least on paper—this version seems more ready for the real world than its older sibling.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Sep 2020 19:55:01 +0000","feedId":410,"bgimg":"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/VVyUxNIbdp8BhA0K6ctgmlQlWW8=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/LXYRVDYKSNGAPG6EOCOPH4RVIE.jpg","linkMd5":"aff6a6f6bf72195473d8a6ac6a1011db","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn57@2020_5/2020/09/04/16-44-38-244_4b9f678c95c45675.webp","destWidth":2000,"destHeight":1500,"sourceBytes":123580,"destBytes":53874,"author":"Stan Horaczek","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/VVyUxNIbdp8BhA0K6ctgmlQlWW8=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/LXYRVDYKSNGAPG6EOCOPH4RVIE.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn57@2020_5/2020/09/04/16-44-38-244_4b9f678c95c45675.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599237877736},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 00:44:37","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 00:44:37","title":"Soft, lightweight Turkish towels for bathrooms and beach trips","link":"https://www.popsci.com/story/shop/turkish-towels/","description":"<img alt=\"Turkish towels offer a softness and portability.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/kyk6_584cenDV1aJHJigCLv98N8=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/TJYRHEZ7INDYZBZEL5YRK4A5Z4.jpg\" width=\"1500\"/><br/><caption>Turkish towels offer a softness and portability.

(Facebook AI &#38; NYU Langone Health/)</caption><p>When a patient climbs into an MRI scanner, it peers inside their body to reveal the complex anatomy within, like the ligaments and tendons in a knee. But in January, before <a href=\"https://www.popsci.com/coronavirus/\">COVID</a> struck, some patients who needed their knee scanned at NYU Langone Health started getting intentionally scanned twice. A scan for a typical human knee takes around 10 minutes, and these subjects—who had consented to taking part in a study—had their joint scanned at the normal speed, as well as about twice as fast (with the help of AI). After the coronavirus interruption, the work has since resumed using one scanner at the hospital.</p><p>That initiative is part of an ongoing effort at the medical center, in partnership with Facebook Artificial Intelligence Research, to see if running an MRI machine faster—and grabbing less data in the process—can produce images that are just as good those that arise the normal way. Reducing an approximately 10-minute knee scan to about 5 minutes, or shortening the scan time for other body areas, has obvious benefits: A patient could spend less time in a clanging tube (a procedure that demands they hold as still as possible) and hospitals could do more with the expensive, limited hardware they have.</p><p>To make this possible, radiologists and computer scientists need to employ artificial intelligence. If they were to run an MRI machine twice as fast as usual and then try to spin the data they collected into an image with the normal method, the result would be unusably bad. Enter AI: Using machine learning to analyze that comparably scant data and then create a picture produces something that is indeed usable, and in fact, looks to be of nicer quality to some radiologists’ eyes than the alternative.</p><img alt=\"This is what the complete raw data from an MRI machine looks before it's transformed into a usable image. The traditional way of doing so is called an inverse Fourier transform.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" height=\"1280\" src=\"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/1xXxnG0KIdNGDXdoszlx2MTbRgU=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/QV7LXJO4FBDBFLYFHOOLMIQ3UE.jpg\" width=\"1920\"/><br/><caption>This is what the complete raw data from an MRI machine looks before it's transformed into a usable image.

(Facebook AI &#38; NYU Langone Health/)</caption><p>The project <a href=\"https://ai.facebook.com/blog/fastmri-breakthrough-shows-ai-accelerated-mris-interchangeable-with-slow-traditional-mris/\">reported</a> good news last month. The researchers involved published the results of another study that aimed to determine if radiologists could tell the difference between typical MRI images and those that used AI, and if those scans were interchangeable diagnostically. Last year, <i>Popular Science</i> took a <a href=\"https://www.popsci.com/artificial-intelligence-fast-mri-scans-facebook-nyu/\">deep, exclusive dive into that process</a>, shadowing a physician who took part in the experiment. The study’s results <a href=\"https://www.ajronline.org/doi/abs/10.2214/AJR.20.23313\">were published</a> in the <i>American Journal of Roentgenology</i> last month.</p><p>What the study showed was encouraging. Dr. Michael Recht, the first author on the published study and the chair of the radiology department at NYU Langone Health, says that the images created by artificial intelligence (from a slimmer amount of data than is usually gathered) held up well compared to images made via the normal process. “There is no difference in how people read the scans, whether they’re reading the accelerated or the clinical [traditional] sequences,” Recht says. “They’re able to make the diagnosis equally well on either of the scans.”</p><p>In fact, he says he would rely on an AI-generated image of a patient’s knee to arrive at a diagnosis—a conclusion that a surgeon may then use when deciding whether or not to <a href=\"https://www.popsci.com/hip-replacements-young-patients/\">operate</a>. “The sequences really are interchangeable, and I’m very, very comfortable using those sequences to make a diagnosis,” he says. Of the six radiologists in the study, only one of them was able to discern whether the scans were made the normal way or with AI.</p><p>With this recently published study, patients were not actually scanned twice.

(Microsoft/)</caption><p>Deepfakes can be fun. Those videos that perfectly inserted <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HG_NZpkttXE\" target=\"_blank\">Jim Carrey into Jack Nicholson’s role in <i>The Shining</i></a> were endlessly entertaining. As the upcoming U.S. election closes in, however, analysts expect that deepfakes could play a role in the barrage of misinformation making its way out to potential voters.</p><p>This week, Microsoft announced new software called <a href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/09/01/disinformation-deepfakes-newsguard-video-authenticator/\" target=\"_blank\">Video Authenticator</a>. It’s designed to automatically analyze videos to determine whether or not algorithms have tampered with the footage.</p><p>The software analyzes videos in real-time and breaks it down frame-by-frame. In a way, it works similarly to familiar photographic forensic techniques. It looks for inconsistencies in edges, which can manifest as subtle changes in color or small pixel clusters (called artifacts) that lack color information. You would be hard-pressed to notice them with your own eyes, especially when dozens of frames are zipping by every second.</p><p>As the software performs its analysis, it spits out either a percentage or a confidence score to indicate how sure it is about an image’s legitimacy. Faking an individual frame is relatively simple at this point using modern AI techniques, but movement introduces an extra level of challenge, and that’s often where the software can glean its clues.</p><p>Research <a href=\"https://www.arxiv-vanity.com/papers/1901.08971/\">has shown</a> that errors typically happen when subjects appear in profile, quickly turn more than 45 degrees, or if another object rapidly travels in front of the person’s face. While these happen relatively commonly in the real world, they rarely happen during candidate speeches or video calls, which are prime targets during an election season.</p><p>To train the Video Authenticator, Microsoft relied on the <a href=\"https://www.arxiv-vanity.com/papers/1901.08971/\">FaceForensics++</a> dataset—a collection of manipulated media specifically to help train people and machines to recognize deepfakes. It contains 1.5 million images from 1,000 videos. Once built, Microsoft tested the software on the <a href=\"https://www.arxiv-vanity.com/papers/2006.07397/\">DeepFake Detection Challenge Dataset</a>, which Facebook AI created as part of a contest to build automated detection tools. Facebook paid 3,426 actors to appear in more than 100,000 total video clips manipulated with a variety of techniques, including everything from deep learning methods to simple digital face swaps.</p><p>Facebook’s challenge ended earlier this year and the winning entrant correctly identified the deepfakes 82 percent of the time. The company says it’s already using <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/deepfakes-not-very-good-nor-tools-detect/\">internal tools</a> to sniff out deepfakes, but it hasn’t publicly given any numbers about how many have shown up on the platform.</p><p>For now, average users won’t have access to Microsoft’s Video Authenticator. It will be available exclusively to the AI Foundation as part of its Reality Defender 2020 program, which allows candidates, press, campaigns, parties, and social media platforms to provide suspected fake media for authentication. But, down the road, these tools could become more available to the public.</p><p>Another big tech company—Google—has been hard at work on ways to detect face swaps; last year it hired actors and built its own dataset using paid actors similar to Facebook’s methods. While Google doesn’t have public plans for a specific deepfake detection site for everyday users, it has already implemented some image manipulation tools as part of its Image Search function, which is often the first step in trying to figure out if a photo is fake.</p><p>Microsoft didn’t share specific numbers about the success rate its AI-driven tool achieved, but the benchmark isn’t all that high when you survey the top performing players. The winner of Facebook’s challenge achieved its 82-percent success rate on familiar data—once it was applied to new clips taken in the real world with fewer controlled variables, its accuracy dropped to around 60 percent. Canadian company Dessa had <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/24/technology/tech-companies-deepfakes.html\">similar success</a> with the Google-produced videos with controlled variables. With videos pulled from other places on the web, however, it struggled to hit the 60 percent success mark.</p><p>We still don’t know how big a role deepfakes will play in the 2020 election, and with social media platforms doing their own behind-the-scenes detection, we may never know how bad it could have been. Maybe by the next election, computers will be better at recognizing the handiwork of other automated manipulators.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 03 Sep 2020 19:41:32 +0000","feedId":410,"bgimg":"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/8nE8pfjS6mYC2lH0kHCUIwJumL8=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/QJG37R2UIVEYXFF7IJ7Z7UZ7FA.png","linkMd5":"59e0a3f343f8d8331d2c8ed7cbb55d91","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn62@2020_5/2020/09/04/16-44-37-991_cddd17efd7d24cf7.webp","destWidth":774,"destHeight":437,"sourceBytes":73184,"destBytes":44242,"author":"Stan Horaczek","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/8nE8pfjS6mYC2lH0kHCUIwJumL8=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/QJG37R2UIVEYXFF7IJ7Z7UZ7FA.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn62@2020_5/2020/09/04/16-44-37-991_cddd17efd7d24cf7.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599237877741},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 00:44:37","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 00:44:37","title":"Hydration bladders for outdoor adventures","link":"https://www.popsci.com/story/shop/hydration-bladders/","description":"<img alt=\"Stay hydrated.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" height=\"625\" src=\"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/0CLHobg7Ufn5WJrpy0myjkPdmVk=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/CRC3HWY4XZA5TJLQVURMWMWHDI.jpg\" width=\"938\"/><br/><caption>Stay hydrated.

(Amazon /)</caption><p>For years, Amazon has <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Prime-Air/b?ie=UTF8&#38;node=8037720011\">envisioned</a> deploying drones to deliver packages to customers’ yards. In the company’s plan, an electric aerial vehicle would take off from a distribution center, cruise some 15 miles or less, and deposit whatever small item an American consumer wants faster than they can say, “Alexa, send me Air Jordans, but do it via the air.” (Technically, Amazon aims for the drone deliveries to take half an hour or less.)</p><p>In late August, the Federal Aviation Administration gave the company a green light to keep pushing the program forward in the national airspace; read more about the details in <a href=\"https://beta.regulations.gov/document/FAA-2019-0622-0003\">this FAA decision document</a>.</p><p>Amazon calls the service Prime Air, and it relies on a drone known as the MK27, which Amazon <a href=\"https://blog.aboutamazon.com/transportation/a-drone-program-taking-flight\">showed off</a> last year. Like many other drones, it employs multiple propellers that allow it to take off and land vertically, but this one pulls off an additional trick. While in cruise flight, it pivots so that the propeller shrouds become wing-like, giving the craft an aerodynamic boost as it flies more like a fixed-wing aircraft than a <a href=\"https://www.popsci.com/flying-experimental-sikorsky-helicopter/\">helicopter</a>. That’s similar to a configuration that a much bigger <a href=\"https://www.popsci.com/bell-drone-apt70-biplane-autonomous-flight/\">cargo drone</a> from helicopter-maker <a href=\"https://www.popsci.com/story/technology/bell-new-helicopter-electric-tail-rotor/\">Bell</a> uses, which can carry a whopping 70 pounds. But the Amazon concept is rated for cargo that’s lighter than 5 pounds, so it would be bringing items that are more likely to be running shoes than dumbbells.</p><p>That may not sound like much weight, but that sub-5-pound weight class actually “represents between 75 and 90 percent of the packages that Amazon delivers today,” Jeff Wilke, an Amazon executive, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDj5mLtyx4o&#38;feature=youtu.be\">said</a> last summer.</p><p>The intersection of delivery drones, airspace regulation, and a behemoth of a company like Amazon (which is less accustomed to building flying machines than, say, <a href=\"https://www.popsci.com/story/technology/boeing-777x-first-flight-folding-wingtips/\">Boeing</a>) is both complex and controversial. But Ryan Wallace, an assistant professor at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University and expert in drone public policy, welcomes the development. “Many UAS [unmanned aircraft systems] operators, particularly in the commercial space, have been frustrated with the pace, or the momentum, of regulatory change,” he says. “I think this is a very positive indication that the FAA is starting to be responsive to the industry’s push forward.”</p><p>He adds that Amazon’s work will help others in the sector. “Honestly, they are blazing trails for the rest of us,” he reflects. “In addition to the FAA’s eye being on Amazon’s success, you have the rest of the industry cheering them on from the sidelines.”</p><p>Amazon does not have carte blanche to do whatever it wants with the drone deliveries. The FAA’s exemption decision applies to just one specific drone model, and among other restrictions, states that the company cannot fly at night unless they add lights, can’t fly higher than 400 feet, and can operate “only in sparsely populated areas.” In other words, drone deliveries are likely not coming to <a href=\"https://www.popsci.com/amazons-patented-drone-towers-dont-make-any-sense/\">densely-packed suburbs</a> anytime soon. They also need to have one pilot in charge of one drone—a one-to-one ratio.</p><p>The FAA’s decision document also outlined comments made by more traditional <a href=\"https://www.popsci.com/tags/aviation/\">aviation</a>-focused organizations or companies, like the Air Line Pilots Association. That group, according to the FAA, “expressed concerns with Amazon’s proposal to conduct its own internal investigations of accidents and incidents and that the petition for exemption implies the investigations would occur without government coordination.”</p><p>In other words, delivery by drone is moving forward, but there is still plenty for companies and regulators to get straight. But for now, the news is a victory for Amazon—or anyone who is excited about a potential future where their orders arrive from the sky.</p><p>“This certification is an important step forward for Prime Air and indicates the FAA’s confidence in Amazon’s operating and safety procedures for an autonomous drone delivery service that will one day deliver packages to our customers around the world,” David Carbon, the vice president for Prime Air at Amazon, said in a statement. “We will continue to develop and refine our technology to fully integrate delivery drones into the airspace, and work closely with the FAA and other regulators around the world to realize our vision of 30 minute delivery.”</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Sep 2020 14:44:50 +0000","feedId":410,"bgimg":"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/SQpPeWZbzhNU5OIE3OGPQLqLPFA=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/JVW7XTSFZBG4XFYQC3DBE552YM.jpg","linkMd5":"60e32cbc2b1cb064c7aec8fc059b1d63","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn4@2020_2/2020/09/04/16-44-38-167_9ca390e2732a282c.webp","destWidth":2000,"destHeight":1333,"sourceBytes":139010,"destBytes":89954,"author":"Rob Verger","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/SQpPeWZbzhNU5OIE3OGPQLqLPFA=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/JVW7XTSFZBG4XFYQC3DBE552YM.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn4@2020_2/2020/09/04/16-44-38-167_9ca390e2732a282c.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599237877745},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 00:44:37","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 00:44:37","title":"Pizza cutters that will get you the slice of your dreams","link":"https://www.popsci.com/story/shop/pizza-cutters/","description":"<img alt=\"Seamless cutting for even slices.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" height=\"625\" src=\"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/3iO2U43sOG0-okG97_G-sBdbmjQ=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/AY4NEVCXL5HBPDWHNW4VXJAPG4.jpg\" width=\"938\"/><br/><caption>Seamless cutting for even slices.

(Carlo Giambarresi/)</caption><p><i>This story originally featured on </i><a href=\"https://www.flyingmag.com/story/pilot-proficiency/technicalities-how-airplanes-glide/\" target=\"_blank\">Flying Magazine</a>.</p><p>I was quite young when I first fell in love with gliding. It may have been even before I fell in love with Cecilia Revilla, who sat in front of me in the fourth grade. When I say gliding, I don’t mean flying a sailplane; I was much too young for that. I mean just the fact of something gliding—a butterfly, a model airplane, a folded-up sheet of paper. That a balsa-and-tissue model my father had made would sail out, bobbing on the ripples of the air, circling, swooping or even merely tracing a long, straight, gently descending line from the brow of a hill as if it were rolling on invisible wheels down an invisible road – that was sweet, magical and, as it turned out, life-shaping.</p><p>It was a lucky thing for the pioneers of flight that birds existed. Without them, it would not have been apparent that something rigid could fly. Birds flapped their wings to take off and land, so flapping must have seemed somehow essential to their mysterious powers of levitation; yet they could obviously stay up, and even ascend, while holding their wings perfectly motionless. How did they do it?</p><p>Five centuries ago, Leonardo da Vinci sketched a hang glider. It was an odd-looking thing, essentially an oval kite, quite a bit longer than it was wide, and lacking—as birds did—a fin or rudder to keep it pointed in the right direction. Strangely, for such an acute observer of nature, Leonardo apparently did not perceive the importance of wingspan for reducing the effort needed to fly. But his glider was still a plausible improvement upon the proverbial barn door.</p><p>Da Vinci recognized that it is not necessary to flap in order to fly: A flat surface with a weight suspended from it in the right place would slide forward along the air rather than drop vertically. This was a foundational insight, but another 400 years would pass before Otto Lilienthal built the first practical hang gliders. These were strikingly similar to da Vinci’s batlike ornithopters, which tried harder than his hang glider did to mimic the shape and anatomy of natural wings. Lilienthal successfully flew his gliders 2,000 times before an untimely gust upset one and killed him.</p><p>Today, gliding is so commonplace, we do not ask ourselves what’s happening when an airplane glides or, for that matter, when a helicopter does.</p><p>Go back to the basic ground-school diagram of the four forces—lift, weight, thrust and drag—that must be in equilibrium. Lift is an arrow pointing upward, and drag is one pointing backward. Gravity—no surprise—points downward. But the glider has no thrust. So why does it go forward?</p><p>One way to look at it is to remember that “lift” and “drag” are defined with respect to the airstream. Drag is parallel to the direction of flight; lift is at a right angle to it. So, when the glider is going downhill, its lift arrow is tilted a little bit forward and counteracts its drag.</p><p>That, at least, is the official explanation. A skeptical person will object that the definition of lift as a force acting at a right angle to the airstream is arbitrary. It’s just a verbal convenience. Why shouldn’t lift be defined as a vertical force, like gravity, or one acting at a right angle to the chord line? For that matter, why should we think of it as a single arrow at all? Physical reality holds no lift arrows. There is only pressure and friction on the surface of the wing—also on the rest of the aircraft, but for the purposes of thinking about gliding, it’s enough to consider only the wing. These forces can be represented as one arrow or two arrows, or a whole slew of arrows bristling from the airplane, porcupine fashion.</p><p>If we forget the arrows and consider only the pressures, we discover that high-velocity air flowing around the leading edge of the wing creates low pressure there, pulling it forward. At any sufficiently downward-inclined flight-path angle, there is some angle of attack at which the forward pressures acting on the wing and the backward ones on the rest of the airframe are in equilibrium, and the airplane does not speed up or slow down. Furthermore, its rate of descent at any speed is such that the potential energy it gives up by losing height is precisely equal to the energy needed to overcome its drag.</p><p>Wait, isn’t this perpetual motion—and illegal? No. The wing has to be descending for this to happen, and it cannot descend indefinitely. Eventually, it will reach the ground.</p><p>The case of a gliding helicopter is somewhat more perplexing. Think of a fan. When a fan is driven by a motor, air enters the back and accelerates out the front. But if you blow air at the fan from the front, it spins in the opposite direction. The rotor of a helicopter is analogous to a fan, but obviously, it does not stop and begin turning in the opposite direction if the engine quits and the helicopter starts to descend. It continues turning in the same direction, and at the same speed, as before.</p><p>The rotor blades glide just as an airplane does. It would be more precise, however, to say that only part of each blade glides because only part of each blade has the right combination of speed and angle of attack to achieve the proper balance between thrust and drag. The outermost portion of a rotor blade is moving too fast, and its angle of attack—the resultant of its circumferential velocity and the helicopter’s rate of descent—is too small; the sum of its forces is drag. The innermost portion is moving too slow; its angle of attack is too large, and it is stalled. Again, it exerts drag.</p><p>The middle portion of the blade is the sweet spot, generating enough excess thrust to keep the rotor spinning against the drags of the tip and the root. Unlike an airplane, a helicopter can even glide vertically because the blades do not see a vertical descent as truly vertical. For example, consider a hypothetical helicopter with a 30-foot rotor turning at 400 rpm. The circumferential speed of a blade at the midspan point is 315 feet per second. If the helicopter is descending vertically at 1,800 fpm, the angle of attack at midspan is about 6 degrees, which is a typical angle of attack for a gliding airplane. Adding, say, 50 knots of forward speed requires cyclic adjustment—that is, the pitch angle of the advancing blade, relative to the rotor disk, needs to be reduced and that of the retreating blade increased—but the average angle of attack remains around the same 6 degrees.</p><p>Gliding is the visible manifestation of invisible forces, the solution of a puzzle in which speed, rate of descent and angle of attack are the clues. The riddle would be maddening, but nature is kind: She gives us birds. And even a folded paper airplane, tossed from a third-floor window, instantly solves the equations of flight and knows, without instruction, how to glide.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 03 Sep 2020 12:33:28 +0000","feedId":410,"bgimg":"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/_6vhcRCfooJlDH1Wd6stvhWrZho=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/PUVBFRQYZZDIVLQTH6WE3UYJFM.jpg","linkMd5":"24ca83b33dc18d8ede78fcd7ee90fcc1","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn88@2020_6/2020/09/04/16-44-38-129_3070d7a5a23f831d.webp","destWidth":2000,"destHeight":1333,"sourceBytes":153284,"destBytes":69984,"author":"By Peter Garrison/Flying Mag","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/_6vhcRCfooJlDH1Wd6stvhWrZho=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/PUVBFRQYZZDIVLQTH6WE3UYJFM.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn88@2020_6/2020/09/04/16-44-38-129_3070d7a5a23f831d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599237877735},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 00:44:37","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 00:44:37","title":"The best boating tubes","link":"https://www.popsci.com/story/shop/boating-tubes/","description":"<img alt=\"The most fun you can have on a lake.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" height=\"625\" src=\"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/gyIVAr1jI6XFEJP99LjPZReCxA8=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/CI2TIC2NHBACPK5CA3B2D7RL6M.jpg\" width=\"938\"/><br/><caption>The most fun you can have on a lake.
