You can <a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python\">download the Python extension</a> from the Marketplace, or install it directly from the extension gallery in Visual Studio Code. If you already have the Python extension installed, you can also get the latest update by restarting Visual Studio Code. You can learn more about  <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial\">Python support in Visual Studio Code</a> in the documentation.</p>\n<p>This was a short release as we are now adjusting our release cadence to match that of VS Code (speaking of which, make sure to check the <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_59\">VS Code release notes</a> to see what’s new for all languages!). We’re excited to announce that the revamped Jupyter notebooks experience brought by the <a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter\">Jupyter extension</a> is now out of preview, and that we have an improved way of sorting Python interpreters on the selection list.</p>\n<p>If you’re interested, you can check the list of improvements in our <a href=\"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-python/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md\">changelog</a>.</p>\n<h1 id=\"revamped-jupyter-notebooks-experience\">Revamped Jupyter Notebooks Experience</h1>\n<p>In July 2020, <a href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/python/notebooks-are-getting-revamped/\">we had announced</a> the preview of the new experience for Jupyter notebooks in VS Code.

When there are many Python environments on a machine, this often led to additional steps for interpreter selection that involved searching and a lot of scrolling. To make that process faster, we are now displaying the list of interpreters in a way so that the one you are most likely to want for your project shows first on the list and is easier to find. The order in which they are now displayed is the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Environments located in the same path as the workspace root;</li>\n<li>Globally-installed environments (e.g. $WORK_ON or conda);</li>\n<li>Global installs (e.g. /usr/bin/python3.9)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The Python interpreters with higher versions for each of those categories are displayed first.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/python/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2021/08/InterpretersList.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8611\" src=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/python/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2021/08/InterpretersList.png\" alt=\"List of Python interpreters listed in the new sorting order\" width=\"1156\" height=\"640\" srcset=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/python/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2021/08/InterpretersList.png 1156w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/python/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2021/08/InterpretersList-300x166.png 300w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/python/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2021/08/InterpretersList-1024x567.png 1024w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/python/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2021/08/InterpretersList-768x425.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1156px) 100vw, 1156px\" /></a></p>\n<h1 id=\"other-changes-and-enhancements\">Other Changes and Enhancements</h1>\n<p>We also want to thank the following people who contributed this month to the Python extension in Visual Studio Code:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/bfarahdel\">@bfarahdel</a>: Sorted settings alphabetically (<a href=\"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-python/issues/8406\">#8406</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jasleen101010\">@jasleen101010</a>: Changed default language server to Pylance for extension development (<a href=\"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-python/issues/13007\">#13007</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/iChenLei\">@iChenLei</a>: Replaced deprecated vscode-test with @vscode/test-electron for CI.
