He was just hosting on his laptop and then forwarding a port but that means his friends can't connect unless he's actively running. I was running a Minecraft Server in a Docker container on my <a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://www.hanselman.com/blog/SynologyDS1520IsTheSweetSpotForAHomeNASAndAPrivateCloud.aspx\">Synology NAS</a> but I thought teaching him how to run Minecraft Server on a Raspberry Pi 4 we had lying around would be a good learning moment.</p> <p>First, set up your Raspberry Pi. I like <a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/noobs/\">NOOBS</a> as it's super easy to setup. If you want to make things faster for setup and possibly set up your Pi without having to connect a monitor, mouse, or keyboard, mount your SSD card and create a new empty file named ssh, without any extension, inside the boot directory to enable ssh on boot. Remember the default user name is pi and the password is raspberry.</p> <p>SSH over to your Raspberry Pi. You can use Putty, but I like using <a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://www.hanselman.com/blog/HowToUseWindows10sBuiltinOpenSSHToAutomaticallySSHIntoARemoteLinuxMachine.aspx\">Windows 10's built-in SSH</a>. Do your standard update stuff, and also install a JDK:</p><pre>sudo apt update\n<br>sudo apt upgrade\n<br>sudo apt install default-jdk</pre>\n<p>There are other Minecraft 3rd party Java Servers you can use, the most popular being Spigot, but the easiest server you can run is the one from Minecraft themselves.</p>\n<p>Go to <a title=\"\nhttps://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server\" href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server\">https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server</a> in a browser. It'll say something like \"Download <a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://launcher.mojang.com/v1/objects/c5f6fb23c3876461d46ec380421e42b289789530/server.jar\">minecraft_server.1.16.2.jar</a> and run it with the following command.\" That version number and URL will change in the future. Right-click and copy link into your clipboard We are going to PASTE it (right click with your mouse) after the \"wget\" below. So we'll make a folder, download the server.jar, then run it.</p><pre>cd ~\n<br>mkdir MinecraftServer\n<br>cd MinecraftServer\n<br>wget https://launcher.mojang.com/v1/objects/c5f6fb23c3876461d46ec380421e42b289789530/server.jar\n<br>java -Xmx2500M -Xms2500M -jar server.jar nogui</pre>\n<p>You'll get a warning that you didn't accept the EULA, so now open \"pico eula.txt\" and set eula=true, then hit Ctrl-X and Yes to save the new file. Press the up key and run your command again.</p><pre>java -Xmx2500M -Xms2500M -jar server.jar nogui</pre>\n<p>You could also make a start.sh text file with pico then chmod +x to make it an easier single command way to start your server. Since I have a Raspberry Pi 4 with 4g gigs of RAM and it'll be doing just this one server, I felt 2500 megs of RAM was a sweet spot. Java ran out of memory at 3 gigs.</p>\n<p>You can then run ifconfig at and command line and get your Pi's IP address, or type hostname to get its name. Then you can connect to your world with that name or ip.</p>\n<figure><img title=\"Running Minecraft Servers\" style=\"display: inline\" alt=\"Running Minecraft Servers\" src=\"https://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/How-to-use-a-Raspberry-Pi-4-as-a-Minecra_CC25/image_68d26916-6145-42ee-9bf7-4534ec5228ca.png\" width=\"856\" height=\"526\"></figure>\n<h3>Performance Issues with Complex Worlds</h3>\n<p>With very large Minecraft worlds or worlds like my son's with 500+ Iron Golems and Chickens, you may get an error like </p><pre>[Server Watchdog/FATAL]: A single server tick took 60.00 seconds (should be max 0.05)</pre>\n<p>You can workaround this in a few ways. You can gently overclock your Pi4 if it has a fan by adding this to the end of your /boot/config.txt (read articles on overclocking a Pi to be safe)</p><pre>over_voltage=3\n<br>arm_freq=1850</pre>\n<p>And/or you can disable the Minecraft internal watchdog for ticks by setting max-tick-time to -1 in your server's server.properties file. </p>\n<p>We solved our issue by killing about 480+ Iron Golems with </p><pre>/kill @e[type=minecraft:iron_golem]</pre>\n<p>but that's up to you. Just be aware that the Pi is fast but not thousands of moving entities in Minecraft fast. For us this works great though and is teaching my kids about the command line, editing text files, and ssh'ing into things. </p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Sponsor: </strong>Never miss a beat with Seq.

I checked my Amazon history, and I bought my Synology DS1511+ NAS in May of 2011! I have blogged about the joy of having a home server over these last nearly 10 years in a number of posts.</p> <ul> <li>I setup a <a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://www.hanselman.com/blog/ABasicNoncloudbasedPersonalBackupStrategy.aspx\">home backup strategy without the cloud</a>  <li>I later added <a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://www.hanselman.com/blog/UPDATED2014HowToSetupCrashPlanCloudBackupOnASynologyNASRunningDSM50.aspx\">CrashPlan Cloud Backup</a> and still use it.  <li>A few years back I <a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://www.hanselman.com/blog/SettingUpAVPNAndRemoteDesktopBackIntoYourHomeWithASynologyFromAnIPhone.aspx\">set up VPN on my Synology</a> as well an internal Git Server and a Minecraft Server for the kids  <li>I also setup <a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://www.hanselman.com/blog/PlexForXboxOneIsHereAndMyLifeIsCompletePlusSynologySetupHowto.aspx\">Plex for home movie</a> storage  <li>You can also run Docker images <a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://www.hanselman.com/blog/BlockingAdsBeforeTheyEnterYourHouseAtTheDNSLevelWithPiholeAndACheapRaspberryPi.aspx\">with things like Pi-Hole ad blocking</a></li></ul> <p>It's great to have a home server - it's a little slice of the cloud, in your home. I like home servers because while I trust the cloud, I trust a computer I can touch about 1% more than someone else's computer.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>NOTE: </strong>When I review gadgets and products, I often use Amazon Affiliate Links. I donate the small amount I make from you using these links, Dear Reader, to my kids' charter school. Thanks for using and clicking these links to support!</p></blockquote> <p>Anyway, my Synology DS1511+ is about ten years old and it's working great but I am using it more and more and throwing more and more at it. It did have some challenges running a Minecraft Server recently, on top of all its other responsibilities. </p> <p>I use Seagate 2TB disks and I run 4 of them in the 5 bay device, with a fifth drive as a hot spare. If a drive goes bad - which happens about every 2 to 3 years - the Synology will rebuild with the spare, then I pull the dead drive. I have two additional 2TB unopened Seagate Drives ready to go, so when this happens it's as close to a non-event as possible. </p><figure><a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://amzn.to/3h6y7lB\"><img title=\"Synology is amazing\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Synology is amazing\" src=\"https://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/7ac4cd437e69_146A7/image_061a461c-2714-4187-b93f-c52f791d8181.png\" width=\"1001\" height=\"496\"></a></figure>  <p>I have every digital photo and digital video and family document we've created since 1998.

It's basically a ten year's newer clone of my 1511+ workhorse, updated and refreshed! It's WAY faster. It was immediately noticeable on startup. File access is faster, indexing is faster, my Docker images start faster.</p> <p>Now, a little more money would <a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://amzn.to/3i632zF\">get you a 6 bay NAS</a> and just $150 will <a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://amzn.to/3haS0rn\">get you a 2 bay</a>, but I love the size and power of a 5 bay for our home and my office. Four disks are for my array and 1 is that hot swap drive. I think that for small businesses or home offices five bays is the perfect size and price - about $600-700 USD. </p> <p align=\"left\">The Synology 1520+ has 4 GbE network ports (which is nice with <a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://www.hanselman.com/blog/ReviewUniFiFromUbiquitiNetworkingIsTheUltimateProsumerHomeNetworkingSolution.aspx\">Link Aggregation</a> in a busy house), supports two eSATA externals (I use one to backup the backup to a single disk, as I believe in the <a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://www.hanselman.com/blog/TheComputerBackupRuleOfThree.aspx\">Backup Rule of Three</a> and you should, too!) and works with any SATA drives, 2.5\" or 3.5\". One of the big reasons that attracted me to this update is that there's slots for 2 x M.2 2280 NVMe SSDs for caching. I put a 512G M.2 drive in there to accelerate file system access.</p><figure><a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://amzn.to/3h6y7lB\"><img title=\"5 Drives in a Synology\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"5 Drives in a Synology\" src=\"https://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/7ac4cd437e69_146A7/image_159dfb72-5c8a-43d1-af86-b5981be9939d.png\" width=\"965\" height=\"641\"></a></figure>  <p align=\"left\">If you want, you can have up to 15 drives using two DX517 drive expanders up to 240TB, but with just 4 slots and large drives like Seagate Ironwolf drives in the 10TB to 18TB range, storage is really a non-issue.

You'll figure it out very quickly as it's all windows and wizards. I am a fan of the Cloud Sync feature that I use to backup my Google Drive, Dropbox, and One Drive.

Took 10 minutes. For movement between device families or to new drives <a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://www.synology.com/en-global/knowledgebase/DSM/tutorial/General_Setup/How_to_migrate_between_Synology_NAS_DSM_6_0_and_later\">there's at least three good options</a>.</p> <p>It was actually scarily simple, given there's ten years of history here. I moved the drives (maintaining order) and booted up the new 1520+ and was greeted with this screen:</p> <p><a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://amzn.to/3h6y7lB\"><img title=\"Migrate your Synology\" style=\"display: inline\" alt=\"Migrate your Synology\" src=\"https://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/7ac4cd437e69_146A7/image_ec7329bd-34bf-47e2-981f-a842b10e578b.png\" width=\"639\" height=\"478\"></a></p> <p>I clicked Migrate twice and was all set.</p> <p><img title=\"image\" style=\"display: inline\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/7ac4cd437e69_146A7/image_2a268607-144d-436c-91f1-43a4a08471de.png\" width=\"640\" height=\"291\"></p> <p>If you are migrating and upgrading, I'd be sure to <a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://www.synology.com/en-global/knowledgebase/DSM/tutorial/General_Setup/How_to_migrate_between_Synology_NAS_DSM_6_0_and_later#t2.1\">read the section on HDD Migration and look closely at the table, considering your Source and Destination NAS models</a>.</p> <p>So far this new Synology is WAY snappier, runs Docker faster, can run Virtual Machines now (although in 8 gigs, only small utility ones), and the SSD cache has made browsing family photos whip fast.

The kids and spouse are having their PCs backed up in the background, family photos and DVD backups are all available easily (and there are Synology iPhone apps as well to view the files).</p> <p>Synology devices specifically - and home NAS devices generally - are a great addition to techie homes. There's a bunch of 1st and 3rd party packages you can run on it to make it as much or little a part of your Home IT setup as you like. It can run DHCP and DNS, iTunes Servers, Mail, Chat Servers, or even their own web-based Office clients. Take a look at the <a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://amzn.to/3h6y7lB\">Synology 1520+</a> if you're in the market for a home or business NAS.
