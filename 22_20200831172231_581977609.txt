Here's what else research and experts suggest as of late June.&#160;</p><h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5da47f43cc4a0a3513408b05?format=jpeg\" alt=\"pregnant woman OB-GYN\" height=\"2000\" width=\"3000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">AP Photo/Teresa Crawford</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></h2><h2>Pregnant women don't seem especially susceptible to the illness, but racial disparities persist</h2><p>Pregnant women are at greater risk of severe morbidity and mortality from other respiratory infections like the flu, so they \"should be considered an <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/health-conditions-that-increase-risk-of-severe-coronavirus-infection-2020-3\">at-risk population for COVID-19</a>,\" according to the <a href=\"https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/practice-advisory/articles/2020/03/novel-coronavirus-2019\">American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists</a>.</p><p>Still, they don't seem be especially susceptible to COVID-19 the way age or conditions like lung or heart disease does, Dr. Jane van Dis, an OB-GYN who serves as medical director at the telemedicine network <a href=\"https://www.mavenclinic.com/\">Maven</a>, told Business Insider.&#160;</p><p>\"While I think pregnant women should practice every degree of social distancing that they can because that is just smart, I don't think pregnant women should feel a sense of panic,\" she said. \"We're just not seeing the data to show that the virus is attacking their immune system in the same way as someone, say, over the age of 70.\"</p><p>There is a racial disparity, however, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/cdc-pregnant-women-increased-risk-for-severe-coronavirus-cases-hospitalization-2020-6\">with an analysis out of the CDC</a> finding that Black and Hispanic pregnant women seem to be disproportionately affected by COVID-19.&#160;&#160;</p><p>All women and their families should do what they can to protect themselves from the illness.&#160;</p><p>That means taking social distancing seriously (van Dis recommends pregnant women have someone else get their groceries, for instance), <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-prevent-wuhan-coronavirus-hygiene-hand-washing-2020-2\">practicing excellent hygiene</a>, and avoiding anyone who seems sick.</p><p>Women should continue their prenatal visits but may consider making some virtual, said van Dis, whose platform digitally connects women to providers including maternal-fetal medicine specialists, midwives, doulas, mental-health providers, lactation consultants and more.&#160;</p><h2>If pregnant women do get COVID-19, they may be more likely to be hospitalized&#160;</h2><p>If pregnant women do get the virus, they may be at increased risk for hospitalization, ICU admission, and mechanical ventilation, according to the largest report of its type, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/cdc-pregnant-women-increased-risk-for-severe-coronavirus-cases-hospitalization-2020-6\">the same one out of the CDC June 25</a>.</p><p>It was unclear, however, if these hospitalizations were related to COVID-19 or pregnancy, labor, and delivery, so the findings should be interpreted cautiously. And, it was still rare for pregnant women to need serious care, with 1.5% admitted to the ICU and 0.5% put on ventilators.&#160;</p><p>This reflects an earlier investigation of 147 pregnant women in China who either had or were suspected to have COVID-19. It found that only 8% had severe cases and 1% had critical cases.&#160;</p><p>Women of color seem again to be more susceptible to severe illness, with&#160;<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/half-pregnant-women-in-uk-coronavirus-black-ethnic-minorities-2020-6\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"60\">another study out of the UK</a> finding more than half of pregnant women who were admitted to the hospital with COVID-19 were Black or from other minority ethnic groups.&#160;</p><p>Marian Knight, the study's lead, previously told Insider more qualitative research involving talking to women about their experiences is \"urgently needed\" to help understand what puts pregnant women of color at such risk for COVID-19.&#160;</p><h2>There is some evidence that pregnant women with COVID-19 could pass it to their babies in utero&#160;</h2><p>Prior to March 26, research suggested pregnant women with COVID-19 could not pass on the disease in utero.&#160;</p><p>A Lancet <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673620303603\">study</a> of nine pregnant women in Wuhan who had COVID-19, for one, found their babies tested negative. There was no evidence of the virus in breast milk, amniotic fluid, or cord blood, either.&#160;</p><p>And, of the 34 cases of babies born to women with COVID-19 that were discussed in a March 12 <a href=\"https://emergency.cdc.gov/coca/calls/2020/callinfo_031220.asp\">CDC seminar</a> for medical professionals, none tested positive for the illness.&#160;</p><p>But <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/pregnant-women-coronavirus-may-pass-covid-19-in-utero-2020-3\">a trio of studies out March 26</a> brought those conclusions into question, in part by showing how some babies still tested positive for COVID-19 when strict prevention measures were taken after birth.</p><p>In two of the studies, researchers found evidence of a certain antibody in some of the babies' blood with only one likely explanation: The coronavirus crossed through the placenta and prompted them to appear.</p><p>\"These two papers give evidence that COVID-19 can likely be vertically transmitted from a mother to her fetus,\" Dr. Jessica Madden, a pediatrician and neonatologist who serves as medical director of <a href=\"https://aeroflowbreastpumps.com/\">Aeroflow Breastpumps</a>, told Business Insider.&#160;</p><p>One <a href=\"https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/wk/inf/2020/00000039/00000009/art00011\">case report</a> out July 7 also described a pre-term infant who tested positive for the virus when they were two days old.&#160;</p><p>Still, it seems most babies born to COVID-positive mothers don't get infected, thanks to strict hospital protocols. Of the 24 babies born to COVID-positive moms in Los Angeles County, for instance, none <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-live-updates-latest-news\" data-analytics-module=\"summary_bullets\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"20\">tested positive for the virus</a>.&#160;</p><p>Even <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/a-small-new-study-suggests-the-coronavirus-damages-the-placenta-2020-5?r=US&IR=TIR=T\">a small study</a> finding placental damage, presumably due to the virus, in pregnant women, none of their babies acquired the illness.&#160;</p><h2>Babies and infants can be infected, 90% of the time they're asymptomatic or have mild symptoms&#160;</h2><p>While babies and children seem to be less vulnerable to the virus than adults, they can acquire the infection, and in some cases, it can be serious.&#160;</p><p>In a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/some-children-develop-severe-infections-from-coronavirus-2020-3?r=US&IR=TIR=T\">study out March 17 of 2,000 kids in China who were diagnosed with</a> COVID-19, researchers found that infants have the highest risk of developing severe or critical infections. Just over 10% of all infants in the study ended up in a severe condition, compared to 7% of kids aged one to five years old, 4% of six- to 10-year-olds, 4% of 11- to 15-year-olds, and 3% of older teenagers.</p><p>However, 90% of the children were either asymptomatic or had mild or moderate COVID-19 symptoms, like fever, fatigue, sore throat, cough, or shortness of breath.&#160;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5ce5a430df29c80f662e8033?format=jpeg\" alt=\"breast pump\" height=\"1415\" width=\"2119\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><h2>Delivering with COVID-19 can make other complications more likely, but babies can still be breastfed&#160;</h2><p>Like any respiratory illness, COVID-19 can make it more likely for pregnant women to have complications,&#160;namely preterm birth, according to the CDC.</p><p>Another <a href=\"http://tp.amegroups.com/article/view/35919/28274\">study</a> in the journal Translational Pediatrics of 10 Chinese newborns whose moms have COVID-19 found six developed shortness of breath, two had fever, two had abnormal platelets and liver function tests, and one experienced vomiting. One went into septic shock and died, Madden&#160;<a href=\"https://www.novamaemd.com/single-post/2020/03/07/What-do-we-know-about-COVID-19-and-newborns\">summarizes on her blog</a>.&#160;</p><p>But, like much of the research on the topic, the sample size was small and there's no way to know if those complications were caused by COVID-19 or other factors, or some combination.&#160;</p><p>Still, Madden wrote, pregnant women with COVID-19 should plan to give birth in a hospital, where they must follow CDC recommendations for managing them and their newborns to reduce the risk of transmission after birth. That may mean&#160;putting moms and their babies in separate isolation rooms, or keeping mom and newborn six feet apart, Madden said.&#160;</p><p>\"Each hospital is following the CDC's guidelines based on their own local resources and hospital censuses,\" she said.&#160;</p><p>After delivery, as of June 25 <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/pregnancy-breastfeeding.html\">the CDC still recommended</a> pregnant women with COVID-19 breastfeed because there's no proof that the virus can pass through breastmilk, though there is <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2769825\">some evidence</a> that the substance can carry the virus's RNA.&#160;</p><p>New moms with the virus should wear a mask, though, and naturally, wash their hands thoroughly beforehand.&#160;</p><p>\"If a woman wants to take extra precaution, think about pumping milk and then having someone else feed the baby,\" van Dis said.&#160;</p><h2>Seek help and support</h2><p>It's true that there's a lot experts don't know about how the novel coronavirus affects pregnant women and their babies, and it's natural to feel anxious about the unknown.</p><p>Pregnant women and new moms, who are already vulnerable to depression and anxiety, are experiencing remarkably high rates &#8212; 41% and 72% respectively &#8212; of those symptoms now, <a

Former Representative Mark Meadows took Mulvaney's role in the White House.

Stimulus progress and positive coronavirus drug news have repeatedly pushed major equity indexes higher in recent weeks despite continued economic pain, he said.</p><p>That trend will surely continue, and those with experience in government will know how to best position themselves with respect to future legislation and regulation, Mulvaney added.</p><p>\"Not a lot of folks get it. Not a lot of folks understand, OK, this person has hired this staffer to run this subcommittee, what is that going to mean for what kinds of legislation you're seeing come out?\" he said.</p><p>Mulvaney and Wessel began raising capital for the fund about a month ago, Wessel said on the podcast. The two aim to open the fund on January 1, and will do so whether Trump or Vice President Joe Biden wins November's presidential election.</p><p>Other government players moved into the market recently as stocks rebounded from their virus-induced lows.

Yes, there are many great resources out there. But a word of caution: look out for the following common pitfalls.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</p><h2><strong>Cost</strong></h2><p>Do you have a budget? Establish one up front. Include items like desks, chair, task light, ergonomic tools. Likely items are bookcase, file cabinet, and maybe rug or flooring material. Also consider accessories such as artwork and plants as they can enhance overall well-being in the space.&#160;&#160;&#160;</p><h2><strong>Size&#160;</strong></h2><p>Grab a tape measure and test out what new furniture will look like in the space.&#160; Consider taping it out on the floor with masking tape or cutting out newspaper or a cardboard box the size you are considering.&#160;&#160;</p><h2><strong>Ergonomic factors</strong></h2><p>We are all spending more time in our home offices. Comfort is important, and good ergonomic solutions are even more essential. Do you need a desk and task chair? Or would you benefit from soft seating, like a lounge chair or sofa for some of your work?</p><p>Do you like to stand up and work? Maybe a bar height table and stools make more sense for you.&#160;</p><h2><strong>Location</strong>&#160;</h2><p>Does your home office space have enough light? Will you be on video calls? Natural light can always improve how we look over video. Seek out light sources from a variety of angles. Avoid all down lighting. You want to make sure to provide the best representation of yourself on video.</p><p>Consider the animals in your home: Do they find your workspace cozy too? I'm allergic to cats, but I get a kick out of seeing my co-worker's furry friends jump into the view of the camera. Having an animal join our calls has been a nice treat on occasion.</p><p>Take intp account the noise near your home office workspace; if you are on a morning conference call, will the sound of your toddler in the background alarm your coworkers?</p><p>Consider the temperature of your office space: Is it hot, will you need to add a fan or something to circulate the air? Will the noise of the fan get picked up on conference calls and sound like a jet?&#160;&#160;</p><h2><strong>Connectivity</strong></h2><p>Do you need power/data cords? I miss my motorized sit-to-stand desk at the office. Consider cord lengths and distance from wall outlets. Will you need to connect to printer, screen, speakers, camera, etc.? You don't want to create deathly tripping hazards or risks of overloading electrical outlets/circuits.</p><p>I found my internet speed improved by connecting an ethernet cable directly into the router. If you can place your workspace as close to the router you may minimize future technology headaches.&#160;&#160;&#160;</p><h2><strong>Product</strong></h2><p>Where is the product coming from? What is involved with shipping and handling?&#160; Most office furniture today is blended with parts from around the globe. Does the company have customer support here in the US?&#160;&#160;</p><h2><strong>Freight</strong>&#160;</h2><p>Is the product insured as it goes from the factory to your home? What if there's freight damage? It's rare, but something to consider, with unknown shipping sources.</p><p>Stick to a reliable company that provides insurance, like the US Postal Service, UPS, FedEx, etc. How much time will it take you to chase down the right part?&#160;&#160;</p><h2><strong>Assembly</strong></h2><p>Does it require you putting it together? Do you have the right skill set, tools and patience to assemble the new furniture?&#160; If not, it's critical to find someone who can help in an affordable and efficient manner.</p><h2><strong>Warranty</strong></h2><p>What happens if your new furniture is all set up and a few weeks pass, and something breaks? Read the fine print; what is the warranty on the product you are purchasing?&#160;&#160;&#160;</p><h2><strong>Care and maintenance</strong></h2><p>You want your furniture to last and be germ free as much as possible. Wood is always a nice feature for desks, but are you willing to take care and responsibility for it?</p><p>Are you like me, who often eats lunch at my desk? Maybe plastic laminate or metal surfaces are more logical for your space.&#160; &#160;</p><p>I suspect we will be working from home in some form or fashion in the coming months, so it's important to have a well thought out home office furniture solution. We love our families and roommates, but it's beneficial to have a quiet place to break away in your home.</p><p>Also, you may find yourself using your home office workspace for other uses (paying bills, making out grocery lists, meal planning, writing letters, etc.). Flexible and adaptable solutions are valuable in more ways in one.</p><p><strong><em>Amie T.

The best way to keep all those things together is to use a wallet. The humble folded leather wallet for cards and cash has seen something of a reinvention of late, with a new wave of smart wallets hitting the market.</p><p>You may be wondering why you need your wallet to be smart. Well, what happens when your wallet goes missing? Many smart wallets offer tracking capabilities, so you can get a warning if you leave it behind and track its location on a map on your phone. Another common feature is protection from RFID skimming to prevent criminals from stealing card information.&#160;</p><p>New smart wallet designs also allow for quick card removal, special compartments, and other extras. I've been testing out various smart wallets, reading up on reviews and user impressions, and compiling a list that includes a smart wallet to suit anyone. These are the best smart wallets, from the feature-packed to the minimalist, with a few that fall somewhere in between.&#160;</p><p>Before we get started, it's worth noting that you can always buy a tracker, like the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/tile-slim-tracker-review-2018-6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tile Slim</a> or Chipolo Card, and slip it into any of the wallets listed here that lack built-in tracking, any of our picks of the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-wallet-men?r=US&IR=TIR=T\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">best men's wallets</a>, or any other wallet you like.</p><h2>Here are the best smart wallets:</h2><ul class=\"summary-list\"><li><strong>Best smart wallet overall: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PWKM24K/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=biipgf_073120_best-smart-wallets-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B07PWKM24K&linkId=806c9b6a72ee709458d473d4e74dc55c72ee709458d473d4e74dc55c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Ekster Parliament</a><br ></strong></li><li><strong>Best minimalist smart wallet: <a href=\"https://noduscollection.com/collections/wallets/products/compact-card?variant=7980110086199\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nodus Compact Card</a><br ></strong></li><li><strong>Best slim smart wallet with tracking: <a href=\"https://www.pntra.com/t/TUJGRUVORUJGSEhLR01CRkZOSE1L?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fproducts%2Fslim-wallet-tile\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Nomad Slim Wallet Tile Tracking Edition</a><br ></strong></li><li><strong>Best modular smart wallet: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07BSDR9T4/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=biipgf_073120_best-smart-wallets-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B07BSDR9T4&linkId=7720bc1c1d7c557d226d5e056eefeecb1d7c557d226d5e056eefeecb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Pitaka MagEZ Wallet</a><br ></strong></li><li><strong>Best smart wallet for travel: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07DZN93JB/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=biipgf_073120_best-smart-wallets-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B07DZN93JB&linkId=0caf532ac29f580479c54799fb95c610c29f580479c54799fb95c610\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Bellroy Travel Wallet</a></strong></li></ul>\n<div id=\"slideshow\">\n\tThe best smart wallet overall\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f2442362618b959e27a1152?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Ekster_Parliament_Smart_Wallet\" height=\"3024\" width=\"4032\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Simon Hill/INSIDER</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<h3><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PWKM24K/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipgf_073120_best-smart-wallets-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B07PWKM24K&#38;linkId=806c9b6a72ee709458d473d4e74dc55c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">The innovative Ekster Parliament</a> combines quick access to cards, location tracking capability, and RFID blocking in a stylish leather finish.&#160;</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PWKM24K/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipgf_073120_best-smart-wallets-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B07PWKM24K&#38;linkId=806c9b6a72ee709458d473d4e74dc55c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">This compact smart wallet</a> has a distinctive look and all the features that most people are likely to want. The premium leather exterior comes in a choice of seven different colors. The first thing you'll likely notice is the trigger mechanism, which pops up the cards in the aluminum cardholder and fans them for quick and easy access to the one you need.</p><p>Open the wallet and you'll find two card slots in the cover and an elastic strap for holding notes. The aluminum cardholder has room for four or five cards, blocks RFID signals, and ensures that your cards never get bent. On the back there's an external pocket which is where you'll keep the optional Chipolo tracking card, specially made in partnership with Ekster and bearing the classy Ekster logo.&#160;</p><p>This tracking card plugs into Chipolo's network of tracking devices, has a range of 200 feet, and works via the Chipolo app for Android or iOS. It's quick and easy to set up an account. The mobile app allows you to ping the tracker card, so it plays a sound to help you find your wallet in a hurry. You can also press the button on the tracker card to ring your phone if you've misplaced it.&#160;</p><p>Chipolo is a popular tracking service, so it has worldwide coverage. If you can't find your wallet at the last known location on the map, you can mark it as lost, and there's a chance that another Chipolo user could turn up the location. You can also set out of range alerts, so your phone will ping if you leave your wallet behind. There's even support for Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa, so you can ask either voice assistant where your wallet is and have it ring or tell you the last known location.</p><p>Of all the smart wallets I've tested, this is the one I keep coming back to. The tracking via Chipolo is handy, as it's a service I already use with my keys, so I can track both items from the same app. The out of range alert has saved me from leaving my wallet in a friend's couch and on a caf&#233; table. I also love the look of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PWKM24K/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipgf_073120_best-smart-wallets-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B07PWKM24K&#38;linkId=806c9b6a72ee709458d473d4e74dc55c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">this wallet</a>, but the trigger that pops the cards up is probably my most appreciated feature. No more fumbling to pull a card out of your wallet at the bar or checkout, pull the trigger and there it is.&#160;</p><p>On the downside, there isn't a lot of room for cash here. I find a single note or two will sit happily behind the strap, but if you have a lot of cash it pushes the cover open and this is already quite a thick wallet. You also have to charge the tracker from time to time. The battery life is around two to three months, depending on how often you use the location features. There's a tiny solar panel on the tracker, so if you remember to occasionally leave it in the sun it stays topped up, but this does require you to remove it from the wallet occasionally.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PWKM24K/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipgf_073120_best-smart-wallets-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B07PWKM24K&#38;linkId=806c9b6a72ee709458d473d4e74dc55c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">The Ekster Parliament wallet</a> costs $89.00 and you can add the tracker card for $29.00, making it $118 in total. That may sound pricey for a wallet, but as the best smart wallet you can get, it's worth it. Ekster offers free returns and a one-year warranty.</p><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Premium leather, quick card access, tracking via Chipolo, RFID protection, strap for cash, compact</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>Tracker needs to be charged, quite thick</p>\n\tThe best minimalist smart wallet\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f24427a7924a1280434fb65?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Nodus_Compact_Card_Wallet\" height=\"3024\" width=\"4032\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Simon Hill/INSIDER</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<h3>When you want to travel light, <a href=\"https://noduscollection.com/collections/wallets/products/compact-card?variant=7980110086199\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the Nodus Compact Card wallet</a> is the perfect companion.&#160;</h3><p>For everyday use, most of us don't need a big fat wallet. If you prefer something slim and minimal, <a href=\"https://noduscollection.com/collections/wallets/products/compact-card?variant=7980110086199\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the Nodus Compact Card</a> is perfect. The finish is full grain vegetable tanned Italian leather and it comes in four colors. The stylish octopus Nodus logo completes a classy look.</p><p>There's a slot for a card or two on each side, with an internal pocket for cash, which also has a key holder notch for a single key. You can fit everything you need for a night out in <a href=\"https://noduscollection.com/collections/wallets/products/compact-card?variant=7980110086199\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this compact wallet</a>. It measures just 3.8 inches by 2.5 inches, so it slips easily into any pocket, even if you're wearing skinny jeans.</p><p>One side of the wallet is RFID shielded to protect your cards and the other is RFID enabled, so you can pay at contactless terminals without having to take your card out of the wallet at all. Just make sure the shielded side is facing out when you slip this wallet into your pocket, and you're safe from RFID skimming.</p><p>Tracking is not part of the package, but you could easily add a Tile Slim or a Chipolo Card into the central pocket if you wanted to.&#160;</p><p><a href=\"https://noduscollection.com/collections/wallets/products/compact-card?variant=7980110086199\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Compact Card Wallet</a> is quite expensive at $55. If you like the look of this, but feel you need a bit more room, then check out the Nodus Compact Wallet, as it adds room for more cards and cash. Nodus wallets finally come with a two-year warranty.</p><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Premium leather, slim, minimalist, RFID shielding, key pocket</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>Limited space, no built-in tracking</p>\n\tThe best slim smart wallet with tracking\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f2443347924a12861014429?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Nomad_Slim_Wallet_with_Tile_Tracking\" height=\"3024\" width=\"4032\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Simon Hill/INSIDER</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<h3>A stylish, traditional-looking, leather, folding wallet, <a href=\"https://www.pntra.com/t/TUJGRUVORUJGSEhLR01CRkZOSE1L?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fproducts%2Fslim-wallet-tile\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored\">the Nomad Slim Wallet</a> has a hidden pocket with a Tile tracker inside and space for lots of cards.&#160;</h3><p>Fans of the traditional folding leather look will love <a href=\"https://www.pntra.com/t/TUJGRUVORUJGSEhLR01CRkZOSE1L?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fproducts%2Fslim-wallet-tile\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">this smart wallet from Nomad</a>. It's finished in beautiful brown or black leather from Chicago-based tannery, Horween, which dates to 1905. That quality leather is combined with smart tracking via the Tile Slim, which is included in a hidden pocket.</p><p>This looks like a classic bifold wallet and has a single exterior pocket on the back. Open it up and you'll find the Nomad and Horween brands embossed in the cover along with four card slots. The other side offers space for another card and maybe a folded bill or two. On closer inspection, there's an elastic liner that can be peeled back to reveal a Tile Slim tracking device inside.</p><p>A concealed, stealth pocket is cool, and could conceivably pull double duty for other contents, but it's a particularly smart move for a tracker, because you don't want thieves to notice and discard it.&#160;</p><p>You'll need the Tile app for Android or iOS to pair with <a href=\"https://www.pntra.com/t/TUJGRUVORUJGSEhLR01CRkZOSE1L?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fproducts%2Fslim-wallet-tile\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">your Tile Slim</a>, but it's very easy to set up. This is the older model of the Tile Slim tracker, which has a 100-foot range and 1-year battery life. There's a button on the center of <a href=\"https://www.pntra.com/t/TUJGRUVORUJGSEhLR01CRkZOSE1L?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fproducts%2Fslim-wallet-tile\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">the Tile Slim</a> that you can double press through the wallet to ring your phone. You can also use the app to ring <a href=\"https://www.pntra.com/t/TUJGRUVORUJGSEhLR01CRkZOSE1L?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fproducts%2Fslim-wallet-tile\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">the Tile Slim</a> and find your wallet, and it has a kind of proximity sensor with concentric circles to give you a visual of how close you are.</p><p>The Tile app also shows you the last known location on a map. If you're prepared to pay for a Tile Premium subscription, which is $2.99 per month or $29.99 for the year, you can get geofencing alerts to warn you when you leave your wallet behind somewhere and 30-day location history. Sadly, this Tile Slim model doesn't have a replaceable battery, but you should get a discounted price on a new tracker when your battery runs out through the reTile program. Tile also supports both Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa, so you can have your wallet or phone ring using Tile with either voice assistant.&#160;</p><p>This is a gorgeous wallet with enough room to satisfy most people, and I really appreciate the stealth pocket. It looks and feels just like a traditional leather wallet, which is ideal if you'd rather not draw attention and you want to boost your chances of the tracker inside going unnoticed by a thief.</p><p>All that's missing here, in the way of common smart wallet features, is RFID shielding. <a href=\"https://www.pntra.com/t/TUJGRUVORUJGSEhLR01CRkZOSE1L?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fproducts%2Fslim-wallet-tile\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">The Nomad Slim Wallet</a> with Tile Tracking is fairly expensive at $79.95, but that includes the Tile Slim tracker. You could also buy just the wallet for $59.95 and add a Chipolo or another tracker instead. Nomad wallets come with a two-year warranty.&#160;</p><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Premium leather, slim design, plenty of space, hidden pocket, Tile Slim tracker included, reasonable price</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>No RFID shielding, some Tile features require subscription, can't recharge Tile Slim</p>\n\tThe best modular smart wallet\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f244384aee6a82f687a94b2?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Pitaka_MagEZ_Wallet\" height=\"3024\" width=\"4032\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Simon Hill/INSIDER</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<h3>Finished in futuristic carbon fiber with a magnetic modular design, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07BSDR9T4/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipgf_073120_best-smart-wallets-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B07BSDR9T4&#38;linkId=7720bc1c1d7c557d226d5e056eefeecb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">the Pitaka MagEZ wallet</a> is truly unique.</h3><p>If you want your smart wallet to make a statement, then <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07BSDR9T4/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipgf_073120_best-smart-wallets-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B07BSDR9T4&#38;linkId=7720bc1c1d7c557d226d5e056eefeecb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">the Pitaka MagEZ wallet</a> is certain to catch your eye. This is an incredibly lightweight magnetic carbon wallet that features a modular design, enabling you to add extra layers for cards, a money clip, or a box for keys or maybe a tracker.&#160;</p><p>Finished in genuine carbon fiber, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07BSDR9T4/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipgf_073120_best-smart-wallets-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B07BSDR9T4&#38;linkId=7720bc1c1d7c557d226d5e056eefeecb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">this wallet</a> really stands out from the crowd. The first thing you'll notice is that it's very light, weighing in at just 54 grams. The various sections of the wallet are held together with magnets and can slide apart to reveal space to securely store up to six cards. It's quite easy to quickly slide open to the card you need, once you get the hang of it, but it does feel as though the whole wallet is going to come apart at first. You can pull the layers completely apart, as they are only held together by magnets.</p><p>Apart from the worry that you may accidentally drop layers trying to open it, which evaporates once you get used to how this wallet works, the magnets also mean you can't use magnetic swipe cards with this wallet. However, chip and PIN, contactless cards, and IDs are fine. There is also RFID shielding to keep your cards safe from skimming.&#160;</p><p>This is a fun, if slightly strange smart wallet. It is quite boxy, especially if you add extra layers and the hard construction, though very light, isn't the most comfortable thing in your pocket. On the other hand, it ensures that your cards never get bent accidentally.&#160;</p><p>The standard <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07BSDR9T4/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipgf_073120_best-smart-wallets-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B07BSDR9T4&#38;linkId=7720bc1c1d7c557d226d5e056eefeecb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Pitaka MagEZ wallet</a> comes with space for six cards and costs $80. You can get your name, or some other text engraved on a metal plate on the top layer for an extra $10. Extra layers for cards cost $25 each, the money clip costs $30, and the versatile box layer is $35. It also comes with a limited lifetime warranty.</p><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Carbon fiber finish, magnetic design, modular system, RFID shielding, sleek and lightweight</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>Uncomfortable in pocket, no built-in tracking</p>\n\tThe best smart wallet for travel\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f298823aee6a84d484bdc10?format=jpeg\" alt=\"bellroy travel wallet\" height=\"842\" width=\"1123\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Bellroy</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<h3>The thoughtfully designed <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07DZN93JB/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipgf_073120_best-smart-wallets-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B07DZN93JB&#38;linkId=0caf532ac29f580479c54799fb95c610\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Bellroy Travel Wallet</a> is packing everything you need for a smooth trip.&#160;&#160;</h3><p>Travel is stressful and it requires you to have a lot of things at your fingertips.

And now we're piling a lot of debt on top of that,\" said Cooperman.&#160;</p><p>He added that the stock market rally, which has been driven by the Fed, may lose momentum as the coronavirus pandemic recession continues on, hurting the US economy and businesses. He also pointed out that Japan and Europe have had zero or negative interest rates for some time, but their price-earnings ratios are lower than in the US.&#160;</p><p>\"What people have to understand is that the Fed is pursuing this zero-interest rate policy not because things are good in the economy,\" said Cooperman. \"They're pursuing a zero-interest rate policy because things are bad in the

Every time they come out of the wash, they're the first pair I put on for a workout or day of running errands. The material is silky and soft, the stretch is just enough to hold them in place without digging, and they're breathable without being sheer. They're definitely best for anything that involves bending or stretching a lot (they were designed for doing yoga, obviously), but I've worn them running plenty of times and they held up really well.</p><p>The 7/8 version fits like full-length leggings on me, but the capri version is my favorite since they fit like ankle leggings on my five-foot frame.&#160;</p><p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> It's been ten months since I first tried these leggings and I'm still deeply obsessed. So much so that I've thrown out most of my other leggings and bought another pair of these.</p><p>The sheen has sort of faded in the wash after all this time, but that's probably because I haven't followed the hand-washing directions, nor do I ever remember to turn the leggings inside out before machine-washing. Kind of my own fault.

They're buttery smooth and feel great on your legs, and they stretch very well. You can and should take advantage of the variety of color options because they're a nice change from traditional black. Although I'm of average height (5-foot-6), my legs are on the shorter side, so I found with this legging length that some fabric did bunch up &#8212; I had to choose between my ankle or knee areas.

Typically, when I see performance gear being billed as \"studio-to-street,\" I assume that's code for athleisure rather than gear that's actually compatible with hot, sweaty cardio sessions. But Alo's High-Waist Airlift Capri ($114) impressed me &#8212; the four-way stretch fabric fits like a flexible, breathable second-skin during exercise, and I've used them far more frequently for HIIT than I have for streetwear.</p><p>They're also, admittedly, pretty flattering. The creamy, silky material isn't stuffy and compressive, but it still manages to lengthen the silhouette into a lean, seamless shape. Or, as Alo puts it, they're \"engineered to lift, sculpt, contour and smooth.\" They're not exactly Spanx, but when I put them on for the first time my first thought was, \"Ah, I get why celebrities wear these so much now.\"&#160;</p><p>The one thing I'd note is that the capris run a little long, meaning they're still great for my 5'7 frame, but may end up being full-length for petites. And while I didn't notice sweat showing through on the dark cherry color I tested, other reviews mentioned seeing the sweat in lighter colors.&#160;</p><p>The price is steep at $118, and I've <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/girlfriend-collective-lite-breathable-leggings-review-2018-7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">found cheaper options that are just as breathable</a>, but, if you're thinking of getting them, I'd wager you'll love them. <strong>&#8212;Mara Leighton, senior reporter</strong></p>\n</div><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

avoided a more serious accident when it landed short and collided with a traffic sign during an expedient tactical airstrip training exercise on Thursday, August 27, 2020, in Ukraine.</p><p>The unusual accident occurred on a closed portion of the M06 international highway between Kyiv and the Hungarian Border near the city of Chop. The area was being used for a training simulation that demonstrated the use of \"twelve fighters\" on an improvised, forward dispersed highway landing area according to a report on unian.info.</p><p>The aircraft were reported to be from the Ukrainian \"39th Tactical Aviation Brigade\" according to the report. A quote attributed to a Ukrainian military source on the media outlet said, \"These skills will come in handy for war pilots in the event of a large-scale enemy invasion.\"</p><p>Reports of the incident surfaced on Twitter and from reporter Dylan Malyasov of the <a href=\"https://defence-blog.com/news/ukrainian-air-force-exercise-almost-ends-in-disaster.html\">defence-blog.com</a>. A number of people in the area took photos and video of the incident, which immediately circulated across social media.</p><p>The roadway had been prepared for the tactical exercise in advance by removing some road signs and lamp posts in the planned landing area. Police also blocked access to the roadway. Pyrotechnics were also set off to scare birds away from the area to prevent bird-strike.</p><p>The aircraft that collided with the traffic sign may have made a short approach for an unknown reason. A second Su-27 can be seen in one video immediately behind the first making a longer approach and rejected landing as two additional Su-27s fly overhead in echelon formation as if entering a landing pattern.</p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQYtmnHH4vA\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KV3aNi_6AyI\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2wIPo2hOQ_c\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>A photo in several social media posts and news reports showed the Su-27 involved in the incident, apparently back at an airfield, with the bent traffic sign wrapped around the intake inlet on the aircraft's left side.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet blockquote\" data-lang=\"en\" data-cards=\"\" data-conversation=\"\">&#8212;Defence Blog  (@Defence_blog) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mims/statuses/1299370429740650496?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 28, 2020</a></blockquote><script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script><p>Many Russian-built aircraft, such the MiG-29, are equipped with a ventilated cover <a href=\"https://theaviationist.com/2012/07/16/yak-130/\">that lowers over their intakes at landing speeds to prevent the ingestion of foreign objects into the engine</a> when operating from unimproved areas such as a highway or field.</p><p>The Su-27 involved in this incident did not appear to be equipped with an anti-foreign object damage cover on its intakes, meaning the aircraft's engine could have sustained damage had the sign gone directly into the intake instead of being lodged on its edge.</p><p>A similar incident, occurred to one A-10C Thunderbolt II aircraft assigned to the 104th Fighter Squadron, Maryland Air National Guard, during landing and take off training from an <a href=\"https://theaviationist.com/2017/08/10/u-s-a-10-thunderbolt-ii-jets-practice-take-off-and-landing-on-highway-in-estonia/\">extension of J&#228;gala-K&#228;ravete Highway</a>, a portion of the longer road known as Piibe Highway, in Northern Estonia, on August 10, 2017.

department. This is usually a result of the thinness of modern TVs squeezing out the physical room that quality speakers need.</p><p>As a solution, companies like Polk offer a variety of soundbars, providing an external audio solution in a simplified package that takes up less space than a full speaker system. One of Polk's latest entries in the soundbar department is the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B089HY2K1R/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=biip_082820_polk-signa-s3-soundbar-review-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B089HY2K1R&linkId=3d3a624c4bc9c71b653e92e8c5b763dc4bc9c71b653e92e8c5b763dc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Signa S3</a>.</p><p>Debuting at $250, the compelling soundbar package includes a wireless subwoofer and built-in Chromecast functionality. Its sleek and minimal design fits a multitude of home decors and its sound is aimed at delivering a step up from built-in TV speakers.</p><p>I've been testing the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B089HY2K1R/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=biip_082820_polk-signa-s3-soundbar-review-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B089HY2K1R&linkId=3d3a624c4bc9c71b653e92e8c5b763dc4bc9c71b653e92e8c5b763dc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Polk Signa S3</a> to see if this $250 soundbar offers satisfying performance while watching movies or listening to music. Is this a worthwhile upgrade to your TV's integrated speakers, or should you spend more for a higher end audio solution? Check out our full review below for all the details.</p><h2>Design</h2><p>At just over two inches tall, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B089HY2K1R/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=biip_082820_polk-signa-s3-soundbar-review-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B089HY2K1R&linkId=3d3a624c4bc9c71b653e92e8c5b763dc4bc9c71b653e92e8c5b763dc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Signa S3 soundbar</a> can definitely be called minimal. Its low profile, black and grey colors, and slightly curved front also make it attractive. There's nothing controversial about its design that will make it stand out, regardless of your home decor.</p><p>The Polk S3 soundbar unit and its matching subwoofer are perfectly subtle in their visual look. In fact, I would argue that the only downside to the system's styling is that it might look too bland or boring for some people. Personally, I like its dark, heathered front-facing look.&#160;</p><p>Beyond just the visual design, I'm also a fan of the materials used. Along the back is black plastic and the front is mesh fabric. Soundbars get dusty and sometimes using fabric on electronics can make them harder to clean. In this case, the Signa S3's fabric is taught and I find it easy to dust and wipe clean.</p><p>Another nice thing about its physical design are the buttons along the top. These are actual buttons, rather than touch-sensitive areas, and while it may be a cost-saving measure by Polk, I think they work well. In the back, the HDMI ARC and optical port are both placed at an angle so the soundbar can be pushed back flush against a wall or be mounted using the built-in hooks.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B089HY2K1R/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=biip_082820_polk-signa-s3-soundbar-review-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B089HY2K1R&linkId=3d3a624c4bc9c71b653e92e8c5b763dc4bc9c71b653e92e8c5b763dc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored\"><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f493a8960bf1f0028079396?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Polk Soundbar\" height=\"1115\" width=\"1487\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Tyler Hayes/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></a></h2><h2>Specifications</h2><p><strong>Soundbar</strong></p><ul><li>Frequency response: 45 Hz - 20,000 Hz</li><li>Front array driver: two 1.25\" midrange and two 1\" tweeters</li><li>Remote type: Infrared (IR)</li><li>Dimensions: 2.15\" x 35.43\" x 3.22\"</li><li>Audio inputs: HDMI (ARC), Toslink Optical, analog 3.5mm mini-jack (AUX)</li><li>Wireless connectivity: Bluetooth, Chromecast</li></ul><p><strong>Subwoofer&#160;</strong></p><ul><li>Front array driver: 5.25\"</li><li>Dimensions: 13.4\" x 6.72\" x 12.2\"</li></ul><h2><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B089HY2K1R/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=biip_082820_polk-signa-s3-soundbar-review-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B089HY2K1R&linkId=3d3a624c4bc9c71b653e92e8c5b763dc4bc9c71b653e92e8c5b763dc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\"><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f493b117ffa48002894ce12?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Polk Soundbar\" height=\"1107\" width=\"1477\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Tyler Hayes/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></a></h2><h2>Features</h2><p>Despite the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B089HY2K1R/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=biip_082820_polk-signa-s3-soundbar-review-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B089HY2K1R&linkId=3d3a624c4bc9c71b653e92e8c5b763dc4bc9c71b653e92e8c5b763dc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Signa S3's</a> reasonable price, the soundbar still includes plenty of features that may help it win out over its competition. The biggest headlining feature is built-in Chromecast support. This allows you to cast (beam, transport, throw, or however else you want to describe it) audio from an app on your phone directly to the soundbar over Wi-Fi. This feature is easier to use than Bluetooth and is reminiscent of AirPlay functionality.</p><p>Chromecast technology is capable of sending audio and video, but in this case the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B089HY2K1R/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=biip_082820_polk-signa-s3-soundbar-review-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B089HY2K1R&linkId=3d3a624c4bc9c71b653e92e8c5b763dc4bc9c71b653e92e8c5b763dc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">S3</a> only utilizes the audio function. To use this feature you'll need to set it up inside the Google Home app on iOS or Android. Once that's done, Chromecast support will be available in the Home app or from an audio app with the cast symbol.</p><p>A good example of this feature is Spotify. Open the Spotify mobile app, tap on a song, and then in the lower left hand corner tap the speaker icon and select the Polk soundbar. Ultimately, streaming audio this way should provide better quality than Bluetooth, and using this method won't stop the music if another audio source comes up on your phone.</p><p>Of course, the soundbar also includes Bluetooth connectivity. This function works well and I haven't had any problems connecting to a smartphone or tablet after tapping the Bluetooth button on the soundbar.</p><h2>Performance</h2><p>No matter how great a soundbar may look or how many features it packs in for its price, the value of adding one to your TV really comes down to how it sounds. To that end, right up front, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B089HY2K1R/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=biip_082820_polk-signa-s3-soundbar-review-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B089HY2K1R&linkId=3d3a624c4bc9c71b653e92e8c5b763dc4bc9c71b653e92e8c5b763dc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Polk Signa S3</a> sounds pretty good.</p><p>The midrange soundbar doesn't sound as detailed and rich as the more expensive <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/sonos-arc-soundbar-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sonos Arc</a>, but it does sound pretty amazing compared to the tiny speaker systems that you'll find stuffed into very thin TV sets.</p><p>The soundbar itself contains four drivers, each around one inch in size, which power the system's forward firing sound. As you might expect, if using the soundbar without the included subwoofer, the device's playback can sound a bit hollow. The sub, with its five-inch driver, provides a well-rounded low-end to lift the soundbar to an acceptable level.&#160;</p><p>Using the included remote, you're able to adjust the volume of the soundbar and the subwoofer independently. Overall, this option is a nice inclusion, but it does mean that it can be quite easy for things to get out of whack as you experiment with finding just the right balance between the two.</p><p>One of the main reasons you might want a soundbar is to improve the way dialogue sounds in movies and TV shows. If you're needing to raise the volume to a loud level to hear people speaking, you're a good candidate to add a soundbar to your home theater setup. To that point, a highlight of the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Polk-Audio-Signa-S3-Ultra-Slim/dp/B089HY2K1R/\">S3</a> is its preset equalizer (EQ) settings designed to help with dialogue.&#160;</p><p>On the remote, there are six buttons dedicated to different sound settings. Three of the settings are for enhancing voice and boosting the frequency range for speaking. The others include modes for nighttime, movies, and music.</p><p>The voice settings are great for their intended purpose. Of course, in order to enhance dialogue there's always a trade-off in overall performance. When you use one of the voice settings, the soundbar removes bass in order to highlight the frequency of human speech. As a result, you can hear dialogue better, but the overall sound quality is thinner than usual. The music and movie settings get closer to a well-rounded mix, each highlighting elements important to those experiences.</p><p>Beyond the independent volume settings for the soundbar and subwoofer, and the six preset EQ modes, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B089HY2K1R/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=biip_082820_polk-signa-s3-soundbar-review-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B089HY2K1R&linkId=3d3a624c4bc9c71b653e92e8c5b763dc4bc9c71b653e92e8c5b763dc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Signa S3</a> doesn't offer much in the way of sound adjustments &#8212; what you hear is what you get. For the average household picking up this soundbar, the amount of control should be sufficient. If you crave more tweaking options, however, there's a good chance you're a candidate for a higher end speaker set.</p><p>The volume can get quite loud on the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B089HY2K1R/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=biip_082820_polk-signa-s3-soundbar-review-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B089HY2K1R&linkId=3d3a624c4bc9c71b653e92e8c5b763dc4bc9c71b653e92e8c5b763dc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Signa S3</a>. Depending on the room size and other video factors,&#160; I doubt most people will ever need to go above the 50% volume level. Raising the level is also where you begin to hear some of the inadequacies of the small drivers. As the volume raises the separation of high and low frequencies becomes clearer, and the upper frequencies begin to distort. At normal volume levels, however, this isn't really a notable issue.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B089HY2K1R/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=biip_082820_polk-signa-s3-soundbar-review-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B089HY2K1R&linkId=3d3a624c4bc9c71b653e92e8c5b763dc4bc9c71b653e92e8c5b763dc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\"><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f493af07ffa48002894ce0f?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Polk Sound system\" height=\"1129\" width=\"1506\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Tyler Hayes/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></a></h2><h2>The bottom line</h2><p>Now that you can find decent <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-tv-under-500-dollars\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">50-inch TVs for just $400</a>, throwing a $250 soundbar into the mix can seem like a pricey addition.

It comes with a 5-quart stainless steel bowl that can mix dough for up to four loaves of bread or nine dozen cookies in one batch. This stand mixer includes a six-wire whisk attachment, coated flat beater, one-piece pouring shield, and coated dough hook, and you can also choose from 10 other attachments to turn your mixer into a&nbsp; food grinder, pasta maker, and more.</p>\n <p>There are more than 20 colors available, so there's definitely an option that matches the décor of your kitchen. Red is by far the most popular based on our empirical observations.</p>\n <p>This is a sturdy workhorse of a mixer. For every rotation around the bowl, the dough hook, wire whip, or beater has 59 touchpoints for more thorough mixing — perfect for ensuring even bakes. The motor is also strong enough to knead bread dough for several minutes. There is no overload protection, however, so be sure to knead on low speeds and give your mixer a break in between tests so as not to overwhelm the motor.&nbsp;</p>\n <p>The tilt-head is what sets it apart from other KitchenAid stand mixers. It's easy to flip up the head to add ingredients more evenly and lock in place to mix and blend, though you should be careful when doing either to avoid splashing yourself with a wet mixture or a poof of flour. Because the head will be out of the way, it's also more convenient to load and unload the mixing bowl underneath the attachment heads.&nbsp;</p>\n <p>However, the biggest issue is that the mixing bowl sometimes can initially leave a gray residue on the food you are preparing due to polishing material. KitchenAid recommends scrubbing your mixer bowl with baking soda or lemon and salt to remove any residue from the bowl before your first use.</p>\n <p><a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/6415797/type/dlg/https://www.kitchenaid.com/custom.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener nofollow sponsored\">KitchenAid</a> also has a tool that lets you customize the stand color, mixing bowl, and more for this particular model.

It comes with a 4.5-quart bowl, a coated dough hook, 10-speed settings powered by a 250-watt motor, a wire whip, and a coated flat beater. It works with more than a dozen optional attachments that can be used to make pasta, grind meat, and much more.</p>\n <p>The mixer has a relatively small motor so it's very quiet. You can control the speed using a shifting knob on the side of the unit. The K45SS does not have a slow-start mixing option, so if you're mixing dry ingredients such as flour, it could send ingredients flying. You can combat this with a <a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/6415797/type/dlg/https://www.kitchenaid.com/countertop-appliances/stand-mixers/accessories/p.1-piece-pouring-shield.kn1ps.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">pouring shield</a> or a strategically placed kitchen towel.</p>\n <p>Because the motor is smaller than other KitchenAids, it won't be able to handle tougher tasks like long kneading sessions or particularly thick mixtures without strain. Short bursts on low speed should be fine, but you'll have to be careful not to overload the motor.</p>\n <p>This model is also a bit smaller in stature, so it won't take up as much room on your counter as some of the larger models. If you have the spare cabinet space, you might even be able to store it away when not in use, but it's a pretty heavy machine to continually take out and put away.</p>\n <p>The included bowl does not have a handle. It may not be an issue for the smaller bowl size but you can pick up a <a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/6415797/type/dlg/https://www.kitchenaid.com/countertop-appliances/stand-mixers/attachments/p.4.5-qt-4.28-l-brushed-stainless-steel-bowl.k45sbwh.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\">replacement bowl with a handle</a>&nbsp;if that bothers you.</p>\n <p><strong>Pros: </strong>Affordable, 10 different speed settings, tilt-up mixer head</p>\n <p><strong>Cons: </strong>Usable but not very powerful motor, no slow-start mixing option, mixing bowl doesn't have a handle</p> The best for bread \n <figure> \n  <img src=\"https://i.insider.com/59a7150e6eac401c008b6d41?format=jpeg\" alt=\"kitchen aid pro\" height=\"1492\" width=\"1989\" charset=\"\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <p class=\"copyright\">KitchenAid</p> \n   </figcaption> </img>\n </figure> \n <h3>With a 450-watt motor, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004LS8HNO/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=biipgf_090617_best-stand-mixers-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B004LS8HNO&amp;linkId=52929af098ce73e83f4a5c1afcd3c45e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow nofollow sponsored\">KitchenAid Professional 5 Plus Series Stand Mixer</a> is one of KitchenAid's most powerful mixers. The slow-start function makes it particularly well-suited for making bread.</h3>\n <p>For the past 15 years, I have owned and regularly used the forebear of the Professional 5 Plus: the Professional 5. The Plus improves upon my model with a stronger motor (450 watts verses 350 watts), overload protection, and slow start. It packs a lot of power while taking up relatively little counter space, and at 16.5 inches tall, it fits under most cabinets.</p>\n <p>I bake two loaves of bread per week with my mixer and it has never had a problem kneading the dough. My model has also done a fabulous job mixing ingredients and batter for cookies, cake, pie, and everything else we ask of it, so it's safe to assume the Plus can do an even better job.&nbsp;</p>\n <p>The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004LS8HNO/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=biipgf_090617_best-stand-mixers-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B004LS8HNO&amp;linkId=52929af098ce73e83f4a5c1afcd3c45e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow nofollow sponsored\">KitchenAid Professional 5 Plus</a> has a 10-speed motor with a slow-start function and overload protection. It comes with a 5-quart stainless steel mixing bowl featuring an ergonomic handle. Also, the hinged hub cover flips up to make it easier to install attachments, including the spiral dough hook, wire whip, and flat beater that it comes with. The bowl is lifted to the mixer using a simple lever that securely stays in place.</p>\n <p>The overload reset, which automatically shuts off your mixer should it begin to overheat, sets this model apart from other KitchenAid products. A slow start-up keeps your ingredients from flying everywhere too. The powerful motor, however, does make more noise than the other picks on our list.&nbsp;</p>\n <p>Due to a unique design in which the beater spins clockwise as the shaft and bowl spin counter-clockwise, there are 67 touchpoints for even mixing.&nbsp;</p>\n <p><strong>Pros: </strong>Advanced features, ergonomic design, 67-point mixing, powerful motor</p>\n <p><strong>Cons: </strong>Heavy, loud</p> What else we considered \n <figure> \n  <img src=\"https://i.insider.com/59a716b66eac401c008b6d69?format=jpeg\" alt=\"kitchenaid artisan\" height=\"1489\" width=\"1985\" charset=\"\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <p class=\"copyright\">KitchenAid</p> \n   </figcaption> </img>\n </figure> \n <ul>\n  <li><a href=\"http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/6415797/type/dlg/sid/biipgf_090117_best-kitchenaid-mixers/https://www.kitchenaid.com/countertop-appliances/stand-mixers/tilt-head-stand-mixers/p.artisan-design-series-5-quart-tilt-head-stand-mixer-with-glass-bowl.ksm155gbca.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">KitchenAid Artisan Design Series with Glass Bowl</a>: This was previously our splurge pick, but the glass bowl is less durable than the usual stainless steel bowl.

At nearly 30 pounds, this isn't a machine you're going to be picking up and moving around often, but if that sounds like you, be sure that you have the counter space.&nbsp;</p></li>\n </ul>\n <p>&nbsp;</p> What to look for in a KitchenAid stand mixer \n <p>KitchenAid stand mixers are the standard in the industry for their versatility — they can mix, blend, knead, and more for many baking and cooking needs.&nbsp; Here are some things to consider when you're ready to ramp up your culinary experience.&nbsp;</p>\n <h3>Tilt-head versus bowl-lift</h3>\n <p>KitchenAid mixers come with either a tilt-head or a lever that lifts your bowl up to the mixing attachment. They're both great but the lift models tend to be taller and wider, therefore they require more counter space. They are generally more sturdy than the tilt-head units, which can bounce when handling larger batches of dough, not it's not a major issue.</p>\n <h3>Accessories and attachments</h3>\n <p>Most KitchenAids already come with a handful of useful attachments but there's an <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-kitchenaid-attachment\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">array of optional attachments and accessories</a> available. Many attachments work across all models.

All of these efforts position you as an <a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/230259\">authority</a> in your industry, demonstrate your expertise in your topic over the long run and cultivate trust in your audience by putting their needs and interests first.</p><h3><strong>How to tell if you're doing it right</strong></h3><p>You're doing content marketing (and not just content creation or digital marketing) if your content:</p><ul><li><strong>Puts your audience first</strong>. Be customer-focused, not company-focused. You're delivering helpful, valuable content and letting the customer decide when they trust you enough to buy from you.</li><li><strong>Links back to a business goal or solution to a problem</strong>. You've laid out how your content works together to further your business goals.</li><li><strong>Rarely, if ever, actively promotes your brand outright</strong>. CTAs are great, but you aren't trying to push your readers to your solutions.</li><li><strong>Attracts readers to your turf</strong>. You're building authority by providing readers with a destination to which they can keep returning.</li><li><strong>Gets published consistently and continuously</strong>. You're building trust by proving you're an expert in the matter over time rather than publishing one-offs.</li><li><strong>Uses metrics to measure and optimize</strong>. You can identify what's performing well, and where you need to improve based on data.</li></ul><h3>To master content marketing, you must master these 11 content types.</h3><p>High-performing content is central to your content marketing, but the way you craft it can make or break your strategy. It's not enough to simply create eBooks, blogs&#160;and catchy social media that provide helpful information &#8230; that's still biased toward your brand.</p><p>People are catching on to even that now.</p><p>Yet, with all the content creation that you will still do, it can be easy to lose your focus. Here's an overview of how to use the eleven main types of content in content marketing:</p><ol><li><strong>Blogs</strong>. Make sure they're optimized for SEO because they're one of the best ways to boost your page ranks. <a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/269879\">Include a CTA</a> and consider opening up comments for further engagement.</li><li><strong>Case studies</strong>. Illustrate your expertise by taking your readers on a journey that showcases solutions to their pain points.</li><li><strong>eBooks</strong>. They make great lead magnets, especially when you craft a magnetizing title and supply information people can't find elsewhere.</li><li><strong>Emails</strong>. Write direct, powerful, concise copy that contains information that can change your readers' lives. They're a direct line to your audience and can build long-lasting relationships when done well.</li><li><strong>Headlines</strong>. Powerful, compelling headlines <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52cVkaZYP3A\">(that don't sound spammy</a>!) let your readers know exactly what they're getting. They're also a great way to convey brand with language.</li><li><strong>Meta titles and descriptions</strong>. Put yourself in your readers' shoes and let them know you have the answers they're searching for right now.</li><li><strong>Product descriptions</strong>. Optimize with keywords and describe products in terms of benefits rather than features.</li><li><strong>Social media posts</strong>. Create an experience that puts them at the center and encourages engagement. This helps your audience connect with your brand emotionally and can help you find their pain points.</li><li><strong>Video scripts</strong>. Tell your brand's story engagingly. You can also include the script text on the page to make your content more accessible, and boost SEO.</li><li><strong>Web content</strong>. Make important or helpful information prominent, include a clear CTA, and use high-quality images to craft a powerful message.</li><li><strong>White papers</strong>.&#160;Explore relevant topics in-depth and give your target audience ideas that they can apply to their own problems or daily life.</li></ol><h3>Content making content marketing work: an example</h3><p>By now, I hope I've demonstrated how content creation is intrinsic to content marketing. However, just because you're creating content, it doesn't mean you're doing content marketing.</p><p>I want to drive things home with an example.</p><p>Let's say that we're growing an athletic clothing brand and looking for ways to attract more customers to our e-commerce site. We've decided to turn to content marketing for help. It might look like this:</p><p><strong>1. You want to increase your brand's presence on Google and social media, but you don't want to constantly annoy your readers with ads. How else can you get your brand in front of your readers?</strong></p><p>You decide that the best way forward is to start a blog full of topics that interest your readers. A few things that come to mind include clean eating, exercising at home, and personal empowerment. You can also talk about clothes, of course,&#160;but your models can all wear your brand, which eliminates the need for more direct advertising.</p><p><strong>2. You start your blog, set up your social media&#160;and let your following know about it.</strong></p><p>Engagement metrics indicate that readers are most excited about exercising at home. Looking through their comments, you notice that things like staying focused, finding the right space, and keeping a schedule are all major pain points that they have.</p><p><strong>3. You respond by creating an online guide to exercising at home.</strong></p><p>You use a combination of eBooks chock-full of challenges that are available as lead magnets, and video&#160;tutorials for exercises hosted on your site. To demonstrate how popular your guides are, you create a way for users to record their progress and encourage each other.</p><p><strong>4. To maintain engagement, you start up an email newsletter with the latest challenges, shoutouts for people who have achieved their goals&#160;and occasionally a promo here or there.</strong></p><p>Throughout this, you continue to grow your online community, adding more content to your blog that addresses questions or pain points. You even start a hashtag that your followers can use to highlight their fitness efforts so that they can spread the word about you.</p><p><strong>5. At some point, you realize that you can enrich your readers' experience with case studies and white papers.</strong></p><p>You begin to include \"white papers\"&#160;about health and fitness that are relevant to your target audience. You also start to create case studies of \"success stories\" from your community.</p><p><strong>6. As fitness centers start to notice what you're doing, you start getting offers for sponsored classes&#160;and requests to sell your brand in their shops.</strong></p><p>Your content marketing is now extending your brand's reach into the offline world. You'll continue all of the efforts above, as the results are feeding further content production.</p><p>Can you spot all eleven content types above? Look carefully. They're here.</p><p>(Bonus: Do you know what brand I just described? Spoiler: This is Athleta's content marketing strategy. Check it out at&#160;https://events.athleta.com/)</p><h3>Now you know the difference between content and content marketing in 2020.</h3><p>The main difference between content versus content marketing? Content marketing involves a lot more than just content creation. In fact, the emphasis isn't content creation at all, but crafting an experience that improves the lives of your readers. If you're putting your readers first, addressing pain points&#160;and producing exceptional quality content consistently, then you'll grow your brand while you cultivate authority and trust. That's content marketing.</p><p>Hopefully, I've left you with an idea or two about your content marketing strategy. Now, go forth and convert that target audience into passionate fans.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/6-keys-effective-content-marketing-strategy-2020-8'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=eUNegOW8do0:JjUFK5GO3gY:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=eUNegOW8do0:JjUFK5GO3gY:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=eUNegOW8do0:JjUFK5GO3gY:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=eUNegOW8do0:JjUFK5GO3gY:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=eUNegOW8do0:JjUFK5GO3gY:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=eUNegOW8do0:JjUFK5GO3gY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=eUNegOW8do0:JjUFK5GO3gY:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=eUNegOW8do0:JjUFK5GO3gY:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/eUNegOW8do0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 31 Aug 2020 13:02:00 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5ed56a9d2618b930c97418f4?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"f2931cd2f248ceea41604a81c05afa39","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn67@2020_5/2020/08/31/17-21-55-742_108927038b02f2c6.webp","destWidth":1421,"destHeight":1065,"sourceBytes":70012,"destBytes":70012,"author":"insider@insider.com (Julia McCoy)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5f46ac8442f43f001ddff384?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn92@2020_1/2020/08/31/17-22-08-050_11d921fce74c6c18.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn51@2020_3/2020/08/31/17-22-14-421_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=eUNegOW8do0:JjUFK5GO3gY:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn23@2020_5/2020/08/31/17-22-10-898_1aaf7de7fcb4d9df.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=eUNegOW8do0:JjUFK5GO3gY:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn91@2020_2/2020/08/31/17-22-15-035_93b763f61bb9d53d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn76@2020_1/2020/08/31/17-22-07-798_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=eUNegOW8do0:JjUFK5GO3gY:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn35@2020_6/2020/08/31/17-22-11-428_37deecff7866d5e6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/eUNegOW8do0":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn3@2020_1/2020/08/31/17-22-00-792_e8f88ec1afd621a8.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598894512918},{"createdTime":"2020-09-01 01:21:52","updatedTime":"2020-09-01 01:21:52","title":"How to get rid of your firm's workaholic culture in 3 steps","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/get-rid-of-your-firms-workaholic-culture-in-3-steps-2020-8","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f46c690cd2fec00296a4616?format=jpeg\" alt=\"employees office\" height=\"1000\" width=\"2000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Yes, you should turn off your work notifications.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Moyo Studio/Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\"><li>With the new WFH world, it can be tempting to WFH 24/7 &#8212;

Many entrepreneurs might erroneously believe that sending emails at all hours of the day isn't problematic since their employees are now working from home. But what they're actually doing is promoting an unhealthy, \"always-on\" company culture that keeps people chained to their devices.</p><p>Writing for <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2020/06/how-different-personality-types-cope-with-an-always-on-culture\">Harvard Business Review</a>, John Hackston explains that, \"Technology can empower people, but it can also make them feel <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1201/1078.10580530/45520.22.4.20050901/90026.2?journalCode=uism20\">enslaved</a>. By thinking carefully about how and when to use it, you can find your own sweet spot. Amid the current crisis, that's more important than ever.\"</p><h2>\"Always-on\" has become the default</h2><p>Let me pose this question: How often do you take your smartphone with you to lunch or dinner? How about to bed? If you take a moment to tally up the number of times you've received work notifications outside of <a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/topic/work-hours\">work hours</a>, you'd likely lose count.&#160;</p><p>When I tell you that, as entrepreneurs, we are \"always-on,\" I am referring to this habit of not distinguishing between work and personal time. Many of us may have inadvertently set our company culture to reflect our own lax boundaries around technology.&#160;</p><p>I know that when I first founded <a href=\"https://www.jotform.com/\">my startup</a>, I had this misplaced belief that answering emails till midnight or during weekends made me more productive. I had yet to establish the firm work policies I now have in place.&#160;</p><p>Research <a href=\"https://www.isonderhouden.nl/doc/pdf/arnoldbakker/articles/articles_arnold_bakker_379.pdf\">shows</a> that as supervisors, we need to be careful in creating harmful expectations when it comes to smartphone use.&#160;</p><p>As Hackston points out:&#160;\"And now that so many of us are working from home, communicating with our colleagues exclusively via electronic media, the boundaries between home and work can become increasingly blurred, making it even more difficult to switch off.\"</p><p>Many of us might figure that since we're working from home, we'll get all our emails done later in the night or on Sunday morning. But what we often don't take into consideration, is that we're significantly contributing to employee distress, and, ultimately, an unhealthy environment.</p><h2>The change starts at the level of leadership</h2><p>As leaders, it's up to us to set a calm and productive culture that wards off <a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/topic/burnout\">burnout</a>.&#160;</p><p>The problem with blurring the border between work and downtime is that it leaks into other areas of your life like your health, family and personal time.&#160;</p><p>One 2012 <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0268401212000606\">study</a> found the more information overload we experience, our productivity and performance decreases. And not only that, our decision-making and ability to innovate also become compromised. Other <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2009/08/21/0903620106.abstract\">research</a> shows that heavy multitaskers are less capable of doing several things at once compared to light multitaskers.</p><p>In other words, constant interruptions and not giving your team the head-space to be fully present in their personal lives will eventually lead to poor work results.&#160;</p><p>So, what's to be done?</p><p>To paraphrase Branson's insight, the key is to treat your team how you would like to be treated. Below I offer an alternative path for cultivating more balance.</p><h2>Ways to dismantle workaholic culture</h2><p>1. Set the pace. It's important that we note how our everyday habits perpetuate larger work behaviors. Meaning, we are setting the precedent for how employees feel they should act. For example, if I answer phone calls while I'm having dinner with family, I'm creating an expectation that it's fine to blur these lines between our work and home life. If we don't create boundaries around our own work hours, others won't think they have the right to not immediately answer calls.</p><p>2. Allow your team to switch off. During the first five years of JotForm, we had just four employees. It was relatively easy to keep track of communication. But as we grew, I decided that promoting a healthy company culture meant adjusting our policies to reflect our values. Instead of simply paying lip-service to these ideals, I make it a point to walk my talk, and I do this in several ways:&#160;</p><ul><li>By encouraging my team to delete their Slack app on weekends, the amount of work related correspondence during our employee's downtime is limited.&#160;</li><li>By defining the parameters of \"on\" and \"off\" hours, team members who are eager to please will assume they should always \"be on\" unless you tell them otherwise. Communicating clear expectations helps them guard their time better.</li><li>By not stressing them out with excessive emails, I respect their personal time. <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90510021/managers-think-twice-before-you-send-that-2-a-m-email\">I've written before</a> why we should refrain from sending 2 a.m. emails. Keep in mind, receiving that ping in the dead of night is disrupting their sleep and causing unneeded stress during a time that's already stressful enough. In making sure I schedule my send time for business hours, I'm letting them know I respect their health and wellbeing.</li></ul><p>3. Create a culture of honesty.&#160;Finally, breaking a work addiction mindset involves transparency on what we all can and can't do. Creating a sense of community and collaboration comes from allowing team members to examine their capacity to give.&#160;</p><p>Ask the hard questions like: Are they working through personal things at home? This is especially relevant now when people are dealing with mental health and safety concerns.&#160;</p><p>Having an open conversation about availability is what forms a healthy <a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/topic/work-culture\">work culture</a>. Instead of slowly watching employees burnout, talk with them and really listen to their needs. In doing so, you're improving your company's overall health, creativity, and performance. As Branson wisely <a href=\"https://www.virgin.com/disruptors/what-employee-wellbeing-means-me-richard-branson\">emphasizes</a>, you'll establish an environment in which everyone can flourish.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/get-rid-of-your-firms-workaholic-culture-in-3-steps-2020-8'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=aOcimV18Kuo:JZCr1Ug7Zh0:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=aOcimV18Kuo:JZCr1Ug7Zh0:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=aOcimV18Kuo:JZCr1Ug7Zh0:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=aOcimV18Kuo:JZCr1Ug7Zh0:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=aOcimV18Kuo:JZCr1Ug7Zh0:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=aOcimV18Kuo:JZCr1Ug7Zh0:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=aOcimV18Kuo:JZCr1Ug7Zh0:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=aOcimV18Kuo:JZCr1Ug7Zh0:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/aOcimV18Kuo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 31 Aug 2020 13:07:00 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5f46c639cd2fec00296a460f?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"4b97f714bd42f3c9f509200da0736e41","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn87@2020_4/2020/08/31/17-21-55-853_b447aec013d19eca.webp","destWidth":1777,"destHeight":1333,"sourceBytes":168028,"destBytes":168028,"author":"insider@insider.com (Aytekin Tank)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5f46c690cd2fec00296a4616?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn95@2020_1/2020/08/31/17-22-06-231_407e70aca338f4fc.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn51@2020_3/2020/08/31/17-22-14-421_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=aOcimV18Kuo:JZCr1Ug7Zh0:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn55@2020_1/2020/08/31/17-21-57-593_88c8d6d99e2a51d0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=aOcimV18Kuo:JZCr1Ug7Zh0:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn87@2020_3/2020/08/31/17-22-13-477_c81e6f8dd26596e6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn76@2020_1/2020/08/31/17-22-07-798_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=aOcimV18Kuo:JZCr1Ug7Zh0:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn11@2020_6/2020/08/31/17-22-21-570_65ed297b02d973b3.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/aOcimV18Kuo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn59@2020_4/2020/08/31/17-22-08-813_f6e159d31290971c.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598894512878},{"createdTime":"2020-09-01 01:21:52","updatedTime":"2020-09-01 01:21:52","title":"What living on Earth would be like without the moon","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-life-earth-would-change-without-moon-disappeared-2018-3","description":"<div style=\"position:relative; overflow:hidden; padding-bottom:56.25%\">\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/players/u14hK9KI-jZbcmOYf.html\"\nwidth=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"auto\" title=\"What living on Earth would be like without the moon\"\nstyle=\"position:absolute;\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div><ul class=\"summary-list\"><li>Each year, the moon drifts an estimated 1.5 inches further away from Earth.&#160;</li><li>The moon has the largest influence on Earth's tides and without it, high and low tides would shrink by an estimated 75%.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories</a>.</li></ul><p><em>Following is a transcript of the video.</em></p><p><strong>Narrator: </strong>Our <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/20-facts-about-the-moon-2012-12\">moon</a> is on the move.

To start, between the sun, Earth's rotation, and the moon, the moon has the largest influence on Earth's <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-ocean-tides-work-lunar-gravity-2017-6\">tides</a>.</p><p>Without it, high and low tides would shrink by an estimated 75%. This would jeopardize the lives of many types of crabs, mussels, and sea snails that live in tidal zones and disrupt the diets of larger animals who rely on them for food, threatening entire coastal ecosystems in the process. Within a few decades, we would start to see mass population declines in the sea and on land.</p><p>One of the largest spawning events in the world occurs in the <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/great-barrier-reef-turning-white-2016-3\">Great Barrier Reef</a>. Each November in the days following the light of a full moon, coral colonies across the reef &#8212; spanning an area larger than the state of New Mexico &#8212; release millions of egg and sperm sacs within nearly minutes of one another. Scientists are certain that the full moon plays a role in the timing, but exactly how remains a mystery.</p><p>On land, animals like these <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/crabs-migrate-christmas-island-2018-1\">Red Crabs</a> also use lunar cues to reproduce. After living most of their lives in the mountains, millions of adult crabs migrate down to shore. And then, only during the last quarter of the moon, females release their eggs into the sea.</p><p>Now, the moon may not hold as much sway over human reproduction. But without it, something else we care equally about would change &#8212; the weather. Tides and tidal currents help mix cold arctic waters with warmer waters in the tropics. This balances temperatures and stabilizes the climate worldwide. Without the moon, weather forecasts would be practically impossible. The average difference between the hottest and coldest places on Earth could grow to life-threatening extremes.</p><p>But none of this compares to the biggest change that we would have coming over the next millennia. Right now, Earth tilts on its axis at 23.5&#186; mostly due to the moon's gravity. If the moon disappeared, Earth's axis would wobble between anywhere from 10 to 45&#186;.</p><p>Some experts estimate that Jupiter could help keep Earth's tilt from reeling completely out of control. But even just an extra 10&#186; tilt could wreak havoc on the climate and seasons.<br >In the past, Earth's tilt has changed by about 1-2&#186;, which scientists think could have caused <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/cosmos-explanation-of-earths-ice-ages-2014-5\">Ice Ages</a> in the past. It's hard to know what a 10&#186; or 45&#186; tilt would do but probably nothing good for most life on Earth.</p><p>The moon isn't just imperative for life on Earth today. Experts believe that it may also have played a key role in the formation of life more than 3.5 billion years ago. Turns out, the moon isn't just a beacon of light in the night sky. Its existence is crucial to the delicate balancing act that makes life here possible.</p><p><em>Video courtesy of <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/norazian/\" target=\"_blank\"

The margin of error was, for most of the survey questions, less than 2%.</p><p>For comparison, a 2016 Military Times poll of US service members showed that 40.5% said they would vote for Trump. Only 20.6% of respondents reported they would vote for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.</p><p>Trump has repeatedly referred to the armed forces as \"my military\" while referring to top officers as \"my generals,\" and he often boasts about all that he has done for the military, including soaring spending increases aimed at rebuilding a force ground down by the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p><p>Still, the view of the president among active-duty US troops is increasingly unfavorable, <a href=\"https://www.militarytimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2020/08/31/as-trumps-popularity-slips-in-latest-military-times-poll-more-troops-say-theyll-vote-for-biden/\">found the Military Times poll released Monday.</a>.</p><p>Over the past four years, favorable views of Trump among US service members have dropped significantly from 46.1% in 2016 to 37.8% in the most recent survey, with unfavorable views of the president surging from 37% to 49.9%.</p><p>Many who were surveyed disagreed with some of the president's actions and policies.</p><p>For example, while more than half of respondents supported calling in the National Guard to address civil unrest, 74% of the US service members that responded to the poll said that they opposed Trump's proposals to use active-duty US military to quell unrest in American cities, something Trump's own secretary of defense pushed back against.</p><p>In June, a number of <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/former-military-leaders-slam-trumps-handling-of-protests-2020-6\">former top US military leaders sharply criticized Trump's militarized handling of the protests</a> in response to concerns about police brutality and racial injustice following the death of George Floyd. The latest Military Times survey revealed more unfavorable views of Trump among officers than enlisted.</p><p>Looking at other important issues, <a href=\"https://www.militarytimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2020/08/31/as-trumps-popularity-slips-in-latest-military-times-poll-more-troops-say-theyll-vote-for-biden/\">the Military Times poll</a> found that only 17% of those surveyed felt the Trump administration properly addressed reports suggesting that Russia had paid militants in Afghanistan bounties for targeting US troops, and more than half felt that troop levels in Germany, which the White House moved to cut, should be kept at the same level or increased.</p><p>Commenting on the survey results, Peter Feaver, a Duke University political science professor and a former White House adviser to President George W. Bush, <a href=\"https://www.militarytimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2020/08/31/as-trumps-popularity-slips-in-latest-military-times-poll-more-troops-say-theyll-vote-for-biden/\">told Military Times</a> that the recent poll results \"do not necessarily show that troops are beginning to think more like Democrats, but instead that they aren't thinking like Trump Republicans.\"</p><p>\"The bottom line,\" he said, \"is that in 2020, Trump can't be claiming to have overwhelming support in the military.\"</p><p>Polls like the recent Military Times survey are representative of ony one moment in time and not necessarily the entire force. Views of the candidates within the military have the potential to change between now and the election.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/poll-more-us-troops-say-they-prefer-biden-to-trump-2020-8'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=7UPIoPI1OR8:RDV0A8PY4tg:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=7UPIoPI1OR8:RDV0A8PY4tg:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=7UPIoPI1OR8:RDV0A8PY4tg:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=7UPIoPI1OR8:RDV0A8PY4tg:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=7UPIoPI1OR8:RDV0A8PY4tg:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=7UPIoPI1OR8:RDV0A8PY4tg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=7UPIoPI1OR8:RDV0A8PY4tg:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=7UPIoPI1OR8:RDV0A8PY4tg:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/7UPIoPI1OR8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 31 Aug 2020 16:41:48 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5f3bd297650894001d0720ce?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"779047254d05772f0577205243822ec2","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn100@2020_2/2020/08/31/17-21-56-068_270e070fc005a58e.webp","destWidth":3568,"destHeight":2676,"sourceBytes":1035302,"destBytes":1035302,"author":"rpickrell@businessinsider.com (Ryan Pickrell)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5f45ad4189aff80028ab7efd?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn52@2020_2/2020/08/31/17-22-07-574_b9acca90443886fb.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn51@2020_3/2020/08/31/17-22-14-421_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=7UPIoPI1OR8:RDV0A8PY4tg:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn72@2020_1/2020/08/31/17-22-20-042_b1586152a0dd9418.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=7UPIoPI1OR8:RDV0A8PY4tg:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn79@2020_4/2020/08/31/17-21-58-969_2ad05301f22d233f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn76@2020_1/2020/08/31/17-22-07-798_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=7UPIoPI1OR8:RDV0A8PY4tg:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn16@2020_6/2020/08/31/17-21-59-485_09fed905754f1092.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/7UPIoPI1OR8":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn100@2020_3/2020/08/31/17-22-10-721_973692354e8baf9f.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598894512846},{"createdTime":"2020-09-01 01:21:52","updatedTime":"2020-09-01 01:21:52","title":"Mastercard is pursuing touchless retail with two new AI-powered solutions","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/mastercard-unveils-two-touchless-payment-solutions-for-retailers-2020-8","description":"<ul class=\"summary-list\"><li>This story was delivered to Insider Intelligence Payments &#38;

In late 2019, the Kincade Fire destroyed over 100 buildings like the iconic Soda Rock Winery.</li><li>Even if the flames don't reach winemakers' property, \"smoke taint\" can ruin their crop with an ashy taste that is hard to remove.</li><li>And California's predominantly Latino agricultural workers are three times more likely than other workers to be infected by the coronavirus, according to a recent study.</li></ul><p>After four years of worsening fire conditions, California winemakers have been forced to make a difficult decision: salvage what they can before smoke ruins their grapes or lose the crops and hope insurance will cover the losses.</p><p>Since August 15, over <a href=\"https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/\">1.6 million acres</a> in California have burned &#8212; an area about the size of Delaware. <a href=\"https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2020/08/climate-change-is-worsening-californias-hellish-wildfires/\">Scientists predict</a> this year will likely mark the state's worst-ever wildfire season.</p><p>In a normal year, the end of summer would mark the beginning of harvest in wine country. Nearly 15 million tourists visit Sonoma and Napa counties annually &#8212; pumping about $4 billion into wineries, hotels, and restaurants, according to state tourism data.&#160;</p><p>\"Right now is the most critical time for the industry and our business and our county,\" Ross Reedy, the director of winemaking for Truett-Hurst Inc., said.</p><p>Reedy has worked in the wine industry for 12 years. He's seen how fires have changed the landscape over the years. He said that 10 years ago, he'd be able to determine when to pick grapes based on their ripeness, now he's at the mercy of fires and wind patterns.</p><p>Even when fires aren't close, winemakers worry about what they call \"smoke taint.\"</p><p>\"If you have smoke that sits in a vineyard over a period of time, it latches onto the skins and the sugar,\" Reedy said. \"It actually creates very heavy barbecue, ashtray kind of characteristics in the wine.\"</p><p>\"You can taste it as an ordinary consumer,\" Mia Van de Water, a master sommelier at Cote Korean Steakhouse in New York, said.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f4d0b0c7ffa48002894d1de?format=jpeg\" alt=\"wine fire\" height=\"1124\" width=\"2000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Austin Meyer for Business Insider Weekly</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>She said the ashy taste sometimes becomes apparent only after the grapes have been processed and fermented. Batches of affected wine are typically sold in bulk and blended in with other wine to dilute the flavor.</p><p>\"It'll wind up in something like Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi,\" she said, referring to a product that costs under $10 per bottle.</p><p>Some vineyards are just one lost crop away from their business coming to an end.</p><p>\"First of all, it hurts the grower,\" Reedy said. \"So basically he doesn't make any money this year. He limps along. If he was in dire straits, it could potentially kill his business.\"&#160;</p><p>Hotter, drier conditions are becoming part of a \"new normal\" in California. Though <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/california-kincade-fire-sonoma-county-2020-8\">last year's Kincade Fire started because of faulty electrical equipment</a>, this year's combination of a searing heat wave and rare summer lightning storms has kicked off what scientists predict could be a catastrophic fire season.&#160;</p><p>Winemakers are trying their best to adapt, but there are many complications.</p><p>The power at <a href=\"https://www.emmittscorsone.com/\">Emmitt-Scorsone Wines</a> was out for over a week.&#160;&#160;&#160;</p><p>Some vineyards have crop insurance, but it rarely covers all losses. That puts growers like Reedy in a bind: harvest what they can and risk that the wine made from them will have an unpleasant smoke flavor, or let them rot on the vine and file an insurance claim.</p><p>And it means asking field workers to brave rough conditions in the middle of a pandemic. <a href=\"https://www.cirsinc.org/\">A July study</a> showed that California agricultural workers were three times more likely to contract the virus compared with workers in other sectors.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.corazonhealdsburg.org/\">Coraz&#243;n Healdsburg</a>, a local nonprofit, has been distributing food since the pandemic began. On August 21, it offered free COVID-19 testing for the community in the parking lot adjacent to its headquarters. Many of those who show up for testing are agricultural workers and their families.</p><p>\"If somebody is infected with COVID, that could really have a huge impact on the whole operation. And so that's why this testing is so important right now,\" Ariel Kelley, the CEO of the organization, said.&#160;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f4d0b4d7ffa48002894d1df?format=jpeg\" alt=\"wine fire\" height=\"1122\" width=\"2000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Austin Meyer for Business Insider Weekly</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>A majority of agriculture workers in Sonoma County are Spanish speakers. That language barrier can make it difficult to pass on information about COVID-19 and fire evacuations. Some of those who need help most are afraid to ask because of their immigration status, Kelley said.</p><p>\"There will be folks by virtue of all of the alphabet soup of government agencies that show up: the California Office of Emergency Services and all of the different government departments that come. People get nervous and rightfully so,\" Kelley said.</p><p>Despite these challenges, winemakers are taking steps to protect their workers and their grapes. Organizations like <a href=\"https://sonomawinegrape.org/\">Sonoma County Winegrowers</a> provide fire-safety training. Others have produced instructional videos about COVID-19 for Spanish-speaking workers.</p><p>In St. Helena, California, <a href=\"https://www.etslabs.com/home\">ETS Laboratories</a> developed a test to detect smoke taint in grapes. This year they've already received 1,000 samples for testing, according to Karissa Kruse, the president of Sonoma County Winegrowers. Kruse also oversees <a href=\"https://www.scggf.org/\">a foundation</a> that provides emergency relief to agricultural workers affected by fires.</p><p>But many growers, like Palmer Emmitt of Emmitt-Scorsone Wines, remain optimistic about the industry's future.</p><p>\"Hopefully this is not going to be an annual occurrence. But Sonoma County and the wine industry are resilient, and I think we'll survive and keep chugging,\" Emmitt said.</p><p>In the wee hours of August 23, Reedy's crew finished their emergency pick. It seems that the day's haul has a future in bottles as ros&#233;.</p><p>\"We would have loved to have turned this into a still red wine, but you gotta do what you gotta do,\" Reedy said.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/california-fires-wine-country-grapes-coronavirus-2020-8'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=V2RvLJXuN7Y:Bh7pQEoFSX4:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=V2RvLJXuN7Y:Bh7pQEoFSX4:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=V2RvLJXuN7Y:Bh7pQEoFSX4:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=V2RvLJXuN7Y:Bh7pQEoFSX4:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=V2RvLJXuN7Y:Bh7pQEoFSX4:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=V2RvLJXuN7Y:Bh7pQEoFSX4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=V2RvLJXuN7Y:Bh7pQEoFSX4:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=V2RvLJXuN7Y:Bh7pQEoFSX4:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/V2RvLJXuN7Y\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 31 Aug 2020 15:00:00 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5f4d089b7ffa48002894d1d3?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"b0229d5cfc4e00af0efebf22ea0d35da","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn45@2020_3/2020/08/31/17-22-26-472_1d233e6bf9817841.webp","destWidth":1500,"destHeight":1125,"sourceBytes":102430,"destBytes":102430,"author":"insider@insider.com (Austin Meyer,Daniel T.

Not only is it dead-simple to set up with your phone, but Nest Wifi includes convenient smart home features.</p><p>The add-on units for the mesh system include microphones and speakers and act as their own Google Assistant speakers. You can ask for the weather, to play music, or even get help with your wireless system. For example, you can perform an internet speed test just by asking, without even having to open your app.</p><p>Google recently integrated the Wifi system into its Home app so, in the same way you'd set up a new Home Hub or other assistant, everything is now in one app. This is mostly a good move. The down side however is that there are a lot of settings and options lurking around every corner. Newcomers should not be afraid, but just aware that learning the app's navigation could take a little time to become completely familiar.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Integrated into Google Home app, easy as setting up a Google Assistant</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Not fully merged with Google Wifi app yet</p>\n\tThe easiest mesh system for add-on features\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f49287edb1ed0002971482c?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Linksys Velop\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Amazon</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<h3>Linksys, now owned by Belkin, has the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N2NLNEH/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipgf_082820_easy-wi-fi-mesh-systems-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B01N2NLNEH&#38;linkId=5815b43868ad0772559df9dc8319da1c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Linksys Velop</a> mesh networking system which contains one of the easiest setup processes from this bunch.</h3><p>It too is done completely from a mobile app and doesn't even come with any instructions in the box because of its simplicity. There are several models of Linksys' Velop mesh system, but the difference is really in the hardware capability, such as range and specifications. The app and software is largely the same no matter which one you get. We recently reviewed the AC220 system and it was a piece of cake to get going for the first time.</p><p>The longest part of the process is waiting five-to-six minutes for it to find new units and automatically configure them with your existing settings. The only thing you're doing during that time is waiting, so it's not hard.</p><p>Not only are Velop mesh systems easy to set up, but they also include a few add-on features for added value. You can add on more advanced parental controls to more finely target what your kids' device can and can't access. You can also pay an additional yearly fee to turn your mesh system into a home motion detector. It works simply through sonar, by detecting differences in the wireless radio waves throughout your home, and then can alert you remotely when there is motion inside your home.</p><p>The nice thing about the motion feature is that it acts in a sophisticated manner for security purposes, but doesn't require any more hardware or even any more technical skills to get it going. It's all confined and accessible with the mesh system and app.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Fun and useful add-on features, variety of Velop systems to choose from</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Add-on advanced features aren't free</p>\n\tThe easiest mesh system for parental controls\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f49295adb1ed00029714831?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Netgear Orbi\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Amazon</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<h3><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01K4CZOBS/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipgf_082820_easy-wi-fi-mesh-systems-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B01K4CZOBS&#38;linkId=5238714ff65bad7565e5a0f31f48de1e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Netgear's Orbi</a> mesh system is largely lauded for its backhaul channels resulting in premium speeds while streaming lots of data &#8212; but it's also full of peace of mind with its parental controls.</h3><p>If you do choose an Orbi mesh system, you'll be pleasantly thrilled with its technical feats, but first and foremost, you should be very happy with its setup and ease of use.</p><p>The Orbi app is really paired down on first glance which makes it very simple for the casual interactions and getting started. Like other systems in this guide, Orbi uses a mobile app on your phone or tablet to connect and input the few needed settings like network name and password.</p><p>It also includes features like speed testing right up front inside the app as it prioritizes key interactions. Beyond the basics however, Netgear partnered with Disney's Circle for advanced and very easy-to-use parental controls.</p><p>Circle knows about the latest apps which you might want to limit and offers a way to give time limits and restrictions for different devices. Kids of different ages will need to be treated differently so that consideration is also built into the Circle settings.</p><p>For select Orbi systems you're also able to control settings via your voice. Some have Google Assistant built-in and so you can just ask it to pause your Wi-Fi or enable a guest network if you need to.</p><p><strong>Pros</strong>: Simple interface, advanced parental controls by Circle</p><p><strong>Cons</strong>: Orbi systems are usually priced high</p>\n\tThe easiest mesh system for early adopters\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f492f0560bf1f0028079319?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Nighthawk wifi 6\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Amazon</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<h3><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0823JXXX4/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipgf_082820_easy-wi-fi-mesh-systems-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B0823JXXX4&#38;linkId=d3c0057a75afaf2872735fc233d8ab0a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Neatgear's Nighthawk</a> line of routers originated out of its more advanced networking solutions and now includes a mesh option.</h3><p>Small, pointy black boxes give the Nighthawk mesh system a sleek and modern look, though may be more obvious around a home than other routers. Still, the Nighthawk mesh system with WiFi 6 is definitely for the early adopters, who still want an easy way to manage and set up their wireless routers. WiFi 6 is a rebranding of wireless protocols for the latest generation of specs. It includes four times more connections and has other improvements as gaming and streaming video take over everyone's wireless usage.</p><p>The Nighthawk mesh system includes a similar app experience to Netgear's Orbi. Both come from the same company so there's a good bit of overlap which makes it nice if you decide to upgrade from one to the other at some point.</p><p>Like the rest of these picks, the Nighthawk mobile app offers a simple and cohesive way to get your wireless system going. The setup process requires inputting only a minimal amount of data, such as giving your network a distinct name and password before you're up and going.</p><p>The app also allows access to prioritize devices on your network if you have an important video call you want to make sure gets all the data it needs.

Little did she know, picnics like this would become<strong>&#160;</strong>a socially distanced solution to her future quarantine boredom.</p><p>The scene, set up by LA-based picnic rental company <a href=\"https://thepicniccollective.com/\">The Picnic Collective</a>, was replete with a teepee, a table brimming with macaroons and flowers, and tasseled pillows. Jason Mraz's \"I Won't Give Up\" served as the soundtrack and there was, of course, a hidden photographer to capture it all.&#160;</p><p>\"It was the most amazing proposal ever,\" Schwalbach, 29, told Business Insider.</p><p>Schwalbach would go on to enlist The Picnic Collective's help twice in the next year as the coronavirus pandemic swept the US. In March, she ordered a picnic basket filled with cheese, fruit, and flowers for an at-home date night. In July, she worked with The Picnic Collective to set up a beach-themed surprise picnic for her friend's 30th birthday.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f490251cd2fec00296a4bb5?format=jpeg\" alt=\"rio schwalbach\" height=\"819\" width=\"1093\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The 30th birthday surprise picnic Rio Schwalbach set up for her friend.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Rio Schwalbach</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>As young adults like Schwalbach seek to keep special occasions special or look for new activities to do with friends during the pandemic, they're turning to the relatively new business of picnic rentals. Business Insider spoke with three picnic rental founders who all said their clientele consists primarily of 20- to 30-something females looking for new ways to celebrate major life milestones: marriages, birthdays, baby showers, gender reveals, proposals, and bachelorette parties.</p><h2>Picnics are prime for Instagram</h2><p>Lauren Rivard, a 26-year-old former marketing director, told Business Insider she started the The Picnic Collective in 2018 after noticing a gap in the market for outdoor gatherings. She now has 10 full-time employees.</p><p>\"To do something like this, you would have to hire an event planner and get rentals or coordinate florals or find a caterer,\" she said. \"So I just wanted to make it a one-stop-shop situation.\"</p><p>Newport and Malibu locations are some of the company's most popular picnic destinations, she said. It has set up picnics on the beaches of San Diego, Orange County, and Los Angeles and in the deserts and parks of Las Vegas. Rivard said that in the past month, they set up 200 picnics, averaging around 40 a week.</p><p>The Picnic Collective has two main packages, Rivard said, both of which are designed for two people: the Simple Pleasures package, which starts at $250, and the Bliss Package, which includes a farm table upgrade starting at $350. All picnics come with cheese boards and florals, plus set-up and clean-up. Picnickers looking to go ultra deluxe can also book a dessert station or yoga class for additional fees of up to $400. Rivard said it takes the team about 90 minutes to set up each picnic.</p><blockquote class=\"instagram-media\"   style=\"background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:540; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px); data.width~540;\">\n\t<div style=\"padding:8px;\">\n\t\t<div style=\"background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:62.4537037037% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;\">\n\t\t\t<div style=\"background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;\"></div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<p style=\"margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;\">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CC9MFQDnPW_\" style=\" color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;\" target=\"_blank\"></a></p> <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A post shared by Cassie Randolph (@cassierandolph)<time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2020-07-22T19:27:30+00:00\">Jul 22, 2020 at 12:27pm PDT</time>\n\t\t</p></div></blockquote><script async defer src=\"//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js\"></script><p>&#160;</p><p>The picnics' coastal or bohemian aeshetics are prime Instagram porn, and thus natural influencer fodder.

Picnic set-ups for 40-plus people in public places have given way to 10-person picnics at home.</p><p>Picnics here start at $169 for two guests; more people can be added for $20 a head. The company also offers various add-ons, the most popular of which, she said, are a teepee, wooden arch, and peacock chair.</p><p>Suarez founded Picnics in the City in March 2019 and drew inspiration from her time living in Paris. \"I would love picnicking by the Eiffel Tower and I wanted to bring a similar experience looking at the Houston skyline,\" she said.</p><p>That's exactly the experience Samantha Hentosh, 24, got when her fianc&#233; proposed in April. She told Business Insider the pandemic foiled his original plan to propose in Paris, so he turned to Picnics in the City instead.</p><p>Picnics in the City has been doing a contactless drop-off of picnic supplies rather than the standard set-up, so Hentosh's now-fianc&#233; set up a picnic in their favorite spot in Buffalo Bayou Park. The low picnic table was littered with photos of the two of them, a gauzy white runner, candlesticks, and orange flowers, all surrounded by cozy pillows.&#160;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f490367db1ed00029714732?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Allison Ermon Photography\" height=\"845\" width=\"1125\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Samantha Hentosh&#39;s proposal.\n<p class=\"copyright\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/allisonermon_photography/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">Allison Ermon Photography</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Meanwhile, others just want something fun to do.

The friend, Milano said, was looking for a safer alternative to eating inside restaurants.&#160;</p><p>Prices for Picnics in the Chi range from $199 for a basic set-up for two to $1,350 for a custom birthday celebration or gender reveal, founder Tunji Sanni told Business Insider. Milano's friend booked a luxury package for seven, which the group split at $88 per person; it&#160;included everything from a Bluetooth speaker and silk flowers to a cheese plate and cake.</p><p>\"I felt safe from a social disancing perspective, much more so than being on a restaurant patio,\" Milano said. \"It was a great way to catch up with friends and get some cute photos too.\"</p><p>Sanni said she created Picnics in the Chi in May to provide a fun, safe space for get-togethers that will relieve coronavirus-stress. She said she's seen a 47% increase in picnic rental requests from June to July.&#160;</p><p>\"Picnics are the new brunch,\" she said.&#160;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on

All of these products cost around $30 total.&#160;</li></ul><p>My friends and coworkers are always asking me where I get my nails done, and they're totally shocked when my response is that I do them at home. I prefer to have my nails painted at all times and I tend to put a fresh coat on every week (or every other week if I'm feeling lazy). I'm being totally honest when I say I only treat myself to a manicure and pedicure once a year for my birthday.</p><p>If I went to a nail salon on a weekly basis and paid for a $10 manicure, I'd be spending $40 a month or $480 a year &#8212; and honestly, that's a low-balled estimate. I live in New Jersey so expect those prices to be higher if you live in New York or another city. On top of that, who has an hour or two every week to get pampered? I wish, but I'm not a Real Housewife.</p><p>On top of that, I prefer to paint my nails dark colors like black cherry, midnight navy, and even black, so it's painfully obvious when my polish starts to chip. I've tried different brands of nail polish and gimmicky products to make my nails last through the week and I've finally cracked the code &#8212; including a quick drying top coat that's my secret weapon.</p><h3>Trust me when I say you'll only need these six products to give your natural nails a salon-grade manicure at home &#8212; and at under $30 total, they won't break the bank.</h3>\n<div id=\"slideshow\">\n\tA nail file\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5c8fee14401d580a860fac58?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Trim nail file\" height=\"600\" width=\"800\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Target</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<h3><a href=\"http://goto.target.com/c/196318/81938/2092?subId1=biip_031819_at-home-manicure&#38;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Ftrim-salon-board-2pk-black%2F-%2FA-11058764\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow nofollow sponsored\">Trim Salon Board (two-pack), available at Target for $1.29</a></h3><p>Now I know what you're thinking: <em>It's just a nail file, they're all the same</em>. Well, no &#8212; not entirely. There are actually <a href=\"https://dtknailsupply.com/blog/best-nail-file-for-natuatal-nails\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">several types of nail files</a>, but the most common one is an emery board. Depending on the type of nail (natural or artificial), you'll need to use different grit levels.</p><p>The lower the grit level, the coarser the file, and conversely, the higher the grit level, the smoother it'll be. For artificial nails, a grit level of 100 should be used, while natural nails tend to require a grit level of 180.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://goto.target.com/c/196318/81938/2092?subId1=biip_031819_at-home-manicure&#38;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Ftrim-salon-board-2pk-black%2F-%2FA-11058764\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow nofollow sponsored\">Trim Salon Board</a> is designed for multi-use.

I'm guilty of committing the age old sin of nail biting, so thin layers of my nail protein peel off and make my natural nails look flaky.&#160;</p><p>I really should stop biting my nails, but it's harder than it seems and it's way easier to spend two minutes buffing my nails anyway.

New housing construction was higher than the latest July figure of 1.5 million for the majority of the months between September 1997 to the end of 2006.&#160;</p><p>The bubble of rising housing prices during the mid-aughts contributed to this increase in new homes being built at such high rates. The <a href=\"https://cepr.net/documents/publications/housing_fact_2005_07.pdf\">Center for Economic and Policy Research</a> predicted that after the housing bubble burst, there would be a drop in construction similar to the recession in the early '80s. Since then, housing starts have not been able to climb back up to such high levels.</p><p>The chart shows that despite a growing population &#8212; the <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/popest/2010s-national-total.html\">US population</a> increased by 6.1% from 2010 to 2019, according to the Census Bureau &#8212; new housing construction has been low in recent years. &#160;After declining from January 2006, housing starts mainly climbed back up since the end of the Great Recession until last January, which had 1.6 million housing starts. Housing starts then fell during the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>A pre-coronavirus analysis by the <a href=\"http://eyeonhousing.org/2020/01/a-decade-of-home-building-the-long-recovery-of-the-2010s/\">National Association of Home Builders</a> looked back at single-family and multifamily housing starts over the past decades. The author said that housing construction couldn't meet demand after the Great Recession, and that during the 2010s \"low levels of production also occurred with falling vacancy rates, declining housing affordability, and rising building costs.\"</p><p>His analysis argued that low homeownership demand during the first half of the decade while more people were looking to rent may have also contributed to the low level of new homebuilding relative to other decades and despite a rising population. Multifamily housing starts recovered first and homeownership demand increased during the second half of the decade.</p><p>Carmen Reinicke <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/us-housing-starts-fell-april-most-record-house-market-coronavirus-2020-5\">reported</a> in May after housing starts dropped to 934,000 in April from 1.3 million in March that Joel Kan, the Mortgage Bankers Association's associate vice president of economic and industry forecasting, said \"tight\" housing supplies and job losses in the sector may mean a slow rebound in housing construction.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/chart-showing-historical-housing-starts-2020-8'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=VriiluZamHA:LkWk7eL-6pA:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=VriiluZamHA:LkWk7eL-6pA:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=VriiluZamHA:LkWk7eL-6pA:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=VriiluZamHA:LkWk7eL-6pA:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=VriiluZamHA:LkWk7eL-6pA:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=VriiluZamHA:LkWk7eL-6pA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=VriiluZamHA:LkWk7eL-6pA:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=VriiluZamHA:LkWk7eL-6pA:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/VriiluZamHA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 31 Aug 2020 13:33:59 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5f48203acd2fec00296a4add?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"11e3ff42a6296390de97672d3f530593","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn73@2020_6/2020/08/31/17-21-53-568_b9a2cb68f3095da5.webp","destWidth":1778,"destHeight":1333,"sourceBytes":353052,"destBytes":353052,"author":"insider@insider.com (Madison Hoff)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5f48203acd2fec00296a4add?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn73@2020_6/2020/08/31/17-21-53-568_b9a2cb68f3095da5.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn51@2020_3/2020/08/31/17-22-14-421_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=VriiluZamHA:LkWk7eL-6pA:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn71@2020_1/2020/08/31/17-22-08-857_18041b058c4957c9.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=VriiluZamHA:LkWk7eL-6pA:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn27@2020_6/2020/08/31/17-21-55-742_971344b064176182.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn76@2020_1/2020/08/31/17-22-07-798_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=VriiluZamHA:LkWk7eL-6pA:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn60@2020_1/2020/08/31/17-22-02-007_8930db699b734893.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/VriiluZamHA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn35@2020_4/2020/08/31/17-22-07-464_276b4b9f94fc47a7.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598894512909},{"createdTime":"2020-09-01 01:21:52","updatedTime":"2020-09-01 01:21:52","title":"Pirated versions of 'Tenet' have appeared online ahead of the movie's US debut","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/pirated-versions-of-tenet-appear-online-before-us-debut-2020-8","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f46344942f43f001ddff0e2?format=jpeg\" alt=\"JOHN DAVID WASHINGTON in Warner Bros.

The order is a monumental defeat for Flynn, whose lawyers have been arguing for the case's dismissal for months.</p><p>Flynn pleaded guilty in December 2017 to lying to the FBI about his conversations with Russia's ambassador to the US at the time, Sergey Kislyak, regarding US sanctions against Russia.</p><p>The former national security adviser initially cooperated with Robert Mueller's investigators in the Russia probe. But he later shifted course by hiring new attorneys who took a more combative stance and asked to withdraw Flynn's guilty plea.</p><p>The DOJ also later changed tactics in the Flynn case over the objections of some of the original Mueller prosecutors and asked the judge overseeing the case to dismiss it, citing insufficient evidence against Flynn. The move prompted a swift outcry from House Democrats who said it was a political maneuver by Attorney General William Barr to shield Trump associates.</p><p>A three-judge panel from the DC circuit court of appeals initially ruled in Flynn and the DOJ's favor and ordered a lower court judge to toss out the case against the former national security adviser. But the full panel of judges <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/michael-flynn-loses-washington-dc-circuit-court-of-appeals-2020-7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">decided to review Flynn's case last month</a>, marking a potential turning point in the proceedings, because the panel consists of more judges appointed by Democratic presidents (7) than those appointed by Republicans (3).</p><p>\"As to Petitioner's first two requests &#8212; to compel the immediate grant of the Government's motion, and to vacate the District Court's appointment of amicus &#8212; Petitioner has not established that he has 'no other adequate means to attain the relief he desires,'\" Monday's 8-2 ruling said. \"We also decline to mandate that the case be reassigned to a different district judge, because Petitioner has not established a clear and indisputable right to reassignment. We therefore deny the Petition.\"</p><p>The case will now go back to US District Judge Emmet Sullivan, who had previously asked a veteran former judge and prosecutor to review the DOJ's motion to dismiss. Sullivan also planned to hold a hearing on the motion that was originally scheduled for July.</p><p>John Gleeson, the former judge who examined the DOJ's motion, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/john-gleeson-files-brief-doj-motion-michael-flynn-case-2020-6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">issued a scathing brief</a> in June saying the department \"engaged in highly irregular conduct to benefit a political ally of the President.\"</p><p>Gleeson added that the DOJ's claim that there wasn't enough evidence to prove Flynn made materially false statements \"taxes the credulity of the credulous\" and was \"conclusively disproven by its own briefs filed earlier in this very proceeding.\"</p><p>Gleeson added that the government's grounds for dismissing the case also \"contradict and ignore this Court's prior orders, which constitute law of the case. They are riddled with inexplicable and elementary errors of law and fact. And they depart from positions that the Government has taken in other cases.\"</p><p>There is also \"clear evidence of a gross abuse of prosecutorial power\" in the motion to dismiss, Gleeson wrote. Rule 48(a) of the federal rules of criminal procedure is meant to protect against \"dubious dismissals of criminal cases that would benefit powerful and well-connected defendants.\" However, that's exactly what's happened in Flynn's case, Gleeson added.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/appeals-court-denies-michael-flynn-motion-to-dismiss-doj-case-2020-8'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=XqIV4fa9GlM:kAUrK4Awgus:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=XqIV4fa9GlM:kAUrK4Awgus:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=XqIV4fa9GlM:kAUrK4Awgus:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=XqIV4fa9GlM:kAUrK4Awgus:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=XqIV4fa9GlM:kAUrK4Awgus:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=XqIV4fa9GlM:kAUrK4Awgus:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=XqIV4fa9GlM:kAUrK4Awgus:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=XqIV4fa9GlM:kAUrK4Awgus:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/XqIV4fa9GlM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 31 Aug 2020 16:31:19 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5f4d24cd7ffa48002894d274?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"b7157dcf2a914b309583d5a88366843a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn15@2020_6/2020/08/31/17-21-56-081_75447b2da38faf97.webp","destWidth":4268,"destHeight":3201,"sourceBytes":844906,"destBytes":844906,"author":"ssheth@businessinsider.com (Sonam Sheth,Darren Samuelsohn)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5f4d24aa7ffa48002894d273?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn75@2020_6/2020/08/31/17-22-00-147_8e169b80f1464bfe.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn51@2020_3/2020/08/31/17-22-14-421_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=XqIV4fa9GlM:kAUrK4Awgus:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn59@2020_3/2020/08/31/17-22-14-413_85fcfeb8aa189418.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=XqIV4fa9GlM:kAUrK4Awgus:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn31@2020_6/2020/08/31/17-22-11-137_e0f9ab2f6332c1c9.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn76@2020_1/2020/08/31/17-22-07-798_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=XqIV4fa9GlM:kAUrK4Awgus:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn95@2020_6/2020/08/31/17-22-21-572_5453cb6dfcbd2e0d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/XqIV4fa9GlM":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn55@2020_6/2020/08/31/17-21-58-643_842f41c431e0727e.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598894512795},{"createdTime":"2020-09-01 01:21:52","updatedTime":"2020-09-01 01:21:52","title":"SUCCESS INSIDER: How 4 Harvard grads built their fast food empires franchising with brands like Wendy's, Taco Bell, Burger King, and Popeyes","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/success-insider-harvard-grads-franchises-gt-daves-kombucha-culture-2020-8","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5e5d2226fee23d03f44f001a?format=jpeg\" alt=\"burger king 2010\" height=\"3264\" width=\"4352\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>A customer walks into a Burger King restaurant on August 24, 2010 in Chicago, Illinois.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Scott Olson/Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>You don't always have to build something from scratch if there's a perfectly good solution already available.

Sometimes doing so only scratches the surface, revealing what Aaron Hurst calls the cause as opposed to the purpose. To dig deeper, deep enough to discover your core purpose, to connect your intellectual sense of purpose with your core purpose, ask yourself why you do what you do not once but five times. Yes, five.</p><p>I was first introduced to the Five Whys as a technique developed by Taiichi Ohno, the founder of the Toyota Production System. Ohno used the Five Whys as the technique to drill down into deficiencies, to permit a deeper look into problems. This practice of asking the Five Whys became standard at Toyota and later became part of the Six Sigma training program. By the repetition of inquiry into a given defect, Toyota found itself better able to discern the root causes of failures and avoid creating further problems brought on by quick, surface-level analyses.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f4951367ffa48002894ceca?format=jpeg\" alt=\"PoslonShannon_AltCrop\" height=\"468\" width=\"625\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Shannon Huffman Polson.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Courtesy of Shannon Huffman Polson</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>How does a manufacturing tactic relate to purpose? By its insistence on getting to root cause, or what I call core purpose.</p><p>Your purpose addresses the task at hand. It considers what you are doing now, and why you're doing it. Your <em>core </em>purpose goes deeper. Your core purpose is what drives you today and every day. It is foundational to who you are, what makes you unique, what forms the core of your being. Your story informs your core purpose, and your core purpose informs the future of your story. In the face of so many competing distractions, discerning core purpose takes quiet and focused attention.</p><p>In the writing workshops I lead, I use an exercise to introduce the concept of the long, hard look &#8212; a necessary step to get to the core truths or meaning the writers are seeking to convey, even if they think they already know. I ask participants to turn toward someone they don't know, and to look directly into their eyes without looking away for a full minute (sometimes two). By the end of the exercise, some participants are squirming, some trying not to laugh, others concentrating hard on pushing through the discomfort. The process is awkward at best, but it can make us realize that the hard look may require us to get uncomfortable.</p><p>Most of us aren't willing to face the places in ourselves that might be challenging, pieces of ourselves that we have worked to ignore for any number of reasons. But in writing, as in leadership (and in all of life), we often have to push ourselves to delve deeper than daily life allows in order to find the meaning hidden beneath the surface.</p><p>The Five Whys is similar, forcing the long, hard look, beyond and beneath \"cause\" and even \"purpose\" in a specific situation, to discover core purpose. By continuing your investigation into purpose until you've drilled down five layers, you'll have moved past the superficial, finding the bedrock of what matters most to you.</p><h2>Digging into my core purpose</h2><p>When I reported for duty to Fort Bragg, North Carolina, I was twenty-three, newly graduated from Officer Basic Course, the Initial Entry Rotary Wing course, and the Apache attack- helicopter transition course. I was ready to fly and excited to lead my first platoon.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f49516e7ffa48002894cecc?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Polson10260_300dpi\" height=\"3010\" width=\"2000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The Grit Factor: Courage, Resilience, and Leadership in the Most Male-Dominated Organization in the World.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Harvard Business Review Press</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Arriving at Fort Bragg, I was the first woman assigned to the regiment, the only woman out of 120 combat pilots. I was assigned not to the platoon I had hoped for, but instead to serve as the assistant to the assistant S-3 operations officer, of 3rd Battalion, 229th Attack Aviation. I worked for a captain who assigned me to type up presentations and appendixes to operations orders. It was not without value, but it was a long way from where I thought I would have been.</p><p>The work soon became deadening, and my frustration heightened when I learned secondhand what a lieutenant in our sister battalion was saying &#8212; that I hadn't been assigned a platoon because I wasn't up for it. Never mind that I knew the other lieutenant to be solidly mediocre in every sense. I talked to the captain I was working for, asking him when a platoon might be possible. He looked up from his desk impatiently.</p><p>\"Lieutenant,\" he said, \"the Army doesn't owe you anything.\"</p><p>I realized with a pang of despair that just because I had been trained didn't mean I would get the chance I had hoped for to be an aviation leader.</p><p>Even so, I remembered the adage passed down by my dad, who had learned it from his parents, who came from farm country in Kansas: if you're scrubbing toilets for twenty-five cents, you'd better earn every penny of that doing the best job you can. I knew that regardless of my disappointment, I had to excel at what I was doing and fight against my frustration. In order to do that, I had to find a way to connect to my core purpose &#8212; and I did it by asking the Five Whys.</p><p>When I first asked myself why I was where I was, why I was doing what I was doing, I started with:</p><p>\"I'm here to fly and fight in the Apache helicopter and be an Army aviation leader.\"</p><p>That might motivate me temporarily, but it was easy to get stuck in the frustration of what I was not doing: flying and fighting in the Apache helicopter. Becoming an aviation leader may have been my purpose (though from Aaron Hurst's perspective, that job-related answer reflected more of a cause than a purpose), but I was not yet presented with the opportunity to do so, and I had little control over the decisions made. Without being able to change my circumstance, the only option I had available to keep me motivated in my work was connecting to my core purpose. I kept asking the question.</p><p>Why did I want to fly and fight in the Apache helicopter and be an aviation leader?</p><ul><li>Because I'm trained to do so. &#8211; Why?</li><li>Because I earned and requested the training. &#8211; Why?</li><li>Because I wanted to serve my country.</li></ul><p>That was a pretty good place to land, but given that I had signed up to join the Army, it was also a little bit too obvious. I forced myself to ask one more time: &#8211; Why?</p><p>&#8226; Because I wanted to serve.</p><p>Boom! That was it.</p><p>I'd grown up in a patriotic family of Midwestern origin. But more important, I had grown up in a family for which faith and the idea of service were important. As a child, I visited retirement homes with my mother, made sandwiches with our youth group for those who didn't have enough to eat, and drove with my father to deliver food to families who needed it on a Christmas Eve.</p><p>I once asked my father, who was newly surprised by a divorce and exhausted from work, why it was that he continued to volunteer so much, serving on boards and on the vestry at church while he worked so many hours. Even as a young teenager, I could see the toll the deep fatigue was taking on him.</p><p>He responded by quoting those words from the Gospel of Luke that President Kennedy had borrowed as well: \"For those to whom much is given, much is expected.\"</p><p>Growing up with both the demonstration of and espousal of service was a key piece of my makeup, and connecting with this value was important to staying strong and motivated in a job that I saw as discouraging, as possibly even unfair, and, in fleeting moments that seemed to be increasing in frequency, as deadening. By connecting to my core purpose, I could see that I was still serving. This validated the work I was doing and empowered me to act from a place of strength. I may not have been leading a flight platoon yet, but by connecting to my core purpose, I continued to see even the menial tasks as an opportunity to serve, full stop.</p><p>Understanding that my core purpose is to serve undergirds all of my subsequent work, informs much of how I spend my time out of uniform, and even more fundamentally, articulates a value that is a significant part of what makes me who I am. It sustains me when times are hard and gives me direction when I feel the need to course-correct. Drilling down to core purpose is fundamental to accessing and developing grit.</p><p><em>Reprinted by permission of Harvard Business Review Press.
