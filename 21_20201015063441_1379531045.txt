And a new documentary about the real men behind the Mercury program set to join it. <strong><em>The Real Right Stuff</em></strong> is a documentary about the Mercury 7 from National Geographic that has just set its premiere on Disney+ this November.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-641364\"></span></p>\n<p>Disney+ announced that National Geographic&#8217;s <em>The Real Right Stuff</em> documentary, which follows the beginnings of the space race, will premiere on the streaming platform on Friday, November 20. Directed and produced Emmy-winning filmmaker <strong>Tom Jennings</strong> (<em>Apollo: Missions to the Moon</em>, <em>Challenger Disaster: Lost Tapes</em>), <em>The Real Right Stuff</em> tells the &#8220;gripping account of NASA’s Project Mercury program, which revolutionized America’s role in human space exploration and inspired future generations of space enthusiasts&#8221; without modern-day narration and interviews typical of the documentary format.</p>\n<p>Instead of narration and interviews, Jennings employs never-before-seen footage and newly synced audio, including the tense moments following the Mercury-Redstone 4 flight, rare early radio and video recordings, new research materials from Tom Wolfe, newly digitized John Glenn home movies captured on 8 mm and 16 mm film, and rare photographs from LIFE Magazine showing the home lives of the Mercury 7 astronauts.</p>\n<p>You can see how that approach plays out in the trailer released by Disney+ below.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3ByCRT0jwns?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>Composed by James Everingham for Bleeding Fingers Music and produced by EGOT winner Hans Zimmer and Emmy-nominated Russell Emanuel, the film’s orchestral score was recorded remotely by a socially distant 44-piece orchestra in May 2020.</p>\n<p>The documentary joins Disney+&#8217;s new TV series <em>The Right Stuff</em>, which adapts of Tom Wolfe&#8217;s 1979 book of the same name, which was previously turned into a movie back in 1983.</p>\n<p>Here is the synopsis for <em>The Real Right Stuff</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Real Right Stuff tells the remarkable true story of the nation’s first astronauts, the original Mercury 7, and pulls from hundreds of hours of archival film and radio broadcasts, interviews, home movies and other rare and never-before-seen material to catapult viewers back to the late 1950s. The two-hour documentary, from National Geographic, complements the Disney+ original scripted series “The Right Stuff” which will premiere its season finale on the same day.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>The Real Right Stuff</em><strong> </strong>is produced by 1895 Films for National Geographic. For 1895 Films, Tom Jennings serves as executive producer and director. The film is edited and produced by David Tillman and produced by Chris Morcom.

In the film, &#8220;a mysterious force that knocks the Moon from its orbit around Earth and sends it hurtling on a collision course with life as we know it. With mere weeks before impact, and against all odds, a ragtag team launches an impossible last-ditch mission into space, leaving behind everyone they love and risking everything to land on the lunar surface and save our planet from annihilation.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Tucci will play &#8220;Tom Phillips, a wealthy car dealer, who&#8217;s married to Brian Harper’s (Wilson) ex-wife, while Bradley is KC Houseman, an eccentric and unkempt genius who discovers that the moon has fallen out of its orbit.&#8221; Bradley is taking over for <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/moonfall-cast-josh-gad-roland-emmerich/\">Josh Gad</a>, who was previously cast in the KC Houseman role but departed over scheduling conflicts.

And honestly, I&#8217;m not going to complain about that. By all means, let Roland Emmerich do whatever insane nonsense he wants. Will it make for a <em>good</em> movie? I doubt it! Will it make for an extremely <em>entertaining</em> movie? Yes, probably!</p>\n<p><em>Moonfall</em> has been kicking around since at least <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/moonfall-roland-emmerich/\">2016.</a> And an early synopsis adds an intriguing element to the storyline:</p>\n<blockquote><p>With mere weeks before impact, and against all odds, a ragtag team launches an impossible last-ditch mission into space, leaving behind everyone they love and risking everything to land on the lunar surface, unlock its secrets, and save our planet from annihilation. But first they must battle an unknown and unfathomable power that will challenge everything we know about the moon, the universe, and ourselves.</p></blockquote>\n<p>That &#8220;unknown and unfathomable power&#8221; thing sure makes it sound like there&#8217;s more going on here than just &#8220;the Moon is hurtling towards Earth,&#8221; and I am here for it.

The project has been in development since 2019, when word came out that <strong>James Wan</strong> (<em>The Conjuring</em>) would be producing it. <strong>Neal H. Moritz</strong>, who produced the original 1997 movie, will be producing this TV version as well, which Amazon Studios Co-Head of Television, <strong>Albert Cheng</strong>, called &#8220;a perfectly twisted update to the iconic slasher movie.&#8221; That quote implies that the show won&#8217;t be a beat-for-beat remake of the movie, although the general premise is staying the same.</p>\n<p>For those who&#8217;ve never seen the film, it revolves around a group of high school friends who accidentally run over a man in a car one night, and instead of reporting it to the police, they toss his body in the water and swear never to tell anyone about it. A year later, they find themselves stalked by a mysterious person who claims to know what they did.

Flanagan has obviously become a very big deal in the horror genre since then, directing <em>Gerald&#8217;s Game</em>, <em>Doctor Sleep</em>, and Netflix&#8217;s <em>The Haunting of Hill House</em>, and I can&#8217;t help but wonder what his version of a movie might have looked like. But here&#8217;s hoping Amazon&#8217;s TV version rejuvenates the franchise after the awful PG-13 sequel <em>I Still Know What You Did Last Summer</em> and the direct-to-DVD junker <em>I&#8217;ll Always Know What You Did Last Summer</em> (which, coincidentally, <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/ill-always-know-what-you-did-last-summer/\">we covered earlier this year</a> in our <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/tag/dtv-descent/\">DTV Descent</a> column).</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/i-know-what-you-did-last-summer-series-new-writer/\">&#8216;I Know What You Did Last Summer&#8217; Series Officially Heads to Amazon, Hooks a New Writer</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=bNxSYhCHAUw:0li-PXEvIwM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=bNxSYhCHAUw:0li-PXEvIwM:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=bNxSYhCHAUw:0li-PXEvIwM:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=bNxSYhCHAUw:0li-PXEvIwM:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=bNxSYhCHAUw:0li-PXEvIwM:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=bNxSYhCHAUw:0li-PXEvIwM:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/bNxSYhCHAUw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 14 Oct 2020 22:00:37 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/I-Know-What-You-Did-Last-Summer-series-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"090256bf4f8fa52977292db9fb04798d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn11@2020_4/2020/10/15/06-34-04-779_4d1b7fc9bb504506.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":21854,"destBytes":11420,"author":"Ben Pearson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/I-Know-What-You-Did-Last-Summer-series-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn11@2020_4/2020/10/15/06-34-04-779_4d1b7fc9bb504506.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn35@2020_6/2020/10/15/06-34-22-559_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=bNxSYhCHAUw:0li-PXEvIwM:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn15@2020_2/2020/10/15/06-34-22-727_f61728d38243e3e7.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn36@2020_6/2020/10/15/06-34-23-540_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=bNxSYhCHAUw:0li-PXEvIwM:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn35@2020_2/2020/10/15/06-34-22-530_4ec51a19409a2aa8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/bNxSYhCHAUw":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn95@2020_6/2020/10/15/06-34-22-622_519de57302a33ae5.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602743642310},{"createdTime":"2020-10-15 14:34:02","updatedTime":"2020-10-15 14:34:02","title":"Ridley Scott to Direct a Napoleon Film Starring Joaquin Phoenix","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=641355","description":"<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-641362 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Napoleon-movie-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"Napoleon film\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Napoleon-movie.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Napoleon-movie-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Sir <strong>Ridley Scott</strong> seems poised to do what Stanley Kubrick famously could not: make a movie about Napoleon.</p>\n<p>A new report says Scott is set to direct an epic Napoleon film called <em><strong>Kitbag</strong></em> which will reunite him with his <em>Gladiator</em> cast member <strong>Joaquin Phoenix</strong>, who recently won a Best Actor trophy at the Oscars for his work on last year&#8217;s <em>Joker</em>. Cue the &#8220;Napoleon dancing down the steps&#8221; memes, and learn more about the project below.<br />\n<span id=\"more-641355\"></span></p>\n<p>Deadline reports that screenwriter <strong>David Scarpa</strong>, who previously wrote Scott&#8217;s <em>All the Money in the World</em> and, as far as I can tell, is still trying to tackle Sony&#8217;s long-brewing <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/cleopatra-movie-thriller/\"><em>Cleopatra</em> movie</a>, will reunite with Scott and write the script for <em>Kitbag</em>, which takes its title from the saying, &#8220;There is a general&#8217;s staff hidden in every soldier&#8217;s kitbag.&#8221; Here&#8217;s how the outlet describes the movie:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The film is an original and personal look at Napoleon&#8217;s origins and his swift, ruthless climb to emperor, viewed through the prism of his addictive and often volatile relationship with his wife and one true love, Josephine. The intention of the film is to capture Napoleon&#8217;s famous battles, relentless ambition and astounding strategic mind as an extraordinary military leader and war visionary.</p></blockquote>\n<p>If I were a betting man, I&#8217;d bet the farm that this film will end up with a different title before an audience ever sees it. Remember, a different film company recently wouldn&#8217;t allow Josh Trank&#8217;s Al Capone movie to be called <em>Fonzo</em> and instead renamed it <em>Capone</em> to appeal to a wider audience. <em>Kitbag</em> is currently set up at 20th Century Studios, which is owned by Disney, a company that doesn&#8217;t strike me as being in the business of leaving audiences confused as to what their properties are. Then again, maybe Scott has earned enough juice through his legendary career that they&#8217;ll let him have this one.</p>\n<p>As for Phoenix playing Napoleon Bonaparte&#8230;sure. Give it a rip. There&#8217;s the potential for this film to end up as the definitive cinematic take on the French emperor, but at the end of the day, I&#8217;m just excited to see these two guys work together again twenty-plus years after <em>Gladiator</em>. Would I love to see Danny DeVito roll off of the <em>It&#8217;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia</em> set and play the role? Of course. Who wouldn&#8217;t? But even though he doesn&#8217;t exactly fit the physical requirements of the character, I&#8217;m confident Phoenix will deliver a layered, compelling performance.</p>\n<p>Scott just wrapped production on <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/new-matt-damon-and-ben-affleck-movie/\"><em>The Last Duel</em></a>.

It&#8217;s the type of scandalous true crime saga that Gillespie tackled with <em>I, Tonya</em>, which suggests he&#8217;s a good fit for the film.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-641311\"></span></p>\n<p>Deadline has the scoop about Craig Gillespie directing the Chippendales murder movie starring Dev Patel. I&#8217;m a bit of a true crime buff, but I&#8217;ll confess I&#8217;ve never heard of this story before. Here are the details, per Deadline&#8217;s story:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The story follows Steve Banerjee (Patel), who emigrated from India to Playa del Rey to chase the dream of fame and fortune. Bored with pumping gas in the Mobil station he owned, he found an outlet for his entrepreneurial dreams when he acquired the struggling L.A. rock club Destiny II. He transformed it with a new name and theme nights that included female mud wrestling and a “male exotic dance night for ladies only,” with the latter catching on. Soon, Banerjee and his partners were presiding over a flesh empire that earned $8 million a year from club receipts, millions of calendars of its main attraction being sold, with a large amount coming from touring companies. Lawsuits and disputes between Banerjee followed, leading to a violence-filled descent.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Weirdly enough, there&#8217;s no mention of murders in that synopsis, so for that, I turn to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somen_Banerjee\">Wikipedia</a>, which adds:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Banerjee was later charged with having enlisted the aid of Ray Colon, in 1990 and 1991, to help carry out a plot to kill Michael Fullington, a former Chippendales dancer and choreographer, and two other ex-Chippendales dancers, who Banerjee felt were competition to the Chippendales franchise. He was also indicted for allegedly orchestrating the 1987 murder of his former choreographer/added partner Nick De Noia. It was also alleged that it was his intent to also have Nahin murdered. He eventually pleaded guilty to attempted arson, racketeering, and murder for hire. He entered into a plea agreement that would have led to 26 years in prison, loss of his share of the Chippendales&#8217; parent company (Nahin retaining his share), and most of his estate.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I thought <em>I, Tonya</em> was <em>pretty</em> good, although its tone was a bit wonky. Thankfully, it was centered by a strong performance from Margot Robbie. I have a feeling the same thing is going to happen here – the tone might be all over the place, but Dev Patel is likely to turn in a memorable piece of acting that makes the movie work.</p>\n<p>This won&#8217;t be the first movie to tackle the story, either. There was a made-for-TV movie called <em>The Chippendales Murder</em> in 2000, which had <em>Lost</em> actor Naveen Andrews as Banerjee. The late Tony Scott was also considering turning the story into a film but never got around to it.</p>\n<p>Gillespie just wrapped on <em>Cruella</em>, the <em>101 Dalmations</em> prequel starring Emma Stone. Patel will next be seen in <em>The Green Knight</em>, provided A24 gets off their butt and releases it.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/chippendales-murder-movie/\">Chippendales Murder Movie From &#8216;I, Tonya&#8217; Director Will Star Dev Patel</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=J3bLr_hqI1c:qU7E1UKVV8A:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=J3bLr_hqI1c:qU7E1UKVV8A:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=J3bLr_hqI1c:qU7E1UKVV8A:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=J3bLr_hqI1c:qU7E1UKVV8A:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=J3bLr_hqI1c:qU7E1UKVV8A:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=J3bLr_hqI1c:qU7E1UKVV8A:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/J3bLr_hqI1c\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 14 Oct 2020 15:30:39 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Chippendales-Murder-Movie-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"d2ad9323bfd98afb154c3453e5b6ae2b","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn60@2020_2/2020/10/15/06-34-03-197_18106e05363c474f.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":13094,"destBytes":6776,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Chippendales-Murder-Movie-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn60@2020_2/2020/10/15/06-34-03-197_18106e05363c474f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn35@2020_6/2020/10/15/06-34-22-559_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=J3bLr_hqI1c:qU7E1UKVV8A:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn22@2020_6/2020/10/15/06-34-22-544_5a5b6fbb6307bcc4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn36@2020_6/2020/10/15/06-34-23-540_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=J3bLr_hqI1c:qU7E1UKVV8A:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn27@2020_6/2020/10/15/06-34-22-712_51d6fab2ad86a369.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/J3bLr_hqI1c":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn70@2020_5/2020/10/15/06-34-22-537_d62a978a372704d6.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602743642324},{"createdTime":"2020-10-15 14:34:02","updatedTime":"2020-10-15 14:34:02","title":"‘Caste’ Movie Coming to Netflix From Ava DuVernay","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=641398","description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/caste-movie.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-641405\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/caste-movie-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"caste movie\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/caste-movie-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/caste-movie-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/caste-movie-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/caste-movie.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>Ava DuVernay</strong> is sticking with Netflix.

The book is described as a &#8220;portrait of an unseen phenomenon in America as she explores, through an immersive, deeply researched narrative and stories about real people, how America today and throughout its history has been shaped by a hidden caste system, a rigid hierarchy of human rankings,&#8221; and is a <i>New York Times</i> bestseller and Oprah’s Book Club selection. Here&#8217;s the synopsis:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Beyond race, class, or other factors, there is a powerful caste system that influences people’s lives and behavior and the nation’s fate. Linking the caste systems of America, India, and Nazi Germany, Wilkerson explores eight pillars that underlie caste systems across civilizations, including divine will, bloodlines, stigma, and more. Using riveting stories about people—including Martin Luther King, Jr., baseball’s Satchel Paige, a single father and his toddler son, Wilkerson herself, and many others—she shows the ways that the insidious undertow of caste is experienced every day. She documents how the Nazis studied the racial systems in America to plan their out-cast of the Jews; she discusses why the cruel logic of caste requires that there be a bottom rung for those in the middle to measure themselves against; she writes about the surprising health costs of caste, in depression and life expectancy, and the effects of this hierarchy on our culture and politics. Finally, she points forward to ways America can move beyond the artificial and destructive separations of human divisions, toward hope in our common humanity.</p></blockquote>\n<p>DuVernay has worked with Netflix on the documentary <em>13th</em> and the original series <i>When They See Us. </i>She&#8217;s also currently producing a limited series for Netflix based on the adolescent life of athlete and activist Colin Kaepernick entitled <i>Colin in Black &#38; White</i>. Tendo Nagenda, who worked with DuVernay on <em>A Wrinkle in Time</em>, will executive produce.</p>\n<p>DuVernay is a strong filmmaker, and while I thought A<em> Wrinkle in Time</em> was a bit of a mess, I&#8217;m always up to check out her new projects.

Are we talking big roles for all of these folks? Or are they going to pop-in for quick, amusing cameos? McKay has worked with big casts before – <em>The Big Short</em> and <em>Vice</em> are both loaded with actors, but neither of this film had <em>this</em> many stars. It&#8217;s going to be a bit of a challenge, but I&#8217;ll leave that problem to McKay and company to work out.</p>\n<p><em>Don&#8217;t Look Up</em> &#8220;tells the story of two low-level astronomers, who must go on a giant media tour to warn mankind of an approaching asteroid that will destroy planet earth.&#8221; McKay wrote the script and will produce under his Hyperobject Industries banner with Kevin Messick. When the project was first announced, Scott Stuber, head of Netflix films, said: &#8220;Adam has always had great timing when it comes to making smart, relevant and irreverent films that depict our culture. Even if he somehow ends up predicting planet Earth’s imminent demise, we’re excited to add this to our slate before it all comes to an end.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Netflix first revealed the film back in February of this year, at which time they claimed production would begin in April. However, the coronavirus got in the way of those plans. But maybe it all worked out for the best, because surely that delay helped McKay lockdown this dream cast. No word yet on when we might see this thing, but with a cast this big, you can bet Netflix will aim for some sort of theatrical release – assuming movie theaters still exist by the time the pic is ready.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/dont-look-up-cast-update/\">&#8216;Don&#8217;t Look Up&#8217; Cast Adds Leonardo DiCaprio, Meryl Streep, Jonah Hill, Timothée Chalamet, Ariana Grande and Many More Alongside Jennifer Lawrence</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=3OPGILte5nk:cvP3XqzJyrA:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=3OPGILte5nk:cvP3XqzJyrA:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=3OPGILte5nk:cvP3XqzJyrA:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=3OPGILte5nk:cvP3XqzJyrA:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=3OPGILte5nk:cvP3XqzJyrA:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=3OPGILte5nk:cvP3XqzJyrA:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/3OPGILte5nk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 14 Oct 2020 20:30:53 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/dont-look-up-cast-update-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"5b25913622d9f19a210c591446263e65","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn27@2020_4/2020/10/15/06-34-03-013_b549879357e86e5e.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":41387,"destBytes":30196,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/dont-look-up-cast-update-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn27@2020_4/2020/10/15/06-34-03-013_b549879357e86e5e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn35@2020_6/2020/10/15/06-34-22-559_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=3OPGILte5nk:cvP3XqzJyrA:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn32@2020_5/2020/10/15/06-34-22-785_97972439d4211062.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn36@2020_6/2020/10/15/06-34-23-540_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=3OPGILte5nk:cvP3XqzJyrA:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn52@2020_6/2020/10/15/06-34-22-722_29198b0d27c59ecb.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/3OPGILte5nk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn23@2020_5/2020/10/15/06-34-22-523_6335f93fd1c75fe3.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602743642331},{"createdTime":"2020-10-15 14:34:02","updatedTime":"2020-10-15 14:34:02","title":"‘Sylvie’s Love’ Trailer: Tessa Thompson and Nnamdi Asomugha Fall in Love in 1950s and 1960s New York","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=641332","description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Sylvies-Love-Trailer.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-641344\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Sylvies-Love-Trailer-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"Sylvie's Love Trailer\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Sylvies-Love-Trailer-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Sylvies-Love-Trailer-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Sylvies-Love-Trailer-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Sylvies-Love-Trailer.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Things get romantic in the trailer for <strong><em>Sylvie&#8217;s Love</em></strong>, a new Amazon movie from writer-director <strong>Eugene Ashe</strong> starring <strong>Tessa Thompson</strong> and <strong>Nnamdi Asomugha</strong>.

In <em>Sylvie&#8217;s Love</em>, &#8220;Robert (Nnamdi Asomugha), a saxophonist, spends late nights playing behind a less-talented but well-known bandleader, as member of a jazz quartet. Sylvie (Tessa Thompson), who dreams of a career in television, spends her summer days helping around her father’s record store, as she waits for her fiancé to return from war. When Robert takes a part-time job at the record store, the two begin a friendship that sparks a deep passion in each of them unlike anything they have felt before. As the summer winds down, life takes them in different directions, bringing their relationship to an end. Years pass, Sylvie’s career as a TV producer blossoms, while Robert has to come to terms with what the age of Motown is doing to the popularity of Jazz. In a chance meeting, Sylvie and Robert cross paths again, only to find that while their lives have changed, their feelings for each other remain the same.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The film hails from writer-director Eugene Ashe, and after this trailer, I&#8217;m kicking myself for missing <em>Sylvie&#8217;s Love</em> at Sundance earlier this year. Thankfully, our own Ben Pearson caught it at the fest, and had great things to say about the flick, <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/sylvies-love-review/\">writing in his review</a>: &#8220;<em>S</em><i>ylvie&#8217;s Love</i> is a soaring, swooning, old-school throwback that’s primarily concerned with wrapping the audience in a sumptuous cinematic blanket of jazz, ambition, and starry-eyed enchantment. And boy, does it ever.&#8221; Ben added: &#8220;This is the sexiest movie at Sundance 2020, and Thompson and Asomugha’s chemistry is so hot, I thought the screen would catch on fire.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The full cast includes Tessa Thompson, Nnamdi Asomugha, Aja Naomi King, Jemima Kirke, Tone Bell, Alano Miller, Erica Gimpel and Lance Reddick with Wendi McLendon Covey, and Eva Longoria. <em>Syvlie&#8217;s Love</em> will head directly to Amazon Prime Video on <strong>December 25, 2020</strong>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/sylvies-love-trailer/\">&#8216;Sylvie&#8217;s Love&#8217; Trailer: Tessa Thompson and Nnamdi Asomugha Fall in Love in 1950s and 1960s New York</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=jKwHlgbjvXw:saOnEERbJA4:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=jKwHlgbjvXw:saOnEERbJA4:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=jKwHlgbjvXw:saOnEERbJA4:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=jKwHlgbjvXw:saOnEERbJA4:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=jKwHlgbjvXw:saOnEERbJA4:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=jKwHlgbjvXw:saOnEERbJA4:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/jKwHlgbjvXw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 14 Oct 2020 19:00:37 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Sylvies-Love-Trailer-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"f5010301a29787cca29f7b1bb4c77d13","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn79@2020_5/2020/10/15/06-34-02-793_0f2ed22bce68c14c.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":38248,"destBytes":24064,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Sylvies-Love-Trailer-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn79@2020_5/2020/10/15/06-34-02-793_0f2ed22bce68c14c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn35@2020_6/2020/10/15/06-34-22-559_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=jKwHlgbjvXw:saOnEERbJA4:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn72@2020_1/2020/10/15/06-34-23-411_6f5445a164a2c4be.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn36@2020_6/2020/10/15/06-34-23-540_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=jKwHlgbjvXw:saOnEERbJA4:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn100@2020_4/2020/10/15/06-34-23-698_83487096eaaa32de.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/jKwHlgbjvXw":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn43@2020_3/2020/10/15/06-34-23-643_9cfdce08907f5df1.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602743642310},{"createdTime":"2020-10-15 14:34:02","updatedTime":"2020-10-15 14:34:02","title":"‘Black Adam’ Adds Sarah Shahi to the Cast of Dwayne Johnson’s DC Superhero Movie","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=641368","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-641374 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Sarah-Shahi-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Sarah-Shahi.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Sarah-Shahi-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>The cast of the <strong>Dwayne Johnson</strong>-led DC comic book movie <strong><em>Black Adam</em></strong> just found its newest addition. <strong>Sarah Shahi</strong>, a very busy actress with numerous television and film credits to her name, has joined the ensemble. But unlike most of the other newcomers to the cast, it sounds like she won&#8217;t be playing a superhero in this superhero movie.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-641368\"></span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://variety.com/2020/film/news/black-adam-dwayne-johnson-sarah-shahi-1234804540/\">Variety</a> reports that Shahi has joined the <em>Black Adam</em> cast, playing &#8220;a university professor and freedom fighter leading the resistance in the fictional nation of Kahndaq.&#8221; In the DC Comics universe, Kahndaq is the home nation of Black Adam, a super-powered anti-hero who rose from slavery to take over his nation, ruling it with an iron fist until he was deposed and imprisoned and eventually released as a serious super-powered wild card thousands of years later. When he&#8217;s not clashing with and occasionally teaming up with other DC characters, he&#8217;s often protecting his land from those who threaten to harm it. From the sound of things, Shahi will be playing the human voice of reason who tempers the violent hero to use to powers for good (and while I could be wrong, I&#8217;ve seen enough movies to make an educated guess here).</p>\n<p>Although it&#8217;s fictional, Kahndaq is loosely inspired by Egypt and other countries from North Africa and the Middle East. So perhaps it&#8217;s appropriate to cast someone as ethnically ambiguous as Shahi, who is American with Iranian and Spanish heritage. While Shahi may not be a famous name, chances are strong you&#8217;ve seen her before since her television credits are about a mile long: <em>Alias</em>, <em>The Rookie</em>, <em>Chicago Fire</em>, <em>City on a Hill</em>, <em>Person of Interest</em>, <em>Psych</em>, <em>Life</em>, <em>The L Word</em>, and much, much more.

The news coming out of theme parks in the last few days has been exceedingly grim, and I’d rather not pretend otherwise. You’ve no doubt already heard that more than 28,000 people have been <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DisneyParksNews/status/1311044474793947137\">laid</a> off from the Walt Disney Company, throughout the vast Parks and Resorts division.</p>\n<p>Before we dig into the details, it should be noted that the official statement from Fellow Josh, Mr. D’Amaro, tries once again to pin the blame for these massive layoffs in no small part on the unwillingness of California Governor Gavin Newsom to allow Disneyland to reopen. It’s true, of course, that Walt Disney World has been operating without having an obvious super-spreader event for the last couple of months. But it’s also true that Florida’s governor, Ron DeSantis, is not Gavin Newsom, in basically every possible way. One state’s governor is perhaps too cautious, but the other is arguably wildly irresponsible in his attitudes towards public health.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-520745 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/disneyparks-wonderfulworldofanimation-frontpage-700x313.jpg\" alt=\"Disney Parks - Wonderful World of Animation\" width=\"700\" height=\"313\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/disneyparks-wonderfulworldofanimation-frontpage-700x313.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/disneyparks-wonderfulworldofanimation-frontpage-360x161.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/disneyparks-wonderfulworldofanimation-frontpage-768x343.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/disneyparks-wonderfulworldofanimation-frontpage.jpg 938w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>More to the point, roughly a quarter of these mass layoffs are <a href=\"https://www.wptv.com/news/state/at-least-a-quarter-of-disney-layoffs-coming-from-florida\">centered</a> in Orlando, so it’s hard to shake the idea that Disney is trying its best to handle a public-relations disaster by pinning the blame on someone else. Whatever the case, these layoffs are devastating in every possible way. Did you enjoy the live entertainment provided by Yehaa Bob at the Port Orleans Resort? Well, sadly, it’s over – he’s been <a href=\"https://www.disneyfoodblog.com/2020/09/29/disney-worlds-yehaa-bob-jackson-announces-hes-been-laid-off/\">laid</a> off. What about the NBA Experience over at Disney Springs? All of those Cast Members have been <a href=\"https://wdwnt.com/2020/10/all-cast-members-fired-from-nba-experience-at-disney-springs/?utm_source=rss&#38;utm_medium=rss&#38;utm_campaign=all-cast-members-fired-from-nba-experience-at-disney-springs\">laid</a> off too. It extends to transportation options, too, like the Minnie Van service, with its Cast Members <a href=\"https://wdwnt.com/2020/10/confirmed-minnie-van-service-retired-at-walt-disney-world-cast-members-included-in-mass-layoffs/?utm_source=rss&#38;utm_medium=rss&#38;utm_campaign=confirmed-minnie-van-service-retired-at-walt-disney-world-cast-members-included-in-mass-layoffs\">being</a> cut.</p>\n<p>I could go on, but you probably get the point. These layoffs are widespread and truly gutting to so many people’s livelihoods, and during a time when the U.S. government continues to waffle over whether or not they should provide aid to countless millions who are unemployed or destitute. If you have the means, I encourage you to give whatever you can, to food banks, charities, and other organizations and people trying to help. Tom Bricker over at the Disney Tourist Blog has compiled a <a href=\"https://www.disneytouristblog.com/donations-food-banks-charities-disney-world/\">list</a> of options for how to help. Please do so if you can.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-441657 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/frozen-musical-6-e1505826629967-700x294.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"294\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/frozen-musical-6-e1505826629967-700x294.jpeg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/frozen-musical-6-e1505826629967-360x151.jpeg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/frozen-musical-6-e1505826629967.jpeg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Some of the layoffs in the Anaheim area are going to be keenly felt by guests whenever Disneyland reopens. (That&#8217;s still a very unknown and murky question, of course.) If you&#8217;re anything like me, you enjoy live entertainment when you&#8217;re at the parks, and two of the very best shows were Mickey and the Magical Map and <em>Frozen </em>&#8211; Live at the Hyperion. You may have noticed my use of &#8220;was&#8221; there; I wish I didn&#8217;t have to use past tense, but according to some <a href=\"https://blogmickey.com/2020/10/frozen-live-at-the-hyperion-and-mickey-and-the-magical-map-reportedly-closed-permanently-at-disneyland/\">reports</a> among Cast Members, the shows are being canceled as an after-effect of the pandemic layoffs. This news isn&#8217;t confirmed by Disney, and it&#8217;s always possible that once the parks reopen, these shows will return. (Mickey and the Magical Map, at least, takes place in an open-air amphitheater.) But for now, it&#8217;s a real downer.</p>\n<p>At Walt Disney World, operations have scaled back immensely. You can take a look at this <a href=\"https://insidethemagic.net/2020/09/entertainment-no-longer-available-disney-ad1/\">list</a> to get a sense of how many other entertainment options have been closed during the pandemic even after the parks reopened. Something to note here: it’s easy to look at a list like this and think, “Well, there aren’t a lot of E-Ticket attractions on here, so what’s the difference?” The difference is that these small touches – from British musicians to lively piano performers – are the kind of special flourish that distinguishes Disney from other theme-park operators. They added to the atmosphere in ways that character or IP tie-ins simply can’t. Rough, rough time.</p>\n<p>Of course, some of the entertainment options being removed will be a lot harder to ignore. To wit, Disney recently acknowledged the inevitable and announced that the yearly Mickey’s Very Merry Christmas Party and the Candelight Processional would be <a href=\"https://www.themeparkinsider.com/flume/202009/7700/\">canceled</a> this year. File this one under “unsurprising but disappointing”, of course. With so many Cast Members having lost their jobs, and since we’re still stuck in a pandemic situation, holding such mass events is risky even for Disney. There’s always the option to watch last year’s events on YouTube, but&#8230;yeah. Like I said: not really an upbeat edition of the column, and I’m not going to try and wrap it up with a smile either. Fingers crossed for something lighter next time, huh?</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/theme-park-bits-say-goodbye-to-two-shows-massive-disney-layoffs-and-more/\">Theme Park Bits: Say Goodbye to Two Shows, Massive Disney Layoffs, and More</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=4fHl68W-mM8:IyXf80Ch3uU:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=4fHl68W-mM8:IyXf80Ch3uU:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=4fHl68W-mM8:IyXf80Ch3uU:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=4fHl68W-mM8:IyXf80Ch3uU:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=4fHl68W-mM8:IyXf80Ch3uU:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=4fHl68W-mM8:IyXf80Ch3uU:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/4fHl68W-mM8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 14 Oct 2020 23:00:49 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Disneyland-reopening-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"b87025cb615427cf9cee5897621e24b4","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn44@2020_2/2020/10/15/06-34-02-881_fcaf34f336a2f589.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":56592,"destBytes":40992,"author":"Josh Spiegel","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Disneyland-reopening-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn44@2020_2/2020/10/15/06-34-02-881_fcaf34f336a2f589.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Peter-Pans-Flight-at-the-Magic-Kingdom-by-Joshua-Meyer-700x486.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn67@2020_4/2020/10/15/06-34-22-718_4c7dfdaff1a44f40.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/disneyparks-wonderfulworldofanimation-frontpage-700x313.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn31@2020_3/2020/10/15/06-34-22-552_37db8eb8df85bac9.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/frozen-musical-6-e1505826629967-700x294.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn74@2020_5/2020/10/15/06-34-22-577_6e029fc3e32a9aea.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn35@2020_6/2020/10/15/06-34-22-559_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=4fHl68W-mM8:IyXf80Ch3uU:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn86@2020_6/2020/10/15/06-34-22-565_69e7ded2a4c6f94d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn36@2020_6/2020/10/15/06-34-23-540_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=4fHl68W-mM8:IyXf80Ch3uU:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn28@2020_4/2020/10/15/06-34-22-544_d97de8f48ff1b8b8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/4fHl68W-mM8":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn27@2020_5/2020/10/15/06-34-23-511_49d9437955609dc3.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602743642332},{"createdTime":"2020-10-15 14:34:02","updatedTime":"2020-10-15 14:34:02","title":"Remembering When Captain America Fell on That Grenade – and Created the Soul of the Marvel Cinematic Universe","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=641301","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-641309 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/cap-grenade-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/cap-grenade.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/cap-grenade-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(Welcome to <a href=\"http://slashfilm.com/tag/great-moments-in-mcu-history\"><strong>Great Moments in MCU History</strong></a>, where we fondly recall great little bits that made us fall in love with the MCU.)</span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After all these years, it’s fun to look back at early Marvel Cinematic Universe efforts. They’re all so quaint in retrospect, so tiny. Thor loses his hammer and has to fight a big metal guy who breathes fire. (Yes, I know he’s called the Destroyer, but he destroys little more than a block of New Mexico’s smallest town). Tony Stark makes his suit, flies around a bit, and has to fight a slower, chunkier Iron Man. Hulk fights some army guys on a college campus and then has to fight an uglier Hulk.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But we didn’t fall in love with them for their bombastic, non-stop action. Early Marvel films succeeded –  allowing bigger Marvel films to mature – due to their casting, their wit, their heart and their willingness to get a little weird with it. This was the age of Nolan’s <em>Batman</em> films, after all. It took guts to make a colorful, pop-Shakespearean <em>Thor</em> film filled with Dutch angles.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Heart is front and center in the first great MCU moment I’d like to discuss: the famous grenade scene from <strong><em>Captain America: The First Avenger</em></strong>.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"more-641301\"></span></p>\n<h2><strong>The Scene</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Steve Rogers wants nothing more than to help people, and in 1943, that means joining the war and punching Nazis (or Hydra folk if he finds any). But despite his infinite spirit and altruism, his scrawny body – and I mean scrawny scrawny scrawny – keeps him from getting in.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But then Dr. Abraham Erskine (Stanely Tucci) comes to the rescue. Recognizing Steve’s full-on Mr. Rogers vibes, he gets him in the military, secretly pegging him for a radical super-soldier serum he’s developed. His counterpart, Tommy Lee Jones’ Colonel Chester Phillips, would prefer they use the serum on a pre-tough mean guy which, let’s be fair, I also wouldn’t mind seeing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So now little Steve’s in the army, trying to prove his worth among a crew of regular-sized, American beef boys. But forget them. The main person he needs to impress is Tommy Lee Jones. Have you ever tried to impress Tommy Lee Jones? No one younger than Tommy Lee Jones has ever succeeded. “I don’t care” is not only his most famous line read, but also his approach to your entire life.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Steve manages it anyway when Jones throws a grenade at his assembled recruits, just to make a point of how disappointingly afraid of grenades they all are. They take their strong bodies and run away like jerks except for our wee hero, who leaps on the grenade without a second thought, hoping to use his tiny gut as an explosion shield for everybody else. This act finally convinces Tommy Lee Jones he has some real hero material on his hands, though no one ponders whether Steve is just enthusiastically suicidal.</span></p>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_bW-pxp_U9k?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<h2><strong>Why It’s Great</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let’s just start with the cast. It’s difficult to beat a scene with Tommy Lee Jones and Stanely Tucci together, especially if they are bickering. Marvel gets a ton of deserved credit for casting their heroes, but even this far back, they did a great job matching support roles with just the right actors. It’s easier for us to love Steve when he can melt the ice around Jones’ heart and earn the warmth of Tucci’s.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Captain America</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the film and the character, would not be so beloved without the consideration and time invested in scrawny Steve Rogers, all peaking here with this grenade sequence. This is a fully-formed character long before he puts on his costume, and his hallmarks remain consistent all the way to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Endgame</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Captain America’s world changes repeatedly, but he does not. Remember, he first utters “I could do this all day” while still in his malnourished </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gummo</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> form.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So from this point forward, and we’re talking six films here, we all know who Steve is: the guy who instinctively falls on a grenade, facing certain death, to help others. His black and white, perhaps simplistic responses weather fierce opposition in the modern world, particularly from Tony “I think I would just cut the wire” Stark, but he never abandons them. Because despite his big muscles and American ass, he never stopped being that skinny kid who just wants to help. Except for that one time where he finally quit fighting and spent his life with the woman he loved instead. He could do this all day, but come evening he’s got other plans!</span></p>\n<h2><strong>What If?</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well, I mean, what if Tommy Lee Jones threw a real grenade and it blew Steve’s guts out all over the other recruits? That would be pretty remarkable too. They’d have to go out and find another indomitably kind and brave and skinny kid as fast as they could. Or they could just be real smart and give the serum to Peggy Carter.

However, the HBO show did leave room for a second season – and it looks like that&#8217;s actually happening. To be clear: HBO has yet to announce an official second season, but someone in the know – Mr. Stephen King himself – says that scripts for season 2 have been written, and they&#8217;re &#8220;really great&#8221; and &#8220;real spooky.&#8221; Sounds good to me.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-641347\"></span></p>\n<p>While speaking with <a href=\"https://ew.com/tv/stephen-king-interview-mr-mercedes-the-stand-the-outsider/?utm_campaign=entertainmentweekly_entertainmentweekly&#38;utm_content=manual&#38;utm_medium=social&#38;utm_source=twitter.com&#38;utm_term=5f8711e98db92f000112af63\">Entertainment Weekly</a>, Stephen King let the cat out of the bag and announced plans for <em>The Outsider</em> season 2. &#8220;There&#8217;s going to be a second season of The Outsider as soon as they can get the production going,&#8221; the master of horror said. King actually penned a follow-up to <em>The Outsider</em> in the form of the short story <em>If It Bleeds</em>, which follows <em>Outsider</em> character Holly Gibney (played by <strong>Cynthia Erivo</strong>) investigating another supernatural foe.</p>\n<p>However, King says that <em>The Outsider</em> season 2 will <em>not</em> be an adaptation of <em>If It Bleeds</em>. &#8220;It&#8217;s really complicated because of the difference in the two story lines makes it difficult to figure out how that could possibly be done in the world of [showrunner] <strong>Richard Price</strong>&#8216;s creation of <em>The Outsider</em>,&#8221; King said. And while he would not give away plot details, he did add: &#8220;I know exactly where it&#8217;s going because I have seen some of the scripts. I could tell you, but then I&#8217;d have to kill you. I&#8217;ll just say that it&#8217;s really great and a real spooky paranormal element.&#8221;</p>\n<p><em>The Outsider </em>followed&#8221;detective Ralph Anderson (<strong>Ben Mendelsohn</strong>), as he sets out to investigate the mutilated body of 11-year-old Frankie Peterson found in the Georgia woods. The mysterious circumstances surrounding this horrifying crime leads Ralph, still grieving the recent death of his own son, to bring in unorthodox private investigator Holly Gibney (Cynthia Erivo), whose uncanny abilities he hopes will help explain the unexplainable.&#8221;</p>\n<p>While King confirms that Holly Gibney will be a character in the second season he doesn&#8217;t say anything about Ralph Anderson returning, so it&#8217;s unclear if Ben Mendelsohn will be back. Of course, it&#8217;s also unclear when the hell we&#8217;re even going to see this second season. Like I mentioned at the top of the story, HBO is keeping mum for now. But King obviously has inside info here, so I&#8217;m going to take him at his word.</p>\n<p>I enjoyed most of <em>The Outsider</em> season 1, although I felt like the pacing was a tad off – there was one episode where two characters take a very long car ride to go get some chicken wings, and honestly, they probably could&#8217;ve left that on the cutting room floor. But I enjoyed Erivo&#8217;s performance, and if she&#8217;s coming back for more, I&#8217;m interested to see how it all turns out.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-outsider-season-2-update/\">&#8216;The Outsider&#8217; Season 2 Confirmed by Stephen King, Who Promises Something &#8220;Really Great&#8221; and &#8220;Real Spooky&#8221;</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=H459vVu5QP0:UvC9j-c2ysE:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=H459vVu5QP0:UvC9j-c2ysE:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=H459vVu5QP0:UvC9j-c2ysE:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=H459vVu5QP0:UvC9j-c2ysE:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=H459vVu5QP0:UvC9j-c2ysE:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=H459vVu5QP0:UvC9j-c2ysE:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/H459vVu5QP0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 14 Oct 2020 21:00:33 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-outsider-season-2-update-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"2bcf5799b2570c5bfac49e167de9ffc6","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn76@2020_1/2020/10/15/06-34-03-938_d493131b48d57566.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":35829,"destBytes":23342,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-outsider-season-2-update-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn76@2020_1/2020/10/15/06-34-03-938_d493131b48d57566.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn35@2020_6/2020/10/15/06-34-22-559_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=H459vVu5QP0:UvC9j-c2ysE:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn3@2020_5/2020/10/15/06-34-23-456_d25741a7be8a4360.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn36@2020_6/2020/10/15/06-34-23-540_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=H459vVu5QP0:UvC9j-c2ysE:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn79@2020_4/2020/10/15/06-34-23-585_c7a3fc7ea4c8c291.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/H459vVu5QP0":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn91@2020_4/2020/10/15/06-34-23-400_b1cba0b2e5f2593a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602743642310},{"createdTime":"2020-10-15 14:34:02","updatedTime":"2020-10-15 14:34:02","title":"‘Hair Love’ Director Sets King Tut Film at Sony Pictures Animation","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=641380","description":"<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-641394 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/King-Tut-movie-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"King Tut film\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/King-Tut-movie.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/King-Tut-movie-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Matthew A.

Cherry will direct <em><strong>Tut</strong></em>, a film about the Egyptian boy king Tutankhamun that&#8217;s being described as &#8220;an afro-futuristic, coming-of-age story&#8221;. Cherry cooked up the idea with his frequent collaborator <strong>Monica A. Young</strong> (<em>Hair Love</em>, <em>The Last Fall</em>), and &#8220;the film will take audiences on a journey through ancient Egypt and celebrate a culture that introduced the world to countless modern conventions and technologies.&#8221; I&#8217;ve never thought about King Tut through the lens of afro-futurism, but that sounds like a really cool, potentially eye-opening prospect, and I&#8217;m excited to see what Cherry does with that story.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve seen pharaohs in animation before – I&#8217;m thinking specifically of Brenda Chapman&#8217;s <em>The Prince of Egypt</em> – but it&#8217;s been a good long while since 1998. And considering the visual dynamism and tactile textures that Cherry brought to <em>Hair Love</em>, the prospect of him whisking us back into the world of ancient Egypt sounds like it could be an opportunity for him to push the stylistic envelope even farther.</p>\n<p>In a statement, Cherry said that he was &#8220;beyond excited to explore the magical world of ancient Egypt through the eyes of its youngest ruler, King Tut.

Tossing her cookies in-between classes when the cocktail of various medicinal chemicals she ingests every few hours upsets her stomach again. Using her inhaler when she wheels down the hall too fast, trying to beat her mom to the mail. Trying to see if that acceptance letter from Washington University finally came, if her wishes finally came true, if she can finally be set free. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chloe wants college so bad she can taste it, and she’s proved herself more than capable of achieving her goals.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the end of the day, Chloe is just like any other teenage girl, only now, she’s being portrayed by someone who happens to represent a marginalized group that makes up nearly 20% of the population.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s been over 70 years since a horror movie was made starring a paraplegic lead. The last attempt at inclusivity was in 1948’s </span><b><i>The Sign of the Ram</i></b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">; a thriller directed by John Sturges (</span><b><i>The Great Escape</i></b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><b><i>The Magnificent Seven</i></b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">) featuring Susan Peters in her first return to acting after a tragic hunting accident left her paralyzed from the waist down. Peters plays a vindictive stepmother who uses a wheelchair and manipulates everyone around her into carrying out her every deceitful whim. It’s a charming little gothic sleeper, a real under-seen gem.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although director Sturges made great strides for representation in the 1940s, sadly, not much has changed in the film industry since then. According to a recent study released by Ruderman White Paper, 95% of characters with disabilities in top 10 TV shows are played by able-bodied actors. The broad study on employment of actors with disabilities in television reveals the “unjust and troubling discrimination of actors with disabilities in Hollywood”, as stated in the white paper commissioned by the Ruderman Family Foundation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In other words, actors with disabilities are the least represented group in all of Hollywood.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Director Chaganty is here to change that statistic. By casting extremely talented newcomer Kiera Allen as the lead character in his sophomore film, Chaganty is bringing representation to the forefront for disabled people with</span><i> Run</i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the same way that he previously brought representation to the screen for the Asian community with </span><i>Searching</i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The onscreen erasure of wheelchair users still has a long way to go, but with the help of allies like Chaganty and his crew, the industry is finally starting to come around.</span></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/run-lead-character/\">Nightstream Film Festival Favorite &#8216;Run&#8217; Features a Lead Performer with a Disability – Here’s Why It Matters</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=2yt45csDY18:jYPb6VOJiCw:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=2yt45csDY18:jYPb6VOJiCw:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=2yt45csDY18:jYPb6VOJiCw:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=2yt45csDY18:jYPb6VOJiCw:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=2yt45csDY18:jYPb6VOJiCw:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=2yt45csDY18:jYPb6VOJiCw:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/2yt45csDY18\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 14 Oct 2020 17:00:04 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Run-700x301.jpeg","linkMd5":"425b96947eee2147f3b1677508dfa52f","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn55@2020_3/2020/10/15/06-34-02-755_4973eb192105b216.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":301,"sourceBytes":64311,"destBytes":49100,"author":"Kalyn Corrigan","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Run-700x301.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn55@2020_3/2020/10/15/06-34-02-755_4973eb192105b216.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn35@2020_6/2020/10/15/06-34-22-559_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=2yt45csDY18:jYPb6VOJiCw:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn8@2020_3/2020/10/15/06-34-22-783_441d8350f683382e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn36@2020_6/2020/10/15/06-34-23-540_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=2yt45csDY18:jYPb6VOJiCw:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn84@2020_1/2020/10/15/06-34-23-448_9b342ab27cb9049f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/2yt45csDY18":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn3@2020_6/2020/10/15/06-34-22-510_4b0e481ed975b223.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602743642310},{"createdTime":"2020-10-15 14:34:02","updatedTime":"2020-10-15 14:34:02","title":"‘Dexter’ Reboot Coming to Showtime, Michael C.

A <em>Dexter</em> reboot will take the form of a new 10-episode limited series that will bring back <strong>Michael C. Hall</strong> as the serial killer who learned to harness his murderous impulses by targeting criminals. The show started off rather strong and then went downhill incredibly fast, ending with a finale that slapped a terrible fake beard on Hall and made pretty much everyone unhappy. Perhaps this is Showtime&#8217;s chance to right a wrong.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-641390\"></span></p>\n<p>Showtime has announced a <em>Dexter</em> revival that brings back star Michael C. Hall and showrunner <strong>Clyde Phillips</strong>, and I have questions. Well, one question, really: who is this for? I know <em>Dexter</em> had its fans, and I was one of them for a few seasons. But the show ran out of steam and concluded with a finale that made <em>everyone</em> unhappy. Is this revival going to completely ignore that ending in lieu of something more palatable? Let&#8217;s hope!</p>\n<p>&#8220;<em>Dexter</em> is such a special series, both for its millions of fans and for Showtime, as this breakthrough show helped put our network on the map many years ago,&#8221; said Gary Levine, one of the Presidents of Entertainment, Showtime Networks Inc. &#8220;We would only revisit this unique character if we could find a creative take that was truly worthy of the brilliant, original series. Well, I am happy to report that Clyde Phillips and Michael C. Hall have found it, and we can’t wait to shoot it and show it to the world!&#8221;</p>\n<p>The original series followed Hall as Dexter Morgan, &#8220;a complicated and conflicted blood-spatter expert for the Miami police department who moonlights as a serial killer.&#8221; Dexter learned to harness his killer instincts for good – sort of – by targeting killers, rapists, and other criminals. But of course, things didn&#8217;t always go smoothly, and much of the series was devoted to Dexter trying to maintain the facade of a normal life. Every season would also see him facing off against another killer. The first few seasons pulled inspiration from the series of <em>Dexter</em> novels by Jeff Lindsay.</p>\n<p>Where the show stumbled, in my humble opinion, was after season 4, where Dexter ran afoul of the Trinity Killer, played memorably by John Lithgow. I thought that season was pretty damn great, and I also thought the seasons after that were unable to recapture that greatness. Showrunner Phillips actually departed the series after season 4, so that might account for the quality dip. If so, bringing him back for the revival is a good sign.</p>\n<p>I bailed on the show before it ended, but all you need to know is that the story concluded with Dexter growing a beard and becoming a lumberjack in Oregon. Will this revival pick up from there and focus on lumberjack Dexter? We&#8217;ll see. The new limited series is set to begin production in early 2021, with a tentative premiere date set for the fall of <strong>2021</strong>.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Surprise Motherfucker.<br />He’s back. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Dexter?src=hash&#38;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Dexter</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/EDXov06rot\">pic.twitter.com/EDXov06rot</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Dexter on Showtime (@SHO_Dexter) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SHO_Dexter/status/1316468804378079234?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 14, 2020</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/dexter-reboot/\">&#8216;Dexter&#8217; Reboot Coming to Showtime, Michael C.

Sound familiar? It seems like <strong>Regina King</strong> is drawing inspiration from one famous Slayer for a new CW series <strong><em>Slay</em></strong>, a Black-led supernatural teen drama that the Emmy and Oscar-winning actress – who recently made her feature directorial debut with the acclaimed <em>One Night in Miami </em>– is developing.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-641340\"></span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/regina-king-slay-cw-1234803102/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Variety</a> reports that King is set to executive produce <em>Slay</em>, a supernatural drama series currently in development at the CW. The series follows Carson Jones, &#8220;a bold, witty teenager with afro puffs, leather boots, seventies cool, and – thanks to her mother’s ancient African bloodline – supernatural gifts and the responsibility to use them to protect Virginia’s Historic Triangle (one of the most haunted areas in the country) from the forces of darkness.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Julian Johnson will write and co-executive produce <em>Slay</em>, with Pam Veasey supervising and executive producing. Regina and her sister Reina King will executive produce via their production company, Royal Ties. CBS Television Studios will produce.</p>\n<p>King has been on a hot streak for the past few years, winning the fourth Emmy of her career with her starring role&#8217;s in HBO&#8217;s <em>Watchmen</em> last year, right on the heels of her wins for <em>American Crime</em> and <em>Seven Seconds</em>. She earned an Oscar last year too, for best supporting actress in <em>If Beale Street Could Talk</em>. And it seems like she is going to keep that streak going strong, making her feature directorial debut with <em>One Night in Miami</em>, which earned acclaim at its world premiere at the Venice Film Festival, and taking on increasingly active roles as a producer.</p>\n<p>The project also reunites King with Veasey, the former showrinner of <em>CSI: New York</em> and <em>CSI: Cyber</em>, who wrote an ABC pilot two years ago which King had directed and executive produced.</p>\n<p><em>Slay</em> is just the latest TV project for King, having long worked both in front of and behind the camera, and it&#8217;s satisfying that she&#8217;s using her growing influence to boost Black-led projects — especially Black-led projects that cater to teens who love supernatural shows. Not all projects headlined by Black actors and creators have to be &#8220;important,&#8221; and it&#8217;s refreshing to see such an accomplished figure like King put her weight behind shows that could inspire a whole new generation of teens — and maybe become the next <em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em> instead of a tired race-bent rehash.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/regina-king-slay-tv-series-cw/\">Regina King is Developing CW Series &#8216;Slay,&#8217; About a Witty Teen with Supernatural Powers</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=Bo72DDBTkDA:kOCIvrv2FpA:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=Bo72DDBTkDA:kOCIvrv2FpA:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=Bo72DDBTkDA:kOCIvrv2FpA:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=Bo72DDBTkDA:kOCIvrv2FpA:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=Bo72DDBTkDA:kOCIvrv2FpA:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=Bo72DDBTkDA:kOCIvrv2FpA:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/Bo72DDBTkDA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 14 Oct 2020 22:30:53 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/regina-king-2-e1602696683283-700x364.jpg","linkMd5":"ad11ddd7ec8bf91a31a4945558290b80","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn31@2020_6/2020/10/15/06-34-04-774_60003fdad4ba8525.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":364,"sourceBytes":48098,"destBytes":32154,"author":"Hoai-Tran Bui","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/regina-king-2-e1602696683283-700x364.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn31@2020_6/2020/10/15/06-34-04-774_60003fdad4ba8525.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn35@2020_6/2020/10/15/06-34-22-559_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=Bo72DDBTkDA:kOCIvrv2FpA:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn64@2020_2/2020/10/15/06-34-23-403_8055c1e7ae982d57.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn36@2020_6/2020/10/15/06-34-23-540_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=Bo72DDBTkDA:kOCIvrv2FpA:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn87@2020_2/2020/10/15/06-34-22-699_d92684f08255e581.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/Bo72DDBTkDA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn3@2020_6/2020/10/15/06-34-22-522_27e1a22cec2faa6f.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602743642312},{"createdTime":"2020-10-15 14:34:02","updatedTime":"2020-10-15 14:34:02","title":"‘French Exit’ Review: The Discreet Smarm of the Bourgeoisie [NYFF]","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=640909","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-640959 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/French-Exit-Review-700x259.jpg\" alt=\"French Exit Review\" width=\"700\" height=\"259\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/French-Exit-Review.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/French-Exit-Review-360x133.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Azazel Jacobs’ previous film, <em>The Lovers</em>, establishes its overarching and consistent tone from the time the opening studio logo appears. A self-consciously melodramatic piece of score cues the audience to recognize Jacobs’ perspective. He humorously heightens the stakes for an otherwise mundane story of aging lovers and their affairs.</p>\n<p>His follow-up feature, an adaptation of Patrick DeWitt’s novel <strong><em>French Exit</em></strong>, contains no less vibrant an expression of Jacobs’ directorial stamp. Yet there’s something slipperier and tougher to pin down here, largely because the droll wit never seems to coalesce around a clear point of view. The result is a satire of New York’s upper crust that feels like it pulls punches, if only because it seems to have no clear direction as to where – and how – Jacobs wants them to land.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-640909\"></span></p>\n<p><em>French Exit </em>does maintain some solid footing throughout thanks to the committed performances of co-leads Michelle Pfeiffer and Lucas Hedges. The pair stars as mother and son Frances and Malcolm, two bored Manhattanites blithely wallowing in their privileged ennui. Both performers commit to conveying a potent affect of gilded indifference underlining their every move, particularly in their line delivery. It’s as if you can feel the wind sweeping their words away as they trail off at the end of every sentence.</p>\n<p>The duo shares an uneasy but agreeable peace after Frances’ absence for much of Malcolm’s childhood, the details of which we can feel from their chilly truce before we learn the history. While their off-beat rhythms might not make much sense to us as the audience, it’s clear the actors are on the same wavelength – and that makes all the difference. Their relationship takes another surprising turn when Frances realizes that she has nearly depleted the fortune of her late husband, a feat she assumed she’d die before accomplishing. With few other options, Frances makes the “sensible” move and absconds to a friend’s condo in Paris with Malcolm, her cat and the remainder of the estate in cash.</p>\n<p>Frances claims she’ll continue to live lavishly until the money runs out, at which point her life will end. Jacobs deliberately makes it a little unclear if we’re supposed to take her seriously or literally. It’s to Pfeiffer’s credit that she can keep us guessing throughout <em>French Exit</em> through the power of restraint in her tightly coiled performance. Pfeiffer works with the same set of icy, seductive tools she has wielded so effectively throughout her storied career. She wields these skills no less powerfully simply because she deploys them within a more tightly constrained range of motion.</p>\n<p>The apple does not fall too far from the tree with Malcolm, a young man cagey enough not to reveal his engagement to Susan (Imogen Poots) to his mother. Fans of Lucas Hedges may recognize the tenor of his pouty performance, though Jacobs’ dispositional outlook toward the character in <em>French </em>Exit makes the familiar feel fresh. It’s remarkable to see his usual stock type in the context of a film that does not view his struggles as a cause for pity or sympathy. When Jacobs views the “sadboi” schtick through a more pathetic lens, there’s fascinating friction between the way Malcolm sees himself and the way the movie sees him.</p>\n<p><em>French Exit </em>starts to get especially wobbly in its Parisian sections where the tone swings from farce to absurdism to satire to domestic drama – often within the same scene. The introduction of a menagerie of new characters from a kooky expatriate widow (a scene-stealing Valerie Mahaffey) to a cruise ship witch doctor (Danielle Macdonald) and even Frances’ husband reincarnated through her cat (voiced by Tracy Letts) add color to the film, but they distract from the clarity.</p>\n<p>Once the novelty of the new faces wears off, we’re left to confront the uneven, jumbled mess of mood. The moments of brilliance are hilarious often, even magical sometimes. But they don’t add up to much within the larger framework of <em>French Exit</em>. The film does not waste the brilliance of its two leading performances. But it doesn’t expand much upon their skilled interpretations, either.</p>\n<p><strong>/Film rating: 6.5 out of 10</strong></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/french-exit-review/\">‘French Exit’ Review: The Discreet Smarm of the Bourgeoisie [NYFF]</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=wwiLRBrk740:Tu4ZpswhiwM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=wwiLRBrk740:Tu4ZpswhiwM:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=wwiLRBrk740:Tu4ZpswhiwM:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=wwiLRBrk740:Tu4ZpswhiwM:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=wwiLRBrk740:Tu4ZpswhiwM:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=wwiLRBrk740:Tu4ZpswhiwM:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/wwiLRBrk740\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 14 Oct 2020 15:00:56 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/French-Exit-Review-700x259.jpg","linkMd5":"4276fa4c80905d6bdecca9fe1b930cf9","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn51@2020_3/2020/10/15/06-34-20-805_b86ef338b94f06c7.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":259,"sourceBytes":31912,"destBytes":22576,"author":"Marshall Shaffer","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/French-Exit-Review-700x259.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn51@2020_3/2020/10/15/06-34-20-805_b86ef338b94f06c7.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn35@2020_6/2020/10/15/06-34-22-559_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=wwiLRBrk740:Tu4ZpswhiwM:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn43@2020_6/2020/10/15/06-34-22-534_bc70472ca969c121.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn36@2020_6/2020/10/15/06-34-23-540_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=wwiLRBrk740:Tu4ZpswhiwM:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn47@2020_2/2020/10/15/06-34-23-359_28719e343d6d620a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/wwiLRBrk740":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn6@2020_3/2020/10/15/06-34-22-525_53ed73cb7da61aab.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602743642314},{"createdTime":"2020-10-15 14:34:02","updatedTime":"2020-10-15 14:34:02","title":"‘Hillbilly Elegy’ Trailer: Amy Adams and Glenn Close Deliver Appalachian Angst in Ron Howard’s Oscar Contender","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=641317","description":"<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-641322\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/hillbilly-elegy-700x249.jpg\" alt=\"hillbilly elegy trailer\" width=\"700\" height=\"249\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/hillbilly-elegy-700x249.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/hillbilly-elegy-360x128.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/hillbilly-elegy-768x274.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/hillbilly-elegy.jpg 1440w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>In the fallout of the 2016 election, J. D. Vance&#8217;s memoir <strong><em>Hillbilly Elegy</em></strong> became a nationwide hit, as media pundits sought to understood President Trump&#8217;s victory and influence over the rust belt states. The notion of the &#8220;Real America&#8221; became a hot-button topic, and one that Vance&#8217;s memoir supposedly captured in all of its depictions of economic anxiety and white working class poverty. Which means it was ripe for a sentimental adaptation by <strong>Ron Howard</strong>, with none other than Oscar nominees <strong>Glenn Close</strong> and <strong>Amy Adams</strong> chewing the scenery and donning bad wigs and old-age make-up to earn their long-awaited trophies. Watch the <em>Hillbilly Elegy</em> trailer below.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-641317\"></span></p>\n<h2>Hillbilly Elegy Trailer</h2>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KW_3aaoSOYg?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>Based on author J.D. Vance&#8217;s book of the same same, <em>Hillbilly Elegy</em> follows the writer (played by <strong>Gabriel Basso</strong>) as he&#8217;s on the verge of landing a prestigious job when a family crisis drags him back to the Appalachian hometown he had spent so long trying to escape. There he&#8217;s forced to grapple with his mother Bev&#8217;s (Adams) drug addiction while reconciling his memories of his sharp grandmother, Mamaw (Close), who raised him.</p>\n<p>Already, awards pundits are speculating that this film will be a major Oscar contender, with special attention to the performances of Close and Adams, who could finally win the Oscars that have long eluded them. And they certainly give performances that the Academy just loves to award these days — overwrought, over-the-top, and with layers of old-age make-up and bedraggled wigs that prove that the beautiful actresses are willing to &#8220;transform&#8221; for the role. It&#8217;s all so transparent and hokey, and I can&#8217;t help but fear that this could be the movie that finally wins Adams her an Oscar, and not the dozens of past performances that actually allow her nuance and complexity.</p>\n<p><em>Hillbilly Elegy</em>&#8216;s timing also couldn&#8217;t be worse — on the eve of the 2020 elections, when the idea of Trump&#8217;s &#8220;Real America&#8221; has long been found to be a fallacy that excuses the underlying racist foundations of the country. If <em>Hillbilly Elegy</em> does gain traction during the awards season race, I can see it becoming this year&#8217;s Oscar villain.</p>\n<p>Here is the synopsis for <em>Hillbilly Elegy</em>, which also stars Haley Bennett and Freida Pinto:</p>\n<blockquote><p>J.D. Vance (Gabriel Basso), a former Marine from southern Ohio and current Yale Law student, is on the verge of landing his dream job when a family crisis forces him to return to the home he’s tried to forget. J.D. must navigate the complex dynamics of his Appalachian family, including his volatile relationship with his mother Bev (Amy Adams), who’s struggling with addiction. Fueled by memories of his grandmother Mamaw (Glenn Close), the resilient and whip-smart woman who raised him, J.D. comes to embrace his family’s indelible imprint on his own personal journey.</p></blockquote>\n<p><em>Hillbilly Elegy</em> is set to debut is in select theaters around the country throughout November ahead of its Netflix streaming debut on<strong> November 24, 2020.</strong></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/hillbilly-elegy-trailer/\">&#8216;Hillbilly Elegy&#8217; Trailer: Amy Adams and Glenn Close Deliver Appalachian Angst in Ron Howard&#8217;s Oscar Contender</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=PULGauut_IU:o5c3IAHc1Co:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=PULGauut_IU:o5c3IAHc1Co:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=PULGauut_IU:o5c3IAHc1Co:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=PULGauut_IU:o5c3IAHc1Co:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=PULGauut_IU:o5c3IAHc1Co:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=PULGauut_IU:o5c3IAHc1Co:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/PULGauut_IU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 14 Oct 2020 16:30:59 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/hillbilly-elegy-700x249.jpg","linkMd5":"42542d7e963c771f8aa1629f43247f37","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn40@2020_1/2020/10/15/06-34-02-756_76fa97e01084ded8.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":249,"sourceBytes":24244,"destBytes":13868,"author":"Hoai-Tran Bui","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/hillbilly-elegy-700x249.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn40@2020_1/2020/10/15/06-34-02-756_76fa97e01084ded8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn35@2020_6/2020/10/15/06-34-22-559_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=PULGauut_IU:o5c3IAHc1Co:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn20@2020_3/2020/10/15/06-34-22-570_904472d50337b8f5.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn36@2020_6/2020/10/15/06-34-23-540_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=PULGauut_IU:o5c3IAHc1Co:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn7@2020_5/2020/10/15/06-34-23-451_aedcf059791ad894.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/PULGauut_IU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn15@2020_6/2020/10/15/06-34-23-438_af8016c26d24ef5f.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602743642311},{"createdTime":"2020-10-15 14:34:02","updatedTime":"2020-10-15 14:34:02","title":"Watch: Oscar-Winning Cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki’s iPhone 12 Commercial","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=641338","description":"<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-641352 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Lubezkis-iPhone-12-commercial-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"Lubezki's iPhone 12 commercial\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Lubezkis-iPhone-12-commercial.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Lubezkis-iPhone-12-commercial-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Mexican cinematographer <strong>Emmanuel &#8220;Chivo&#8221; Lubezki</strong> has been relatively quiet since his stunning achievement of winning three Oscars in a row in 2013, 2014, and 2015.

The resulting project, which features Lubezki&#8217;s narration being read underneath evocative and naturally lit subjects, is more of an artistically minded commercial than a narratively driven short film; it&#8217;s designed specifically to show you what kind of jaw-dropping images this device is capable of capturing.</p>\n<p>Lubezki&#8217;s closing thought – that &#8220;the next great cinematographer or the next great film director is already making movies with one of these devices&#8221; – seems unlikely in practice since the device is not available yet, but his point still stands: this is another step toward the democratization of movies, and if an up-and-coming filmmaker has access to one of these, there should be no (equipment-based) reason why they can&#8217;t go out and make the next great attention-grabbing masterpiece.</p>\n<p>Lubezki shot a commercial in 2018, a VR project in 2017, and Terrence Malick&#8217;s <em>Song to Song</em> that same year. Before that, though, he was very busy shooting projects like <em>The Revenant</em>, <em>Birdman</em>, <em>Gravity</em>, <em>Burn After Reading</em>, <em>Children of Men</em>, and <em>Ali</em>. (Bizarrely, he also shot the 2003 Mike Myers version of <em>The Cat in the Hat</em>, but let&#8217;s forget about that for the time being, shall we?) He obviously knows a thing or two about cinematography, and I&#8217;ll be interested to compare the inevitable movie(s) shot on the iPhone 12 Pro with his commercial to see if others are able to approximate his work.</p>\n<p>Several feature films and impressive shorts have been shot on iPhones already. Sean Baker&#8217;s <em>Tangerine</em> is perhaps the first big example, taking the independent film scene by storm back in 2015, and the always-experimenting Steven Soderbergh has since done it twice, with both <em>Unsane</em> and <em>High Flying Bird</em>.

It was the terrifying dawn of the Atomic Age, spawning decades of paranoia, mistrust, and a widespread and very real fear of the potential annihilation of the human race.</p>\n<p data-pw-in-article=\"true\">Author Stephen Walker brilliantly re-creates the three terrible weeks leading up to the wartime detonation of the atomic bomb—from the first successful test in the New Mexico desert to the cataclysm and its aftermath—presenting the story through the eyes of pilots, scientists, civilian victims, and world leaders who stood at the center of earth-shattering drama. It is a startling, moving, frightening, and remarkable portrait of an extraordinary event—a shockwave whose repercussions can be felt to this very day.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-pw-in-article=\"true\">The project has been in development at Universal for several years, and is being produced by <strong>Tim Bevan </strong>and <strong>Eric Fellner </strong>via their Working Title Films banner, which initially developed the project with <em>Drive </em>writer Hossein Amini. The film is based on Walker&#8217;s non-fiction book of the same name, which tells a historical account of the days leading up to the nuclear bomb that devastated the Japanese countryside and killed over 100,000 civilians.</p>\n<p data-pw-in-article=\"true\"><em>Shockwave</em> will be Fukunaga&#8217;s follow-up feature to <em>No Time to Die</em>, the upcoming James Bond film starring Daniel Craig which was recently delayed to April 2021. Fukunaga has made a mark as one of the most visually striking rising filmmakers with critically acclaimed films like <em><strong>Sin Nombre</strong></em>, <em><strong>Jane Eyre</strong></em> and <em><strong>Beasts of No Nation</strong></em> and his singular style on <em>True Detective</em> and <em>Maniac</em>. He has recently signed up to direct three episodes of the WWII-era limited series <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/fukunaga-masters-of-the-air/\"><em><strong>Masters of the Air</strong></em> for Apple</a>, but <em>Shockwave</em> will likely be an immensely personal project for the half-Japanese filmmaker. And with a hugely accomplished writer like Stoppard, who has written such memorable fare as Steven Spielberg&#8217;s <em>Empire of the Sun</em>, <em>Shakespeare in Love</em>, and <em>Brazil</em> (co-written with Terry Gilliam), Fukunaga is on track for an anticipated follow-up film.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/shockwave-cary-fukunaga-tom-stoppard/\">&#8216;Shockwave&#8217;: Celebrated Playwright Tom Stoppard to Pen Cary Joji Fukunaga&#8217;s Hiroshima Movie</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=fKqTkhtBVNQ:YI-HZGdbdH8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=fKqTkhtBVNQ:YI-HZGdbdH8:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=fKqTkhtBVNQ:YI-HZGdbdH8:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=fKqTkhtBVNQ:YI-HZGdbdH8:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=fKqTkhtBVNQ:YI-HZGdbdH8:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=fKqTkhtBVNQ:YI-HZGdbdH8:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/fKqTkhtBVNQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 14 Oct 2020 18:30:05 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/cary-fukunaga-jane-eyre-e1602697237887-700x306.jpg","linkMd5":"7c14ded9c71282ccdfc53dc46ab51028","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn48@2020_2/2020/10/15/06-34-07-402_ce7fe83f431010f2.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":306,"sourceBytes":33974,"destBytes":21594,"author":"Hoai-Tran Bui","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/cary-fukunaga-jane-eyre-e1602697237887-700x306.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn48@2020_2/2020/10/15/06-34-07-402_ce7fe83f431010f2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn35@2020_6/2020/10/15/06-34-22-559_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=fKqTkhtBVNQ:YI-HZGdbdH8:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn12@2020_5/2020/10/15/06-34-22-567_9cceec35057a491e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn36@2020_6/2020/10/15/06-34-23-540_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=fKqTkhtBVNQ:YI-HZGdbdH8:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn75@2020_4/2020/10/15/06-34-23-666_955030ffda93d3ee.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/fKqTkhtBVNQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn95@2020_1/2020/10/15/06-34-23-417_561a360b10bc7fbf.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602743642312}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-10-15 14:34:02","updatedTime":"2020-10-15 14:34:02","feedId":21,"fetchDate":"Thu, 15 Oct 2020 06:34:02 +0000","fetchMs":50,"handleMs":871,"totalMs":39217,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":20,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"2fbc598270685d2ad3e3de972b0b4ef6","hostName":"us-023*","requestId":"bb9c272d047f4599abc657e1eae3fdeb_21","contentType":"text/xml; charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":664168,"bgimgsTotal":20,"bgimgsGithubTotal":20,"articlesImgsTotal":86,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":86,"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx8":3,"myreaderx14":3,"myreaderx7":3,"myreaderx15":2,"myreaderx6":3,"myreaderx16":3,"myreaderx10":3,"myreaderx32":3,"myreaderx4":3,"myreaderx11":3,"myreaderx3":3,"myreaderx33":3,"myreaderx2":4,"myreaderx12":3,"myreaderx13":3,"myreaderx1":3,"myreaderx30":3,"myreaderx31":3,"myreaderx18":3,"myreaderx19":3,"myreaderx":3,"myreaderx25":3,"myreaderx27":3,"myreaderx21":3,"myreaderx22":2,"myreaderx23":4,"myreaderx24":2,"myreaderx5oss":3,"myreaderx29":3},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-05-30 17:21:38","updatedTime":"2020-09-01 09:23:23","id":21,"name":"/Film","url":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/slashfilm","subscriber":null,"website":null,"icon":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/cropped-ZZ46A5EC75-32x32.jpg","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx64/cdn36@2020_2/2020/09/01/01-23-09-121_cba84478f5ca776d.jpg","description":"Movie News and Reviews This feed is for non commercial use.
