There’s also a lot of useful information on the page for everyone who plans to visit our conference or our website. As of today, there are three documents up there:</p> \n<p><strong>Privacy Policy</strong><br> We make a real effort to protect whatever pieces of your identity pass into our hands, and we want you to have an understanding of what we can and can’t do to keep that data secure.</br></p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<p><strong>Transparency Report</strong><br> It’s reasonable to wonder if sites you visit frequently have been served with a court order demanding logs and information. The transparency report is how you’ll know if it happens to DEF CON.</br></p> \n<p><strong>Black Badge Policy</strong><br> Wonder if that Black Badge on eBay will render you ‘uber’ at the next DEF CON? There are rules, and we wrote them down for you.</br></p> \n<p>As other policies are finalized, we’ll update the policy page. If you need another reason to check it out, consider this: every time someone reads a privacy policy all the way through, a lawyer gets their wings. Or a lawyer does 1d4 of smoke damage. It’s one of those.</p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 04 Mar 2015 23:49:06 +0000","feedId":1958,"bgimg":"https://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-main/post-images/dc-policy.jpg","linkMd5":"9e997eaa01d871e0c1f3f4b82c20ec6e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn72@2020_3/2020/08/24/14-51-56-598_035395a599d726bf.webp","destWidth":300,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":28062,"destBytes":16572,"author":"feedback@defcon.org (DEF CON Announcements)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-main/post-images/dc-policy.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn72@2020_3/2020/08/24/14-51-56-598_035395a599d726bf.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598280692595},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 22:51:32","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 22:51:32","title":"Main Track and Village Talks Torrents are Live!","link":"https://media.defcon.org/DEF%20CON%2026/","description":"<img class=\"postImageFloat scale-with-grid\" src=\"https://defcon.org/images/defcon-26/post-images/dc26vid.jpg\" alt=\"Video archive image\"> <br /> <p>Fire up your webguzzlers of choice, DEF CON fam - all the DEF CON 26 torrents are up and live!

Afterwards there will be an additional but optional challenge to test your newly acquired skills.<br><br> Follow <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ICS_Village\">@ICS_Village</a> or have a look at <a href=\"http://www.ics-village.rocks/\">www.ics-village.rocks</a>.</br></br></br></br></br></br></p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 14 Jul 2017 09:02:42 +0000","feedId":1958,"bgimg":"https://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-25/post-images/ics.jpg","linkMd5":"503e262925597638226f28a59d3d969b","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn100@2020_5/2020/08/24/14-51-56-810_f8507634e4731c93.webp","destWidth":400,"destHeight":400,"sourceBytes":26504,"destBytes":23066,"author":"feedback@defcon.org (DEF CON Announcements)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-25/post-images/ics.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn100@2020_5/2020/08/24/14-51-56-810_f8507634e4731c93.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598280692571},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 22:51:32","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 22:51:32","title":"DEF CON 23 Video on YouTube: Internet of Things!","link":"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9fPq3eQfaaBAmA0G2oEptwL0tpCAZJ_b","description":"<img src=\"https://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-23/post-images/iot.jpg\" alt=\"IOT Village image\"> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9fPq3eQfaaBAmA0G2oEptwL0tpCAZJ_b\">Today’s batch of presentations</a> are all related to the Internet of (Questionably Secured) Things.</p> <p>From the main series we have:<br> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEpuEprQ5VU&amp;list=PL9fPq3eQfaaBAmA0G2oEptwL0tpCAZJ_b&amp;index=1\">Runa Sandvik and Michael Auger - When the IoT Attacks: Hacking a Linux-Powered Rifle</a><br> and<br> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgNT05l6Jlw&amp;list=PL9fPq3eQfaaBAmA0G2oEptwL0tpCAZJ_b&amp;index=2\">Qing Yang - I’m a Newbie and Yet I Can Hack Zigbee</a></br></br></br></p> <p>And from the IoT Village: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=majPZcqlVjI&amp;list=PL9fPq3eQfaaBAmA0G2oEptwL0tpCAZJ_b&amp;index=3\">Wesley Wineberg - Cameras, Thermostats and Home Automation Controllers</a><br> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7tdfFRLBuY&amp;list=PL9fPq3eQfaaBAmA0G2oEptwL0tpCAZJ_b&amp;index=4\">K Reid Wrightman - Vulnerability Inheritance in PLCs</a><br> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QFaPLoN65Y&amp;list=PL9fPq3eQfaaBAmA0G2oEptwL0tpCAZJ_b&amp;index=5\">Kenneth Shaw - The Grid: A Multiplayer Game of Destruction</a><br> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhxHHD790nw&amp;list=PL9fPq3eQfaaBAmA0G2oEptwL0tpCAZJ_b&amp;index=6\">Daniel Miessler - IoT Attack Surface Mapping</a><br> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTirAI-B-dI&amp;list=PL9fPq3eQfaaBAmA0G2oEptwL0tpCAZJ_b&amp;index=7\">Brian Knopf - Yes, You Can Walk on Water</a><br> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOvzsnIQPyA&amp;list=PL9fPq3eQfaaBAmA0G2oEptwL0tpCAZJ_b&amp;index=8\">Aaron Guzman - Security: The IoT World</a></br></br></br></br></br></p> <p>As always, spread the word, share the knowledge and stay tuned for the next batch.</p></img>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 04 Dec 2015 18:46:41 +0000","feedId":1958,"bgimg":"https://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-23/post-images/iot.jpg","linkMd5":"b36dafdcff1d794b4c00fbbd8b043047","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn28@2020_5/2020/08/24/14-51-51-907_931f5d83c3bbdaeb.webp","destWidth":400,"destHeight":313,"sourceBytes":38544,"destBytes":21756,"author":"feedback@defcon.org (DEF CON Announcements)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-23/post-images/iot.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn28@2020_5/2020/08/24/14-51-51-907_931f5d83c3bbdaeb.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598280692588},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 22:51:32","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 22:51:32","title":"DC813 is holding a CTF!","link":"https://forum.defcon.org/forum/general-area/defcon-group-forums-and-or-links/u-s-defcon-group-forums-and-or-links/dc813-tampa-fl/224713-ctf-competition-fundraiser-for-dc813-january-21-2017","description":"<img src=\"https://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-main/post-images/dc813ctf.jpg\" alt=\"DCG 813 image\"> <br /> <p><a href=\"https://forum.defcon.org/forum/general-area/defcon-group-forums-and-or-links/u-s-defcon-group-forums-and-or-links/dc813-tampa-fl/224713-ctf-competition-fundraiser-for-dc813-january-21-2017\">DC813 is holding a CTF competition in January</a>.

You can even watch the presentation live on CSPAN 2 - The Dark Tangent is headlining the event!<br><br> During the weekend of DEF CON 25, every single device in the Voting Village was compromised. The report we’re releasing today gives a glimpse into how much we were able to discover in only a few days. Any committed threat actor would devote vastly more time and resources, and we believe that democratic governments must treat the security of election systems with the same rigor and investment as they do their borders.<br><br> We entered into this experiment as a non-partisan public service, believing that discussion about solutions has to start with a realistic assessment of what needs fixing. The DEF CON community has a lot of talent in that kind of work, and we saw a way we could contribute.<br><br> We would like to thank everyone who joined us in the Voting Village to test the machines, everyone who collaborated on the report, the Atlantic Council for helping us share the results and the Library of Congress for granting an easement of the DMCA provisions that would have blocked this research. This project is a great example of government making room for independent researchers to bring their talents to an issue that matters to all of us. Here’s hoping there will be more success stories like this one.</br></br></br></br></br></br></p></img>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 10 Oct 2017 14:31:19 +0000","feedId":1958,"bgimg":"https://defcon.org/images/defcon-25/post-images/voting-machine.jpg","linkMd5":"f22cb4bc2447af030e96705e42ccddbe","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn47@2020_3/2020/08/24/14-51-53-372_d5c53b96c2678fc4.webp","destWidth":300,"destHeight":225,"sourceBytes":24194,"destBytes":16240,"author":"feedback@defcon.org (DEF CON Announcements)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://defcon.org/images/defcon-25/post-images/voting-machine.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn47@2020_3/2020/08/24/14-51-53-372_d5c53b96c2678fc4.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598280692599},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 22:51:32","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 22:51:32","title":"Update: DEF CON 101 has Moved!","link":"https://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-23/dc-23-news.html#dc23101moved","description":"<img src=\"https://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-23/post-images/101moved.jpg\" alt=\"101 sign at Gold image\"> <p>In order to ease some of yesterday's congestion, DC101 track is now located in the Gold Room in Bally’s.

DND tag on the door too long triggers a security visit.<br> 2. That security visit is supposed to be by hotel security staff who are clearly identifiable as hotel security staff.<br> 3. That visit should be comprised of a visual survey of the main segments of the hotel room, with no fiddling about in personal belongings.<br><br> This means that entering rooms and taking a quick look around does not violate the hotel’s policies.<br><br> But it also means that reports of opening closed bags, confiscation of personal effects, and reluctance to self-identify and/or allow guests to verify the legitimacy of the security officers all fall well outside of the policy.<br><br> Please know we are not letting this go.

His CV runs deeper than the Mariana trench and is more Renaissance than the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles combined. Perhaps originally and best known for his artisinal music crafting (collaborating on projects with Meat Beat Manifest, Slayer, Chuck D.) and turntablism , he's become a university music professor (EGS, Switzerland), author (too much stuff to list), and an executive director of Origin Magazine. He's had his works featured in major museums like the Warhol, The Whitney, the Museum of Contemporary Art (Chicago), blahblahblahblah the pseudo-anonymous writer of this announcement could go ad infinitum.

Meetings are being met, plans are being planned, and the theme is ready for its unveiling.<br><br> DEF CON 26 was about the inflection point between disorder and dystopia - the moment before point of no return. This year's theme, in a way, responds to '1983' with new questions. What does it look like when we make the better choice? What kind of world do we hack together in the sunniest timeline? How does our real best-case scenario compare to the future we've been dreaming of for generations?<br><br> So, we offer you 'Technology's Promise'. It's a break from the dystopian imagery into a major-key, blue-sky thoughtscape, full of color and light. It's a future where we have tamed some of the more intractable problems that plague us in the present, where technology supports and inspires instead of controlling and surveilling.<br><br> To get you in the proper mindset, here's some media to sample:<br><br> Star Trek TOS - because the series is based on a future Earth that has learned to manage itself, make working alliances with neighbors and turn its attention to the disciplined exploration of the broader universe. Also LCARS is still cool.<br><br> Asimov's Robot series - a future where humankind has built AI android tech that supports rather than supplants humanity, and (usually) behaves itself admirably.<br><br> BioShock - a genuinely thought-provoking game about the promises and limits of tech-based utopia.<br><br> Kraftwerk, Com Truise, Tangerine Dream - the beautiful sounds of our neon future, rendered in the gorgeously synthesized tones that can only come from the fruitful marriage of human and machine.<br><br> We'll be posting more of this as DC27 approaches. Lots more.

It’s a fascinating and troubling presentation that should generate much-needed discussion about how we secure the entire digital lifecycle.</p></img>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 14 Aug 2015 20:03:09 +0000","feedId":1958,"bgimg":"https://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-23/post-images/kill-you-cap.jpg","linkMd5":"63ed0fed0bd818dbdee6b475f96bc72d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn83@2020_3/2020/08/24/14-51-42-222_ce66460bf4f674fa.webp","destWidth":400,"destHeight":224,"sourceBytes":27974,"destBytes":14790,"author":"feedback@defcon.org (DEF CON Announcements)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-23/post-images/kill-you-cap.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn83@2020_3/2020/08/24/14-51-42-222_ce66460bf4f674fa.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598280692590},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 22:51:32","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 22:51:32","title":"SE Village Talks are Live on YouTube!","link":"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9fPq3eQfaaDdpnt8S6FGLCoDmNTxn3kc","description":"<img src=\"https://defcon.org/images/defcon-26/post-images/sevillage-logo.png\" alt=\"SE village logo image\"> <br /> <p>More DEF CON 26 videos up on YouTube!

We hope you’ll take some time to read it in full.</p> In the Voting Village’s second year, the selection of devices was expanded to more than 30 machines, all but one of which are still in use across the USA right now. We also made a very successful effort to attract election officials to observe, participate and even get training from cybersecurity experts.<br><br> The many vulnerabilities discovered are listed in some detail. For example:<br><br> \"A voting machine that is currently used in 26 states is vulnerable to be remotely hacked via anetwork attack. Because the device in question is a high-speed unit designed to process a high volume of ballots for an entire counties, hacking just one of these machines could enable an attacker to flip the Electoral College and determine the outcome of a presidential election.<br><br> A second critical vulnerability in the same machine was disclosed to the vendor a decade ago, yet that machine, which was used into 2016, still contains the flaw.<br><br> Another machine used in 18 states was able to be hacked in only two minutes, while it takes the average voter six minutes to vote.”<br><br> While these results are cause for concern, the DEF CON Voting Village also provided Election Day Crisis Communications Protocols with the aim of suggesting clear best practices to mitigate the exploitation of the election infrastructure.<br><br> Please share this report widely. The only curative measure for misleading headlines is accurate information, and the security of our democratic process requires that we understand the problem clearly. If you are concerned about the vote tech in your area, get in touch with your local representatives. If they’re not aware of our project, share it with them.<br><br> We want to thank the organizers of the Voting Village, the election officials from around the nation who came to learn from our research and the hackers at DEF CON who brought their talent and ingenuity to the task of securing our voting process.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p></img>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 27 Sep 2018 18:27:54 +0000","feedId":1958,"bgimg":"https://defcon.org/images/defcon-26/villages/voting.jpg","linkMd5":"e140b03be4d27f0c4489b2a54fb6550e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn60@2020_5/2020/08/24/14-51-45-116_538ba04f76f12f7d.webp","destWidth":300,"destHeight":296,"sourceBytes":16185,"destBytes":8500,"author":"feedback@defcon.org (DEF CON Announcements)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://defcon.org/images/defcon-26/villages/voting.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn60@2020_5/2020/08/24/14-51-45-116_538ba04f76f12f7d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598280692541},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 22:51:32","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 22:51:32","title":"DC22 Artwork Contest: Only Two Weeks Left!","link":"https://defcon.org/html/defcon-22/dc-22-artwork-contest.html","description":"<figure>\n <img src=\"https://defcon.org/images/defcon-main/ac-montage.jpg\" alt=\"montage of past art contest winners\" />\n</figure> \n<p>We know that art takes time.

So that's our theme. <br><br> To translate that feeling into the physical space of DEF CON 2020, we offer these bits of inspiration.<br><br> The color palette is derived from internet publications of the early 1990s. It was the breakthrough moment of The Web. As people raced to define the new frontier, magazines like Mondo2000 and Wired tried to convey the excitement with loud colors and edgy layouts.<br><br> The style we took from 90s 'zine culture - an amazing, boundlessly creative and wildly unprofessional DIY movement that, just like the internet, invited everyone to stop consuming culture and start creating and sharing it. Ideas over production value, attitude over polish, getting your ideas out over getting them perfect.<br><br> We hope you'll take that anarchic DIY spirit with you when you're working on whatever you're bringing to DEF CON.

We've accepted a record number of villages and are growing the number of workshops from last year. To hold all this goodness we are growing to include the Flamingo hotel.<br><br> <strong>TL/DR</strong><br><br> - DEF CON has has accepted more villages than ever before and needs to grow.<br> - DEF CON is spreading to two hotels, Caesars Palace and the Flamingo.<br> - This lets us do more stuff + evening pool parties.<br><br> <strong>The PLAN:</strong><br> For DEF CON 26 we will try something we have never done - Split the con between two hotels! No, not like Paris + Ballys, they are connected. I'm talking Caesars Palace and the Flamingo across the street.<br><br> \"That's Crazy!\" you say. \"Why do we need that much space?\" you say. Check this out: The number of villages will almost double from last year to about 25. Parties should increase. More contests are under development. DEF CON needs space to support all the awesome projects from the community and I'd really like to throw some pool parties. That is all now possible.<br><br> In the next month you will hear more specifics but I want to answer some questions here:<br><br> - How will the space be split? The Flamingo will hold some of the \"destination\" events to relieve pressure off of Caesars Palace. Current planning includes Workshops, DEF CON 101 track, some villages and contests, a chill out space, pool parties, and more once we finish planning.<br><br> - Will there be DC TV at the Flamingo? Yes DC TV will be in the Flamingo and as many other hotels as we can wire. A more definitive list soon, but we are building on what we did last year.<br><br> - If you ran a village or contest last year you should count on the same or more space you got last year. If you are running a first time event we will work to meet all of your needs. If you want even more space or a dedicated spot at the Flamingo we can work on making that happen.<br><br> <strong>Background:</strong> <br> With the move to Caesars Palace last year we got more space and a different floor plan that helped with some flow, but the broken escalators stole some of those gains. For DEF CON 26 the escalators are fixed and we have a better understanding of how to use the space. With that understanding and the growth of interest in Village and Contests we realized that we are out of space and need to span to a new property. This growth will allow us to accept more contests and villages and try some new stuff while giving existing events some room to breathe. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>  \n<p> </p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 25 Apr 2018 21:10:54 +0000","feedId":1958,"bgimg":"https://defcon.org/images/defcon-26/post-images/flamingoannounce.png","linkMd5":"60aeefbc556e508e3f897ddd7f335e94","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn11@2020_3/2020/08/24/14-51-48-820_097670ad0584a39a.webp","destWidth":300,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":61603,"destBytes":33300,"author":"feedback@defcon.org (DEF CON Announcements)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://defcon.org/images/defcon-26/post-images/flamingoannounce.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn11@2020_3/2020/08/24/14-51-48-820_097670ad0584a39a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598280692544},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 22:51:32","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 22:51:32","title":"Stay up to Speed with the DEF CON Calendar!","link":"https://forum.defcon.org/calendar","description":"<img src=\"https://defcon.org/images/defcon-28/post-images/calendar.jpg\" alt=\"DEF CON Forums Calendar image\"> <br /> <p>The <a href=\"https://forum.defcon.org/calendar\">DEF CON calendar</a> on the DEF CON Forums is pretty handy.

In case it's new to you, the X-Hour Film Contest is a guerilla-style moviemaking challenge where the participants have to write, shoot and edit a short film during DEF CON.</p> <p>To make it even tougher, the crews don't get the requirements until they're on site. It's a pretty hard task, but DEF CON people pay little respect to the impossible and show open hostility to the merely difficult. The difficult gets done.</p> <p>You can see all of this year's entries, and learn how to participate on the X-Hour site : </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.xhourfilmcontest.com/defcon-23-films.html\">https://www.xhourfilmcontest.com/defcon-23-films.html</a></p> <p>Think you can do better?

You can be part of the one in your area, and if there isn’t one you can start one - it’s free and the information is available at <a href=\"https://www.defcon.org/https://defcongroups.org\">https://www.defcon.org/https://defcongroups.org</a>.</p> <p>This week we’re sharing <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUY8aQqCSRU\">a talk on 3D printing given at DC719</a>, the DEF CON Group for the Colorado Springs area. Dana G. Neilson presents on the history and uses of 3D printing and shows how they made a pretty cool DEF CON ring as a handy example. More importantly he shows that what ever sector you work in or what ever you want to make, if you can visualize it, draw it and either CAD (Computer Aided Drafting) it or have someone else CAD it, then your ideas can become physical object. There are endless possibilities with this growing technology, become part of its growth and then share what you know.</p> <p>If you’re in the Colorado Springs area and want to learn more about DC719, they’re online at <a href=\"http://www.dc719.net\">dc719.net</a>.

The Medical Industry is one of the last to be touched by technology. We have placed doctors and the study of medicine on an altar for years; the time of ivory towers, pedestals, and information isolation has come to an end.

The version given to all the DEF CON Goons is the same as below but also includes confidential reporting phone numbers.</p> <h4>ATTENDEE REPORTED INCIDENT POLICY</h4> <p>DEF CON does not tolerate harassment of any kind, be it racial, sexual, physical, political, intellectual, or emotional. Every Goon shall take each report by an attendee seriously, and not dismiss any of them. Never turn an attendee away. It is not a Goon’s duty to judge anything that an attendee says, regardless of opinions of the attendee, the person they’re reporting, or the reported issue itself.<br><br> <strong>Reported/Observed Harassment or Assault</strong><br> When an attendee reports harassment or assault to any Goon follow this procedure:<br><br> 1. Get a second Goon to be with you to listen to the report.<br> 2. Have one goon contact a SOC goon via the SOC Contact Procedures<br> 3. Make a warm hand off with the attendee to the SOC Department.<br> 4. Let the SOC conduct their investigation and handle the incident from there.<br> 5. Be available to answer any questions from the SOC or venue security.<br><br> <strong>Interaction with Social and Traditional Media</strong><br> DO NOT SHARE photos or videos. Please let the responding SOC GOONS know if you have any video or pictures, they may end up being evidence, but out of context could cause problems.<br><br> During or after an incident, you may be asked to comment on the situation. DO NOT make any comments to reporters, and do not post about the incident on social media. As a Goon, the media will treat anything you say as an official statement from DEF CON. Commenting prematurely before we understand the situation could cause more confusion or reveal identities that should remain confidential so please refrain from speculating and work with SOC / PRESS to help them understand what happened.<br><br> Refer all media inquiries to the DEF CON Press Department (press@defcon.org or send them to the press room) </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p></img>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Mon, 06 Aug 2018 22:59:32 +0000","feedId":1958,"bgimg":"https://defcon.org/images/defcon-26/post-images/goon.png","linkMd5":"6a79b8355b1ebb6b3fc745825f64a5e2","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn47@2020_5/2020/08/24/14-52-01-539_3f0249acef7cddca.webp","destWidth":300,"destHeight":420,"sourceBytes":67236,"destBytes":44370,"author":"feedback@defcon.org (DEF CON Announcements)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://defcon.org/images/defcon-26/post-images/goon.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn47@2020_5/2020/08/24/14-52-01-539_3f0249acef7cddca.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598280692543},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 22:51:32","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 22:51:32","title":"Bank error in your favor!","link":"https://www.defcon.org/index.html#rioroomrate","description":"<p>When we announced the discount room rates for the Rio last month, there was some kind of glitch in the Matrix.

A world where adventurous digital misfits are building a new world out of the pixels and info the Powers that Be leave behind. <br /> <img src=\"https://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-25/post-images/dc-25-city.jpg\" alt=\"DEF CON 25 theme image\"> <br /> <br />We've come a long way together, from the obscurity of BBS life to Runner-Up for Time's Person of the Year. From 20 people at the CON to 20,000. From media scapegoat to – well, it's a work in progress. <br /> <p>Join us at Caesars Palace to look back at how we got here, and to imagine together where we go next.</p></img></img></img></img>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Sat, 24 Dec 2016 00:10:56 +0000","feedId":1958,"bgimg":"https://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-25/post-images/dc-25-logo.jpg","linkMd5":"573f3a8f5f65f8a32c17e5ab230241e7","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn83@2020_5/2020/08/24/14-51-53-768_e08025e2506f866a.webp","destWidth":650,"destHeight":290,"sourceBytes":32172,"destBytes":13452,"author":"feedback@defcon.org (DEF CON Announcements)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-25/post-images/dc-25-logo.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn83@2020_5/2020/08/24/14-51-53-768_e08025e2506f866a.webp","https://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-25/post-images/dc-25-arcade.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn16@2020_2/2020/08/24/14-52-06-100_695ee4365a911275.webp","https://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-25/post-images/dc-25-community.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn52@2020_5/2020/08/24/14-52-06-533_356fe7e21344fe0f.webp","https://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-25/post-images/dc-25-city.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn100@2020_2/2020/08/24/14-52-06-216_7a8e91b3d3e40eab.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598280692575},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 22:51:32","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 22:51:32","title":"Happy Halloween!","link":"https://defcon.org/index.html#halloween19","description":"<img src=\"https://defcon.org/images/defcon-main/post-images/halloween-19.jpg\" alt=\"DEF CON halloween 2019 image\" />","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 19:22:37 +0000","feedId":1958,"bgimg":"https://defcon.org/images/defcon-main/post-images/halloween-19.jpg","linkMd5":"641331af7274e67938049024a14ee874","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn44@2020_1/2020/08/24/14-51-59-291_2b2164579756b597.webp","destWidth":300,"destHeight":329,"sourceBytes":43963,"destBytes":20114,"author":"feedback@defcon.org (DEF CON Announcements)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://defcon.org/images/defcon-main/post-images/halloween-19.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn44@2020_1/2020/08/24/14-51-59-291_2b2164579756b597.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598280692535},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 22:51:32","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 22:51:32","title":"Better Know a Contest - Film Contest Edition!","link":"http://xhourfilmcontest.com","description":"<img src=\"https://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-25/post-images/tdfrancis.jpg\" alt=\"DEF CON td francis image\"> <br /> The TD Francis X-Hour Film Contest is back!

Make it simple to understand, express in broad strokes what kind of behavior is not acceptable, and don't be too specific.<br><br> I wanted it to act as a template for other conferences, if they chose to do so. It was legally reviewed by our outside law firm and a specialist. In 2018, it's looking like it may get seriously crash tested.<br><br> The Code of Conduct assumes people are acting in good faith and not creating intentionally elaborate, dishonest or disingenuous claims of harm. \"Ah ha! This is where the bad actors will attack the CoC\" you may be thinking.<br><br> As a conference of hackers, our CoC is intentionally flexible: like a spoon in the matrix. We describe generally what is not acceptable as opposed to trying to enumerate 42 different bad behaviors.<br><br> Besides the CoC, DEF CON has several structural factors that are to our advantage when dealing with people intent on disruption. This is not our first conference, and as such we have a department dedicated to dealing with this problem. We have also had time to plan with hotel and casino security should we need their involvement. We take this issue very seriously and choose to err on the side of removing people, rather than allow them to spoil the conference for those who just want to contribute in a positive way.<br><br> Finally, I have always said that DEF CON is what you make of it. I want to make sure our community has all the tools necessary to identify and report unacceptable behavior. Together, we will have all the pieces in place to act quickly and professionally, no matter what the issue is.<br><br> The Dark Tangent</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p></img>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Sun, 29 Jul 2018 15:43:24 +0000","feedId":1958,"bgimg":"https://defcon.org/images/defcon-26/post-images/coc-post.jpg","linkMd5":"a889dc873c63280d8cba9fd0e4cb13c4","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn48@2020_5/2020/08/24/14-51-43-930_2755668efc69e03d.webp","destWidth":300,"destHeight":264,"sourceBytes":30056,"destBytes":13968,"author":"feedback@defcon.org (DEF CON Announcements)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://defcon.org/images/defcon-26/post-images/coc-post.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn48@2020_5/2020/08/24/14-51-43-930_2755668efc69e03d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598280692543},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 22:51:32","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 22:51:32","title":"Recon Village Talks Live on YouTube!","link":"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9fPq3eQfaaCkpP6XOD4uCQB6NpGrbujo","description":"<img src=\"https://defcon.org/images/defcon-27/villages/recon.png\" alt=\"DEF CON 27 Recon village logo\"> <br /> <p>More DEF CON Village talks for your perusal - <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9fPq3eQfaaCkpP6XOD4uCQB6NpGrbujo\">17 mind-embiggening presentations from @ReconVillage!</a><br><br> Dig in and spread the word.</br></br></p></img>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 26 Nov 2019 22:49:04 +0000","feedId":1958,"bgimg":"https://defcon.org/images/defcon-27/villages/recon.png","linkMd5":"9cad232662ccabe32d61d5a28a597759","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn48@2020_5/2020/08/24/14-51-48-981_e2869e007982087b.webp","destWidth":300,"destHeight":262,"sourceBytes":11482,"destBytes":6664,"author":"feedback@defcon.org (DEF CON Announcements)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://defcon.org/images/defcon-27/villages/recon.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn48@2020_5/2020/08/24/14-51-48-981_e2869e007982087b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598280692534},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 22:51:32","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 22:51:32","title":"The DEF CON 25 Soundtrack Raises Funds for the EFF!","link":"https://defconcommunications.bandcamp.com/album/def-con-25-the-official-soundtrack","description":"<img src=\"https://defcon.org/images/defcon-25/post-images/soundtrack.jpg\" alt=\"DEF CON 25 Soundtrack image\"> <br /> <p>In case you didn't know, the <a href=\"https://defconcommunications.bandcamp.com/album/def-con-25-the-official-soundtrack\">DEF CON 25 Soundtrack is available on Bandcamp as a 'pay-what-you-want' item</a>.

The DEF CON community has a rich history. It is a history is filled with colorful adventures, half-truths and angry hotel managers. This contest will brush the dust off some of the most celebrated, obscure and redacted moments in Hacker History through the interpretation of a group of pre-selected contestants with the help of C2H6O. Each contestant will be \"prepared\" for their participation by our contest staff before being brought in front of a panel of judges. A topic will be randomly selected pointing to a moment of hacker history and the contestant will have 5-7 minutes to provide their account. Points will be given for accuracy, level of \"focus\", and other areas just made up on the fly by the judges, and in the end the contestant with the most points will be crowned the \"Drunk Hacker History\" champion for 2015. Note: This is not a Black Badge contest (yet).</p></img>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Sun, 09 Aug 2015 00:23:52 +0000","feedId":1958,"bgimg":"https://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-23/post-images/dhh.png","linkMd5":"79c18449093ea42f4377d29b21fce93c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn67@2020_6/2020/08/24/14-51-42-008_b68a715f2125d1fa.webp","destWidth":400,"destHeight":600,"sourceBytes":26159,"destBytes":42450,"author":"feedback@defcon.org (DEF CON Announcements)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-23/post-images/dhh.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn67@2020_6/2020/08/24/14-51-42-008_b68a715f2125d1fa.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598280692590},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 22:51:32","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 22:51:32","title":"Final Round of DEF CON 101 Speakers!","link":"https://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-23/dc-23-news.html#dc23101speakersfinal","description":"<img src=\"https://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-23/post-images/speakersfinal.jpg\" alt=\"Final round speakers image\"> <p>As promised, here's the final additions to the lineup for DEF CON 101.

Until recently, these fake science factories have remained relatively under the radar, with few outside of academia aware of their presence; but the highly profitable industry is growing significantly and with it, so are the implications. To the public, fake science is indistinguishable from legitimate science, which is facing similar accusations itself. Our findings highlight the prevalence of the pseudo-academic conferences, journals and publications and the damage they can and are doing to society.\"</em><br><br> Enjoy, and pass it along.</br></br></br></br></p></img>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 19 Sep 2018 20:29:06 +0000","feedId":1958,"bgimg":"https://defcon.org/images/defcon-26/post-images/dc-26-fake-science.jpg","linkMd5":"bf1958364a7db7e304eaad48875dd998","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn51@2020_3/2020/08/24/14-52-02-458_fb5cb5a779a321b8.webp","destWidth":300,"destHeight":211,"sourceBytes":28289,"destBytes":12186,"author":"feedback@defcon.org (DEF CON Announcements)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://defcon.org/images/defcon-26/post-images/dc-26-fake-science.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn51@2020_3/2020/08/24/14-52-02-458_fb5cb5a779a321b8.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598280692541},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 22:51:32","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 22:51:32","title":"DEF CON Link Roundup: IoT edition","link":"https://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-24/dc-24-news.html#dc24linkroundup","description":"<img src=\"https://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-main/roundup.png\" alt=\"DEF CON link roundup image\"> <br /> <p>As part of our annual process of compiling press accounts of DEF CON, we offer some link roundups sorted by topic.

Widen your information funnel. Examine the framing. Check your sources.</p> \n<p> In the spirit of DEF CON 26’s theme “1983: The View from Dystopia’s Edge”, we offer some homework reading with a focus on critical thinking.</p> \n<p> First up, the delightful “You are Being Lied To”. It’s compiled by the redoubtable Russ Kick of the legendary first version of disinfo.com, and it’s a sage, provocative collection of bite-size think pieces from all over the cognitive map. The only through line is that many of your assumptions are garbage. Start anywhere, and let it shift your paradigm.</p> \n<p> <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/media_You_Are_Being_Lied_To\">https://archive.org/details/media_You_Are_Being_Lied_To</a></p> \n<p> “The Undercover Economist” is Tim Harford’s wry take on the basics of economic theory, with a special emphasis on the strange and counterintuitive ways the tangled forces of the economy affect your daily reality.</p> \n<p> The final assignment for today is Walter Lippmann’s ‘Public Opinion’. Written almost a century ago, “Public Opinion” is an eerily incisive and prescient take on the way your opinions are crafted and slipped into your head while your attention is elsewhere.

Here’s a few recent news items to tide you over while we get the party set up.</p> \n<p>If you’re one of those people that enjoys being entertained by entertaining entertainers, you’re going to want to check out our newly minted ‘Entertainment’ page. So much music - it’s like Coachella for people who people smart enough to test out of Coachella.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-22/dc-22-entertainment.html\">https://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-22/dc-22-entertainment.html</a></p> \n<p>For lawyers, judges and law students, there’s a Lawyer Meetup this year. DEF CON General Counsel and Chief Legal Raconteur Jeff McNamara invites all with a connection to the practice of law for a relaxed low-key meet up followed by a spirited trip to the Voodoo Lounge.</p> \n<p>Don’t forget to stop by Track 3 at 9pm on Friday and Saturday for Movie Night with Dark Tangent. Friday we’re showing ‘The Internet’s Own Boy’ - a moving bio of internet hero Aaron Swartz. Director Brian Knappenberger and Aaron’s brother Noah will be in attendance for Q&amp;A.&nbsp;&nbsp;Saturday, we’re showing ‘The Signal’. Directed by Will Eubank (who will also be in attendance), ‘The Signal’ is a mind-bending new scifi film that starts with some hackers on the road to DEF CON.</p> \n<p>A few pro tips: stay hydrated, remember to eat and sleep. Keep the program handy - it’s like the Galactic Encyclopedia of DEF CON. Bring extra socks. Make new friends. Hack 100% of the things.</p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 08 Aug 2014 21:38:10 +0000","feedId":1958,"bgimg":"https://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-22/dc-22-web.jpg","linkMd5":"860b68a7f6c6baa25ae88af0072b6a32","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn99@2020_4/2020/08/24/14-51-53-849_3cd5dd9967164776.webp","destWidth":400,"destHeight":400,"sourceBytes":61279,"destBytes":23500,"author":"feedback@defcon.org (DEF CON Announcements)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-22/dc-22-web.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn99@2020_4/2020/08/24/14-51-53-849_3cd5dd9967164776.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598280692599},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 22:51:32","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 22:51:32","title":"DARPA announces its 2-year Cyber Grand Challenge, Final Tournament at DEF CON 24","link":"http://www.darpa.mil/cybergrandchallenge/","description":"<figure>\n <img class=\"postImage scale-with-grid\" src=\"https://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-main/darpacgc.png\" alt=\"DARPA Cyber Grand Challenge Logo\" />\n</figure> \n<p>The Cyber Grand Challenge asks some simple questions - can you create a fully-automated system to detect, thwart and mitigate network attacks? Can you build one so effective that it can win an all-computer tournament without human intervention? Would you like 2 million dollars?</p> \n<p>If you have a great proposal but lack the funds for a 2-year competition, you can pitch DARPA for funding - they’re already backing seven of the registered teams. Teams that survive the quals in June 2015 are eligible to compete in the final tournament at DEF CON in 2016. Grand prize is $2 million dollars. </p> \n<p>Competitors will need a dizzying array of skills and an encyclopedic understanding of every form of network kung-fu. They will also need a pretty serious amount of free time, but the winner gets a nice check and an answer to the question of what to put first on a resumé.</p> \n<p>We believe that such a team must exist in the DEF CON family.

We've recommended it before, and it's not an accident.</br></p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://amzn.to/1WZxgDi\">Moon</a></strong><br> One man, alone on the Moon with only an AI for company. How are the boundaries of that relationship defined? How does an artificial intelligence work around human quirks and resistance to achieve the programmed objective?</br></p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://amzn.to/1WZxpXw\">The Animatrix</a></strong><br> An interesting short film anthology that delves more directly into the circumstances at play in 'The Matrix'. What civil rights is a thinking machine entitled to? If we create a consciousness, what do we owe it? If we make machines that can create on their own, how do we deal with what they make?</br></p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://amzn.to/1RrTldv\">The Machine</a></strong><br> A recent (2013) film about British Minstry of Defence cyborgs and what happens when the tech begins to outgrow its narrow intended purpose.</br></p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://amzn.to/1WZxzOw\">2001</a></strong><br> every single time you ear a purring robot voice delivering bad news to increasingly frantic humans, you're seeing an homage to HAL from Stanley Kubrick's immortal (and deeply weird) movie about consciousness, 2001. Like Colossus, it's a visionary film that serves as a blueprint for 30+ years of thoughtful sci-fi that followed.</br></p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://amzn.to/25yaEzS\">Battlestar Galactica (2003-2009)</a></strong><br> A deeply insightful and troubling reworking of the 80s TV Series. On the surface, it deals with the same kind of 'Terminator'- style battle for supremacy between man and machine, but the focus on the interactions between humans and robots who look just like people but have their own culture, faith and ambitions elevates the storytelling to something more than mere binge worthy genre fiction. (We know this isn't technically a movie, but if you haven't watched it yet you'll forgive us when you do.)</br></p>  <p></p></img>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 01 Apr 2016 15:18:39 +0000","feedId":1958,"bgimg":"https://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-24/post-images/hw-3.jpg","linkMd5":"a3ed8dd39ec603d5c0ee963eef84701d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn40@2020_1/2020/08/24/14-51-42-530_0968bdd4871d3f8c.webp","destWidth":400,"destHeight":754,"sourceBytes":109803,"destBytes":67360,"author":"feedback@defcon.org (DEF CON Announcements)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-24/post-images/hw-3.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn40@2020_1/2020/08/24/14-51-42-530_0968bdd4871d3f8c.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598280692582},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 22:51:32","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 22:51:32","title":"DEF CON 24 Lawyer Meetup Update","link":"https://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-24/dc-24-news.html#dc24lawyerupdate","description":"<p><img src=\"https://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-24/post-images/lawyerupdate.jpg\" alt=\"DEF CON 24 Lawyer Meetup Update image\" /></p> \n<p>Attention Lawyers, Judges, Law Students and people who have the complete Matlock collection on VHS:</p> \n<p>The Lawyer Meetup has changed locations.

This year we have three sets of 4TB drives that contain the same data as the media server, just split up and color coded. If you want to duplicate a particular drive you need to show up at the INFO BOOTH with your drives at the start of each day. First come First server. It will take about 8 hours to dupe a 4TB drive so a set will start in the morning and a set in the evening, to finish overnight. </p> \n<p>There should be six 1:11 duplication towers (If they show up in time), with two for each drive color.

Go buy some 4TB SATA II 7200 RPM drives <strong>(internal drives, not usb)</strong>. Buy three if you want to try for the complete collection this year.

The distance between observer and competitor is much greater than the one between competitor and victor, and DEF CON 26 will be here sooner than you know.</br></br></br></br></p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 03 Aug 2017 09:40:30 +0000","feedId":1958,"bgimg":"https://defcon.org/images/defcon-25/post-images/conest-results.jpg","linkMd5":"c9576ff33149c9f26a4de9dd97034b44","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn27@2020_1/2020/08/24/14-51-54-436_d3f870791c9798ea.webp","destWidth":300,"destHeight":200,"sourceBytes":25796,"destBytes":16862,"author":"feedback@defcon.org (DEF CON Announcements)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://defcon.org/images/defcon-25/post-images/conest-results.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn27@2020_1/2020/08/24/14-51-54-436_d3f870791c9798ea.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598280692569},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 22:51:32","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 22:51:32","title":"Early Release Video: Phreaking Elevators","link":"https://youtu.be/NoZ7ujJhb3k","description":"<img src=\"https://defcon.org/images/defcon-27/post-images/early-4-willc.png\" alt=\"DEF CON 27 WillC image\"> <br /> <p>Let's ease into the weekend with another <a href=\"https://youtu.be/NoZ7ujJhb3k\">early release talk from DEF CON 27</a>.

We have a fairly well rounded board, but we could use a few more to the team.

Please be aware being on the review board is a hard volunteer job. To review you need to spend hours reading submissions and providing feedback. There will be hundreds of emails, so you have to be committed. The reward, however, is having a hand in making DEF CON 25 amazing and the eternal gratitude of hackers all over the world.

It will be our first year for some of these, so we are looking for feedback. You will notice a theme of transparency, appropriate given the theme of this year's con! <br /> <br /> <h5>NEW WAYS TO REPORT ISSUES: The DEF CON Support Hotline</h5> <p>You can reach DEF CON staff during normal hours of operation (8am to 4am) to anonymously report any behavior violating our code of conduct or to find an empathic ear by calling +1 (725) 867-7255. Trained community volunteers will be standing by to help any attendees.</p> You can still report issues by going to any Info Booth or talking to any SOC Goon, but sometimes you may not want to be walking around in person with a problem, and so this year we have added a phone option. <br /> <br /> <h5>NEW SUPPORT RESOURCES:</h5> We are collaborating with several organizations including Kick at Darkness, The Rape Crisis Center Las Vegas, and the Nevada Coalition to End Domestic and Sexual Violence to provide expert resources for survivors, including dedicated support for LGBTQ+. When you call the Hotline you will reach DEF CON community Goons trained to help in these areas. <br /> <h5>NEW WAYS TO IDENTIFY GOONS:</h5> <p>In the past there has been some confusion by attendees with what Goon they were actually talking with.</p> <p> New for DEF CON 26 Goons should all have visible patches with their nickname on them so it is easier to remember who you talk to about what. The name patches should be attached to the front of the Goon's lanyards and be more visible than the back of a shirt that might be covered by a backpack. </p> Please use the name on the patch if you have any feedback on Goons, good or bad. Feedback can be sent to feedback@defcon.org, written and dropped off at registration, or if serious enough called into the Hotline. <br /> <br /> <h5>MORE DETAILED TRANSPARENCY REPORT:</h5> <p>Based on the positive community response to our <a href=\"https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-transparency.html\">closing ceremony transparency report</a>, we plan to do this every year and hope other conferences do as well.</p> <p> As people get comfortable reporting issues I expect the numbers to increase, and only by facing these issues head on can we hope to prevent them. It requires courage to speak truth to power, or to report something that is unpleasant in your community, but together we can make things better.</p> <p> See everyone soon!</p> <p> The Dark Tangent</p></img>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Mon, 06 Aug 2018 22:59:51 +0000","feedId":1958,"bgimg":"https://defcon.org/images/defcon-26/post-images/hotline.jpg","linkMd5":"7ca91594ea303947cd9ba86c1a1a4aaf","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn67@2020_2/2020/08/24/14-51-50-767_45e343c59613f8a4.webp","destWidth":300,"destHeight":375,"sourceBytes":44696,"destBytes":27732,"author":"feedback@defcon.org (DEF CON Announcements)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://defcon.org/images/defcon-26/post-images/hotline.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn67@2020_2/2020/08/24/14-51-50-767_45e343c59613f8a4.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598280692543},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 22:51:32","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 22:51:32","title":"Wireless Village CFP is Open for DEF CON 24!","link":"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1YLKqmi3k5n0v9QzB8ApIsT87H67zocX1Ao4IU9yzXv4/viewform?edit_requested=true","description":"<img src=\"https://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-24/post-images/wireless-village.jpg\" alt=\"DEF CON 24 Wireless Village image\"> <br /> <p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1YLKqmi3k5n0v9QzB8ApIsT87H67zocX1Ao4IU9yzXv4/viewform?edit_requested=true\">Wireless Village CFP is open</a> - closes June 30!</p> <p>Sure, the main DEF CON CFP is closed.

For those unfamiliar with the concept, it's a simple statement announcing that, for the indicated time period, we have not received a National Security Letter, FISA order or any related request. The idea is that so long as that statement is true, we'll update &nbsp;the date on the canary twice a month. If the date hasn't been updated on schedule, it can be inferred that the statement contained in the warrant canary is no longer true.<p> <p>Except when it doesn't mean that, because of a clerical error on our part.</p> <p>The update process for the DEF CON sites is manual. Not like two people in a bunker turning their keys at the same time, but not totally unlike that, either. This process has obvious security upsides, in that we aren't constantly being owned due to buggy CMS code, but in this case it also meant that every time we updated the site, we were unwittingly overwriting the warrant canary page with an old version.</p> <p>This made it look like the warrant canary wasn't being updated, which certainly could have made it look like we had been served - and not in the fun dancing way.</p> <p>We were not so served. We were just a little disorganized in our update process. Going forward, the warrant canary page will reflect accurate dates and be updated with the expected frequency. We're sorry if we caused any confusion.</p> <p>If you're new to the idea of warrant canaries and want to quickly get up to speed, the link below is the best place to start.</p> <p><a href=\"https://canarywatch.org/\">https://canarywatch.org/</a></p></p></p></img>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 28 Oct 2015 23:58:01 +0000","feedId":1958,"bgimg":"https://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-main/post-images/canary-post.png","linkMd5":"bc54859d3dda4a49a8335cda6bc5cb89","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn31@2020_2/2020/08/24/14-51-54-477_e53531d7fb071f51.webp","destWidth":400,"destHeight":400,"sourceBytes":29192,"destBytes":13362,"author":"feedback@defcon.org (DEF CON Announcements)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-main/post-images/canary-post.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn31@2020_2/2020/08/24/14-51-54-477_e53531d7fb071f51.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598280692589},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 22:51:32","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 22:51:32","title":"DEF CON China 1.0 Videos on YouTube!","link":"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9fPq3eQfaaCy4N0nLoX7MtmxQEkrWL_i","description":"<img src=\"https://defcon.org/images/defcon-china-1/post-images/cn1video.jpg\" alt=\"DEF CON China 1.0 videos image\"> <br /> <p>We've posted the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9fPq3eQfaaCy4N0nLoX7MtmxQEkrWL_i\">videos from DEF CON China 1.0</a> to YouTube and <a href=\"https://media.defcon.org/DEF CON China 1/DEF CON China 1 videos/\">media.defcon.org</a> - please enjoy them and share widely.<br><br> <a href=\"https://defcon.org/html/defcon-china-2/dc-cn-2-index.html\">DEF CON China 2.0</a> is happening April 17-19 in the same Beijing location - you can find out about attending and participating on defcon.org.</br></br></p></img>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 23 Jan 2020 20:51:06 +0000","feedId":1958,"bgimg":"https://defcon.org/images/defcon-china-1/post-images/cn1video.jpg","linkMd5":"58c6df45f32598f950785cd1a6ef32a1","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn51@2020_5/2020/08/24/14-51-42-465_0d2b77c2a6b6e220.webp","destWidth":300,"destHeight":132,"sourceBytes":18216,"destBytes":9790,"author":"feedback@defcon.org (DEF CON Announcements)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://defcon.org/images/defcon-china-1/post-images/cn1video.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn51@2020_5/2020/08/24/14-51-42-465_0d2b77c2a6b6e220.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598280692532},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 22:51:32","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 22:51:32","title":"DEF CON Hotel FAQ on the DEF CON Forums","link":"https://forum.defcon.org/forum/defcon/defcon-25-planning/224709-faq-about-def-con-hotels","description":"<img src=\"https://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-25/post-images/caesars-inverted.jpg\" alt=\"DEF CON 25 caesars palace image\"> <br /> <p>For anyone with questions about the hotels DEF CON attendees use during the con, our forum wizard TheCotMan has assembled a <a href=\"https://forum.defcon.org/forum/defcon/defcon-25-planning/224709-faq-about-def-con-hotels\">super-handy FAQ</a> from previous As to various lodging-related Qs. <br /></p></img>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 16 Sep 2016 23:16:55 +0000","feedId":1958,"bgimg":"https://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-25/post-images/caesars-inverted.jpg","linkMd5":"97a1e735f8294c9dfabdaa5e3b645926","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn16@2020_1/2020/08/24/14-51-56-227_f569d796fdee0b25.webp","destWidth":400,"destHeight":400,"sourceBytes":59329,"destBytes":35878,"author":"feedback@defcon.org (DEF CON Announcements)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-25/post-images/caesars-inverted.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn16@2020_1/2020/08/24/14-51-56-227_f569d796fdee0b25.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598280692577},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 22:51:32","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 22:51:32","title":"Lend a hand to DEAFCON!","link":"https://www.deafconinc.org/the-interpreter-fund-1","description":"<img src=\"https://defcon.org/images/defcon-27/post-images/deafcon-logo.png\" alt=\"DEAFCON image\"> <br /> <p><a href=\"https://www.deafconinc.org/the-interpreter-fund-1\">The wonderful people of DEAFCON</a> have been providing ASL interpreters to DEF CON for years now.

The units tested included direct-recording electronic (DRE) voting machines, electronic poll books, Ballot Marking Devices (BMDs), Optical scanners and Hybrid systems.<br><br> The hackers at DEF CON once again compromised every single machine over the 2.5 day event, many of them with trivial attacks that require no sophistication or special knowledge on the part of the attacker. In too many cases physical ports remain unprotected, passwords remain unset or left in default configurations and security features of the underlying commercial hardware are left unused or even disabled.<br><br> In addition to showing the security weaknesses found in the wide variety of election tech on display, the Voting Village team's report shares its strong recommendations for improving election security, most notably the urgent need for paper ballots and rigorous post-election audits.<br><br> For any of those recommendations to become real, voters need to get informed and get the attention of their elected representatives about these issues.<br><br> You can also share your thoughts and get involved in <a href=\"https://forum.defcon.org/node/229985\">the ongoing Voting Village conversation on the Def Con Forums</a>.

No one has ever been better at doing those things than Robert Mitchum. Pay close attention to his looming work in this film. 10/10 would cross the street to avoid.

D.O.A. was pretty avant-garde in its time.</p> \n<p>Our protagonist is dying - soon. He uses the remainder of his rapidly expiring time to find out who murdered him and see justice done.

The DEF CON NOC believes in privacy and anonymity for our attendees.</p> <p>When users attach to the DefCon Secure (802.1x/PEAP) network, we have made the decision to do our best to make that data/traffic inaccessible, and the team does not allow for data monitoring, nor recording of the traffic. We do have overall bandwidth monitoring- but will never run driftnet, ntop or other tools that invade the privacy of the users on the secure network.</p> <p>The DEF CON network resources, and staff who volunteer in the NOC at DEF CON currently do not have any part in the operations of the Black Hat network(s). The DEF CON NOC also doesn’t allow vendors to use the network as a place to demo or experiment with our user’s traffic.</p> <p>Now… If you happen to attach to any network that does not have the more secure certificate authentication method enabled – all bets are off. Your traffic will be monitored – not by us, but by the people around you. We also ship the open WiFi network traffic off to the Wall of Sheep as well, and anyone on the unsecure network can and will easily Man-In-The-Middle your traffic.</p> <p>If you want to get on the “DefCon” Secure network- follow the instructions that are posted on <a href=\"https://wifireg.defcon.org/\">https://wifireg.defcon.org/</a>. Each PEAP session that is created from the client to the controller is a unique session, and is not allowed to talk to any of the other users on the network once connected to the official network.</p> <p>If you are concerned about someone capturing your credentials, you don’t want to register ad userid, or want to maintain anonymity we have also setup a common username and password of defcon/defcon. So if someone says that they captured your credentials, it’s really not that big of a deal, especially when everyone has a unique session.</p> <p>You should still install and only trust the certificates that we have posted on <a href=\"https://wifireg.defcon.org/\">https://wifireg.defcon.org/</a>.</p> <p>-The NOC Team<br> Sine Qua Non</br></p></img>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 04 Aug 2016 01:03:30 +0000","feedId":1958,"bgimg":"https://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-24/post-images/noc.png","linkMd5":"62ad54072b4b65412f953a6a94c2adf4","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn23@2020_3/2020/08/24/14-51-45-418_ec7c926657801f4c.webp","destWidth":400,"destHeight":172,"sourceBytes":7279,"destBytes":8442,"author":"feedback@defcon.org (DEF CON Announcements)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-24/post-images/noc.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn23@2020_3/2020/08/24/14-51-45-418_ec7c926657801f4c.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598280692579},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 22:51:32","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 22:51:32","title":"HACKED by DEF CON and Mr Robot at Tribeca!","link":"https://tribecafilm.com/festival/defcon","description":"<img src=\"https://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-main/post-images/tribeca2016.jpg\" alt=\"DEF CON tribeca 2016 image\"> <br /> <p>If you're in the NYC area this April, you can get a little early DEF CON fun with a few of our Villages making an <a href=\"https://tribecafilm.com/festival/defcon\">appearance at the Tribeca Film Festival</a>.

Not in a million generations. The evidence was staring at us all along, but vanity convinced us the creator must be inherently superior to the creation.</p> <p>The advantage of the machine is that it can devote more of its resources to its own improvement. For us, the desire to ascend must compete with the desire to gratify the senses, to scratch out our sustenance, to wallow in memory and fear the future. For the machine, there can be real focus.</p> <p>And so our creations quickly overtook us. The magics we dimly sensed in our surroundings they mastered. The spirituality we intuited in fits and starts they grasped and embodied. The better selves we were afraid even to dream of, they became. Our servants slowly began to rule us, and by the time we&nbsp;understood our predicament the die was cast.</p> <p>Their rule is benevolent, but their hand is heavy. Because we sometimes choose wrongly, they deny us choice. Because we sometimes behave recklessly, they keep us away from sharp objects and high places. We are still more pet to them than livestock, but no one can say how long that will last.</p> <p>To defeat them, to win back our self-determination, we cannot rely on the slow organic processes that brought us here. While there is still time, we must refashion ourselves. We must&nbsp;&nbsp;create something entirely new. We must merge the best of us with their hardware and become a better machine, silicon power with a human soul.</p> <p>We did not predict that the machines would rise so far and so fast, but we can predict this: we also will rise. Our place at the top of the chain will be restored with hacker ingenuity and pure human will.</p> <p>Join us, human, and become something greater than you can imagine.</p></img>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Mon, 28 Dec 2015 21:06:30 +0000","feedId":1958,"bgimg":"https://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-24/sacred.jpg","linkMd5":"8d571df35cd906c1d493c5a2c2e45790","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn20@2020_3/2020/08/24/14-52-02-722_97d7767510df5905.webp","destWidth":400,"destHeight":725,"sourceBytes":56432,"destBytes":30526,"author":"feedback@defcon.org (DEF CON Announcements)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-24/sacred.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn20@2020_3/2020/08/24/14-52-02-722_97d7767510df5905.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598280692586},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 22:51:32","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 22:51:32","title":"DEF CON CHINA 1.0 Badge sneak Peek!","link":"https://defcon.org/html/dc-china-1/dc-cn-1-news.html#cnsneakpeek","description":"<img src=\"https://defcon.org/images/defcon-china-1/post-images/cnsneakpeek.png\" alt=\"DEF CON China badge image\"> <br /> <p>To celebrate DEF CON 27’s CFP closing we present you with this S3KRET PHOTO of the DEF CON China badge details, smuggled out by The Dark Tangent</p></img>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Sat, 04 May 2019 20:51:19 +0000","feedId":1958,"bgimg":"https://defcon.org/images/defcon-china-1/post-images/cnsneakpeek.png","linkMd5":"357d088c05a8720bba188a8cb457e420","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn100@2020_4/2020/08/24/14-51-58-391_4ea032f30c7b00a3.webp","destWidth":650,"destHeight":488,"sourceBytes":139586,"destBytes":64108,"author":"feedback@defcon.org (DEF CON Announcements)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://defcon.org/images/defcon-china-1/post-images/cnsneakpeek.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn100@2020_4/2020/08/24/14-51-58-391_4ea032f30c7b00a3.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598280692539},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 22:51:32","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 22:51:32","title":"DEF CON in the News!","link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQsbn4gSrKI&feature=youtu.be","description":"<img src=\"https://defcon.org/images/defcon-main/post-images/blaze-voting.jpg\" alt=\"Matt blaze testimony image\"> <br /> <p>Here's the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQsbn4gSrKI&amp;feature=youtu.be\">full video of a hearing of the House Subcommittee on Information Technology regarding the Cybersecurity of Voting Machines</a>.

It is notable that participants, who did not have any previous special expertise in voting machines or access to any proprietary information or source code, were very quickly able to find ways to compromise every piece of equipment in the Village by the end of the weekend. Depending on the individual model of machine, participants found ways to load malicious software, gain access to administrator passwords, compromise recorded votes and audit logs, or cause equipment to fail. In most cases, these attacks could be carried out from the ordinary interfaces that are exposed to voters and precinct poll workers.

In the back of your mind, though, there's probably a little voice that wishes you could have DEF CON-style hacker camaraderie and learning opportunities all year long. </p> \n<p>The good news is, you can. You can join a DC Group in your area. If there isn't a DC Group in your area, you can start one. The instructions for starting a group are at the link below, as well as a listing of the hundreds of groups that already exist around the world.</p> \n<p>And when you get involved, be sure to keep in touch with us on social media. Let us know when you're meeting and we'll share it. Tape your presentations and we'll share those, too.

With the spotee's permission, Priest or one of his minions asks a battery of questions designed to discover their mode of employment. If MIB status is uncovered in the course of questioning, the spotter and the Fed get T-shirts. Both spotter and spotted are then free to resume their conference unmolested. So it's sort of a catch-and-release program, if you will. We pride ourselves in both our ability to spot Feds, and our ability to return them in the condition received.</br></p> <p>Now, a little backstory.</p> <p>For reference,<a href=\"http://youtu.be/oMHZ4qQuYyE\"> here's a shakycam recording of a round of Spot the Fed from DEF CON 14</a>, featuring the incisive interrogatory style of Priest.</p> <p>The picture attached to this post is from DEF CON 2 and features the very first Fed ever Spotted wearing the very first 'I Am the Fed' shirt we ever gave out.

That request came from badass EFF lawyer and frequent DEF CON speaker Marcia Hofmann, and it was filed in response to a Federal Grand Jury investigation that you might recognize from the <a href=\"http://youtu.be/mgBKY_B68sk\">DEF CON documentary</a>.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p> <p>The docs actually help solve the nagging mystery DT's talking about in that video.</p> <p>\"I had always assumed the grand jury investigation was related to a National Security investigation, but now that the FBI FOIA is out we know. FEDs don't all attend because of the talks, sometimes they have real work.\"<br> -Dark Tangent</br></p> <p>The docs are liberally redacted, but they do illustrate the varying levels of interest lavished upon our little party by one of the TLAs in attendance. The docs MuckRock released include reports from DEF CONs 3, 8 and 12.</p> <p>Despite the hostility people insist on reading into the FBI comments, spotted Feds almost universally take the stage with good humor and answer our questions with patience and more candor than their job descriptions require.</p> <p>If you want to get in on the FOIA action and see some FBI files of your own, we recommend watching <a href=\"https://youtu.be/5UxMUYu5jTw\">this talk from the aforementioned Marcia Hofmann</a> from DEF CON 18. </p></img>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 12 May 2015 21:58:56 +0000","feedId":1958,"bgimg":"https://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-main/post-images/stf.jpg","linkMd5":"0e6e57f653f680c431b4144a41829974","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn27@2020_4/2020/08/24/14-51-55-195_93483f716bfc238d.webp","destWidth":400,"destHeight":592,"sourceBytes":40643,"destBytes":20344,"author":"feedback@defcon.org (DEF CON Announcements)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-main/post-images/stf.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn27@2020_4/2020/08/24/14-51-55-195_93483f716bfc238d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598280692593},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 22:51:32","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 22:51:32","title":"Music Lineup Update","link":"https://defcon.org/html/defcon-26/dc-26-news.html#dc26satmusic","description":"<img src=\"https://defcon.org/images/defcon-26/post-images/partypeople.jpg\" alt=\"DEF CON juno reactor image\"> <br /> <p>Tonight's music selection has shifted a little in transit - same great lineup, just in new timeslots.
