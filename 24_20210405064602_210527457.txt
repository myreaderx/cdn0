This entry recommends movies to watch next if you like Godzilla vs Kong.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>If all you know of kaiju movies is what you&#8217;ve seen in Legendary&#8217;s <em><strong>MonsterVerse</strong></em> franchise, then you obviously owe it to yourself to watch the old <strong>Toho</strong> <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/godzilla-legacy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em><strong>Godzilla</strong></em></a> films (pick up <a href=\"https://www.criterion.com/boxsets/2648-godzilla-the-showa-era-films-1954-1975\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Criterion Collection&#8217;s Show-era box set</a> for starters) as well as the original 1933 <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/we-cant-escape-king-kong/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em><strong>King Kong</strong></em></a> (plus the 1976 and 2005 remakes for their respective charms). We highlighted some relevant classics in our Movie DNA for the previous <em>MonsterVerse </em>installment, <em><strong><a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/movies-like-godzilla-king-of-the-monsters/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Godzilla: King of the Monsters</a></strong></em>, and a few years ago we listed a whopping thirty-seven giant monster movie titles in <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/big-monster-movies/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">our must-read kaiju primer</a>. Add the whole lot to your watchlist.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not going to take up too much of this edition of Movie DNA to highlight all of the essentials or referenced installments (Matthew Chernov has compiled a nice <a href=\"https://variety.com/2021/film/news/godzilla-vs-kong-easter-eggs-hidden-references-1234942012/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">list of Toho easter eggs for Variety</a>) connected to the new <em>MonsterVerse </em>crossover sequel <em><strong>Godzilla vs. Kong</strong></em>, and I tend to let remakes speak for themselves so I&#8217;ll just mention 1962&#8217;s <em><strong>King Kong vs. Godzilla</strong></em> here and leave it as a given. I&#8217;m also skipping over recommendations of director <strong>Adam Wingard</strong>&#8216;s filmography, though you should definitely see <em><strong>You&#8217;re Next</strong></em> (2011) and <em><strong>The Guest</strong></em> (2014) when you get the chance.</p>\n<p>What we&#8217;re left with below is still an oversized list of fourteen features and one short I find most interesting to discuss and recommend after watching <em>Godzilla vs. Kong</em>. Some are acknowledged influences on the new movie or otherwise directly related titles as confirmed in interviews. The rest include historical precedents &#8212; inside and outside of the franchise &#8212; going back nearly a century, plus some personal favorites I was reminded of during my viewing. As is often the case, you&#8217;ll find even more suggested and pertinent movies (and a couple of television programs) that you may also want to check out for context.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Pacific Rim: Uprising (2018)</h2>\n<p>The year before Legendary kicked off the <em>MonsterVerse</em> franchise with Gareth Edwards&#8217; <em>Godzilla</em>, Guillermo del Toro brought kaiju back to Hollywood in a big way with the mecha vs. monster movie <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/mythic-magnificence-pacific-rim/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em><strong>Pacific Rim</strong></em></a>. Well, it wasn&#8217;t quite as big as hoped-for in the US, but it was enough of an international hit to spawn this sequel. Why am I recommending part two (which shares its editor, Josh Schaeffer, with <em>Godzilla vs. Kong</em>) instead of part one? Well, I actually like it better (our publisher thinks I&#8217;m crazy for that), plus the original is in that kaiju movie list I link to above.</p>\n<p>Also, back in 2017, <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/watch-these-movies-and-shows-before-you-see-pacific-rim-uprising/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em><strong>Pacific Rim: Uprising</strong></em></a> co-writer/director <strong>Steven S. DeKnight</strong> <a href=\"https://collider.com/pacific-rim-godzilla-king-kong-crossover-monsters-universe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">told Collider</a> that there&#8217;d been talk (by whom, it&#8217;s unclear) of a <em>MonsterVerse</em> crossover:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“I won’t say there’s an Easter Egg but there’s been a lot of discussion about that possibility [of crossing over]. Look I think it would be fantastic to have the &#8216;Pacific Rim&#8217; universe join Legendary’s Monster Universe, it seems like a natural step. And part of the big overall plan after the third movie we’ve talked about is that could happen, it’s always a possibility. It’s by far not a certainty; it’s merely theoretical at this point, but as a fan myself I would love to see that happen.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>Earlier this year, del Toro <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RealGDT/status/1353890122752782338\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">admitted on Twitter</a> he&#8217;d love to see it happen, as a fan. A month later, DeKnight claimed on social media that he saw it as more than just a theoretical, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stevendeknight/status/1359651243094798338\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">tweeting in reply to an inquiry</a>: &#8220;That was actually my long-term plan. [<em>Pacific Rim 3</em>] was structured to end in a way that married the two universes.&#8221; Then <em>Godzilla vs. Kong</em> (and regular <em>MonsterVerse</em>) screenwriter <strong>Max Borenstein</strong> <a href=\"https://wegotthiscovered.com/movies/exclusive-interview-writer-max-borenstein-talks-godzilla-kong-monsterverse/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">told We Got This Covered</a>, &#8220;I saw what [DeKnight] said, and I think if he has the vision for it, that would be dope. You know, he’s a really talented storyteller so I would certainly be eager to see it.&#8221;</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Eight Legged Freaks (2002)</h2>\n<p>Conspiracy theorist characters go hand in hand with disaster movies and monster movies. But Brian Tyree Henry&#8217;s podcaster Bernie Hayes in <em>Godzilla vs. Kong</em> made me recall one in particular: Doug E. Doug&#8217;s <strong><em>Eight Legged Freaks</em></strong> character, Harlan Griffith, who spouts alien-abduction theories from a pirate radio station that he operates from his trailer home before becoming mixed up in the movie&#8217;s plot. However, unlike Hayes&#8217; claims, Griffith&#8217;s are not validated since the giant spiders in <em>Eight Legged Freaks</em> are not extraterrestrial in origin. Anyway, this is an underrated large-monster movie I&#8217;m happy to include for any reason.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Beyond the Mat (1999)</h2>\n<p><em>Eight Legged Freaks</em> co-star David Arquette, who has had a controversial side career as a professional wrestler, would appreciate this high-profile documentary bumping up against the above selection. The Ron Howard and Brian Grazer-produced <em><strong>Beyond the Mat</strong></em> is a fascinating look at pro wrestling and probably was the first time I viewed the entertainment seriously as an adult (my childhood enjoyment of <em>Hulk Hogan&#8217;s Rock &#8216;n&#8217; Wrestling</em> doesn&#8217;t count). And one of its featured subjects, Mick Foley, then known as Mankind, is namechecked by Adam Wingard in <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/godzilla-vs-kong-adam-wingard-interview/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">our interview with the director</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“I always saw Godzilla as the heel of the movie. He’s Undertaker, and Kong is Mankind Mick Foley. Whenever you have that sort of opposition, the heel has to be more mysterious. He’s blowing stuff up, and there are obviously characters trying to figure out why that is. But at the end of the day, that creates this protagonist kind of thing with Kong.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>If you&#8217;re not familiar with the wrestlers that Wingard references, you can see them fight in the most memorable sequence of <em>Beyond the Mat</em>. The director&#8217;s analogy isn&#8217;t too outrageous &#8212; many reviews of <em>Godzilla vs. Kong</em> also compare it to wrestling &#8212; considering film and cultural historians equate the first kaiju-vs-kaiju movies with the rise of pro wrestling in Japan in the 1950s. Also, the notorious international match between Japan&#8217;s Rikidôzan, Toyonobori, and Great Togo and America&#8217;s &#8220;Classy&#8221; Freddie Blassie, Lou Thesz, and Mike Sharpe in April 1962 and the event&#8217;s controversial (and allegedly lethal) TV broadcast as was a likely influence on the plot and the satirical themes of <em>King Kong vs. Godzilla</em>, released later that same year.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Romeo + Juliet (1996)</h2>\n<p>No, this isn&#8217;t recommended because I saw some implication that Godzilla and Kong had some sexual tension between them or anything, but it would have been funny if one of the human characters who were Team Godzilla and one of the characters who were Team Kong would have started dating only for that drama to exacerbate the rift between the two Titans. Actually, no, the less the humans have to do, the better. In fact, my including Baz Luhrman&#8217;s adaptation of the William Shakespeare tragedy is just to acknowledge that fact by pointing out that there almost was more to the human characters than what made it on screen.</p>\n<p>According to <em>Godzilla vs. Kong</em> co-stars <strong>Millie Bobby Brown</strong> and <strong>Julian Dennison</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.joblo.com/movie-news/set-visit-millie-bobby-brown-brian-tyree-henry-more-on-godzilla-vs-kong\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">via JoBlo.com</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>MBB: But the script was supposed to be that we [Madison and Josh] were in a relationship…</p>\n<p>JD: Our first screentest together we have to recite some &#8220;Romeo and Juliet” lines…</p>\n<p>MBB: Oh my god.</p>\n<p>JD: It was so bad.</p>\n<p>MBB: It was so bad. But [by the end] we weren’t even doing the script, it was just me and him laughing. We were laughing and talking. And then I remember they left and they were like, “So, Millie, do you like him?” And was like, “Uhhh do I like him? He’s like an angel. Yes. Tell him he has the job, like, right now.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>Now that I&#8217;ve got that out of the way, I can reveal that the real movie for this spot is the other modern-day update of <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> released in 1996: <em><strong>Tromeo and Juliet</strong></em>. It&#8217;s so loose with the source material and involves so many more laughs that maybe that&#8217;s what Brown and Dennison&#8217;s reading was closer to. Also, one of the main characters turns into a monster, so that fits, too. But maybe I should have gone with a different twist on classic literature by recommending <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/movies-to-watch-enola-holmes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em><strong>Enola Holmes</strong></em></a> (2020), which is a more enjoyable movie than <em>Godzilla vs. Kong</em> with Brown and a couple of dudes on an investigative adventure.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/movies-to-watch-godzilla-vs-kong/2/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-361222\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/next-page.jpg\" alt=\"Next Page\" width=\"364\" height=\"99\" /></a></p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/J2Rza8djGuY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 04 Apr 2021 01:16:38 +0000","feedId":24,"bgimg":"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/next-page.jpg","linkMd5":"0dcd90eadd6bb31d3b5fcdf966deacec","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn7@2020_2/2021/04/05/06-45-16-812_2c5bdadceaa70996.webp","destWidth":364,"destHeight":99,"sourceBytes":4953,"destBytes":4110,"author":"Christopher Campbell","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/next-page.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn7@2020_2/2021/04/05/06-45-16-812_2c5bdadceaa70996.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/J2Rza8djGuY":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn30@2020_2/2021/04/05/06-45-30-507_1b8039309dc55d99.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617605100517},{"createdTime":"2021-04-05 14:45:00","updatedTime":"2021-04-05 14:45:00","title":"Martin Scorsese Just Wants to Hang Out with His Friends","link":"https://filmschoolrejects.com/?p=364522","description":"<p>In the sixth episode of <em><strong>Pretend It’s a City</strong></em>, <strong>Martin Scorsese</strong>&#8216;s new Netflix docuseries starring himself and <strong>Fran Lebowitz</strong>, the filmmaker and the author are asked a simple question: How did you meet?</p>\n<p>While neither is quite sure, the legend goes that the two always found themselves in conversation at the kind of parties that icons of New York attend. So, they became friends. Lebowitz recounts the origins of their friendship like the banal anecdote it used to be. But now, a year into a pandemic, the thought of meeting anyone anywhere is enough to make their friendship seem like a fairytale. And perhaps it is: how many friendships get such a public display?</p>\n<p>Before <em>Pretend It’s a City, </em>there was <strong><em>Public Speaking</em>,</strong> the 2010 feature documentary Scorsese made for HBO about Lebowitz. If it’s useful to compare one work to the other, the original, as is often the case, is better than the remake: tighter, funnier, and more original in form. <em>Public Speaking</em>, <a href=\"https://nonfics.com/martin-scorsese-public-speaking/\">I’ve argued</a>, should be considered among Scorsese’s best work.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-364553\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/publicspeaking.jpeg\" alt=\"Publicspeaking\" width=\"700\" height=\"500\" /></p>\n<p>But there is at least one thing about <em>Pretend It’s a City</em>, apart from the format, that marks a notable departure from <em>Public Speaking</em>, something that makes clear that while the new project is similar to its predecessor, it is, in fact, something new. Of course, this is true of all of Scorsese’s work (despite the claim by Twitter trolls complaining that he only makes mafia movies).</p>\n<p>In <em>Public Speaking, </em>Scorsese appears at the beginning of the film to plant a kiss on Lebowitz’s cheek as she arrives at the Waverly Inn. Scorsese then takes his seat on the edge of the frame, where he asks questions, sometimes responds to her answers, and laughs so deeply and bodily one fears he might roll over at any moment.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-364545\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pretend-Its-A-City.jpg\" alt=\"Pretend Its A City Fran Lebowitz Martin Scorsese friends\" width=\"800\" height=\"418\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pretend-Its-A-City.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pretend-Its-A-City-768x401.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p>That laugh is also on full display in <em>Pretend It’s a City</em>, and it’s there where one finds the key difference between the two works: the man himself. With <em>Public Speaking</em>, Scorsese directs a portrait of a friend. In <em>Pretend It’s a City</em>, he documents a friendship, joining Lebowitz on stage in conversation throughout the series and, at one point, in the halls of the New York Public Library. Who could blame him? Martin Scorsese is like us. He just wants to hang out with his friends.</p>\n<p>It is this contemplation of friendship that one feels in much of Scorsese’s recent work. Yes, this is somewhat obvious. In <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/the-irishman-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em><strong>The Irishman</strong></em></a>, Scorsese not only reunites with some of his closest friends and collaborators but also directs a scene in which one friend (<strong>Joe Pesci</strong> as Russell) asks another (<strong>Robert De Niro</strong> as Frank) to kill a third (<strong>Al Pacino</strong> as Jimmy Hoffa).</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-358364\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/the-irishman.jpg\" alt=\"The Irishman\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/the-irishman.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/the-irishman-320x240.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p>Rather, Scorsese’s appearance in <em>Pretend It’s a City </em>had me thinking about smaller moments in his films that gesture toward his understanding of friendship. If we return again to <em>The Irishman</em> and look beyond Pesci, De Niro, and <strong>Harvey Keitel</strong>, we find another friend who, in the film, is a character but was once very much real: the comedian <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/don-rickles-aarp-interview-series-36ae459d3885/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Don Rickles</strong></a>, portrayed by Jim Norton.</p>\n<p>Devotees of the film and the comic will know that the real Rickles played casino manager Bill Sherbert in Scorsese&#8217;s<em> <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/movies-to-watch-casino/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Casino </strong></a></em>(1995), a fine but mostly unmemorable performance, except perhaps when Joe Pesci beats him over the head with a telephone in pursuit of his winnings. In <em>One Night Only, </em>a 2014 TV special in tribute to Rickles, Scorsese explains the casting decision: “[Las Vegas] was a character in that movie and Don, you were the link to that town. You gave it authenticity. You gave it a sense of danger,” he says, before roasting Rickles. “At least that was the theory anyway.”</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-347976\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/casino-rickles.jpg\" alt=\"Casino Rickles\" width=\"700\" height=\"500\" /></p>\n<p>True or not, the inclusion of Rickles, who performed in Las Vegas from the days of the Rat Pack until his death in 2017 at the age of ninety, lends a certain authenticity to the image. One of <em>Casino</em>’s strengths is its way of blending fiction with fact, like when De Niro as Ace describes how to surveil the casino floor. Or the implications of a hole in the desert. When the aging Rickles is on-screen in <em>Casino, </em>we see before us not just Don Rickles as “Billy Sherbert,” but the personification of Las Vegas and its history.</p>\n<p>Norton as Rickles is on screen for, by my count, less than a minute in <em>The Irishman. </em>His performance at the Copacabana provides a backdrop to a conversation between Frank and Russell about “Crazy” Joe Gallo,&#8221; who they believe ordered the shooting of Italian American Civil Rights League leaders. Rickles makes fun of everybody &#8212; except, well, “those Italians,” he says, pointing at Gallo and the other mobsters in the audience. Everybody laughs. Just as the real Rickles embodied the real Las Vegas, the fictional Rickles invites us to imagine what it might have been like to be there, at the Copacabana in its heyday.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-364552\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Jim-Norton-in-The-Irishman.jpeg\" alt=\"Jim Norton In The Irishman\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Jim-Norton-in-The-Irishman.jpeg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Jim-Norton-in-The-Irishman-768x384.jpeg 768w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Jim-Norton-in-The-Irishman-710x355.jpeg 710w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p>At the end of the set, Joey walks up to Russ and says of the Italian American Civil Rights League pin on his lapel, “You really believe in that bullshit league?” Frank stands up at the sign of disrespect and moves Joey away from Russ. Frank tells Joey he can’t say things like that. “Why not,” Joey asks, “Rickles is the only one who can make jokes?” Yes. He is. So much of <em>The Irishman </em>is about hierarchy: who can say and do what to who and when. The hierarchy is what compels Frank to defend Russ at th<span style=\"font-size: 15.9999px;\">at </span><span style=\"font-size: 1.14285rem;\">moment, and it&#8217;s why he shoots Jimmy in the back of the head later on.</span></p>\n<p>While the inclusion of Rickles makes thematic and historical sense &#8212; Scorsese <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N80s8hBLaJM\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">told talk show host Jimmy Kimmel</a> that the jokes were taken from first-person accounts of Rickles’s act that night &#8212; Scorsese did not <em>have</em> to include his friend Rickles. But, as Scorsese said in that same interview with Kimmel, “We had to get Don in the film. We had to get him in.” It is as if by writing Rickles into the film, Scorsese was looking to hang out with his friend one last time.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the most famous line on friendship in Scorsese’s work comes in <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/goodfellas-power-kinetic-cinema/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><em>Goodfellas</em></strong></a> (1990), just after young Henry Hill gets “pinched” for the first time. Jimmy (De Niro) turns to Henry after the charges are dismissed and tells him he has just learned two things: “Never rat on your friends, and always keep your mouth shut.”</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-357340\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Goodfellas-Ray-Liotta-Robert-De-Niro-759x500-1.jpg\" alt=\"Goodfellas voice-over Ray Liotta Robert De Niro X\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Goodfellas-Ray-Liotta-Robert-De-Niro-759x500-1.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Goodfellas-Ray-Liotta-Robert-De-Niro-759x500-1-320x240.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p>In FSR’s <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/best-movies-of-the-decade-2010s/8/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">list of the best films of the 2010s</a>, I wrote about <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/movies-to-watch-wolf-of-wall-street/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><em>The Wolf of Wall Street </em></strong></a>(2013) and the obvious parallels between <strong>Ray Liotta</strong>’s Henry Hill and <strong>Leonardo DiCaprio</strong>’s Jordan Belfort. Both enter chaotic, seemingly lawless worlds as outsiders then make it, get consumed by it, and finally come crashing down by way of the usual vices (sex, drugs, money) and law enforcement.</p>\n<p>At the end of <em>Goodfellas, </em>Henry turns on his aging friends and sends them to prison. He opens his mouth. But in <em>The Wolf of Wall Street</em>, Jordan, under the pressure of law enforcement doesn’t rat on his friends. When he visits Donnie (<strong>Jonah Hill</strong>) at the offices of Stratton Oakmont, he writes him a note: “Don’t incriminate yourself. I’m wearing a wire.”</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-364551\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/wolf.jpg\" alt=\"Wolf of Wall Street\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/wolf.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/wolf-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p>The next day, Jordan wakes up to a house full of FBI agents. One of them holds up the note and then takes Jordan to jail. A gesture of friendship leads to Jordan’s arrest, the arrest of his friends, and the end of Stratton Oakmont. Was it stupid? Perhaps. But they were all going down anyway. And unlike Henry Hill, who lost everything, Jordan Belfort at least kept his friends.</p>\n<p>It’s possible that my search for friendship in Scorsese’s recent work is merely an indication of what I miss most about pre-pandemic life. But I think the message is there: keep your friends close, and hang out with them whenever you can.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/DMLwpafuh0k\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 04 Apr 2021 13:16:18 +0000","feedId":24,"bgimg":"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/publicspeaking.jpeg","linkMd5":"dd1e9ef920e62fd0d488b6a2a4f40ffc","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn3@2020_1/2021/04/05/06-45-29-372_449a5b26b4e94363.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":500,"sourceBytes":27845,"destBytes":25220,"author":"Will DiGravio","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/publicspeaking.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn3@2020_1/2021/04/05/06-45-29-372_449a5b26b4e94363.webp","https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pretend-Its-A-City.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn32@2020_2/2021/04/05/06-45-30-631_88f67d1913250719.webp","https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/the-irishman.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn23@2020_1/2021/04/05/06-45-30-634_4c230bec7d90bc09.webp","https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/casino-rickles.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn44@2020_1/2021/04/05/06-45-59-628_def26c8b4493cc7c.webp","https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Jim-Norton-in-The-Irishman.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn49@2020_2/2021/04/05/06-45-30-619_79bbb9e49b9c765f.webp","https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Goodfellas-Ray-Liotta-Robert-De-Niro-759x500-1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn33@2020_1/2021/04/05/06-45-30-853_1988f2fd40579dd8.webp","https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/wolf.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn19@2020_4/2021/04/05/06-45-30-712_7e652d64f1dd99f4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/DMLwpafuh0k":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn17@2020_1/2021/04/05/06-45-42-772_22e748b466a219b9.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617605100517},{"createdTime":"2021-04-05 14:45:00","updatedTime":"2021-04-05 14:45:00","title":"The 10 Best Moments from Genndy Tartakovsky’s ‘Clone Wars’","link":"https://filmschoolrejects.com/?p=364504","description":"<p><em>Welcome to <strong><a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/topics/saturday-morning-cartoons\">Saturday Morning Cartoons</a></strong>, our weekly column where we continue the animated boob tube ritual of yesteryear. Our lives may no longer be scheduled around small screen programming, but that doesn’t mean we should forget the necessary sanctuary of Saturday ‘toons. In this entry,&nbsp;</em><em>we celebrate the Genndy Tartakovsky Clone Wars series just in time for its Disney+ relaunch.</em></p> \n<hr /> \n<p>While in the midst of crafting his prequels, George Lucas let his <strong><em>Star Wars</em> </strong>stranglehold slip for a moment. The toy sales between <em>The Phantom Menace</em> and <em>Attack of the Clones</em> were not as strong as possible. He, <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/collecting-star-wars-action-figures-new-dope/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">and Hasbro</a>, did not want that trend to continue during the empty years between <em>Attack of the Clones</em> and <em>Revenge of the Sith</em>. Lucas couldn’t allow his action figures to stagnate, and to prevent that, he needed new stories flowing ’round the clock. He turned to <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/primal/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Genndy Tartakovsky</strong></a>.</p> \n<p>In the early aughts, Tartakovsky already had quite the reputation. With <em>Dexter</em>‘s <em>Laboratory</em>, <em>The Powerpuff Girls</em>, and <em>Samurai Jack</em>, the animator cornered the market on peculiar ideas and action. On the surface, he did not seem like a perfect match for Lucas, but their collaboration would result in <em>Star Wars</em>‘ freshest spin in decades, and it would establish a massive new playground for <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/topics/the-clone-wars-explained/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">other animators to eventually run wild</a>.</p> \n<p>While Genndy Tartakovsky’s <strong><em>Star Wars: Clone Wars</em></strong> would eventually get de-canonized by Lucasfilm, its three seasons remain some of the most vibrant <em>Star Wars</em> entertainment out there. With its <a href=\"https://www.disneyplus.com/series/star-wars-vintage-clone-wars-2d-micro-series/7UHqaxQ62pSx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">arrival on Disney+</a> this month, we wanted to highlight the moments that made this experiment so damn special. Tartakovsky’s <em>Clone Wars&nbsp;</em>is an exhilaratingly hyper watch, operating in short bursts designed to make the most impact. No second is wasted. Good luck catching your breath.</p> \n<p>Originally, <em>Clone Wars</em> was released via chapters, most of which lasted little more than three minutes. When the series came to DVD, they packaged the first two seasons as one disc and the third season as another. Disney+ has chosen to replicate the physical media format, presenting the stories as two volumes to view. As such, I chose not to select the best episodes or chapters from the series but the best moments.</p> \n<hr /> \n<h2>10. Yoda Lays It Down</h2> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-364512 size-full\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/The-Clone-Wars-Yoda.jpg\" alt=\"Star Wars: Clone Wars Yoda\" width=\"800\" height=\"437\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/The-Clone-Wars-Yoda.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/The-Clone-Wars-Yoda-768x420.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p> \n<p>We gotta start at the beginning. The first shot of “Chapter 1” is taken from a long distance. We see a tiny Yoda silhouette riding atop an armored Kybuck. As he charges into battle, he raises his green lightsaber, and the John Williams-like score roars to life. Yoda lays it all down for the viewer, “Like fire across the galaxy, the Clone Wars spread.”</p> \n<p>The storytelling economy is incredible. Within a few frames, Tartakovsky establishes <em>Clone Wars</em>‘ terrifying significance. The Separatists are on the verge of dismantling the Republic: planets are crumbling, democracies leaving with them. Anakin Skywalker’s secret love affair takes a backburner to a viral fear. Obi-Wan Kenobi has prepared his whole life for this moment. The battlefield is their new home.</p> \n<p>While the fanbase took a few lines from <em>A New Hope</em> and transformed them into an epic, George Lucas never intended to wallow in the warfare. You know he hated straying too far from the Skywalkers. Tartakovsky was the first creative given the space to celebrate what the fandom always imagined. In “Chapter 1” of&nbsp;<em>Clone Wars</em>, Tartakovsky reveals his understanding of what we want: to drill into every nook and cranny.</p> \n<hr /> \n<h2>9. Maul Ain’t Missed</h2> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-364513 size-full\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/The-Clone-Wars-Sith.jpg\" alt=\"Sith\" width=\"800\" height=\"445\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/The-Clone-Wars-Sith.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/The-Clone-Wars-Sith-768x427.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p> \n<p>As rad as Christopher Lee was, his Count Dooku could not match <a href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Maul\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Darth Maul’s striking figure</a>. For <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/the-phantom-greatness-of-star-wars-episode-iii-revenge-of-the-sith-a0bde775412f/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Revenge of the Sith</em></a>, Lucas worked hard on his replacement, General Grievous, and Tartakovsky was tasked with the unveiling of that nasty creation in <em>Clone Wars</em> (more on that asthmatic in a moment). However, Tartakovsky may have even upped the main big bad with a throwaway side villain: Asajj Ventress.</p> \n<p>When it comes to&nbsp;<em>Star Wars</em> thugs, Sith always rolls downhill. Darth Sidious barks orders at Dooku, and Dooku returns the favor on Ventress. Not that he welcomed her with open arms. She came to him looking for a job, and only after they square-off violently in “Chapter 7” does he bother to give her the time of day. During that climax, the deadly duel-blading assassin gets her first assignment from Darth Sidious, and she takes to it with gusto. Ventress <a href=\"https://www.starwars.com/databank/asajj-ventress\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">would go on to be a critical character</a> throughout <em>The Clone Wars</em>‘ next iteration, but she was badass from minute one.</p> \n<hr /> \n<h2>8. A Mechanical Nightmare</h2> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-364514 size-full\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/The-Clone-Wars-General-.jpg\" alt=\"Genndy Tartakovsky Clone Wars General Grievous\" width=\"800\" height=\"447\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/The-Clone-Wars-General-.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/The-Clone-Wars-General--768x429.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p> \n<p>“Chapter 20” marks a major turning point in Genndy Tartakovsky’s <em>Clone Wars</em>. The Republic wins a mighty skirmish against the Separatists, but a new threat emerges with every victory. Master <a href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Ki-Adi-Mundi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ki-Adi-Mundi</a> and a small squad of Jedi clash against the new droid commander, General Grievous, and their superiority comes immediately into question. These Knights are fierce, but they fall quickly, and they don’t stand up. <em>Clone Wars</em> plays for keeps.</p> \n<p>As seen in the films, Grievous is a wheezing, lumbering hulk with furious outbursts. As introduced in “Chapter 20,” Grievous is a mechanical nightmare. The robo-general bounces at his prey like a cat, playing with their desperation before cutting them in half. Ki-Adi-Mundi holds his own, but barely. The Knights around him fall hard and mostly in pieces. <em>Clone Wars</em>‘ Grievous is as close to a slasher film killer as <em>Star Wars</em> is willing to get. “<a href=\"https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/562144/friday-the-13th-jason-voorhees-whisper-sound-effect-story\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ki ki ki ma ma ma…</a>”</p> \n<hr /> \n<h2>7. Brave New Worlds</h2> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-364515 size-full\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Genndy-Tartakovskys-The-Clone-Wars-Kit-Fisto.jpg\" alt=\"Kit Fisto\" width=\"800\" height=\"447\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Genndy-Tartakovskys-The-Clone-Wars-Kit-Fisto.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Genndy-Tartakovskys-The-Clone-Wars-Kit-Fisto-768x429.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p> \n<p>The prequels’ appeal was that they showed us realms from the <em>Star Wars</em> universe hinted at in comics and novels but never properly realized on screen. Lucas delivered that mostly, but <em>Clone Wars</em> kicked it up several notches. In “Chapter 5,” we travel to the ocean planet Dac for the first time. It’s home to two of my favorite Hasbro action figures: Admiral Ackbar and Squid Head. Their two species — the Mon Calamari and the Quarren, respectively — are divided by the Separatist civil war, and Yoda sends aquatic Jedi Kit Fisto to lend a helping hand, or er, lightsaber.</p> \n<p>Fisto got a moment or two during the climactic siege in <em>Attack of the Clones</em>, but his majesty isn’t truly revealed until “Chapter 5” of <em>Star Wars: </em><em>Clone Wars</em>. Underwater, Fisto chews through multiple Manta Subfigthers while never dropping his smile. He’s hit nirvana, and so have we. <em>Star Wars</em> fans love an elemental environment, and Dac proudly places itself alongside Hoth and Tatooine. Once these pesky firefights depart, their tourism board will ignite.</p> \n<hr /> \n<h2>6. More Than A Legend</h2> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-364516 size-full\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/The-Clone-Wars-Yoda-Legend.jpg\" alt=\"Yoda Legend\" width=\"800\" height=\"448\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/The-Clone-Wars-Yoda-Legend.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/The-Clone-Wars-Yoda-Legend-768x430.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p> \n<p><em>Attack of the Clones</em> showed us that Yoda is more than a legend; he is a legendary fighter. From the first shot, Genndy Tartakovsky’s <em>Clone Wars</em> doubles down. He may be short, he may be old, but he’s fast, and he cuts with a precision that comes from wisdom. Why stretch out a fight in ten moves when five will do.</p> \n<p>In “Chapter 15” of <em>Star Wars: Clone Wars</em>, Yoda diverts Senator Amidala’s mission to another planet. He can sense two Jedi in peril, and as he makes his way to their location, he is attacked by a Battle Droid battalion. He doesn’t hesitate. The blade comes out, and the heads come off. They’re not people; they’re parts.</p> \n<p>Along with investing heavily into <em>Star Wars</em> canon, Tartakovsky studied the Samurai cinema that initially inspired Lucas. Watching Yoda cut through these rusty chumps, you can see the movements of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmVgGn8Hvi8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Toshiro Mifune</a>. <em>Clone Wars</em>‘ lightsaber battles race to their conclusion, but they never lose their balletic quality. There is a rhythm to every conflict, and they’re built for the rewind button. You wanna watch Yoda dice on repeat.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/genndy-tartakovsky-clone-wars/2\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-361222 size-full\"
