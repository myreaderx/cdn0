The latter of these two issues can seem particularly daunting.  </p><p>The art of preparing a turkey can seem incredibly arcane to those who haven't done it before—foul it up enough and you'll give yourself salmonella.</p><p> Luckily, science is here to help. A quick review of thermodynamics provided by the <a href=\"https://www.omnicalculator.com/food/turkey-thawing\" target=\"_blank\">Turkey Thawing Calculator </a>at Omni Calculator will show you not only how to thaw your turkey correctly but how math and science are all around us.  </p><h3>\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\nHow to thaw a turkey using science!</h3><br/><p> The Omni Calculator <a href=\"https://www.omnicalculator.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">website</a> is home to calculators that can determine many things, including how <a href=\"https://www.omnicalculator.com/other/sunscreen\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">long you can be in the sun safely</a>,<a href=\"https://www.omnicalculator.com/other/sunscreen\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> </a>to the odds of your town having a <a href=\"https://www.omnicalculator.com/other/white-christmas\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">white Christmas</a>. It now has a dedicated tool for finding how long it will take you to prep your <a href=\"https://www.omnicalculator.com/food/turkey-thawing\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">turkey</a> in time for a socially distanced holiday. The <a href=\"https://www.omnicalculator.com/food/turkey-thawing\" target=\"_blank\">Turkey Thawing Calculator </a>was created by Jagiellonian University cognitive science graduate Maria Kluziak with the help of Wojciech Sas, a Ph.D. candidate in molecular magnetism and nanostructures at the Institute of Nuclear Physics in Poland. </p><p>The fundamental problem is that you need to add heat to the frozen bird to unfreeze it without also encouraging the growth of bacteria. To do this, you have to put the turkey somewhere where it will heat up slowly and evenly. There is a trick, though; this can take a long time because of the amount of energy involved. Exactly how long you need to spend on it can be hard to determine if you've never done it before.  </p><p>This is where practical, day-to-day science comes in. The processes of heating something are well-studied areas of thermodynamics which we use every day. <br/> <br/> As Kluziak tells Big Think:  </p><p>\"If you look closely, you'll notice how we're all surrounded by numbers. Yet most of the time people choose to go with their intuition while making day-to-day decisions. We, as scientists and experts in our own fields, are trying to build a world where people make better, more informed decisions backed by concrete science - Using physics to chill drinks, math to find out how much pizza to get, and even calculating how much groceries are enough to survive a quarantine. It works.\"</p><h3>So, how\ndo I thaw a turkey?</h3><br><img class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"522a8b8370fecb9dcb3bf483adea6fa5\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"07afc\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDgwNjA0Ny9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY0NzI3NTQzN30.hr2xv0tzFU_12bA-wwKwBPv0Tou_ZcdMoF1VDlov-0k/img.png?width=980\"/><p> By slowly exposing the turkey to cool air or water, it heats up to a point where the bird is above freezing but not so warm that bacteria will start multiplying. Two of the safe ways to do this stand above all others; you can thaw it in the refrigerator or the sink.<br/> <br/> Using a refrigerator can take days; the calculator creators suggest a day for every four pounds of bird. Doing it with cold water in the sink is faster, needing only two hours per pound, but requires that you drain and refill the sink with new, cold water every thirty minutes. The ideal temperature during thawing shouldn't exceed 39°F/4°C.</p><p>\"In our thawing model, we use a scientific approach, which is based on the use of heat transfer equations,\" the scientists write. \"Since these types of problems are, in general, very complicated, we use some approximations, which allow us to estimate the thawing time with reasonable accuracy. As a result, you can see how the average temperature of the turkey changes in time.\" </p><p>You can learn more about the equations and get tips on using the calculator <a href=\"https://www.omnicalculator.com/food/turkey-thawing\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. You can also learn why you shouldn't use a hairdryer or a tub full of hot water to do the job. <br/> <br/> One of the best parts of science is that its findings are often universally applicable. If you understand why something works in one case, you can use it everywhere else. Kluziak reminds us why this might be great for cooking:<br/> <br/> \"The rules that govern the process of thawing are roughly the same for every kind of food, what's different are the numbers that determine the more specific things like thawing time. The general ideas remain the same regardless of the food, and I would say they are pure common sense. For example, if you're defrosting food, don't do it at room temperature to avoid bacteria - this is true every time!\"<strong></strong></p><p><strong> </strong>Whoever said you'd never use the science you learned in high school at home didn't understand how often we use physics—this calculator remind us that it is everywhere. So fear not, ye first-time turkey chefs! Science can help you have your main course and eat it too.  </p></br><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/kvLFd9p3JX8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 24 Nov 2020 17:11:54 +0000","feedId":32,"bgimg":"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDc5OTE5MC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYyMTk0NzA3N30.nC1TAVdEuFUafTsZVxlV57B9f-R96Ubmf3_wTyCyXAA/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C361%2C0%2C323&height=700","linkMd5":"c1bc945e3b94f0aa8c8b13a717a742b4","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn17@2020_5/2020/12/01/06-05-37-833_32aa86e72d8a55a5.webp","destWidth":1245,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":51840,"destBytes":51840,"author":"Scotty Hendricks","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDc5OTE5MC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYyMTk0NzA3N30.nC1TAVdEuFUafTsZVxlV57B9f-R96Ubmf3_wTyCyXAA/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C361%2C0%2C323&height=700":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn17@2020_5/2020/12/01/06-05-37-833_32aa86e72d8a55a5.webp","https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDgwNjA0Ny9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY0NzI3NTQzN30.hr2xv0tzFU_12bA-wwKwBPv0Tou_ZcdMoF1VDlov-0k/img.png?width=980":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn4@2020_4/2020/12/01/06-05-58-577_07afc3c32ec2c63a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/kvLFd9p3JX8":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn23@2020_3/2020/12/01/06-05-58-488_07eac725b4f2fb4a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1606802711241},{"createdTime":"2020-12-01 14:05:11","updatedTime":"2020-12-01 14:05:11","title":"How has technology changed — and changed us — in the past 20 years?","link":"https://bigthink.com/technology-innovation/20-years-of-technology","description":"<img src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDg0ODIxMy9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY2NTU4NjY2M30.tdcmUOlU_Ey7h47-KQ_C-oNAvIF1QC7n09a12B08Sxc/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C167%2C0%2C0&height=700\"/><br/><br/>Just over 20 years ago, the <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/dotcom-bubble-crash-20-anniversary-technology-companies-ever-happen-again-1491385\" target=\"_blank\">dotcom bubble burst</a>, causing the stocks of many tech firms to tumble.<hr/><p> Some companies, like Amazon, <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/0711/5-successful-companies-that-survived-the-dotcom-bubble.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">quickly recovered</a> their value – but many others were left in ruins.

Recently, some Tech Pioneers have also approached this issue, including <a href=\"https://truepic.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">TruePic</a> – which focuses on photo identification – and <a href=\"https://www.twohat.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Two Hat</a>, which is developing AI-powered content moderation for social media.</p><h3></h3><br/><h2>Climate change and green tech</h2><p>Many scientists today are <a href=\"https://www.dw.com/en/climate-solutions-technologies-to-slow-climate-change/a-51660909\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">looking to technology</a> to lead us towards a carbon-neutral world. Though renewed attention is being given to climate change today, these efforts to find a solution through technology is not new. In 2001, green tech offered a new investment opportunity for tech investors after the crash, leading to a boom of investing in renewable energy start-ups <a href=\"https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/2001-when-green-tech-was-born\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">including Bloom Energy</a>, a Technology Pioneer in 2010.</p><p>In the past two decades, tech start-ups have only expanded their climate focus. Many today are focuses on initiatives far beyond clean energy to slow the impact of climate change.</p><p>Different start-ups, including Carbon Engineering and Climeworks from this year's Technology Pioneers, have started to roll out <a href=\"https://www.climatecentral.org/news/first-commercial-co2-capture-plant-live-21494\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">carbon capture</a> technology. These technologies remove CO2 from the air directly, enabling scientists to alleviate some of the damage from fossil fuels which have already been burned.</p><p>Another expanding area for young tech firms today is food systems innovation. Many firms, like Aleph Farms and Air Protein, are creating innovative meat and dairy alternatives that are much greener than their traditional counterparts.</p><h3></h3><br/><h2>Biotech and healthcare</h2><p>The early 2000s also saw the culmination of a <a href=\"https://money.cnn.com/2000/02/22/companies/biotech/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">biotech boom</a> that had started in the mid-1990s. Many firms focused on advancing biotechnologies through enhanced tech research.</p><p>An early Technology Pioneer,<a href=\"https://www.actelion.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Actelion Pharmaceuticals</a> was one of these companies. Actelion's tech researched the single layer of cells separating every blood vessel from the blood stream. Like many other biotech firms at the time, their focus was on precise disease and treatment research.</p><p>While many tech firms today still focus on disease and treatment research, many others have been focusing on healthcare delivery. Telehealth has been on the rise in<a href=\"https://www.ama-assn.org/practice-management/digital/telehealth-53-growing-faster-any-other-place-care\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> recent years</a>, with many young tech expanding virtual healthcare options. New technologies such as virtual visits, chatbots are being used to delivery healthcare to individuals, especially during Covid-19.</p><p>Many companies are also focusing their healthcare tech on patients, rather than doctors. For example Ada, a symptom checker app, used to be designed for doctor's use but has now shifted its language and interface to prioritize giving patients information on their symptoms. Other companies, like 7 cups, are focused are offering mental healthcare support directly to their users without through their app instead of going through existing offices.</p><p>The past two decades have seen healthcare tech get much more personal and use tech for care delivery, not just advancing medical research.</p><h3></h3><br/><p>In the early 2000s, many companies were at the start of their recovery from the bursting dotcom bubble. Since then, we've seen a large expansion in the way tech innovators approach areas such as new media, climate change, healthcare delivery and more.</p><p>At the same time, we have also seen tech companies rise to the occasion of trying to combat issues which arose from the first group such as internet content moderation, expanding climate change solutions.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/06/technology-pioneers-2020/\" target=\"_blank\">Technology Pioneers' 2020 cohort</a> marks the 20th anniversary of this community - and looking at the latest awardees can give us a snapshot of where the next two decades of tech may be heading.</p><p>Reprinted with permission of the <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">World Economic Forum</a>.

Some are based on alternative economic systems; some are designed to fit a specific view of human psychology; others hope to find harmony with nature. Like nearly every other area of intellectual endeavor, they all owe a debt to Plato, who did it first.  </p><p> His book contains the first known sketch for a Utopian society. Part allegory, part legitimate policy proposal, and part critique of existing systems, \"Republic\" offers many ideas that, allegedly, point to an ideal city.  </p><p> Unfortunately, as we'll soon see, nobody in their right mind would ever want to live <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/plato-ethics-politics/\" target=\"_blank\">there</a>. <br/> <br/> </p><h3>\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\nPutting\nsmart people in charge </h3><br/><p> Most utopian literature starts with trying to answer the \"what is the ideal society\" question. \"Republic\" begins by trying to answer the question: \"What is justice and is it good for a person to be just?\" This is a very big question, and Plato answers it through analogy via his main character Socrates. He suggests that justice in the ideal city is akin to justice in a person and that by understanding justice on the large, easy to see scale, we can understand it in the smaller.  </p><p> The city, dubbed the Kallipolis, would be governed by <em>Philosopher-Kings</em>. Selected for their wisdom, these rulers would be educated for 50 years before taking control of the city. Guided by their understanding of the good, the just, and how to achieve it, they would drive the city towards peace and prosperity. </p><p>Men and women would be treated equally, as Plato can find no reason why either sex is fundamentally unable to do what the other can within reasonable limits. All children would be given a quality education suitable to their natural talents. <br/> <br/> All of this is geared towards creating the best city possible, with high overall happiness, virtue, and harmony.  </p><h3>\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\nThis\nsounds great! How does it work?</h3><br><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"430\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cVLpdzhcU0g\" width=\"730\"></iframe><p>It works through an increasingly totalitarian series of laws and regulations that keep the city as a whole functioning with little regard for the stated desires of the populace. While many of the specifics are left unstated, what is said is plenty. <br/> <br/> The city features a rigidly enforced caste system, with no social movement possible for adults. However, their children may be promoted or demoted based on how they do in school. The guardian and warrior class that rules and defends the city will be without personal and private property but will live in communal abodes thanks to taxes collected from the lower classes. All the rulers will be chosen from this class. <br/> </p><p> Speaking of children, families would no longer exist as single units; instead, children produced by state-sanctioned marriages will be reared by the state. Alongside this will be a eugenics system featuring the infanticide of the children of \"inferior parents\" or any \"defective\" baby. Rigged lotteries will be used to assure lower quality parents don't contaminate the bloodlines of higher quality stock. <strong><br/> <br/> </strong>To assure that the truth is respected, all the poets will be sent into exile. All works of culture, from plays to bedtime stories, will be approved by the rulers. Naturally, these rulers are the only people capable of grasping \"truth\" rather than cheap imitations of it.</p><p>The system's endurance is made possible using a \"noble lie,\" assuring the common people that souls come in varieties. The philosopher kings have golden souls, their aids and warriors have silver ones, and the farmers, laborers, and craftsman are metaphysically made of brass and iron. The lie includes the warning that everything will fall apart if people of the wrong build are put in charge. <br/> <br/> Oh, and it is doomed to eventual failure as Plato suggests all political regimes are. <br/> <br/> Sounds pleasant, doesn't it?</p><h3></h3><br><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"430\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/U4Dm3NKsQu8\" width=\"730\"></iframe><p> <strong><br/> </strong>Karl Popper, whose objections to totalitarianism have appeared in several books, thought the ideas in \"Republic\" were taken seriously too many times.  </p><p> With its dedication to the idea that social-engineering is not only possible but often desirable, and that all is permitted so long as the polity is being driven towards the objective good, Popper suggests \"Republic\" was intellectually behind the totalitarian movements of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. <br/> <br/> Allegedly, Ayatollah Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran and leader of the Iranian Revolution, was inspired by \"Republic\" when crafting the Iranian government, complete with its own <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/04/obituaries/ayatollah-ruhollah-khomeini-89-the-unwavering-iranian-spiritual-leader.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Philosopher King.</a> How well this worked out is subject to debate.  </p><p> Bertrand Russell, another critic of the book, argued that it was intended to be taken seriously as a society that could be enacted in ancient Greece. A point supported by a variety of evidence. It's not too much of a stretch to say that plenty of people have taken this seriously at some point.</p><p>Any utopia is going to be based on assumptions about people, societies, justice, and other concepts that someone is going to find controversial. In the 2000 years since Plato wrote his down, everything he said has gone from being deemed correct to being dismissed as nonsense. As a result, his perfect city seems monstrous to us today. <br/> <br/> However, the discussion prompted by the debate over if Plato's Kallipolis is ideal, practical, or even possible has advanced our understanding of ethics and political philosophy for centuries. After all, we must ask ourselves why we like freedom, democracy, and the occasional disinformation when faced with an alternative that, allegedly, offers a better society to live in.  </p><p> As always, we might owe Plato a debt of thanks, even while we reject his philosophy wholesale.  </p></br></br><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/kzOYLtgmS4U\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 25 Nov 2020 19:17:05 +0000","feedId":32,"bgimg":"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDgyNzgxOC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYzMjY1NDg1OX0.W66lKYYXygH8KpexACwBx0dQeJ_0FotEbZCeT_FauRo/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C2%2C0%2C214&height=700","linkMd5":"ef8b17f9a9c1396a1592981686c59cfe","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn16@2020_5/2020/12/01/06-05-28-038_6687d2787dc48e2a.webp","destWidth":1245,"destHeight":701,"sourceBytes":180932,"destBytes":180932,"author":"Scotty Hendricks","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDgyNzgxOC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYzMjY1NDg1OX0.W66lKYYXygH8KpexACwBx0dQeJ_0FotEbZCeT_FauRo/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C2%2C0%2C214&height=700":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn16@2020_5/2020/12/01/06-05-28-038_6687d2787dc48e2a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/kzOYLtgmS4U":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn3@2020_1/2020/12/01/06-05-59-888_e3cae8bd4fa89aa8.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1606802711242},{"createdTime":"2020-12-01 14:05:11","updatedTime":"2020-12-01 14:05:11","title":"The 3 keys to solving complex global problems","link":"https://bigthink.com/skoll-foundation/how-to-solve-global-problems","description":"<img src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDc5NzgzMy9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY1Nzg0MDY3OH0.ggjQtnEwnLGMaFHrmHJ8H2UP67BHXYyHoM-qm1b4_VI/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0&height=700\"/><br/><br/><ul class=\"ee-ul\"><li>What does it actually take to drive large-scale change?

At first, Rick Strassman, a clinical associate professor of psychiatry at the University of New Mexico School of Medicine, only wanted to study the physiological strain of injecting DMT: heart rate, blood pressure, and so on. Given that psychedelics had been contentiously demonized for a generation, he wondered if physical consequences were as dangerous as advertised.</p><p>LSD had been administered tens of thousands of times in the 1950s and early 1960s. Did it really fry your brain like eggs, as the Reagans so confidently declared? </p><p>Over the next five years, Strassman administered 400 doses of <em>N,N-dimethyltryptamine</em> (DMT) to over 50 volunteers. It turned out that DMT, the fast-acting psychoactive ingredient in ayahuasca—the \"soul vine\" persists for hours only when blended with MAOIs to slow the breakdown of enzymes in your gut—has few negative effects. A longtime Zen Buddhist practitioner, Strassman noticed something else going on when over half of participants reported having profound religious experiences. </p><p>They were dying before dying. </p><p>Well, some of them were being visited by alien creatures, a phenomenon MAPS founder Rick Doblin possibly attributes to the \"setting\" part of \"set and setting\": tripping out in a sterile hospital room surrounded by clinicians in white lab coats certainly felt foreign, perhaps otherworldly. Other volunteers saw a beautiful light at the end of a tunnel and returned—a sensation noted in the ayahuasca literature for as long as we have records. </p><p>DMT is chemically related to serotonin and melatonin. The latter hormone is produced by the pineal gland, which is symbolically called the \"third eye\"—Descartes famously called it the \"seat of the soul.\" Since every mammal that's been tested (including humans) produce endogenous DMT, could our third eye possibly release this structural analog of tryptamine at death? Is it a coincidence that the pineal gland, according to Strassman, appears in fetuses at 49 days, the exact duration of the \"passage\" of souls described in The Tibetan Book of the Dead? </p><p>Strassman admits this is speculation. The anecdotes are irrefutable, however. His clinical work led to Charles Grob's government-approved research on <a href=\"https://maps.org/research-archive/ayahuasca/hoasca.html\" target=\"_blank\">ayahuasca</a> and <a href=\"https://maps.org/research-archive/mdma/mdmaucla.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">MDMA</a> in the 1990s, which opened the door to Johns Hopkins researchers <a href=\"https://hopkinspsychedelic.org/achievements\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">studying psilocybin</a> to treat the existential dread hospice patients encounter, which opened the floodgates to the psychedelic revolution occurring today. </p>That initial Johns Hopkins study, which found that psilocybin (structurally similar to DMT) eases distress by helping initiates die before they die, helped give form to Brian Muraresku's 12-year journey while <a href=\"https://bigthink.com/culture-religion/psychedelic-christianity\" target=\"_self\">writing his debut book</a>, \"The Immortality Key: The Secret History of the Religion With No Name.\"<h3>Brian Muraresku explains the potential role of psychedelics in Christianity</h3><br/><span class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"9d12252d13cebc4f3ca73f98e47ba60b\" style=\"display:block;position:relative;padding-top:56.25%;\"><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"auto\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jkL2DLBM1j0?rel=0\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;\" width=\"100%\"></iframe></span><p>Muraresku has been getting a lot of press since the book's publication, in part boosted by his appearance on Joe Rogan's podcast. The classicist speculates that the Christian Eucharist is rooted in the Eleusinian Mysteries, which may have involved the ceremonial ingestion of wine spiked with psychedelic ingredients. The idea of a psychedelic Christianity is not new, but Muraresku brings a detailed level of scholarship and compassion to the topic.</p><p>As he told me in a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aogj-08AMo&t=222s\" target=\"_blank\">recent interview</a>, the \"immortality key\" is not psychedelics, but the concept of dying before dying. He opens his book with a Greek inscription: \"If you die before you die / You won't die when you die.\" Muraresku, a devout Catholic raised in the Jesuit tradition, kicks off the discussion with an atheist from the Johns Hopkins trial. Despite her lack of faith, she felt an \"overwhelming, all-encompassing love\" that helped her deal with the inevitable consequences of mixed-cell ovarian cancer—really, the inevitable consequences of being an animal bound to die. </p><p>The Hopkins study went mainstream when Michael Pollan <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/09/trip-treatment\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">wrote about it</a> in the New Yorker. The results were stunning: 70 percent of participants felt a single dose of psilocybin produced the most meaningful (or among the top five) experience of their lives. Interestingly, the same result occurred after the famous Marsh Chapel experiment, when Timothy Leary and friends dosed Harvard Divinity School grad students with psilocybin; a quarter-century later, all but one rated the event in their top five. </p><p>Not only do you die before you die while under the influence of psychedelics, but you also gain a new perspective on life. The ego death that occurs during the ritual changes their orientation about existence. And what good is a religious experience if it can't be applied to living? </p><p>As Muraresku told me, </p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">\"[Psychedelics] is one tool in the Spiritual Toolkit. What I mean by 'the key' is in Greek, which is preserved at St. Paul's monastery: <em>if you die before you die, you won't die when you die</em>. <em>That's</em> the actual key. It's not psychedelics, it's not drugs; it's this concept of navigating the liminal space between what you and I are doing right now, and dreaming and death. In that state, the mystics and sages tell us, is the potential to grasp a very different view of reality.\"</p>Muraresku taps into a growing consensus that humans are \"wired\" for mystical experiences. He points to lead Johns Hopkins researcher, Roland Griffiths, who <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81-v8ePXPd4\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">believes</a> that mysticism is included in our operating system at birth. You just have to turn it on. While the effects of psychedelics can be replicated through the more arduous path of meditation, in the right set and setting anyone can tap into mystical states of consciousness. Psychedelics provide a shortcut to these states.<h3></h3><br/><img class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"bcb1e9ab2c85c23cfe63b350a0504076\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"4a5b4\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDgwMDEwNi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY2MjMzNTkxM30.v1whPhr51ijIHplKohusi_vIMpkbm2TCgX_K7Qx98iM/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C365%2C0%2C365&height=700\"/><p>Western religious leaders, especially those in Christianity and Islam, treat their prophets as standalone figures. The best you can hope for is being granted access to some special place after you die. Gnostics and Sufis—sects within those faiths that attempt to replicate their prophet's mysticism—are considered outcasts by mainstream religious figures. In some circumstances, they're outlawed, threatened, or even killed for their supposed heresy. </p><p>Sufis might spin for hours in ecstatic rapture to reach this mystical state, but as Muraresku's extensive research shows, psychedelics also tap into this \"secret\" knowledge that he believes to be at the heart of Christian—and if we extrapolate, <em>religious</em>—tradition. And to him, this is the essence of the religion, not a byproduct of the real faith. </p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">\"I didn't write this book to be anti-organized religion. In some cases, it's the exact opposite. In the intro, I mentioned Brother David Steindl-Rast, a Benedictine monk who is a hero of mine. He talks about the tension between mystics and the dogma and doctrine of organized faith. I don't think you can have one without the other. The balance, as Brother David says, is to rediscover that original visionary power and <em>live in it as a lived experience</em>. This is what Joseph Campbell says of religion being a <em>lived experience</em>. We're talking about emotional potential. That's how the great anthropologist Clifford Geertz defines religion: these powerful, pervasive, long-lasting moods and motivations. That only happens when you're talking about something that gets inside of people's bones. That's what the mystical experience is; it's how these religions are born. Brother David says it's virtually impossible to start a religion without mystical experience, like Moses in the burning bush, Paul on the road to Damascus, or Peter, in Acts, caught up in a trance.\"</p><p>Campbell's conversation with Bill Moyers in \"The Power of Myth\" nicely ties together this idea:</p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">\"People say that what we're all seeking is a meaning for life. I don't think that's what we're really seeking. I think that what we're seeking is an experience of being alive, so that our life experiences on the purely physical plane will have resonances with our own innermost being and reality, so that we actually feel the rapture of being alive.\"</p><p>The mythologist also advocated for a reformation of religion every generation so that the faith speaks to the times. This is effectively what Muraresku advocates for in \"The Immortality Key\": an honest conversation regarding the historical circumstances that birthed the world's most-followed religion in the hopes of applying the foundational lessons to our current reality. If that means a psychedelic ritual that shows you how to die before you die so that you may better know how to live, then it's time to rethink the role of the sacrament. </p><p>Mysticism is a universal phenomenon. The \"eternal return\" Mircea Eliade wrote about has been experienced throughout history in disparate regions of the world. As Strassman's and Griffiths's work shows, we retain the capability of dying before dying. In fact, current research on psilocybin, LSD, iboga, DMT, and ayahuasca show that these substances are helping people gain a perspective of their lives, be it in depression treatment, addiction recovery, or easing the pain of hospice care. A little mysticism goes a long way. </p><p>Let's move beyond this notion that mysticism only applies to a chosen few. In fact, let's reconsider the role of consciousness in general. Every religion has its own take on what happens after we die. Yet we have tools at our disposal to show us how to exist now: a living religion that speaks to the entire planet. </p><p>--</p><p><em>Stay in touch with Derek on <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/derekberes\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/DerekBeresdotcom\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a>.

But these diets, particularly veganism, may also boost your risk of suffering broken bones, according to a new study published in <a href=\"https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-020-01815-3\" target=\"_blank\">BMC Medicine</a>.</p><p>While the causes aren't totally clear, the researchers suggested it might stem from vegans not consuming enough calcium and protein, or from having a lower body mass index (BMI), which leaves the body more vulnerable to fractures.</p><p>The study is the largest to date on the relationship between fractures and non-meat diets. The researchers examined data from the long-running EPIC-Oxford study, which issued health surveys to nearly 55,000 people in the U.K. between 1993 and 2001, and followed up with them in 2010. </p><p>For the recent study, the researchers collected additional follow-up data in 2016 using National Health Service records. To study the relationship between diet and fracture risk, they sorted participants into four groups: meat eaters, fish eaters, vegetarians, and vegans. </p><p>After controlling for variables like physically activity, sex, smoking, dietary supplement intake, and alcohol use, the study found that vegans had a 43 percent increased risk of any kind of fracture compared to meat eaters. The increased risk for vegetarians was 9 percent.</p><h3></h3><br/><img class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"4b6244ab7f711f53c87f32f7e7cb45af\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"5177c\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDgwNjU5OC9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY0OTA1NDkyN30.if3oiMGzMJs25S5_qGO_NetVfJ_juYlgrMQKvG13xoA/img.png?width=980\"/><p>The results showed that vegans were especially vulnerable to hip fractures, suffering 2.3 times more cases than meat-eaters. Vegetarians and pescatarians were also more likely to suffer hip fractures, though to a lesser extent.</p><p>One explanation may be that non-meat eaters consume less calcium and protein. Calcium helps the body build strong bones, particularly before age 30, after which the body begins to lose bone mineral density (though consuming enough calcium through diet or supplement can <a href=\"https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Calcium-Consumer/\" target=\"_blank\">help offset losses</a>). Lower bone mineral density means higher risk of fracture.</p><p>Protein seems to help the body absorb calcium, <a href=\"https://www.bonejoint.net/blog/did-you-know-that-certain-foods-block-calcium-absorption/#:~:text=Historically%2C%20nutritionists%20have%20warned%20that,may%20increase%20intestinal%20calcium%20absorption.\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">when consumed in normal levels</a>. The recent study, along with past research, shows that people who don't eat meat tend to have lower levels of both protein and calcium. When the researchers accounted for non-meat eaters who supplemented their diets with calcium and protein, fracture risk decreased, but still remained significant.</p><h3></h3><br/><img alt=\"fruit and vegetables\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"c375cf2bd55d73ccaca466fd2aa3cb02\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"72fcc\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDgwNjYzMy9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY1NDQ5NTA0NX0.Bv3xDHpgkjGHJoXQhrYYKbZAiQ50oN8KzGJozI4SwD4/img.jpg?width=980\"/><p>Another explanation is body mass index (BMI). Non-meat eaters tend to have a lower BMI, which is associated with higher fracture risk, particularly hip fractures. In the new study, vegans with a low BMI were especially likely to suffer hip fractures. That might be because having more body mass provides a cushioning effect when people fall.</p><p>Still, the study has some limitations. For one, White European women were overrepresented in the sample. The researchers also didn't collect precise data on the type of calcium or protein supplementation, diet quality or causes of fractures.</p><p>Another complicating factor: Producers of vegan products, such as plant-based milk, are increasingly fortifying foods with nutrients like calcium and protein, so modern vegans are potentially at lower risk of deficiency.</p><p>The researchers wrote that their findings \"suggest that bone health in vegans requires further research.\"</p><h3>Staying healthy on a vegan diet</h3><br/><p>So, does a vegan diet necessarily lead to worse bone health? Not necessarily. But it's safe to say that people who don't consume meat, dairy and eggs should be extra vigilant about consuming enough essential nutrients. That can be harder than it seems.<br/></p><p>One major reason is that the body generally has an easier time absorbing nutrients from animal foods than plant-based products. So, while a salad could contain the same amount of calcium as a glass of milk, the body absorbs more calcium when you drink milk. What's more, there are some molecules and <a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/7-nutrients-you-cant-get-from-plants#5.-Docosahexaenoic-acid-(DHA)\" target=\"_blank\">nutrients you simply can't get from plants</a>.</p><p>As such, many vegans round out their diets with supplements, including zinc, iron, iodine, long-chain omega-3s, and vitamins D, K-2, and B-12, to name a few.

However, when the fish were given a burst of white noise, there was a dramatic difference in the brain activity of the fish with the Fragile X mutation.<br/></p><p>After seeing how the noise radically affected the fish brain, the team designed a range of 12 different volumes of sound and found the Fragile X model fish could hear much quieter volumes than the control fish. </p><p>\"The fish with Fragile X mutations had more connections between different regions of their brain and their responses to the sounds were more plentiful in the hindbrain and thalamus,\" <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/11/201110102527.htm\" target=\"_blank\">said Dr. Constantin</a>.</p><p>Essentially, the fish with Fragile X mutation had more connections between the regions of their brain and so their responses to the sounds were more notable. </p><p><strong>Understanding how this gene disruption works in zebrafish will give us a better understanding of sound hypersensitivity in humans with FXS or autism.</strong> </p><p>\"How our neural pathways develop and respond to the stimulation of our senses gives us insights into which parts of the brain are used and how sensory information is processed,\" Dr. Constantin said.</p><p>Using the zebrafish, Dr. Constantin and the team were able to gather insights into which parts of the brain are used to process sensory information. </p><p>\"We hope that by discovering fundamental information about how the brain processes sound, we will gain further insights into the sensory challenges faced by people with Fragile X syndrome and autism.\"</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/KKxFQX56ago\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 24 Nov 2020 09:42:00 +0000","feedId":32,"bgimg":"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDgwNjY3Mi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYzNDQwMzUxNn0.w11Wj3edr3y9-LkH--YrM-RgY2vCefA_xwYP9sxs6VM/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C155%2C0%2C156&height=700","linkMd5":"336fdf10c7b043e3b05891e3bb131a23","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn4@2020_3/2020/12/01/06-05-11-632_a75d444ace102ae6.webp","destWidth":1245,"destHeight":701,"sourceBytes":38740,"destBytes":38740,"author":"Jaimee Bell","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDgwNjY3Mi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYzNDQwMzUxNn0.w11Wj3edr3y9-LkH--YrM-RgY2vCefA_xwYP9sxs6VM/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C155%2C0%2C156&height=700":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn4@2020_3/2020/12/01/06-05-11-632_a75d444ace102ae6.webp","https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDgwMzcyNC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY1NDA1NDMyMn0.pHKAuK2ziH1Nkb2VgPbXxRnvFx8R8QrL5HqmuU8xP8I/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C432%2C0%2C432&height=700":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn55@2020_5/2020/12/01/06-05-58-441_6565dbf94514a22f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/KKxFQX56ago":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn30@2020_5/2020/12/01/06-05-58-493_b11b75a79dabfc00.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1606802711236},{"createdTime":"2020-12-01 14:05:11","updatedTime":"2020-12-01 14:05:11","title":"10 ways to prepare for the rise of intelligent machines – MIT study","link":"https://bigthink.com/technology-innovation/10-ways-prepare-intelligent-machines-mit-study","description":"<img src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDg0NTgzMi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY2NzU1NjE4MH0.yZMEAbKiMFr0NFH5wxbjN9J4612EI3GsmFPbB8YvcP8/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C191%2C0%2C192&height=700\"/><br/><br/><ul class=\"ee-ul\"><li>A new report by MIT experts proposes what humans should do to prepare for the age of automation.</li><li>The rise of intelligent machines is coming but it's important to resolve human issues first.</li><li>Improving economic inequality, skills training, and investment in innovation are necessary steps. </li></ul><hr/><h3></h3><br/><p>Does the coming age of intelligent machines mean billions of humans are about to be out of work? Not necessarily, concludes a new report from MIT's Task Force on the Work of the Future. The two-and-a-half year study on technology and jobs concluded that while some jobs will disappear, innovations will also drive the creation of new jobs for the lower and middle class workers. </p><p>The <a href=\"https://workofthefuture.mit.edu/research-post/the-work-of-the-future-building-better-jobs-in-an-age-of-intelligent-machines/\" target=\"_blank\">report</a>, \"The Work of the Future: Building Better Jobs in an Age of Intelligent Machines,\" also highlighted growing economic inequalities and recommended specific policies governments should embrace to make sure the transition to a future rife with robots doesn't leave large segments of the population behind. Institutional changes must accompany the technological ones. </p><p>The Task Force that produced the document was co-chaired by MIT Professors David Autor and David Mindell and executive director Dr. Elisabeth Reynolds, while the expansive group of experts involved more than 20 faculty members from 12 departments, and over 20 graduate students.</p><h3></h3><br/><p>One important note the study made is that while many expect automation to take over our lives in the near future, there is still time to prepare and make sure the transition to intelligent machines is in itself intelligent. Ultimately, it's not the machines we need to worry about, but the exacerbation of the existing human-made problems and deficiencies. Specific areas policy makers should focus on include investing into skills development and worker retraining, improving job quality, and expanding and shaping innovation.</p><p>Perhaps the central message of the study is that technology both takes away jobs and creates new ones. Around 63 percent of the jobs carried out in 2018 didn't even exist in 1940.</p><p>Here are the 10 ways humans should prepare for the rise of the role artificial intelligence will play in our lives:</p><h3>1. Increase private sector investment in skills and training</h3><br/><p>The group pinpoints the importance of private sector investment in training employees, especially with the purpose of increasing the upward mobility for lower-wage and less-educated workers. This will particularly affect minority workers, who are overrepresented in this group. The report estimates only about half of employees get training from their employers in any given year. </p><h3></h3><br/><img class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"6975eae751f3c8bceadbfec6c1af82d2\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"3379b\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDg0NTgzNS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY2MDM2Mjk3MX0.ktWTcxWd4ElTgeNJ4xujm30aCcbhile_V6Pa7dZcYFY/img.jpg?width=980\"/><h3>2. Significantly increase federal funding for training programs</h3><br/><p>The report advocates getting the government to fund training programs that can help lead to middle-class jobs for workers who don't have a four-year college degree. </p><h3>3. Support community colleges</h3><br/><p>The research team thinks community colleges should be supported by the federal government's money and policies to advance programs that connect employers to the education being received by students. The policies should be aimed at raising degree completion rates at community colleges. </p><h3>4. Invest in innovative training methods</h3><br/><p>Demonstration and field testing programs that work out new retraining and reemployment ideas should be given particular focus, according to the MIT scientists. </p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">\"Innovation improves the quantity, quality, and variety of work that a worker can accomplish in a given time,\" <a href=\"https://workofthefuture.mit.edu/research-post/the-work-of-the-future-building-better-jobs-in-an-age-of-intelligent-machines/\" target=\"_blank\">wrote</a> the report's authors. \"This rising productivity, in turn, enables improving living standards and the flourishing of human endeavors. Indeed, in what should be a virtuous cycle, rising productivity provides society with the resources to invest in those whose livelihoods are disrupted by the changing structure of work.</p><h3></h3><br/><img class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"70f520ef21111aa62d27e62cac78af44\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"9b332\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDg0NTgzNi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYyMDg4MjIxOX0.HIA_-6Ugm6VWIaEAX9gmHbUoa1MWH2ebJd72Uzr_rjA/img.jpg?width=980\"/><h3>5. Restore the real value of the federal minimum wage </h3><br/><p>The report spotlights the growing economic disparity between low-paid workers and the rest of society. Compared to Canadians, for example, low-paid Americans earn 26 percent less. Government policy should make sure people in traditionally low-paid service jobs like cleaning, groundskeeping, food service, entertainment, recreation, and health assistance get adequate pay and some economic security. To that end, the researchers propose that the minimum wage should be raised to at least 40 percent of the national median wage. This value should also be indexed to inflation. </p><h3>6. Modernize and extend unemployment insurance (UI) benefits </h3><br/><p>Several measures are recommended to improve unemployment insurance and extend it to workers that aren't usually covered. The report suggests allowing workers to count their most recent earnings to determine eligibility, determining eligibility based on hours rather than earnings, dropping the requirement that unemployed seek full-time work (because many hold part-time jobs), and reforming partial UI benefits from the states. </p><h3>7. Strengthen and adapt labor laws </h3><br/><p>Labor laws need to be both improved and better enforced, states the report. Contraction of private sector labor unions makes it harder for rank-and-file workers to bargain for wage growth that matches the growth of productivity growth. How workers are represented needs to be innovated as much as the technologies. Current U.S. laws \"retard the development of alternative approaches,\" write the researchers. For example, due to racial politics during the New Deal, sectors of the American workforce like domestic workers and agricultural workers are unable to participate in collective bargaining.</p><h3></h3><br/><img class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"cfc6844ec9909b88e51d94483206d8fa\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"28826\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDg0NTgzOS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY0Njk0OTcyMn0.xaGDETwNlt_GpnxZ7X0RNsedu_AYXvoPXaVnFi_MlmY/img.jpg?width=980\"/><h3>8. Increase federal research spending</h3><br/><p>In a proposal aimed at fostering innovation and making sure its benefits are experienced by workers, the MIT group thinks it's key to increase government spending on research, especially in areas not addressed by the private sector. These tend to involve longer-term research that addresses the social impacts of new technologies, zeroing in on major national problems, climate change, human health and similar larger research topics. Investing into research on human-centered AI, collaborative robotics and the science of education should be a part of this approach.</p><p>Small and medium-sized businesses should receive targeted government assistance to allow them to increase productivity via the new tech, advises the MIT team. </p><h3>9. Expand the geography of innovation in the United States</h3><br/><p>Innovation is increasingly \"concentrated geographically,\" think the researchers. For a country that has so many universities, entrepreneurs, and workers that are spread throughout, the benefits of innovation should be made available not only to more workers, but also to more of the country's regions. Each state can have its own Silicon Valley.</p><h3>10. Rebalance taxes on capital and labor</h3><br/><p>Innovation is necessary in the tax law as well, according to the report. It's important to change the manner in which the current tax code \"unduly favors investments in capital\" by eliminating accelerated depreciation allowances, applying corporate income tax equally to all corporations, and instituting an employer training tax credit.</p><p><a href=\"https://workofthefuture.mit.edu/research-post/the-work-of-the-future-building-better-jobs-in-an-age-of-intelligent-machines/\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full report here.</a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/i7-edvRhkis\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Mon, 30 Nov 2020 00:32:35 +0000","feedId":32,"bgimg":"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDg0NTgzMi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY2NzU1NjE4MH0.yZMEAbKiMFr0NFH5wxbjN9J4612EI3GsmFPbB8YvcP8/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C191%2C0%2C192&height=700","linkMd5":"bcdfa2cca84a0c261ab1dbb611d62a88","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn35@2020_1/2020/12/01/06-05-21-653_be22faff2077cd4e.webp","destWidth":1245,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":120628,"destBytes":120628,"author":"Paul Ratner","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDg0NTgzMi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY2NzU1NjE4MH0.yZMEAbKiMFr0NFH5wxbjN9J4612EI3GsmFPbB8YvcP8/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C191%2C0%2C192&height=700":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn35@2020_1/2020/12/01/06-05-21-653_be22faff2077cd4e.webp","https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDg0NTgzNS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY2MDM2Mjk3MX0.ktWTcxWd4ElTgeNJ4xujm30aCcbhile_V6Pa7dZcYFY/img.jpg?width=980":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn59@2020_6/2020/12/01/06-05-58-463_3379b8e1870e4f01.webp","https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDg0NTgzNi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYyMDg4MjIxOX0.HIA_-6Ugm6VWIaEAX9gmHbUoa1MWH2ebJd72Uzr_rjA/img.jpg?width=980":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn32@2020_4/2020/12/01/06-05-58-526_9b3327af6495d6c7.webp","https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDg0NTgzOS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY0Njk0OTcyMn0.xaGDETwNlt_GpnxZ7X0RNsedu_AYXvoPXaVnFi_MlmY/img.jpg?width=980":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn76@2020_5/2020/12/01/06-05-58-427_28826c53d11f3e38.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/i7-edvRhkis":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn24@2020_6/2020/12/01/06-05-58-496_51ff922b16c4c7f5.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1606802711231},{"createdTime":"2020-12-01 14:05:11","updatedTime":"2020-12-01 14:05:11","title":"Hyperbaric chambers used to reverse aging in \"Holy Grail\" study","link":"https://bigthink.com/surprising-science/hyperbaric-chambers-used-to-reverse-aging-in-holy-grail-study","description":"<img src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDc5OTAzMy9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYxMTM1OTA3N30.kjx68ZJ6-f6eUxeP-8s9m_V-IH2W_-sroS6jz0RtxE4/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C77%2C0%2C77&height=700\"/><br/><br/><ul class=\"ee-ul\"><li>Israeli scientists reversed two major processes involved in aging.</li><li>Their new therapy counteracted the shortening of telomeres and the accumulation of old and dying cells.</li><li>The study participants underwent oxygen treatments in hyperbaric chambers.</li></ul><hr/><h3></h3><br/><p>Scientists from Israel carried out a study that might prove groundbreaking in the human quest to slow the biological march of time. Researchers used oxygen treatments in hyperbaric chambers to stop blood cells from aging, actually making them grow younger.</p><p>The scientists devised a novel program that uses high-pressure oxygen in a pressure chamber to reverse two key processes that stem from aging. They were able to counteract the shortening of telomeres, which are protective regions at the ends of every chromosome, and the body's aggregation of old and poorly-functioning cells. </p><p>As we get older, our cells continue to divide, while the telomeres keep getting shorter. If they become too short, the cells stop replicating (becoming \"senescent\") and eventually die. This results in genetic aging. Analyzing the study participant immune cells, the researchers saw a lengthening in 38 percent of the telomeres, while the senescent cells decreased by 37 percent. This is similar to the cellular state of their bodies 25 years earlier, the researchers noted.</p><h3></h3><br/><img class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"99487cb8d6c51659a3ac74585c7cf4d9\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"2e091\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDc5OTAzNi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYyMjAyMzc5N30._RJpTC0ebp8iSbmV8HX06oMxfbLzPu8Z8jjpV9k5J6k/img.jpg?width=980\"/><h3></h3><br/><p>The study involved 35 healthy people over 64 years old, who underwent 60 hyperbaric sessions in 3 months.

The cough powder sells for the equivalent of $480 per kilogram, with a kilogram requiring the grinding up of about 3,500 bulbs. The plant is found in the loose rock fields lining the slopes of the Himalayan and Hengduan mountains in southwestern China.</p><p>As a perennial that produces just a single flower each year after its fifth season, it seems <em>Fritillaria</em> used to be easier to find. In some places its presence is betrayed by bright green leaves that stand out against the rocks among which which it grows. In other places, however, its leaves and stems are gray and blend in with the rocks. What's fascinating is that the bright green leaves are visible in areas in which Fritillaria is relatively undisturbed by humans while the gray leaves are (just barely) visible in heavily harvested areas. Same plant, two different appearances.</p><h3>How we know we're the cause</h3><br/><img alt=\"herb shop\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"907e152dd5ad0429aa6350c53f5a85aa\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"ccc8e\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDgyNzM0My9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYzMDc3NDQwMn0.lXwsG0ShcnMcVLl06APdEeEOY5_WOs4UfN8oVCKsgtc/img.png?width=980\"/><p>There are other camouflaging plants, but the manner in which <em>Fritillaria</em> has developed this trait strongly suggests that it's a defensive response to being picked. \"Many plants seem to use camouflage to hide from herbivores that may eat them — but here we see camouflage evolving in response to human collectors.\"</p><p>\"Like other camouflaged plants we have studied,\" Niu says, \" we thought the evolution of camouflage of this fritillary had been driven by herbivores, but we didn't find such animals.\" His close examination of Fritillaria leaves revealed no bite marks or other signs of non-human predation. \"Then we realized humans could be the reason.\"</p><p>In any event, says Professor Hang Sun the Kunming Institute, \"Commercial harvesting is a much stronger selection pressure than many pressures in nature.\"</p><h3>The study</h3><br/><p>Since herbalists have been plucking <em>Fritillaria</em> from the rocks for 2,000 years, one might hope a record would exist that could allow researchers to identify areas in which the plant has been most thoroughly picked. There is no such documentation, but Liu and Stevens were able to acquire this type of information for five years (2014–2019), tracking the harvests at seven <em>Fritillaria</em> study sites. This allowed them to identify those areas in which the plant was most heavily harvested. These also turned out to be the locations with the gray-leaf variant of <em>Fritillaria</em>.</p><p>Further supporting the scientists' conclusion that gray <em>Fritillaria</em> was more likely to evade human hands and live long enough to reproduce was that participants in virtual plant-identification tests confirmed the species was hard to spot in the wild.</p><p>\"It's possible that humans have driven evolution of defensive strategies in other plant species, but surprisingly little research has examined this,\" Stevens notes.</p><p>Hang Sun says such studies make clear that humans have become drivers of evolution on our planet: \"The current biodiversity status on the earth is shaped by both nature and by ourselves.\"</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/IOpUQ6-fvwA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 25 Nov 2020 17:09:38 +0000","feedId":32,"bgimg":"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDgyNzMxNS9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYxODgzNTA1N30.FnBi8wiahCoYvalx5JqTCAwLOX-ENTXQONT-uyCHzx8/img.png?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0&height=700","linkMd5":"32bf7d29db76590486332242ec91b2ed","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn37@2020_2/2020/12/01/06-05-11-575_84769fa8f83985a2.webp","destWidth":1245,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":17870,"destBytes":17870,"author":"Robby Berman","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDgyNzMxNS9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYxODgzNTA1N30.FnBi8wiahCoYvalx5JqTCAwLOX-ENTXQONT-uyCHzx8/img.png?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0&height=700":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn37@2020_2/2020/12/01/06-05-11-575_84769fa8f83985a2.webp","https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDgyNzM0My9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYzMDc3NDQwMn0.lXwsG0ShcnMcVLl06APdEeEOY5_WOs4UfN8oVCKsgtc/img.png?width=980":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn91@2020_3/2020/12/01/06-05-58-503_ccc8e013f50a55ee.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/IOpUQ6-fvwA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn68@2020_4/2020/12/01/06-05-58-495_61e7fd9429318d1d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1606802711243},{"createdTime":"2020-12-01 14:05:11","updatedTime":"2020-12-01 14:05:11","title":"Researchers 3D bioprint realistic human heart model for the first time","link":"https://bigthink.com/technology-innovation/3d-bioprinting","description":"<img src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDgwMTgwOS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY1MTg2MzQwOH0.itOpQeN9gpUzmhUC4VP901MbvM8bcGscQZmy9J1LMO4/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C5%2C0%2C6&height=700\"/><br/><br/><ul class=\"ee-ul\"><li>3D bioprinting involves using printers loaded with biocompatible materials to manufacture living or lifelike structures.</li><li>In a recent paper, a team of engineers from Carnegie Mellon University's College of Engineering developed a new way to 3D bioprint a realistic model of the human heart.</li><li>The model is flexible and strong enough to be sutured, meaning it could improve the ways surgeons train for cardiac surgeries.</li></ul><hr/><h3></h3><br/><p>A team of engineers has created a new method for 3D bioprinting realistic, full-sized models of the human heart.

We have achieved so much because we are friendly and decent. The radical thinker Rutger Bregman paints a new, more beautiful portrait of humanity.</p><p>Try standing in front of the mirror and remember the worst things ever done – by you personally, and by <em>Homo sapiens</em> as a whole. And smile, because history shows that we are doing much better than you think. This subversive idea belongs to a Dutch historian, writer and TED lecturer. In his new book, <em>Humankind:</em> <em>A</em> <em>Hopeful</em> <em>History</em>, he finds out whether the conviction that humans are selfish, hostile and destructive by nature is actually true. And if we turn out to be intrinsically good after all, what would it change?</p><p>Rutger Bregman already shook up the minds of politicians, businesspeople and the general public several years ago in his book <em>Utopia for Realists And How We Can Get There</em>, in which he argued that a better world could be built straight away. Bregman's critics consider him a naïve fantast, but many CEOs and national leaders are seriously considering introducing his revolutionary postulates, such as much shorter workdays and universal basic income. In his new book, Bregman goes even further, proposing that we turn the world upside down. More precisely, he wants to put straight the image of humankind as created by philosophy, science and the media. And to change our behaviour for the better.</p><p>The author has created a daring, fresh story, filled with fascinating examples, analyses and discoveries, and constructed it as if it were an investigation. The accused was <em>Homo sapiens</em>, a species with alleged murderous tendencies since the dawn of time, seeing his own viciousness reflected in everything and everyone around. Bregman revised the evidence in question and tore the lining of this negative story, reaching deep into the discoveries of archaeologists, historians and biologists. He bursts through the philosophy of Hobbes, who had a defining influence on the image of humans, perceived as warmongering species who must be controlled by a powerful, Leviathan-like government at all times. Bregman uncovers swindles ensconced in the most famous psychological theses of the 20th century, laying bare the manipulations of such celebrities as Philip Zimbardo and Stanley Milgram, whose famous experiments are considered the final evidence that a Nazi and sadist is lurking in every one of us. Yet years later, those claims turned out to be a sham.</p><p><br/></p><h3></h3><br/><p>Bregman crushes the myths built by bestselling authors such as Nobel Prize laureate William Golding, best known for his novel <em>Lord of the Flies</em>, and by big media like <em>The New York Times</em>. He boldly debates the most popular authors of recent years: <a href=\"https://przekroj.pl/en/society/the-gospel-according-to-pinker-tomasz-stawiszynski\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Steven Pinker,</a> Yuval Noah Harari and Malcolm Gladwell. With the energy of a young and fearless researcher, he dug through all the critical files, finding new evidence in old cases. The turn of perspective is so surprising that <em>Humankind</em> keeps the reader on their toes. Whatever you think about humans, Bregman will derail your viewpoint. And there's probably nothing as baffling as how much we struggle with accepting the idea that we are better than we thought we were. The thought that most of us are intrinsically good turns out to be a challenge, as if the bar has suddenly gone higher. Such a positive image makes us want to try harder.</p><p>Bregman uses the phenomenon we call the Pygmalion effect, meaning that we become what others see in us. Those rats that researchers assumed to be intelligent did better with the tasks they encountered. Children with supportive parents and teachers do better at school and in life. And people who see good in themselves, start to cultivate it. Bergman believes cynicism to be an avoidance strategy.</p><blockquote>The belief that people are vicious and that the world is going to the dogs justifies passivity. Optimism, however, has an opposite effect – it requires us to strive for kindness, trust, and generosity in an active way.<br/></blockquote><p>The common belief that crisis awakens the most primitive instincts in people is not reflected in the facts, writes Bregman. He calls it the greatest misunderstanding in history. \"No, no, you go first…\", \"Please, you go ahead, I'll follow you,\" said the people leaving the towers of the World Trade Center, when their offices were ablaze and the building was starting to melt. There was no panic; almost everyone remained polite. This was confirmed by recordings and testimonies from the survivors.</p><h3></h3><br><p>On Christmas Eve of 1914, 100,000 soldiers, mostly German and French, left the trenches to meet. They exchanged gifts and sang carols. For years to come, most of them were shooting high above their enemies' heads, so as not to wound them. The same thing happened at other wars, before and after that one. After the Battle of Gettysburg in 1863, 90% of the guns were loaded and unused. The murderous instinct is a myth, Bregman insists.</p><p>Hitler's air force raided London in 1940 to break the spirit of the British. Instead, people put messages in their windows, such as: \"More open than usual\" or \"Windows broken, booze still strong!\" The English kept calm. Churchill was proud, but soon he made the same mistake, assuming he could break the Germans with air raids instead. After the bombing, Dresden responded in the same spirit as London – with acts of everyday kindness, help and optimism.</p><p>After the war and annihilation, many sought an answer to what made the German soldiers so persistent and determined. The reasons were said to be blind obedience and fanaticism. And yet, Bregman reveals data that was previously omitted and passed-over in silence: the main force keeping the soldiers going was the sense of solidarity and camaraderie. They didn't want to abandon their mates, with whom they grew up and trained. When presented in such light, those alleged beasts suddenly start looking a lot like boys from the yard. Like ourselves, even.</p><h3></h3><br/><p>Think again, insists the Dutch historian, and see how tragedy brings out the best in people. Evil only exists in us when it masks as good and nestles in our system of beliefs as a sense of righteousness, something important to the world. And don't believe the media, he warns, because they feed on extremes. The media distort reality and teach us to believe in evil. For example, take the famous story of the New York woman named Kitty who was stabbed and died alone in front of her house in 1964, watched by her 38 indifferent neighbours, out of whom just one called the police, the rest declining to get involved. That's the version promoted by <em>The New York Times</em>, with alarming words about an \"epidemic of callousness\". The facts, as shown by Bregman, are very different. Most of the witnesses didn't see the attack – they just heard the noise. Half of them called the police, and Kitty died in her friend's arms. What happened to the perpetrator? He was caught soon later when he was leaving someone's apartment carrying a TV, and an alarmed neighbour stopped him. People can feel, express concern, and help others – those are the facts on which the media rarely report. There are over a dozen such spectacular deconstructions in Bregman's book, using new evidence he pulls out like trump cards, one after another.</p><p>We follow the rules of kindness and cooperation not only in times of crisis, but also in everyday life. Bregman echoes other researchers who describe the phenomenon of ordinariness as the dominant truth about the world. He refrains from promoting naïve theses, and the strength of his reasoning lies in returning to the right proportions. There is more good in the world, so much of it that we take it for granted and forget to define it. In his view, society is not founded on obedience to the government, which makes us aggressive and insensitive, but on the human trust. That's why real democracy (as opposed to the current rule of sociopath elites over the sensitive majority) is possible. More examples? In Venezuela and Brazil, budget management in many cities was passed over to the inhabitants. As a result, they saw an increase in social investments and education, while poverty and crime plummeted. In Norwegian prisons, guards and inmates spend time together, share duties and wear no uniforms. The outcomes were shorter times of imprisonment, fewer re-offenders, and a lot of savings. And so on.</p><p><em>Humankind</em> rearranges the mind like no other book published over the past few years. It should be mandatory reading in the 21st century, as it gives some balance to another milestone in the human autobiography, the bestselling <em>Sapiens</em> by Yuval Noah Harari from 2014. Bregman insists that optimism is solidly founded on facts. It is not a dream, just a new realism.</p><p><em>Translated from </em><a href=\"https://przekroj.pl/artykuly/recenzje/czlowiek-czlowiekowi-czlowiekiem\" target=\"_blank\"><em>the Polish</em></a><em> by Aga Zano</em></p><p>Reprinted with permission of <a href=\"https://przekroj.pl/en/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" style=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Przekrój</a>.

Ancient literature, especially ancient Greek epics, explore what it means to be human and part of a community. </p><p>In the Greek classic “The Iliad,\" Homer specifies few universal rights, but one that emerges clearly is the expectation of proper lamentation, burial and memorial. </p><h3></h3><br/><h2>Valuing life in death</h2><p>Homer's \"Iliad\" explores the themes of 10 years of war – the Trojan War – over a narrative that lasts around 50 days. It shows the internal strife and the struggles of the Greeks as they try to defend themselves against the Trojans.</p><p>It humanizes the city of Troy by emphasizing the scale of loss and suffering and not just the boastful nature of its kings and warlords.</p><p>The epic <a href=\"http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0134\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">begins with the recognition</a> that the rage of its main character, Achilles, on account of a slight to his honor, \"created myriad griefs\" for the Greeks and \"sent many strong heroes to the underworld.\"</p><p>The epic's conflict <a href=\"http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hom.+Il.+1.100&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0134\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">starts</a> when king Agamemnon, leader of the Greek army, deprives the semi-divine hero Achilles of Briseis, an enslaved woman he was awarded as a prize earlier in the war.</p><p>Briseis is said to be Achilles' \"geras,\" a physical token indicating the esteem his fellow Greeks have for him. The meaning of the word \"geras\" develops as the poem progresses. But as readers learn alongside Achilles, physical objects are essentially meaningless when one is going to die anyway.</p><p>By the end of the epic, physical tokens of honor are replaced in importance by burial rites. Zeus accepts that his mortal son Sarpedon can at best receive \"the geras of the dead\" when he is <a href=\"http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0134%3Abook%3D16%3Acard%3D394\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">buried and mourned</a>. Achilles too insists that mourning is \"the geras of the dead\" when he gathers the Greeks to <a href=\"http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0134%3Abook%3D23%3Acard%3D1\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">honor his fallen comrade, Patroklos</a>.</p><p>The epic ends with a justification for the burial of Achilles' opponent, Hector, the greatest of the Trojan warriors and another victim of Achilles' rage.</p><p>For Hector's funerary rites, the Greeks and the Trojans agree to an armistice. The Trojans gather and clean Hector's body, cremate him, and bury his remains below a monumental tomb. The women of the city tell the story of the brave hero <a href=\"https://chs.harvard.edu/CHS/article/display/6668\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">in their laments</a>.</p><p>This is its foundational narrative – that burial rites are essential to the collective work of communities. Failure to observe burial provokes crisis. In the Iliad, the gods meet to resolve <a href=\"http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0134%3Abook%3D24%3Acard%3D22\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">the problem of Hector's unburied body</a>: Achilles must quit his rage and give Hector's body back to his family.</p><h3></h3><br/><h2>A divine right</h2><p>This narrative is repeated in other ancient Greek myths. Best known, perhaps, is Sophocles' \"Antigone,\" a Greek tragedy dating from the 440s B.C. In this play, two brothers, Eteocles and Polynices, are killed in their fight for control of the city.</p><p>Creon, their uncle, who takes over the city, <a href=\"http://philosophyfaculty.ucsd.edu/faculty/ewatkins/Phil107S13/Sophocles-Antigone.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">forbids burial of one</a>. The play's conflict centers around their sister Antigone, who buries her brother against the new king's wishes, consigning herself to death.</p><p>In opposing this basic right, Creon is shown to suffer in turn, losing his wife and son to suicide in the process. In response to the capital punishment of Antigone for performing the rites due to her brother, his son Haemon takes his life and his mother Eurydice follows him.</p><p>Properly honoring the dead – especially those who have died serving their people – is from this perspective a divinely sanctioned right. Furthermore, mistreatment of the dead brings infamy on the city and pollution. Plague often curses cities and peoples who fail to honor their fallen.</p><p>This is central to the plot of \"<a href=\"http://classics.mit.edu/Euripides/suppliants.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Suppliants</a>,\" another Greek play telling us the story of the conflict between the sons of Oedipus, king of the Greek city of Thebes. In this play by Euripides, the Thebans refuse to bury any of the warriors who fought against their city. The crisis is resolved only when the Athenian hero Theseus leads an army to force them to honor the dead.</p><p>One of the most famous examples of classical rhetoric shares in the tradition of honoring the dead as a public duty. Greek historian Thucydides writes about the funeral oration of Pericles, who was a popular leader in Athens during the 430s B.C.</p><p>On the occasion of offering the \"<a href=\"https://oxfordre.com/classics/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780199381135.001.0001/acrefore-9780199381135-e-2461\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">epitaphios</a>,\" a speech over the fallen war dead, Pericles articulates his vision of the Athenians as standing against foreign threats in the past.</p><p>Memories of the past were an important guide to the future. This is in part why the funeral oration became so important in Athenian life: It provided an opportunity to explain why those lives were sacrificed in service of a shared civic mission and identity.</p><h3></h3><br/><h2>Communities of memory</h2><p>Even today, memories are shaped by stories. From local communities to nations, the stories we tell will shape what we will remember about the past.</p><p>Researchers from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation predict that an estimated 200,000 people in the U.S. will have died from the coronavirus <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-19-united-states-coronavirus-deaths-projection-400000-by-end-of-year/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">by Sept. 26</a> and some 400,000 by the year-end.</p><p>Many people who see loved ones die will deal with unresolved loss, or \"<a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/complicated-grief/symptoms-causes/syc-20360374\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">complicated grief</a>\" – grief that results from not knowing what happened to one's loved ones or without having the social structures to process their loss. That grief has been compounded by the current isolation. It has prevented many from carrying out those very rites that help us learn to live with our grief.</p><p>Just recently, I lost my 91-year-old grandmother, <a href=\"https://www.rivertowns.net/obituaries/obits/6665780-Beverly-Jean-Mjolsness\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Beverly Mjolsness</a>, to a non-coronavirus death. My family made the hard decision not to travel across the country to bury her. Instead, we gathered for a video memorial of a celebration of a life well-lived. As we did so, I could see my family struggling to know how to proceed without the rituals and the comfort of being together.</p><p>Such grief that does not allow for collective in-person memorialization can turn into <a href=\"https://www.apa.org/news/apa/2020/04/grief-covid-19\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">debilitating trauma</a>. Our public discourse, however, when it has not tried to minimize the number of the dead or the continuing threat, has not sought to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/national-mourning-coronavirus/2020/05/15/b47fc670-9577-11ea-82b4-c8db161ff6e5_story.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">provide any plan for memorials</a>, now or in the future.</p><p>What Homer and Sophocles demonstrate is that the rites we give to the dead help us understand what it takes to go on living. I believe we need to start honoring those we have lost to this epidemic. It will not just bring comfort to the living, but remind us that we share a community in which our lives – and deaths – have meaning.<img alt=\"The Conversation\" src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/145827/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic\"/></p><p><a href=\"https://theconversation.com/profiles/joel-christensen-965979\" target=\"_blank\">Joel Christensen</a>, Associate Professor of Classical Studies, <em><a href=\"https://theconversation.com/institutions/brandeis-university-1308\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Brandeis University</a></em></p><p>This article is republished from <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Conversation</a> under a Creative Commons license.

Midway through the film, the robots are taking over. By the end, humans have won, though barely. Like Godzilla, AI is never really gone. The monster that is our darkest shadow always lurks, ready to lurch back into action.</p><p>Fantasy aside, AI <em>is</em> a real problem. As Richard Clarke and R.P. Eddy write in their 2017 book, \"Warnings,\" 47 percent of all U.S. jobs could be put out of commission in 20 years—and that was predicted by Oxford researchers in 2013. A McKinsey study from the same year predicts AI will \"depose 140 million full-time knowledge workers worldwide.\" </p><p>Large-scale unemployment is dangerous, especially in terms of governmental action. The current administration has basically ignored AI, while the incoming administration does have a <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2020/11/10/biden-harris-administation-artificial-intelligence/\" target=\"_blank\">research platform</a>. How that factors into job loss remains to be seen. Clarke and Eddy point to various responses to the Great Depression:</p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">\"In 1932, the U.S. responded with the New Deal. Western Europe responded with Fascism and the imminent rise of Nazism, Russia deepened into Stalinism and five-year plans.\" </p><p>There's also the question of efficacy. How do we really know when AI is working as planned? Statistics rely on two main confidence intervals: 95 percent and 99 percent. While the latter seems to inspire confidence from large data sets, do you want, for example, an AI medical intervention to have a 1 percent chance of failure? </p><p>Alexander Amini, a PhD student in the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) and first author of a <a href=\"http://www.mit.edu/~amini/pubs/pdf/deep-evidential-regression.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">new paper</a> on neural networks, <a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/2020/neural-network-uncertainty-1120\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">says</a> we shouldn't have to take that risk.</p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">\"One thing that has eluded researchers is the ability of these models to know and tell us when they might be wrong. We really care about that 1 percent of the time, and how we can detect those situations reliably and efficiently.\"</p><p>Deep learning neural networks are being used in autonomous driving and medical diagnoses, among many other fields. A 1 percent risk in an AI that filters social media feeds might not seem like much of a gamble, but when it comes to drug design or medical image analysis, such a risk could result in tragedy. </p><h3></h3><br/><img class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"4e1ca228c21bbb9fe4802ec9407dcd9e\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"d0a33\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDgwNzU4My9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY2MDQ5OTY2OX0.sK8rPGPkb5Q692KejassaZ_2T0cOQAEGMa5Wj1Z5a24/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100&height=700\"/><p>On the road, 1 percent could be the difference between stopping at an intersection or rushing through just as another car runs a stop sign. Amini and colleagues wanted to produce a model that could better detect patterns in giant data sets. They named their solution \"deep evidential regression.\"</p><p>Sorting through billions of parameters is no easy task. Amini's model utilizes uncertainly analysis—learning how much error exists within a model and supplying missing data. This approach in deep learning isn't novel, though it often takes a lot of time and memory. Deep evidential regression estimates uncertainty after only one run of the neural network. According to the team, they can assess uncertainty in both input data <em>and</em> the final decision, after which they can either address the neural network or recognize noise in the input data.</p><p>In real-world terms, this is the difference between trusting an initial medical diagnosis or seeking a second opinion. By arming AI with a built-in detection system for uncertainty, a new level of honesty with data is reached—in this model, with pixels. During a test run, the neural network was given novel images; it was able to detect changes imperceptible to the human eye. Ramini believes this technology can also be used to pinpoint <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/13/what-are-deepfakes-and-how-can-you-spot-them\" target=\"_blank\">deepfakes</a>, a serious problem we must begin to grapple with.</p><p>Any field that uses machine learning will have to factor in uncertainty awareness, be it medicine, cars, or otherwise. As Amini says, </p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">\"Any user of the method, whether it's a doctor or a person in the passenger seat of a vehicle, needs to be aware of any risk or uncertainty associated with that decision.\"</p><p>We might not have to worry about alien robots turning on us (yet), but we should be concerned with that new feature we just downloaded into our electric car.

On the first day after our arrival, I woke up early to take a walk and pick some chanterelles for breakfast. As bad luck would have it, however, I left my glasses in the tent, and without them, I struggle to tell mushrooms apart. Still, I resolved to carry on, and having collected a handful of becapped specimens I returned to our camp.\n</p><p>\n\tMy friends, still fast asleep, did not take me up on my breakfast offer, so I ate my tofu and mushroom scramble alone. And seeing the effect it had on me, I quickly realized I had accidentally collected some mushrooms from the <em>Psilocybe</em> genus. This little mishap was a surprise, but I didn't let it throw me off balance – I let the psilocybinous song carry me away. And now, I shall report on the places I visited and the things I saw. If I find the right words, that is.</p><h3></h3><br/><p>The ground began to rumble, or maybe rather stir and writhe, as if there was a gargantuan snakelike creature breathing underneath its surface. A low murmur and chemiluminescent glow seeped from between patches of moss and foliage. Greenish tentacles glimmered in the murky ground, twisting and turning, and showed me the way towards the heart of the forest. I recognized those viridescent threads to be mycelium, made of the hyphae that are the basis of fungi's organization system, whereas the glow seemed to be caused by luciferins – a protein capable of emitting light as the result of an enzymatic reaction. Once this mycological phenomenon dawned on me, I was no longer anxious and walked ahead.</p><p>As I was forcing my way through the thicket, in my mind I tried to systematize all the information about fungi I have learned. They are a kingdom that belongs to the group of eukaryotes, which encompasses all cellular organisms that pack their genetic material into chromosomes kept in their cells' nuclei. This makes them quite similar to humans, which convinced me even more that I could trust the call that beckoned me forward, especially since those organisms boast ancient evolutionary history. The oldest fossils that have been identified as remnants of fungi are estimated to be around one billion years old, which indisputably proves the primaeval nature of the wisdom that summoned me.</p><p>With every step that brought me closer to the heart of the land, I could hear the commotion of heated dispute grow louder around me. Then I remembered a certain theory linking the consumption of hallucinogenic mushrooms by the ancestors of contemporary humans with the development of our consciousness. If not for the phenomenon of synaesthesia, the meaning of the conversations I heard would surely have been lost on me. After all, fungal communication happens noiselessly, with the aid of chemical substances that flow through the mycelium. Luckily, I could feel the vibrations of the ground and electromagnetic impulses, catching even the tiniest of signal molecules so that I understood everything that was being said.</p><h3></h3><br/><p>I finally arrived at an arena shaped like an ascocarp, the fruiting body of the sac fungi. In the stalls sat tens of thousands of various species of fungi, with the elders occupying the seats at the top of the assembly hall, chaired by the Hatter who looked strikingly similar to the well-known and liked Jersey cow mushroom.</p><p>Silencing the crowd, he announced:</p><p>\"Welcome, human, son of mycelium.\"</p><p>\"Greetings to you, my brothers,\" I answered kindly, filled with a feeling of unity with all the organisms that surrounded me.</p><p>\"Your current state is no accident. You have been chosen from all the <em>Homo sapiens</em> to help us solve the most pressing problems of the modern world. Are you ready to serve our cause?\"</p><p>\"If you're talking about the same problems that gnaw at my mind every day, I will be happy to help,\" I said to him, but felt that I had addressed each and every fungus individually, as they were an inseparable entity.</p><p>\"We know your thoughts, but it might be more anthropomorphic-friendly to allow you to express your worries about the state of the world verbally. As a kingdom of sage species, we have decided to try and save our shared motherland. The only one we all have.\"</p><p>\"It would be very helpful if I did a quick recap of what we know about you. Please, don't get me wrong. In my current state, nothing is certain, and such a historic exchange deserves to be fully comprehended by both sides.\"</p><p>\"We know what you mean. And we would very much like to know what you, humans, think of us exactly.\"</p><p>\"As far as I'm aware, you were classified as plants for a long time. Your ability to move is far from impressive, and you seem to be well-rooted in the soil. Even mycelium is deceptively similar to plant roots. What is it that makes you different from other kingdoms of the living world?\"</p><p>\"Actually, some of us can move at a rather speedy pace, and several characteristics differentiate us from plants. First, we have no tissue. Our bodies are made entirely of thickly weaved mycelium. Also, we are heterotrophs, meaning that we absorb nutrition from other organisms, namely decomposing organic matter. Of course, we help it decompose through releasing our digestive enzymes into the environment. This ability makes us the main cleaners of the natural world. We can also feed parasitically, hunt, and cooperate with autotrophic organisms.\"</p><p>\"But you are not only what you eat?\"</p><p>\"We are also different from other organisms on a biochemical level. We have our cell walls just like plants do, and they serve the same purpose – to protect the inside of the cell. Interestingly, however, the main ingredient of our walls is not cellulose, as it happens for plants, but chitin, a polysaccharide also found in the exoskeletons of various insects. It's easy to tell us apart from animals because we use ergosterol instead of cholesterol to build our cellular membrane. But actually, on a genetic level, we are more closely related to animals than we are to plants.\"</p><p>\"And I imagine this genetic similarity must be the reason for the brotherly feeling that overwhelms me so. I have heard some rumours about the largest organism on our planet. They say it's a fungus that weighs 440 tonnes! I must say, I find it quite hard to comprehend. If that were true, its cap would be visible from space.\"</p><p>\"You are taking it a little too far. Cap-and-stem fungi are called mushrooms. They are the fruiting bodies of a fungus. Its essence that is mycelium remains hidden underground and only grows above it to reproduce. It is the mycelium of our stumpy brother that you believe to be the largest living organism. Unfortunately, he could not make it to our meeting. He is a little listless due to his impressive age and bulk. Nobody can remember it very well, but he claims to be more than 2500 years old.\"</p><p>\"Please, do send him my regards. There is another question I must ask you, though. I have heard a lot about some pioneer species, capable of preparing a low-grade environment for being populated with more demanding species, including herbaceous plants. That makes it just one step away from a fully-developed ecosystem.\"</p><p>\"Thanks to the wide range of enzymes we produce, we can decompose next to everything! We are not intimidated by rocky areas and conflagration sites. Mycelium and spores can be found even by receding glaciers and in the desert. By processing unwelcoming environments, we create a layer of fertile ground on which life can thrive. It was thanks to us that the first plants could populate dry land. But enough about us. Now it's time to discuss the problems you have caused for the Earth, and which we can solve. Ask ahead.\"</p><p>\"You have been around for a long time, so you must be familiar with the history of fossil fuels. We use them as our energy source. We do it by burning them, and while doing so, we release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Recently, this has become a burdensome issue for our civilization. What should we do?\"</p><p>\"Forests sponge up more than one-third of all CO2 emitted by the plunderous consumption culture of the current era, aptly named the Anthropocene. Plants absorb CO2 and transform it into biomass in the process of photosynthesis. And while we fungi do not photosynthesize, our role in the accumulation of CO2 could hardly be overstated. By establishing symbiotic relationships with plants, we increase the speed of their growth and improve their quality of life. When your scientists compare the efficiency of CO2 'cleaning' in a forest with a low level of mycorrhiza – that is the coexistence of plants and fungi – and a forest with a high level of such interaction, it becomes clear that fungi-rich ecosystems manage this task much better. We must, however, bring another issue to your attention. CO2 is not the only by-product of your activity. Pollution caused by nitrogen compounds is also very impactful, and we aren't very fond of them. Take care of us, and we will take care of you.\"</p><p>\"I shall do whatever I can to convince my people. And speaking of fossil fuels, another issue comes to mind. When we extract and transport petroleum, we sometimes cause spills that pollute the environment. Do you have any advice in this department?\"</p><p>\"It is but a simple matter. We have several families in our ranks who can digest the hydrocarbons that make up this black gore. Other living organisms can use the products of its decomposition. Not only do we purify contaminated soil, but we can also cooperate with plants that grow there, and help them survive. In the right conditions, petroleum waste could become incubators of earth.\"</p><p>\"It seems that some of our most pressing ecological issues could be tackled with fungal power. But we also have other problems at hand. Human life is becoming longer than ever, and as we age, our health begins to deteriorate. We suffer from all sorts of ailments, from cancers to metabolic diseases, such as diabetes. Could fungi heal us?\"</p><p>\"Oh, dear human, you surely know that many medicines are produced with the use of fungi. Baker's yeast, which you have been using for years to make bread, wine and beer, is also used in micro-factories.\"</p><p>\"That is true. We discovered the genome <em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</em>, which allowed us to understand many biological processes. The similarities between human and fungal cells are staggering. This species of yeast is a model organism, commonly used in scientific research. We can even use yeast to produce insulin, a hormone that is indispensable in treating diabetes, one of our civilization's diseases.\"</p><p>\"I am proud of you humans. But remember that you have brought upon yourselves so many of those problems that you are so proud of fixing.\"</p><p>\"You're right, and many of them remain unsolved.\"</p><p>\"I won't tell you not to worry, but do not abandon hope. We fungi are very fond of Russian literature. One of us, the chaga mushroom that grows on birches, is the protagonist of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's novel<em> Cancer Ward</em>. An infusion made of this arboreal growth has incredibly potent healing abilities: it regulates blood pressure, relieves stomach ulcers, and it can even stop the development of some neoplastic cells. It is also used to treat HIV-positive patients.\"</p><p>\"I have read this book, and I'd hardly consider the chaga its main character.\"</p><p>\"Do you want our help or not?\"</p><p>\"I'm sorry.\"</p><p>\"It doesn't matter. Our time is almost up. I can feel the serotonin receptors in your body are almost depleted. In a few moments from now, we will no longer be able to communicate. But do take these leaflets with you, they contain some useful information and interesting facts. Whether you choose to use them and save our shared home or not, is your decision. Goodbye, human, and remember: we are always with you, inside you, and around you. Farewell!\"</p><p>*</p><h3></h3><br/><p>When I came to, I was lying in a beautiful forest clearing, a handful of leaflets in my fist. The mycelium's hyphae, which seemed to have coiled around my body, were now receding back into the depths of the fungal world. The clearing looked like an endlessly pulsating mandala, in which the fate of our planet was written. It is up to us whether and how we read them. Fungi are a vast, diverse kingdom, and scientists will need many more years to explore them. They have the potential to solve a number of issues that haunt our civilization. Will we accept the helping stem that they are offering?</p><p>For a few more minutes, I daydreamed. I pondered the challenges that loom over humanity. The thoughtless destruction of our environment. Of the natural magic that seems to be the key to the door of perception and survival. Then I heard the voices of my friends and of the fungi that live within them calling me. They didn't want to believe my story, but I very much hope that at least some of the fungal wisdom can seep through and into the thallus of <em>Homo sapiens</em>. After all, they gave me leaflets!</p><h3><em>LEAFLETS</em></h3><h3>Decontamination of flat surfaces</h3><p>Another nuclear reactor failure? Are the usual cleaning methods not good enough? Is your kitchen covered in radioactive ash? Or perhaps only cockroaches have survived, and you don't know whom you should call for help? Try the slimy spike-cap!</p><p>This inconspicuous clammy mushroom is capable of absorbing huge amounts of the radioactive isotope caesium-137, thus immobilizing it. The mushrooms can then be picked and burned in a controlled environment, creating radioactive ash, which enables a much easier way of storing or further processing. The concentration of caesium-137 in the slimy spike-cap can be up to 10,000 times higher than in the environment around it. So put on your hazmat suit and go sporulate some mushrooms.</p><h3>Psylololo</h3><p>Psst! Looking for some mystical experiences? Fancy feeling at one with nature and the shamans that surround you? Or maybe you're after vivid, colourful hallucinations? Come and join the <em>Psilocybe</em> circle, where colours have flavours, and all existential dread fades away!</p><p>Psilocybin, produced by our clever little brothers, has been known to humanity since the dawn of time. It is suspected to have contributed to the development of human consciousness and to have helped shape our spirituality, leading to the creation of religion. Today, it is used mostly for recreational purposes and in <a href=\"https://przekroj.pl/en/society/leaving-your-ego-behind-tomasz-stawiszynski\" target=\"_blank\">therapy.</a> They say that once the door of perception is open and we see things as they really are, everything else will fall into place. We don't promise that we can save the world, but it's worth giving us a chance. Under specialist supervision, of course!</p><h3></h3><br/><h3>Mushroom meat</h3><p>Are animal-borne diseases giving your civilization grief again? Has factory farming finally been recognized as animal violence? Perhaps you disagree with the concept of using animals as a source of protein in your diet, but you cannot imagine life without a tasty burger? The answer is already here: Quorn, the meat substitute made of <em>Fusarium venenatum</em>!</p><p>This spelling nightmare is, in fact, a delicious mushroom that grows in a sterile bioreactor, where it needs glucose and nitrogen to grow, and is later enriched with vitamins and mineral compounds. The final product is rich in proteins and fibre, has very little saturated fats, and has an exceptionally low track record of allergic reactions. On top of it, Quorn's carbon footprint is 80% lower than beef's. So far, the mushroom is known mainly in the West, but its popularity is growing fast – we can expect to see it on our plates sooner rather than later.</p><h3>Will work for food</h3><p>Reliable and hardworking fungus is looking for employment as polyethene waste utilizer. The issue of excessive amounts of plastic waste in the environment is prevalent, and humans are still looking for new ways to utilize them. My brother <em>Aspergillus terreus</em><em> </em>and I, <em>A. sydowii</em>, will happily take it upon ourselves to solve this pressing issue. Can work under challenging conditions with no special equipment required – we produce all of our enzymatic instruments ourselves, and they are perfect for softening and decomposing polymers. We would also like to use this opportunity to recommend the services of our good friend the oyster mushroom, who specializes in the production of environmentally-friendly biodegradable materials that could soon replace the outdated plastics. Feel free to get in touch.</p><h3>Yeast looking for eukaryote</h3><p>I am one of the best-known organisms on the planet, so how come we haven't met yet? Tired of sexless germination, I am looking for the possibility of genetic recalibration to enrich my genome and establish a stable romantic relationship.</p><p>My full name is <em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</em>, although I prefer to be called yeast. My career in the baking industry took off back in the times of the pharaohs. I'm still in touch with my friends and acquaintances in that part of the world, so if we get to know each other better, we can go for an exotic trip with a local guide. The baking business turned out to be very lucrative, but I didn't see it as much of a challenge, which pushed me to keep expanding my horizons. Maintaining my signature freshly-baked bread scent, I tried my hand at alcohol fermentation. But don't think me some shady moonshiner! I am a master of biochemical transformations, which I can prove with my vast portfolio of carbohydrates that I change into energy and ethanol. I'm comfortable with oxygen, but oxygen-free environments are also perfectly fine.</p><p>Being a fungus of success, I could never sit back for too long. I decided to try my hand at science next. I was hired as a model organism – not that I had to try very hard, considering my impressive skill set. A single-cell organism capable of growing in all kinds of conditions, a master of mitosis, who easily adapts to molecular modifications, has a lot in common – genetically at least – with more complex eukaryotes, including humans. In short, I am your perfect candidate. My academic interests include synthesizing medicines and hormones, ageing research, unveiling the secrets of cellular divisions and their accompanying DNA repairs, and intensification of mitochondrial mysteries. Lately I have become an avid fan of astrobiology, having visited the circumterrestrial orbit, and am planning a flight to the heliocentric orbit next. And while my genetic information isn't exactly a scientific enigma, I still have a delicious secret or two to share. If you think you might be interested, swipe right. We'll have a pastry, brew some wine, and if there's a spark, we can try some conjugation.</p><p><em>Translated from <a href=\"https://przekroj.pl/nauka/mysli-maslaka-tomasz-sitarz\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">the Polish</a> by Aga Zano</em></p><p>Reprinted with permission of <a href=\"https://przekroj.pl/en/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Przekrój</a>.

Art object</h3><br/><p>Chances are, this is an art object. The shiny \"monolith\" appears to be bolted to the ground and made of metal. It also seems to be fastened with rivets, rather being a uniform block of more unexplainable production origin. Deserts are great places for unusual installations as has been evidenced by past art projects that you can discover wandering through the ghost towns and faraway canyons of Nevada, California, Utah, and New Mexico. Certainly, an artist with a sense of humor and an appreciation of Kubrick's genius could have installed such \"sculpture\" in hopes of exactly what is happening right now–viral fame.</p><p>On the other hand, there is evidence, courtesy of eagle-eyed <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/jzkpad/helicopter_pilot_finds_strange_monolith_in_remote/gdg9qfi?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3\" target=\"_blank\">Google Earth sleuths</a>, that the object appeared in that location (somewhere near <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cany/index.htm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Canyonlands National Park</a>) in 2015-2016. So it's possibly been there for a few years. Would an artist have placed it there so long ago with the aim of having this type of success eventually?</p><p>A gallery owner <a href=\"https://www.9news.com.au/world/utah-monolith-desert-mystery-solved-john-mccracken-sculptor-artist-2001-a-space-odyssey/0bae1a27-5bd2-451e-90a6-393928d9ed02\" target=\"_blank\">claimed</a> the work may be a tribute to the late artist John McCracken, who created similar-looking objects before he died in 2011. McCracken was part of the Light and Space movement with such artists as James Turrell, and was known to make his sculptures from plywood forms that were coated with fiberglass and polyester resin.</p><p>While the theory that the monolith was the work of a McCracken aficionado (or the artist himself) may hold some water due to the object's similarity, the fact that the artist died so long ago and the lack of clear incentive for anyone to have planted this years ago only to reveal it now work against this theory.</p><h3></h3><br/><img class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"412ac8b09b2bb68db9044a05e8409b12\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"83773\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDg0MTk1Ny9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY1NjIyNzk4MH0.kXiB-m0-0naGTd2O-J4rvLpiBC1mPd5Zk3DBsVzFSRI/img.jpg?width=980\"/><h3></h3><br/><span class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"5088cb6eab21fcb02f5a163642e6de83\" style=\"display:block;position:relative;padding-top:56.25%;\"><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"auto\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/U4ldSYYtE-I?rel=0\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;\" width=\"100%\"></iframe></span><p>Another Utah desert art object.</p><h3>2. Alien evolutionary device </h3><br/><p>Certainly, explaining the monolith as an art installation may make the most sense at this point, but its resemblance to the famous object from Kubrick's epic \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" can't help but bring some science-fiction scenarios to our minds.</p><p>In the film, the perfect black slab was discovered by a group of prehistoric apes. After finding the slab, the apes seemed to have developed the ability to utilize found objects like bones as tools and weapons. The film suggests that finding the monolith had an evolutionary impact on the apes, perhaps serving as \"the missing link\" that propelled humans from being lower-end primates to the intellectual powerhouses they are today.</p><p><span></span>Later in the film, after fast-forwarding thousands of years into the future, such an object is discovered on the moon by human astronauts. Using the writer Arthur C. Clarke's short story <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sentinel_(short_story)\" target=\"_blank\">\"The Sentinel\"</a> as its inspiration, the film's narrative suggests that alien civilizations are responsible for these objects which potentially serve as beacons that may still be transmitting signals back to whoever created them while also possibly being responsible for fostering evolution throughout the Universe.</p><p>Could the Utah object be serving just such a function? While 2020 has offered very inconsistent evidence of human intelligence, a device from a benevolent alien race that can make us all smarter might be just what we need. </p><p>Or it could portend the exact opposite and be the one thing that will hasten our demise.</p><h3></h3><br/><span class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"2178845abc1a10c7b869e2f6201d5db7\" style=\"display:block;position:relative;padding-top:56.25%;\"><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"auto\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cHWs3c3YNs4?rel=0\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;\" width=\"100%\"></iframe></span><h3>3. Alien probe</h3><br/><p>Besides having some specific impact on the inhabitants of planet Earth, the monolith could \"just\" be an extraterrestrial probe, sent here to learn about our ways. Would placing it in the middle of Utah desert be the best place to probe humanity? If the object was part of many such probes being sent all over the cosmos, it's possible the advanced alien overlord wannabes may not know specifically we are here and are just sending these everywhere they can. It's similar to when humans send probes to places like Mars and assume there's no life there just because the rover landed in the middle of a desert.</p><h3>A closer look: the Utah monolith</h3><br/><blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned=\"\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CH_212pAKpr/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"13\" style=\" background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:540px; min-width:326px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);\"><div style=\"padding:16px;\"> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CH_212pAKpr/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=loading\" style=\" background:#FFFFFF; line-height:0; padding:0 0; text-align:center; text-decoration:none; width:100%;\" target=\"_blank\"> <div style=\" display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center;\"> <div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;\"></div> <div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center;\"> <div style=\" background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;\"></div> <div style=\" background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 60px;\"></div></div></div><div style=\"padding: 19% 0;\"></div> <div style=\"display:block; height:50px; margin:0 auto 12px; width:50px;\"></div><div style=\"padding-top: 8px;\"> <div style=\" color:#3897f0; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:550; line-height:18px;\"> View this post on Instagram</div></div><div style=\"padding: 12.5% 0;\"></div> <div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; margin-bottom: 14px; align-items: center;\"><div> <div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(0px) translateY(7px);\"></div> <div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; height: 12.5px; transform: rotate(-45deg) translateX(3px) translateY(1px); width: 12.5px; flex-grow: 0; margin-right: 14px; margin-left: 2px;\"></div> <div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(9px) translateY(-18px);\"></div></div><div style=\"margin-left: 8px;\"> <div style=\" background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 20px; width: 20px;\"></div> <div style=\" width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 2px solid transparent; border-left: 6px solid #f4f4f4; border-bottom: 2px solid transparent; transform: translateX(16px) translateY(-4px) rotate(30deg)\"></div></div><div style=\"margin-left: auto;\"> <div style=\" width: 0px; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-right: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(16px);\"></div> <div style=\" background-color: #F4F4F4; flex-grow: 0; height: 12px; width: 16px; transform: translateY(-4px);\"></div> <div style=\" width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-left: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(-4px) translateX(8px);\"></div></div></div> <div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center; margin-bottom: 24px;\"> <div style=\" background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 224px;\"></div> <div style=\" background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 144px;\"></div></div></a><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CH_212pAKpr/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=loading\" style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none;\" target=\"_blank\">A post shared by Dave Sparks (@heavydsparks)</a><br/></div></blockquote> <script async=\"\" src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"></script><h3>4.

But sometimes geographical acquaintance intersects with narrative quaintness, especially when the topic is very specific. As in this beautifully detailed map of \"Medical Events in North America,\" as bizarre as it is instructive.</p>\n<p>In the manner of a medieval miniature, it illuminates the topography of America with simplified, symbolic representations of the persons, institutions and events that have shaped medical history. That makes for some interesting discoveries. </p>\n<p>For example, whatever our feelings about Columbus, we are familiar with him via his signature achievement. However, few will have heard of Dr. Diego Alvarez Chanca of Seville, physician to the king and queen of Spain, and here seen accompanying the intrepid and/or invidious Genovese on his second voyage to America (on the ship painted in the bottom right corner).</p>\n<h3>Medical progress</h3>\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\\u200bExcerpt from 'Medical Events in North America' (1950), a map depicting major figures, institutions and events in the medical history of North America.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"bd1bd95d3c6350ba646865d42805e5e7\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"d77d2\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDg0MzYyMC9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYwNzA5NTM2NX0.GfGs1djKzW0GEzyCW-M4aEhKZma8uhk_UOYgNkcjVrU/img.png?width=980\" />\n<p>While on Hispaniola in 1493, Chanca cured Columbus from an attack of malaria – quite probably the first application of western medicine in the western hemisphere. </p>\n<p>For a good while, Spain remains the motor of medical progress in North America, with the publication in Mexico of \"Opera Medicinalia,\" the first medical book printed in the Americas (1570), and just 10 years later, the establishment of the first university chair of medicine in the New World, also in Mexico. </p>\n<p>Circa 1760, Junipero Serra prevented and controlled an outbreak of scurvy in California with the use of citrus juice – doing so 34 years before the British Navy struck upon the same idea. The Spanish padre is shown holding up oversized slices of oranges, dripping with healing sap. </p>\n<p>Soon thereafter, the initiative–medical and otherwise–is seized by the Anglos on the East Coast.</p>\n<h3>Remembering the pioneers</h3>\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\\u200bExcerpt from 'Medical Events in North America' (1950), a map depicting major figures, institutions and events in the medical history of North America.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"8a4ca544b5cb8fd79cfef0462bb43540\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"0a976\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDg0MzYxOS9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYzNzA3NTQ4Mn0.AwsGe5Oz-A4RHP-ZcrhI97mcn4xaeaADA53_toOpYoo/img.png?width=980\" />\n<p>Many of the achievements detailed on this map were truly revolutionary, helping to elevate the state of medical science to the heights it has reached today. But, as the legend of the map says, \"(t)he names of the prime-movers of science disappear gradually in a general fusion, and the more a science advances, the more impersonal and detached it becomes.\"</p>\n<p>So it's nice to see remembered here, among other pioneers:<br /></p>\n<ul>\n <li>Dr. Howard Taylor Ricketts (1871-1910), from near Missoula, who demonstrated the tick-transmission of Rocky Mountain spotted fever and died of Mexican typhus during the investigation and demonstration of the disease.</li>\n <li>Dr. J.C. Otto (1774-1844), from Philadelphia, who established haemophilia as a clinical entity.</li>\n <li>Sir Frederick Banting, working at Toronto University Medical School, who assisted by Charles Best managed to isolate insulin and succeeded in manufacturing it in 1922.

MacLeod, he received the Nobel Prize in 1923. </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarantine Enforcement Act</h3>\n<br><img alt=\"\\u200bExcerpt from 'Medical Events in North America' (1950), a map depicting major figures, institutions and events in the medical history of North America.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"7541fec6e98568cb685ab31e45559eb9\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"af0ac\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDg0MzYxOC9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY2Njc4NDg4NX0.2FOxQGAcwiodMmgf_za16AM8lULURhXN12W8SGShTJ4/img.png?width=980\" /><p>Several institutions are singled out as beacons of medical progress, notably</p>\n <ul> \n  <li>hospitals like Massachusetts General Hospital, Johns Hopkins Hospital, the Mayo Clinic;</li>\n  <li>educational centers of excellence such as Harvard Medical School, the Transylvania University Medical School and Jefferson Medical College; and </li>\n  <li>associations such as the State Boards of Health (first one established in 1869 in Massachusetts) and the American Medical Association (founded in Chicago).</li>\n </ul><p>Among the achievements mentioned on the map with resonance for our own pandemic times are the Quarantine Enforcement Act, passed by Congress as early as 1799, and the stamping out, in 1905 in New Orleans of an \"epidemic of yellow fever (…) by U.S. Public Health Service.\"Produced in 1950 and reflecting on earlier times, the map is dominated by white males.</p>The exceptions proving the rule are \n <ul>\n  <li>Dr. Hideyo Noguchi (1876-1928), who was associated with the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research and who in 1911 discovered the agent of syphilis as the cause of progressive paralytic disease; </li>\n  <li>Dr. Elizabeth Blackwell (1821-1910), the first woman in America to receive the degree of doctor in medicine, who together with Marie Zakrzewska established the first training school for nurses in America; and </li>\n  <li>a procession of slaves owned by Washington and Jefferson, standing in line to get inoculated for smallpox.</li>\n </ul><h3>Curious cases</h3><br /><img alt=\"\\u200bExcerpt from 'Medical Events in North America' (1950), a map depicting major figures, institutions and events in the medical history of North America.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"fe40428b6ab3a177f8750fc6511e02e0\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"b1eaa\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDg0MzYxNy9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYwODkzODUwMH0.W0q3XU5ZN82nrmgAldQfFkiUFDLX7Y92n1QGJy0UwyQ/img.png?width=980\" /><p>Few of the events and achievement mentioned on this map have made it into general public knowledge, with two possible exceptions. </p><p><span></span>One is \"the American Crowbar Case\", an 'extraordinary medical incident' mentioned in a note stuck to the East Coast: \"In 1848, an explosion propelled a 3 ½ ft. crowbar through the head of Phineas T.

But eventually the situation is resolved to the satisfaction of both parties: \"Beaumont gets (Mr. St. Martin) commissioned as sergeant to keep him during experiments.\"</p><p>One of the more familiar names on the map is that of Dr. Walter Reed, but mainly because he is now synonymous for the Army Medical Center named after him. The map reveals why he became famous enough for that honor:</p><p>In Cuba, Dr. Walter Reed (1851-1902) proved, together with Dr. Jesse W.

</li></ul><hr/><h3></h3><br/><p>As the holiday season approaches, tens of millions of Americans will not be seeing their families or loved ones this year. On the flip side, tens of millions will travel locally, nationally, and even internationally (where they can get in). The reality of \"two Americas\" has wedged itself into the conversation of coronavirus dangers, which we can see clearly in our travel patterns.</p><p>Few questions have inflamed the national consciousness this year as \"Are lockdowns necessary?\" and \"Should we close our borders?\" A new study, published in the appropriately named journal Chaos, dissects this issue by looking at migration patterns. </p><p>In a <a href=\"https://publishing.aip.org/publications/latest-content/in-a-pandemic-migration-away-from-dense-cities-more-effective-than-closing-borders/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u>simulation study</u></a> that included 10,000 iterations, Spanish researcher Massimiliano Zanin and Italian researcher David Papo argue that moving away from densely-populated urban regions is far more effective in stopping the spreading of disease than closing borders. </p><p>The authors wanted to know if banning travel is the ideal way of stopping the spread of disease. While it seems to be a commonsense approach to some—stop mobility patterns and the virus won't spread—the authors point to research that suggests allowing for some travel actually hinders infection rates. Of course, it depends on <em>where </em>people travel—or, in this case, move.</p><p>Regardless, a smart flow of traffic turns out to be a better solution than an outright ban on travel. </p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">\"Our results confirm that, under certain conditions, allowing individuals to move from regions of high to low infection rates may turn out to have a positive effect on aggregate; such positive effect is nevertheless reduced if a directional flow is allowed.\"</p><p>Naturally, when we think of restrictions, we consider international travel bans. This pandemic played out differently, however, with regional bans enforced as well. Of course, putting restrictions on regions with low infection rates—this happened in the United States, Italy, and Spain, for example—has the potential of increasing the spread of the virus there, but the authors were more interested in how the entire system operates. </p><h3></h3><br/><img class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"8c646a64aee59c61010f6a5468f2e27d\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"19062\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDc5NjQ2NS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYwNzUzMDI1Nn0.LW6gbWNewf-ypQEZXpPTjgkYsF9s6skKVfrRS8D_zg8/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C112%2C0%2C112&height=700\"/><p>The author realizes this model has limitations. Their focus was purely on population densities. Ideally, mobility during a pandemic coincides with public health measures, such as wearing a mask, washing your hands, and self-quaranting—factors that differ radically depending on what region you happen to be in. </p><p>While their modeling is hypothetical, it does track with real-world migration patterns. A mass exodus has been <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/30/nyregion/nyc-suburbs-housing-demand.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u>occurring from New York City</u></a>, for example. The reasons for so many people fleeing are manifold, but the pandemic certainly catalyzed the migration. Similar trends are occurring in <a href=\"https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2020/09/23/residents-moving-out-of-california-on-the-rise/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Los Angeles</u></a> and <a href=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/Yes-people-are-leaving-San-Francisco-After-15635160.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u>San Francisco</u></a>.</p><p>In their paper, Zanin and Papo wonder if forced relocation, from high-density to low-density regions, could be proactively enforced. Of course, there would be political pushback for initiating such measures, though it appears it could impact the spread of disease as well. </p><p>The authors also note that their model does not take into account the impact on regional health care systems, which, at least in America, are often not equipped to handle population increases. And they recognize the political concern—hypothetical modeling does not necessarily take ethical considerations into question. </p><p>That said, this is and will remain a political issue. As Zanin <a href=\"https://publishing.aip.org/publications/latest-content/in-a-pandemic-migration-away-from-dense-cities-more-effective-than-closing-borders/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u>says</u></a>, the success of any pandemic response lies in the cooperation between national and regional governments looking at their country as a whole, as well as considering the impact of their actions on the rest of the planet. </p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">\"Collaboration between different governments and administrations is an essential ingredient towards controlling a pandemic, and one should consider the possibility of small-scale sacrifices to reach a global benefit.\"</p><p>--</p><p><em>Stay in touch with Derek on <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/derekberes\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/DerekBeresdotcom\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a>.

But despite it's omnipresence, there's much we have still to learn about the fateful combination of hydrogen and oxygen atoms that comprises this near-magical substance. Now a new study proves water can have two different liquid states, in one of its most unusual properties.</p><p>The research, carried out by an international team of researchers, involved sophisticated experiments with x-ray lasers and computer simulations. The team, led by chemical physics professor Anders Nilsson from Sweden's Stockholm University, also included CUNY professor Nicolas Giovambattista. He explained in a press release that while it's been proposed about 30 years ago that water may have two different liquid states, this \"counterintuitive hypothesis\" was been hard to prove, due to the complexity of the experiments necessary. Ice tends to form at the conditions when the two liquids should exist. </p><h3></h3><br/><p>The liquid state of water that we all know and encounter in our daily lives is how water behaves at regular temperatures – around 25 degrees Celsius (77 F) . What the new study showed is that at low temperatures of around -63 degrees C (-81 F), water can be found in two states: a low-density liquid at low pressures, and a high-density liquid at high pressures.</p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">\"What was special was that we were able to X-ray unimaginably fast, before the water froze, and could observe how one liquid transformed to the other\", <a href=\"https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-11/su-tlo111920.php#:~:text=Using%20x%2Dray%20lasers%2C%20researchers,a%20density%20difference%20of%2020%25.\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> professor Nilsson. </p><p>The researchers found that the difference in density between the two liquids was about<strong> 20 percent.</strong> A thin interface would form, given the right conditions, to separate the two kinds of water without mixing them.

With a name like that, he can't <em>not</em> be geographically inclined. And for proof that he knows his numbers and likes his triangles, look no further than the latest entry on <a href=\"https://tomalps.github.io/ta_blog/\" target=\"_blank\">Tom's Data Blog</a>, titled \"What is the Most Triangular Country?\"</p>\n<p>It's not the first question that we'd expect to see flowering in that weird and wild frontier zone between abstract mathematics and applied geography. Nor the second one. No, those would be, respectively: What is the Roundest Country? And What is the Squarest Country? <br /></p>\n<p>If we had to take a guess, the answers to those two would be: Lesotho, and Turkey. Turns out we would be wrong on both accounts – because those questions have already been answered. As we discussed some time ago, Sierra Leone is the roundest country in the world, and Egypt is the squarest one (see #<a href=\"https://bigthink.com/strange-maps/sierra-leone-is-the-worlds-roundest-country-and-egypt-the-squarest-one\" target=\"_blank\">926</a>). And, weirdly, the Vatican is both the world's fourth roundest and second most rectangular country.</p>\n<h3>Defining 'triangularity'</h3>\n<br><img alt=\"\\u200bRanked: the world's squarest (left) and roundest (right) countries.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"f9a9b6d50fdac2307bb16602eb7aaf27\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"729ce\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDc5NzQ5NC9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYwNzczOTYxMX0.dq2gbIDupZo2GvVrA4i8h2nv01KPlLQjnzNPmX_D_XA/img.png?width=980\" /><p>As it turns out, Lesotho is only the 36th roundest out of a total of 206 countries and territories, and Turkey only the 15th boxiest. So we were off by quite a bit. But ask us which is the most triangular nation on earth, and we can't even picture a likely candidate. </p><p><span></span>This is where Mr Alps's mathematical skills kick in. Inspired as he was by the pioneering work by <a href=\"https://gciruelos.com/what-is-the-roundest-country...\" target=\"_blank\">Gonzalo Ciruelos</a> (on sovereign circularity) and <a href=\"https://pappubahry.com/misc/rectangles/\" target=\"_blank\">David Barry</a> (on state-based squareness), he decided to test the world's countries and territories for their conformity to the third-most-basic geometrical shape. </p><p><span></span>As he writes on his blog, \"the first step is to define mathematically what 'triangularity' means.\" For the full methodology, check Mr Alps's blog. And let's skip to the juicy bits. Out of the 196 countries listed in the Encyclopaedia Britannica, the most triangular country is...</p><p><em><span></span>(ripping open envelope)</em></p><p>… Nicaragua!</p><p>And yes, now that you mention it – we see it too. </p><h3>Triangles on flags</h3><br /><img alt=\"\\u200bThe five most triangular countries in the world: Nicaragua, Bosnia, Namibia, Mauritania and Bolivia.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"a9df70f30f586c1ff63cf529e1a6e47f\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"56f13\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDc5NzUwMy9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY2NzkwMzY5MH0.m60QEjRD6Sw6spqQNUPi0YrygvjMZljXU7wMprtcJoc/img.png?width=980\" /><p>On the 'triangularity' index devised by Mr Alps, which indicates maximum similarity between a country and a triangle, the Central American nation scores 0.918672. That is slightly better than the runner-up, Bosnia-Herzegovina. Although now that you mention it, that is a very triangular-looking country, too. </p><p><span></span>In fact, the Bosnians thought so themselves. The country's national flag features a triangle as an approximation of the nation's geographic shape. Weirdly, the Nicaraguan flag also features a triangle. By accident or design?</p><p><span></span>Mr Alps plotted the triangularity of each country. \"This shows that there is a quite gentle decrease in triangularity over the first 150 countries, followed by a sharp drop-off, seemingly due to countries that have multiple parts.\"</p><p><span></span>The least triangular country? The Marshall Islands. \"Hardly surprising, considering the country is a collection of tiny islands spread over a large area of ocean.\"</p><p><span></span>For the least triangular country that isn't a group of islands, we have to move up 16 places in the ranking to Vietnam at #180. The United States is also among the world's poorest performers when it comes to triangularity, stuck in 157th place between Laos and Mexico. </p><p>How well is your country performing in the global triangularity ranking?

It finds that the same part of our brain that hungers for food after a day of fasting longs for other people after isolation. </p><h3>\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\nPeople sometimes crave socialization, literally. </h3><br/><p> Forty participants underwent 10 hours of either social isolation or fasting before being placed in an MRI machine. Those who fasted had their brains imaged while viewing pictures of food; those emerging from isolation viewed photos of socializing people. <strong><br/> <br/> </strong>The areas of the brain related to hunger pains, reward, and movements, the substantia nigra pars compacta and ventral tegmental area (SN/VTA), are also associated with cravings for food or addictive substances. When those who fasted viewed images of food, these regions of their brains lit up. Most interestingly, the same brain regions lit up when those who had been isolated for 10 hours saw pictures of other people socializing. <br/> <br/> Test subjects also filled out questionnaires during and after the fasting and isolation periods. Not only did this confirm that people felt cravings for what they had missed, but that the effect was similar in both cases.  </p><p>They also showed that very hungry people were less responsive to images of socializing, suggesting that \"hanger,\" the state of being irritable as a result of hunger, is a demonstrable <a href=\"https://www.insider.com/loneliness-and-hunger-have-similar-effects-on-the-brain-study-2020-11\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">state</a>.  </p><h3>\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\nHow can I use this information? I’m asking for a friend. </h3><br><p> The obvious takeaway is that it is perfectly normal to feel a need for interaction with others after an extended bout of isolation. Our brains treat some form of interaction as a basic need that must be met. While not shown as clearly in humans, not getting these needs often drives mice to <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29334694/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">stress ea</a><a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29334694/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">t</a>, a finding that makes a great deal of sense in light of these new findings. <br/> </p><p>Exactly how we can meet the need for socialization outside of just meeting up with people (a tricky proposition at the time of writing) remains up for debate. Anybody who has tried a Zoom party during the pandemic can attest to it just not being as nice as seeing friends in person. <br/> <br/> The study's authors are aware of this issue and note that:<br/> <br/> \"A vital question is how much, and what kinds of, positive social interaction is sufficient to fulfill our social needs and thus eliminate the neural craving response. Technological advances offer incessant opportunities to be virtually connected with others, despite physical separations. Yet, some have argued that using social media only exacerbates subjective feelings of isolation.<sup>\"</sup><br/> </p><p>Unfortunately, the study cannot offer us an answer to this question just yet. </p><h3>Like always, there are limitations to this study. </h3><br><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"430\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/sgxMsgDWnAU\" width=\"730\"></iframe><p> This study involved 40 participants. While its essential finding is likely to be generally applicable, exactly how applicable it is to the broader population cannot be known with certainty from such a small group. The participants were also healthy, well-connected young adults who might react to various problems differently than other demographic groups.  </p><p>Their tendency to do so while being the focus of endless studies on psychology is a well-recorded problem. <br/> <br/> Likewise, the fact that the participants knew they would only be isolated for 10 hours may have impacted how they reacted to the isolation—it is often easier to endure something when you know precisely when it will end.  </p><p>Getting around that in future experiments may prove impossible. From an ethical standpoint, it would be difficult to structure an experiment on humans predicated on the idea that they will be kept isolated from all social interaction indefinitely. <br/> <br/> Lastly, while all of the participants were quite hungry after 10 hours, there were enough variations in how lonely people felt after isolation to suggest a more significant variance in need for socialization than in demand for food.

But today, they have a chance to make a spectacular return.</p><hr/>For decades, die-hard fans of airships have had to accept the fact that their beloved airborne vessels had no chance of making their way back to air travel routes. The ever more technologically advanced aeroplanes are more comfortable and practical than these sluggish giants. Yet the situation changed over a year ago when people in Sweden started talking about 'flight shame'. Along with the heightened fear of global warming, calculations were being made that, for example, a Boeing 747 emits as much carbon dioxide into the air during 24 hours of flight as 250 passenger cars riding uninterruptedly for a year. Although aeroplanes are responsible for only 4% of the CO2 that goes into the atmosphere in the territory of the European Union, 'flight shame' became a hit. The Green parties, especially in Germany, started to bang the alarm that in Europe 45% of all flights are operated on routes shorter than 500 kilometres. The first airlines have just embraced this new trend; at the end of 2019, Dutch airline KLM announced that as of March they will replace flight connections from Amsterdam to Brussels with train routes, together with railway operator Thalys. Likewise, Air France – part of the same holding company as KLM – announced a New Year's resolution that by 2021, the French air carrier will reduce its domestic flights by 15%.<h3></h3><br/><p>This trend brings with it the unique opportunity for the much more environmentally-friendly passenger airships to make a triumphant comeback. Much like they did 100 years ago, today's airships move with the help of propeller-type turbines powered by petrol or diesel engines. However, they emit considerably less CO2 than jet engines. On shorter distances, their speed, on average nine times lower than passenger jets, does not make that much of a difference. Especially since an airship can pick up passengers even in the centre of a metropolis.</p><p>Working on refining such a solution is the British company Hybrid Air Vehicles (HAV), founded in 2007. For the past decade, its engineers have been fine-tuning the Airlander 10 project. Standing behind the name is a 92-metres-long vehicle that combines the benefits of an aeroplane and helicopter. It can land and take off from practically any location, take 14 tons of cargo or 60 passengers on board, and then fly at a speed of 140 kilometres per hour for up to five days without having to land. In September 2019 in London, HAV representatives signed a contract with the US company Vertex Aerospace LLC, thereby opening up the possibility of supplying Airlander 10 to the US Department of Defense. Soon after that, the management of HAV announced it was launching preparations for the development of a passenger model powered by electric engines. It is indeed this type of drive unit that could ultimately tip the scales and let these huge machines, the development of which was halted by aeroplanes 100 years ago, take to the skies once more.</p><h3></h3><br/><h3>A balloon with an engine</h3><p>The balloon designed and built by Joseph and Jacques Montgolfier never became a useful flying machine due to one fundamental drawback: the direction that it flew in was defined by the blowing wind. For several decades since the summer of 1783, when the brothers held a demonstration of their invention for King Louis XVI by sending a lamb, rooster and duck flying in the air, designers were not be able to overcome this challenge. Granted, there were designs of balloons equipped with sails or even propellers, yet the secret to success lay in a proper drive unit.</p><p>French designer Henri Jules Giffard was the first to recognize this. He managed to build a steam engine weighing a little over 100 kilograms that could be installed in the balloon's gondola. He attached his structure to a cigar-shaped balloon 44 metres in length and filled it with hydrogen. Then he loaded 150 kilograms of coke into the gondola and, on 24th September 1852, set out from Paris to Trappes. The flight proceeded in the direction chosen by Giffard, as the French inventor equipped the vehicle with a triangular sail serving the function of a rudder. Yet the flying giant proved to be helpless in the face of slightly stronger gusts of wind. And once again, the problem lay in the drive unit; to be able to squeeze additional power out of a steam engine, it had to be enlarged. That, in turn, meant that the balloon needed to be bigger to be able to lift the heavier load into the sky. But then the vessel would become even less controllable and vulnerable to the wind.</p><p>Numerous designers attempted to improve Giffard's masterpiece. An airship designed by two captains of the French Army, Charles Renard and Arthur Krebs, looked very promising. The propeller that pushed the vehicle forward was powered by an 8.5 horsepower electric engine, eight times more powerful than Giffard's steam engine. Thanks to the new drive unit, on 9th August 1884, <em>La France</em> was able to fly eight kilometres in 20 minutes, turn back and return to the place it started from, in spite of the wind. However, Krebs and Renard were not able to manage the issues created by lead acid batteries, as they were too heavy, inefficient and required constant recharging.</p><h3></h3><br/><h3>The flying count</h3><p>While French inventors were walking in circles, the Germans set off to conquer the heavens. At the end of the 19th century, Germany was producing the most sophisticated combustion engines in the world. The small yet powerful 28 horsepower engines from the Daimler factory caught the attention of Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin. In 1890, with his 50th birthday on his heels, General von Zeppelin decided to end his military career and engage in the construction of flying machines, thereby fulfilling the dreams of his youth. He caught the aeronautics bug in the US during the Civil War, when he flew in a balloon high above the battle fields as the envoy of the King of Württemberg. 25 years later, he started work on the construction of an innovative airship along with engineer Theodor Kobert. They drew inspiration from the ideas of Hungarian engineer David Schwartz, who had patented the design of an aerostat based on a stiff frame covered with a cotton or aluminium shell, which in turn concealed soft balloons filled with hydrogen.</p><p>The fulfilment of his dream proved to be a costly venture, and after eight years of struggling, Von Zeppelin founded the <em>Gesellschaft zur Förderung der Luftschiffahrt</em> in Stuttgart in 1898. In July 1900, on the coast of Lake Constance, he was able to present to shareholders and onlookers his enormous flying machine, the <em>Luftschiff Zeppelin (LZ 1)</em>. The cigar-shaped creation, which was 128 metres in length, majestically glided across the sky around 300 metres above the waters of the lake thanks to two Daimler engines. Following that success, and thanks to public fundraisers and lotteries, Von Zeppelin managed to collect 250,000 marks to build yet another airship, abbreviated the<em> LZ 2</em>. The count was expecting that the German army would buy it for 1.5 million marks, but the price proved to be prohibitively high. The army was initially not interested in the <em>LZ 3</em> model either, although it made 45 flights safely, covering an air distance of 4000 kilometres.</p><p>A breakthrough did not come until the matter of the high-profile catastrophe of the <em>LZ 4</em> airship appeared. The count had turned the <em>LZ 4</em> into a near masterpiece. The 136-metre-long cigar-shaped vehicle was divided into 17 chambers filled with hydrogen, and attached beneath it was a gondola for the pilots and mechanics, as well as a second luxury passenger gondola. Even King Wilhelm II of Württemberg, who had been persuaded to try the airship out in July of 1908, had no complaints about its level of comfort. After the marketing success, Count Zeppelin announced that his vehicle would make a 24-hour flight without landing, hoping to convince the head of the German army that airships were the perfect solution for attacking the deep hinterland of the enemy. However, on 5th August 1908, a storm forced the <em>LZ 4</em> pilot Hugon Eckener to land near the city of Echterdingen. There, a gust of the storm wind snapped the airship's tether and threw it to the ground; the hydrogen exploded and the machine burned to ashes.</p><p>That loss pushed Count Zeppelin's company to the brink of bankruptcy. When the news became widespread, the Germans spontaneously organized a fundraiser for the engineer, whom they were proud of. Soon, he received a sum of over six million marks. This capital allowed Zeppelin to found Luftschiffbau Zeppelin GmbH, a company that, in line with its name (<em>Luftschiffbau</em> means 'airship engineering'), specialized in the construction of airships. Financial aid was also promised by the Minister of War Karl von Einem, who was increasingly more interested in the combat potential of the flying machines.</p><h3></h3><br/><h3>Civil and bomber</h3><p>The mass participation of regular Germans in the fundraiser gave Von Zeppelin the idea that his airships could compete with train travel. In November 1909, he surprised the world by founding the <em>Deutsche Luftschiffahrts Aktiengesellschaft</em> (DELAG) passenger airline. DELAG transported the first 20,000 passengers for free, thereby promoting the trend for air travel, and after that he offered tickets for 200 marks. The amount was equivalent to average monthly wages in Germany at the time; nonethless, its flights were becoming more and more popular. On board the 12 DELAG airships, servicing routes connecting the 10 largest cities of the German Empire, you could travel in the company of aristocrats, politicians, millionaires, generals, or even members of the Imperial Family. In 1914, the airline proudly announced that it had transported 34,000 passengers, and that not one of them died during the flights. Users of highly unreliable aeroplanes could only dream of such statistics at the time.</p><p>So when World War I broke out, as the late Walter J. Boyne wrote in his book <em>The Influence of Air Power</em> <em>Upon History</em>, \"Germany was so convinced of the potential of dirigibles [...] that it allowed the Army and the Navy to develop their own airship fleets [...].\" Ferdinand von Zeppelin, now nearing 80 years of age, was at the height of his fame, while his factories were working at full capacity. Right after the airships, commonly referred to as Zeppelins, appeared over the front lines in France and Great Britain, they raised alarm. In September 1914, in an attempt to anticipate any actions of the enemy, the First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill planned a series of attacks of British bombers on airship bases in Cologne and Düsseldorf, and on an airship manufacturing plant in Friedrichshafen. Despite the great dedication of the airmen, the action brought little effect, as only one Zeppelin burned down on the ground when it was hit by a bomb. Yet the expected retaliation attacks did not take place right away. \"At a joint meeting September 1914, representatives of the Army and Navy decided that there were as yet too few airships to bomb England, and further, that they were inhibited by Kaiser Wilhelm's reluctance to bomb the homes of many of his royal relatives,\" Boyne explains. It wasn't until Germany realized enormous losses on the front that the monarch changed his mind.</p><p>\"The first attack took place on January 19-20, 1915, with two out of three Zeppelins – L 3 and L 4 – successfully reaching England,\" Boyne describes. <em>L 3</em> dropped over a dozen 50-kilogram bombs on Great Yarmouth, while <em>L 4</em>, led by Captain Magnus von Platen-Hallermund, nearly gave the German Emperor a heart attack. Its bombs fell onto Sandringham House, where the cousin of Wilhelm II, the British King George V, happened to be staying at the time. Luckily nothing happened to him, but the public were shocked by the fact that for the first time in 800 years, since the times of William the Conqueror, an enemy from the continent had launched a direct attack on the monarchs of England.</p><p>At first, the airships operated over the island with complete impunity. Rifle bullets shot from the ground were not able to pierce the duralumin sheeting of the vessels' hulls. In addition, Zeppelins flew at higher altitudes than fighter planes and were able to climb up more quickly, in spite of their large dimensions. For the first time ever in history, Lieutenant Reginald Warneford managed to shoot down the <em>L 37</em> airship, but this was only after he flew above it in a plane and dropped six bombs from the top. Therefore, the Germans used them even more boldly. \"All the fears seemed to be realised on the night of October 13-14 [1915], when five Zeppelins slashed across England, dropping almost two hundred bombs and killing seventy-one people and injuring another 128,\" Boyne reports.</p><h3></h3><br/><h3>The blind path of evolution</h3><p>\"Looking up the clear run of New Bridge Street and Farringdon Road I saw high in the sky a concentrated blaze of searchlights, and in its centre a ruddy glow which rapidly spread into the outline of a blazing airship. Then the search lights were turned off and the Zeppelin drifted perpendicularly in the darkened sky, a gigantic pyramid of flames, red and orange, like a ruined star falling slowly to earth,\" are the words reporter Michael MacDonagh noted in his journal entry dated 1st October 1916. \"It was so horribly fascinating that I felt spellbound – almost suffocated with emotion, ready hysterically to laugh or cry. When at last the doomed airship vanished from sight there arose a shout the like of which I never heard in London before – a hoarse shout of mingled execration, triumph and joy; a swelling shout that appeared to be rising from all parts of the metropolis, ever increasing in force and intensity,\" he added. A month earlier, right after midnight on 3rd September 1916, London experienced the 'Night of the Zeppelins', when as many as 16 dark cigars hovered over the British capital, each 200-metres long and each dropping bombs to the ground. They seemed to be mighty and impregnable, yet as a result of the wartime arms race, planes and anti-aircraft artillery was being perfected at an amazing pace. A few months down the line, all you needed to take down an airship was an accurately launched machine gun series with ammunition designed to puncture the aluminium shell, or a few artillery shells. When British fighter planes shot down 17 Zeppelins in 1917, the Germans backed out of the London bombings.</p><p>The bombs dropped by the airships killed 557 British subjects and caused material damage amounting to $7.5 million. Yet the construction of 17 Zeppelins cost $8.3 million, and over 300 crew members were lost. From a military and economic perspective, the balance was disastrous. Nevertheless, in the Versailles Treaty, the triumphant superpowers prohibited the production of airships in the Weimar Republic.</p><p>Fortunately, Ferdinand von Zeppelin did not live to see that day, as he had died in 1917. His successor at Luftschiffbau Zeppelin GmbH, Hugo Eckener, initiated long-term lobbying efforts in the US that lasted until 1922, when American President Warren G. Harding stated that it would be an excellent idea for Germany to pay out part of the war reparations due in brand new airships. London and Paris did not protest to this. In the meantime, engineers had developed a new generation of machines. The first <em>LZ 120</em> series airship 'Bodensee' had the shape of a 120-metre-long 'teardrop', which was able to fly at a speed of 130 kilometres per hour thanks to four Maybach engines with 245 horsepower each. An improved version of the 'Bodensee', the <em>LZ 127</em> 'Graf Zeppelin', was extended to 236 metres. As a result, it allowed engineers to achieve a significant increase in lift, to the point where in 1929, humanity could follow the flight of the 'Graf Zeppelin' around the world with fascination. At the time, the press was all over the topic of its comfortable cabins for 40 passengers, which were even equipped with separate toilets and showers with hot water, a luxurious restaurant and a lounge, indispensable for evening receptions.</p><p>But not too long after that, the factories of William E. Boeing in Seattle started to offer to airlines its innovative passenger aeroplane model, the <em>B 247</em>; it was a beautiful twin-engine machine able to fly at speeds of over 300 kilometres per hour. It provided a sound-proof cabin for 10 passengers with the possibility of controlling the temperature. But it didn't outbid the offer of luxurious airships just yet; the decisive factor in this new race was... gas. German engineers replaced the flammable hydrogen with the much safer helium. They had to buy it from the Americans though, as only they had the technology available to produce helium on an industrial level. When Hitler came to power in Germany, fears were increasingly expressed across the Atlantic that a fleet of combat airships could launch an unexpected attack on American cities and ports. To the great joy of Boeing, President Franklin D. Roosevelt introduced an embargo on the export of helium to the Third Reich. So Zeppelins would once again be filled with hydrogen. The explosion of hydrogen during a landing at the airport in Lakehurst (New Jersey) on 6th May 1937 destroyed the <em>LZ 129</em> 'Hindenburg'. The catastrophe, in which 35 people were burned alive, resounded to the point that potential air travel buffs lost all trust in airships. It wasn't such a great sacrifice for them though, as only a few months after the 'Hindenburg' had burned, Boeing offered them the four-engine <em>B 307</em> 'Stratoliner', the first passenger plane with a pressurized cabin that was able to fly at an altitude of nearly 8000m and had a range of 3800 kilometres. Airlines no longer needed the giant cigars. The army used them for third-rate patrol operations at sea and as barriers attached to cables to make it harder for bombers to attack cities.</p><p>That's how the age of the airship came to an end, but maybe not an indefinite end. According to the study concept by Hybrid Air Vehicles, the new generation vessels would be powered by electric engines supplied not only by energy from batteries, but also by energy from solar panels. That would allow the vehicle to embark on flights lasting several days continuously, not to mention neutrality for the natural environment. And that advantage can only gain importance in the very near future.</p><p><em>Translated from </em><a href=\"https://przekroj.pl/kultura/wieloryby-czystych-przestworzy-andrzej-krajewski\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>the Polish</em></a><em> by Mark Ordon</em></p><p>Reprinted with permission of <a href=\"https://przekroj.pl/en/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" style=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Przekrój</a>.

Rather, it is the process of trying to gain or share knowledge under challenging circumstances. </p><p>Currently, there are at least three common sources that, from my perspective, are leading to such exhaustion. But there are also ways to deal with them. </p><h3></h3><br/><h2>1. Uncertainty</h2><p>For many, this year has been full of uncertainty. In particular, the <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0141076820930665\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">coronavirus pandemic</a> has generated uncertainty about health, about best practices and about the future.</p><p>At the same time, Americans have faced <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/10/07/voters-anxiously-approach-an-unusual-election-and-its-potentially-uncertain-aftermath/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">uncertainty about the U.S. presidential election</a>: first due to delayed results and now over <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/23/us/politics/trump-power-transfer-2020-election.html?searchResultPosition=3\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">questions about a peaceful transition of power</a>.</p><p>Experiencing <a href=\"https://www.apa.org/topics/stress-uncertainty\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">uncertainty can stress most of us out</a>. People tend to prefer the planned and the predictable. Figures from 17th-century French philosopher <a href=\"http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/15537/1/Certainty%20and%20Explanation%20in%20Descartes%20HOPOS%20AcceptedFinal.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">René Descartes</a> to 20th-century Austrian philosopher <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/762159.On_Certainty\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Ludwig Wittgenstein</a> have recognized the significance of having certainty in our lives.</p><p>With information so readily available, people may be checking news sites or social media in hopes of finding answers. But often, people are instead greeted with more reminders of uncertainty.</p><h3></h3><br/><h2>2. Polarization</h2><p>Political polarization <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/robert-barrett-phd/the-stress-from-political-polarization-is-killing-us-slowly_a_23350469/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">is stressing many Americans out</a>.</p><p>As political scientist <a href=\"https://gvpt.umd.edu/facultyprofile/mason/lilliana\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Lilliana Mason</a> notes in her book, \"<a href=\"https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/U/bo27527354.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Uncivil Disagreement: How Politics Became Our Identity</a>,\" Americans have been increasingly dividing politically \"into two partisan teams.\"</p><p>Many writers have discussed the <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/extreme-political-polarization-weakens-democracy-can-the-us-avoid-that-fate-105540\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">negative effects of polarization</a>, such as how it can damage democracy. But discussions about the harms of polarization often overlook the toll polarization takes on our ability to gain and share knowledge.</p><p>That can happen in at least two ways.</p><p>First, as philosopher <a href=\"https://www.kevinvallier.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Kevin Vallier</a> has argued, there is a \"<a href=\"https://www.kevinvallier.com/reconciled/low-trust-exacerbates-polarization/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">causal feedback loop</a>\" between polarization and distrust. In other words, polarization and distrust fuel one another. Such a cycle can leave people feeling <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/opinion/gallup/284357/polarization-may-undermine-community-bonds-trust-others.aspx\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">unsure whom to trust or what to believe</a>.</p><p>Second, polarization can lead to <a href=\"https://time.com/5907318/polarization-2020-election/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">competing narratives</a> because in a deeply polarized society, as studies show, we can <a href=\"https://www.degruyter.com/view/journals/for/16/1/article-p47.xml\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">lose common ground</a> and tend to have less agreement.</p><p>For those inclined to take the views of others seriously, this can create additional cognitive work. And when the issues are heated or sensitive, this can create additional <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/09/190926073348.htm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">stress and emotional burdens</a>, such as sadness over damaged friendships or anger over partisan rhetoric.</p><h3></h3><br/><h2>3. Misinformation</h2><p>Viral misinformation is everywhere. This includes <a href=\"https://iop.harvard.edu/get-involved/study-groups/propaganda-today%E2%80%99s-american-politics\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">political propaganda in the United States</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/06/books/review/peter-pomerantsev-this-is-not-propaganda.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">around the world</a>.</p><p>People are also inundated with advertising and misleading messaging from private corporations, what philosophers <a href=\"http://cailinoconnor.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Cailin O'Connor</a> and <a href=\"http://jamesowenweatherall.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">James Owen Weatherall</a> have called \"<a href=\"https://heterodoxacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/062_Cailin_oConnor_How_False_Beliefs_Spread.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">industrial propaganda</a>.\" And in 2020, the public is also dealing with <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01452-z\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">misinformation about COVID-19</a>.</p><p>As chess grandmaster <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kasparov63/status/808750564284702720?lang=en\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Garry Kasparov put it</a>: \"The point of modern propaganda isn't only to misinform or push an agenda. It is to exhaust your critical thinking, to annihilate truth.\"</p><p>Misinformation is often exhausting by design. For example, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/coronavirus-plandemic-and-the-seven-traits-of-conspiratorial-thinking-138483\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">a video that went viral,</a> \"<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/tarahaelle/2020/05/08/why-its-important-to-push-back-on-plandemic-and-how-to-do-it/?sh=3e430c9e5fa3\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Plandemic</a>,\" featured a large number of false claims about COVID-19 in rapid succession. This flooding of misinformation in rapid succession, a tactic known as a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/9/26/13036258/donald-trump-debate-win-lies-preparation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gish gallop</a>, makes it challenging and time-consuming for fact checkers to refute the many falsehoods following one after another.</p><h3></h3><br/><h2>What to do?</h2><p>With all this uncertainty, polarization and misinformation, feeling tired is understandable. But there are things one can do.</p><p>The American Psychological Association suggests <a href=\"https://www.apa.org/topics/stress-uncertainty\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">coping with uncertainty</a> through activities like limiting news consumption and focusing on things in one's control. Another option is to work on becoming more <a href=\"https://pemachodronfoundation.org/product/comfortable-with-uncertainty-book/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">comfortable with uncertainty</a> through practices such as meditation and the cultivation of mindfulness.</p><p>To deal with polarization, consider communicating with the goal of <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/phpr.12624\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">creating empathetic understanding</a> rather than \"winning.\" Philosopher <a href=\"http://mjhannon.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Michael Hannon</a> describes empathetic understanding as \"the ability to take up another person's perspective.\"</p><p>As for limiting the spread of misinformation: Share only those news stories that you've read and verified. And you can prioritize outlets that meet high ethical <a href=\"https://www.spj.org/ethicscode.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">journalistic</a> or <a href=\"https://www.poynter.org/ifcn-fact-checkers-code-of-principles/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">fact-checking standards</a>.</p><p>These solutions are limited and imperfect, but that's all right. Part of resisting epistemic exhaustion is learning to live with the limited and imperfect. No one has time to vet all the headlines, correct all the misinformation or gain all the relevant knowledge. To deny this is to set oneself up for exhaustion.<img alt=\"The Conversation\" src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/149615/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic\"/></p><p><a href=\"https://theconversation.com/profiles/mark-satta-1173820\" target=\"_blank\">Mark Satta</a>, Assistant Professor of Philosophy, <em><a href=\"https://theconversation.com/institutions/wayne-state-university-989\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Wayne State University</a></em></p><p>This article is republished from <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Conversation</a> under a Creative Commons license.

But when we talk about human dignity, what do we mean?</p><h3>The inherent worth of all human beings</h3><br/><p>Human dignity is the inherent worth of each individual human being. Recognizing human dignity means respecting human beings' special value—value that sets us apart from other animals; value that is intrinsic and cannot be lost.</p>\n<p>Liberalism—the broad political philosophy that organizes society around liberty, justice, and equality—is rooted in the idea of human dignity. Liberalism assumes each of our lives, plans, and preferences have some unimpeachable value, not because of any objective evaluation or contribution to a greater good, but simply because they belong to a human being. We are human, and therefore deserving of a baseline level of respect. </p>\n<p>Because so many of us take human dignity for granted—just a fact of our humanness—it's usually only when someone's dignity is ignored or violated that we feel compelled to talk about it. </p>\n<p>But human dignity means more than the absence of violence, discrimination, and authoritarianism. It means giving individuals the freedom to pursue their own happiness and purpose—a freedom that can be hampered by restrictive social institutions or the tyranny of the majority. The liberal ideal of the good society is not just peaceful but also pluralistic: It is a society in which we respect others' right to think and live differently than we do.</p><h3>From the 19th century to today</h3><br/><img class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"9974c7bef3812fcb36858f325889e3c6\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"7ef38\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDg0ODU0My9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY1MTUwMzE4MX0.bu0D_0uQuyNLyJjfRESNhu7twkJ5nxu8pQtfa1w3hZs/img.png?width=980\"/><p>With <a href=\"https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?year_start=1800&year_end=2019&content=human+dignity&corpus=26&smoothing=3&direct_url=t1%3B%2Chuman%20dignity%3B%2Cc0\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Google Books Ngram Viewer</a>, we can chart mentions of human dignity from 1800-2019.</p><h3></h3><br/><img class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"0f2270501d92035c19cad5fc758b55e1\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"9a5d2\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDg0ODU0NS9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYxNjM0ODMzM30.BzxT9Y1Zg5nE-PuQ2enrBn8FXs3HauET23enIw9rH34/img.png?width=980\"/><p>We can also map human dignity against mentions of liberalism to see that discussion of human dignity increased with discussion of liberalism. </p><h3></h3><br/><p>Then we can search through individual mentions to find how human dignity was discussed and understood over the last 200 years.</p>\n<p>For example, German rabbi Dr. Samuel Hirsch gave a lecture in 1853 on \"<a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Advocate/s1ccAQAAMAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=%22human+dignity%22&pg=PA421&printsec=frontcover\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Religion of Humanity</a>\" in which he condemned slavery. \"That which we love in ourselves, our true human dignity, compels us to recognize and love the same human dignity in all others,\" Hirsh said. He wrote:</p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">If I can look upon my brother-man as a creature, as a thing void of any will of his own, instead of as a free personality, that furnishes ample proof that I have not yet recognized the true human dignity in myself. To own slaves is spiritual suicide and homicide. This sin is in no way excusable on account of the kind treatment accorded to the slaves by their owner, as he never can treat them humanely. When man becomes a piece of property he is robbed of his human dignity. </p>\n<p>In 1917, Kansas State Normal School <a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/Teaching/JMTSWAhrxSMC?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=%22human+dignity%22&pg=RA20-PA16&printsec=frontcover\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">published</a> a journal on teaching that called for instructors to help each pupil \"make completer use of his one lifetime\" because \"an abundant life, a life of awareness, a life of dignity is an undertaking worthy of gods.\" </p>\n<p>Thomas Bell's 1941 novel <a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/Out_Of_This_Furnace/TWLtI_V5YB4C?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=%22human+dignity%22&pg=PA411&printsec=frontcover\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Out of the Furnace</em></a> centered on an immigrant Slovak family in Pennsylvania. A character muses that it wasn't \"where you were born or how you spelled your name or where your father had come from\" that mattered; instead,</p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">It was the way you thought and felt about certain things. About freedom of speech and the equality of men and the importance of having one law—the same law—for rich and poor, for the people you liked and the people you didn't like. About the right of every man to live his life as he thought best, his right to defend it if anyone tried to change it and his right to change it himself if he decided he liked some other way of living better…. About human dignity, which helped a man live proudly and distinguished his death from animals; and finally, about the value to be put on a human life, one's enemy's no less than one's own. </p>\n<p>In a 1953 <a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/Progress_and_Human_Dignity/i4BMAQAAMAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=%22human+dignity%22&pg=PP8&printsec=frontcover\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">speech</a>, then Secretary of State John Foster Dulles argued that communist countries might be able to achieve short-term material gain, but \"results so produced are not a glory but a shame. They are achieved by desecrating the dignity of the human individual.\" Dulles believed human dignity meant being entitled to a life that included physical well-being and \"freedom to think, to believe, and to communicate with one's fellows,\" \"opportunities which permit some exercise of individual choices,\" and \"the contemplation and enjoyment of what is beautiful.\" </p>\n<h3></h3><br/><img class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"f90e6b1f91456d023b5cf3f376463ede\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"363c2\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDg0ODU4OC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYzNTkzNDQwMX0.oF6SRe8h4isr9BMUowNloz-wDivX95L8Gr739uCooIo/img.jpg?width=980\"/><h3></h3><br/><p>One hundred years after U.S. law stopped allowing Black Americans to be treated as property, Black writer James Baldwin was still <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/emilychamleewright/2020/06/30/living-up-to-the-liberal-promise/#784c5cc65139\" target=\"_blank\">calling</a> for Black Americans' dignity to be equally recognized. It was not enough, not nearly enough, that the 14th Amendment ensured equal protection of the laws; what mattered was how Black Americans were treated by their fellow human beings. In a 1960 Canadian television <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPaBXcEVpOE\" target=\"_blank\">interview</a>, Baldwin said, \"I don't know what white people see, you know, when they look at a Negro anymore. But I do know very well—I realized when I was very young—that whatever he was looking at, it wasn't me… I was not a <em>man</em>.\"</p><p>In his seminal 1963 book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Fire-Next-Time-James-Baldwin/dp/067974472X\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Fire Next Time</em></a>, Baldwin seemed to echo Dr. Hirsh's argument from a century earlier:</p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">I am very much concerned that American Negroes achieve their freedom here in the United States. But I am also concerned for their dignity, for the health of their souls, and must oppose any attempt that Negroes may make to do to others what has been done to them. I think I know—we see it around us every day—the spiritual wasteland to which that road leads. It is so simple a fact and one that is so hard, apparently, to grasp: <em>Whoever debases others debases himself.</em></p><p>This, then, is a common thread in our historic understanding of human dignity: Anyone who treats another human being as less than human undermines <em>their own</em> human dignity in addition to undermining the dignity of their victim.</p>A 1964 <em>New York University Law Review</em> <a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/Philosophical_Dimensions_of_Privacy/q_FrmXyl3hUC?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=%22human+dignity%22&pg=PA156&printsec=frontcover\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">article</a> argued that privacy was a key aspect of human dignity. \"A man whose home may be entered at the will of another, whose conversation may be overheard at the will of another, whose marital and familial intimacies may be overseen at the will of another, is less of a man, has less human dignity, on that account,\" wrote author Edward J. Bloustein, who later became president of Rutgers University.<h3>The future of dignity</h3><br/><p>Around the world, people are still working toward the full and equal recognition of human dignity. Every year, new speeches and writings help us understand what dignity is—not only what it looks like when dignity is violated but also what it looks like when dignity is honored. In his posthumous essay, Congressman Lewis wrote, \"When historians pick up their pens to write the story of the 21st century, let them say that it was your generation who laid down the heavy burdens of hate at last and that peace finally triumphed over violence, aggression and war.\"</p>\n<p>The more we talk about human dignity, the better we understand it. And the sooner we can make progress toward a shared vision of peace, freedom, and mutual respect for all. </p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/JfQjHASWQsk\" height=\"1\"
