Taking millennia to form, the rocks at the base of the canyon have been dated to be over 2 billion years old.</p>\n<p>While the canyon is popular, of the 6 million annual visitors, 99% go to the Grand Canyon for less than four hours. Of that time, the average visitor only spends 20 minutes at the actual canyon. Surprisingly, less than 1% of visitors actually walk down to the bottom.</p>\n<p>Hiking the Grand Canyon is really hard. It&#8217;s a sweaty, steep hike that is incredibly exhausting. But it&#8217;s worth it. There is more to the canyon than just the views overlooking the rim, yet so few people actually venture down to see what else is there.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2021/grandcanyon2.jpg\" width=\"675\" height=\"395\" alt=\"Nomadic Matt hiking in the Grand Canyon\"></p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been to the Grand Canyon twice. The first time, I hiked to the bottom. I’d seen the pictures and heard the stories, but nothing could have prepared me for just how huge it was. In front of me, stretching far and wide, were red and orange peaks and valleys, jutting and falling into the ground. </p>\n<p>Hiking down, you see all the desert animals, the intricacies of the ridges, the mountains, the streams, and the cliffs that aren’t noticeable from above. You see the color changes in the rocks up close, touching them, and enjoy the peacefulness of this place <a href=\"https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/overtourism-solutions/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">away from the crowds</a>. </p>\n<p>If you ever visit the Grand Canyon, hike down, even if just for a few hours. Hiking the Grand Canyon, you’ll get to experience the canyon in detail, and it gives you way more perspective than just looking out over the rim and going “ooohh” and “ahhh.”</p>\n<p>You’ll see the Colorado River up close as it cuts its way through the canyon, flowing fast and furiously as it sketches one of nature’s greatest paintings. </p>\n<p>From the bottom, the landscape takes on a totally new shape. The vast canyon disappears and all you can see is this little valley the river has cut.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2021/grandcanyon1.jpg\" width=\"675\" height=\"395\" alt=\"The stunning red rocks and cliffs of the Grand Canyon, USA\"></p>\n<p>After spending the night at the bottom, I awoke, my legs already sore. Yet I was still in for another 9.6-mile hike back up the canyon through hot, steep terrain. Hiking up was a lot tougher than hiking down, even when taking the flatter Bright Angel trail. After six hours of hiking, I made it out.</p>\n<p>Once over the top, all the pain, fatigue, and heat disappeared, giving way to sheer joy. I had mastered the canyon. I had done what few do. I felt like Rocky.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2021/grandcanyon3.jpg\" width=\"675\" height=\"395\" alt=\"The stunning red rocks and cliffs of the Grand Canyon, USA\"></p>\n<p>My second visit was a bit easier as I only did 6 miles to Skeleton Point. It was still a hard hike given the ascent involved but it&#8217;s a lot a good day hike, taking about 5.5 hours to complete.  </p>\n<p>Having done the Grand Canyon twice now, I can say that it&#8217;s something I think everyone needs to experience. </p>\n<p>Below are some tips for hiking the Grand Canyon:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Bring lots of water</strong> – This should go without saying, but if you&#8217;re planning to hike to the bottom you&#8217;re going to get thirsty. I&#8217;d suggest a water bottle as well as something like a CamelBak to keep you hydrated.</li>\n<li><strong>Walk slowly</strong> – If you&#8217;re hiking down to the bottom, take your time. Set a slow, easy pace. Make sure you give yourself lots of time so you don&#8217;t have to rush. Rushing will see you get exhausted sooner and go through your water quicker.</li>\n<li><strong>Skip the bus tour</strong> – Tours from nearby cities like Las Vegas are a common way to see the canyon. They can even be cheap. What they aren&#8217;t is enjoyable because you&#8217;re rushed and don&#8217;t get to enjoy the trip. Rent a car or find a rideshare. You&#8217;ll have a much better experience.</li>\n<li><strong>Visit during the shoulder season</strong> – Summers at the canyon are busy. Even if you get there early you&#8217;ll still find a crowd, so consider visiting in the shoulder season. That way you won&#8217;t get the sweltering heat or the bustling crowds.</li>\n<li><strong>Pick the right hike</strong> – If you don&#8217;t have a lot of time but want to hike, choose the Kaibab Trail to Cedar Ridge (3 miles).</li>\n<li><strong>Get there early</strong> – The park gets busy around sunset, with many visitors wanting to get the perfect shot. Get there early so you can get the best view without having a mob of people in your way.</li>\n<li><strong>If you want to camp, book now!</strong> &#8211; The campgrounds are filling up fast. Phantom Ranch (the main lodge at the bottom) is under renovation and, due to COVID, very limited in the number of people they can have.</li>\n<li><strong>Get a National Park Pass</strong> &#8211; The Grand Canyon is $35 USD per vehicle so get the annual National Parks pass. It&#8217;s $80 USD and good for a year. You can come in and out of the park as much as you want and visit any other parks for free. It pays for itself very quickly!</li>\n<li><strong>Take Rt 64 to enter/exit the park</strong> &#8211; This takes you to the eastern part of the canyon where there are tons of lookouts and over a super scenic road. It&#8217;s way better than driving from Flagstaff via 180. 64 takes longer but the drive is way more scenic. There&#8217;s Sunset Crater and Wupatki National Monument on the way too (your annual pass gets you in both for free too).</li>\n<li><strong>Be prepared</strong> &#8211; It&#8217;s a lot harder to hike than you think. Don&#8217;t try to hike down and back up again in a day unless you’re a super pro at this.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Suggested Hiking Trails</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2021/grandcanyon5.jpg\" width=\"675\" height=\"395\" alt=\"The stunning red rocks and cliffs of the Grand Canyon, USA\"><br />\nIf you&#8217;re looking to stretch your legs, here are a few hikes you can do:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>South Kaibab Trail to Cedar Ridge (3 miles roundtrip)</li>\n<li>South Kaibab Trail to Skeleton Point (6 miles roundtrip)</li>\n<li>Grandview Trail to the first overlook (2.5 miles roundtrip, but more difficult)</li>\n<li>Bright Angel Trail to Plateau Point (12.2 miles roundtrip)</li>\n<li>Bright Angel to Indian Gardens (4.5 miles roundtrip)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For more trail suggestions, check out <a href=\"https://www.alltrails.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">AllTrails.com</a>.

It has an airport, train service, and is a 90-minute drive from nearby Flagstaff. If you&#8217;re coming on a day trip from <a href=\"https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/united-states-travel-guide/las-vegas/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Las Vegas</a> it&#8217;s around a 4.5-hour drive to the South Rim.</p>\n<p>The North Rim is located on the Utah side of the Grand Canyon and the entrance station is 30 miles south of Jacob Lake on Highway 67. The North Rim village may only be reached by road. There won&#8217;t be nearly as many tourists here, but it arguably doesn&#8217;t have as great of a view.</p>\n<p>Admission to the Grand Canyon is $35 for a vehicle permit or $20 for an individual (say if you&#8217;re coming by bus or bicycle.) Permits last seven days and can be bought online or in person. Cash and credit card are accepted.</p>\n<p>You can also go <a href=\"https://www.ottsworld.com/blogs/rafting-in-the-grand-canyon-what-to-expect/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">rafting in the Grand Canyon</a> or take a scenic helicopter tour over it. Tours last around an hour and cost at least $299 per person.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re looking to sleep in the canyon at the bottom, you&#8217;ll need to apply for lodging at Phantom Ranch, the only lodging in the actual canyon. The Ranch operates on a lottery system due to its high demand. You&#8217;ll need to make your booking 13-15 months in advance (you only pay if you are chosen). Names are drawn every month for the following year. For example, they draw lottery winners in June 2021 for visits in June 2022. So, you&#8217;ll need to apply early to get a chance at a spot. <a href=\"https://www.grandcanyonlodges.com/lodging/lottery/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Here is the lottery schedule</a>.</p>\n<p>While there are usually both dorms and cabins available, currently the dorms are closed due to COVID-19. Capacity at the Ranch is also reduced to 50% until further notice.</p>\n<p>A two-person cabin is $172 USD per night. A bed in the dorm (when it&#8217;s open) is $62 USD. Meals are extra and cost around $25-50 USD.</p>\n<p>If you want to camp below the rim, you&#8217;ll need to apply for a backcountry permit. Permits are $10 USD plus $8 USD per person. </p>\n<p>There are also campgrounds above the rim (which don&#8217;t require a permit). There are two on the South Rim and one on the North Rim. Only one campground is open all year, however; the rest close in the winter. Basic plots without electricity start at $18 USD per night. It&#8217;s best to make your reservation in advance (especially on the South Rim). </p>\n<p>For more camping information (including how to make a reservation), <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/camping.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">visit the NPS website</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"single-booking\">\n<h4>Book Your Trip: Logistical Tips and Tricks</h4>\n<p><strong>Book Your Flight</strong><br />\nUse <a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-3032045-12837948\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Skyscanner</a> or <a href=\"https://www.momondo.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Momondo</a> to find a cheap flight.

Each year, the iconic mountain attracts thousands who spend days attempting to reach her snowy summit. </p>\n<p>Since I’ve never hiked the mountain, I’ve invited my community manager, Chris, to share his tips and advice to help you save money and boost your chances of reaching “the Roof of Africa.”</em></p>\n<p>Standing on top of Kilimanjaro at sunrise was one of the most amazing feelings I’ve ever had. After a week of struggle — including hiking over 17 hours in a single day — I had made it to the frigid summit. For a few moments, I was the highest person on the entire continent. That was a truly magical feeling.</p>\n<p>Kilimanjaro holds a special place in the travel world. It’s one of those activities — like Everest base camp, <a href=\"https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/hiking-the-inca-trail/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Machu Picchu</a>, or the Camino — that attracts a certain kind of traveler. The kind who wants a challenge, who wants to push themselves, to test themselves. </p>\n<p>While hiking Kilimanjaro has become more tourist-friendly over the years, it’s still a serious challenge. People still get hurt — and die — on the mountain every single year. Only 45–65% of people who start the hike make it to the top.</p>\n<p>However, with a little planning and preparation, you can greatly increase your chances of reaching “the Roof of Africa.” Here’s everything you need to know to make the most of your trip:<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>The Routes</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2021/kilimanjaro2.jpg\" width=\"675\" height=\"395\" alt=\"People hiking along one of the many routes up Mount Kilimanjaro\"><br />\nThere are six routes on Kilimanjaro, each one a different length, with varying degrees of difficulty and differing success rates. The route you choose will depend on your budget, how long you have for the trip, and the company you book your expedition with.</p>\n<p>Here’s an overview of the main routes:</p>\n<p><strong>Marangu</strong>: This is “the Coca-Cola route,” named after the fact that there are huts along the way where you can sleep and buy things — like a cold Coke. It actually has a low success rate, however, as people underestimate the challenge and opt to rush to the top in five days instead of taking more time to acclimatize.</p>\n<p><strong>Machame</strong>: This is the most popular route. When done in seven days, it has a success rate of over 60%, hence its popularity. It’s called “the whiskey” route,” hinting at the fact that it’s a more serious challenge than the Coca-Cola route.</p>\n<p><strong>Rongai</strong>: This is the easiest route on Kilimanjaro. It’s a bit less scenic and more expensive (there aren’t as many budget operators here), but it’s the only route that approaches from the north. It’s also much less busy.</p>\n<p><strong>Shira</strong>: This route jumps into some high-altitude gains early on before joining the Machame route. It’s challenging and more expensive, since you start in the west before linking up with the main route. </p>\n<p><strong>Lemosho</strong>: This is the most beautiful route up the mountain, which is why I chose it. It offers lots of variety and plenty of challenge. It’s one of the more expensive routes, however.</p>\n<p><strong>Umbwe</strong>: This route is really only for experienced climbers looking for an extreme challenge. It’s a lot of scrambling and climbing as opposed to regular hiking.</p>\n<p>Regardless of what route you take, I would suggest nothing less than seven days. Don’t rush this trip. Although it will cost more money, the slower you go, the better your body adapts to the altitude, which is the #1 thing you can do to drastically increase your chances of success.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Costs</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2021/kilimanjaro3.jpg\" width=\"675\" height=\"395\" alt=\"The snowy path near the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro\"><br />\nAs with all travel, there is a wide range of price points available. There are luxury companies that will haul a full-size bed up the mountain so you don’t have to sleep on the ground, and there are super cheap companies that cut corners and likely don’t pay their porters fairly in order to keep costs low.</p>\n<p>I suggest going for a more middle-of-the-road company for two reasons:</p>\n<p>First, they will have more qualified guides, so you can learn more during your hike. These companies also usually pay their porters fairly, so you can be confident your team is taken care of.</p>\n<p>Second, you’ll know that the company isn’t cutting corners. There is a lot of competition for Kilimanjaro treks, so you know if one company is just too cheap to be true that they are likely skimping on something. Since this is a once-in-a-lifetime adventure, don’t be cheap.</p>\n<p>Prices range from $1,000 to over $5,000 USD per person. I wouldn’t book with any company charging less than $2,000 USD (I paid around $2,200 for my trip, before tipping — see more on that below), as anything under that is going to be bare-bones. </p>\n<p>Remember, people get seriously injured on this mountain every year, and around 10 are killed. Don’t cut corners! Pay for a reputable company with good reviews. Not only will you enjoy your trip more but you’ll feel more comfortable and be safer.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Finding a Tour Company</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2021/kilimanjaro4.jpg\" width=\"675\" height=\"395\" alt=\"A tent on the ground near the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro in Africa\"><br />\nSince climbing without porters is prohibited, you’re going to need to hire a company to supply you with everything you need: gear, guides, porters, paperwork, and everything in between.</p>\n<p>But there are tons of companies available. How do you decide which to go with? </p>\n<p>Here are a few tips:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Read reviews</strong> &#8211; Once you’ve narrowed down your choices based on your budget, look for a company that has positive reviews. While online reviews should always be taken with a grain of salt, they will help you establish a first impression. Keep an eye out for details about the gear and food provided.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Ask about their client/porter ratio</strong> &#8211; How many other travelers will you be going with? And how many porters/guides/assistant guides will be included? You don’t want to be stuck in a huge group where you don’t get personalized attention if you have questions or concerns.</p>\n<p><strong>3. What is their success rate?</strong> &#8211; What is the company’s success rate for the route you’re looking at? While they can’t control the weather, they can do everything in their power to get their clients to the top.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Are they a responsible company?</strong> &#8211; The Kilimanjaro Porters Assistance Project has a list of tour operators that meet their standards for responsible and ethical travel. <a href=\"https://mountainexplorers.org/climb-with-a-partner-for-responsible-travel-company/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Book with a company on this list</a> to ensure that your porters are fairly treated. I didn’t know about this list before I went, and it’s one of my biggest regrets about the trip.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Pick a company with included accommodation</strong> &#8211; Most companies include a free hotel stay for the night before your trek and for the night after (as well as pick-up and drop-off). Make sure you choose a company that offers this, so you can get a decent night’s sleep before your hike and enjoy a real bed after your strenuous time on the mountain.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-3032045-12356898-1443635018000\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Intrepid Travel</a> and <a href=\"https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-3032045-12390165\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">G Adventures</a> are two companies I would recommend. They meet KPAP’s guidelines and offer a variety of treks with qualified local guides. Start your search with them.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>A Note on Tipping Your Guides</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2021/kilimanjaro5.jpg\" width=\"675\" height=\"395\" alt=\"A Kilimanjaro porter carrying a large sack on his head\"><br />\nIn addition to paying the company you book with, you will also need to tip your team of porters. My sister and I had a team of 12 with us — just for the two of us! Porters to carry our gear, a cook, someone to carry (and clean) the toilet, a waiter/assistant cook, our main guide, and then our assistant guide. It takes a lot to get to the summit; you aren’t doing this alone after all! </p>\n<p>At the end of your trip, usually while you’re still on the mountain, you’ll need to tip your team. This has to be done in the local currency — which means you’ll need to get all that cash before you hike and carry it with you on the trek. </p>\n<p>You’ll be tipping a specific amount per day to each porter, a bit more to the cook, and then a bit more to the guides. Breakdowns usually look something like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Main guide &#8211; $20 USD per day</li>\n<li>Assistant guide &#8211; $15 USD per day</li>\n<li>Cook &#8211; $12 USD per day</li>\n<li>Toilet engineer &#8211; $5-10 USD per day</li>\n<li>Waiter &#8211; $5-10 USD per day</li>\n<li>Porters &#8211; $5-10 USD per day (each)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What I read online beforehand stated that a 15% tip is customary. So, if you paid $2,500 USD for your trip than you’d tip at least $330 USD to the team. When I asked my guide about this, he said a normal tip was closer to $1,000 USD&#8230;which is almost a 50% tip.</p>\n<p>As you can imagine, things can get awkward if someone is expecting $1,000 USD and you give them an envelope with just $400 USD — and most teams will open the envelope while you’re standing right there in front of them. It can get a little uncomfortable.</p>\n<p>Obviously, your porters deserve to be paid fairly. They are doing incredibly challenging work. If you can afford a generous tip, they 100% deserve it. For minimum tipping guidelines, I encourage you to follow the <a href=\"https://kiliporters.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kilimanjaro Porters Assistance Project’s guidelines</a>.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>13 Tips for Hiking Kilimanjaro</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2021/kilimanjaro6.jpg\" width=\"675\" height=\"395\" alt=\"Sunset over Mount Kilimanjaro in Africa\"><br />\n<strong>1. Make sure your insurance will cover you</strong><br />\nMost travel insurance policies have restrictions on how high you can hike. That means that if you get injured over a certain altitude, your policy won’t apply. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.worldnomads.com/lovedby/nomadic-matt?affiliate=nmts&#038;subId=brandlink&#038;utm_source=nmts&#038;utm_medium=affiliate&#038;utm_campaign=Affiliate&#038;utm_content=brandlink\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">World Nomads</a>, for example, covers up to 19,685 feet on its Standard Plan and their Explorer Plan (I booked my coverage through them for that reason). (Kilimanjaro is 5,895 m (19,340 ft) high.)</p>\n<p>No matter who you book with, make sure you will be covered at all altitudes.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Train in advance</strong><br />\nEvery route on Kilimanjaro will offer its own challenges. In order to meet — and overcome — those challenges, you need to make sure you’re physically fit. While most days on the trail are relatively easy, you do a lot of elevation gains, and the last day can involve upwards of 17 hours of hiking in a 24-hour period. I’m not saying you need to be jacked, but you do want to make sure you can handle a week of walking uphill. </p>\n<p><strong>3. Prepare for a mental battle</strong><br />\nKilimanjaro is just as much of a mental battle as it is physical one. While the final day is incredibly physically challenging, it’s also a mental marathon. Hiking for up to 17 hours, in freezing temperatures, in the pitch black, while also battling the altitude and the weather? That’s a recipe for disaster unless you can keep your mental fortitude. </p>\n<p><strong>4. Bring altitude medication</strong><br />\nThe altitude really does impact everyone differently. I saw people less than an hour from the summit who turned back because of it. I highly recommend you bring and take altitude medication just in case. I found it super helpful. Your doctor can give you an overview of your options and their side effects, but I took Diamox and didn’t really suffer any altitude sickness at all. However, the side effect was that I had to pee constantly (which can be inconvenient for women). </p>\n<p><strong>5. Bring a water filter</strong><br />\nYour porter team will make sure you have water during your hike. It’s collected from different areas on the mountain, boiled, and then served to you. Since the water is boiled, it’s perfectly safe. However, it never hurts to be extra safe. Bring a filter like <a href=\"https://lifestraw.xyibsh.net/qM7kL\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">LifeStraw</a> or <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3sHtfda\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">SteriPen</a> to ensure that your water is free from bacteria. Better safe than sorry!</p>\n<p><strong>6. Book a company that includes gear</strong><br />\nIf you’re an avid hiker, chances are you have all the gear you need. However, bringing it with you to Tanzania is likely more hassle than it’s worth — especially when you consider that you need cold-weather gear for summit night, which takes up a lot of space. For that reason, make sure you book a company that has all the gear you need: hiking poles, winter hiking gear for the summit, sleeping bags, gaiters — the list goes on. Most companies include gear, but it’s always a good idea to double-check.</p>\n<p><strong>7. Bring snacks!</strong><br />\nThis one is super important for your mental well-being. While the cooks on the mountain are incredibly gifted, I encourage you to bring snacks, so you have a pick-me-up to look forward to. I brought several bags of cookies and candies, so I had a sugar boost during the day for, as well as something for camp. Just make sure you save a bunch for summit night because that’s when you’ll need it most.</p>\n<p><strong>8. Pay extra for a toilet</strong><br />\nMost companies will charge extra for a portable toilet that will accompany you (it’s just a small travel toilet in a narrow tent so you have some privacy). It’s incredibly basic but absolutely worth every penny. The few toilets in the various camps are disgusting, so having your own private toilet tent is a worthwhile expense.</p>\n<p><strong>9.  Stay hydrated</strong><br />\nI drank 4-5 liters of water per day while hiking. I was literally drinking all day every day. You’ll need at least 3L on you during the day, and the rest you can drink in camp. That means you’ll need a <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2OwJ4V6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">2-3L water bladder</a> and then maybe an extra 1L bottle. Always make sure they are full before you set off for the day — and make sure they are empty by the time you get to camp. Staying hydrated is one of the most important things you can do to increase your chances of making it to the top.</p>\n<p><strong>10. Break in your footwear</strong><br />\nIf you’re buying new hiking boots for this trip, make sure you break them in. You’ll want at least one month of regular wear in the boots to make sure you don’t get blisters. Over the years, I’ve seen some nasty wounds among travelers who didn’t break in their boots for one hike or another. Don’t make the same mistake!</p>\n<p><strong>11. Go slow — and then go even slower</strong><br />\nI’m a fast walker and a fast hiker, so this was tricky for me, but it’s super important that you take it slowly so you can acclimatize. Your guides will constantly remind you of this —listen to them! On summit night, my speed was half a foot per stride (compared to my usual stride of around three feet). The slower you go, the more likely it is that you will succeed.</p>\n<p><strong>12. Double-check your dietary concerns</strong><br />\nIf you have an allergy or special diet, make sure the company knows. And then remind them — multiple times. I informed our company three times that my sister is vegetarian and <a href=\"https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/eating-vegan-travel-interview/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">I am vegan</a> — and we still got meat on day one. Fortunately, we got it all sorted out and had an amazing cook for our trip, but that could have gone sideways very easily. Kili is the last place you want to be lacking calories (or running to the toilet!).</p>\n<p><strong>13. Bring extra batteries for your camera</strong><br />\nAfter 7+ days of hiking, chances are your phone and camera will be dead. Bring an external charger and/or extra batteries for your camera so that you can be sure to have juice for summit day. You don’t want to get to the top and not be able to snap some photos!<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Hiking Kilimanjaro: Frequently Asked Questions</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2021/kilimanjaro7.jpg\" width=\"675\" height=\"395\" alt=\"The view from the peak of Mount Kilimanjaro\"><br />\n<strong>How long is the hike?</strong><br />\nHikes range from 5 to 9 days usually, depending on the route. The longer you take, the easier your hike will be, since you’ll be able to go slow and adapt to the altitude.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you get altitude sickness on Kilimanjaro?</strong><br />\nThe altitude can cause headaches and fatigue, so take it slow and bring altitude medication just to be safe. I took altitude medication and never had any issues. However, I saw numerous people turn back — even someone who was just an hour from the top — because of the altitude. So take it slow, listen to your guide, and bring medication just in case.</p>\n<p><strong>How hard is the hike?</strong><br />\nIt’s challenging. Most days aren’t particularly hard, but there are some days that were exhausting. You’ll want to be physically fit.</p>\n<p>Personally, I only found summit day challenging. It involved hiking all day, sleeping for a few hours, and then starting for the summit around midnight. You hike in the dark, and it’s incredibly cold (I had five layers on). After 20 minutes on the peak, you head back down, which means you hike upwards of 15-17 hours in a 24-hour period. It’s exhausting but worth it!</p>\n<p><strong>Do you need oxygen to hike Kilimanjaro?</strong><br />\nNope!</p>\n<p><strong>What is the best month to climb?</strong><br />\nThe best times to climb Kilimanjaro are from December to March and from June and October. That’s when it is the driest.</p>\n<p><strong>How cold is it at the top?</strong><br />\nAt night, it can get as low as -20°C (-4°F) at the summit. It was frigid when I arrived at the top at sunrise (my water bottle and water bladder were frozen).</p>\n<p><strong>Why don’t people succeed in making it to the summit?</strong><br />\nThe main reasons people don’t make it are the weather, altitude sickness, and lack of physical fitness. Make sure you train in advance and bring altitude meds to boost your odds of reaching the summit!</p>\n<p><center>***</center></p>\n<p>Hiking Kilimanjaro is an amazing, challenging, and rewarding adventure. While it isn’t cheap and does takes some planning (and training), reaching the summit makes it all worthwhile. </p>\n<p>By taking the above tips and advice to heart, you&#8217;ll not only save money and get more out of your trip, you&#8217;ll drastically increase your odds of succeeding on your trek, giving you the opportunity to stand on the roof of Africa and bask in the continents natural beauty.</p>\n<p><div class=\"single-booking\">\n<h4>Book Your Trip: Logistical Tips and Tricks</h4>\n<p><strong>Book Your Flight</strong><br />\nFind a cheap flight by using <a href=\"http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-3032045-12837948\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Skyscanner</a> or <a href=\"https://www.momondo.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Momondo</a>.

I check them regularly when I&#8217;m on the hunt for a new trip. They are just unmatched in the deals they find (at least for the US market). Its founder, Scott Keyes, recently wrote a book sharing all his insider tips and tricks called <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3eOdCMr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Take More Vacations: How to Search Better, Book Cheaper, and Travel the World</a></em>. (Disclosure: I blurbed it. It&#8217;s really good.)</p>\n<p>Over the years, Scott and I have become friends because of our mutual love of saving money when we travel. I sat down with him to talk about his book, the secrets to finding cheap flights, and what to expect in a post-COVID world. (While some of his tips are US centric, for those outside the states, there&#8217;s still some information here you&#8217;ll find useful.)</p>\n<p><strong>Nomadic Matt: Tell everyone about yourself. How did you get into this?</strong><br />\n<strong>Scott:</strong> After I graduated college and began working as an underpaid journalist, I realized that my hopes of traveling overseas were entirely dependent on my ability to find cheap flights. I threw myself into the subject, researching and testing and figuring out why airfare behaves the way it does and all the things one can do to get the best possible price on flights.</p>\n<p>It all culminated in 2013 when I stumbled upon the best deal I’ve ever personally gotten in my life: nonstop from NYC to Milan for $130 roundtrip. Though I’d had no plans to visit Milan, when I saw that fare it was, of course, a total no-brainer. There’s nowhere in the world I wouldn’t go for $130 roundtrip!</p>\n<p>When I got back from that flight, word had spread to my friends and coworkers, and one-by-one they kept coming up to me with the same request: “Hey Scott, next time you find a deal like that, can you let me know so I can get it, too?” By the time the 8th person had asked me, I realized I wasn’t going to be able to remember everyone I needed to let know, so I turned to the simplest solution: start a simple little email list. I had no idea at the time, but in that moment, <a href=\"https://scottscheapflights.yuy8ab.net/c/214481/723070/10802\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Scott’s Cheap Flights</a> was born.</p>\n<p><strong>Why did you write this book?</strong><br />\nThere’s this weird conundrum in our lives: we all want to travel more than we actually do.</p>\n<p>I figured there could be two possible causes: time and money. Not enough time is certainly the case for many, but I don’t think that’s the case for most people. Turns out more than half of Americans don’t use all their vacation time, and collectively we leave around a billion vacation days unused every year.</p>\n<p>Instead, it’s the expense and hassle of booking flights that stymie so many of our travel dreams. And that’s because airfare is the most uniquely torturous thing we buy. The fact that this thing we need in order to travel is so volatile and incomprehensible leads us to overpay for flights or, worse, pass up would-be trips.</p>\n<p>Think of it this way: if you had a promo code that made all your future flights just $200 roundtrip, would you travel more than you do today? For most of us, that answer is yes.</p>\n<p>In other words, unless you happen to have a trust fund, <a href=\"https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-tips/how-to-find-a-cheap-flight/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cheap flights</a> are the key that opens up the world.</p>\n<p><strong>Who do you think <em>Take More Vacations</em> will be helpful for?</strong><br />\nAnyone who dreams of traveling more than they actually do, and anyone who gets anxious every time they buy tickets because they have no idea how to avoid overpaying.</p>\n<p>One of the biggest misconceptions in my world is that cheap flights have to be inconvenient flights. Not true! The flight that led to me starting Scott’s Cheap Flights, for example, was a nonstop United flight I found from New York City to Milan for $130 roundtrip, including two checked bags.</p>\n<p>Similarly, another major fallacy is that cheap flights are only for people with complete flexibility. I devoted an entire chapter of <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3eOdCMr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Take More Vacations</a></em> to the subject of flexibility because so often I see travelers unwittingly sacrifice their ability to get cheap flights by telling themselves “I don’t have flexibility.”</p>\n<p>Of course, someone with complete flexibility has better your chances of scoring a good deal than someone whose dates and destinations are locked in stone. But one of the costliest mistakes people regularly make is thinking about flexibility as an on/off switch rather than a dimmer switch. “I don’t have flexibility” is a self-imposed trap that will ensure your travel dreams never become more than that. The more flexibility you can find for yourself, the better your odds of getting a cheap flight.</p>\n<p>This book isn’t just for 22-year-olds taking a post-graduation trip to <a href=\"https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/europe-travel-tips/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Europe</a>. It’s for anyone hoping to travel more and better.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2021/scott1.jpg\" width=\"675\" height=\"395\" alt=\"Scott Keyes from Scott's Cheap Flights posing for a photo in Italy\"></p>\n<p><strong>If it’s true that we’ve been living in the Golden Age of Cheap Flights, why do people so many people still overpay for airfare?</strong><br />\nFirst and foremost, it’s because airfare behaves like nothing else we buy. When you buy bagels, the price is essentially the same on any given day, and it mostly depends on how many you buy. But when you buy flights, the price is extraordinarily volatile. The same flight that costs $800 today may cost $300 tomorrow and $1,300 the next day. And the price of a flight bears little relation to how far you travel. It generally costs more to fly from <a href=\"https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/united-states-travel-guide/new-york-city/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">New York</a> to Des Moines than from New York to <a href=\"https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/spain-travel-tips/barcelona/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Barcelona</a>, for instance.</p>\n<p>Given the complexity and volatility of airfare, cognitive biases cause us to overpay for flights. For instance, most of us employ loss aversion when we’re booking flights; we fear a $300 increase more than we relish a $300 drop, so we pull the trigger on an expensive flight because we’re worried it’ll get even more expensive. </p>\n<p>Recency bias is another one; if the fare stays put for a while, we may pull the trigger because we figure that’s just what the trip costs, without realizing that fare is likely to soon change. There’s also sunk cost fallacy—we get invested in the idea of a specific trip, and despite expensive flights, refuse to consider elsewhere. </p>\n<p>And finally, good old procrastination! We put off buying tickets too long and wind up booking flights last minute when they are, invariably, expensive.</p>\n<p><strong>Why do you think so many false myths about cheap airfare (buy on Tuesday, clear your cookies, etc) persist when they are so clearly wrong? </strong></p>\n<p>I think it’s because airfare is so confusing. Prices are constantly jumping around, seemingly at random, and sometimes fares seem to make no sense at all, like recently when flights from Pittsburgh to Tokyo were available for $316 roundtrip while a flight from Pittsburgh to Philadelphia cost $312 roundtrip.</p>\n<p>That confusion leads people to see patterns that aren’t actually correct or helpful but seem to be a reasonable enough explanation. In the same way, a penny that comes up heads three times in a row isn’t actually “due” for tails on the fourth flip, people make inferences about airfare because it offers some solace for a difficult-to-understand purchase.</p>\n<p>And, so even though, as I explain in Chapter 9, it’s not the case that clearing your cookies makes flights cheaper, and it’s not the case that flights are cheapest to book on Tuesday at 1pm, these myths persist because they explain what seems inexplicable. Fortunately, you and I are out here doing our best to mythbust!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2021/scott3.jpg\" width=\"675\" height=\"395\" alt=\"Scott Keyes from Scott's Cheap Flights in a field of flowers\"></p>\n<p><strong>In Chapter 3, you discuss how the way we’ve been searching for flights is backward. Tell us more about that.</strong></p>\n<p>Almost every overseas vacation I’ve taken in the past decade has been a trip I didn’t plan to take.</p>\n<p>Roundtrip to Milan for $130. Osaka for $169. Barcelona $222. Brussels $225, twice.</p>\n<p>I hadn’t planned to visit <a href=\"https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/italy-travel-tips/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Italy</a> or <a href=\"https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/japan-travel-tips/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Japan</a> or <a href=\"https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/spain-travel-tips/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Spain</a> before buying flights to those very countries. It’s not that I wasn’t interested in seeing those places—come on, it’s Europe and Japan—but, like most people, I have thousands of places I’d love to visit if airfare was no concern.</p>\n<p>What prompted my interest in those specific trips, in other words, was the fact that fares had dropped so precipitously.</p>\n<p>The way most of us book our flights is a three-step process that probably sounds familiar:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Step 1</strong>: Pick your destination</li>\n<li><strong>Step 2</strong>: Pick your dates</li>\n<li><strong>Step 3</strong>: Check for flights</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We say we want cheap flights, but by setting airfare as the least important priority, is it any surprise that so many of us end up overpaying for flights? Knowingly or not, the most expensive mistake we make when booking flights is choosing a trip rather than choosing a fare.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, there’s a better way, and it’s elegantly simple: Take that same three-step process and flip it on its head.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Step 1</strong>: See where there are cheap flights departing your home airport</li>\n<li><strong>Step 2</strong>: Pick one of those cheap destinations</li>\n<li><strong>Step 3</strong>: Pick one of the cheap dates</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You’re allowed to have preferences, of course. I’m just encouraging you to put airfare in context. Few of us would go to a restaurant, reject the waiter’s offer to look at the menu, and order the ribeye with zero consideration for price or other options. </p>\n<p>But that’s exactly what many of us do with flights. </p>\n<p>We set our heart on one specific vacation, price be damned. If <a href=\"https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/czech-republic-travel-tips/prague/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Prague</a> is at the top of your list, would you still pay $1,000 for flights if you knew there were $250 flights to <a href=\"https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/france-travel-tips/paris/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Paris</a>?</p>\n<p><strong>What are three things you want people to take away from this book? </strong><br />\nFirst, the way we traditionally search for flights is harming your ability to get a good deal. We all say we want cheap flights, but our normal way of searching for flights inadvertently undercuts our ability to get cheap flights. </p>\n<p>Instead, in many cases, the secret to getting cheap fares—and thus getting three vacations for what you used to pay for one—simply boils down to making them the top priority. That doesn’t mean only traveling to nearby cities or taking inconvenient flights; on the contrary, with a better approach, you can fly almost anywhere with cheap (and good) flights.</p>\n<p>Second, recognizing that airfare is exceptionally volatile. Destinations don’t have a single, stable price. Flights to Japan aren’t normally $202 roundtrip, except occasionally when they are (like they were just a few weeks ago). Today’s expensive flight may be tomorrow’s cheap one, and vice versa.</p>\n<p>Finally, <a href=\"https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-tips/how-to-find-a-cheap-flight/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cheap flights</a> don’t just save money; they lead to better trips by letting you experience more at your destination. They lead to more trips and boost your interim happiness because you know the next one isn’t far off. And they expand the types of places you visit and let you discover places that appeal to you personally, rather than the average tourist.</p>\n<p><strong>You’ve searched millions of flights. What are some of the crazy insights you’ve learned about airlines in that time? </strong><br />\nMy favorite part about airfare is the funny anomalies. For instance, we all think of Thanksgiving as an exceedingly expensive time to travel. And it is—for domestic flights. But Thanksgiving is actually a hidden gem for cheap international flights. That’s because all those people flying home to visit family and eat turkey are, by definition, not flying overseas. With less competition for international destinations, the fares are often quite cheap.</p>\n<p>Similarly, I love the anomaly of how when you’re traveling somewhere remote, it can be cheaper to split your trip into multiple itineraries rather than one. I call this the Greek Island Trick. </p>\n<p>Say, for instance, you want to fly from NYC to <a href=\"https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/greece-travel-tips/santorini/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Santorini</a>. If you search that route on Google Flights, fares often come back upwards of $1,600. But if you search for flights from NYC to Athens, those regularly go on sale for as little as $350 roundtrip. And once you’re in Athens, you can hop a ferry or budget flight on to Santorini for as little as $50. So by splitting your itinerary, you can wind up saving 75% off normal prices, and even take a few days to visit Athens before heading over to Santorini!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2021/scott4.jpg\" width=\"675\" height=\"395\" alt=\"Scott Keyes from Scott's Cheap Flights swimming\"></p>\n<p><strong>Where do you see airfare going in a post-COVID world? I see short-term deals but long-term increases. What are your thoughts? </strong><br />\nThere’s a lot of concern that as travel demand rebounds, that’ll be the end of cheap flights. But here’s why, on the contrary, I think the future of cheap flights looks really bright.</p>\n<p>First, while the pandemic certainly woke many people up to how far airfare had fallen, what many people missed was that since 2015, we have been living in the Golden Age of Cheap Flights. The pandemic didn’t cause cheap fares. The pandemic *illuminated* cheap fares. So if a resurgence of travel interest leads to pre-covid airfares, we should be so lucky!</p>\n<p>The reason I’m so bullish on the continued long-term availability of cheap flights is that airline business models have been revamped over the past few decades. Go back 40 years ago and airlines made most of their money on economy fares. Today, airlines make most of their money from other revenue streams: selling credit cards and miles, premium tickets like business class, corporate contracts, cargo, and so on. In other words, airlines can afford to sell you $250 flights to Europe or Japan because those fares are far less consequential to their bottom line than they used to be.</p>\n<p>I think it’s likely we’ll see headlines over the next few months about average fares going up. Indeed, Airlines for America’s <a href=\"https://www.airlines.org/dataset/impact-of-covid19-data-updates/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">analysis</a> already shows that average fares have been steadily increasing since February. </p>\n<p>And yet, during that time period, we’ve found roundtrip fares like $124 to Hawaii, $378 to Greece, and $202 to Japan. The key point to remember next time you see a headline about flight prices increasing is this: You can’t book average fares. You can only book available fares.</p>\n<p><strong>Last question: You’re a man who takes a lot of flights. Do you have a favorite experience?</strong><br />\nThis is going to be sappy so I apologize in advance, but my favorite flight experience is flying with my young daughter. I’ve taken thousands of flights in my life, and while I still love being in the air, the magic has faded just a bit. But not for her! Everything about flying, from the seats to windows to the noise to the turbulence to the liftoff to the majestic views from 30,000 feet, getting to be reminded by her how special it is, and getting to experience it through her eyes, is incredibly fun.</p>\n<p><center>****</center></p>\n<p><em>Scott Keyes, is the founder and Chief Flight Expert of Scott&#8217;s Cheap Flights, a website that finds and shares the best flight deals on the web.
