Mine is centered on an unbending desire to see Trump's political career end in humiliating defeat.&#160;</p><p>An ideal scenario would be voters rendering Trumpism toxic overnight by not only firing him from the presidency, but giving Democrats full control of Congress. Only when Trump proves himself a liability to the party he hijacked can the GOP be reborn as something resembling their supposed ideals, a free market-supporting center-right party that <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-trade-war-china-beijing-tariffs-unmitigated-disaster-2020-9\">wouldn't pursue policies like an economically damaging trade war</a>.&#160;</p><p>Not because my political identity is particularly fascinating, but merely for the context of this column, I've taken to calling myself a \"civil libertarian,\" mainly because civil liberties issues are what animate me most.</p><p>At various times I've voted for Libertarian, Republican, and Democratic presidential tickets. I'm atypical in the American electorate — a politically-active registered independent who rejects the duopoly and truly holds no allegiance to either liberal or conservative orthodoxy.&#160;</p><p>Point being, I'm nobody's reliable Democratic voter.&#160;</p><p>And I am not voting for Biden/Harris because I have any hope of them \"<a href=\"https://unitethecountry.com/\">uniting</a>\" the country or \"<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-11/joe-biden-s-return-to-normalcy-campaign-has-echoes-of-1920\">returning us to normalcy</a>.\" With some of the most prominent voices on the left twisting themselves into pretzels to <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/stop-making-excuses-protesters-act-like-bad-cops-portland-seattle-2020-9\">justify rioting and looting</a>, and the US' major right-leaning party openly <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-laura-loomer-marjorie-greene-qanon-gop-party-conspiracy-theory-2020-8https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-laura-loomer-marjorie-greene-qanon-gop-party-conspiracy-theory-2020-8\">embracing QAnon conspiracy theorists and bigots</a>, I'm confident this country is politically and culturally broken, and will be for some time.&#160;</p><p>Biden and Harris have my vote despite their deplorable records in government. Those records are a primer on what they could do in the most powerful office in the world. I want them to be kept honest about those records.&#160;</p><h2>Biden made bad laws, Harris enforced laws badly</h2><p>Way back when there were <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/everyone-who-is-running-for-president-in-2020-2019-1\">20-something Democratic presidential candidates</a>, I zeroed-in on Biden and Harris as the two I'd least like to see at the top of the ticket.&#160;</p><p>Biden presented himself as America's folksy, work-across-the-aisle, \"get stuff done\" lawmaker. And boy did he get stuff done.&#160;</p><p>Over four decades as a senator from Delaware, Biden <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2019/09/17/the-untold-story-joe-biden-pushed-ronald-reagan-to-ramp-up-incarceration-not-the-other-way-around/\">tried to outdo the Reagan-era Republicans</a> in crafting Drug War legislation. He helped create the role of federal \"<a href=\"https://fee.org/articles/joe-biden-the-architect-of-america-s-disastrous-war-on-drugs/\">drug czar</a>.\" He was instrumental in drafting the mass incarceration-exacerbating <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/us/joe-biden-crime-laws.html\">1994 Crime Bill</a>. He <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/joe-biden-touted-crime-bill-1992-death-penalty-jaywalking-senate-2019-6\">bragged about introducing legislation</a> that did \"everything but hang people for jaywalking.\"&#160;</p><p>Even in the 2000s he was <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/joe-biden-ban-raves-jail-promoters-ecstasy-2001-hearing-2019-6\">the Senate's reliably out-of-touch Democratic narc</a>, pushing to criminalize raves, arrest party promoters, and urging local municipalities to use the \"crack-house legislation\" he co-sponsored in 1986 to bust up parties.</p><p>Most Americans <a href=\"https://www.cato.org/blog/55-americans-favor-decriminalizing-drugs\">now favor the decriminalization of drugs</a> and recognize the damage wrought by mandatory sentencing and mass incarceration.&#160;</p><p>Biden has supported nearly every US military intervention of the past half century (though to his credit, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2016/06/joe-biden-libya-wrong-224595\">he opposed President Obama's intervention in Libya</a>, which proved disastrous).&#160;</p><p>But Biden can't escape the fact that as chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, <a href=\"https://www.jacobinmag.com/2019/07/joe-biden-iraq-war-hawk-presidential-candidate\">he enthusiastically whipped Democratic support</a> for President George W. Bush's invasion of Iraq — unquestionably the US' worst foreign policy fiasco since the Vietnam War.&#160;</p><p>Harris' record isn't nearly as long as Biden's, but that doesn't mean she hasn't notched some dubious feats of her own.&#160;</p><p>Awkwardly selling herself as both a no-nonsense prosecutor and as a woke, hip-hop loving, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/kamala-harris-father-condemns-jamaica-marijuana-joke-2019-2\">former pot smoker</a>, Harris' political career cannot be divorced from her work as a self-described \"top cop.\"&#160;</p><p>Though Harris says as a district attorney and California's attorney general she was a \"progressive prosecutor,\" Harris was, in fact, both tough-on-crime and soft-on-bad cops.&#160;</p><p>As Reason's <a href=\"https://reason.com/2019/06/03/kamala-harris-is-a-cop-who-wants-to-be-president/\">Elizabeth Nolan Brown</a> put it:</p><p>\"Every attorney general fights for state power and police prerogatives. It's part of the job. But over and over again, Harris went beyond the call of duty, fighting for harsher sentences, larger bail requirements, longer prison terms, more prosecution of petty crimes, greater criminal justice involvement in low-income and minority communities, less due process for people in the system, less transparency, and less accountability for bad cops.\"</p><p>As San Francisco's DA, Harris' office <a href=\"https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/sfpd-crime-lab-case-from-a-z/1866446/\">turned a blind eye for years</a> to a corrupt police lab technician whose work resulted in hundreds of convictions. She <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/31/kamala-harris-laughed-jailing-parents-truancy\">aggressively cracked down </a>on parents of truant kids. She <a href=\"https://www.ocregister.com/2019/09/11/kamala-harriss-criminal-justice-reform-plan-cant-be-trusted/\">pushed to bar addicts</a> with prior convictions for selling drugs from Drug Courts, which allow non-violent drug offenders to avoid jail time if they complete a drug rehabilitation program.&#160;</p><p>The progressive-leaning <a href=\"https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:wYvRiW0ARkkJ:https://prospect.org/justice/how-kamala-harris-fought-to-keep-nonviolent-prisoners-locked-up/+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=ust=clnk&#38;gl=us\">American Prospect</a> wrote that as California attorney general, Harris&#160; \"repeatedly and openly defied US Supreme Court orders to reduce overcrowding in California prisons,\" adding that \"Harris and her legal team filed motions that were condemned by judges and legal experts as obstructionist, bad-faith, and nonsensical, at one point even suggesting that the Supreme Court lacked the jurisdiction to order a reduction in California's prison population.\"</p><p>Also as AG, <a href=\"https://californiainnocenceproject.org/read-their-stories/daniel-larsen/\">Harris' office fought to keep an exonerated man in prison</a> because his lawyers had missed a filing deadline, and only freed him from prison once compelled to do so by the courts. Harris' office tried <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-14/kamala-harris-offices-fought-payments-to-wrongly-convicted\">to keep exonerated former prisoners from collecting financial compensation</a> from the state that wrongfully stole years of their lives. Her office was also known to \"<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/08/kamala-cop-record/596758/\">slow roll</a>\" investigations into corrupt or abusive cops and prosecutors.&#160;</p><p>So why am I voting for these ethically compromised, power-hungry career politicians?&#160;</p><p>It's simple: Donald Trump has been president for almost four years.&#160;</p><h2>Look around, this mess is Trump's legacy</h2><p>This isn't 2016 anymore, where we can play \"wouldn't it be nice\" imagination games about how a brash political outsider could shake up the system and rise to the occasion.&#160;</p><p>Much of what was feared about a Trump presidency has come to bear.&#160;</p><p>On his watch, the GOP has decisively abandoned <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/donald-trump-and-the-gop-confirm-their-fiscal-conservatism-was-a-sham\">fiscal conservatism</a> and sat idly while he personally dismantled the alliances that preserved the US-led <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/09/28/donald-trump-unga-liberal-world-order-220738\">post-World War II international order</a>. He has <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-supporters-chant-send-her-back-president-attacks-ilhan-omar-2019-7\">normalized casual racism</a> and <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-broke-brains-conspiracy-theories-obamagate-vote-mail-coronavirus-2020-5\">baseless conspiracy theory-mongering</a>. He has presided over <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/totally-under-control-filmmaker-alex-gibney-trumps-coronavirus-response-2020-10\">the worst national coronavirus response</a> in the developed world, resulting in the deaths of nearly 220,000 Americans.&#160;</p><p>Politics aside, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/former-trump-officials-incompetent-liars-bolton-kelly-mattis-cohn-2020-9\">he's a terrible executive</a>. Trump <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-crazy-stupid-distraction-racism-conspiracy-theories-voters-2020-8\">continues to fail</a> our country by every meaningful metric.&#160;</p><p>As for his boasts of being a great <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/10/16/921662530/trumps-and-biden-s-plans-for-criminal-justice\">criminal justice reformer</a>, Trump deserves credit for championing prison reform by signing the First Step Act. However, Trump's Justice Department is <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/what-first-step-act-and-whats-happening-it\">chipping away at its effectiveness</a>. He also reversed Obama administration policy and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/02/26/trump-administration-says-that-militarizing-police-reduces-crime-is-that-true/\">rebooted the federal government's program</a> of giving excess military equipment to local police departments. Just this week <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/msnbc/opinion/trump-s-praise-extrajudicial-killings-cancels-out-his-law-order-ncna1243591\">he celebrated</a> an extrajudicial police killing. And Trump's as pro-police union — the most immovable opponents of reform — <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/biggest-police-union-fop-endorses-trump-for-president-over-biden-2020-9\">as it gets</a>.&#160;</p><p>That said, wanting Trump gone by any democratic means necessary doesn't mean the Democrats get a pass.&#160;</p><p>Concerns about the Democratic Party taking a hard left turn on economic and social issues are ones I share. We desperately need to address climate change, but the <a href=\"https://www.factcheck.org/2019/03/how-much-will-the-green-new-deal-cost/\">Green New Deal</a> isn't remotely workable in its current form. The growing left-wing trend of using <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/07/20/892943728/professor-criticizes-book-white-fragility-as-dehumanizing-to-black-people\">racial essentialism</a> to achieve \"justice\" is one I wholeheartedly reject. And I think it's positively nuts for liberals to be <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/dont-make-social-media-tech-bro-twitter-facebook-arbiters-truth-2020-5\">calling for billionaire tech bros to be the arbiters of truth</a> online.&#160;</p><p>With hope, I'll be throwing rhetorical rocks at a Biden administration come January 20 and for four years thereafter.

Two crashes, during which pilots struggled to control the plane, resulted in the death of a combined 346 people and led to questions about the plane's design and features.</p><p>Since grounding the plane, Boeing has been working on a complete redesign of the plane's flight software.</p><p>On Friday, Patrick Ky, executive director of the European Union Aviation Safety Agency, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-16/boeing-max-declared-safe-to-fly-by-europe-s-aviation-regulator\">told Bloomberg</a> that he's satisfied with the changes Boeing has made to the aircraft. Ky added that the 737 Max could begin flying in Europe before the end of 2020.&#160;</p><p>American Airlines announced on Sunday plans to fly 737 Max planes between Miami and New York from December 29th through January 4th. The airline said it's taking a \"phased approach,\" and has not confirmed whether it will continue using the aircraft beyond that period. American Airlines' plans are contingent on a green light from the Federal Aviation Administration, which hasn't yet committed to a timeline for approval of the 737 Max.</p><p>Touted as a more fuel-efficient version of the 737 consumer plane, the 737 Max is said to have a longer range, lower operating cost, and enough in common with previous models that pilots could switch back and forth between the two seamlessly.&#160;</p><p>The crashes called into question Boeing's training practices, as well. During the aircraft's rollout, pilots were only required to take a brief tablet-based course, rather than training in a simulator like they would for a new plane.</p><p>A so-called synthetic sensor, a software update demanded by the EASA in 2019, still hasn't been implemented by Boeing, and isn't expected to be ready for another two years. But the EASA says that the plane currently meets safety standards, and the \"third sensor\" would meet even higher safety levels.</p><p>The FAA is Boeing's main regulator, and under international law, the 737 Max won't be able to fly until the FAA allows it. In June, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/boeing-737-max-first-certification-test-flight-faa-jet-2020-6\">Boeing completed its first recertification flight test</a>, one of many steps required before the plane can return to service.</p><h1>There are several ongoing federal investigations and lawsuits&#160;</h1><p>There are several federal investigations underway, looking into the design of the jet as part of an effort to determine how it was allowed to be certified in the first place and whether there was criminal negligence behind the design.

From his willingness to vote for liberal-leaning Supreme Court nominees like Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan to his outspoken criticism of Donald Trump during the 2016 Republican presidential campaign, Graham had universal name recognition, but lacked the strong support of GOP activists compared to fellow South Carolinians like Sen. Tim Scott and former Sen. Jim DeMint.</p><p>Then, Brett Kavanaugh happened.</p><p>In September 2018, the federal judge went through <a href=\"https://www.insider.com/christine-blasey-ford-perspective-senate-hearing-2018-9\">a bruising Supreme Court confirmation battle</a> after being accused of a decades-old sexual assault by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, a California psychology professor. Graham, incensed by attacks on Kavanaugh during the hearings, lambasted Senate Democrats <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_C7o5INBzw\">in a video</a> that went viral. Overnight, Graham had finally become \"one of the guys\" to many conservatives, with President Trump praising him and reelection to a fourth term looking like a sure bet.</p><p>In May 2019, Jaime Harrison entered the Senate race.</p><p>Harrison had a compelling life story as a native son who was raised by his grandparents in Orangeburg and went on to graduate from Yale University and the Georgetown University Law Center. He later worked as an aide to House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn and as a lobbyist in Washington before becoming the first Black chairman of the South Carolina Democratic Party. As a political moderate, he supported Medicaid expansion and raising the minimum wage, while opposing the Green New Deal and an elimination of the Senate filibuster.</p><p>Still, most pundits didn't give Harrison a chance. When he formally announced his run against Graham, he leaned heavily on themes of integrity and loyalty, values that he felt would resonate with voters.</p><p>\"Lindsey Graham can't lead us in any direction because he traded his moral compass for petty political gain,\" Harrison said <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGL5dclzjHo\">in his first campaign ad</a>. \"He's forgotten about the people that he represents...You.\"</p><p>Over the past few months, Harrison's campaign has taken off, pushing Graham into the biggest political fight of his life.</p><h2>\"All Politics are Local\"</h2><p>Late last year, Harrison released an ad where he narrated the story of an older Black man who lived off a dirt road in a rural county. The man told Harrison that until a politician could pave his road, he didn't want to be bothered with an appeal for his vote.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet blockquote\" data-lang=\"en\" data-cards=\"\" data-conversation=\"\">&#8212;Jaime Harrison  (@harrisonjaime) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mims/statuses/1191464056500166656?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 4, 2019</a></blockquote><script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script><p>&#160;</p><p>Harrison has campaigned on local concerns, seeking to revitalize communities across the state, preserve rural hospitals and expand access to educational opportunities. Lately, he has also been discussing ways to better handle the coronavirus pandemic that has left nearly 750,000 South Carolinians out of work.</p><p>He has drawn a sharp contrast with Graham, while increasing his own visibility in the process.</p><p>\"Our infrastructure is falling apart and we don't have broadband in our rural communities,\" Harrison told Business Insider in an interview. \"This is the song that we've been singing since we announced. Senator Graham just hasn't focused on these issues...He likes to play Washington political games. 'All politics are local' is true. You want someone with an ear to the ground and who understands the hardships that people are going through.\"</p><p>\"Senator Graham doesn't have that,\" he added.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f811aefbab422001979a94f?format=jpeg\" alt=\"graham-2\" height=\"2800\" width=\"3733\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Sen. Lindsey Graham gives a speech on Capitol Hill.\n<p class=\"copyright\">AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Harrison also said that there's a trust factor that's gone, further severing a relationship with voters that once allowed Graham to win comfortably with the state's moderate Republicans and independents. Where Graham <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4772923/user-clip-sen-graham-ran-term-limits\">once supported Congressional term limits</a> and previously stated that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/vanitaguptacr/status/1307153104941518848\">presidents should not appoint</a> Supreme Court justices in presidential election years, he has now served in the Senate for 18 years, in addition to his 8 years in the House of Representatives, and he's on the cusp of successfully pushing through the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett less than a month before the November election.</p><p>\"He has not been honest with the people of this state,\" Harrison said. \"People appreciate you saying you've changed your mind if you just admit it...I believe that a man is only as good as his word.\"</p><h2>The Kavanaugh Effect</h2><p>In July 2015, when Graham and Trump were primary rivals for the GOP presidential nomination, Graham <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/25/magazine/lindsey-graham-what-happened-trump.html\">called Trump</a> a \"jacka--\" in an interview. Trump responded by <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-lindsey-graham-phone-number-2015-7\">reading out Graham's cell phone number</a> on live television.&#160;</p><p>Five years later, Graham is now a reliable supporter of Trump's agenda and has become a confidant and occasional golf partner to the president, with their relationship strengthened by the Kavanaugh hearings as well as Graham's role as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.</p><p>Danielle Vinson, a professor of Politics and International Affairs at Furman University, said that the Kavanaugh hearings contributed to the erosion of Graham's standing throughout the state.</p><p>\"His defense of Kavanaugh certainly played well among conservatives, but it did not play well with liberals and women,\" she said. \"It felt like he was dismissing the allegations. A number of groups realized that he's [Harrison's] a quality challenger who knows the state and could register their frustrations.\"</p><p>This week, Graham will attempt to shepherd Barrett's Supreme Court nomination through the Senate in the face of a coronavirus pandemic that has killed over 3,500 South Carolinians since March.</p><p>Harrison is opposed to the Barrett nomination, criticizing the \"rushed\" timeline that Graham himself crafted.</p><h2>A Changing State</h2><p>The last Democratic presidential nominee to win South Carolina was Jimmy Carter, a former governor from neighboring Georgia, in 1976. In 1998, Ernest \"Fritz\" Hollings won reelection to his sixth and final Senate term, the last time a Democrat was elected to a statewide federal office in South Carolina; that same year, Democrat Jim Hodges was elected governor and since leaving office in 2003, no one from his party has won the Governor's Mansion. Democrats last won a statewide office in 2006 and have been the minority party in both houses of the South Carolina General Assembly for years.</p><p>Republicans have been dominant in the state since the mid-1990s and Graham has never received less than 54% of the vote in any of his three general elections. In November, Trump is strongly favored to carry the state once again.</p><p>Harrison, who has never held elective office, is tasked with figuring out how a South Carolina Democrat can actually win statewide in 2020.</p><p>\"I don't see a lot of [conservative] Greenville County Republicans voting Democratic,\" Vinson, the professor, said. \"But I could see the Charleston crowd supporting Harrison. [US Representative] Joe Cunningham has already won that area as a Democrat.\"</p><p>Cunningham, a moderate, was elected to the GOP-friendly 1st congressional district in 2018, a major upset in a district that had not sent a Democrat to Congress for 38 years.&#160;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f843373bab422001979aba1?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Charleston-1\" height=\"2532\" width=\"3377\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Jaime Harrison will have to perform strongly in the Charleston area to win a statewide race as a Democrat.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Jeffrey Greenberg/Universal Images Group via Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>\"Harrison's got to get the Democratic turnout in Greenville, and he'll have to rack up a lot of votes in Orangeburg, Columbia, the Midlands, and along the [Atlantic] coast to have a chance,\" Vinson said. \"There is still a moral conservative component to the state that won't evaporate anytime soon, but new international industries are locating here. If the state keeps that going and brings in more folks who aren't from this part of the country, it'll make things more competitive.\"</p><p>If Graham were to win, he would need to regain some of his past appeal with suburban voters and pick off independents who may be on the fence about Trump.</p><p>\"I haven't heard a lot of changes of heart in older voters,\" Vinson added. \"I think there are some conservative women who are pressured in general — from Trump's behavior to issues that affect their family like coronavirus. I really don't know how they will decide.\"</p><h2>A Tightening Race</h2><p>Earlier in the year, the few public polls that were released showed Graham comfortably ahead, with many voters unfamiliar with Harrison.</p><p>However, this dynamic had changed considerably by late summer.&#160;</p><p>A Quinnipiac poll <a href=\"https://poll.qu.edu/south-carolina/release-detail?ReleaseID=3670\">released in early August</a> revealed a tied race, with Harrison and Graham both garnering 44% of the vote. In late September, <a href=\"https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2020/09/27/cbs-newsyougov-tight-race-lindsey-graham-south-car\">a CBS News/YouGov poll revealed</a> a close race, with Graham holding a 1% lead (45%-44%). <a href=\"https://poll.qu.edu/south-carolina/release-detail?ReleaseID=3677\">The most recent Quinnipiac University poll</a>, also from late September, showed the race tied once again, with Harrison and Graham both receiving 48% of the vote from a pool of 1,123 likely voters.</p><p>As a result, the nonpartisan Cook Political Report <a href=\"https://cookpolitical.com/analysis/senate/south-carolina-senate/south-carolina-senate-moves-toss\">shifted the race</a> from \"Lean Republican\" to \"Toss Up\" in early October.&#160;Jessica Taylor, the Senate and Governors editor at the Cook Report, wrote that the change demonstrated \"just how fast the GOP majority is slipping away if they have to defend turf like this, and also how much Trump's numbers have fallen across the board.\"</p><p>Another nonpartisan forecaster, <a href=\"http://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/2020-senate/\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"100\" data-uri=\"e341714c1d4fa0efab2ead444e73fcdb\">Sabato's Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia Center for Politics,</a> currently classifies the contest as \"leans Republican.\"</p><h2>Spending Spree</h2><p>The race has brought unprecedented levels of fundraising to the Palmetto State.</p><p>On Sunday, Harrison's campaign announced that they raised $57 million in the third quarter of 2020, a historic amount for a Senate candidate, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/10/11/jaime-harrison-shatters-senate-fundraising-record-for-south-carolina-race-428541\">according to Politico</a>. Harrison shattered the $38.1 million quarterly record set in 2018 by then-Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas in his bid against Republican Sen. Ted Cruz.</p><p>In total, Harrison has raised roughly $86 million for his campaign, while Graham raised about $30 million through June, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-senate-elections-jaime-harrison-beto-orourke-ted-cruz-3303a77121ae9df9bb37df94dcc66bf8\">according to the Associated Press</a>. Graham has not released his third quarter figures yet.</p><p>\"This campaign is making history, because we're focused on restoring hope back to South Carolina,\" Harrison campaign spokesman Guy King said in a statement.</p><p>In September, the huge sums of cash being poured into the race led Graham <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlvfT_SfXY4\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"80\" data-uri=\"ba11813aac6183e50ddaa9d509a71b27\">to make an appeal</a> to supporters on Fox News, where he said that he \"was getting killed financially\" by Harrison, who he predicted \"would raise $100 million.\"</p><p>Graham's camp said that the closeness of the race was attributable to out-of-state donations.</p><p>\"Liberal Democrats from across the country have poured record-breaking amounts of money into South Carolina because of Senator Graham's conservative record of accomplishment,\" Graham campaign Communications Director T.W. Arrighi said in a statement.</p><h2>The Final Weeks</h2><p>For most of 2020, Harrison has held the majority of his campaign events virtually, while Graham has generally conducted in-person events throughout the state. When both men met for their first televised debate at Allen University in Columbia, South Carolina, in early October, Harrison <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/jaime-harrison-uses-plexiglass-partition-at-lindsey-graham-debate-2020-10\">used a plexiglass partition</a> to shield himself from Graham.</p><p>\"Tonight I am taking this [the coronavirus] seriously,\" Harrison said during the debate. \"That's why I put this plexiglass up. Because it's not just about me — it's about the people in my life that I have to take care of as well. My two boys, my wife, my grandmother.\"</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f84a3acc255d800190b960f?format=jpeg\" alt=\"harrison-graham-debate\" height=\"2354\" width=\"3537\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Jaime Harrison, left, and Sen. Lindsey Graham, right, prepare for their first debate at Allen University in Columbia, S.C.\n<p class=\"copyright\">AP Photo/Meg Kinnard</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Ahead of last week's second televised debate, Graham declined to take a COVID-19 test, despite his exposure to Trump and at least two other US senators who all tested positive for the disease. The debate format <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/lindsey-graham-refuses-covid-test-harrison-debate-forces-format-change-n1242805\">was quickly changed</a> from an in-person meeting to two individualized candidate forums.</p><p>Harrison is making Graham's lack of urgency regarding the coronavirus pandemic a major issue of the campaign.</p><p>\"There are a lot of people who liked Lindsey because they thought he could get things done,\" Harrison told Business Insider. \"He brings up the Supreme Court.

Their criticism caught him off guard, and caused him to second guess his decision.</p><p>He reached out to me, a mental strength coach, because he was concerned they might be right — was he experiencing some sort of life crisis?</p><p>Fortunately, he wasn't having a midlife crisis. He was redesigning his life to be more in line with his values. And if he was comfortable with his choices, it was OK if his friends and family disapproved.</p><p>Our sessions involved helping him see that he could be a kind and caring person without being a people-pleaser. He could choose his career and live life on his own terms without caring if everyone approved — and that made him mentally strong, not unkind.</p><p>Here are 10 habits of mentally strong professionals who aren't concerned with what other people think:</p><h2><strong style=\"color: #000000;\">1. They let go of people who aren't interested in them</strong></h2><p>Whether they were ghosted after a third date or their old roommate stops returning their calls, you won't catch a mentally strong person begging anyone to stay in their lives. They don't compromise their values in an attempt to be liked nor do they wish anyone harm if they choose to leave.</p><h2><strong style=\"color: #000000;\">2. They express their emotions in healthy ways</strong></h2><p>Mentally strong people are willing to say things that might not sound cool, like, \"I'm nervous about this,\" or \"I'm sad that this is ending.\" Even when their feelings aren't shared by those around them, they're willing to express their emotions in a healthy way.</p><h2><strong style=\"color: #000000;\">3. They respectfully share their opinions</strong></h2><p>They don't agree with others just to keep the peace. Instead, mentally strong people are willing to share their opinions, but they do so in a respectful way. They're open-minded enough to respect people who don't share their opinions and bold enough to speak their truth.</p><h2><strong style=\"color: #000000;\">4. They use empowering language</strong></h2><p>You won't hear a mentally strong person apologize for taking up space or beg for a chance to speak. But you will hear them use empowering language that exudes confidence in themselves. So rather than say, \"I'm so sorry I won't be able to make it,\" they're more likely to say, \"Thank you for the invitation but I am not able to attend.\"</p><h2><strong style=\"color: #000000;\">5. They establish healthy boundaries</strong></h2><p>Mentally strong people know it's up to them to set the rules on how they want to be treated. When people violate those rules — whether it's a friend who doesn't pay them back or it's a coworker who is patronizing — they speak up and protect their boundaries.&#160;</p><h2><strong style=\"color: #000000;\">6. They show all sides of themselves</strong></h2><p>While they don't necessarily talk to their boss the exact same way as they speak to their old college buddies, mentally strong people don't change who they are just to make other people feel more comfortable.</p><p>They're comfortable in their own skin and aren't afraid to show that they're multi-dimensional people who can appreciate many different things in life.</p><h2><strong style=\"color: #000000;\">7. They experiment</strong></h2><p>They don't confine themselves to certain labels in life — like \"artistic\" or \"shy.\" They're not afraid to experiment with new things, explore new career paths, and meet new people. They know they can grow, change, and become whomever they choose to be over time.</p><h2><strong style=\"color: #000000;\">8. They use empowering language</strong></h2><p>Mentally strong people apologize when they've hurt someone. But they don't apologize for being human and they don't insist they're sorry just to prevent someone from getting upset.</p><p>They're much more likely to say things like, \"I appreciate your patience,\" rather than, \"I'm so sorry it took me four hours to reply to your email.\" They give themselves permission to be imperfect and use language that empowers them to feel worthy.</p><h2><strong style=\"color: #000000;\">9. They ignore unsolicited advice</strong></h2><p>Mentally strong people don't waste their time arguing with trolls on social media or worrying about criticism from people who don't know them. They turn to their trusted advisors in life when they need guidance, and tune out the unsolicited advice that comes their way.</p><h2><strong style=\"color: #000000;\">10. They own their success</strong></h2><p>While it can feel uncomfortable to hear compliments, mentally strong people are willing to accept them. Rather than minimize positive feedback by saying, \"Oh, it was nothing,\" they own their success. They acknowledge their hard work and effort, and aren't afraid to talk about their skills and talents.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/habits-of-professionals-who-arent-concerned-what-other-people-think-2020-10'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=Lda-FHOM90E:JHoDuLkwVYM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=Lda-FHOM90E:JHoDuLkwVYM:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=Lda-FHOM90E:JHoDuLkwVYM:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=Lda-FHOM90E:JHoDuLkwVYM:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=Lda-FHOM90E:JHoDuLkwVYM:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=Lda-FHOM90E:JHoDuLkwVYM:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=Lda-FHOM90E:JHoDuLkwVYM:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=Lda-FHOM90E:JHoDuLkwVYM:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/Lda-FHOM90E\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 18 Oct 2020 13:00:00 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5f0c818f3f73701540662bc9?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"b7b419d7165c943152e2c98e574cce48","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn9@2020_1/2020/10/18/17-02-03-307_5531638deeae5604.webp","destWidth":1887,"destHeight":1415,"sourceBytes":127668,"destBytes":127668,"author":"insider@insider.com (Amy Morin)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5f0c818f3f73701540662bc9?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn9@2020_1/2020/10/18/17-02-03-307_5531638deeae5604.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn36@2020_6/2020/10/18/17-02-32-732_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=Lda-FHOM90E:JHoDuLkwVYM:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn64@2020_3/2020/10/18/17-02-32-125_71f22eb6ec903726.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=Lda-FHOM90E:JHoDuLkwVYM:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn31@2020_3/2020/10/18/17-02-25-396_1507bf7b21d76826.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn19@2020_6/2020/10/18/17-02-26-187_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=Lda-FHOM90E:JHoDuLkwVYM:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn59@2020_6/2020/10/18/17-02-36-524_f0be1c2533c4ddb5.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/Lda-FHOM90E":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn8@2020_3/2020/10/18/17-02-18-458_e105eeba2dbad17f.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603040520900},{"createdTime":"2020-10-19 01:02:00","updatedTime":"2020-10-19 01:02:00","title":"The Tesla trade is the best way to invest in a solution to global warming","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-trade-invest-in-a-solution-to-global-warming-2020-10","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f64c098323fc4001e0d7119?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Tesla Model 3_8\" height=\"1667\" width=\"2500\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The Tesla Model 3 is one of four vehicles Tesla is selling.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Tesla</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>The green economy looks set to grow in the coming decade, as governments and businesses strive to address global warming.</li>\n<li>At the moment, it's hard to have enough expertise to invest in the opportunity, given how complicated it is.</li>\n<li>Tesla, however, is directly involved in the green sector because it builds and sells only green technologies.</li>\n<li>As a result, it looks like a nice, easy way to do some green investing.</li>\n<li>And Tesla has a track record: investors who bought and held shares after the 2010 IPO have seen a 9,200% return.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>Investing in the green economy is tricky, mainly because environmentally-responsible investments are still fairly esoteric, to people who aren't professionals or committed to doing a lot of research.</p><p>The opportunity is set to grow over the next decade, although the rate of that development is open for debate. If Joe Biden wins the Presidential election in November and the Democrats take the Senate and hold the House, a program of global-warming-fighting legislation could be the biggest story of 2021.</p><p>Outside the US, green opportunities are also picking up. In Europe, both the giant Volkswagen Group and Mercedes-Benz parent Daimler are committing to widespread electrification of new vehicles, anticipating regulatory changes that could spell the beginning of the end for gas-burning cars and trucks.</p><p>Meanwhile, in China, most automakers expect the coming decade to bring market growth that could make the country the world's leader in electrified transportation.</p><p>If you want to invest in this changeover, however, your best bet could be Tesla.&#160;</p><h2>Tesla has a track record and has shed risk in the past year</h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f6baf59e3e7670011716300?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Elon Musk\" height=\"1763\" width=\"2500\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Tesla CEO Elon Musk has become a multi-billionaire due to Tesla stock appreciation.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Odd Andersen/AFP via Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>First, Tesla has a track record of rewarding investors. If you'd bought shares after the company's 2010 IPO, you'd be sitting on a 9,200% return today. And that's if you'd simply used your own money. If you'd bought with leverage, even at a relatively high rate of interest, the prospective amplified return is staggering.</p><p>This all happened with Tesla minting risk at a furious clip, with the stock pitching up and down like a dinghy in a hurricane, and CEO Elon Musk's Twitter habit adding to the chaos. It also happened when Tesla was operating essentially one factory, selling one or two models at a time, struggling to validate a home-solar business, and delivering fewer than 500,000 cars a year.</p><p>Over the next couple of years, Tesla should cross that 500,000 mark, have four assembly plants online (a new US factory in Texas could join the flagship in California, as well as a plant in China and one under construction in Germany). Tesla could also be operating several battery factories by then.</p><p>The valley of mega-risk has been crossed, and because the company sells nothing but green technologies, buying shares is the obvious way to invest in a global warming solution. I'm not saying you should, mind you — just that the strategy is obvious.</p><h2>Risky startups and risky traditional automakers</h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5e600696fee23d68b900fef2?format=jpeg\" alt=\"GM EV Barra\" height=\"1333\" width=\"2000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>GM has major electric ambitions, as CEO Mary Barra detailed in early 2020.\n<p class=\"copyright\">GM</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Other electric-car startups like Rivian, Nikola, and Lucid Motors are far riskier because they haven't brought vehicles to market yet. On the other hand, their shares, if and when they go public, should be cheaper.</p><p>What about established automakers with electric ambitions?&#160;</p><p>Investment professionals have been arguing for years that General Motors, now aiming to produce 22 new electrified vehicles by 2023, is horribly undervalued. But the play there is perhaps to buy GM stock with the hope that the company decides to spin off its electric business, something Wall Street has agitated for but that GM's management has been avoiding.</p><p>Tesla was starting to look pretty expensive after a huge rally at the beginning of the year took shares above $2,000. But a five-for-one stock split in August has brought shares back into reach.&#160;</p><p>Remember, the point here isn't that you're buying an electric automaker or a solar-panel manufacturer. You'd have to think hard about that, as carmakers are great at incinerating capital and, if you survey the sector, it's tough to find anything that's outperformed the markets (save Ferrari). Solar has a history of countries such as China flooding the market with cheap panels and turning the business into a low-margin commodity-like affair.</p><p>The point is that you want to invest in the emergence of a future green economy, and you want to do it without having to sort through green bond funds or socially-responsible ETFs or delving into the complexities of carbon-credit trading.</p><h2>Investing in one company and one stock rather than in an entire sector</h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f888d689e9fe40019009910?format=jpeg\" alt=\"TSLA Chart\" height=\"846\" width=\"1944\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Tesla has delivered a huge return to investors.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Markets Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Tesla offers a straightforward way to do this, with enough risk still embedded in the business to make a substantial return a possibility while not weighing down the opportunity with so much risk that you'd be tempted to bail out if the stock takes a nosedive at some point in the next five years.</p><p>On the other hand, putting all your eggs in one basket carries its own risk. You clearly aren't hedging by investing in the entire sector, taking advantage of broad ingenuity and discounted prices for companies that haven't really broken cover yet.</p><p>I should point out that I've never owned a single share of Tesla.&#160;And to be honest, I'd doubt I'd buy shares of Tesla if journalistic best practices didn't bar me from doings so. I think there are better companies to invest in outside the transportation industry that have more solid revenue and profitability prospects and that aren't attractive due to big swings in their stock prices.&#160;</p><p>However, if you think the future could be greener than the past or present, and you want to wager a few bucks on your hunch, Tesla appears to be one of the best ways to invest in a single company that's representative of the developing green economy.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

Frank Pallone in the letter. \"[The Trump plan] would also needlessly delay funding to states by requiring states to jump through legislative hoops that are simply unnecessary.

It's an extraordinary amount of money. We'd agreed with the Democrats with $75 billion going to testing, contact tracing.\"</p><p>\"What we have been focused on is the language around testing,\" Mnuchin said, adding that the White House will not \"let the testing issue stand in the way.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, the Republicans are still rejecting the large plans proposed by both the House Democrats and the White House, urging instead for a significantly smaller package in the <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/15/mnuchin-says-hell-give-ground-on-virus-testing-in-stimulus-negotiations-with-pelosi.html\">amount of $500 billion</a>.</p><p>The White House did not immediately return Business Insider's request for comment.</p><p>The coronavirus has infected more than 8.1 million people in the United States, according to the latest data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.

fully electric sports car with <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/porsche-taycan-coolest-features-in-production-car-2019-9\">features and specs</a> that aren't found in other electric vehicles

automaker</a>. However, several of these events have been held in locations that don't have a strong enough infrastructure to support the quick recharge of several electric sports cars at once.</p><p>As a result, the automaker, in partnership with <a href=\"https://www.ads-tec.de/en/company/about-us.html\">Ads-Tec</a> — a German hardware and software creator that specializes in \"industrial\" use — has developed a mobile charging unit that can repower several Taycans at once.</p>\n<div id=\"slideshow\">\n\tThe charging truck has a power rating of 3.2 megawatts with its 2.1-megawatt hour battery systems. This allows 10 Taycans to be charged rapidly at once for a total of 30 vehicle recharges until the unit itself needs juice again.\n\t<figure>\n\t<img

Moynihan replied that Bank of America didn't need the capital.</p><p>\"I know, that's why I'm calling,\" Buffett responded, adding that accepting his money would provide stability, a stamp of approval, and a cash cushion.</p><p>Moynihan concurred, and the pair signed a deal less than 24 hours after speaking for the first time.

The warrants could be exercised at any point over the next 10 years.</p><p>The deal terms echoed Buffett's bailouts of Goldman Sachs and General Electric during the 2008 financial crisis.

than when a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/twitter-reels-from-colossal-hack-as-new-details-surface-2020-7\">colossal hack</a> took over the site this past summer.</p><p>On Wednesday, the New York Post, owned by Fox News mogul Rupert Murdoch's News Corp, published a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/new-york-post-hunter-joe-biden-giuliani-red-flags-disinformation-2020-10\">dubious report</a> purporting to show evidence that Hunter Biden, the son of Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden, was in cahoots with a Ukrainian official. You can read a digestible timeline of the erratic series of events spelled out in the article <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/fbi-investigating-hunter-biden-burisma-emails-foreign-intelligence-operation-2020-10\">here.</a> (The FBI is now <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/fbi-investigating-hunter-biden-burisma-emails-foreign-intelligence-operation-2020-10\">investigating</a> whether the emails were part of a foreign intelligence operation.)&#160;</p><p>Though the story was riddled with holes, Republicans swiftly latched onto it as affirmation of conspiracy theories they've long pedaled involving the Biden family and Ukraine. The publication also faced criticism from some who feared the story was designed to spread disinformation ahead of the 2020 presidential election.&#160;</p><p>As users began to share the story on Twitter, the company responded by banning the URL from being tweeted, therefore limiting how many people could read it, without offering an explanation as to why. The company <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-campaign-account-locked-twitter-ny-post-biden-2020-10\">locked</a> the Trump campaign's official Twitter account, @TeamTrump, after it referred to the NY Post story. White House spokesperson Kayleigh McEnany's account was also suspended.</p><p>Facebook's response to the New York Post article was similar: The company said it would restrict the reach of the article on its platform until a third-party fact-checked its contents. However, the article was still <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-new-york-post-hunter-biden-shared-thousands-after-restrictions-2020-10\">shared nearly 300,000 times</a> on the platform following Facebook's announcement, as Business Insider's Paige Leskin reported.</p><p>It wasn't until later Thursday night that Twitter explained itself, saying that it banned the article for violating its policies around how hacked materials are shared. It's the same reasoning given in June when Twitter <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/blueleaks-twitter-bans-ddosecrets-account-published-secret-police-files-2020-6\">banned a group</a> that released a hoard of police documents that were originally obtained by hackers.&#160;</p><p>Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has since <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/twitter-jack-dorsey-blocking-ny-post-hunter-biden-story-wrong-2020-10\">said</a> it was \"wrong\" to ban the NY Post story. But the damage was already done. GOP Senators now <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/senators-to-subpoena-twitter-ceo-dorsey-after-hunter-biden-articles-2020-10\">plan to subpoena Dorsey</a> to testify regarding the issue, and Republicans have more fodder to feed their long-held, <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/anti-conservative-bias-facebook/\">often-disproven</a> belief that Big Tech is biased against conservatives.</p><p>The whole debacle is a prime example of the power that tech platforms wield and the potential danger that can result when they make inconsistent decisions in enforcing moderation policies. The incident also comes in the midst of the most important presidential elections in modern US history.</p><p>Twitter did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.</p><h2>Adding fuel to the partisan fire</h2><p>Social media critics have been calling with greater urgency this year for companies, including Facebook, to make changes that would prevent election interference. Twitter has <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/twitter-changes-election-political-misinformation-policy-2020-10\">taken a series of steps</a> to crack down on the spread of misleading content and has been fighting to consistently limit the spread of disinformation through its moderation policies.</p><p>But Twitter didn't quite showcase said cohesive moderation plan with Wednesday's ban.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f89edcc9e9fe40019009d98?format=jpeg\" alt=\"jack dorsey twitter\" height=\"1334\" width=\"1778\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Jack Dorsey, Twitter CEO, and Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook COO, off camera, testify during a Senate (Select) Intelligence Committee hearing in Dirksen Building where they testified on the influence of foreign operations on social media on September 5, 2018\n<p class=\"copyright\">Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>What Twitter did do was add to a growing fire stoked by President Donald Trump and Republicans that Big Tech and its platforms are biased against conservatives, as <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2020/10/twitters-ban-hunter-biden-story-conservative-bias-paranoia/616726/\">The Atlantic's Kaitlyn Tiffany</a> goes into in much greater depth.</p><p>The right has launched a crusade against the tech industry since Twitter began adding <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-twitter-facebook-social-media-war-executive-order-explainer-timeline-2020-5\">fact-check labels</a> in May to President Trump's tweets in which he touted the baseless claims that mail-in voting will lead to a fraudulent election. The platform has also flagged tweets from the president that contained <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/twitter-blocked-trump-campaigns-tweets-sharing-false-covid-19-claims-2020-8\">false information about the coronavirus</a>, including a tweet in which <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/twitter-labels-trump-tweet-saying-he-has-coronavirus-immunity-as-misleading-2020-10\">Trump falsely claimed immunity</a>.</p><p>During a July congressional hearing — where the leaders of Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon were grilled over antitrust concerns — Republican lawmakers made it a point to question the CEOs over anti-conservative bias, a topic that has nothing to do with antitrust laws.</p><p>Twitter and Facebook's crackdown on the New York Post story also prompted the president and other GOP officials to <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/new-york-post-hunter-biden-trump-facebook-twitter-section-230-2020-10\">double down on their call</a> to repeal Section 230, an internet law that shields social media firms from being liable for content posted on their sites. In response, the director of the FCC said he would <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/fcc-section-230-reform-trump-puppet-ajit-pai-2020-10\">examine rolling back the protections</a>.</p><p>Following the New York Post incident, Twitter has said it would change its policy regarding the sharing of hacked material. It now will only remove such content if it's shared directly by hackers to the website, not if it is included in a report published by a news publication. But cybersecurity <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/twitter-ny-post-hunter-biden-hacked-material-rules-exploitation-2020-10\">experts also told</a> Business Insider's Isobel Asher Hamilton that Twitter's altered policy contains loopholes, ones that could make it easier for hackers to exploit the rules.</p><p>Like Twitter's unprecedented decision to fact-check Trumps' tweets in May, the company's decision to ban the NY Post article — even if it was rooted in good faith to protect the integrity of Twitter's sharing policies — will likely continue to have a ripple effect, especially as the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/doj-asks-congress-to-weaken-section-230-2020-9\">crusade against Section 230</a> continues.&#160;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/what-happened-twitter-ny-post-biden-moderation-policies-2020-10'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=csLPoEQrUgE:ueTgqlRK7mo:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=csLPoEQrUgE:ueTgqlRK7mo:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=csLPoEQrUgE:ueTgqlRK7mo:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=csLPoEQrUgE:ueTgqlRK7mo:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=csLPoEQrUgE:ueTgqlRK7mo:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=csLPoEQrUgE:ueTgqlRK7mo:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=csLPoEQrUgE:ueTgqlRK7mo:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=csLPoEQrUgE:ueTgqlRK7mo:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/csLPoEQrUgE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 18 Oct 2020 12:18:00 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5f89d3afd260780019341dfa?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"c44b7c3b75226f48832d30a0afd7bdaf","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn8@2020_3/2020/10/18/17-02-15-364_bb42beade0ced6d6.webp","destWidth":1788,"destHeight":1341,"sourceBytes":126148,"destBytes":126148,"author":"insider@insider.com (Katie Canales)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5f89d3afd260780019341dfa?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn8@2020_3/2020/10/18/17-02-15-364_bb42beade0ced6d6.webp","https://i.insider.com/5f89edcc9e9fe40019009d98?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn48@2020_1/2020/10/18/17-02-33-670_c1088dd5b2d67552.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn36@2020_6/2020/10/18/17-02-32-732_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=csLPoEQrUgE:ueTgqlRK7mo:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn47@2020_3/2020/10/18/17-02-32-832_3cba030063da8403.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=csLPoEQrUgE:ueTgqlRK7mo:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn24@2020_1/2020/10/18/17-02-18-953_0359dd12b91639fe.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn19@2020_6/2020/10/18/17-02-26-187_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=csLPoEQrUgE:ueTgqlRK7mo:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn15@2020_5/2020/10/18/17-02-24-391_deac98998dc8d89b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/csLPoEQrUgE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn11@2020_3/2020/10/18/17-02-27-846_71d11a6b25634ce9.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603040520914},{"createdTime":"2020-10-19 01:02:00","updatedTime":"2020-10-19 01:02:00","title":"The Republicans are fundamentally unserious people","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/gop-mcconnell-trump-fundamentally-unserious-people-coronavirus-aid-bill-2020-10","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f89bd6fd260780019341d62?format=jpeg\" alt=\"trump dance campaigning virginia\" height=\"512\" width=\"1024\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Drew Angerer/Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>If it feels like nothing is getting done in America right now, that's because there isn't.</li>\n<li>In large part that is because the Republican Party is made up of unserious people, only interested in perpetuating their own power.</li>\n<li>The President cannot be taken seriously when he says he wants to make a deal &#8212; any kind of deal.

The thoughts expressed are those of the author.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>It's hard for the government to get anything done in this critical moment in American history, and the reason for the disastrous gridlock is simple: Republicans are fundamentally unserious people.</p><p>There's a pandemic raging, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak-business-jobless-claims-united-states-economy-f904abdb3bc24f01e757915eb01a377a\">898,000 Americans</a> filed for unemployment benefits just last week, and the stock market is convulsing because Washington can't pass an economic stimulus bill. The Democrats passed a more than $3 trillion plan in the House in June, while Senate Republicans have argued since this summer that we don't need a large scale bill.</p><p>And no matter what the headlines claim about back and forth between the White House and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the Senate GOP's position hasn't changed either — and that's all that matters. Senate Leader Mitch McConnell has said he will spend no more than $500 billion on a \"targeted\" (some may say \"paltry and inadequate\") stimulus bill to combat the pandemic, and he plans to bring such a doomed bill to the floor of the Senate.</p><p>If it feels like there's some action on this front, it's only because the Trump White House is negotiating with House Speaker Pelosi like a pig on LSD. Trump has said he wants an even bigger bill than the one House Democrats passed. Of course, such a bill does not exist, he hasn't done much to whip votes for such a bill with fellow Republicans, and since the president is lagging in the polls he has little leverage over McConnell.</p><p>Talking to the White House is a waste unless it can move McConnell (unlikely). And McConnell's bill likely won't <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/stimulus-package-mcconnell-senate-supreme-court-confirmation-2020-10\">provide aid to hurting state and local governments</a>, so it's a no-go with Democrats. These are not serious negotiations, because the Republicans are not serious about this issue — or really anything else.</p><p>The only thing Republicans <em>seem</em> serious about doing is appointing judges, not just in the Supreme Court — where some polls show their rush confirmation of Judge Amy Coney Barrett has met <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-ginsburg-poll/majority-of-americans-including-many-republicans-say-wait-for-election-to-replace-ginsburg-reuters-poll-idUSKCN26B0TN\">widespread disapproval from Americans</a> — but in courts all over the country.</p><p>That is because appointing judges and creating a conservative judicial system perpetuates their power. So Republicans are working fast, appointing more <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/07/15/how-trump-compares-with-other-recent-presidents-in-appointing-federal-judges/\">judges to appeals courts</a> than any president since Carter. But even there, the GOP is not taking things that seriously — making the power grab obvious. Trump has also <a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/ABA_ratings_during_the_Trump_administration\">nominated more judges rated \"not qualified\"</a> by The American Bar Association (ABA) to the bench than any President since 1989 (when the ABA started keeping track).</p><p>Aside from all that, you won't see Republicans get much done aside from cutting taxes. The GOP is a party without a plan or a platform (at this year's RNC it presented one thing as its platform — Donald Trump.) It has no ideas, no vision for the future of America, no policy proposals, no ambitions beyond maintaing power for itself and those who support it. That is why it is more than useless at a time when we desperately need to get things done, it's dangerous. This Republican Party will put its own aspirations for power ahead of the public good.</p><p>The GOP's shallowness extends beyond the pandemic to issues it used to champion. Think Republicans are serious about the rule of law? Just this week the Department of Justice was forced to admit that an investigation into whether or not Obama administration spied on the Trump campaign gleaned nothing. Trump had been crowing that Attorney General Bill Barr would announce something as an October Surprise for the Trump campaign. But lo, here is October and the evidence has not materialized.</p><p>How about national security? The Washington Post reports that Barr and others in the Trump administration have <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/giuliani-biden-ukraine-russian-disinformation/2020/10/15/43158900-0ef5-11eb-b1e8-16b59b92b36d_story.html\">known that Rudy Giuliani</a> was involved in a Russian intelligence operation, feeding misinformation to the President. They aren't serious people, though, so they didn't do anything about it.</p><p>Republicans don't have a plan to replace Obamacare or an idea of how to keep people with preexisting conditions covered if the Supreme Court agrees with the Trump administration and strikes down the law,&#160;because they are not serious.</p><p>Republicans do not have a plan to distribute a coronavirus vaccine when it shows up because they are not serious. And we don't know the truth about the president's health right now because Republicans are not serious.</p><p>Now, perhaps you think that Pelosi should just come to some kind of deal with the White House, and see if Trump will take time off from ranting on Twitter and calling in to Fox News to whip the votes for an aid bill that could pass the House. In a normal administration this might be the right course of action. But Trump's administration and his Republicans are not normal.

While the president himself is a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/coronavirus-covid19/21497221/donald-trump-covid-19-coronavirus-news-misinformation-study\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">significant, high-profile source</a> of online COVID-19 misinformation, he is not the only one creating and spreading it. And though alerting users to misinformation is an important step, Twitter offers few tools for knowledgeable users to combat abundant and sometimes <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/04/trump-bleach-coronavirus/610690/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">deadly misinformation</a>&#160;spreading on the platform.</p><p>This spring, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1241155701822476288\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Twitter released information</a> about a special verification process for physicians and public health leaders that aimed to empower credible and credentialed individuals with various types of health expertise to disseminate and evaluate emerging information on COVID-19.</p><p>Twitter began <a href=\"https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/about-twitter-verified-accounts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">verifying certain user accounts</a>&#160;in 2009 as a means of combating impersonation, saying \"An account may be verified if it is determined to be an account of public interest. Typically this includes accounts maintained by users in music, acting, fashion, government, politics, religion, journalism, media, sports, business, and&#160;<a href=\"https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/about-twitter-verified-accounts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">other key interest areas.\"</a>&#160;A verified Twitter account is marked with a small blue checkmark next to the user's name.</p><p>We hoped this special verification process was the beginning of an effort to combat misinformation about COVID-19 by crowdsourcing expertise to verified health experts. The three of us, along with many other physicians and experts, were verified under this program.</p><p>But despite using verification to elevate credible voices to share essential information about COVID-19, these efforts have not meaningfully reduced the spread of misinformation. In fact, verified experts who came across misinformation and tried to identify it as such by replying to or quoting the tweet may have unwittingly amplified it. This strategy has essentially amounted to watering the garden without pulling the weeds. The result has been that users still cannot easily tell the difference between a tweet that is simply widely shared from one that is credible.</p><p>Both&#160;<a href=\"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2020/updating-our-approach-to-misleading-information.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Twitter</a>&#160;and&#160;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/false_news\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Facebook</a>&#160;have rules against sharing misinformation as well as internal systems to flag or remove tweets that violate their rules. Facebook, relying on artificial intelligence and human fact-checker review,&#160;<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/08/11/facebook-covid-misinformation-takedowns/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reported this week</a> that it has removed seven million posts containing COVID-19 misinformation and applied warning labels on another 98 million. These systems, however, can be <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/10/09/921791419/tiny-changes-let-false-claims-about-covid-19-voting-evade-facebook-fact-checks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">easily evaded</a>&#160;and have not come close to solving the problem on any platform.</p><p>On Twitter, which has already made the effort to verify the expertise of some of its users, there is an obvious opportunity to try something new: Let verified experts report COVID-19 misinformation. This would result in more flagged-content reports for Twitter to sort through.</p><p>A key difference between these and reports of other types of abuse — spam, harassment, hate speech, threats of violence, misleading information about an election, and the like — is that these reports would be generated by users already verified as health experts. With the ability to report tweets to Twitter as COVID-19 misinformation, experts can identify them without amplifying the message.</p><p>Tweets that have been reported to contain clear misinformation, such as those denouncing the benefits of social distancing, mask use, or the existence of the virus at all, should be quickly marked as such when discovered. Because existing internal systems have proven to be incompletely effective, Twitter could tap into the verified expertise of some of its users to let other users know they are looking at a tweet that contains misinformation — a weed instead of a flower.</p><p>Clearly, the label of \"misinformation\" must be applied with caution, and only in situations where there is clear scientific consensus. We are not advocating for censorship, just the ability for expert users to identify instances of the 2020 equivalent of falsely yelling \"Fire!\" in a crowded theater.</p><p>Twitter has been a useful platform for discussion in areas of active scientific debate, and it would be a terrible mistake to use misinformation labels to stifle conversation in areas where there is no clear-cut scientific consensus. The platform has previously found ways to exercise judgment in marking other types of rule violations, such as labeling tweets containing misleadingly edited videos as \"Manipulated media\" and placing fact-checking flags to link users to accurate information about voting. We trust that judgment could be similarly exercised with COVID-19 misinformation in accordance with existing rules and clearly delineated criteria for what constitutes misinformation.</p><p>While we appreciate Twitter's attempt to elevate important public health information during the pandemic, we see a missed opportunity to curb misinformation. As physicians and avid Twitter users, we value the ability to communicate directly with patients and colleagues in a public forum. Educating and learning from the public is an important aspect of our work as physicians and subject-matter experts, and while verification enhances our ability to fulfill that mission, we need tools beyond a blue checkmark to do our part to slow the spread of misinformation.</p><p><em>Christopher M.

homepage for more stories</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>In&#160;<a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/topic/business\" data-ga-category=\"autotag-linking\" data-ga-label=\"ai-metadata\" data-ga-action=\"/topic/business\">business</a>, if you've heard it once, then you've heard it a thousand times —&#160;<a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/topic/time\" data-ga-category=\"autotag-linking\" data-ga-label=\"ai-metadata\" data-ga-action=\"/topic/time\">time</a>&#160;is&#160;<a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/topic/money\" data-ga-category=\"autotag-linking\" data-ga-label=\"ai-metadata\" data-ga-action=\"/topic/money\">money</a>. But just&#160;<em>how much</em>&#160;money? If you're freelancing or consulting, how do you figure out just what you're worth to other people?</p><h2>The alternative to the comparative, hourly default</h2><p>To start, you might be tempted to just use a per-hour rate. You might look at what others make for similar work to set that rate for yourself.</p><p>However, this isn't a great solution. You'll quickly hit a ceiling in terms of production, because&#160;there are only so many hours in a day to do the real work&#160;<em>and</em>&#160;all the un-billable, behind-the-scenes tasks involved like&#160;<a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/topic/marketing\" data-ga-category=\"autotag-linking\" data-ga-label=\"ai-metadata\" data-ga-action=\"/topic/marketing\">marketing</a>. And let's not forget that some clients like paying only a flat fee based on whether you finish a specific task, and that some projects will vary widely in terms of what's required of you.&#160;</p><p>To accommodate different situations and make sure you don't limit yourself to only selling your hours, you want to focus instead on finding something that's both scalable and in fantastic demand by a huge number of people. For example, I once did an analysis that looked at billionaires and how they're distributed —&#160;this showed that the biggest&#160;<a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/topic/wealth\" data-ga-category=\"autotag-linking\" data-ga-label=\"ai-metadata\" data-ga-action=\"/topic/wealth\">wealth</a> or demand areas are housing, clothing, food, energy, and computers.&#160;</p><p>Now, the products or services within those areas might look very different in the future. But those basic categories aren't going anywhere. So, find a niche within these groups where you can scale and scale and scale —&#160;the cloud is a great example. As you keep scaling up over time and your sales increase, your monetary value will get higher, too. And, to find that value at any given point along the way, all you have to do is divide your earnings by how much billable time you've put in.&#160;</p><p>Let's look at an example. Let's say you're the CEO of Company Awesome. You're pulling in $100,000 a year. And let's assume that you're lucky to get 1,000 billable hours per year out of the 2,000 you could work. Doing the math ($100,000/1,000 hours) means you're worth $100 per hour. Similarly, if you're running a $200 million company and get in 1,200 billable hours, then your value is $200 million/1,200, which is a cool $166,666 per hour.</p><h2>Every minute counts</h2><p>Now, let's step back for a second. Yes, this simple formula lets you figure out what you could stand to earn. That's great for financial planning and living the way you want. But the bigger lesson is that every minute counts. When you understand what the true monetary value of your time is, you're not going to waste the hours of your day. It's easier to see that fooling around or being inefficient really does cost you, and that it's monetarily beneficial to be as professional as possible.</p><h2>The value of your team and experts</h2><p>You can apply these ideas to your workforce, too. For instance, if you can attribute $500,000 in gains to somebody on your team and they worked 1,000 hours for you, then they've got an hourly value of $500. Don't shortchange them. Every worker, regardless of level, deserves to understand what they're worth to the business, and you should reevaluate pay regularly to ensure that you're treating everybody fairly based on how the company's doing. If that value doesn't go directly into a paycheck, then they need to be able to see how you are reinvesting on their behalf to provide real security, safety, and personal opportunity. Otherwise, they might assume that you're simply lining your own pockets.</p><p>In the same way, when you bring in an expert and their rate looks absurd, take a pause. Think about how their work has translated into profits, market share, or other assets at other businesses. If that yield is high, they might be well justified in asking for a particular rate. Or conversely, if you do your homework and find out that the yield is just ho-hum, you might be justified in negotiating a lower rate or just moving on to somebody else.</p><p>The only truly limited resource that everyone has in common is&#160;<em>time</em>. Every moment you have matters. When you understand the worth of those moments based on earned yearly income and billable hours, you can keep yourself more accountable and advocate for yourself financially with confidence. And when you know the value of others' time, it's easier to treat them with fairness and respect, too. So, do the math. The equation is simple, and the unquantifiable benefits are free.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-set-rates-calculate-true-value-of-time-2020-10'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=Hz4BraBPvOY:7QOIic6DzmM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=Hz4BraBPvOY:7QOIic6DzmM:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=Hz4BraBPvOY:7QOIic6DzmM:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=Hz4BraBPvOY:7QOIic6DzmM:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=Hz4BraBPvOY:7QOIic6DzmM:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=Hz4BraBPvOY:7QOIic6DzmM:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=Hz4BraBPvOY:7QOIic6DzmM:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=Hz4BraBPvOY:7QOIic6DzmM:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/Hz4BraBPvOY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 18 Oct 2020 13:05:00 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5f8a15a3d260780019341fbe?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"a61ea52061537c6848dfcfacc319088d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn35@2020_1/2020/10/18/17-02-36-945_2c8900b7e51d8f94.webp","destWidth":5333,"destHeight":4000,"sourceBytes":514728,"destBytes":514728,"author":"insider@insider.com (Stu Sjouwerman)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5ea1a1635bd7a55bee200ef8?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn31@2020_5/2020/10/18/17-02-27-090_0b6ed21bd491de5c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn36@2020_6/2020/10/18/17-02-32-732_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=Hz4BraBPvOY:7QOIic6DzmM:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn36@2020_2/2020/10/18/17-02-21-360_47509e43db412d1a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=Hz4BraBPvOY:7QOIic6DzmM:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn39@2020_6/2020/10/18/17-02-29-084_bf899c86fbbdd1bf.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn19@2020_6/2020/10/18/17-02-26-187_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=Hz4BraBPvOY:7QOIic6DzmM:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn68@2020_3/2020/10/18/17-02-26-718_66fa337af9e04cb9.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/Hz4BraBPvOY":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn12@2020_4/2020/10/18/17-02-24-345_11ae78b70eae1baa.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603040520900},{"createdTime":"2020-10-19 01:02:00","updatedTime":"2020-10-19 01:02:00","title":"This $103,190 tiny home on wheels was a true product of the pandemic after the company pivoted during lockdown — see inside the 'Dark Horse'","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/dark-horse-tiny-home-on-wheels-designed-pandemic-2020-9","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f6a044757b7da001ee13058?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Dark Horse tiny home\" height=\"1666\" width=\"2222\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The Dark Horse tiny home.\n<p class=\"copyright\"><a href=\"https://www.buildtiny.co.nz/dark-horse\" target=\"_blank\">Build Tiny</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>Build Tiny unveiled its latest tiny home on wheels: <a href=\"https://www.buildtiny.co.nz/dark-horse\">the $103,190 Dark Horse</a>, which was designed and constructed during the pandemic.</li>\n<li>The single-level Dark Horse has a bedroom, living room, kitchen with a breakfast bar, and a dual-purpose laundry and bathroom.</li>\n<li>The conception of the Dark Horse came when two of Build Tiny's customers backed out of projects amid the pandemic, leaving the team of builders with a gap in their schedule.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>Build Tiny has unveiled its latest project: <a href=\"https://www.buildtiny.co.nz/dark-horse\">the Dark Horse</a>, an approximately $103,190 tiny home on wheels that was designed and constructed during the pandemic.</p><p>Build Tiny specializes in, you guessed it, building custom tiny homes that sit on trailer chassis. This one in particular has a bedroom, living space, kitchen with a breakfast bar, and a dual purpose laundry and bathroom.</p><p>But unlike most of the New Zealand-based company's little homes on wheels, the Dark Horse wasn't created for or named by a client. Instead, it was designed and built in-house by the team of builders that then had to come up with and vote on its name, the latter a task that's normally delegated to the client.</p><p>\"The thinking behind it is ... a 'dark horse' is a term usually used to refer to someone that was previously taken for granted, but rose to prominence in a situation — something akin to an underdog success story,\" <a href=\"https://www.buildtiny.co.nz/our-people\">Build Tiny's director and designer Gina Stevens</a> told Business Insider in an email interview. \"That's how we view ourselves as a company in some ways, and also the tiny house is quite unassuming from the outside, but has a few surprises on the inside.\"</p>\n<div id=\"slideshow\">\n\tThe naming and building anomaly was a result of New Zealand's coronavirus-induced lockdown in mid-March that caused Build Tiny to temporarily shutter production efforts.\n\t<figure>\n\t<img

class=\"copyright\"><a href=\"https://www.buildtiny.co.nz/dark-horse\" target=\"_blank\">Build Tiny</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t\n\tDuring this time, two of its clients pulled out of their plans to order a tiny home, leaving only three units in the workshop instead of the typical five.\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f6a050257b7da001ee13066?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Dark

Tiny</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t\n\tAs a result, by the time the company could resume operations eight weeks later, the builders had two \"gaps\" in their work schedule.\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f6a04b957b7da001ee13060?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Dark Horse tiny home\" height=\"1669\" width=\"2225\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The Dark Horse tiny home.\n<p class=\"copyright\"><a href=\"https://www.buildtiny.co.nz/dark-horse\" target=\"_blank\">Build Tiny</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t\n\tIn order to fill this gap, Stevens designed the Dark Horse, allowing the company to introduce a new tiny home while giving the builders something to work on.\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f6a04c457b7da001ee13062?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Dark

Tiny</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t\n\tThis process differs from Build Tiny's normal workflow, which is often based on custom orders as requested by clients.\n\t<figure>\n\t<img

class=\"copyright\"><a href=\"https://www.buildtiny.co.nz/dark-horse\" target=\"_blank\">Build Tiny</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t\n\tAnd often times, these orders are for double instead of single level homes.\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f6a05ac323fc4001e0d7aff?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Dark Horse tiny home\" height=\"1874\" width=\"2499\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The

fulfillment and delivery delays when the lockdown was first lifted, the company is now back on schedule.\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f6a04d1323fc4001e0d7af3?format=jpeg\"

target=\"_blank\">Build Tiny</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t\n\tAnd with the help of New Zealand's COVID-19 Wage Subsidy, Build Tiny was able to pay its employees 80% of their wage even through lockdown.\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f6a06f7323fc4001e0d7b17?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Dark Horse tiny home\" height=\"1666\" width=\"2222\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The Dark Horse

[another build for one of the company's directors], we would have had to reduce the working hours for our build team,\" Stevens wrote. \"However, had this occurred, we would have had the government wage subsidy to fall back on again ...\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f6a04dd57b7da001ee13064?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Dark Horse tiny home\" height=\"1669\" width=\"2225\"

tiny home.\n<p class=\"copyright\"><a href=\"https://www.buildtiny.co.nz/dark-horse\" target=\"_blank\">Build Tiny</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t\n\tAccording to Stevens, a typical design process for a client-requested build can take over two months.\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f6a0687323fc4001e0d7b0d?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Dark Horse tiny home\" height=\"1874\"

Tiny</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t\n\tBut because the Dark Horse was designed in-house based on \"general feedback, wants, and wishes [they] have observed from the New Zealand market,\" the design was finalized in a few weeks.\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f6a04eb57b7da001ee13065?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Dark Horse tiny home\" height=\"1669\" width=\"2225\"

class=\"copyright\"><a href=\"https://www.buildtiny.co.nz/dark-horse\" target=\"_blank\">Build Tiny</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t\n\tBy implementing a single level instead of the more popular double, the home is more accessible for those who can't walk up stairs or climb up ladders.\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f6a061d57b7da001ee13079?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Dark Horse tiny

Tiny</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t\n\tAnd according to Stevens, this work has paid off: Build Tiny has already seen a \"huge amount of interest\" in the Dark Horse.\n\t<figure>\n\t<img

home due to the pandemic, and that's on top of an existing housing supply crisis here due to sustained population growth and an underinvestment in housing,” Stevens wrote. “There just aren't enough homes for all these returning Kiwis to live in, so more people than ever are now considering tiny homes as a viable option.”\n\t<figure>\n\t<img

the cut &#8212; are naturally curious people who like solving problems and can learn as they go.</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">Wang has also figured out how to quickly identify candidates who probably won't

href=\"https://www.inc.com/betsy-mikel/google-looked-for-1-personality-trait-when-hiring-its-early-employees.html\">Google</a>&#160;get their pick of top talent. The world's most profitable tech companies offer&#160;<a href=\"https://www.inc.com/betsy-mikel/googles-former-head-of-hr-says-this-is-why-many-top-performers-quit.html\">competitive compensation packages</a>&#160;and attract the industry's best and brightest candidates.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">So who ultimately makes the cut?</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Ask that question to Nancy Wang, who's been a hiring manager for both companies. She used to be a product manager for Google Fiber. Currently, she's a senior manager for Amazon Web Services. Wang is also the founder and CEO of Advancing Women in Product, a non-profit organization that aims to empower more women and under-represented groups to become tech leaders.</p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">What makes successful candidates stand out from so-so ones</h2><p dir=\"ltr\">\"The most successful candidates I've seen are naturally curious,\" she wrote on&#160;<a href=\"https://www.quora.com/session/Nancy-Wang-28/1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Quora</a>. \"What is most important is their ability to pick things up quick and their 'can do' attitude.\" Just like&#160;<a href=\"https://www.inc.com/betsy-mikel/to-hire-all-star-employees-steve-jobs-looked-for-1-non-negotiable-quality.html\">Steve Jobs</a>, Wang looks for problem solvers and who can learn as they go.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Wang says expertise is only one part of the hiring puzzle. It's not related to how smart a candidate is, what degrees she has, or which top-tier university he did or didn't go to. Wang believes there's only so much knowledge one person can have. And in an interview, it's not fair to assume the candidate is an expert on everything. Being able to dive in and let your curiosity lead you to finding answers will help a new hire be successful at any job.</p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">Candidates with one red-flag trait are less likely to get hired</h2><p dir=\"ltr\">In her experience hiring for Amazon and Google, Wang has figured out how to quickly identify candidates who probably won't work out. Know-it-alls tend not to do well at either company.<iframe width=\"1\" height=\"1\" frameborder=\"0\" data-google-container-id=\"2\" data-load-complete=\"true\"></iframe></p><p dir=\"ltr\">\"What worries me during interviews is when candidates purport to know something and then when I dig deeper, the whole house of cards start falling apart,\" Wang writes.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">No matter what their level, employees need to be leaders. And leaders need to be able to be comfortable asking questions if they don't know something. They also need to admit when they're wrong.</p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">The strategic interview question that weeds out the know-it-alls</h2><p dir=\"ltr\">The personality trait that worries Wang in&#160;interviews is one that&#160;<a href=\"https://www.inc.com/betsy-mikel/heres-how-to-spot-an-egocentric-jerk-in-first-15-minutes-of-an-interview.html\">Boxed CEO Chieh Huang&#160;</a>also avoids. He wants to hire people who are comfortable being honest about what they don't know. Those people tend to be better collaborators and more pleasant to work with.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Huang even has an interview question that gets to the heart of overconfidence: He asks people to rate their knowledge of technology trends on a scale of 1 to 10. He doesn't believe anyone who answers with a 9 or a 10, because no one can know everything.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">\"The reality is, the whole industry is shifting and no one knows what's going to happen in the next 10 years — no one,\" explains Huang. &#160;<br><br></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><em>This article was originally republished by Business Insider in April 2019.</em></p><div

This October, it is time to bring some awareness to the awareness industry.&#160;</p><h2>The corporate beginnings of Breast Cancer Awareness Month</h2><p>It comes as no surprise that National Breast Cancer Awareness Month was originated by a multinational pharmaceutical company.</p><p>In the 1980s, Zeneca Inc. (now AstraZeneca) partnered with the American Cancer Society as they began the awareness campaign in conjunction with a breast cancer screening program at the company.</p><p>The costs to the drug company of running the early detection program <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0033563032000160981\">were estimated to be</a> $400,000. The total costs to the company if they chose <em>not</em> to run the program were estimated to be around $1.5 million. It was simple math.</p><p>While AstraZeneca has since added that \"the health of women is also a motivating factor,\" BCAM was conceived by a company that not only profits from the epidemic, but<a href=\"https://bcaction.org/our-take-on-breast-cancer/patients-before-profits/\"> may be contributing to its cause</a>. The recognizable symbol and money-maker of breast cancer – the pink ribbon – was attached to it shortly after.</p><p>Born from a desire for profit, the current state of Breast Cancer Awareness Month continues in this tradition.&#160;</p><h2>Most corporations participating in BCAM don't even donate to the cause</h2><p><a href=\"https://bcaction.org/the-cancer-industry/\">On its website</a>, the activist group Breast Cancer Action writes: \"The cancer industry consists of corporations, organizations, and agencies that diminish or mask the extent of the cancer problem, fail to protect our health, or divert attention away from the importance of finding the causes of breast cancer and working to prevent the disease.\"</p><p>The money trail of funds allocated to cancer research is nearly impossible to track, because any company can put a pink ribbon on its products with no oversight.</p><p>Even so, organizations like Susan G. Komen or Avon Cosmetics, say they have <a href=\"https://ww5.komen.org/\">invested millions, or even billions</a>, of dollars into breast cancer research. But <a href=\"http://breastcancerconsortium.net/resources/topics/research-dollars/\">where does the money actually go</a>? <br><br>Because there are <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2018/10/17/17989624/pinkwashing-breast-cancer-awareness-products-profit\">no federally mandated rules</a> for marketing campaigns, Gayle Sulik, author of \"Pink Ribbon Blues: How Breast Cancer Culture Undermines Women's Health\" told Vox News that, \"it is up to only consumers to hold companies accountable.\"</p><p>Reebok, in <a href=\"https://thinkbeforeyoupink.org/resources/before-you-buy/\">one of many examples</a>, marketed a line of pink ribbon footwear. Though it promoted the fact that some of their pink ribbon product sales would be donated to the Avon Breast Cancer Crusade, they set a limit of $750,000 — regardless of how many shoes were sold.&#160;</p><p>More duplicitous are the companies who participate in October activities, while actively producing cancer-causing chemicals and carcinogens, like <a href=\"https://www.warriorsinpink.ford.com/\">car companies that cause pollution</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/17/why-are-makeup-companies-able-to-give-breast-cancer-patients-toxic-products\">toxins in cosmetics</a>.</p><p>In terms of NGOs, it has been <a href=\"https://www.marieclaire.com/politics/news/a6506/breast-cancer-business-scams/\">well-documented</a> that millions in donor funds have been spent on 'awareness' events and salaries, instead of research.</p><h2>BCAM capitalizes on breast cancer without actually helping&#160;</h2><p>You may say: \"So what?\" Beyond inevitable corporate greed, isn't this better than nothing? Some money is going somewhere useful, it's bringing attention to a deadly disease, and — at the very least — it provides people with a sense of community.</p><p>This process is a usual product of capitalism, similar to the recent corporate <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/corporations-companies-black-lives-matter-invest-police-racism-inequality-2020-7\">co-optation of the Black Lives Matter</a> movement or the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/6/25/17476850/pride-month-lgbtq-corporate-explained\">usage of the pride flag</a> to sell merchandise. It is cyclical and works to uphold the status quo because it doesn't delve any deeper than \"awareness\" — which is essentially devoid of any real meaning - all in the name of profit.</p><p>The prevalence of corporate \"pinkwashing\" also contributes to the sexualization and gendering of the disease: with slogans like <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/and-while-im-at-it-who-ev_b_8258164\">\"Save the ta-tas</a>\" and \"Squeeze a boob, save a life\", which inherently trivializes the harrowing bodily violence endured by cancer patients.</p><p>In actuality, the normalization of observing breast cancer through pink-tinted glasses not only allows for the commodification of and profiting off a disease, it ensures distraction from the actual problem at hand: that the breast cancer epidemic is a social justice issue.</p><p>BCAM campaigns brush over the fact that the price of cancer treatments, for example, is <a href=\"https://www.cancer.org/latest-news/study-shows-us-cancer-drug-costs-increasing-despite-competition.html\">increasing at a faster rate in the US</a> compared to any other country (disproportionately affecting low-income patients). Or that the Affordable Care Act, which covers millions of people with preexisting conditions — including breast cancer — is in jeopardy.</p><p>There are also pervasive racial disparities related to lack of quality care, which awareness campaigns conveniently ignore. While Black women are less likely to develop breast cancer, they are 40% more likely to die from it than white women, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/dcpc/research/articles/breast_cancer_rates_women.htm\">according to</a> the CDC.</p><h2>The heart of the issue isn't early detection</h2><p>But what about \"early detection\" as a form of healthcare? (The favorite motto of the Breast Cancer Awareness Month–believers).</p><p>The importance of the mammogram <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4462532/\">has been hotly debated</a> — and while early detection is useful, it can lead to chronic <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24451829/\">over-treatment</a> coupled with <a href=\"https://pinkribbonblues.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Ehrenreich-2001-WelcomeToCancerland-Harpers.pdf\">unnecessary biopsies and stress</a>. Early detection also does not mean a patient will have a better chance of living, or being cured.</p><p>And despite the October stress on mammograms and billions of 'awareness' dollars raised for the cause, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/breast/statistics/index.htm\">death rates in the US remain</a> where they were 20 years ago.</p><p>In 1998, breast cancer activist Barbara Brenner <a href=\"https://bcaction.org/2020/05/06/annual-tour-argues-toxins-create-cancers/\">spoke to a crowd in California</a> explaining that the central message of National Breast Cancer Awareness Month — that annual mammograms save lives — is misleading.&#160;</p><p>\"Mammograms and better drugs won't stop cancer rates from rising, but stopping these companies from dumping millions of tons of cancer-causing chemicals into the air and water might.\"</p><p>BCAM ignores and distracts from the structural health and environmental inequalities behind the illness, like <a href=\"https://bcaction.org/our-take-on-breast-cancer/environment/\">toxic chemicals, a lack of chemical regulation policies</a>, and exposure to carcinogens, by putting the onus on the individual: <em>you</em> must get a mammogram, <em>you</em> must buy this pink ribbon to help, <em>you</em> are a fighter, <em>you</em> are a survivor.&#160; Barbara Ehrenreich <a href=\"https://pinkribbonblues.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Ehrenreich-2001-WelcomeToCancerland-Harpers.pdf\">calls this the</a> \"the triumphalism of survivorhood\" that \"denigrates the dead and the dying, a sense in which breast cancer survivors are understood to have somehow fought harder than those who have died.\"</p><p>A practical step before buying those pink shoes this month is to do some research into if and where companies are donating: Is there a cap on their donations? What percentage of their sales goes to a cause that examines underlying social factors? Are they being transparent?</p><p>It seems, at its worst, breast cancer awareness is a marketing tool that works to sanitize suffering. My mother, like thousands of breast cancer patients before and after her, did everything \"right\". She detected early, she went through countless rounds of chemotherapy, radiation, endless nauseating drugs, and a mastectomy.

stocks given what's happened in markets after previous rate increases, according to Goldman Sachs.</p><p>A team of Goldman analysts led by Arjun Menon wrote on Friday that Joe Biden's proposed changes to the corporate tax code would be complemented by an increase in the tax rate applied to capital gains and dividends for the highest income individuals.</p><p>History has shown that capital-gains tax hikes spark stock sell-offs. After the last capital-gains tax rate increase in 2013, the wealthiest 1% of households sold 1% of their starting equity and mutual fund assets, worth about $100 billion today, in the three months leading up to the rate hike, according to Goldman.

year.</p><p>Instead, the government led by Prime Minister Stefan Löfven allowed shops, bars, and restaurants to remain mostly open and students to attend school, to avoid a sharp second spike in cases later in 2020.</p><p>Sweden has recorded a much higher death per population rate than any of its neighbors since adopting this strategy.

Swedes may also be asked to avoid public transport and contact with the elderly and vulnerable.</p><p>\"What's happened in the last couple of weeks is a movement towards a similar model to what has been used in Norway and many other countries,\" he said. \"It's very obvious that it's a new strategy, but still, the newspapers report on 'the Swedish strategy' as if it were fixed in March.\"</p><p>Johan Nojd, who heads Uppsala's infectious diseases department, suggested that he would be prepared to introduce harsher restrictions for the city like new rules for hospitality if the number of cases in the city continued to grow.</p><p>\"Perhaps tomorrow we will have several talking about concerts or restaurants and then perhaps one could say, 'in Uppsala now for two or three weeks it is the Public Health Agency's advice not to sit in restaurants late at night',\" he told the newspaper.</p><p>However, unlike in other countries, there will be no fines or legal consequences for people who decide not to follow any new advice.

that a source familiar with the matter had told them Murdoch believes a Biden victory is most likely, and has even said that the Democrat could triumph over Trump in a landslide.&#160;</p><p>It confirms a report by <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/fox-news-owner-rupert-murdoch-predicts-a-landslide-win-for-biden?ref=home\">The Daily Beast last week,</a> with several sources telling that publication that Murdoch has been projecting an emphatic victory for Biden. According to the report, Murdoch believes Trump has refused to listen to the best advice on dealing with the coronavirus crisis.&#160;</p><p>Business Insider has attempted to reach Murdoch for comment on the report. Murdoch declined to comment on the Times' report.</p><p>And in an email to the Beast last week wrote \"no comment except I've never called Trump an idiot,\" referring to a 2018 report claiming that he had called Trump an \"idiot\" after a phone call with the president about migration.&#160;</p><p>Though Murdoch may believe that it's game over for Trump, Fox News hosts continue to be the president's staunchest media allies. Murdoch's tabloid, The New York Post, is embroiled in controversy over a disputed article last week which, reported that unverified emails found on an abandoned laptop contain evidence of dubious business dealing by Biden's son, Hunter, in Ukraine.&#160;</p><p>Social media companies have moved to limit the article's spread,&#160;<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/biden-laptop-real-fake-russian-intelligence-2020-10\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">with US intelligence reportedly&#160;</a>investigating whether the emails are part of a Russian disinformation campaign.&#160;</p><p>In the initial months of his presidential candidacy, Trump faced tough questions from Fox News hosts and was described as an <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rupertmurdoch/status/622558129742573568?s=20\">embarrassment by Murdoch in a tweet.</a></p><p>But as his campaign gathered strength, the network abruptly changed its stance and became his ardent backer, with network hosts such as Sean Hannity serving as informal advisers and sounding boards for the president.</p><p>Trump has repeatedly praised the Murdoch family. In January&#160; he <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/trump-praises-murdoch-family-compliments-disney-deal-1269939\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">described Murdoch as \"the greatest\"</a> over his deal-making acumen,&#160;</p><p>But according to the Beast, Rupert Murdoch is beginning to tire of the president. Trump has phoned the media tycoon to complain about what he sees as negative coverage about his administration on Fox News.&#160;</p><p>A rift has opened in the Murdoch family over the editorial direction of the publications.&#160;<a

attorney general in a consumer fraud case where they are accused of defrauding potentially thousands of people out of more than $1.6 million.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.azag.gov/press-release/ag-brnovich-files-consumer-fraud-lawsuit-against-debt-collectors\">Attorney General Mark Brnovich said </a>&#160;Mark Anthony Smith and Deborah Ann Butler of impersonating authorities and using fake phone numbers that appeared to come from courthouses, jails, and sheriff's offices for debts they weren't authorized to collect on.</p><p>Smith and Butler threatened to freeze bank accounts, suspend driver's licenses, garnish wages, take away tax returns for possibly thousands of unpaid debts, <a href=\"https://www.azag.gov/sites/default/files/docs/press-releases/2020/complaints/Complaint_against_Mark_Smith_and_Deborah_Butler_2_.pdf\">according to a criminal complaint</a>. They have also been accused of masking their real phone numbers with those of courthouses and sheriff's offices more than 65,800 times to convince people that the calls were legitimate.</p><p>Smith and Butler operated under the company names CMS Financial Group, John Lee Group &#38; Associates, and TD Financial Solutions Group AZ.</p><p>The lawsuit comes as a result of an investigation by the attorney general, the Federal Trade Commission, and more than 50 other federal and state law enforcement agencies. Victims of the scams had filed complaints with the FTC, Better Business Bureau, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.</p><p>The lawsuit calls for the defendants to pay restitution of $1.6 million to victims and $31.7 million in fines. Smith and Butler would also face a lifetime ban from working in debt collection.</p><p>There have been <a href=\"https://public.tableau.com/profile/federal.trade.commission#!/vizhome/DebtCollection/Infographic\">more than 86,000 complaints filed in 2020</a> related to debt collection, according to the FTC. About 45% of those complaints relate to abusive and threatening debt collection practices and calls about debts not owed.</p><p>In September, the FTC <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/regulators-crack-down-on-aggressive-dubious-debt-collectors-2020-9\">announced Operation Corrupt Collector</a>, a nationwide crackdown on debt collection scams. Currently, the effort involves more than 50 actions from the FTC and state cases filed by law enforcement in 16 states including Arizona, California, Massachusetts, North Carolina, and New York.</p><p>There are several red flags to identify debt collection scams. Authorized debt collectors are not allowed to threaten jail time or pose as a government official, <a href=\"https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0258-fake-and-abusive-debt-collectors\">according to the FTC</a>. They're also not allowed to harass people with repeated phone calls. Debt collectors must verify the debt by providing information like the name of the original creditor and the total amount owed.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/debt-collection-scam-arizona-attorney-general-2020-10'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=ddn12CRxaiw:jj1hfFVVBsY:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=ddn12CRxaiw:jj1hfFVVBsY:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=ddn12CRxaiw:jj1hfFVVBsY:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=ddn12CRxaiw:jj1hfFVVBsY:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=ddn12CRxaiw:jj1hfFVVBsY:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=ddn12CRxaiw:jj1hfFVVBsY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=ddn12CRxaiw:jj1hfFVVBsY:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=ddn12CRxaiw:jj1hfFVVBsY:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/ddn12CRxaiw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 18 Oct 2020 15:08:00 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5f8c5797c21cfb0019468a75?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"e60a3ca8b6151e4045f0a200f7fba9f5","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn72@2020_2/2020/10/18/17-02-16-937_702549967f9b9e93.webp","destWidth":1707,"destHeight":1280,"sourceBytes":107008,"destBytes":107008,"author":"sbalogh@businessinsider.com (Shannen Balogh)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5f8c5788c21cfb0019468a74?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn60@2020_4/2020/10/18/17-02-33-029_332ca541888fc7b6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn36@2020_6/2020/10/18/17-02-32-732_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=ddn12CRxaiw:jj1hfFVVBsY:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn59@2020_6/2020/10/18/17-02-21-772_6aad970c2d76270b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=ddn12CRxaiw:jj1hfFVVBsY:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn52@2020_5/2020/10/18/17-02-35-534_b2e1d95fd2e803a5.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn19@2020_6/2020/10/18/17-02-26-187_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=ddn12CRxaiw:jj1hfFVVBsY:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn39@2020_6/2020/10/18/17-02-26-416_11798eff76934ea2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/ddn12CRxaiw":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn100@2020_2/2020/10/18/17-02-25-966_5be9429e5d4d7aed.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603040520883},{"createdTime":"2020-10-19 01:02:00","updatedTime":"2020-10-19 01:02:00","title":"Flippy, the $30,000 automated robot fast-food cook, is now for sale with 'demand through the roof' — see how it grills burgers and fries onion rings","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/miso-robotics-flippy-robot-on-sale-for-300000-2020-10","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f89c377d260780019341d96?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Team Member Next to Flippy ROAR at the Fryer_3\" height=\"3024\" width=\"4032\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Flippy.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Miso Robotics</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>Miso Robotics' kitchen robot, Flippy, just became available to purchase for $30,000.</li>\n<li>Flippy can cook 19 items, including burgers and hash browns.</li>\n<li>Flippy works as a kitchen assistant, moving along a rail.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>Robots can flip burgers and fry sides, and Miso Robotics is selling its burger-flipping robot as the perfect fry cook for the COVID-19 era.</p><p>Robot assistant Flippy just became commercially available for <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/2020/10/06/you-can-now-order-miso-robotics-latest-kitchen-robot-for-30000/\">$30,000</a>, or on a payment plan, with plans to eventually lower the price.

Not only does cash assistance not cause folks to drop their employment, but it helps them navigate and prepare for future emergencies better than other other forms of aid. With hyper partisan gridlock preventing Americans from receiving badly needed stimulus checks, this moment gives us pause to consider cash as a permanent part of the social safety net.&#160;</p><p>In November 2016, devastating wildfires destroyed approximately 1,300 residences leaving local families in emotional and economic crisis. Dolly Parton and the My People Fund pledged to provide $1,000 per month for six months to each family who lost their homes. Here's what happened.</p><h2><strong>People don't stop working when we give them money</strong></h2><p>Despite receiving $1,000 per month for five months and a $5,000 cash transfer at the end of the program, recipients maintained employment and their regular work hours.&#160;</p><p>One of the most prevalent myths of cash transfers or guaranteed income is that receiving cash assistance disincentivizes folks from working or maintaining their level of employment.&#160; Our results indicate that this myth is false — recipients maintained about the same amount of employment and work hours before and during disbursement of the monthly $1,000.&#160;</p><h2><strong>People are better able to prepare themselves for future trouble when they have an income floor&#160;</strong></h2><p>Reported savings rates and amounts of savings to weather a future financial emergency increased substantially from the first to second observation. As with many forested areas on the West Coast, the next wildfire emergency in East Tennessee is a matter of <em>when, </em>not if, so having emergency savings in preparation for future wildfires is invaluable.&#160;</p><p>While the wildfires in 2016 were especially deadly and destructive, a major wildfire emergency happens in the Gatlinburg/Sevier County area of Tennessee about every decade or two, and climate change patterns hold important implications for longer, dryer summers and greater risks of future wildfires.</p><h2><strong>Folks are better able to manage emotional challenges when finances are more stable</strong></h2><p>Following the fires, there was a sharp increase in reported symptoms of depression and anxiety in the sample. However, there was a parallel rise in reported treatment-seeking behaviors for those symptoms.&#160;</p><p>Results indicated that wildfire survivors had higher rates of reporting symptoms of depression and anxiety, and the rate of reporting symptoms was sustained across time, even during and after receiving cash transfers. The good news though, was the parallel rise of reported treatment-seeking, such as going to therapy or the doctor to treat depression and anxiety.</p><h2><strong>Cash works best</strong></h2><p>In the final survey, recipients were asked which form of assistance was most helpful (other forms included donations from charity and churches, services from Red Cross and disaster relief, donated goods from friends and family, etc.) and the majority of respondents reported that the monthly cash transfers were the most helpful form of support above all others. With this, the study concluded that cash transfers may be an important, underutilized approach to recovery following an emergency.&#160;</p><p>As a lead researcher on the<a href=\"https://www.stocktondemonstration.org/\"> Stockton Economic Empowerment Demonstration</a> (SEED), the first mayor-led guaranteed income pilot in the country, we weren't intending to look at the impact of GI as traditional disaster relief, but rather its impact on the ongoing emergency of income volatility that folks are living with daily.&#160;</p><p>Though our focuses are different, we are seeing<a href=\"https://seed.sworps.tennessee.edu/\"> similar data</a>. Only 2% of people in the study report they are unemployed and not looking for work. When they began receiving the funds, they<a href=\"https://seed.sworps.tennessee.edu/spending.html\"> spent it</a> how anyone would — on food, merchandise and utilities. And recipients report having been able to prepare for future financial emergencies and navigate the unexpected emergencies<a href=\"https://www.stocktondemonstration.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/COVID-Crisis-Spending-Data-Press-Release.pdf\"> brought on by the pandemic</a>.&#160;</p><p>We are also studying how changes in income volatility alter financial well-being, psychological distress, and physical functioning. We plan to release these data at the culmination of the research in 2021. Though the research is still in progress, anecdotal information provided through the<a href=\"https://seed.sworps.tennessee.edu/spending.html#narrative\"> storytelling efforts</a> demonstrate a positive impact.</p><p>There is legislation introduced for a limited guaranteed income to lift the economy and help Americans weather the pandemic, but now with the second state of emergency 2020 has seen it is clear that folks do not have the financial resilience to navigate emergencies in today's economy, personal or pandemic sized.&#160;</p><p>As we consider solutions to help Americans remain solvent in an era of constant emergencies, we must look at the evidence that supports ongoing guaranteed income as part of the 21st century social safety net.</p><p><em>Stacy Elliott is a Ph.D. student and graduate research assistant for the College of Social Work at the University of Tennessee.

Nikola would pay GM $700 million to engineer and manufacture the Badger, and in turn, GM could show off its Ultium battery in the new truck and collect 80% of the emissions credits for the vehicle. As part of the deal, GM would also be the exclusive provider of fuel cells for Nikola's semi-trucks, excluding Europe.</p><h3><strong>2 days later, Hindenburg Research released the explosive report, \"Nikola: How to Parlay An Ocean of Lies Into a Partnership With the Largest Auto OEM in America\"</strong></h3><p>Hindenburg research announced that it gathered \"extensive evidence\" that it said indicated that \"Nikola is an intricate fraud built on dozens of over the course of its Founder and Executive Chairman Trevor Milton's career\" on Sept. 10. The firm has a short position on Nikola, which means that it stands to profit if Nikola's share price goes down.</p><p><a href=\"https://hindenburgresearch.com/nikola/\">The report said</a> that Nikola made false or misleading claims about having proprietary battery technology, natural gas wells, solar panels, and hydrogen production capabilities. The report also said that while Milton claimed Nikola designed key components of its vehicles in house, the technology actually was licensed or bought from third parties.</p><p>In addition, Hindenburg Research said the Nikola's presentations of its semi-truck, the Nikola One, were \"a total farce.\" During one event, the electric vehicle company claimed that the truck's electrical systems worked, but Hindenburg's report said that there was an electrical cable under the stage secretly powering the truck.</p><p>Nikola also promoted a video of the semi-truck cruising down a road, but Hindenburg's report said that the truck was towed to the top of a hill, and then filmed as it rolled down to make it seem like it had a working motor.</p><p>On Sept. 10, Trevor Milton called the report a \"hit job\" on Twitter, and teased a swift rebuttal. \"Give me a few hours to put together responses to their lies,\" he wrote.</p><h3><strong>Four days after Milton's tweet, Nikola came out with an official statement saying Hindenburg's findings were \"false and misleading,\" while stating that they never claimed that the truck in its promotional video was \"under its own propulsion\"</strong></h3><p>In a statement published September 14, Nikola released a <a href=\"https://nikolamotor.com/press_releases/nikola-sets-the-record-straight-on-false-and-misleading-short-seller-report-96\">detailed response</a> to Hindenburg's report, saying that it \"was designed to provide a false impression to investors and to negatively manipulate the market in order to financially benefit short sellers, including Hindenburg itself.\"</p><p>In response to Hindenburg's claims that Nikola misrepresented third-party technology, specifically inverters, as its own, Nikola said that it had been designing its own inverters, but it \"does use third-party parts in prototype vehicles,\" and that it's \"common practice among vehicle manufacturers.\"</p><p>Responding to Hindenburg's claims that it had faked the capabilities of its Nikola One semi-truck, Nikola didn't dispute the claim that the truck had been rolled down a hill. Instead, Nikola said that they had never claimed that the vehicle was moving \"under its own propulsion\" or \"powertrain driven.\"&#160;</p><p>The next day, Hindenburg wrote that, \"the company debunked nothing,\" in a <a href=\"https://hindenburgresearch.com/nikola-response/\">statement</a> titled, \"We View Nikola's Response As a Tacit Admission of Securities Fraud.\"</p><h3><strong>Regulators, including the SEC and the DOJ, began examining fraud allegations</strong></h3><p>On September 14, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-14/sec-said-to-examine-nikola-over-short-seller-s-fraud-allegations?sref=LspfQlRv\">Bloomberg reported</a> that the SEC was conducting a preliminary review to see if Nikola broke any securities laws. The next day, the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a45a6638-167b-4e27-a9fd-576e7229f959\">Financial Times reported</a> that the Department of Justice was looking into Hindenburg's allegations as well.&#160;</p><p>\"On September 11, Nikola's legal counsel proactively contacted and briefed the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding Nikola's concerns pertaining to the Hindenburg report,\" a company spokesperson told Business Insider on Friday. \"Nikola welcomes the SEC's involvement in this matter.\"</p><h3><strong>Despite the controversy, GM projected confidence about its decision to strike a deal with Nikola on Sept. 15</strong></h3><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f892927d260780019341bfb?format=jpeg\" alt=\"FILE PHOTO: General Motors Chairman and CEO Mary Barra makes a statement as members of the United Auto Workers bargaining committee listen at the start of contract talks between the union and automaker in Detroit, Michigan, U.S., July 16, 2019.

Nikola will also cover Milton's legal fees, under certain stipulations.</p><h3><strong>Later that day, Milton's cousin accused him of sexually assaulting her</strong></h3><p>Aubrey Smith <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/nikola-founder-trevor-milton-cousin-accuses-him-sexual-assault-2020-9\">told Business Insider</a> that Milton assaulted her in 1999, after their grandfather's funeral service. Smith was 15 and Milton was 17, according to prior <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/nikola-founder-trevor-milton-cousin-accuses-him-sexual-assault-2020-9\">Business Insider reporting</a>. Under the guise of giving her a massage, Milton took off Smith's bra without her consent and then groped her, Smith said.&#160;</p><p>In the weeks following Smith's allegation, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/nikola-founder-trevor-milton-second-sexual-assault-allegation-report-2020-9\">another woman came forward</a> accusing Milton of sexual assault, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/29/two-women-file-sexual-abuse-complaints-against-nikola-founder-trevor-milton.html\">CNBC reported</a>. She alleged that Milton digitally penetrated her against her consent in 2004 when she was 15 and he was 22. She was an employee at his security company at the time, her lawyer told CNBC.&#160;</p><p>Milton denied both of the claims in a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/nikola-founder-trevor-milton-second-sexual-assault-allegation-report-2020-9\">prior statement to Business Insider</a>. \"At no point in his life has Mr. Milton ever engaged in any inappropriate physical contact with anyone,\" Milton's representative wrote.</p><p>\"The Nikola Board first learned of these allegations, regarding conduct from before Nikola was founded, from tweets and media reporting that occurred subsequent to the company's announcement that Trevor Milton was stepping aside as Executive Chairman,\" a Nikola representative told Business Insider. \"Nikola has been and remains committed to creating a safe, respectful, and inclusive work environment for all employees and has established policies and procedures to instill these values throughout the company.\"</p><h3><strong>A report surfaces Sept. 26 alleging Trevor Milton purchased the designs for the Nikola One semi-truck, rather than designing it himself \"in his basement,\" as previously claimed</strong></h3><p>The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9bd5e3f3-4d09-458c-b390-bc94b1f4a024?campaign_id=4&emc=edit_dk_20200928&instance_id=22589&nl=dealbook&regi_id=71823306&segment_id=39220&te=1&user_id=f058385abc0a81f5ba25805ecd26bcd9385abc0a81f5ba25805ecd26bcd9\">Financial Times reported</a> that the founder purchased the design for the Nikola One from Adriano Mudri, a designer employed at the Croatian electric vehicle brand Rimac Automobili. Nikola had previously claimed that Milton had created the design for the truck himself in a 2018 lawsuit against Tesla.&#160;</p><p>\"The Nikola One truck was designed and patented by Nikola. It is commonplace to license third-party designs during vehicle development, and although early in the process, Nikola purchased a license to Adriano Mudri's designs,\" a Nikola representative told Business Insider on Friday.&#160; \"He was not part of the design team, and his designs are materially different from the design invented by Nikola for the Nikola One.\"</p><h3><strong>Negotiations are still underway for the deal between GM and Nikola. The companies missed their Sept. 30 initial target date for finalizing the agreement.</strong></h3><p>Nikola's share price has been battered by the fraud allegations, with shares of Nikola down 53% since the partnership was announced, as of Thursday. CNBC's <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/nikola-stock-price-report-general-motors-could-take-bigger-stake-2020-9-1029636618\">Phil LeBeau reported Sept. 30</a> that GM might take a bigger stake in Nikola, given the fact that Nikola's share price has dropped precipitously since the deal was announced. GM's proposed 11% stake was worth about $2 billion when the deal was penned. Now, it's worth less than half that much.&#160;</p><p>\"Our transaction with Nikola has not closed,\" a GM rep said on September 29, according to <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/gm-says-it-is-continuing-discussions-with-nikola-on-alliance-deal-2020-9\">Reuters</a>. \"We are continuing our discussions with Nikola and will provide further updates when appropriate or required.\"</p><p>On Thursday, a Nikola executive \"played down\" the significance of the Badger project, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a93d512e-54b0-41d3-aadb-7a101605fb55\">the Financial Times reported</a>. \"The Badger was an interesting and exciting project to some shareholders, but our institutional shareholders are mostly focused on the business plan,\" said Nikola's CEO Mark Russell, according to the Financial Times. Russell also said Thursday that the Badger wouldn't be built without an OEM partner like GM, according to <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-16/nikola-ceo-says-startup-s-plans-intact-even-if-gm-deal-unravels?srnd=premium&sref=LspfQlRvQlRv\">Bloomberg</a>.

The <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/why-republicans-havent-passed-a-new-covid-19-stimulus-bill-2020-10\">White House and the Republican Senate</a> are divided against each other on the wisdom of fresh spending and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/timeline-covid-19-stimulus-talks-have-gone-for-6-months-2020-10\">unable to reach an agreement with either</a>.&#160;</p><p>While the talks over more immediate spending seem stuck, the case for stimulus is easy to make with the current level of <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/september-jobs-report-nonfarm-payrolls-us-unemployment-rate-economy-recovery-2020-10\">elevated unemployment</a>. But beyond the obvious near-term case, whoever is in the White House on the afternoon of January 20 should take heed from lessons learned from the last four years: unemployment can go lower than previously thought, but maybe only if political leaders are willing to take fiscal deficits past levels previously thought prudent.</p><h2><strong>Taking unemployment even lower</strong></h2><p>Among the broad mainstream of the economics profession, and especially among policymakers in the Federal Reserve, there was a rough consensus from 2014 to 2017 that the economy had reached full employment, or the level of unemployment below which inflation would accelerate and destabilize the economy. Reaching this level meant there was little need for continued monetary policy stimulus and that fiscal stimulus would likely only have meager gains.</p><p>The Fed began to \"lift off\" rates in late 2015 while <a href=\"https://www.barrons.com/articles/the-mystery-of-the-lost-american-workers-1477111139\">many economists theorized</a> that labor force participation <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/bpea-articles/labor-force-participation-recent-developments-and-future-prospects/\">was doomed to decline due to factors outside the economy itself</a>, whether the opioid crisis or demographics.</p><p>\"We are reasonably close to achieving full employment,\" Jerome Powell, now the Fed Chair, <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20161129a.htm\">said in November 2016.</a> Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/14/upshot/q-and-a-with-loretta-mester-optimism-at-the-fed.html?_r=0&abt=0002&abg=1mp;abg=1\">was saying as early as 2014</a> that \"we're getting close to our goal in terms of slack being reduced,\" in the labor market.&#160;</p><p>The debate only heated up in 2017 as Trump and the Republican Congress were contemplating a massive tax cut, largely tilted towards the wealthy and corporations. While not optimally designed as economic stimulus (typically directing money towards those more likely to spend it results in more effective demand-side policy), some Democratic economists and commentators <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/01/opinion/trumps-tax-cuts-may-be-more-damaging-than-reagans.html\">pooh-poohed</a> the policy due to the economy already \"very close to or at full employment,\" as Larry Summers <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/10/17/lawrence-summers-trumps-top-economists-tax-analysis-isnt-just-wrong-its-dishonest/\">put it in October, 2017</a>.</p><p>But unemployment kept on falling, and the labor force participation rate — or the percentage Americans actively in the job market — drifted up.&#160;</p><p>Trump and conservative economists might credit this continued progress to fewer regulations or the tax cuts ability to incentivize investment. But progressive economists — who may have opposed the tax bill for its <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/tax-policy-center-analysis-of-final-trump-gop-tax-reform-bill-2017-12\">decided tilt towards the wealthy</a> — have a simpler explanation: it expanded the deficit, juicing economic growth, and powered the labor market well past the point much of the mainstream thought possible without incurring inflation.&#160;</p><p>So while the Trump administration is more than happy to praise their own tax cuts as stimulative, they also opened up the taps on spending, reaching a budget deal with congressional Democrats in early 2018 that lifted caps imposed by the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/08/us/politics/congress-budget-deal-vote.html\">2011 Budget Control Act by some $300 billion</a>.&#160;</p><p>\"The big difference in 2017 and 2018 relative to the five or six years that came before was that fiscal policy was a lot more expansionary,\" Josh Bivens, an economist at the progressive Economic Policy Institute, told Business Insider.</p><p>\"It wasn't the fiscal policy I would have chosen, but it proved that there was slack in the labor market, we got continued reductions in unemployment without a huge uptick in wage or price inflation,\" Bivens said.</p><p>The timing of the two budget deals points to the tricky politics of fiscal policy going forward. The caps that were undone by Trump and Congress in 2018 were put in place as part of a deal to raise the debt limit in 2011 between the Obama administration and the Republican House Majority. While Republicans seem to waver on their commitment to spending discipline (it certainly gets stronger when a Democrat is in the White House), Democrats are perfectly happy to cut deals with Republican presidents that fund both of their priorities.&#160;</p><p>So while a Biden White House may look favorably on <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/biden-after-rejecting-progressive-spending-plans-now-hones-multi-trillion-dollar-budget-11600075802\">stimulus spending and new government programs</a>, they could be stymied by a Republican majority in either the House or Senate or the deficit skittishness of Democratic senators who would represent the deciding 50th vote for any legislation.&#160;</p><p>And a Biden administration is unlikely to get much, if any, support from Republicans for spending plans. Several Republican senators have already cast doubt on expansive spending proposed by a president of their own party in the midst of a reelection campaign.</p><h2>The Federal Reserve has a role too</h2><p>But fiscal policy does not solely determine the unemployment rate. No matter who wins in November, the Federal Reserve has committed to not making the same mistake of thinking that around 5% unemployment (the level at which it started hiking rates in 2015) is the best the U.S. economy can do even when inflation is below 2%.</p><p>Dallas Fed president Robert Kaplan <a href=\"https://www.dallasfed.org/news/Interviews/int200921\">has suggested</a> that the Fed could keep rates at near zero even if unemployment gets under 4%in the coming years, thanks to their new framework.&#160;</p><p>This would be a big change from the last time the Fed encountered what they thought was a low unemployment rate with quiescent inflation.</p><p>About a year ago, one Fed Governor, Lael Brainard, <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20191126a.htm\">acknowledged</a> that the \"lift off\" of interest rates in 2015 was mistaken, when unemployment was at 5%.</p><p>Since then the Fed's rethinking has been even more comprehensive. In a speech in August, Fed Chair Jerome Powell <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20200827a.htm\">admitted that the</a> \"historically strong labor market did not trigger a significant rise in inflation\" and that these forecasts had been based on estimating an unemployment rate below which inflation would kick up. The Fed's estimate of that rate dropped as continued labor market strength did not prompt inflation from 5.5%in 2012 to 4.1%.</p><p>Today, however, the Fed says that the normal rate of unemployment can't be precisely known and <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcprojtabl20200916.pdf\">have projected</a> that they would not raise rates from their current near-zero level through 2023 with unemployment falling to 4%by then.&#160;</p><p>Charles Evans, the president of the Chicago Fed, said this week that, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/feds-evans-says-new-inflation-framework-would-have-limited-earlier-rate-hikes-11601909145?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=1mp;pos=1\">had the Federal Reserve been operating under its new framework</a>, \"it's highly likely that this strategy would have forestalled raising rates in 2015 and 2016.\"</p><p>The experience of the last few years teaches us what's possible with an expansive fiscal policy even in \"normal\" times, let alone extraordinary ones. Let's hope Democrats have learned this lesson — and Republicans don't forget.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/congress-coronavirus-aid-bill-fiscal-stimulus-gop-democrats-deal-blocked-2020-10'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=xjdYPc_lwFQ:qvs1RAybMOo:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=xjdYPc_lwFQ:qvs1RAybMOo:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=xjdYPc_lwFQ:qvs1RAybMOo:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=xjdYPc_lwFQ:qvs1RAybMOo:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=xjdYPc_lwFQ:qvs1RAybMOo:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=xjdYPc_lwFQ:qvs1RAybMOo:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=xjdYPc_lwFQ:qvs1RAybMOo:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=xjdYPc_lwFQ:qvs1RAybMOo:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/xjdYPc_lwFQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 18 Oct 2020 12:04:00 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5f8b32529e9fe40019009f18?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"28e962d7a784ac1d3aa2790ee087623a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn31@2020_6/2020/10/18/17-02-36-956_9d05ae5fb2d03934.webp","destWidth":3086,"destHeight":2314,"sourceBytes":367536,"destBytes":367536,"author":"insider@insider.com (Matthew Zeitlin)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5f8b3264c21cfb0019468a21?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn3@2020_5/2020/10/18/17-02-24-260_4ed82c54d80f0ced.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn36@2020_6/2020/10/18/17-02-32-732_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=xjdYPc_lwFQ:qvs1RAybMOo:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn39@2020_2/2020/10/18/17-02-21-360_0711b8d8141eb230.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=xjdYPc_lwFQ:qvs1RAybMOo:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn19@2020_6/2020/10/18/17-02-18-992_94d1792f9e40c283.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn19@2020_6/2020/10/18/17-02-26-187_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=xjdYPc_lwFQ:qvs1RAybMOo:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn84@2020_5/2020/10/18/17-02-33-221_87ba07bc4d8a4fd7.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/xjdYPc_lwFQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn52@2020_5/2020/10/18/17-02-24-526_c17582a0f5ef9482.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603040520926},{"createdTime":"2020-10-19 01:02:00","updatedTime":"2020-10-19 01:02:00","title":"The Amy Coney Barrett Supreme Court hearings have finally shattered the illusion of civility in Congress","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/barrett-supreme-court-hearings-broken-congress-civility-norms-rules-2020-10","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f8b0e17c21cfb0019468a06?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Pelosi Schumer Mcconnell\" height=\"1499\" width=\"3000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Mark Wilson/Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>By shoving through the confirmation of Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett, Republicans are once and for all killing the old norms in Congress.</li>\n<li>But this moment is only shattering the illusion of civility, which has been waning for years.</li>\n<li>Democrats have finally recognized this.

The Senate Republicans plan to ram through her nomination on the eve of the election. But this choice, in stark contrast to the supposed \"<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-ruth-bader-ginsburg-elections-us-supreme-court-courts-1c42ab69fe886d1b2133129006918e7f\">precedent\" they set just four years ago</a>, will be the final straw that breaks the illusion that there is any civility left in Washington.</p><h2><strong>To confirm or not to confirm</strong></h2><p>At this point, it's nearly impossible to imagine the vote on Barrett getting delayed until after the election. Senate Democrats need four Republicans to delay, and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/9/19/21447031/susan-collins-ginsburg-no-supreme-court-vacancy-vote-inauguration-day\">only two have stepped forward</a>. A possible silver lining is that confirming Barrett right before the election will take some of the gas from Republican voters and further energize Democrats.&#160;</p><p>The Republican-held Senate seems to have made the decision that they would rather have a sixth seat on the Supreme Court than keep the issue alive to help them with the election. Perhaps they think they'll lose anyway – so this will be a last victory as their <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/us-government-supreme-court-senate-president-represent-minority-views-2019-12\">minority rule</a> comes to an end.&#160;</p><h2><strong>Democrats, look in the mirror</strong></h2><p>Assuming Barrett is confirmed before year-end, Democrats will almost certainly end the legislative filibuster if they win the majority. As Washington and our country have become more divided, the US Senate has broken the norms that by and large made it the house of compromise and civility.</p><p>By some measure, Democrats have themselves to blame. When former President Bill Clinton nominated Ruth Bader Ginsburg to the Supreme Court in 1993, she was the first Justice nominated by a Democrat in more than a quarter century. Indeed, Republican presidents <a href=\"https://www.senate.gov/legislative/nominations/SupremeCourtNominations1789present.htm\">nominated 10 Justices</a> – more than the total number on the court – between Thurgood Marshall and Justice Ginsburg.</p><p>In addition, the <a href=\"https://authors.library.caltech.edu/83761/1/sswp1351%20-%20published.pdf\">Republicans have nominated younger Justices</a> to the court who can serve out their lifetime appointments longer, which has been the strategy for Trump's three nominees. The Republicans have been playing the long game for a long time.</p><p>Gamesmanship on the lower court began to spike when Clinton was president, and the Republican Senate started stalling his judicial nominees. Even conservative Chief Justice William Rehnquist got in the act and rebuked the Senate for its <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/01/us/senate-imperils-judicial-system-rehnquist-says.html\">delay tactics</a>.</p><p>This went back and forth with both sides playing politics until Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid had enough and <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2013/11/harry-reid-nuclear-option-100199\">changed the rules </a>in 2013 to make it easier to confirm judicial nominees. Reid excepted Supreme Court picks from the easier path, but Republicans <a href=\"https://time.com/4728558/neil-gorsuch-filibuster-senate-confirmation-vote/\">changed that</a> too after Trump was elected. Now Trump is on the verge of more Supreme Court appointments than any president since Ronald Reagan.</p><h2><strong>The end of an era</strong></h2><p>With Republican's shameful hypocrisy on full display, Democrats have the opening to take their power to the next level in January. There's no political downside to ending the legislative filibuster, which will allow them to pass laws with a simple majority instead of a three-fifths vote.&#160;</p><p>It's mostly an inside baseball issue: hard to explain and not a kitchen table issue for average Americans. Plus they'll be able to pass a lot of legislation quickly, assuming they hold the House and win the White House. With this final rule change, the Senate will lose the last piece of what traditionally made it the chamber of careful consideration. But the polarization of our nation — <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/1/28/21077888/why-were-polarized-media-book-ezra-news\">amplified by cable news</a> and <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/07/americans-reach-peak-partisan-polarization-under-trump.html\">inspired by our leaders</a> — has brought us to this point.</p><p>Assuming they take this step, Democrats won't get tagged for making the rule change. They'll get tagged for what they do with it and whether they overplay their hand.&#160;&#160;</p><p>There's so much they urgently need to do on racial justice issues, gun safety, health care, prescription drugs, climate, infrastructure and executive branch ethics reform. And they'll want to pass a more aggressive economic support package for citizens, businesses, states and municipalities while the economy flounders in response to the pandemic.&#160;</p><p>If Senate Democrats do eliminate the filibuster, Democratic nominee Joe Biden's first 100 days could be among the most consequential and productive of recent history.</p><p>All of this needs to be done. Ultimately, many <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/democrats-focus-healthcare-economy-issues-not-trump-scandals-2020-2\">Democratic positions are popular</a> among the people. But, if Americans see it as too much too fast, the Democrats will pay a price again.</p><h2><strong>To pack or not to pack</strong></h2><p>While the legislative goals may be generally popular, Democrats biggest question will be whether to pack the Supreme Court — that is adding more justice beyond the current nine — or change lower courts. The issue of packing the Supreme Court is much easier for the average voter to understand – so it has more landmines for Democrats. The Democrats could be painted as retributive for doing it and quickly end up on defense while trying to accomplish their important legislative goals.</p><p>Biden is <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/13/politics/joe-biden-court-packing-not-a-fan/index.html\">not enthusiastic about court-packing</a> because he fears a slippery slope – but he should continue to play his cards close to keep it as a threat to Republicans for pushing through Barrett. He'll also keep the part of the base that wants to pack the court energized.&#160;</p><p>If Barrett is confirmed, five of the nine Justices will have been appointed by <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/supreme-court-justices-president-popular-vote-1156542\">presidents who lost the national popular vote</a> upon taking office. The country needs, at minimum, a balanced Supreme Court. But it deserves – and should demand – a Supreme Court that is reflective of the country. Instead we have Justices pushed through by officeholders without the popular mandate in the hopes that they'll block national reforms and <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/poll-majority-adults-don-t-support-overturning-roe-v-wade-n1241269\">precedents</a> our electorate supports.</p><p>Democrats may end up on the losing side again if they end the legislative filibuster or add seats to the Supreme Court. But the proud hypocrisy of the Senate GOP in filling a Supreme Court vacancy in an election year has made it time for the Democrats to go for it.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/barrett-supreme-court-hearings-broken-congress-civility-norms-rules-2020-10'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=xt2gWl07MgU:QoWjs5IHEgE:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=xt2gWl07MgU:QoWjs5IHEgE:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=xt2gWl07MgU:QoWjs5IHEgE:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=xt2gWl07MgU:QoWjs5IHEgE:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=xt2gWl07MgU:QoWjs5IHEgE:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=xt2gWl07MgU:QoWjs5IHEgE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=xt2gWl07MgU:QoWjs5IHEgE:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=xt2gWl07MgU:QoWjs5IHEgE:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/xt2gWl07MgU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 18 Oct 2020 13:28:00 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5f8b0e0f9e9fe40019009efa?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"27118be57fdd2cf8cc8f6aad88a61111","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn55@2020_6/2020/10/18/17-02-16-924_66d11e04bf55fa71.webp","destWidth":2645,"destHeight":1983,"sourceBytes":98754,"destBytes":98754,"author":"insider@insider.com (Michael Gordon)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5f8b0e17c21cfb0019468a06?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn8@2020_4/2020/10/18/17-02-35-723_a95a25039064f003.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn36@2020_6/2020/10/18/17-02-32-732_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=xt2gWl07MgU:QoWjs5IHEgE:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn53@2020_2/2020/10/18/17-02-19-334_f9477f18eaf17073.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=xt2gWl07MgU:QoWjs5IHEgE:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn3@2020_6/2020/10/18/17-02-33-367_5d769c36ec1db1e1.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn19@2020_6/2020/10/18/17-02-26-187_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=xt2gWl07MgU:QoWjs5IHEgE:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn67@2020_2/2020/10/18/17-02-33-079_e1e2d002f6cf11f6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/xt2gWl07MgU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn27@2020_4/2020/10/18/17-02-25-280_8f52a754fa6d252e.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603040520888},{"createdTime":"2020-10-19 01:02:00","updatedTime":"2020-10-19 01:02:00","title":"Gretchen Whitmer accuses Trump of inciting 'domestic terrorism' after his supporters chanted 'lock her up' at his rally following a foiled plot to kidnap her","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/gretchen-whitmer-accuses-trump-of-inciting-domestic-terrorism-2020-10","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f8c66ce9e9fe40019009f80?format=jpeg\" alt=\"gretchen whitmer\" height=\"1439\" width=\"2880\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Michigan Gov.
