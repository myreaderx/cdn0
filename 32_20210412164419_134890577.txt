But when they do, major cataclysms result. Remember the dinosaurs? </p><p>Add to this the fact that since 1998, scientists <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00641-8\" target=\"_blank\">have detected</a> about 25,000 near-Earth asteroids, while in 2020 alone, a record 107 of them came closer to our planet than the distance to the moon. With so many asteroids floating by, protecting our planet from impacts by these giant space bodies is an existential priority. </p><p>To prepare for the day when an asteroid will be heading our way, a joint <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094576521001028?via%3Dihub\" target=\"_blank\">study</a> published in <em>Acta Astronautica</em> from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (<a href=\"https://www.llnl.gov/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">LLNL</a>) and the Air Force, looked at how to use neutron energy output from a nuclear blast to deflect such a threat. </p><p>The scientists devised sophisticated computer simulations to compare strategies that could divert an asteroid 300 meters in diameter. In particular, they aimed to identify the effects of neutron energies resulting from a nuclear \"standoff\" explosion on the space rock's path. (A standoff detonation involves detonating a nuclear device near a space object — not on its surface.) The goal would be to deflect the asteroid rather than blow it up.</p><p><br/></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n        <img class=\"rm-lazyloadable-image rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"60b99efc0d55fe5e850d93f94353c721\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" data-runner-src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjA0MTgzNi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYyNDM1NDM4OX0.-bXy-m5zDT_JIOPkG4sZpPCss_zKfx1w3kiEHlPWX4w/img.jpg?width=980\" height=\"500\" id=\"55d10\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" width=\"875\"/>\n        \n        \n        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Caption...\">Detonating a nuclear device near an asteroid deposits energy at and below the surface.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Credit...\">Credit: Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory</small></p><p><br/></p><p>The researchers understood that they could affect an asteroid's path by changing the distribution and strength of the released neutron energy. Directing the energy could influence how much melted and vaporized debris could be created and its speed, which in turn would alter the asteroid's velocity. As the authors write in the paper, \"Changing the neutron energy was found to have up to a 70% impact on deflection performance.\" </p><p>The scientists see their work as a stepping stone in continuing research into how best to protect our planet. They plan to devise further simulations in order to comprehend more precisely the energy spread needed for the deflection strategy to work. </p><p>Lansing Horan IV led the research, while getting a nuclear engineering master's degree at the Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT) in a program with LLNL's Planetary Defense and Weapon Output groups. Horan explained that their team decided to zero in on neutron radiation from a nuclear blast because neutrons are more penetrating than X-rays.</p><p>\"This means that a neutron yield can potentially heat greater amounts of asteroid surface material, and therefore be more effective for deflecting asteroids than an X-ray yield,\" he <a href=\"https://phys.org/news/2021-04-neutron-energies-asteroid-deflection.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">shared</a>.</p><p>Another possible strategy for getting rid of an asteroid threat would be through so-called disruption. It essentially involves blowing the asteroid up, breaking it into tiny fast-moving pieces. Most of these shards should miss the Earth but around 0.5% could make it to the surface. The strategy does seem to have some drawbacks, however, if a larger asteroid came close to Earth. Exploding something like that could create a significant amount of calamity for the planet even if the whole asteroid didn't graze us.</p><p>Horan thinks disruption may be more appropriate as a last-minute tactic \"if the warning time before an asteroid impact is short and/or the asteroid is relatively small.\"</p><p>Deflection is ultimately safer and less likely to produce negative consequences as it involves a smaller amount of energy than it would take to explode it. Horan said that over time, especially if we detect and deflect asteroids years before impact, even small changes in velocity should make them miss Earth.</p><p>While some may be understandably worried about using nuclear blasts close to Earth, Hogan sees it as something that may have to be considered in situations when time is of the essence. </p><p>\"It is important that we further research and understand all asteroid mitigation technologies in order to maximize the tools in our toolkit,\" Horan<a href=\"https://phys.org/news/2021-04-neutron-energies-asteroid-deflection.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> elaborated</a>. \"In certain scenarios, using a nuclear device to deflect an asteroid would come with several advantages over non-nuclear alternatives.\"</p><p>One such scenario would be if there's not enough warning and the approaching asteroid is large. In that case, a nuclear detonation might be \"our only practical option for deflection and/or disruption,\" proposed the scientist.</p><div></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/7YTroGO-EwY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Mon, 12 Apr 2021 13:59:54 +0000","feedId":32,"bgimg":"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjA0MTgyNy9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY0OTM5NTY0N30.bqnQXrV8vskuY5z03H0J9xyIFGprBO2T_9mTHh48sWY/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=129%2C0%2C129%2C0&height=700","linkMd5":"b66216a1b3a066b1776759857a51986a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn21@2020_3/2021/04/12/16-44-14-326_249720630d4b9422.webp","destWidth":1245,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":52772,"destBytes":52772,"author":"Paul Ratner","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjA0MTgyNy9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY0OTM5NTY0N30.bqnQXrV8vskuY5z03H0J9xyIFGprBO2T_9mTHh48sWY/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=129%2C0%2C129%2C0&height=700":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn21@2020_3/2021/04/12/16-44-14-326_249720630d4b9422.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/7YTroGO-EwY":null},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618245819896},{"createdTime":"2021-04-13 00:43:39","updatedTime":"2021-04-13 00:43:39","title":"Ancient cave artists were getting high on hypoxia","link":"https://bigthink.com/surprising-science/cave-art-hypoxia","description":"<img src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjAzODQwNi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYyMTMwOTYxMn0.AQflWoABDFzXujmDShpZ_QIQC-uV1GfxMhzZHYf0KeE/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0&height=700\"/><br/><br/><ul class=\"ee-ul\"><li>Hundreds of prehistoric paintings have been found in subterranean chambers with barely enough oxygen to breathe.</li><li><span></span>Low oxygen causes hypoxia that can induce exalted mental states.</li><li>A new study says the artists chose these hard-to-each caverns in search of an oxygen-starved high.</li></ul><hr/><p>Artists of all types have been known to ingest a — shall we say — creative lubricant or two.

Kedar and her colleagues created computer models that revealed the likely levels of oxygen in the painted caves. They found that in some such caverns, oxygen levels can drop to 18 percent in just 15 minutes. Some models fell to 11 percent. Hypoxia is likely at oxygen levels below 14.5% percent.</p><p>Fire torches exacerbate the problem. Up near the surface in a cave open to outside air, a burning fire's exhaust flows up and out while fresh air comes in beneath it. In a narrow passageway, however, the carbon dioxide and oxygen mix, and the lighter oxygen floats upward and on out of the cavern toward the surface.</p><p>The deeper a painter went with their torch, the more extreme was the loss of oxygen. Some of Kedar's models of deep caverns found just 9 percent oxygen, the lower limit of survivability.</p><p>Kedar hopes to validate the modeled outcomes by measuring oxygen levels in existing painted caves. For now though, the models point to the \"transformative nature of an underground, oxygen-depleted space.\"</p><h2>What is a hypoxic high like?</h2><p>Hypoxia releases dopamine and can produce euphoria, visions, and out-of-body sensations. Modern visitors have reported experiencing some of these same sorts of mental phenomena when viewing the artwork.</p><p>The paper suggests that, \"The cave environment was conceived as both a liminal space and an ontological arena, allowing early humans to maintain their connectedness with the cosmos.\" The hypoxic mind may well have found it easy to imagine that they were seeing beyond the rock, and indeed, beyond their world. </p><p>\"The images envisioned in such a hallucinatory state appear to float on the cave surfaces (walls, floors, and ceilings) as if these constituted a membrane connecting the upper and lower worlds,\" write the authors.</p><p>Considering the likelihood of hypoxic conditions inside caves, it may be that it was the promise of a transcendent experience that drove the painters deep into the ground rather than any inherent meaning attached to the caves.

Meanwhile, many old behaviours such as attending events, eating out and seeing friends have been put on hold. </p><hr/><p>However, one old behaviour that has persisted, and <a href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.pcad.2020.04.005\" target=\"_blank\">has arguably been amplified due to COVID-19, is sitting</a> — and it is not surprising to see why. Whether sitting during transportation, work, screen time or even meals, everyday environments and activities are tailored nearly exclusively to prolonged sitting. As such, sedentary behaviours, like sitting, make up the vast majority of our waking day. </p><p>Pre-COVID-19 estimates place the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12966-020-00925-8\" target=\"_blank\">average Canadian adult's sedentary behaviour at around 9.5 hours per day</a>. Current daily sedentary time is likely even higher as a result of stay-at-home orders, limitations on businesses and recreational facilities, and <a href=\"https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/200527/dq200527b-eng.htm\" target=\"_blank\">elevated health anxieties</a>. </p><h2>Health vs. well-being</h2><p>This is a problem, given that chronic excessive levels of sedentary time have been linked to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0105620\" target=\"_blank\">greater risk of diabetes, heart disease, mortality and even some cancers</a>. However, for many people, their own judgments and feelings about their quality of life (also known as <a href=\"https://dictionary.apa.org/subjective-well-being\" target=\"_blank\">subjective well-being</a>) may be more important and relevant for informing their health decisions and behaviours than potentially developing chronic diseases.</p><p>Subjective well-being encompasses <a href=\"https://nobaproject.com/modules/happiness-the-science-of-subjective-well-being\" target=\"_blank\">an individual's own evaluation of their quality of life</a>. It includes concepts like <a href=\"https://dictionary.apa.org/affect\" target=\"_blank\">affect</a> (positive and negative feelings) and <a href=\"https://dictionary.apa.org/life-satisfaction\" target=\"_blank\">life satisfaction</a>. Interestingly, these evaluations can conflict with physical health outcomes. For example, a person could have diabetes but still report good subjective well-being, while someone with no physical health conditions may report poor subjective well-being. </p><p>This is important, as it means how an individual feels about their own health may not always align with what their body may demonstrate. That's why evaluating subjective well-being is vital for painting a holistic picture of health. </p><h2>Different contexts of sitting</h2><p>Relatively little research has examined the relationships between sedentary behaviour and subjective well-being. Exploring these relationships is important, as different contexts of sitting — such as socializing versus screen time — may yield different feelings or judgments of subjective well-being, unlike relationships between physical health and sedentary behaviour, which <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-publhealth-040119-094201\" target=\"_blank\">tend to be more consistent</a>. </p><p>As health psychologists focused on physical activity and sedentary behaviour, we <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychsport.2021.101920\" target=\"_blank\">reviewed the scientific literature</a> describing relationships between measures of sedentary behaviours such as physical inactivity and screen time, and subjective well-being as reflected by affect, life satisfaction and overall subjective well-being. </p><p><a href=\"https://www.sedentarybehaviour.org/2021/03/04/relationships-between-indices-of-sedentary-behavior-and-hedonic-well-being-a-scoping-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Our review</a> highlights three main findings. First, sedentary behaviour, physical inactivity and screen time demonstrated weak but statistically significant correlations with subjective well-being. In other words, those who reported sitting more often and spending longer periods with no physical activity reported lower positive affect, higher negative affect and lower life satisfaction than those who sat less and moved more. </p><p>We also found that this relationship was most apparent in studies that compared people who were very sedentary to those who had more active lifestyles. </p><h2>Not all sitting is bad sitting</h2><p>Our second main finding relates to the context of the sedentary behaviour. While many studies examined overall sedentary behaviour and physical inactivity, some studies looked at specific contexts or domains of sitting and its relationship with subjective well-being. These studies revealed that different domains of sedentary behaviour have unique relationships with subjective well-being. </p><p>For example, screen time was consistently and negatively associated with subjective well-being. However, domains like socializing, playing an instrument and reading actually demonstrated positive associations with subjective well-being. These results differ from the traditional health-related sedentary behaviour research, in which <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-publhealth-040119-094201\" target=\"_blank\">all sedentary behaviour is viewed as harmful to health</a>. </p><p>Our review suggests that some types of sedentary behaviour may be beneficial to quality of life. Rather, not all sitting is the same in terms of subjective well-being. So when people work towards reducing their sitting time, they should consider not just how much to reduce, but what kind to reduce.</p><h2>Less sitting is good for everyone</h2><p>Our third main finding concerns overall sitting and self-perceived levels of sedentary behaviour. Most studies found a weak statistically significant association between higher overall sedentary time and lower subjective well-being. However, in studies where participants were asked to compare their sedentary behaviour to how much they normally sit, those who perceived themselves as more sedentary than usual reported significantly poorer subjective well-being.</p><p>These findings suggest that how much an individual sits overall may not be as important as how much an individual sits compared to their usual level of sitting. This infers that anyone, regardless of how much they normally sit or <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(16)30370-1\" target=\"_blank\">are physically active</a>, may potentially benefit from sitting less.</p><p>COVID-19 continues to influence daily life and routines. Even as businesses and gyms eventually reopen, and we feel more comfortable gathering with others and eventually stop wearing masks, we will almost certainly continue to sit and sitting will continue to change how we feel. While we may not be able to eliminate all of our sitting, we can all be mindful of both how much we can reduce it and where we can reduce it from to be healthier <em>and</em> feel better.<img alt=\"The Conversation\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/156289/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic\" width=\"1\"/></p><p><a href=\"https://theconversation.com/profiles/wuyou-sui-1024154\" target=\"_blank\">Wuyou Sui</a>, Postdoctoral fellow, Behavioural Medicine Lab, School of Exercise Science, Physical & Health Education, <em><a href=\"https://theconversation.com/institutions/university-of-victoria-1182\" target=\"_blank\">University of Victoria</a></em> and <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/profiles/harry-prapavessis-1115239\" target=\"_blank\">Harry Prapavessis</a>, Professor, Kinesiology, <em><a href=\"https://theconversation.com/institutions/western-university-882\" target=\"_blank\">Western University</a></em></p><p>This article is republished from <a href=\"https://theconversation.com\" target=\"_blank\">The Conversation</a> under a Creative Commons license.

And fans are now picking sides.</p><hr/><p>Even the most fantastical creatures have some basis in scientific reality, so the natural world is a good place to look to better understand movie monsters. <a href=\"https://www.formorphology.com/\">I study</a> functional morphology – how skeletal and tissue traits allow animals to move – and evolution in extinct animals. I am also a huge fan of monster movies. Ultimately, this is a fight between a giant reptile and a giant primate, and there are relative biological advantages and disadvantages that each would have. The research I do on morphology and biomechanics can tell us a lot about this battle and might help you decide – #TeamGodzilla or #TeamKong? </p><h2>Larger than life</h2><p>First it's important to acknowledge that both Kong and Godzilla are definitely far beyond the realms of biological possibility. This is due to sheer size and the laws of physics. Their hearts couldn't pump blood to their heads, they would have temperature regulation problems and it would take too long for nerve signals from the brain to reach distant parts of the body – <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/godzilla-king-of-the-monsters-movie-size-too-big-2019-5\">to name just a few issues</a>.</p><p>However, let's assume that somehow Godzilla and Kong are able to overcome these size limitations – perhaps because of their radiation exposure they have distinctive mutations and characteristics. Based on how they look on the big screen, let's explore the observable differences that might prove useful in a fight.</p><h2>Kong: the best of ape and human</h2><p>At first glance, Kong is a colossal primate - but he's not simply a giant gorilla.</p>\n        <p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n        <img alt=\"Kong has a mix of both gorilla and humanlike physical traits.\" class=\"rm-lazyloadable-image rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"1eb26a54f1eb117553aad0ef96991a9a\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" data-runner-src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjAzODQ2Ni9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY1MDc3NDM4NX0.16lYmKa-rUc-DYeoYLOp3I-B0Cwmsfh1CMdar9AsaJk/img.jpg?width=980\" height=\"1200\" id=\"d466d\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" width=\"800\"/>\n        \n        \n        <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Credit...\">Cliff/Wikimedia Commons, CC BY</small></p>\n        <p>One of the most striking things about Kong is his upright, bipedal stance – he mostly walks on two legs, unlike any other living nonhuman apes. This ability could suggest close evolutionary relationship to the only living upright ape, humans – or his upright stance could be the result of <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/terms/convergent_evolution.htm\">convergent evolution</a>. Either way, like us, Kong has thick muscular legs geared toward walking and running, and large free arms with grasping hands, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhevol.2012.04.001\">enabling him to use tools</a>.<br/></p><p>Humanity's bipedal, upright posture is unique in the animal kingdom and provides a slew of biomechanical abilities that Kong might share. For example, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms9416\">human torsos are highly flexible</a> and particularly good at rotation. This feature – in addition to our loose shoulder girdle – makes <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/how-humans-became-the-best-throwers-on-the-planet-131189\">humans the best throwers</a> in <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1098/rsbl.2007.0107\">the animal kingdom</a>. Throwing is helpful in a fight, and Kong could probably <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/nature12267\">throw with the best of them</a>.</p><p>Kong is also, of course, massive. He absolutely dwarfs the largest known primate, an extinct orangutan relative called <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/ajpa.23150\"><em>Gigantopithecus</em></a> that was a bit bigger than modern gorillas.</p><p>Kong does have many gorillalike attributes as well, including long muscular arms, a short snout with large canine teeth, and a tall sagittal crest – a ridge of bone on his head that would be the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/joa.12609\">anchor point for some exceptionally strong jaw muscles</a>.</p><p>Strong, agile, comfortable on land and with the unparalleled ability to use tools and throw, Kong would be a brutal force in a fight.</p><p><br/></p>\n        <p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n        <img alt=\"Godzilla's upright posture is unique among lizards and dinosaurs.

Like Kong, Godzilla has the traits of a few different species.</p><p>Recent Godzilla movies show him decently mobile on land, but seemingly much more comfortable in the water despite his lack of overt aquatic features. Interestingly, Godzilla is depicted with gills on his neck – a trait that land vertebrates lost after <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/icb/icm055\">they emerged from the sea about 370 million years ago</a>. Given Godzilla's terrestrial features, it's likely that his species has land-dwelling reptile ancestors and reevolved a mostly aquatic lifestyle – kind of like <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1098/rsbl.2005.0406\">sea turtles</a> or sea snakes, which can actually <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/0300-9629(75)90387-4\">absorb oxygen through their skin</a> in water. Godzilla may have uniquely reevolved gills.</p><p>Godzilla's tail is what really separates him from Kong. It is massive, and anchored and moved by <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/ar.21290\">huge muscles attached to his legs, hips and lower back</a>. Dinosaurs like <em>Tyrannosaurus rex</em> stood horizontally and used their tails for balance and to help them walk and run. Godzilla, in contrast, stands vertically and keeps his tail low to the ground, probably for a different type of balance. This vertical posture is unique for a two-legged reptile and more <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1098/rsbl.2014.0381\">resembles a standing kangaroo</a>. Godzilla stands on two muscular, pillarlike legs similar to those of a sauropod dinosaur. These would provide stability and help support his gargantuan mass but would also bolster the strength of his tail.</p><p>In addition to his powerful tail, Godzilla carries three rows of sharp spikes going down his back, thick scaly skin, a relatively small head full of carnivorous teeth and free arms with grasping hands, all built onto a muscular body. Taken together, Godzilla is a terrifying and intimidating adversary.</p><p><br/></p>\n        <p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n        <img class=\"rm-lazyloadable-image rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"0ff6064d58a66b2ef4456fe61af8c8bf\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" data-runner-src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjAzODQ4MC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYxODQzOTQ1N30.cO7kEO9SJ3rrahKmQ22lmyqnCyNUv5WINKzBhtdieAM/img.jpg?width=980\" height=\"1600\" id=\"585d0\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" width=\"1118\"/>\n        \n        \n        <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Credit...\">Tim Simpson/Flickr, CC BY-NC</small></p><div style=\"display: none;\"><img alt=\"Kong is faster and could use tools, but Godzilla is stronger and has armored skin. \" class=\"rm-lazyloadable-image rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"5df8e29f86a5dfd40012d79c4c8d8948\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" data-runner-src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjAzODQ4MC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYxODQzOTQ1N30.cO7kEO9SJ3rrahKmQ22lmyqnCyNUv5WINKzBhtdieAM/img.jpg?width=980\" height=\"1600\" id=\"585d0\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" width=\"1118\"/></div>\n        <p><br/></p><h2>Ready, fight!</h2><p>So now that we've looked a little closer at how Godzilla and Kong are built, let's imagine who might emerge victorious in battle.</p><p>Though Kong is a little bit smaller than Godzilla, both are more or less comparably massive in size and neither has a clear advantage here. So what about their fighting abilities? </p><p>Godzilla would likely favor his robust tail for both offense and defense – much like modern-day large lizards that <a href=\"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2017.2299\">use their strong tails as whips</a>. Scale up that strength to Godzilla's size, and that tail becomes a lethal weapon – which he <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO_utO644sk&ab_channel=Gigan2004\">has used before</a>.</p><p>However, Kong is more comfortable on land, faster and more agile, can use his strong legs to jump, and possesses much stronger arms than Godzilla – Kong probably packs a walloping punch. And as an ape, Kong would also <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.0030380\">likely use tools to some degree</a> and might even capitalize on his throwing ability.</p><p>Both would have a gnarly bite, with Kong likely getting a slight advantage. However, Godzilla's bite is by no means weak, and all of his teeth are flesh-piercing, similar to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmbbm.2019.05.025\">crocodile</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1666/0094-8373-35.4.525\">monitor lizard</a> teeth.</p><p>On defense, Godzilla has the edge, with thick scaly skin and sharp spikes. He might even act like a porcupine, turning his back to a rapidly approaching threat. However, Kong's superior agility on land should be able to offer him some protection as well.</p><p>I will admit I am #TeamGodzilla, but it's very close. I may give a slight edge to Kong in broad terrestrial battle ability, but Godzilla's general mass, defense and tail would be hard to overpower. And lest we forget, the tipping point for Godzilla is that he has atomic breath! Until researchers find evidence of a dinosaur or animal with something like that, though, I will have to reserve my scientific judgment. </p><p>Regardless of who emerges victorious, this battle will be one for the ages, and I am excited as both a scientist and monster movie fan.</p><p><em>This article has been updated to use more inclusive language</em><img alt=\"The Conversation\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/157101/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic\" width=\"1\"/>.</p><p><a href=\"https://theconversation.com/profiles/kiersten-formoso-1218031\">Kiersten Formoso</a>, PhD Student in Vertebrate Paleontology, <em><a href=\"https://theconversation.com/institutions/usc-dornsife-college-of-letters-arts-and-sciences-2669\">USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences</a></em></p><p>This article is republished from <a href=\"https://theconversation.com\">The Conversation</a> under a Creative Commons license.

It's as much a cage as a luxury. </li><li>Being dependent on a thing gives it power over you. To need something or someone is, for better or worse, to limit yourself.</li></ul><hr/><p><span></span>Philippa has decided she wants to quit social media. She's worried about how addictive it is and thinks it's not doing her any good at all. But then, how will she speak to her aunt in South Africa? What will happen to all of her photos? And how can she organize that party?</p><p>Trevor wants to leave the country. He distrusts the government, dislikes the people, and hates the weather. But, then, he does get good healthcare. And he does like the TV. The roads are pretty good, too.</p><p>Philippa and Trevor are two examples of how luxury, technology, and easy-living can ensnare us or box us in. In many ways, it's a modern and relatable phenomenon, but it goes back at least to the Roman writer, Tacitus. It's the idea that the trappings of civilization <em>enslave</em> us. How is it that, without even knowing it, those things we thought were helpful and time-saving became indispensable essentials?</p><h2>The hidden danger of luxury</h2><p>The Roman army was one of the most militarily effective and successful forces the world has ever known. On open land, their legions were pretty much unbeatable. But the Roman Empire was not built on the back of military genius and short, stabbing swords alone. The legions might have beaten a people, but they did not <em>subdue</em> them. It was the love of luxury and easy living that did that.</p><p>The Britons, Tacitus noted, were enslaved, not by chains, but by their desire for good wine and elegant dinner parties. In fact, the governor of Britain, Agricola, deliberately sought to pacify this tribal warrior society by the \"delightful distractions\" of warm baths, togas, and education. As Tacitus wrote, \"The naïve Britons described these things as 'civilization,' when in fact they were simply part of their enslavement.\" </p><p>Comfort and convenience had morphed painted, screaming warriors into genteel, pacified civilians. (It should be noted that Tacitus likely over-exaggerated all this. Britain was never as compliant as France or Spain in the Roman Empire.)</p><p>The use of luxury to win over a people is a tactic mirrored across time.</p><p>Faced with a trade deficit with China, the British Empire flooded their country with cheap opium they had shipped over from India. A luxury drug became an addiction, and the British traded their opium for porcelain, tea, and silk.</p><p><br/></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n        <img class=\"rm-lazyloadable-image rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"85f6eb129aac54d724a9ccc5105511f2\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" data-runner-src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjAzMzA4Ny9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY1NzMxODIxOX0.8JIhCYqzawWtkh2AKPqjqcqoG7m006X-ZmmhV7xGY7k/img.jpg?width=980\" height=\"652\" id=\"ff6fa\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" width=\"850\"/>\n        \n        \n        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Caption...\">Mikhail Gorbachev enjoying the American way of life.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Credit...\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Gorbachev#/media/File:Reagan_and_Gorbachev_in_western_hats_1992.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">Credit</a>: Bob Galbraith / Public domain via Wikipedia</small></p><p><br/></p><p>The Cold War was also won on the back of luxury. When cheap American TVs and refrigerators inevitably worked their way into the USSR, the Soviets couldn't hope to match such opulence. The bloc came to see such \"luxury\" domestic goods as essential, and only the USA could give them.</p><p>But the most relatable example for most of us today is our relationship with Big Tech. Companies like Facebook, Apple, and Google slowly and surely wire our lives into their algorithms and platforms. Social media are designed and calibrated to be deliberately addictive. Time- or money-saving services, like cloud-based storage, have become so universal, that going back is becoming impossible. It's increasingly the case that we don't even know our passwords for things—we let our phones or apps invent and store them for us.</p><h2>You can't leave the machine</h2><p>A new technology or service is initially a luxury—until it becomes so normalized and ubiquitous, so essential—that we can't go back to the time before it appeared. What was once a \"want\" becomes a \"need.\"</p><p>E.M. Forster's novella, \"The Machine Stops\", imagines a world where every facet of life is provided by \"the machine.\" There are buttons \"to call for food, music, clothing, hot baths, literature and, of course, communication with friends.\" How prescient has this turned out to be? Today, we have Uber, Skype, Hello Fresh, and Amazon Prime. Our friends and family are also plugged into the machine. </p><p>Is it possible to leave?</p><ul class=\"ee-ul\"></ul><p>Though we view technology as liberating, it also boxes us in. If we believe Tacitus, we are now enslaved by the things we once saw as luxury. It's the job of philosophy to see these chains for what they are.

If regret helped, would not most sinners eventually become saints? What do you regret the most often? Has it changed your behavior?\"</p><p>The researchers suggest that, as they suspected at the outset of the project, regret is an emotion that's adaptive, with its impact on behavior dependent on context. In the case of sexual regret, there may be a disconnect between what we think we should want and what we really want.</p><p>It may also be that habit simply overpowers regret. <a href=\"https://bigthink.com/robby-berman/its-your-brains-fault-you-make-the-same-mistakes-over-and-over\" target=\"_self\">Previous studies</a> have found that habits create ever-stronger neural pathways — it's why people often repeat mistakes.

Such was one of the central questions of a new <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.586983/full\" target=\"_blank\">study</a> that explored the power of marketing on how \"premium\" aficionados consider coffee to be. </p><p>The researchers set out to explore whether the origins of the coffee can affect the perception of its quality in the minds of the drinkers. In particular, they focused on the concept of terroir, the special characteristics conferred upon the coffee by the specific terrain in which it was grown. </p><p>\"Terroir is more than a mere geographical link between product and land,\" write the authors. \"It relates to the idea that products are a unique expression of different environmental and sociocultural characteristics of a specific place.\" Thus, focusing a customer's attention on the environment in which the coffee was grown might make the product seem more authentic and of better quality.</p><p>Therefore, the researchers examined the effect of images on the coffee-drinking experience in three experiments. The study was carried out by the food scientist Francisco Barbosa Escobar from Aarhus University in Denmark and marketing experts Olivia Petit from the Kedge Business School in Marseille, France, and Carlos Velasco from the BI Norwegian Business School in Oslo, Norway. Incidentally, Norwegians are among the world's top coffee consumers, with an average Norwegian adult consuming around 4 cups of coffee a day, reports<a href=\"https://www.ssb.no/utenriksokonomi/artikler-og-publikasjoner/kaffeavhengige-nordmenn\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Statistics Norway</a>.</p><p>The first experiment involved 770 non-expert participants from the UK. They were shown online images and descriptions of four different specialty coffees, traded by a Norwegian coffee company. The researchers found that coffees with pictures of farms were rated higher in premiumness by the subjects than coffees with pictures of cities.</p><p>For the second and third experiments, the study used virtual reality environments of Times Square in New York City and a farm in Kenya as well as a control setting of a white room. The second experiment engaged 143 non-expert participants recruited via a behavioral studies platform at the BI Norwegian Business School in Oslo, Norway. The participants were asked to smell a sample of quality ground coffee from Kenya while at the same time traversing a virtual reality atmosphere. The subjects were then asked to rate the coffee. </p><p><br/></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n        <img class=\"rm-lazyloadable-image rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"0ee1c7ccc92b9b1ec616aebb7fa00ff7\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" data-runner-src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjAzOTYxMC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYyMzM1OTM3Mn0.Bo8fM6zWiMO6cz0q8sgWy94OKPq48Q18W3gKnvB3cd0/img.jpg?width=980\" height=\"1339\" id=\"ef190\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" width=\"660\"/>\n        \n        \n        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Caption...\"> Image (A) shows the instruments used in Experiment 2: Oculus GO virtual reality (VR) headset and sample coffee bag.

Conversely, subjects rated coffee as sweeter when inside the control VR atmosphere compared to the city VR atmosphere. Furthermore, coffee was considered more premium when subjects were in the farm VR atmosphere compared to the control, but there was no difference in premiumness score between farm and city.</p><p>For the third experiment, the research team involved 34 people who were professionals in the coffee industry. They were asked to taste and score Kenyan coffee while being in the same city and farm VR environments used in the previous experiment. The results revealed a strong effect of atmosphere on how much the experts enjoyed their experience, with a much greater preference for the farm setting versus the control environment of a white room. </p><p>But the different VR atmospheres had little effect on how the experts rated the premiumness of the coffee. The researchers believe that \"given their specialized knowledge, coffee professionals examined more objective attributes of the coffee and could discriminate intrinsic factors relevant for the assessment of the coffee from irrelevant extrinsic cues.\"</p><p>The researchers think their results can lead to developing more immersive marketing experiences in virtual reality, which could be groundbreaking in many industries. A premium experience can lead to customers paying premium prices.</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/5CTiT4dYlFA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Sun, 11 Apr 2021 16:10:18 +0000","feedId":32,"bgimg":"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjAzOTYwNC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY0MjU0NDI0Nn0.eaPODLpkp4fo1lF8qjUCrxuo6qHopbS3ucwroY8QqRM/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=29%2C0%2C29%2C0&height=700","linkMd5":"c28f18a664fe6548aa94755ffbe2153a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn15@2020_1/2021/04/12/16-43-40-360_0262fa1f22bde9b0.webp","destWidth":1245,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":52648,"destBytes":52648,"author":"Paul Ratner","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjAzOTYwNC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY0MjU0NDI0Nn0.eaPODLpkp4fo1lF8qjUCrxuo6qHopbS3ucwroY8QqRM/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=29%2C0%2C29%2C0&height=700":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn15@2020_1/2021/04/12/16-43-40-360_0262fa1f22bde9b0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/5CTiT4dYlFA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn91@2020_4/2021/04/12/16-44-17-854_55ffeeeecedb4b8c.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618245819896},{"createdTime":"2021-04-13 00:43:39","updatedTime":"2021-04-13 00:43:39","title":"Is empathy always good?","link":"https://bigthink.com/videos/is-empathy-always-good","description":"<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"100%\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.rebelmouse.com/res/scraper/embed/?jwplayer_video_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcontent.jwplatform.com%2Fplayers%2FIaorbVVB-FvQKszTI.js\" width=\"100%\"></iframe><br/><ul class=\"ee-ul\"><li>Empathy is a useful tool that allows humans (and other species) to connect and form mutually beneficial bonds, but knowing how and when to be empathic is just as important as having empathy.</li><li>Filmmaker Danfung Dennis, Bill Nye, and actor Alan Alda discuss the science of empathy and the ways that the ability can be cultivated and practiced to affect meaningful change, both on a personal and community level.</li><li>But empathy is not a cure all.

To the researchers, they indicate an extended period of ozone depletion in the Earth's atmosphere. (While terrestrial plants and insects weren't as decimated as sea organisms during the extinction, they were nonetheless subjected to whatever it was that happened.)</p><p>Fields says there's scant evidence of a local culprit such as volcanic activity. His team also ruled out dramatic events such as meteorites, solar storms, or gamma-ray bursts. As grad student co-author Jesse Miller explains, \"These events end quickly and are unlikely to cause the long-lasting ozone depletion that happened at the end of the Devonian period.\"</p><p>\"Instead,\" says Fields, \"we propose that one or more supernova explosions, about 65 light-years away from Earth, could have been responsible for the protracted loss of ozone.\"</p><p>Such a flash of light would be both spectacular to witness and deadly. The researchers say that a supernova would be capable of damaging the ozone layer for as long as 100,000 years. Such an event would constitute a \"one-two punch.\" It would begin with a barrage of destructive ultraviolet rays, X-rays, and gamma rays. This would be followed by a longer-term increase in cosmic rays striking the Earth as a result of blast debris colliding with surrounding gases and driving increased particle acceleration.</p><p>Considering that there was apparently a 300,000-year decline in biodiversity before the massive die-off, the team suggests that the Earth may even have been affected by a series of supernova explosions instead of just one.</p><p>\"This is entirely possible,\" says Miller. \"Massive stars usually occur in clusters with other massive stars, and other supernovae are likely to occur soon after the first explosion.\"</p><h2>A \"smoking gun\" for the supernova hypothesis</h2><p>The only way to verify the theory put forth by Fields' team would be to find a particular pair of radioactive isotopes—plutonium-244 and samarium-146—in the geologic record for the time frame in question.</p><p>Undergraduate co-author Zhenghai Liu explains, \"Neither of these isotopes occurs naturally on Earth today, and the only way they can get here is via cosmic explosions.\"</p><p>Fields compares locating such isotopes to finding green bananas: \"When you see green bananas in Illinois, you know they are fresh, and you know they did not grow here. Like bananas, Pu-244 and Sm-146 decay over time. So if we find these radioisotopes on Earth today, we know they are fresh and not from here—the green bananas of the isotope world—and thus the smoking guns of a nearby supernova.\"</p><p>The search for the isotopes has yet to begin.</p>Meanwhile, there's little reason to worry about future supernovae doing to us what those earlier ones may have done to the Earth's coral reefs, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3uE49MV\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">science fiction</a> notwithstanding. Says another co-author, grad student Adrienne Ertel, \"To put this into perspective, one of the closest supernova threats today is from the star Betelgeuse, which is over 600 light-years away.\"<img
