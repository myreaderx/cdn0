Universal&#8217;s long-awaited feature film adaptation of the hit musical just lost another director with <strong>Stephen Daldry</strong> (<em>Extremely Loud &#38; Incredibly Close</em>), who has exited the project after being attached to the film for a year.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-642156\"></span></p>\n<p>Deadline reports that Stephen Daldry has exited Universal&#8217;s <em>Wicked</em>, more than a year after the <em>Billy Elliot </em>director <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wicked-release-date-december-2021/\">was announced</a> to be helming the film. The outlet reports that Daldry parted ways amicably with the production after the studio moved more quickly than the filmmaker was comfortable with. And with the pandemic limiting the stage space in London, which was an important element to Daldry, it would have made shooting difficult.</p>\n<p>Universal&#8217;s screen adaptation of Holzman and Schwartz&#8217;s Tony Award-winning musical has been long in the making, with chatter about the film first emerging in 2010, and everyone from JJ Abrams, James Mangold, Ryan Murphy, and Rob Marshall among the filmmakers in talks to direct.</p>\n<p>Universal is currently back on the search for directors, with hopes to begin production late next year — though it likely won&#8217;t meet the <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wicked-release-date-december-2021/\">December 2021 date</a> the studio set last year. Songwriter Stephen Schwartz and book writer Winnie Holzman teamed on the script and Marc Platt, who produces the stage musical with David Stone, is lead producer on the film. Deadline suggests that Spielberg could be the next choice, after making his first foray into musicals with <em>West Side Story</em>, as the filmmaker is looking for a new directing vehicle. My only hope is that Universal keeps Tom Hooper from getting is paws on <em>Wicked</em>, especially after the commercial and critical bombing of his disastrous adaptation of <em>Cats</em>.</p>\n<p>The <em>Wizard of Oz</em> prequel is based on the Gregory Maguire novel<em> Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West</em>, and focuses on the early relationship between Glinda the Good and Elphaba, a green-skinned beauty before she ended up a flying hag on a broomstick. <em>Wicked</em> began as a movie development project with Platt and Universal, before they changed course and took it to the stage first. It was an immediate sensation, quickly recouping its $14 million capitalization in 2004 and becoming one of the biggest grossing tuners of all time, with the Broadway show and all the touring companies.</p>\n<p>But the renewed movie talks have been going on for a while, with Universal (somewhat overconfidently) setting <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wicked-movie-2019/\">a 2019 release date</a> all the way back in 2016. It will likely be even longer until we see the <em>Wicked</em> movie this way come.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wicked-director-stephen-daldry-exits/\">&#8216;Wicked&#8217;

Foxx and <strong>Datari Turner</strong> will serve as executive producers along with <strong>Peter Baxter</strong>.</p>\n<p>The film stars Foxx as a &#8220;hard working blue collar dad who just wants to provide a good life for his quick-witted 8-year old daughter, but his mundane San Fernando Valley pool cleaning job is a front for his real source of income, hunting and killing vampires,&#8221; per the Netflix logline.</p>\n<p data-pw-in-article=\"true\">The script was written by <strong>Tyler Tice</strong>, winning the top prize at the Slamdance Writing Competition. Redicks discovered the screenplay and got Perry on board to direct, developing the project together before teaming up with Stahelski, 87Eleven Entertainment, and Netflix to further develop the script.</p>\n<p>Perry is a well-known second unit director and stunt coordinator whose credits include <em>Fast &#38; Furious 9</em>,<em> The Fate of the Furious</em>, <em>Bloodshot </em>and the <em>John Wick</em> franchise. <em>Day Shift</em> will be a reunion for Perry and his <em>John Wick </em>director Chad Stahelski, who also got his start as a stuntman and stunt coordinator before making the leap to director. <em>John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum</em> screenwriter Shay Hatten, who revised Tice&#8217;s script, also completes the <em>John Wick</em> trifecta.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I’ve known and worked with JJ for a long time,&#8221; Stahelski said in a statement. &#8220;His unique vision of Day Shift makes it such a great first directorial project for him.&#8221;</p>\n<p><em>Day Shift</em> sounds like a fun showcase for Foxx, who seems to have developed quite a partnership with Netflix — recently starring in the streaming giant&#8217;s <em>Project Power</em> and is set to co-star in and produce the upcoming film <em>They Cloned Tyrone</em> and series <em>Dad Stop Embarrassing Me</em>. I&#8217;m not sure if <em>Day Shift</em> is a family action flick, or a more hardcore thriller; the logline suggests that a working-man with a cute 8-year-old would appeal to families, but considering Perry&#8217;s pedigree in action franchises, it could likely be the latter.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/day-shift-jamie-foxx-netflix/\">&#8216;Day Shift&#8217;: Jamie Foxx Hunts Vampires in Netflix Movie From the &#8216;John Wick&#8217; Producers</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=07nlbBSU5AM:RvBnbSnrgtc:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=07nlbBSU5AM:RvBnbSnrgtc:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=07nlbBSU5AM:RvBnbSnrgtc:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=07nlbBSU5AM:RvBnbSnrgtc:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=07nlbBSU5AM:RvBnbSnrgtc:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=07nlbBSU5AM:RvBnbSnrgtc:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/07nlbBSU5AM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 20 Oct 2020 21:00:19 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/jamie-foxx-e1603216247958-700x345.jpg","linkMd5":"f07a0fc74dd4b4c0bd8d2298e0ec3567","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn24@2020_5/2020/10/21/01-30-10-294_4e8d0306829e25b9.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":345,"sourceBytes":30169,"destBytes":18786,"author":"Hoai-Tran Bui","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/jamie-foxx-e1603216247958-700x345.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn24@2020_5/2020/10/21/01-30-10-294_4e8d0306829e25b9.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn97@2020_5/2020/10/21/01-30-55-602_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=07nlbBSU5AM:RvBnbSnrgtc:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn5@2020_6/2020/10/21/01-30-55-761_53c1d0f19f634357.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn17@2020_2/2020/10/21/01-30-56-572_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=07nlbBSU5AM:RvBnbSnrgtc:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn46@2020_1/2020/10/21/01-30-56-337_fdf402e1e6cf23b1.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/07nlbBSU5AM":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn26@2020_3/2020/10/21/01-30-55-581_28d28b5a17e43719.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603243795476},{"createdTime":"2020-10-21 09:29:55","updatedTime":"2020-10-21 09:29:55","title":"‘Fast and Furious’ Franchise Confirmed to End with Two-Part Finale Directed by Justin Lin","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=642204","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-642205 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/fastandfurious-vindiesel-justinlin-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"Fast and Furious Franchise Ending\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/fastandfurious-vindiesel-justinlin.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/fastandfurious-vindiesel-justinlin-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Back in February this year, when we couldn&#8217;t even comprehend that our entire year was going to be ruined, <strong>Vin Diesel</strong> talked about the likelihood of ending the <strong><em>Fast and Furious</em></strong> franchise with <em><strong>Fast 10</strong></em>. However, rather than being one final movie, the franchise star and producer floated the idea of <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/vin-diesel-seems-to-want-fast-10-split-in-two/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">creating a two-part finale</a>, not unlike the end of franchises like <em>Harry Potter</em>, <em>The Hunger Games</em>, and <em>Twilight</em>. Now that plan has been confirmed by Universal Pictures, and <strong>Justin Lin</strong> will be at the helm of both of the final installments of the multi-billion dollar franchise.<span id=\"more-642204\"></span></p>\n<p>Deadline has news on the <em>Fast and Furious</em> franchise ending with two more movies following the upcoming<strong><em> F9</em></strong>, now slated for release over <span class=\"ILfuVd c3biWd\"><span class=\"hgKElc\">Memorial Day weekend on <strong>May 28, 2021</strong>. Does that mean this we&#8217;ll be getting <em><strong>Fast 10: Part I</strong></em> and<strong><em> Fast 10: Part 2</em></strong>, or will this be <em>Fast10 Your Seatbelts</em> and <em>The Last of the Furious </em>(<a href=\"https://twitter.com/BrianLynch/status/1318696236220780545\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">hat tip to Brian Lynch</a> for that stroke of genius) with a narrative connection like<em> Avengers: Infinity War</em> and <em>Avengers: Endgame</em>? That remains to be seen, but Vin Diesel and Universal clearly want to send off this franchise with a bang, and keeping Justin Lin in the director&#8217;s chair is the best way to do that.</span></span></p>\n<p>As of now, Vin Diesel will be joined by <strong>Michelle Rodriguez</strong>, <strong>Tyrese Gibson</strong>, <strong>Chris “Ludacris” Bridges</strong>, <strong>Jordana Brewster</strong>, <strong>Nathalie Emmanuel</strong>, and <strong>Sung Kang</strong>, who is making his big return to the franchise in <em>F9</em> after his character Han was believed to be dead. It&#8217;s not clear if <strong>Charlize Theron</strong>,<strong> John Cena</strong>, <strong>Helen Mirren</strong> or <strong>Cardi B</strong> will join them after the events of <em>F9</em>, but that&#8217;s likely because that would require venturing into more spoiler territory. Though I guess it&#8217;s a bit of a spoiler to know that the primary cast members aren&#8217;t in any danger of dying in the ninth installment.</p>\n<p>But what about <strong>Dwayne Johnson</strong> and <strong>Jason Statham</strong>? They&#8217;ve each been a key part of the franchise in their own way. In fact, Johnson has been credited with help reinvigorating the franchise. But Johnson famously had some beef with Vin Diesel behind the scenes, and while that&#8217;s believed to be squashed as best it can, the production of the <em>Fast and Furious</em> spin-off <em>Hobbs &#38; Shaw</em> didn&#8217;t rub Diesel the right way, and it&#8217;s not clear if those characters will return for the finale. Universal would be stupid to leave out those two big names, so I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;ll figure something out there. There are also rumblings of <strong>Gal Gadot</strong> potentially coming back to the franchise, which would make this quite the blockbuster finale.</p>\n<p>Back when Diesel talked about the possibility of ending the franchise with a two-part finale, he also hoped &#8220;this world to continue for generations to come.&#8221; So while a two-part finale could end the primary franchise, that doesn&#8217;t mean we couldn&#8217;t get more spin-offs or new stories with new characters set in the same world. But we&#8217;ve got a long time before we have to worry about that since there&#8217;s no indication as to when production on these two movies could begin. Stay tuned.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/fast-and-furious-franchise-ending-with-two-part-finale/\">&#8216;Fast and Furious&#8217; Franchise Confirmed to End with Two-Part Finale Directed by Justin Lin</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=Ydf03_mrzIg:ncB6Km4es-o:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=Ydf03_mrzIg:ncB6Km4es-o:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=Ydf03_mrzIg:ncB6Km4es-o:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=Ydf03_mrzIg:ncB6Km4es-o:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=Ydf03_mrzIg:ncB6Km4es-o:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=Ydf03_mrzIg:ncB6Km4es-o:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/Ydf03_mrzIg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 21 Oct 2020 00:54:49 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/fastandfurious-vindiesel-justinlin-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"50a747fb0e0774432f2348680830a524","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn48@2020_4/2020/10/21/01-29-55-757_c77b7340ac4ea503.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":33750,"destBytes":22078,"author":"Ethan Anderton","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/fastandfurious-vindiesel-justinlin-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn48@2020_4/2020/10/21/01-29-55-757_c77b7340ac4ea503.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn97@2020_5/2020/10/21/01-30-55-602_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=Ydf03_mrzIg:ncB6Km4es-o:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn87@2020_6/2020/10/21/01-30-55-572_e932c5754bc630dd.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn17@2020_2/2020/10/21/01-30-56-572_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=Ydf03_mrzIg:ncB6Km4es-o:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn81@2020_4/2020/10/21/01-30-56-671_e6e1467a6394ff80.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/Ydf03_mrzIg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn57@2020_4/2020/10/21/01-30-55-498_fb9a0d3cb3ec0390.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603243795480},{"createdTime":"2020-10-21 09:29:55","updatedTime":"2020-10-21 09:29:55","title":"Universal Studios Beijing Unveils New Concept Art and Details About Each of Its Seven Themed Lands","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=642115","description":"<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-642138 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Aviary-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"Universal Beijing Resort concept art\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Aviary.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Aviary-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>A year ago, we wrote about the <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/universal-studios-beijing-reveals-seven-themed-lands-harry-potter-transformers-jurassic-world-more/\">seven themed lands</a> being planned for China&#8217;s Universal Beijing Resort, which is set to open sometime next year.

There&#8217;s a new look at Jurassic World Adventure, the dark ride which uses the <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/universals-jurassic-world-ride/\">same ride system</a> as the Spider-Man attraction at Islands of Adventure and features a &#8220;nearly full-scale Indominus Rex&#8221; popping out during the climactic moments of the ride.

Will the pterosaurs that are supposedly flying overhead be digital projections, or physical objects hanging from a track?</p>\n<p>Also, I believe this is our first look at the Kung Fu Panda attraction, so perhaps people who find themselves in the middle of a Venn diagram featuring theme park obsessives and DreamWorks Animation stans will be pleased to see Po and his pals stepping into the theme park realm.</p>\n<p>In any case, you can get more information about most of the lands (via <a href=\"https://www.travelpulse.com/news/entertainment/universal-beijing-resort-unveils-new-theme-park-details.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Travelpulse</a>) below – minus Hollywood and Waterworld, which frankly sound pretty boring with the exception of that Steven Spielberg cameo:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In Transformers Metrobase, the first entire Transformers land in the world exclusively built in Universal Beijing Resort, guests can choose to become “guest agents” and fight together with Autobots on thrilling rides like the Decepticoaster, the biggest and most exciting roller coaster in the Resort or the Transformers: Battle for the AllSpark, one of the most popular rides in the land or visit the Energon Power Station to &#8220;replenish energy&#8221; like a bot.</li>\n<li>Guests can explore The Valley of Peace of Kung Fu Panda Land of Awesomeness, inspired by DreamWorks Animation’s beloved film franchise. Set in “Legendary China”, this is Universal’s first Kung Fu Panda-themed land. The Valley of Peace is the small town where Po, the panda hero of this story, lives. Guests can go on a Kung Fu adventure with Po, fighting against Tian Sha on a unique flume ride, Kung Fu Panda Journey of the Dragon Warrior.</li>\n<li>Inspired by Illumination’s Despicable Me franchise, Minion Land elates and captivates guests, welcoming them into a spectacular, one-of-a-kind immersive experience that invites them to explore iconic locations from the blockbuster films like never before. Throughout the land, guests can interact with the mischievous Minions themselves and, in the land’s signature attraction, Despicable Me Minion Mayhem, guests join Gru, his daughters and the Minions for an unpredictable and utterly electrifying ride. Guests are transformed into Minions and are launched into an unforgettable trip through Gru’s Super Villain laboratory.</li>\n<li>Walking into The Wizarding World of Harry Potter, Hogwarts castle perfectly embodies this incredible world full of infinite possibilities. Discover Dumbledore&#8217;s Office, Defense Against the Dark Arts Classroom, Gryffindor Common Room, and the Room of Requirement. The beloved Butterbeer is also available for guests to enjoy. In addition, guests may experience an adventure like no other with Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey.

Guests can explore this hidden world with four unique zones filled with interactive adventures.

Sure, it&#8217;s a bit vague – where&#8217;s the dragon? – but it has just the right amount of style to display the beauty of the digital animation that we&#8217;re bound to see in every frame. And tomorrow we&#8217;ll have even more to go off of because a <em>Raya and the Last Dragon</em> trailer is dropping on GMA (it&#8217;ll be online, too, just in case you don&#8217;t feel like sitting through GMA).</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the film&#8217;s synopsis:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Long ago, in the fantasy world of Kumandra, humans and dragons lived together in harmony. But when sinister monsters known as the Druun threatened the land, the dragons sacrificed themselves to save humanity. Now, 500 years later, those same monsters have returned and it’s up to a lone warrior, Raya, to track down the last dragon in order to finally stop the Druun for good. However, along her journey, she’ll learn that it’ll take more than dragon magic to save the world—it’s going to take trust as well.</p></blockquote>\n<p><em>Raya and the Last Dragon</em> comes from directors Don Hall and Carlos López Estrada, co-directors Paul Briggs and John Ripa, producers Osnat Shurer and Peter Del Vecho. The cast includes Kelly Marie Tran as Raya and Awkwafina as Sisu (the dragon). <em>Raya and the Last Dragon</em> opens in U.S. theaters on <strong>March 12, 2021</strong> – assuming theaters are still around then, that is.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/raya-and-the-last-dragon-poster/\">&#8216;Raya and the Last Dragon&#8217; Poster Arrives Ahead of Tomorrow&#8217;s Trailer</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=Hy2EOM7WtuU:BayxuKJ1JsM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=Hy2EOM7WtuU:BayxuKJ1JsM:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=Hy2EOM7WtuU:BayxuKJ1JsM:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=Hy2EOM7WtuU:BayxuKJ1JsM:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=Hy2EOM7WtuU:BayxuKJ1JsM:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=Hy2EOM7WtuU:BayxuKJ1JsM:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/Hy2EOM7WtuU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 20 Oct 2020 23:30:24 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/raya-and-the-last-dragon-poster-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"0ba356dd28103db1f115765e0cf2d2f7","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn71@2020_5/2020/10/21/01-30-06-211_f22207f0c4d0760f.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":37946,"destBytes":25506,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/raya-and-the-last-dragon-poster-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn71@2020_5/2020/10/21/01-30-06-211_f22207f0c4d0760f.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Ekx-8m8UcAAUXhv-700x1037.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn75@2020_3/2020/10/21/01-30-55-562_94c401d889ed7d3e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn97@2020_5/2020/10/21/01-30-55-602_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=Hy2EOM7WtuU:BayxuKJ1JsM:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn85@2020_1/2020/10/21/01-30-55-650_f5451fe58604e5bf.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn17@2020_2/2020/10/21/01-30-56-572_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=Hy2EOM7WtuU:BayxuKJ1JsM:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn13@2020_3/2020/10/21/01-30-55-775_d93fbbac49e5bee8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/Hy2EOM7WtuU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn82@2020_5/2020/10/21/01-30-55-612_adfc4b32330a527b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603243795480},{"createdTime":"2020-10-21 09:29:55","updatedTime":"2020-10-21 09:29:55","title":"California Announces Strict Guidelines for Disneyland, Universal and More Theme Parks to Reopen","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=639390","description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Disneyland-reopening.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-621266\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Disneyland-reopening-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"Disneyland reopening\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Disneyland-reopening.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Disneyland-reopening-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p>California has issued guidelines that will allow Disneyland, Universal Studios Hollywood, and other theme parks in the Golden State to reopen in the age of coronavirus. As has been the case, it all has to do with California&#8217;s tier system. The announcement today included instructions for how to reopen smaller theme parks and them parks in general tied into the color-coded system. <span id=\"more-639390\"></span></p>\n<p>Disneyland, along with Disney California Adventure, closed on March 14, 2020 due to the coronavirus. Downtown Disney reopened on July 9, 2020, and at one pint, the plan was to reopen the parks on Disneyland&#8217;s 65th anniversary on July 17, 2020, back when everyone was assuming and hoping that the virus would be under control by the summer. As we all know now, that didn&#8217;t happen, and the park&#8217;s opening was postponed. Since then, Disneyland has been waiting for guidelines from the state on how to reopen. Today, new guidelines were announced by Health and Human Services Secretary Dr. Mark Ghaly. But first, here&#8217;s a quick breakdown of California&#8217;s tier <a href=\"https://edsource.org/2020/quick-guide-what-californias-color-coded-county-tracking-system-means-for-schools/639357\">system</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Purple, or Tier 1, indicates that the virus is widespread in the county — with more than seven cases per 100,000 residents or more than 8% of tests results reported positive over seven days. Red (Tier 2) indicates “substantial” spread of the virus, while orange (Tier 3) indicates “moderate” spread and yellow (Tier 4) indicates “minimal” spread of the virus in the county.</p>\n<p>If one of the two metrics is higher than the other, the state will assign the county to the color associated with the highest rating. For example, if a county reports six cases per 100,000, but a 9% positivity rate, it will be rated purple.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Now, onto the new restrictions there were announced today:</p>\n<p><strong>Smaller theme parks may resume operations in Tier 3 (Orange)</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Limited capacity of 25 percent or 500 which is fewer.</li>\n<li>May only open outdoor attractions.</li>\n<li>Ticket sales limited to visitors in same county.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>All theme parks may resume operations in Tier 4 (Yellow)</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Limited capacity of 25 percent.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>All theme parks</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Implement a reservation system and screen guests for symptoms in advance.</li>\n<li>Face coverings mandatory throughout the park unless eating or drinking.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Professional sporting events and outdoor stadiums</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>May resume in Tier 3 at 20% and in Tier 4 at 25%.</li>\n<li>Ticket sales restricted to customers within 120 miles radius.</li>\n<li>Advance ticket sales and assigned seats (no day of or will-call ticket sales).</li>\n<li>Eating and drinking in assigned seats only.</li>\n<li>Face coverings are mandatory throughout the stadium unless eating or drinking</li>\n<li>Tailgating prohibited however parking at the stadium is required.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In other words, big parks like Disneyland and Universal can&#8217;t reopen until they get to Tier 4 – which seems like it&#8217;s all but impossible at this point. Smaller parks will have better luck here, but for now, it looks like Disneyland and Univeral won&#8217;t be reopening anytime soon.</p>\n<p>This news comes on the heels of the announcement that The Walt Disney Company would be issuing a new wave of layoffs affecting approximately 28,000 cast members in the Parks, Experiences, and Products sectors of the company. The layoffs are unquestionably difficult news, but as Bradley Pollock, chairman of the Department of Public Health Sciences at UC Davis, told <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-10-01/disney-layoffs-pressure-newsom-coronavirus-restrictions\">The Los Angeles Times</a>, California Governor Gavin Newsom and his staff are &#8220;confronting an extremely difficult calculus in determining the size and pace of reopenings.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;The virus hasn’t changed,&#8221; Pollock added. &#8220;When you have people who can gather physically closer together, you increase the risk. Is it worth it?&#8221; The new theme park reopening plans were issued by the California Department of Public Health.</p>\n<p>Following today&#8217;s announcement, Disney released this statement.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"und\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://t.co/7puslis82y\">pic.twitter.com/7puslis82y</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Disney Parks News (@DisneyParksNews) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DisneyParksNews/status/1318644525565321217?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 20, 2020</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/disneyland-reopening-guidelines/\">California Announces Strict Guidelines for Disneyland, Universal and More Theme Parks to Reopen</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=XWv0UXsBMys:doXmtMnuf5s:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=XWv0UXsBMys:doXmtMnuf5s:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=XWv0UXsBMys:doXmtMnuf5s:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=XWv0UXsBMys:doXmtMnuf5s:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=XWv0UXsBMys:doXmtMnuf5s:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=XWv0UXsBMys:doXmtMnuf5s:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/XWv0UXsBMys\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 20 Oct 2020 20:00:41 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Disneyland-reopening-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"6d5b0a2d4b87f19a85b2a7d36d7f233f","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn43@2020_4/2020/10/21/01-30-06-329_fcaf34f336a2f589.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":56592,"destBytes":40992,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Disneyland-reopening-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn43@2020_4/2020/10/21/01-30-06-329_fcaf34f336a2f589.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn97@2020_5/2020/10/21/01-30-55-602_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=XWv0UXsBMys:doXmtMnuf5s:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn54@2020_6/2020/10/21/01-30-55-705_80cc26c90f8d43ef.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn17@2020_2/2020/10/21/01-30-56-572_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=XWv0UXsBMys:doXmtMnuf5s:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn34@2020_3/2020/10/21/01-30-55-686_22f816249670f74d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/XWv0UXsBMys":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn29@2020_4/2020/10/21/01-30-55-559_799527c3d653b297.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603243795485},{"createdTime":"2020-10-21 09:29:55","updatedTime":"2020-10-21 09:29:55","title":"Borat Drops By ‘Jimmy Kimmel Live’ with His Daughter and a ‘Borat 2’ Clip","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=642093","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-642103 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/borat-jimmykimmellive-inspection-700x302.jpg\" alt=\"Borat on Jimmy Kimmel Live\" width=\"700\" height=\"302\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/borat-jimmykimmellive-inspection-700x302.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/borat-jimmykimmellive-inspection-360x155.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/borat-jimmykimmellive-inspection-768x331.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/borat-jimmykimmellive-inspection.jpg 951w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>This week brings the debut of <strong><em>Borat: </em></strong><span class=\"style-scope yt-formatted-string\" dir=\"auto\"><strong><em>Subsequent Moviefilm: Delivery of Prodigious Bribe to American Regime for Make Benefit Once Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan</em></strong>, the sequel to the hit comedy mockumentary from 2005 starring <strong>Sacha Baron Cohen</strong>.

He also comes with a scientific report from <span class=\"style-scope yt-formatted-string\" dir=\"auto\">Kazakhstan that a new virus has spread from Israel, so Borat&#8217;s ignorant distrust of the Jewish people hasn&#8217;t gone away in the past decade and a half (Cohen himself is Jewish). He proceeds to conduct a special questionnaire to figure out whether Kimmel may have been exposed to the virus recently. There&#8217;s also a new symptom you may not have heard of involving discoloration on a certain part of the male anatomy.</span></p>\n<p>Then, after introducing a new clip from his latest movie (which you can watch below), Borat brings out his daughter Tutar. One thing leads to another, and both Borat and Jimmy Kimmel end up without pants, and we&#8217;ll just let you watch the clip to see how that happens.</p>\n<p>Aside from the late night antics, here&#8217;s the new <em>Borat 2</em> clip that debuted during the show:</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7yOWiBv3lBU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>In the clip, Borat, who is in disguise, takes his daughter to a bakery. She eats a plastic baby on top of a cupcake, so they go to a faith-based pregnancy crisis center to have the baby removed, which makes for an awkward conversation with the pastor on-hand. I&#8217;m very much looking forward to seeing how that interaction comes to an end when <em>Borat 2</em> arrives on Amazon Prime on <strong>October 23, 2020</strong>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/borat-on-jimmy-kimmel-live-2020/\">Borat Drops By &#8216;Jimmy Kimmel Live&#8217; with His Daughter and a &#8216;Borat 2&#8217; Clip</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=KzdG81I_7h4:pE9YyUuWcXU:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=KzdG81I_7h4:pE9YyUuWcXU:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=KzdG81I_7h4:pE9YyUuWcXU:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=KzdG81I_7h4:pE9YyUuWcXU:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=KzdG81I_7h4:pE9YyUuWcXU:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=KzdG81I_7h4:pE9YyUuWcXU:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/KzdG81I_7h4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 20 Oct 2020 17:30:57 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/borat-jimmykimmellive-inspection-700x302.jpg","linkMd5":"c194acfd5a6f55185f54015f55c5ff37","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn10@2020_5/2020/10/21/01-30-32-706_f8f715591ca84b64.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":302,"sourceBytes":26393,"destBytes":15242,"author":"Ethan Anderton","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/borat-jimmykimmellive-inspection-700x302.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn10@2020_5/2020/10/21/01-30-32-706_f8f715591ca84b64.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn97@2020_5/2020/10/21/01-30-55-602_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=KzdG81I_7h4:pE9YyUuWcXU:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn78@2020_2/2020/10/21/01-30-56-498_4f487f9c0c8cf7c1.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn17@2020_2/2020/10/21/01-30-56-572_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=KzdG81I_7h4:pE9YyUuWcXU:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn57@2020_1/2020/10/21/01-30-56-545_7c93946633aae525.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/KzdG81I_7h4":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn93@2020_2/2020/10/21/01-30-55-582_816c01f8a4643ab3.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603243795480},{"createdTime":"2020-10-21 09:29:55","updatedTime":"2020-10-21 09:29:55","title":"‘Away’ Canceled at Netflix After One Season, Star Hilary Swank Reacts","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=642180","description":"<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-630692 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/away-hilaryswank-spacesuit-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"Away canceled\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/away-hilaryswank-spacesuit-700x300.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/away-hilaryswank-spacesuit-360x154.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/away-hilaryswank-spacesuit-768x330.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/away-hilaryswank-spacesuit.jpg 902w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Netflix seems to be on a cancelation streak as of late, and the science fiction space drama <em><strong>Away</strong></em> is the streaming service&#8217;s latest victim.</p>\n<p>In the wake of cancelations handed down to Netflix shows like <em>Glow</em>, <em>I Am Not Okay with This</em>, <em>Teenage Bounty Hunters</em>, <em>The Society</em>, <em>Altered Carbon</em>, and <em>The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance</em>, <em>Away</em> has been canceled after one season. You can read star <strong>Hilary Swank</strong>&#8216;s response to the news below.<span id=\"more-642180\"></span></p>\n<p><em>Away</em> is going away. <a href=\"https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/netflix-cancels-away-1234810392/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Variety</a> reports that six weeks after the series made its debut on September 4, 2020, Netflix has decided to not renew it for a second season.

As the crew’s journey into space intensifies, their personal dynamics and the effects of being away from their loved ones back on Earth become increasingly complex. AWAY shows that sometimes to reach for the stars, we must leave home behind.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/away-canceled/\">&#8216;Away&#8217; Canceled at Netflix After One Season, Star Hilary Swank Reacts</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=N4DmNAc0aWQ:fPXdmU5L-Ew:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=N4DmNAc0aWQ:fPXdmU5L-Ew:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=N4DmNAc0aWQ:fPXdmU5L-Ew:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=N4DmNAc0aWQ:fPXdmU5L-Ew:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=N4DmNAc0aWQ:fPXdmU5L-Ew:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=N4DmNAc0aWQ:fPXdmU5L-Ew:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/N4DmNAc0aWQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 20 Oct 2020 22:00:16 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/away-hilaryswank-spacesuit-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"cfaabcdbd9eb36ed0ffb0c824f0ff29a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn7@2020_5/2020/10/21/01-30-13-931_617360db791e3e57.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":29795,"destBytes":18650,"author":"Ben Pearson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/away-hilaryswank-spacesuit-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn7@2020_5/2020/10/21/01-30-13-931_617360db791e3e57.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn97@2020_5/2020/10/21/01-30-55-602_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=N4DmNAc0aWQ:fPXdmU5L-Ew:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn54@2020_3/2020/10/21/01-30-56-365_9611586c70a33e09.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn17@2020_2/2020/10/21/01-30-56-572_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=N4DmNAc0aWQ:fPXdmU5L-Ew:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn7@2020_5/2020/10/21/01-30-55-768_54906e3ef6f3198d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/N4DmNAc0aWQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn73@2020_3/2020/10/21/01-30-55-630_5089283395ae70a6.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603243795464},{"createdTime":"2020-10-21 09:29:55","updatedTime":"2020-10-21 09:29:55","title":"Marvel Unlimited Making Digital Comics Available Much Sooner After Being Released on Shelves","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=642084","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-642089 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/marvelunlimited-banner-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"Marvel Unlimited New Comics Availability\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/marvelunlimited-banner.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/marvelunlimited-banner-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>While there are plenty of apps available out there that make it easy to download and read comic books on our computers, tablets and phones, the one downside to comic subscription services is that the digital versions of new comics aren&#8217;t available as soon as they&#8217;re released in comic shops and bookstores.

This expansion for Marvel Unlimited delivers exactly that: fans can now read more of their favorite comics sooner! No other service can provide this kind of value and access to so many Marvel comics in one place. We’re thrilled to now be able to offer even more to readers.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>As of now, there are over 28,000 comics available to read through Marvel Unlimited, ranging from the classic comics of the 1960s through ongoing story arcs in the latest Marvel Comics titles.

Bad news first: if you liked the 2017 <em>Power Rangers</em> movie and hoped for more adventures with that same cast, that ain&#8217;t happening. Good news: a new movie and TV show are in the works, as part of a new, cohesive <em>Power Rangers</em> connected story universe which will be overseen by a single creator. Get the details below.<span id=\"more-642152\"></span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/power-rangers-getting-film-and-tv-treatment-from-im-not-okay-with-this-co-creator-exclusive\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Hollywood Reporter</a> says that <strong>Jonathan Entwistle</strong>, who created Netflix&#8217;s <em>The End of the F***ing World</em> and co-created the streaming service&#8217;s unconventional teen superpower series <em>I Am Not Okay With This</em>, has been tasked with serving as &#8220;a conductor of a connected story universe that will bridge across multiple platforms.&#8221; Entwistle will oversee and direct both film and television adaptations, which seems to indicate that the previous big-screen iteration will stand alone as a one-and-done anomaly, a solid example of a 21st century franchise non-starter. THR reports that &#8220;name talent&#8221; will be involved in the new productions.</p>\n<p>Hasbro, which bought the Power Rangers brand <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/power-rangers-hasbro/\">in 2018</a>, acquired a production arm called eOne late last year, and that company is now becoming more involved in the development of Hasbro brands across multiple platforms. In December, word came out that Entwistle was hard at work on a new <em>Power Rangers</em> movie at Paramount, which featured &#8220;a time travel element that brings the kids to the 1990s, and in <em>Back to the Future</em> fashion, they have to find a way to get back to their present.&#8221; That project has now shifted over to eOne (in yet another example of Paramount offloading potentially valuable content), and the scope of Entwistle&#8217;s involvement is increasing to both film and television. There&#8217;s no word yet about whether the show will also travel back to the 1990s.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This is an unbelievable opportunity to deliver new <em>Power Rangers</em> to both new and existing generations of awaiting and adoring fans.

It initially spawned two theatrically-released films (1995&#8217;s <em>Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie</em> and 1997&#8217;s <em>Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie</em>) as well as more than 20 different incarnations of TV shows.

Chu</strong>, director of <em>Crazy Rich Asians</em> and <em>In the Heights</em>, is set to direct a <em>Willow</em> TV series for Disney+, with <em>Willow</em> star <strong>Warwick Davis</strong> returning as Willow Ufgood. <strong>Ron Howard</strong>, who directed the film, is also on board as executive producer. Released in 1988, the fantasy epic <em>Willow</em> came from a story by George Lucas, and while it was not the huge blockbuster Lucasfilm was hoping for, it turned a profit – and developed a strong following thanks to home video.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-642141\"></span></p>\n<p>Disney+ will return to the magical world of <em>Willow</em> with its new TV series, which marks Lucasfilm&#8217;s first venture into non-<em>Star Wars</em> storytelling since 2015. The series takes place years after the events of the original <em>Willow</em> film, and &#8220;introduces all-new characters to the enchanted realm of fairy queens and two-headed Eborsisk monsters, and welcomes back its namesake hero, Willow Ufgood, performed once again by the unmatchable Warwick Davis.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;So many fans have asked me over the years if Willow will make a return, and now I&#8217;m thrilled to tell them that he will indeed,&#8221; said Warwick Davis. &#8220;Many have told me they grew up with ‘Willow’ and that the film has influenced how they view heroism in our own world. If Willow Ufgood can represent the heroic potential in all of us, then he is a character I am extremely honored to reprise.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In the movie, Willow was a farmer who went on a dangerous journey to protect a baby from an evil queen. In addition to Davis, the cast included Val Kilmer, Joanne Whalley, Jean Marsh, and Billy Barty. Critics were not enchanted with what director Ron Howard had to offer, but the movie made enough money to not be considered a total flop – although Howard and Lucasfilm were definitely hoping for bigger returns. And while <em>Willow</em> didn&#8217;t do boffo box office, it built up a steady following via home video releases, to the point where Disney+ now feels confident moving forward with a TV series.</p>\n<p>Jon M. Chu will direct the pilot and serve as executive producer alongside <strong>Jonathan Kasdan</strong> and<strong> Wendy Mericle</strong>. Kasdan wrote the pilot. &#8220;Growing up in the &#8217;80s, <em>Willow</em> has had a profound effect on me,&#8221; said Chu. &#8220;The story of the bravest heroes in the least likely places allowed me, an Asian-American kid growing up in a Chinese restaurant looking to go to Hollywood, to believe in the power of our own will, determination and of course, inner magic. So the fact that I get to work with my heroes from Kathleen Kennedy to Ron Howard is bigger than a dream-come-true. It’s a bucket-list moment for me. Jon Kasdan and Wendy Mericle have added such groundbreaking new characters and delightful surprises to this timeless story that I can’t wait for the world to come along on this epic journey with us.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Ron Howard added: &#8220;It&#8217;s creatively exciting to not only revisit the world and characters first conceived by George Lucas, Bob Dolman and myself but to see it take flight in such fresh, fun and cinematic ways through the imagination of Jon Kasdan and Team Willow. This isn&#8217;t a nostalgic throw-back, it’s a creative lean-forward and it’s a blast to be a part of it all.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Lucasfilm president <strong>Kathleen Kennedy</strong> said: &#8220;This is an exciting new era for storytelling at Lucasfilm. Jon Chu&#8217;s vision, coupled with the writing of Jon Kasdan and Wendy Mericle, is going to take Willow into new and exciting directions for the series. Reuniting Ron Howard and Warwick Davis in the world of <em>Willow</em> is something that they&#8217;ve both wanted to do for some time, and I couldn’t be more proud of the incredible team we’ve put together to bring this series to Disney+.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Production on the series will begin next year in Wales, where much of the original film was shot.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/willow-tv-series/\">&#8216;Willow&#8217; TV Series From Disney+ Will Be Directed by &#8216;Crazy Rich Asians&#8217; Director Jon M.

Now we know what that project is: an HBO limited series called <em><strong>The Son</strong></em>, based on Norwegian author Jo Nesbø&#8217;s book of the same name. Get the details below.<span id=\"more-642140\"></span></p>\n<p>HBO has given a series order to <em>The Son</em>, a limited series that will star and be executive produced by Jake Gyllenhaal. Villeneuve is set to direct and executive produce, while writer <strong>Lenore Zion</strong> (<em>Billions</em>, <em>Channel Zero</em>, <em>Ray Donovan</em>) will showrun and executive produce. Nesbø is on board as an executive producer, while Kilter Films&#8217; <strong>Jonathan Nolan</strong> and <strong>Lisa Joy</strong>, who are behind HBO&#8217;s <em>Westworld</em>, will executive produce as well, adding to the overall pedigree of this limited series.</p>\n<p>The book is described as &#8220;a tale of vengeance set amid Oslo&#8217;s brutal hierarchy of corruption,&#8221; but that&#8217;s pretty vague. Here&#8217;s the synopsis from Amazon:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Sonny Lofthus is a strangely charismatic and complacent young man. Sonny&#8217;s been in prison for a dozen years, nearly half his life. The inmates who seek out his uncanny abilities to soothe leave his cell feeling absolved. They don&#8217;t know or care that Sonny has a serious heroin habit—or where or how he gets his uninterrupted supply of the drug. Or that he&#8217;s serving time for other peoples&#8217; crimes.</p>\n<p>Sonny took the first steps toward addiction when his father took his own life rather than face exposure as a corrupt cop. Now Sonny is the seemingly malleable center of a whole infrastructure of corruption: prison staff, police, lawyers, a desperate priest—all of them focused on keeping him high and in jail. And all of them under the thumb of the Twin, Oslo&#8217;s crime overlord. As long as Sonny gets his dope, he&#8217;s happy to play the criminal and the prison&#8217;s in-house savior.</p>\n<p>But when he learns a stunning, long-hidden secret concerning his father, he makes a brilliantly executed escape from prison—and from the person he&#8217;d let himself become—and begins hunting down those responsible for the crimes against him&#8230;The darkly looming question is: Who will get to him first—the criminals or the cops?</p></blockquote>\n<p>Jake Gyllenhaal starring in a prison break drama directed by Denis Villeneuve? Hell yes. I would like to see this immediately, please. Some people may be a bit hesitant, since the last high-profile adaptation of Nesbø&#8217;s work was the <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-snowman-director-says-15-of-the-script-wasnt-even-filmed/\">disastrous</a> film version of <em>The Snowman</em> (best known for the <a href=\"https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/i-gave-you-all-the-clues-hello-mister-police\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">memes based on its ridiculous poster</a>), but after that notorious whiff, things can only get better&#8230;right?</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-son-jake-gyllenhaal/\">&#8216;The Son&#8217;: Jake Gyllenhaal to Star in HBO Limited Series Directed by Denis Villeneuve</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=lqJHsbwP-Bk:e8qU8sz6Piw:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=lqJHsbwP-Bk:e8qU8sz6Piw:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=lqJHsbwP-Bk:e8qU8sz6Piw:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=lqJHsbwP-Bk:e8qU8sz6Piw:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=lqJHsbwP-Bk:e8qU8sz6Piw:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=lqJHsbwP-Bk:e8qU8sz6Piw:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/lqJHsbwP-Bk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 20 Oct 2020 19:00:51 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/The-Son-Jake-Gyllenhaal-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"1e3bf45b415d5662f20eafee97ff2433","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn52@2020_3/2020/10/21/01-30-14-471_ac7faa8c86b3f144.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":20722,"destBytes":10964,"author":"Ben Pearson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/The-Son-Jake-Gyllenhaal-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn52@2020_3/2020/10/21/01-30-14-471_ac7faa8c86b3f144.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn97@2020_5/2020/10/21/01-30-55-602_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=lqJHsbwP-Bk:e8qU8sz6Piw:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn83@2020_2/2020/10/21/01-30-55-692_ab0886020ec1c39a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn17@2020_2/2020/10/21/01-30-56-572_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=lqJHsbwP-Bk:e8qU8sz6Piw:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn69@2020_3/2020/10/21/01-30-56-452_4eeba55b93b1627f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/lqJHsbwP-Bk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn84@2020_4/2020/10/21/01-30-55-562_ec35566adce4c9fe.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603243795480},{"createdTime":"2020-10-21 09:29:55","updatedTime":"2020-10-21 09:29:55","title":"‘Euphoria’ Returning With Two New Episodes Before Season 2, Including a Christmas Special","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=642096","description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Euphoria-christmas-special.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-642108\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Euphoria-christmas-special-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"Euphoria christmas special\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Euphoria-christmas-special-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Euphoria-christmas-special-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Euphoria-christmas-special-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Euphoria-christmas-special.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p>HBO&#8217;s <strong><em>Euphoria</em></strong> will return with two new episodes ahead of its eventual second season.

Both will continue the story from season 1, and – in case you were wondering – both were produced under COVID-19 guidelines. More on the <em>Euphoria</em> Christmas special and the additional COVID episode below.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-642096\"></span></p>\n<p>I have yet to watch <em>Euphoria</em> even though I&#8217;ve heard great things. Why? Because it <em>really</em> looks like a show geared towards people half my age, and I already feel old and ancient enough without a TV show reminding me, thank you very much! But the series is a big hit, winning awards and pulling in a devoted fanbase. The series follows &#8220;17-year-old Rue Bennett (<strong>Zendaya</strong>), a drug addict fresh from rehab, who&#8217;s struggling to make sense of her future. Her life changes dramatically when she meets Jules Vaughn (<strong>Hunter Schafer</strong>), a trans girl who recently moved to town following her parents&#8217; divorce, and like Rue is searching for where she belongs.&#8221;</p>\n<p><em>Euphoria</em> is coming back for a second season, but before that happens, HBO will release two special episodes, with the first debuting on Sunday, <strong>December 6</strong>. The episode will air on HBO and be available to stream on HBO Max. Here&#8217;s what you can expect to see:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In the aftermath of being left by Jules at the train station and relapsing, the first special episode follows Rue (played by Emmy®-winner Zendaya) as she celebrates Christmas. Written and directed by series creator Sam Levinson, the episode, titled &#8220;Trouble Don&#8217;t Last Always,” also stars Colman Domingo, who appeared in season one. The title and date of the second episode are forthcoming.

That was originally supposed to be the theatrical release date, but as the fate of movie theaters continues to be in doubt, the film will now skip a theatrical release entirely in the U.S. Deadline adds that Sony and eOne &#8220;retain distribution rights in Canada and the rest of the world&#8221; and that &#8220;overseas plans, which could include theatrical releases, will be finalized later.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In <em>Happiest Season</em>, &#8220;Meeting your girlfriend’s family for the first time can be tough. Planning to propose at her family’s annual Christmas dinner &#8211; until you realize that they don’t even know she’s gay &#8211; is even harder. When Abby (Kristen Stewart) learns that Harper (Mackenzie Davis) has kept their relationship a secret from her family, she begins to question the girlfriend she thought she knew. <em>Happiest Season</em> is a holiday romantic comedy that hilariously captures the range of emotions tied to wanting your family’s acceptance, being true to yourself, and trying not to ruin Christmas.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In addition to Kristen Stewart and Mackenzie Davis, the film features <strong>Alison Brie</strong>, <strong>Aubrey Plaza</strong>,<strong> Dan Levy</strong>, <strong>Victor Garber</strong>, and <strong>Mary Steenburgen</strong>. Director Cea DuVall co-wrote the script with <strong>Mary Holland</strong>. I saw DuVall&#8217;s feature directorial debut <em>The Intervention</em>, and enjoyed it for the most part. And I&#8217;m definitely looking forward to <em>Happiest Season</em> for the cast alone, which is pretty damn great across the board.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s such a human story, and it&#8217;s humanity we&#8217;re all confronted with right now. Seeing empathy and compassion modeled [on screen], I&#8217;ve been enjoying it. We all need that kind of embrace,&#8221; DuVall told <a href=\"https://ew.com/movies/happiest-season-fall-movie-preview/\">EW</a> in a story published earlier this month.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This holiday season — more than any other — we could all use a little happiness. It was essential to Sony Pictures and to the filmmakers that Clea’s marvelous and fresh holiday-themed romantic comedy come out when the lights are on the trees,&#8221; said Nicole Brown, President of TriStar Pictures. &#8220;We are excited that Hulu is geared up to make this happen in the U.S. and grateful that they love the movie as much as we do.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/happiest-season-release/\">&#8216;Happiest Season&#8217; with Kristen Stewart and Mackenzie Davis Skipping Theaters and Going to Hulu</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=1o8S_g1Jz1U:v65B8WWUHww:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=1o8S_g1Jz1U:v65B8WWUHww:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=1o8S_g1Jz1U:v65B8WWUHww:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=1o8S_g1Jz1U:v65B8WWUHww:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=1o8S_g1Jz1U:v65B8WWUHww:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=1o8S_g1Jz1U:v65B8WWUHww:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/1o8S_g1Jz1U\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 20 Oct 2020 22:30:38 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/happiest-season-release-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"6ce93512952b5e79c04275265bb6acaa","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn40@2020_6/2020/10/21/01-30-18-734_21d35b7c94b5d991.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":26628,"destBytes":14760,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/happiest-season-release-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn40@2020_6/2020/10/21/01-30-18-734_21d35b7c94b5d991.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn97@2020_5/2020/10/21/01-30-55-602_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=1o8S_g1Jz1U:v65B8WWUHww:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn50@2020_6/2020/10/21/01-30-56-352_39c8b112ce5ca03c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn17@2020_2/2020/10/21/01-30-56-572_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=1o8S_g1Jz1U:v65B8WWUHww:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn85@2020_4/2020/10/21/01-30-56-500_2d7a54b08ba6db2c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/1o8S_g1Jz1U":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn99@2020_4/2020/10/21/01-30-55-561_3d0108e059b73db1.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603243795476},{"createdTime":"2020-10-21 09:29:55","updatedTime":"2020-10-21 09:29:55","title":"‘The Flight Attendant’ Trailer: Kaley Cuoco Gets Caught Up in a Murder Mystery","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=642099","description":"<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-642106\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-flight-attendant-700x320.jpg\" alt=\"the flight attendant trailer\" width=\"700\" height=\"320\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-flight-attendant-700x320.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-flight-attendant-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-flight-attendant-768x351.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-flight-attendant.jpg 1440w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Kaley Cuoco</strong> has been pegged as the hot comedy girl since <em>The Big Bang Theory</em> became a baffling success, but the actress has forged a solid partnership with HBO Max, with her acclaimed work on the beloved animated series <em>Harley Quinn</em> and now with a darkly comic thriller that is sure to test Cuoco&#8217;s dramatic chops:<strong> <em>The Flight Attendant</em></strong>. Cuoco stars in <em>The Flight Attendant</em> as a &#8220;crazy&#8221; and &#8220;drunk&#8221; flight attendant who is definitely not a murderer, despite the dead body that she wakes up next to after a hotel tryst with a passenger.

While the poster (which you can see below) and the premise suggest a Hitchcock-inspired thriller, there&#8217;s a comedic tone to <em>The Flight Attendant</em> which reminds me of <em>A Simple Favor</em> — a semi-satire of the murder mystery genre. Nevertheless, a dark comedic thriller sounds like a great showcase for Cuoco, who gives a great performance as a woman spiraling into paranoia and questioning her sanity in the trailer.</p>\n<p><i>The Flight Attendant</i> is an eight-episode limited series that also stars <strong>Rosie Perez</strong>, <strong>Zosia Mamet</strong>, <strong>Michelle Gomez</strong>, and <strong>T.R. Knight</strong>, and is executive produced by <em>You</em> co-creator <strong>Greg Berlanti</strong>. The first two episodes are directed by <em>Booksmart</em> writer <strong>Susanna Fogel</strong>. Kaley, Steve Yockey, Marcie Ulin, Meredith Lavender and Sarah Schechter also serve as executive producers, and Suzanne McCormack is co-executive Producer.</p>\n<p>Here is the official synopsis for <em>The Flight Attendant</em>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The Flight Attendant is a story of how an entire life can change in one night. A flight attendant (Cuoco) wakes up in the wrong hotel, in the wrong bed, with a dead man – and no idea what happened. The dark comedic thriller is based on the novel of the same name by New York Times best-selling author Chris Bohjalian.</p></blockquote>\n<p><em>The Flight Attendant </em>debuts on HBO Max on<strong> November 26, 2020</strong>, followed by two episodes on December 3, two episodes on December 10, and the finale on December 17.

Very little is known about this latest take on Leatherface and the fam – but we do know there have been some behind-the-scenes issues. <strong>Ryan </strong>and<strong> Andy Tohill</strong>, the duo behind the 2018 British-Irish film <em>The Dig</em>, were originally helming the project. However, after a week of footage, the duo walked off the project due to creative differences. Now, <strong>David Blue Garcia</strong> (<em>Tejano</em>) is directing, with a script by <strong>Chris Thomas Devlin</strong>. <em>Don&#8217;t Breathe</em> director Fede Álvarez is producing.</p>\n<p>The version the Tohills were making was reportedly about a woman who drags her teenage sister out to Texas on a business trip. However, all of the Tohill&#8217;s footage has been thrown out, so I&#8217;m not 100% sure how much of that is still accurate. If it is, you can rest assured that the sisters will find themselves running afoul of Leatherface and his cannibal redneck family, too.  <strong>Elsie Fisher</strong>, <strong>Sarah Yarkin</strong>,<strong> Jacob Latimore,</strong> and <strong>Moe Dunford</strong> star.</p>\n<p>Released in 1974, Tobe Hooper&#8217;s <em>The Texas Chain Saw Massacre</em> is a horror classic that still has the power to terrify and disturb. The film spawned several sequels, and then a 2003 remake (which I thought was pretty good, all things considered). That remake spawned a prequel (which was not pretty good, all things considered). Then there was the confusing (and terrible) <em>Texas Chainsaw 3D</em>, which was apparently meant to be a direct sequel to the original movie although the timeline didn&#8217;t add up at all (for instance: star Alexandra Daddario, who was 25 at the time of release and looked even younger, was supposed to be playing a character about to turn 40). In 2017 there was yet another prequel, <em>Leatherface</em>, which failed to generate any real buzz.</p>\n<p>Will this latest reboot fare better? I guess we&#8217;ll see.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/texas-chainsaw-massacre-reboot-poster/\">&#8216;Texas Chainsaw Massacre&#8217; Reboot Poster Brings Back the Face of Madness</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=RsjlKYWcLtU:kM7KxN9lff4:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=RsjlKYWcLtU:kM7KxN9lff4:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=RsjlKYWcLtU:kM7KxN9lff4:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=RsjlKYWcLtU:kM7KxN9lff4:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=RsjlKYWcLtU:kM7KxN9lff4:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=RsjlKYWcLtU:kM7KxN9lff4:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/RsjlKYWcLtU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 21 Oct 2020 00:00:12 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/texas-chainsaw-reboot-poster-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"76774acb74d3fcc855895d38074491c9","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn28@2020_2/2020/10/21/01-30-12-182_b0bcd09895f124e3.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":55239,"destBytes":41110,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/texas-chainsaw-reboot-poster-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn28@2020_2/2020/10/21/01-30-12-182_b0bcd09895f124e3.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/poster-1-1-700x1037.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn29@2020_2/2020/10/21/01-30-55-693_186edaeb124ec2a0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn97@2020_5/2020/10/21/01-30-55-602_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=RsjlKYWcLtU:kM7KxN9lff4:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn61@2020_2/2020/10/21/01-30-56-560_b856858ab7b95f3f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn17@2020_2/2020/10/21/01-30-56-572_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=RsjlKYWcLtU:kM7KxN9lff4:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn6@2020_2/2020/10/21/01-30-56-728_b54357b40833aad7.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/RsjlKYWcLtU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn97@2020_2/2020/10/21/01-30-56-623_bf8a5c96b71c9c7e.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603243795480},{"createdTime":"2020-10-21 09:29:55","updatedTime":"2020-10-21 09:29:55","title":"Everything We Learned From ‘Candyman’ Director Nia DaCosta’s Fireside Chat at the Nightstream Film Festival","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=641823","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-611451 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/candyman-release-date-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"candyman release date\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/candyman-release-date-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/candyman-release-date-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/candyman-release-date-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/candyman-release-date.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A spiritual sequel to the Bernard Rose’s 1992 horror movie of the same name, Nia DaCosta’s </span><b><i>Candyman</i></b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> returns to the now gentrified neighborhood of Cabrini-Green in Chicago, Illinois, back where the legend began. Now, nearly 30 years later, DaCosta is hoping not only to frighten audiences with her vision, but to make them question what exactly it is that makes them so afraid.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Maybe you’re watching horror and you’re scared because of the very literal ghost that’s in the room,” muses DaCosta. “But I think, in a horror like this, we want you to also understand why the character’s scared. Not just about the ghost, but what the ghost represents. I find that really fun.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clever, poignant and creative, it’s easy to understand what Jordan Peele saw in the</span><b><i> Little Woods</i></b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> director. A lover of 1970s cinema and a determined writer since the very first time she watched </span><b><i>Apocalypse Now</i></b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at the tender age of 16, DaCosta is an exciting up-and-comer with a vast ocean of ideas, including how to breathe new life into the old bones of </span><i>Candyman</i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"more-641823\"></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response to the many challenges impacting the film community amid the Covid-19 pandemic and the concerns of safety and security that presently come with physical exhibition and festivals, a collective online initiative was launched by the organizers of a number of American genre festivals for the fall season to offer a singular experience for U.S. audiences. Together the Boston Underground Film Festival, Brooklyn Horror Film Festival, North Bend Film Festival, The Overlook Film Festival, and Popcorn Frights Film Festival joined forces under the banner of &#8220;Nightstream&#8221; to present a dynamic and accessible virtual festival in October 2020.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">/Film was lucky enough to attend Nia DaCosta’s ‘Virtual Fireside Chat’ at Nightstream, hosted by Vulture’s Hunter Harris and broadcast across the globe. We learned more than a few things during the filmmaker’s chat with Harris, and we’re thrilled to share what we learned from this very exciting talk about all things</span><i> Candyman</i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Nia DaCosta Still Won’t Say Candyman in the Mirror</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I don’t deal with that tom foolery, and demons, gargoyles, superstitions and things like that.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Listen, the fact that DaCosta won’t mention the name of the man who has a reputation for murdering anyone who acknowledges his presence just means that she’s smarter than the rest of us:</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When I was in elementary school, I think that was the first time I heard someone say, oh, we should say Candyman in the mirror. I was like, you know, I heard about Bloody Mary, that’s not really my thing. Like, I won’t be saying anybody’s names or summoning any demons. But I remember hearing about it, always got dared to do it, I still haven’t, and then eventually I saw the movie and I was like, ‘Oh, that’s Candyman, this is what everyone’s talking about’. Because for me, I grew up in Harlem, across the street from the projects, my school was next to another project complex and so for us, we were like, oh yeah, he’s over there, like he lives there. He haunts that building. And so, it was still a part of my childhood in that way.” </span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Harris points out later in the interview that DaCosta claims she’s not easily frightened, but still won’t say his name in the mirror, DaCosta jokingly replies that she doesn’t have time to deal with demons:</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m not really superstitious either, but yeah I guess that’s my base trauma as a child, being forced to say things in a mirror that I don’t want to say. I also don’t fuck with Ouija boards.”</span></p></blockquote>\n<h2><b>The First Movie DaCosta Saw Yahya Abdul-Mateen II in was </b><b><i>Baywatch</i></b></h2>\n<p><b><i>Watchmen</i></b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span><b><i>Black Mirror</i></b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span><b><i>Us</i></b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span><b><i>The Handmaid’s Tale</i></b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span><b><i>The Greatest Showman</i></b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span><b><i>The Get Down</i></b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Yahya Abdul-Mateen II has graced the set of many productions, and proved himself a fascinating actor to follow through multiple noteworthy projects. The first time DaCosta remembers seeing him? Hilariously enough, it was </span><b><i>Baywatch</i></b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">:</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Yahya, he’s such a&#8230;I don’t want to call him a chameleon, that word gets thrown around a lot, but he can so easily inhabit so many characters, he fits into pretty much any world that you want to put him in. I didn’t realize this, and he’ll hate me for saying this probably, but I think the first thing I actually saw him in was </span><i>Baywatch</i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Which I think was like a hangover watch one day, didn’t even remember him really from that, but like while watching, I was like oh yeah, that guy’s cool, he’s funny. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But I had seen him in so many things, and then Jordan mentioned him to me, he was like hey, I worked with him on </span><b><i>Us</i></b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, he’s really great, and I was like oh yeah! He’s in this, he’s in this, he’s in this. He’s in all these things, and especially I think about his performance in </span><i>Us </i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">where he’s just held back for a lot of it, but the amount of character and that humanity that he put into that work, and knowing that there wasn’t a lot on the page and he really was given the freedom by Jordan to create a person, I was like oh, that’s what I need.”</span></p></blockquote>\n<h2><b>In DaCosta’s adaptation, Candyman doesn’t appear fully formed at first – there is a slow psychological descent into madness, marked by body horror</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first time we get a glimpse of Tony Todd’s iconic Candyman character, it’s through a dreamy, rose-tinted lens, as he appears to Helen from the dark corner of parking lot in all of his fully formed glory. A luxurious wool coat encasing a bloody, hollow chest filled with hungry bees and blinding Helen on sight. DaCosta’s take on the source material will be more of a slow burn, a creeping transformation, a possession in plain sight:</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In the original, he’s already a fully formed…I guess monster, we’ll say, because that’s definitely how he’s positioned in the original film, as a monster. And so, it’s really like a reveal of like, ‘Here’s my chest. I’m fully formed, I’m fully grotesque’ and in this one, we really wanted it to be a slow progression, and for me, I really wanted to trigger the response of like, you know when all of us have had a rash or something, and we’re like, hmm, what’s that? Maybe it’s a heat rash, and then maybe it doesn’t go away for a while and you’re like, hm, interesting. Should I go to the doctor? No, it’s probably fine. And then for a vast majority of people, it goes away. In this movie, of course, it doesn’t go away, it gets worse, and so I wanted to have that effect. If someone goes home after watching this movie and looks at their own rash, or bump, or mosquito bite and is a little more freaked out, then I’ve done my job. And that’s really what I wanted to do, it’s about getting inside the head of the audience and really viscerally disturbing them and tracking it psychologically with the sense of the main character.”</span></p></blockquote>\n<h2><b>Both Daniel from Bernard Rose’s </b><b><i>Candyman</i></b><b> (1992) and Anthony McCoy from Nia DaCosta’s </b><b><i>Candyman</i></b><b> (2021) Are Artists</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although DaCosta sought to make her own vision, the director still recognizes and appreciates certain aspects of Rose’s film, and sees the virtue in maintaining a sense of connectivity to the early ‘90s horror classic:</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Part of it being based in the art world was we really wanted to talk about Daniel Robitaille, he was an artist and that’s how he met the woman who he fell in love with and would eventually lead to his demise. Again, it was like okay, it’s a story about identity and artists, especially a fine artist, who’s really the only point of contact between himself and the art and the audience — you know as a director, I consider myself as an artist, but hundreds of people make a movie, but for a fine artist like Anthony, it’s him. And so, it’s really about self-expression, like who you are, and this movie is so much about who he is, and his self-actualization, sort of coming-of-age. I think him being an artist in that way as well was useful because it’s such a direct medium. Also, working in the art world is a very white space and it’s about self-expression, but it’s also about the self-expression that people want, or that they want to buy, that they want to engage with in a monetary sense, which is basically all art, you know?&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DaCosta also sees the literal ways in which setting her movie in the art world can benefit her horror story:</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It was important because it’s so much about identity and about what violence can look like. It’s not just this very graphic lynch mob, it can also be the force of gentrification, or the micro aggressions inside of trying to negotiate what your next art piece is going to be. It has many forms, so that’s part of what we wanted to talk about in this film as well. And that’s a big reason why he fits in the art world, because he can really show that in an interesting way.”</span></p></blockquote>\n<h2><b>Nia DaCosta and Jordan Peele worked Hard to Make the Character of Candyman a Physical Representation of his Chicago Setting</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Born in Brooklyn, raised mostly in Harlem, DaCosta has been a New Yorker since birth, and she deeply understands the way a city can come to define a part of your soul. When it came time to reimagine Chicago, the director understood just how important it was to feel that geography deep in the marrow of the movie:</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The film is so…it’s about things that are really personal to Black people and should be to all Americans, but it’s really about so much trauma and pain and how we grieve and how we engage with it. I’m from New York City, my parents are Jamaican, my dad’s from England, Yahya,’s from New Orleans, grew up in the Bay. We have very different experiences as Black people. He’s a man, I’m a woman. So, it’s so useful in that sense to come from our own perspectives, but talk about our own collective, what brings us together, which, in this, unfortunately, is pain. I think from that, when you’re trying to figure out what’s the point of view of my character, what this journey means or how do we make this journey feel real. What does this journey look like? And then bring our own experiences, but obviously, leaning on Yahya to fill in anything that wasn’t on the page, is how we built the character together. Which feels really general and generic, but I think for me, it was about looking at how we see the world together and then trying to pinpoint it inside of the character, this artist. This Chicago-an, this man who grew up in the projects, and is now moving into a high rise with his rich girlfriend. So just really step by step, going from the macro, okay the world, everything that we’re talking about, to the micro, like you are a boogeyman now.” </span></p></blockquote>\n<h2><b>David Cronenberg’s </b><b><i>The Fly </i></b><b>(1986) and Roman Polanski’s </b><b><i>Rosemary’s Baby </i></b><b>(1968) Are Huge Influences for DaCosta</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When asked about her cinematic influences, DaCosta was quick to gush over a few of her favorite horror movies. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The two that I told basically everyone to watch were </span><b><i>The Fly</i></b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> because it has body horror and that film is amazing,” swoons DaCosta. “I’m a huge Cronenberg fan, and the central relationship between the two characters, the fact that it’s also sort of a love story, I really love. That was really important. And then </span><b><i>Rosemary’s Baby</i></b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, another film that I’ve loved for a long time, I think the psychological terror in that film is really great.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DaCosta again stresses the importance of setting and its undeniable impact on the authenticity of a film:</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The psychological descent of that character, but also the production design and the way Polanski photographs New York I think is really amazing, and wonderful and creepy, but very recognizable New York, and that’s something I wanted to do for Chicago. So, those were two horror movies for this movie in particular that I wanted everyone to watch.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>\n<h2><b>Horror is a Double-Edged Sword that Helps and Hurts Black Filmmakers</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The horror genre has become the default vehicle for discussing difficult issues in films, especially when it comes to talking about race, racism and racial violence. Although DaCosta is aware of the advantages that this popular mode of storytelling has afforded her as of late, she is still hesitant to fully sing its praises:</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “I kind of see it two-fold, right? Like, one is like it’s really great that we have this tool, I think genre is really important, especially horror. Well, not especially horror. Let’s say for now, in particular, horror, for getting more people just to come see what the movie is, because people watch horror films. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then, too, really getting inside of an experience and inside of a place where they feel what the characters are feeling, at least enough to really empathize with them and to really receive the message, which I think is really important, especially when it comes to racial violence and racial trauma. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The other side of it is also like, those are the movies that they’re letting us make. You know? Like, especially after </span><b><i>Get Out</i></b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Like, even then, the risk with </span><i>Get Out</i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> was five million dollars for Blumhouse? Which is not a huge budget for any movie, and that made 200 million dollars. And so now, people are starting to invest a little more because this very specific type of film seems to be what people want to see. What people want to see is something new, which is what </span><i>Get Out</i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> gave us, and very successfully did. So I think on the one hand, it’s very exciting and it is very useful, it’s a great tool. This is my first studio film and it gave me an opportunity to make a movie, but I also think we need to get some different types of ways to talk about really important things like racial terror.”</span></p></blockquote>\n<h2><b>Bernard Rose’s Candyman was of its time in 1992, and DaCosta’s Candyman will be very much of its own time</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So this film, I mean we shot it in the summer of 2019 and I think the very first drafts were in in summer of 2018,” recalls DaCosta. “Rewrites were happening all of last year, and even this year, we did some more shooting which was really great. The conversation which the film is apart of is much bigger than just the film. I think all films, even though they’re complex and they can contain a lot, and can show lots of points of view, they’re all static, they all are just a flash in the pan in the grand scheme of things. That’s basically what I mean, it’s of 2020, it’s </span><i>Candyman</i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, it’s gendered, when a lot of women and non-binary individuals are also victims of the kind of violence that we talk about in the film.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p>She continues:</p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s also like, George Floyd was murdered a week before the film was originally supposed to come out and you know… the unfortunate thing was, every decision I made in making this film, in the balance between the trauma at the core of it, and like the horror and the entertainment was always because I — you know, the country we live in, I knew there was always going to be another person, or persons, who was gonna die in this awful way. The unfortunate reality of this year in particular and just the way I think things are hitting, the film’s also a part of that. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This space in time, this collective trauma. You know, I was reading that this summer has been the largest Civil Rights movement in modern history, and I think a lot of that is not just because we’re tired, we’re sick and tired of it, it’s also because of all of the other issues that we’re dealing with affect racial violence. Climate change affects racial violence. The pandemic, Jesus, four times as many black people are dying from the disease, and it’s not because we have bad immune systems. It’s systemic. So I think that’s part of it, too.
