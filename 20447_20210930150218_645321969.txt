Basic spectroscopic characterization and measurement of a refractive index\r\nwere performed. Each sample was tested as an active medium of a 2 µm laser, longitudinally\r\ndiode-pumped at 786 nm. Tm 3+ concentration dependence of laser parameters was investigated. The\r\nhighest slope efficiency of 43% w.r.t. absorbed power in the pulsed regime and 35% in the CW regime\r\nwas achieved with the 2.4 at.% (Tm/Gd) sample.
