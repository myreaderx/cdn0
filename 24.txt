In this entry, we chat with Ollie Downey about the cinematography of Hanna season two. </em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Stepping into the second season of a television show is a tricky proposition. As the new guy, you were not there when the style, tone, and general aesthetic formed during the previous season. The gang did their job already. You&#8217;re here to fall in line and work within the established parameters. Those that bash against the mold break themselves, not the mold.</p>\n<p>What came before in <strong><em>Hanna</em></strong> was what attracted <strong>Ollie Downey</strong> to the series. He was a fan, and he wanted in. His vision aligned with what Sarah Adina Smith and cinematographer Dana Gonzales concocted in the first two episodes, and their look built off the original Joe Wright film. Fairy tale super-spy action. Saying &#8220;yes&#8221; to all those words is easy.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Dana is a great DP,&#8221; says Downey. &#8220;His work in the first episode is lovely. It&#8217;s really beautiful. It&#8217;s quite sophisticated and sensitive and cinematic for TV drama. That was a really attractive thing to try and follow.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Downey operates as the cinematographer on the first and last block of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Hanna-Season-2/dp/B087C8X5V2\"><em>Hanna</em>&#8216;s second season</a> with an assist from Stephen Murphy on the middle three episodes. The strategy allows for extensive preparation for the back half, including a furious sprint of globe-hopping. Television moves at the speed of a blitz; you have to build time where there is none.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s about the imagery in the early days of production,&#8221; says Downey. &#8220;You have limited time at the very beginning of prep with directors, and you can be playing catch up because they&#8217;ve already been on for a month or two, as has the production designer and the location manager.&#8221;</p>\n<p><iframe title=\"Hanna Season 2 - Official Trailer\" width=\"700\" height=\"394\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6Rm3twwVy1s?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>Inspiration must come quickly. Again, you repeat the words in your mind, &#8220;fairy tale super-spy action.&#8221; Downey fully absorbed the first season into his being and went from there.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I tend to get a load of images that are relevant to different story arcs and different countries or locations,&#8221; explains Downey. &#8220;I put them in a Dropbox file and divide them up. I just keep firing them at the director and start to strike out the ones you don&#8217;t like and discuss what you do like about the ones that remain in that folder.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Falling into the form built by Gonzales removes one burden. The look is there, and it&#8217;s distinct. Once Downey determined the borders he could work within, he could let his philosophy of the image fill in the gaps.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It makes it easier to imbue some of that in what you&#8217;re doing,&#8221; he continues. &#8220;You take the stuff you really like, the beautiful sensitivity &#8212; the softness, the slightly fairyness &#8212; the sensitivity to Hanna&#8217;s plight, and bring it into this bigger world that you&#8217;re developing with all these new recruits that are going out into the world to do what Hanna was trained for.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In season two, some of the fairy tale elements fade away. The coming-of-age story becomes the focus. In the narrative, Downey pulls the visual language.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It has a mother-daughter relationship at its core,&#8221; he says. &#8220;It still needed that vulnerability to it, and the cinematography had to sort of be sympathetic to the emotional state of the recruits &#8212; these orphaned young women who are going through adolescence in this very extreme environment.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The second season opens with Hanna (Esme Creed-Miles) deep within the Romanian forest alongside her comrade Clara (Yasmin Monet Prince). Escape from the Utrax assassin syndicate is within their grasp, however, when they bust into a remote cabin and discover a photograph depicting a nameless mother and daughter. A desire within Hanna to understand her biological beginnings ignites.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Because the location&#8217;s strange,&#8221; says Downey, &#8220;it naturally takes on a slightly different life of its own. It&#8217;s not quite so dark and Eastern European. It&#8217;s in this quite reasonably bright, austere country mansion in Northern England. So, that in itself takes on some stylings as did the work of the production designer, Carly [Reddin].&#8221;</p>\n<p>Through an unexpected turn of events, the second block of episodes started shooting before the first block finished. The result being that Downey&#8217;s last batch of shows was slightly delayed in pre-production, giving him a few extra days to prepare. More time is more time. Downey didn&#8217;t question; he took advantage.</p>\n<p>&#8220;When you&#8217;re doing the second block,&#8221; he says, &#8220;you&#8217;re guided by watching all the rushes from the first block. You have the same costumes and the same locations. It gives you a visual continuity.&#8221;</p>\n<p>To maintain this continuity, Downey and colorist Asa Shoul designed a LUT (Look Up Table) based on what came before. The LUT allows the cinematographer in post-production to transform their source image into the image they want it to be by calibrating and correcting the color. Armed with the LUT, Downey could go into the second block of episodes, which also required a massive change of scenery, with confidence.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We shot the first ten weeks in London, Wales, Paris, and Dunkirk,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Then we jumped over to Barcelona for a couple of months in the end. It&#8217;s logistically challenging, but you trust in your crew. I work with a great camera operator, John Hembrough, and a great grip in Phil Whittaker. They take care of their side of things.&#8221;</p>\n<p>While Downey never falls into the mode of automatic, going into shooting with a finely honed LUT and a crew of die-hard and capable enthusiasts nurtures a state of contentment on set. The preparation is the armor against surprise, including impossible to predict weather patterns.</p>\n<p>&#8220;One day we&#8217;re in a forest in Wales,&#8221; continues Downey, &#8220;and it&#8217;s raining, and then the sun&#8217;s out, and then it&#8217;s raining again. A week later, we were in Paris in a fifth-floor apartment with a broken lift on the hottest day ever recorded. Forty-three degrees Celsius [that&#8217;s 109 degrees Fahrenheit for Yanks].&#8221;</p>\n<p>All film sets are a matter of bobbing and weaving. Downey and co. improvise and adapt. The shot is always achievable.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was a wild ride, but it&#8217;s brilliant,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Just so enjoyable. I&#8217;d do it all again in a heartbeat.&#8221;</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong><em>Hanna</em> season two is now streaming on Amazon Prime.

They may no longer travel on our plane of reality, but they continue to impact the world with the art they left behind. Here is our opportunity to thank Bruce Lee for radically altering the energy of action in The Big Boss.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>America did not want <strong>Bruce Lee</strong>. Or, at least, America did not want the Bruce Lee that Bruce Lee was and wanted to be. Sidekick was acceptable. Supporting player was fine. A behind-the-scenes martial arts instructor was even better, but Bruce Lee could not be the star.</p>\n<p>After a year of playing second fiddle to Van Williams in <em>The Green Hornet</em>, the TV series was canceled in 1967. Lee fought for every second of screentime, and in retrospect, his Kato remains the only remarkable aspect of the show with maybe a tiny exception for the theme song that Quentin Tarantino would repurpose decades later in <em>Kill Bill Volume 1</em>. Ah, but to give such credit to the director after his painfully disrespectful portrayal of Lee in <em>Once Upon a Time&#8230; in Hollywood</em> sours the stomach (let&#8217;s save this emotion for another article at a later date&#8230; moving on).</p>\n<p>Lee struggled to make an impression in Hollywood. There were a few walk-on roles in <em>Ironside</em> and <em>Blondie</em>. In the movie <em>Marlowe</em>, he&#8217;s the heavy hitter Winslow Wong, who tears James Garner&#8217;s office apart. In <em>Longstreet</em>, Lee returns for several episodes and even has an opportunity to relate a bit of his <a href=\"https://bruceleefoundation.org/jeetkunedo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jeet Kune Do</a> philosophy to star James Franciscus. Again, his appearances in these stories are the only thing that makes them worth watching or mentioning.</p>\n<h2>The Warrior and rejection</h2>\n<p>At the time, <em>Longstreet&#8217;s creator</em>, Stirling Silliphant, was a student of Lee and practiced Kung Fu alongside other disciples such as James Coburn and Steve McQueen. While Lee waited for Warner Bros. to consider his pitch for <em>The Warrior</em>, a Western series following a Shaolin monk navigating various outlaw towns, these lessons were his primary income. In fear of losing the mortgage on their house, his wife Linda worked nights at a telephone answering service.</p>\n<p>Warner Bros. eventually rejected <em>The Warrior</em>, claiming American audiences would not watch a Chinese actor. Instead, they rescrambled Lee&#8217;s ideas into <em>Kung Fu</em> and cast David Carradine as the lead, complete with yellowface makeup and prosthetics used to slant his eyes. The studio claimed they were already in the process of developing a similar idea when Lee approached them with his pitch. Therefore, the actor&#8217;s name appears nowhere in the credits.</p>\n<p>In 1969, Bruce Lee, along with Silliphant and James Coburn, developed a script for a film called <em>The Silent Flute</em>. Lee envisioned the project as a way for him to introduce Americans to Eastern philosophy. If ignorance existed in the audience, he would drag them into an education. The impact of these punches contained thought, not mere brutality.</p>\n<p>Despite flying to India for location shooting, <em>The Silent Flute</em> could not secure financing and fell apart. Five years after Lee&#8217;s death in 1973, Silliphant would complete the script with Stanley Mann, and due to Lee&#8217;s posthumous celebrity, AVCO Embassy Pictures supplied the cash. Once again, David Carradine was cast in a role meant for Bruce Lee.</p>\n<h2>Hong Kong and acceptance</h2>\n<p>Everything changed when Lee flew to Hong Kong to retrieve his mother. She was lonely and wanted to be with her children and grandchildren in the United States. A mob met Lee the moment he stepped off the plane.</p>\n<p>He didn&#8217;t understand. Why? He was no one in America.</p>\n<p>While virtually ignored in Hollywood, Hong Kong saw his success on <em>The Green Hornet</em> as a triumph. It should have been a quick trip to his home country but transformed into a whirlwind tour of Hong Kong programming. Lee appeared on one late-night talk show after another. There was money here.</p>\n<p>Lee reached out to the Shaw Brothers, inquiring if they would be interested in making a film together. The Shaw Brothers offered Lee $2,000 per movie in a long-form contract, which Lee took as an insult. Crestfallen, he flew back to Los Angeles.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the son of director Lo Wei caught Lee during one of these Hong Kong TV appearances and encouraged his father to explore the possibility of casting him in a film. Lo Wei agreed and brought Lee&#8217;s attention to Golden Harvest studio boss Raymond Chow, who had already heard about the rebuffed offer. Chow had recently splintered from the Shaw Brothers, and his films struggled to compete. He needed a hit, and he saw potential in Lee&#8217;s charisma.</p>\n<p>A few years earlier, Lee would never have signed a two-film contract in Hong Kong, but he was as desperate as Chow. The money was not as significant as what he thought Hollywood would eventually give him, but the mortgage required payment asap, not tomorrow. Two films for $15,000 at Golden Harvest sufficed, and his wife quit her gig at the answering service.</p>\n<h2>The Big Boss</h2>\n<p><strong><em>The Big Boss</em></strong> was already in production and meant to star action-heavy James Tien when Lee agreed to join. Chow treated the film like a test. As they shot the first third of the script, Chow and Lo Wei (who replaced original director Wu Chia-hsiang almost immediately) keenly observed both actors. When they eventually decided Lee contained the most magnetism, they killed Tien&#8217;s character to make room.</p>\n<p>In the film, Cheng Chao-an (Lee) is a Chinese drifter who moves to Thailand to work in an ice factory alongside his cousin Hsu Chie (Tien). The two men soon learn that the ice they&#8217;re hauling is filled with bags of heroin and they&#8217;re jobs are a front for a massive drug trafficking ring controlled by Hsiao Mi (Han Ying-chieh), &#8220;the big boss.&#8221; Cheng wants to help his cousin defeat the kingpin, but an oath made to his mother prevents him from acting out violently.</p>\n<p>The first third of <em>The Big Boss</em> operates like an agonizing pleasure delayer. Sitting from our point in time, we know Lee is destined to spring into action, but the film refuses to let the badass off the leash. Tien is one-hundred percent the hero of the movie until Hsu Chie&#8217;s men slaughter him in the boss&#8217; garden, and jam his mutilated body into blocks of ice.</p>\n<p>Lee finally erupts into the legend we know during a riot at the factory. The Chinese workers rise against the Thai management, and while Cheng attempts to keep to the sides of the skirmish, a bumbling goon stumbles into his person. In the process, the jade amulet representing Cheng&#8217;s promise to his mother tears from his neck. Cheng explodes and rips through the mass of unsuspecting flesh.</p>\n<p>Bruce Lee is what separates <em>The Big Boss</em> from the Hong Kong action films that came before. The actors around him came from the Peking opera style, where the fighting was a ballet deserving a languished attention from the camera. Lee was a street fighter. When he fought, he fought to win. Fights should be in one-two-three beats &#8212; wham, blam, slam &#8212; and end quickly.</p>\n<p>Lee&#8217;s refusal to partake in the accepted choreography of the system is one of the reasons that lead to the dismissal of Wu Chia-hsiang. There are no three-minute action shots in <em>The Big Boss</em>. Lee sold his attacks in fifteen-second bursts, requiring quick edits, resulting in a profound injection of kineticism. The dance was over. The brawl had begun.</p>\n<h2>An icon-in-motion</h2>\n<p>Lee performed unlike any other Hong Kong actor. His style stemmed from his appreciation for samurai films and their Chanbara manner of performance. Think of Toshiro Mifune in<em> Seven Samurai</em> or Jack Nicholson in <em>The Shining</em>. Bruce Lee does not act for the camera or the audience on the other side of it. Bruce Lee acts to the heavens.</p>\n<p>His iconic howl when delivering a catastrophic blow is an extension of capturing the attention of those in the cheap seats. No one can miss him.</p>\n<p>The result was millions of dollars. No one in China, America, or the rest of the world had ever seen a hero quite like Bruce Lee&#8217;s Cheng Chao-an. What swagger he displayed would only build from here, as <em>The Big Boss</em>&#8216; box office shattered Hong Kong&#8217;s previous top-dollar champ, <em>The Sound of Music</em>, by $2.4 million.</p>\n<p>Bruce Lee only continued to up his game overseas. His follow-ups, <em>Fist of Fury</em> and <em>The Way of the Dragon</em>, were even more distinct, incorporating his personally perfected Jeet Kune Do fighting technique. The fervor these films stirred in China spread to Hollywood, and Warner Bros. finally wanted in on the Bruce Lee business. <em>Enter the Dragon</em> cemented Lee as an immortal action hero who demanded a quick end to combat &#8212; one, two, three &#8212; but an everlasting education of the interior.</p>\n<p><em>The Big Boss</em> is not the final statement of the icon. It&#8217;s the first gasp, but it&#8217;s a magnificent one. Here was a person who knew he had something to offer others but continually met resistance, judgment, ignorance, and hatred. The initial victories came slow and were barely recognizable, but he built from them. Admire the aggressively animated feats of gladiatorial warfare, but aspire to Lee&#8217;s tenacious confidence of self and pursuit of edification.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/Bb70C-vOv40\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 23 Jul 2020 20:16:37 +0000","feedId":24,"bgimg":"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bruce-Lee-The-Big-Boss.jpg","linkMd5":"a6f0db589b25f9641b187708ab59910e","metaImg":"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bruce-Lee-The-Big-Boss.jpg","author":"Brad Gullickson","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/Bb70C-vOv40":null}},{"createdTime":"2020-07-26 01:03:00","updatedTime":"2020-07-25 17:03:00","title":"‘Marriage Story’ Gets the Criterion Treatment in Our Home Video Pick of the Week","link":"https://filmschoolrejects.com/?p=355662","description":"<p class=\"section-divider\"><em>Streaming might be the future, but physical media is still the present.

What starts as a friendly falling out becomes an explosive affair as lawyers, a system fueled on profits and power, and the welfare of a child caught in the middle all play into the mix. Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver are both sensational here, and both earn sympathy and scorn in equal measures. The supporting cast is equally strong with fantastic turns from Ray Liotta, Alan Alda, and Laura Dern. It&#8217;s a surprisingly funny film too, and while there are tough, ugly beats throughout the film and characters always return to warm, honest humor.</p>\n<p>The film is a Netflix production that, like <em>Roma</em> (2018) before it, has now entered the Criterion Collection &#8212; so yeah, expect McG&#8217;s under-appreciated <em>The Babysitter</em> (2017) to get the Criterion treatment soon. It&#8217;s a digipak style that folds open to reveal artwork, a booklet, and reproductions of the letters that the couple writes about each other for their aborted therapy session. The extras include several new interviews and programs surrounding the film&#8217;s production that shed light onto the ideas, themes, and struggles required to see the film through. It&#8217;s a beautiful release and a must-own for fans of the film.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">[Extras: New 4K transfer, interviews, featurettes, booklet essay, letter from Nicole and Charlie to each other]</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--p\">The Best</h3>\n<h4 class=\"graf graf--p\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-355731\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/against-all-flags.jpg\" alt=\"Against All Flags\" width=\"195\" height=\"237\" />Against All Flags [KL Studio Classics]</h4>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong>What is it?</strong> Pirates played by people you know and love!</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong>Why see it?</strong> Pirate movies were big business back in the 40s and 50s, and this minor gem remains towards the top of the heap.

(I still prefer 1984&#8217;s <em>Top Secret</em>, though&#8230;) Jim Abrahams and David &#38; Jerry Zucker deliver a legendary comedy here with a non-stop barrage of gags. If one doesn&#8217;t work for you another is right behind, and while some are dated by today&#8217;s societal norms they&#8217;re harmless in their playfulness.

This is a smart, noir-ish series, that features Gugino as a woman tired of being dicked around by the men in her life &#8212; she&#8217;s forced into going along with things, but she&#8217;s constantly striving to stay one or two steps ahead.

There&#8217;s a seemingly doomed love story at the core of the story, and it fuels each of the two main characters&#8217; drives in parallel story lines en route to each other. Diao Yinan&#8217;s use of landscape and color is often breathtaking, and when stillness explodes into violence it&#8217;s all the more startling for it.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">[Extras: Featurette, interviews, short film]</p>\n<hr />\n<h4 class=\"graf graf--p\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-355737\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/you-dont-nomi.jpg\" alt=\"You Don't Nomi\" width=\"195\" height=\"249\" />You Don&#8217;t Nomi</h4>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong>What is it?</strong> A love letter of sorts to Paul Verhoeven&#8217;s <em>Showgirls</em> (1995).</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong>Why see it?</strong> Some people try, including some in this doc, to defend <em>Showgirls</em> as a stealth masterpiece fully in control of its tone, intentions, and end result, but that&#8217;s nonsense. This is a film that went off the rails fast, and that&#8217;s why we love it (minus the heinously brutal assault scene). The doc explores all sides and opinions and offers interesting commentary and interpretations on the film including through some call backs to other Verhoeven movies. It&#8217;s a fun companion to the film itself.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">[Extras: None]</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--p\">The Rest</h3>\n<h4 class=\"graf graf--p\">Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves [KL Studio Classics]</h4>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong>What is it?</strong> The classic tale gets the big-screen treatment.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong>Why see it?</strong> From his life as a child to his young adulthood among a band of thieves, the film follows one man&#8217;s journey through criminal acts and bouts of bravery. He&#8217;s more than a thief, though, and now he just has to fight to prove it. It&#8217;s a big Technicolor affair, complete with the occasional musical number as songs erupt from nowhere, and fans should be pleased with the Blu-ray.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">[Extras: Commentary]</p>\n<hr />\n<h4 class=\"graf graf--p\">Arabian Nights [KL Studio Classics]</h4>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong>What is it?</strong> Another big Technicolor production from old Hollywood!</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong>Why see it?</strong> Hollywood used to love their epics, and this one fits the bill with an &#8220;Arabian&#8221; set tale of love, intrigue, and brotherly conflict. It&#8217;s a lavish production complete with big sets, intricate costuming, and a good versus evil plot structure. The colors pop in high-definition meaning fans will enjoy its bright visuals, but they&#8217;re not enough to distract from the rough acting and writing.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">[Extras: Commentary]</p>\n<hr />\n<h4 class=\"graf graf--p\">Blood Vessel</h4>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong>What is it?</strong> Stranded sailors face off against a vampire on an otherwise abandoned vessel.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong>Why see it?</strong> Look, this is a fantastic goddamn title for a horror film about vampires at sea, and the movie was never going to live up to it. That said, there&#8217;s fun to be had with this little creature feature that&#8217;s new to VOD this week. The vampire design is fresh and only a little bit silly, the action and suspense are small but effective, and we can never get enough horror movies set during war-time. It has its issues including a poorly written female character and some drag, but fans of small, focused horror films might find enough to enjoy.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">[VOD release]</p>\n<hr />\n<h4>Bloodstone [Arrow Video]</h4>\n<p><strong>What is it?</strong> A stolen gem sees people on the run in India.</p>\n<p><strong>Why see it?</strong> Director Dwight Little had a brief run helming theatrical releases including <em>Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers</em> (1988) and <em>Marked for Death</em> (1990), and in between those two he delivered this romp. The acting and writing are on the goofy side, but it&#8217;s a fun B movie pitting a tough guy on his honeymoon and an opportunist cab driver against all manner of bad guys. Fights, car action, big stunts, and more keep things moving. It&#8217;s silly and maybe a bit dumb, but there&#8217;s fun to be had.</p>\n<p>[Extras: Commentaries, interviews]</p>\n<hr />\n<h4 class=\"graf graf--p\">Buccaneer&#8217;s Girl [KL Studio Classics]</h4>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong>What is it?</strong> A woman gets mixed up with pirates.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong>Why see it?</strong> Yvonne De Carlo is best known from The Munsters, but she had a long career before settling for monstrous motherhood on TV. Here she plays a young woman displaced by pirates who winds up in a brothel before joining back up with the seafaring hoodlums. It&#8217;s light entertainment that&#8217;s never as thrilling or fun as it probably needs to be.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">[Extras: Commentary]</p>\n<hr />\n<h4 class=\"graf graf--p\">Girl Crazy [Warner Archive]</h4>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong>What is it?</strong> A horn-dog meets his match.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong>Why see it?</strong> Judy Garland and Mickey Rooney are a memorable pairing, and here they get to sing and dance to George Gershwin tunes. It&#8217;s a romantic comedy as the young playboy student is drawn to his dean&#8217;s daughter, and teh two bounce back and forth with plenty of banter and antics before recognizing their attraction. It&#8217;s casual fun.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">[Extras: Introduction, commentary, short film, cartoon, audio outtake]</p>\n<hr />\n<h4>Life Is a Long Quiet River [Arrow Academy]</h4>\n<p><strong>What is it?</strong> Two disparate families discover that their children were switched at birth.</p>\n<p><strong>Why see it?</strong> This French comedy of manners introduces two families from dramatically different classes. One is wealthy, the other is broke, and once the error is discovered their children see how the other half lives. The film is set against bigger societal issues throughout the city and country involving immigration and violence, and the humor struggles a bit against the ugliness. Still, fans of low-key humor will enjoy the commentary.</p>\n<p>[Extras: Interviews]</p>\n<hr />\n<h4 class=\"graf graf--p\">The Room</h4>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong>What is it?</strong> A couple finds a mysterious room in their house that grants wishes.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong>Why see it?</strong> This entertaining little thriller was Shudder&#8217;s most-watched Original film this year, and it&#8217;s easy enough to see why. Olga Kurylenko stars, and it has a pretty nifty premise worthy of the <em>Twilight Zone</em>. I&#8217;m of the belief that it stretches the idea a bit thin, though, meaning maybe it would have worked better as a TV episode. Still, there are some interesting and thrilling beats here leading up to a pretty crazy third act, so it&#8217;s definitely worth a watch.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">[Extras: None]</p>\n<hr />\n<h4 class=\"graf graf--p\">Samurai Marathon</h4>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong>What is it?</strong> A sadistic lord demands an arduous marathon for his samurai guards.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong>Why see it?</strong> <em>Candyman</em>&#8216;s Bernard Rose directs this period piece, and the result is an attractive action/drama envisioning the start of a race still run today in Japan. There&#8217;s a class commentary here alongside something of a love story, but the heart of the film is in its beauty and carnage. Philip Glass&#8217; score adds to the former, while sword fights and gun battles infuse the latter. It&#8217;s good stuff.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">[Extras: None]</p>\n<hr />\n<h4 class=\"graf graf--p\">Scoob!</h4>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong>What is it?</strong> An origin story about everyone&#8217;s favorite teen sleuths.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong>Why see it?</strong> Here&#8217;s the deal. Scooby isn&#8217;t meant to have full on goddamn conversations like he does here, and it throws a wrench into what could otherwise be a fun animated movie. It doesn&#8217;t feel right, and worse, it&#8217;s never amusing. Making this early case a huge, supernatural, earth-shaking deal doesn&#8217;t help either. The animation is good though.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">[Extras: Bloopers, deleted scenes, featurettes]</p>\n<hr />\n<h4 class=\"graf graf--p\">Son of Ali Baba [KL Studio Classics]</h4>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong>What is it?</strong> A young man finds adventure and love in ancient Persia.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong>Why see it?</strong> This early 50s Technicolor production has some big visuals and minor action to keep viewers&#8217; attention, but it&#8217;s really Tony Curtis that will hold it best. He doesn&#8217;t really fit here, but he&#8217;s a charismatic guy all the same as he charms women and men alike on his way towards love and power. Piper Laurie co-stars.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">[Extras: Commentary]</p>\n<hr />\n<h4 class=\"graf graf--p\">Survive the Night</h4>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong>What is it?</strong> Two criminals hold a family hostage.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong>Why see it?</strong> Bruce Willis already starred in a film called <em>Hostage</em> (2005) about a home invasion, and it&#8217;s far superior to this harmless but uneventful direct to video effort. He&#8217;s second fiddle here to Chad Michael Murray, and should probably tell you all you need to know. It&#8217;s just never all that engaging, and the effort to demonize one criminal while humanizing the other feels like drag.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">[Extras: Featurette, interviews]</p>\n<hr />\n<h4 class=\"graf graf--p\">The World in His Arms [KL Studio Classics]</h4>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong>What is it?</strong> A ship captain rides the wives in pursuit of love.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong>Why see it?</strong> Gregory Peck headlines and competes with Anthony Quinn in this seafaring adventure that sees both men pursuing Ann Blyth who&#8217;s on the run from an unwieldy engagement. Big, bold cinematography competes with effects shots to convey the ocean life as the film bounces between adventure and hopeful romance. It&#8217;s an engaging watch with a charismatic Peck captaining the tale through to the end.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">[Extras: Commentary]</p>\n<hr />\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong>Also out this week:</strong></p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><em>Capone, Castle Rock &#8211; The Complete Second Season, Colonel Real, Confidence, John Wick: Chapters 1-3 [4K UltraHD], Mephisto, Resistance, Spartacus [4K UltraHD], Taste of Cherry [Criterion Collection]</em></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/ORHVZ1oQy7s\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 24 Jul 2020 01:16:36 +0000","feedId":24,"bgimg":"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/marriage-story-1.jpg","linkMd5":"a6da8f42b99c7eb3f9b1a1b8399ac6e5","author":"Rob Hunter","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/marriage-story-1.jpg":null,"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/against-all-flags.jpg":null,"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/airplane-1.jpg":null,"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/clueless.jpg":null,"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ghost.jpg":null,"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/jett-1.jpg":null,"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/the-wild-goose-lake.jpg":null,"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/you-dont-nomi.jpg":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/ORHVZ1oQy7s":null}},{"createdTime":"2020-07-26 01:03:01","updatedTime":"2020-07-25 17:03:01","title":"‘The Tick’ Never Could Catch a Break","link":"https://filmschoolrejects.com/?p=355701","description":"<p><em>Welcome to <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/topics/petition-worthy/\"><strong>Petition Worthy</strong></a>, a biweekly column that revisits canceled TV shows that we wish had a longer lifespan. In some cases, we’ll also make a plea for them to be given another chance. This time, we consider The Tick.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>There’s an old phrase that says the third time is the charm. This mantra isn’t true when it comes to <strong><em>The Tick</em></strong>. There have been three shows dedicated to the satirical superhero. Of those shows, only the mid-&#8217;90s animated series, which marked the character’s first screen incarnation, was a moderate hit. The two subsequent live-action iterations (debuted in 2001 and 2017) were short-lived and quickly canceled.</p>\n<p>Maybe this hero is just too weird for general audiences. The character was conceived by Ben Edlund in 1986 as a deconstruction of superheroes. The Tick is essentially a well-meaning airhead who started fighting crime through a combination of boredom and a hunger for justice. He’s all brawn and no brains, and his enemies are downright bizarre. Take Chairface, for example, a supervillain whose face is a chair. Edlund&#8217;s an off-kilter creator, and his imagination is a thing of beauty.</p>\n<p>That said, re-introducing the Tick to the screen in 2017 made some sense. The success of the film <em>Deadpool</em> the previous year showed that the world was ready for more leftfield takes on the superhero genre. But Rob Liefeld’s fourth-wall-breaking antihero is polished with a Marvel sheen. The Tick has always been a low-rent weirdo who mainly appeals to nerds and stoners. Making him too accessible would taint his legacy.</p>\n<p>Then again, the recent Amazon Studios series doesn’t go too off the rails with the deconstructive elements. It’s actually a conventional superhero story in many ways. The inherently comedic and weird aspects of the lore remain intact, but the approach to storytelling is more focused and formulaic. It did just enough to cater to modern genre fans while being wacky enough to stand out in a populated superhero television landscape.</p>\n<p>However, the series has more heart and charm than most modern superhero fare. It&#8217;s an earnest love letter to the genre, and that sweetness is even apparent during the scenes of carnage and bloodletting. But it&#8217;s still pretty strange. Any show with lobster monsters and robot ninjas will be. <em>The Tick</em> has always been affectionate toward superheroes, though. Even when it&#8217;s lampooned them.</p>\n<p>The series&#8217; story follows Arthur (<strong>Griffin Newman</strong>), whose obsession with superheroes and conspiracies has become a cause of concern to his loved ones. When he was a child, a group of the city&#8217;s superbeings accidentally killed his father. As an adult, he spends his time trying to hunt down The Terror (<strong>Jackie Earle Haley</strong>). He blames the baddie for his father&#8217;s death, and he&#8217;s convinced that the supervillain is still out there. No one else believes him, at least not until he meets a noble cohort in the form of the Tick.</p>\n<p>The decision to center the show on Arthur is a wise one. While a show that centered around the titular hero could have been fun, the decision to minimize his involvement works well. The Tick gives the show its moments of goofy charm and old-school pazazz. Arthur, meanwhile, provides compelling character beats and keeps the story grounded, to a degree. I also love the decision to make a character who is a sidekick in the comics the main focus. It&#8217;s a refreshing take that hasn&#8217;t been explored in other <em>Tick</em> media.</p>\n<p><strong>Peter Serafinowicz</strong> nails the role of the eponymous crusader. He looks ridiculous in the blue insectoid costume and gives his best golden age superhero impression. At the same time, he also comes across as a good-natured simpleton who’s completely out of touch with reality. That’s exactly who the Tick is, and Serafinowicz gets completely absorbed in the part. The actor is a wonderful comedic talent, and he was born to play this role.</p>\n<p><em>The Tick</em> is inherently silly and tongue-in-cheek, but the show makes a genuine effort to tell an engrossing story without completely abandoning the lore&#8217;s goofy roots. Turning a show like this into a parody of superheroes and their popularity would have been the easy route to take. Finding that balance of drama and laugh-out-loud humor isn&#8217;t easy, but the show nails the tone. The funniest moments involve the Tick awkwardly spouting superhero catchphrases. Especially while he&#8217;s embroiled in some gritty and deadly situations that make his words seem out of place.</p>\n<p>The series also expands the lore, as opposed to adapting what&#8217;s been told before. The backstory of each character isn’t explored in the comics. They are paired up and immediately thrust into a world of action and adventure. They don&#8217;t turn back after that. Here, their relationship is more developed and the story delves deeper into their origins. If the show had continued for more than two seasons, both characters could have been fleshed out even more. Their mystery is part of the charm of the comics, but the show&#8217;s approach is well-handled and intriguing in its own right.</p>\n<p>Amazon cut the series after two seasons, maintaining the character’s unfortunate fate in the screen realm. The timing was awful, though, as the second season is even better than the first. <em>The Tick</em> gets funnier and more ambitious as it progresses, introducing a range of strong characters who are just as interesting as the leads. The series was killed just as it was about to really soar.</p>\n<p>Of course, you don’t have to be familiar with the comics to appreciate the series. The show set out to be its own thing and re-introduce the character for the modern age. But it also aimed to fill in some gaps for long-term fans who have always wanted to learn more about characters who’ve been around for more than thirty years. This should have catered to newcomers and diehards alike, but it wasn&#8217;t to be.</p>\n<p>Attempts to resurrect the show were made following its cancelation. Fans took to social media to drum up support, and Edlund tried his best to find a new home for his baby. Unfortunately, the networks and streaming services weren&#8217;t interested. However, to paraphrase the creator: when the time is right, <a href=\"https://www.thewrap.com/the-tick-really-is-dead-creator-confirms-no-new-network-stepped-up-after-amazon-cancellation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the Tick will return again</a>.

This time, consider the Palm Springs ending.</i></p>\n<hr />\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oh, other people’s weddings. The events we absolutely love to hate. The sappy vows, the ceremony that seems to last forever, the less-than-stellar catering. Wacky weddings have always served as a great finale or even centerpiece for a good rom-com. Take, for instance, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bridesmaids</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">27 Dresses</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or literally any Shakespeare comedy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But what if instead of being the icing on the cake of a meet-cute or a hilarious roadblock on a journey of self-discovery, it’s a horror-scape from which you literally cannot break free? Now, that’s a whole different ball game. And that’s the premise of Max Barkabow’s </span><strong><i>Palm Springs</i></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which follows Nyles (<strong>Andy Samberg</strong>), a jaded wedding attendee who has found himself in an</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_films_featuring_time_loops\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> infinite time-loop</a> and has subsequently resigned himself to witness those “I dos” for eternity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He&#8217;s soon joined by Sarah (<strong>Cristin Milioti</strong>), another guest who gets sucked into the loop. Though he’s convinced nothing could possibly take him by surprise ever again, Nyles quickly discovers that being trapped in the loop with another person is a game-changer and might just give the waking nightmare some meaning. The two embark on a journey comprised of attempts to escape, trying to make the most of every day, and &#8212; yup, you guessed it &#8212; falling in love. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From the outset, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Palm Springs</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> takes on the same tired trope of repeating the same day over and over that was popularized by </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Groundhog Day</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and has proliferated into a genre in itself, with films including </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Happy Death Day</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,</span> <i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source Code</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, <em>Premature</em>, <em>Edge of Tomorrow</em>, and numerous others. But, with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Palm Springs</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> grand finale taking a surprising sentimental twist, Barkabow takes the trope and turns it into something new. So, what’s up with that ending? Let’s dive in.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After a romantic camping trip together, Sarah realizes she has feelings for Nyles. That paired with her being forced to wake up next to her sister’s fiance every morning gives her enough of a motivation to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">really</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> break the time-loop. So, she hunkers down and learns all there is to know about quantum physics (easy enough), and then she tests out her theory on a goat (which thankfully survives). The idea is to blow up the cave and use the 3.2 seconds that it takes to be propelled outward by the blast and subsequently transported back to that morning to flee the loop. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s important to note what Sarah is <em>actually</em> doing here with physics, as the details might give us more insight into what really happens at the end of the film. Sarah studies up on &#8220;String Theory,&#8221; which argues that, instead of being made up of tiny particles, the world actually comprises of one-dimensional strings that interact through vibrations. There&#8217;s one problem with String Theory, though: in order for it to actually function, multiple dimensions would have to exist, and there isn&#8217;t any concrete evidence of this being the case. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When she feels confident enough in her scientific ability, Sarah asks Nyles to come with her. He surprisingly refuses, saying that their life could be great in Palm Springs together, but if they tie explosives to themselves, the result might be less than favorable. “I can’t keep waking up here,” Sarah responds and decides to do it herself anyway. At the last minute, Nyles has a change of heart and tells Sarah that he doesn’t care if the explosion kills them. He’d rather die with her than live without her.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And so, the lovebirds make their way into the cave, adorned with explosive gear. Sarah tells Nyles she loves him back. She presses the detonation button. Then the screen goes black. Did they die? Were they transported to some alternate timeline? Will they simply return to the beginning of the day as usual? Or did they actually manage to escape? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the next shot, Sarah and Nyles lie asleep in a pool on pizza-shaped floats at the house whose owners Nyles had discovered were on vacation. They wake up, and Sarah asks Nyles what he wants to do now. He tells her he wants to go get his dog. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This final interaction is funny, sweet, and indicative of blissful normalcy. Sarah and Nyles acknowledge that they have escaped the time-loop not only by the realization that the owners of the house have returned but, more significantly, by emphasizing the most important thing moving forward: no matter how mundane the “next step” might look, they’re lucky to get to do it together. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, the two seem to think that they have escaped, but this is never actually affirmed. Yes, it’s possible, and even probable, that this is the case, but it’s also possible that the explosion killed them and they&#8217;re actually dead and living in some sunny-California afterlife. <em>Or</em> this <em>new</em> day might be repeated over and over. The final shot could be evidence that they haven&#8217;t <em>quite</em> made it back to &#8220;real life&#8221;: the camera pans up to reveal the same dinosaurs they saw on their camping trip prowling on the horizon, which might indicate that they are still in some alternate reality. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And that&#8217;s where we come back to our String Theory: in order for Sarah&#8217;s explosion experiment to really work, the place that she and Nyles were propelled to had to be another dimension: one in which time works in a linear fashion, and, maybe, one that has dinosaurs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, either </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Palm Springs</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has the ultimate fairy-tale ending &#8212; the lovers make a leap of faith and break the curse &#8212; or it has a darker takeaway, which suggests that they’re dead or stuck in another time-loop.

This entry looks into the making of the car chase in To Live and Die in L.A.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>William Friedkin</strong>&#8216;s take no prisoners attitude is the stuff of legend. This is the man who shoots blank guns on set and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoPI0MRAVB4&#38;feature=emb_title\">films without permits while speeding through New York City </a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoPI0MRAVB4&#38;feature=emb_title\">at ninety miles per hour</a>. The New Hollywood shenanigans bracket is competitive. But Friedkin is outrageous, passionate, and willing to go to great lengths to get what he wants.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not a huge stretch to compare the director to Richard Chance, the hot-blooded cop played by William Petersen in Friedkin&#8217;s cat and mouse neo-noir <em style=\"font-size: 1.14285rem;\"><strong>To Live and Die in L.A.</strong></em> In the film, a fearless federal agent obsessively purses the counterfeiter (Willem Dafoe) who killed his partner, endangering himself and others in the process.</p>\n<p>In many ways, To<em> Live and Die in L.A. </em>epitomizes Friedkin&#8217;s interest in the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blmyOo-KC4w\">thin line between the cop and the criminal</a>. Chance&#8217;s drive to seek and destroy leads him to commit reckless acts. Acts that rival those of the very man he&#8217;s hunting. You know, like speeding the wrong way down a Los Angeles freeway during rush hour.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-355670 alignnone\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/To-Live-And-Die-In-L-A-Chase-3.gif\" alt=\"To Live And Die In L A Chase\" width=\"800\" height=\"427\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/To-Live-And-Die-In-L-A-Chase-3.gif 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/To-Live-And-Die-In-L-A-Chase-3-768x410.gif 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p>In a characteristically dick-out move, Chance and his new, terrified partner Vukovich (John Pankow) hold up a known criminal who is carrying the cash they need to incriminate their real target, the counterfeiter. The robbery goes south, bullets start flying, and someone shoots the courier.</p>\n<p>Soon enough, a simple getaway escalates into a multi-vehicle death race. The pair fails to shake their pursuers through alleyways and flood control channels. And so Chance &#8212; a cop fleeing like a criminal &#8212; is seemingly trapped. A &#8220;wrong way&#8221; sign beckons.</p>\n<p>The tires squeal, and Chance&#8217;s Chevy Impala shoots head-on into traffic. Vukovich falls to pieces in the backseat as Chance weaves wildly between hundreds of oncoming cars, collisions erupting in his wake.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a chase sequence that not only looks but feels real. You can see it on the screen: people <em>did this</em>. No wonky physics, no CGI. How the hell do you orchestrate something like that?</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>How’d they do that?</h2>\n<h3>Long story short:</h3>\n<p>A lot of money and a lot of drivers. Oh, right and by making William Peterson drive the <em>right </em>way down the freeway. Wait&#8230;what?</p>\n<h3>Long story long:</h3>\n<p>According to stunt coordinator <strong>Buddy Joe Hooker</strong>,<a href=\"https://www.mandatory.com/fun/167280-stuntman-buddy-joe-hooker-talks-action\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> the chase scene was never scripted, let alone planned</a><em>. </em>But Freidkin and Hooker would frequently talk shop, and the idea for a chase scene began to take shape.</p>\n<p>According to <em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Hurricane-Billy-Stormy-William-Friedkin/dp/0688078524?tag=fromdevtools-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hurricane Billy: The Stormy Life and Films of William Friedkin</a>, </em>Friedkin first conceived of a car chase against the flow of traffic while driving home from a wedding in 1963. As he tells it, Friedkin fell asleep at the wheel and woke up in the wrong lane headed straight into oncoming traffic. He swerved back to his side of the road and spent the next two decades wondering how he could use the experience in a movie.</p>\n<p>Working with a stripped-down crew and Hooker&#8217;s diagrams, the eight-minute chase took six weeks to film and was the last sequence shot. In the making-of documentary <em>Counterfeit World</em>, Pankow jokes that by shooting the chase at the end of production, if anything were to happen to the lead actors the film would more or less be in the can.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was forty stunt guys, Friedkin, and Pankow and me,&#8221; <a href=\"https://youtu.be/sUJECiO45lA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">remembers Peterson</a>. &#8220;We were going all over LA, blocking off streets and just spinning out.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The film&#8217;s director of photography (and <a href=\"https://youtu.be/XmskzjXarYE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">noted Friedkin enabler</a>) <strong>Robby Müller</strong> declined to shoot the chase over safety concerns, so the second unit cameraman, <strong>Robert D. Yeoman</strong>, came on instead. (Fun fact: Yeoman went on to become Wes Anderson&#8217;s DP of choice. So keep this man&#8217;s enormous balls in mind next time you scoff at a twee center frame.)</p>\n<p>Peterson himself did most of the chase leading up to the freeway stunt. &#8220;I was able to do a lot of the driving stuff, and I wanted to do all of it,&#8221; remembers the actor. &#8220;It got to the point where it was much more fun to be doing the stunts than it was to be doing any of the acting stuff.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/blmyOo-KC4w\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Quote Pankow</a>: &#8220;I didn&#8217;t really have to act. I was terrified a lot of the time.&#8221; Inserts and close-ups of Peterson behind the wheel of the Impala were accomplished with a specially designed hydraulic swivel car that was pulled behind a camera truck.</p>\n<p>In other shots, where we see Chance driving in the camera car, the vehicles in the opposing lanes were stationary. This was apparently Friedkin&#8217;s idea. And according to Hooker, it created a strobe-effect: &#8220;you couldn&#8217;t tell if the cars were moving or not.&#8221;</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-355669 alignnone\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/To-Live-And-Die-In-L-A-Chase-2.gif\" alt=\"To Live And Die In L A Chase\" width=\"800\" height=\"428\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/To-Live-And-Die-In-L-A-Chase-2.gif 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/To-Live-And-Die-In-L-A-Chase-2-768x411.gif 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p>As Peterson describes in a behind-the-scenes featurette, the film rented a portion of a freeway for the weekend and sourced nine-hundred (!) cars to give the impression of rush hour.</p>\n<p>The car Chance drives is specifically a 1985 Chevy Impala F41. The LAPD rented it out, along with several other cars used in the film. Three weekends were spent on sections of the Terminal Island Freeway near Wilmington, California. These were closed for several hours at a time to allow the crew to stage and shoot the nightmarish chase.</p>\n<p>Now, brace yourself for a twist. In the narrative of the film, Chance and Vukovich are driving <em>against</em> traffic. But, in reality, the opposite was true. Petersen and Pankow drove in the correct direction. Meanwhile, &#8220;traffic&#8221; actually flowed <em>backward </em>on the wrong side of the road. This is possible to spot in several brief cuts.</p>\n<p>According to an interview with Hooker on Shout Factory&#8217;s Blu-ray release, one of the reasons Friedkin wanted Petersen and Pankow to drive in that particular direction was &#8220;because there were these beautiful oil refineries with all the lights, and it was a dusk shot. [Friedkin] wanted to see that in the background with the cars going and the only way he could do that was to reverse the flow of the traffic.&#8221;</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a moment near the end of the chase where the eighteen-wheeler jackknifes and squashes the cars in its path. This was Hooker&#8217;s idea. Like all good ideas, he suggested it before he knew how to pull it off.</p>\n<p>To achieve the effect, the stunt team attached the back of the semi to a four-wheel-drive truck. When the tractor and trailer brakes locked up, the truck swung the back of the semi around with the cable.</p>\n<p>As for the train jump, where our heroes outpace and cross in front of an oncoming train, as far as I can tell, they just staged and straight up <em>did</em> that.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>What’s the precedent?</h2>\n<p>Friedkin has a weakness for car chases. If you were to compile a list of the most impressive car chases in cinema, Friedkin&#8217;s name would certainly appear in the top ten&#8230; multiple times. In his memoir, he refers to them as &#8220;the purest form of cinema, something that can’t be done in any other medium, not in literature nor on a stage nor on a painter’s canvas.&#8221;</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-355667 alignnone\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/The-French-Connection-Chase.gif\" alt=\"The French Connection Chase\" width=\"800\" height=\"422\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/The-French-Connection-Chase.gif 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/The-French-Connection-Chase-768x405.gif 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p>In 1971, Friedkin revolutionized the car chase with <strong><em>The French Connection.</em></strong> Shot on open New York City streets, with Gene Hackman doing a good chunk of the stunt driving himself, the sequence contains an exhilarating lack of control (with the unplanned accidents to show for it).</p>\n<p>In the sequence, detective Jimmy &#8220;Popeye&#8221; Doyle (Hackman) commandeers a civilian&#8217;s car and chases after the elevated train on which a hitman is making his escape.</p>\n<p>Basically, the sequence was about as dangerous to shoot as it looks. Much of the chase was shot on busy streets with no traffic control and no permits (Friedkin, on permits: &#8220;<a href=\"https://youtu.be/_O71RkiV4u8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">what are they?</a>&#8220;). It&#8217;s a kinetic, frantic five minutes with Popeye in a Pontiac LeMans careening through unsuspecting traffic at a frightening speed.</p>\n<p>Friedkin has since acknowledged that he endangered lives for the sake of capturing a thrilling sequence. Furthermore, he&#8217;s stated he would never shoot anything the way he shot <em>The French Connection </em>chase again. But, in his memoir, Friedkin admits to feeling a need to surpass <em>The French Connection </em>chase.</p>\n<p>And so, when it came time to brainstorm a chase for <em>The Live and Die in </em><em>L.A. </em>there it was: no one had done an against traffic chase at high speed. Like Dick Chance says: we&#8217;re going this way. While Friedkin may not have necessarily eclipsed his first iconic chase, in my books, he certainly matched it. And <em>with</em> permits no less!</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/dTKZcYpEelk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 25 Jul 2020 15:42:48 +0000","feedId":24,"bgimg":"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/To-Live-And-Die-In-L-A-Chase-3.gif","linkMd5":"138c444508e1f3d034f3cd779cb7780c","author":"Meg Shields","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/To-Live-And-Die-In-L-A-Chase-3.gif":null,"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/To-Live-And-Die-In-L-A-Chase-2.gif":null,"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/The-French-Connection-Chase.gif":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/dTKZcYpEelk":null}},{"createdTime":"2020-07-26 01:03:01","updatedTime":"2020-07-25 17:03:01","title":"‘Steamboat Willie’ Transformed Mickey Mouse From Failure to Champion","link":"https://filmschoolrejects.com/?p=355755","description":"<p><em>Welcome to <a href=\"/topics/saturday-morning-cartoons\"><strong>Saturday Morning Cartoons</strong></a>, our weekly column where we continue the animated boob tube ritual of yesteryear.

With a little help from his friends, Disney took the first steps in building an empire beneath the shadows of another.</p>\n<p>Mickey Mouse did not start as a mouse or a Mickey. He began as merely a counterpoint to Oswald. Disney could do better, but he didn&#8217;t know what &#8220;better&#8221; looked like, or &#8220;who&#8221; better should be. A dog? A cat? A cow? A horse? A frog? All animals considered. All rejected.</p>\n<p>Disney tasked right-hand animator Ub Iwerks to concoct a flurry of design sketches. Ideas sparked, but Disney scoffed one after the other. Any funny animal would not do. To destroy Oswald, it had to be the perfect funny animal.</p>\n<p>Legend states that Disney landed on the mouse as a frame because he adored the tame mouse he once kept on his desk <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/disney-short-toons/\">at his first studio in Kansas City</a>. The reality might be even more elementary. Iwerks simply shortened Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, pushing his ears down and thickening his waist. At first, Disney named the creature Mortimer, but his wife recoiled at the thought and suggested the alternative. Actor Mickey Rooney would have you believe otherwise, at one point claiming he was the inspiration, but there&#8217;s no evidence to such a tale.</p>\n<p>Mickey Mouse made his debut on May 15, 1928, during a test screening of the short film <em>Plane Crazy</em>. Disney and Iwerks co-directed the film, but Iwerks was its only animator, spending two weeks drawing seven-hundred frames a day to complete the project. <em>Plane Crazy</em> did not impress, and no distributor came forward.</p>\n<p>Disney and Iwerks knocked out a second silent Mickey Mouse adventure, <em>The Gallopin&#8217; Gaucho</em>, a comical twist on Douglas Fairbanks&#8217; swashbuckling, no-gallopin&#8217; <em>The Gaucho</em>. Again, few noticed. A key element was still missing.</p>\n<p>In 1927, sound came to cinema via <em>The Jazz Singer</em>. Some saw it as <a href=\"https://www.popularmechanics.com/culture/movies/a19566/a-brief-history-of-sound-in-cinema/\">an abomination</a>, others a declaration. Walt Disney heard the future in Al Jolson&#8217;s voice and knew the Disney aesthetic would eventually connect if they could sell joy and comedy aurally as well as visually.</p>\n<p><em>Plane Crazy</em> and <em>The Gallopin&#8217; Gaucho</em> were rehearsals. <strong><em>Steamboat Willie</em></strong> was always meant to be the big show.</p>\n<p>While Max Fleischer&#8217;s Inkwell Studios was the first company to produce cartoons featuring synchronized sound, they were unable to replicate the experience consistently. Constructed using the Phonofilm system, Fleischer&#8217;s shorts closely maintained harmony between image and sound, but closely synchronized is not synchronized.</p>\n<p>Always looking to crush his opponents, Disney assembled <em>Steamboat Willie</em> applying the Phonofilm&#8217;s competitor Cinephone, as well as a click track, which helped studio musicians keep time with the images (a feature commonly found today in any wannabe Garage Band app).</p>\n<p>As he did for <em>The Gallopin&#8217; Gaucho</em>, Disney drew narrative inspiration for <em>Steamboat Willie</em> from other movies. Six months earlier, Buster Keaton&#8217;s silent comedy <em>Steamboat Bill, Jr.</em> captured the public consciousness, rekindling enthusiasm for the song &#8220;Steamboat Bill&#8221; (the tune Mickey whistles throughout <em>Steamboat Willie</em>). However, rather than following the bumbling theatrics of a paddle steamer captain, Disney elected to demote Mickey Mouse to a potato-peeling lackey with delusions of grandeur.</p>\n<p><em>Steamboat Willie</em> opens with Mickey proudly squeaking his tune while spinning the steamer&#8217;s steering wheel. He&#8217;s toe-tapping, shaking his booty, and blaring the boat&#8217;s three whistles. Enter the real captain, Pete (who started life as a bear three years prior to Mickey, but <em>Steamboat Willie</em> redefined him as a cat, which would make any of us rather cranky). Mickey is tossed from the cabin, and forced to find entertainment through his menial tasks.</p>\n<p>Walt Disney voiced all of the film&#8217;s characters himself, despite there being not a word of comprehensible dialogue. He wrings a spectrum of emotion from Mickey&#8217;s patented falsetto screech, taking the mouse from joyous to exasperated to mischievous and back again. As Mickey transforms the livestock and gadgets around him into a one-man band, Wilfred Jackson&#8217;s score operates as the big showstopper of the piece.</p>\n<p>Sound took Mickey Mouse from a derivative of Oswald the Lucky Rabbit into an icon and corporate godhead. However, there were a few doubters in Disney&#8217;s cadre. Could sound truly elevate the theatrical experience?</p>\n<p>To quash their dissension, before the production of <em>Steamboat Willie</em>&#8216;s soundtrack, Disney demanded a trial screening comprised of employees and their families. On July 29, 1928, a screen was erected in the large room next to Disney&#8217;s office, and a projector was placed outside where it could beam the film through a window, maintaining enough distance, so it&#8217;s incessant whirring wouldn&#8217;t interrupt the performance.</p>\n<p>And, no doubt, it was a performance.</p>\n<p>Iwerks strung a bedsheet across the room behind the movie screen. From behind, Jackson roared on a mouth organ as Iwerks smashed pots and pans, producing Mickey&#8217;s percussive steamer instrumental. In charge of the sound effects was animator Johnny Cannon, rocking slide whistles and spittoons. Disney did his job, squawking and squealing for all of the characters.</p>\n<p>Partially finished, <em>Steamboat Willie</em> was a sensation. The praise from the crowd was extreme, to the point that Disney thought some of them were putting him on, but he couldn&#8217;t dismiss the feeling the event stirred inside. He knew <em>Steamboat Willie</em> earned its applause. He knew the film would take him and his team to the next level.</p>\n<p>The completed short premiered in New York City during the fall of the same year. It was immediately picked up for national distribution. Paired alongside the crime flick <em>Gang War</em>, <em>Steamboat Willie</em> stole its thunder, forever damning the longer adult-themed feature as that boring movie that played after Mickey Mouse.</p>\n<p>Audiences demanded more, and their hunger granted a reprieve to <em>Plane Crazy</em> and <em>The Gallopin&#8217; Gaucho</em>, both of which had theatrical presentations while Disney worked on his next batch of Mickey Mouse shorts. In 1929, Disney produced ten more Mickey cartoons. In 1930, eleven. By the end of the decade, there were 109 Mickey shorts.</p>\n<p>The last Oswald the Lucky Rabbit cartoon debuted in 1938. Universal didn&#8217;t know it at the time, but the second Disney abandoned them, the rabbit died. There could be only one.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/jkzWHOx_QGI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 25 Jul 2020 12:42:18 +0000","feedId":24,"bgimg":"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Mickey-Mouse-Steamboat-Willie.jpg","linkMd5":"511660d521aec07918966725b6d776a3","metaImg":"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Mickey-Mouse-Steamboat-Willie.jpg","author":"Brad Gullickson","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/jkzWHOx_QGI":null}},{"createdTime":"2020-07-26 01:03:01","updatedTime":"2020-07-25 17:03:01","title":"The Talented Mr. Hoffman: Philip Seymour Hoffman as Freddie Miles","link":"https://filmschoolrejects.com/?p=355705","description":"<p><em>Acting is an art form, and behind every iconic character is an artist expressing themselves. Welcome to <strong><a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/topics/great-performances/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Great Performances</a></strong>, a bi-weekly column exploring the art behind some of cinema’s best roles. This entry spotlights Philip Seymour Hoffman as Freddie Miles in The Talented Mr. Ripley.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>At the thirty-five minute mark of <strong><em>The Talented Mr. Ripley</em></strong>, a cherry red Alfa Romeo pulls to a crooked stop in the palazzo of the fictional town of Mongibello. Out climbs Freddie Miles, his bow-tied, cherubic physique standing in stark contrast to nearly every well-chiseled man and lithe woman we&#8217;ve met so far. Taking in the crowded square like a kid in a candy store with his allowance burning a hole in his pockets, he drawls to no one in particular, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you want to fuck every woman you see just once?&#8221;</p>\n<p>As far as entrances go, <strong>Philip Seymour Hoffman </strong>couldn&#8217;t have asked for a better one. While his role in the 1999 Patricia Highsmith adaptation wasn&#8217;t his first, it was the first time we got to see him do what he would do so many more times in his career: take a handful of minutes of screen time and turn them into the most memorable part of the film.</p>\n<p>When we talk about actors we lost too soon, it&#8217;s often as much about the work we missed out on as the work we witnessed, With Hoffman, an actor who never shied away from nuanced and complex characters, it means missing out on something he did perhaps more enjoyably than anyone of his generation: playing an absolute prick that was unendingly fun to watch.</p>\n<p>As Freddie Miles, the snobbish Ivy League rich boy, Hoffman presents us with a grown man who flounces around Europe as a pampered fancy-lad, often seeming only one belt size removed from the prep school uniforms of his spoiled youth. It&#8217;s a familiar character type, one that Hoffman was also likely very familiar with in his real life. As the son of a Xerox executive and a judge, while attending New York University in the 1980s he must have crossed paths with exactly that type of character once or twice.</p>\n<p>The lazy trust-fund layabout is familiar to anyone who passed within a mile of a private school. It&#8217;s an archetype as old as royalty, as marked by their signet rings and sports cars as by their old-money surnames and Kennedy-adjacent family trees. Hoffman inhabits it with the kind of ease that suggests more than a passing familiarity with the Freddies of the world.</p>\n<p>What Hoffman&#8217;s performance really revolves around, what makes him so memorable, is his indulgence. Freddie eats and drinks and fucks his way across Italy, wintering at ski resorts and summering on the Amalfi coast. And even more so than Jude Law&#8217;s Dickie Greenleaf, he exudes the mindless consumption of the wealthy and directionless, from his opening salvo about women, to his sizeable gut, to his absolute and utter dismissal of Matt Damon&#8217;s Tom Ripley the second he judges that he can&#8217;t get anything from him.</p>\n<p>The casual way Freddie pours a full measure of someone else&#8217;s wine into a water glass and knocks it down without so much as a moment&#8217;s pause for an invitation. Much like his real-life proximity to the type of well-heeled elite that populate much of the film, the indulgence was also incredibly familiar to Hoffman. Years before either fame or fortune could have made it a cliche, Hoffman struggled with addiction and checked into rehab at the tender age of twenty-two.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s something that wouldn&#8217;t feel out of place in Freddie Miles&#8217; character bio. Committing to sobriety through his twenties must have given him a unique perspective on characters such as Freddie and the short-sighted results of living a life so fast and loose. And though he stayed sober for much of his adult life, Hoffman <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-news/philip-seymour-hoffmans-last-days-77972/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">told <em>Rolling Stone</em> in 2005</a> that he still had vices: <span style=\"font-size: 1.14285rem;\">“Pure mouth – cigarettes and food, but probably cigarettes more than food.”</span></p>\n<p>This drive for consumption, for overindulgence, kept in check by his sobriety and his intensity for his work, is a central component of Freddie. The character is someone who has never checked his appetites or had them checked for him.</p>\n<p>Freddie&#8217;s greatest hunger is for attention. He chaffs at Tom&#8217;s infiltration of Dickie&#8217;s life, demanding all of his friend&#8217;s attention for himself. Freddie&#8217;s final scene, in which he confronts Tom about Dickie&#8217;s absence and ultimately seals his fate, isn&#8217;t motivated by an honest worry for a friend&#8217;s well-being, but by the simple fact that Dickie hadn&#8217;t talked to him in far too long. He hadn&#8217;t been supplying Freddie with attention. And that Freddie couldn&#8217;t abide.</p>\n<p>Hoffman fills this scene with so many infuriating and funny details, the way he judges and dismisses the room piece by piece with his eyes, manhandles the piano and bust of Hadrian, examines Dickie&#8217;s saxophone like an alien object. He picks apart the room in a child&#8217;s imitation of a detective, moving everything just enough out of place to be annoying. When Tom finally smashes Freddie&#8217;s head in with Hadrian&#8217;s, you almost understand it.</p>\n<p>There are other early roles more often associated with Hoffman&#8217;s breakout. Among them are his first two collaborations with Paul Thomas Anderson, and there are some fantastic performances from this era to be sure. There&#8217;s something, though, about his Freddie Miles that feels more three-dimensional. Something that feels more lived-in and real.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not quite his first &#8220;grown-up&#8221; role, but Hoffman&#8217;s performance grounds it in a kind of realism we hadn&#8217;t seen from him yet. His later acclaim for playing real people like Lester Bangs and Truman Capote with such dedication and attention to detail can first be seen here in <em>The Talented Mr. </em><em>Ripley</em>, playing a character not too removed from his own experiences in indulgence and privilege. It&#8217;s a great performance from a young artist who was only just beginning to show the range and skill he would use to become one of the greatest actors of his generation or any other.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/-NUxDKCX89g\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 23 Jul 2020 16:16:27 +0000","feedId":24,"bgimg":"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/philip-seymour-hoffman-talented-mr-ripley.jpg","linkMd5":"ef39655983caa84076001b6bc5c1ebe8","metaImg":"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/philip-seymour-hoffman-talented-mr-ripley.jpg","author":"M.G McIntyre","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/-NUxDKCX89g":null}}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-07-26 01:03:01","updatedTime":"2020-07-25 17:03:01","feedId":24,"fetchDate":"Sat, 25 Jul 2020 17:03:01 +0000","fetchMs":31,"handleMs":1203,"totalMs":30863,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":10,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"54.76.14.211","hostName":"europe-020.herokuapp.com","requestId":"22ffe4ec0b5846f88804e02a6367ab62_24"},"extra4":{"start":1595696580702,"total":0,"statList":[{"spend":32,"msg":"获取xml内容"},{"spend":1203,"msg":"解释文章"},{"spend":923,"msg":"上传封面图到cdn"},{"spend":6413,"msg":"修正封面图上传失败重新上传"},{"spend":19754,"msg":"正文链接上传到cdn"}]},"extra5":21,"extra6":21}
