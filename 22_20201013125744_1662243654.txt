Free usage gets you alerts, livestreaming, and two-way audio. The basic Ring Protect plan and the Protect Plus plans are essentially extra storage options for video recordings so that you can review a captured event later if you miss the alert.</p><p>The basic Ring Protect plan costs $3 a month and lets you record and share captured video from motion detection and doorbell rings for up to 60 days, and it'll store photos for seven days, from a single device.</p><p>The Ring Protect Plus plan costs $10 per month and comes with unlimited video storage for an unlimited number of Ring devices.

It can record and stream 1080p footage and comes with improved motion detection, privacy zone settings, and better night vision compared to the original first-generation Ring Video Doorbell. Being a smart doorbell, you can stream, control, and speak with visitors via the Ring app on mobile devices. You can use existing doorbell wiring if your home has it, or the Ring Video Doorbell can be powered by an on-board rechargeable battery.&#160;</p><p>As far as deals go, it's a great entry-level option that lets you test the waters of adding smart devices to your home.

Video resolution is the same at 1080p, but the video's field-of-view is slightly wider with an extra five degrees. It can connect to a 5GHz WiFi network, which is better suited for video streaming and could make for a better video stream when you watch on your mobile device. Like the standard doorbell, it can be powered by existing wiring or a rechargeable battery pack.&#160;</p><p>The 30% deal is good to have if you're after those upgrades. Otherwise, you'll be just as well off with the standard model above.&#160;</p><div id=\"ProductCard_5d2385dfa17d6c42e900add3\" style=\"position:relative; display:block; width: 100%\"><iframe src=\"https://produktor.businessinsider.com/productCardService?id=5d2385dfa17d6c42e900add3&type=medium&live=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"150%\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" style=\"position:absolute; top:0; left: 0\"></iframe></div><p>The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DM6BDA4?tag=biip_101320_amazon-prime-day-2020-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1=1&#38;psc=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Ring Video Doorbell Pro</a> is an older model, but it comes with a feature that some may find worthwhile — it can record four seconds of footage leading up to an event that triggers the motion detection to give you a better idea of what actually triggered it. It's also sleeker than the traditional Ring Doorbell design.</p><p>All this said, there are some caveats. It needs existing wiring for power, and motion detection works between 15 and 30 feet, whereas the non-Pro models detect motion between five and 30 feet.&#160;</p><p>It was $169 during Prime Day last year, and they've matched that price again in 2020.

It's designed to replace your existing peephole, and Ring says the process takes five minutes and doesn't require any drilling or wiring. It can be easily removed and taken to another apartment, too — just make sure you keep the original peephole. It does nearly everything a standard Ring Video Doorbell does, and includes 1080p video resolution, two-way voice, motion detection, and send alerts to your mobile device when someone rings.&#160;</p><p>The $70 Prime Day price for the Ring Peephole Camera is a good deal if you've been eyeing it to get the convenience and peace of mind from a smart doorbell for your apartment.</p><div id=\"ProductCard_5f8115341ad83a0fc53d9584\" style=\"position:relative; display:block; width: 100%\"><iframe src=\"https://produktor.businessinsider.com/productCardService?id=5f8115341ad83a0fc53d9584&type=medium&live=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"150%\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" style=\"position:absolute; top:0; left: 0\"></iframe></div><p>Among other uses and features, the Echo Show 5 can act as a sort of companion for the Ring Video Doorbell.

investment officer Jeff Mills told CNBC on Monday.</p><p>\"If you get a big fiscal stimulus, that is probably dollar-negative and materials have the largest foreign revenue exposure of any sector in the S&#38;P 500,\" Mills told CNBC's <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/12/stimulus-uncertainty-will-burn-sh-bryn-mawrs-jeff-mills-warns.html\">\"Trading Nation\"</a>. \"What moves materials around the country - that is the rails, so I also think transport also definitely has some room to the upside here.\"&#160;</p><p>\"We think industrials will do well in either political environment, that is how I would want to be positioned over the next 12 months,\" he added, referring to either a Democrat, or Republican, win at next month's presidential election.</p><p>He said transport firms like <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/fdx-stock\">FedEx</a> can still gain, even though the company's stock has surged more than 80% since the start of the year, supported by a boom in e-commerce and online shopping.&#160;</p><p>Mills, who oversees more than $17 billion of assets according to CNBC said: \"Be underweight the mega-cap growth trade,\" he added. \"That's overvalued, and you will see valuations come down.\"</p><p><strong data-stringify-type=\"bold\"><em data-stringify-type=\"italic\">Read More:</em></strong><em

If they do I think the rotation can happen quicker but if they don't then they have to heal on their own and I think you have this default trade back to growth like we are seeing,\" he added.&#160;</p><p>Democrats and Republicans have been at loggerheads over the size and reach of another package of measures to support the real economy since July.&#160;</p><p><strong data-stringify-type=\"bold\"><em data-stringify-type=\"italic\">Read More:</em></strong><em data-stringify-type=\"italic\">&#160;</em><em data-stringify-type=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-picks-amazon-prime-day-retail-investing-strategy-proshares-hyman-2020-10\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-picks-amazon-prime-day-retail-investing-strategy-proshares-hyman-2020-10\" data-sk=\"tooltip_parent\">The global investment strategist at a $44 billion ETF shop explains why the pandemic-fueled boom of online retail is set to accelerate — and shares 5 stocks to watch other than Amazon ahead of its Prime Day</a></em></p><p>The latest exchange of views between the two sides took place over the weekend, when President Donald Trump's team <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-congress-relief/white-house-seeks-limited-coronavirus-relief-bill-promises-further-talks-on-broader-stimulus-idUSKBN26W0QO\">proposed</a> a $1.8 trillion stimulus package over the weekend.</p><p>The measures would include a $400 boost in weekly unemployment insurance, $1,200 stimulus checks for US adults, and $1,000 checks for every child.

Target-exclusive brands also see discounts. This year's sale focuses on holiday deals and prices. The deals are available online, so shoppers won't have to brave the typical holiday shopping crowds of past years.</p><h2>When is Target Deal Days?</h2><p>This year, the event began on October 13 and runs through October 14, the same dates as <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-prime-day-best-deals\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon Prime Day 2020</a> and <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-buy-prime-day-deals-2020\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Best Buy's deal event</a>. <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/walmart-prime-day-sale-deals\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Walmart's Big Save Event</a> is also running right now, though it lasts for a longer time period from October 11 through October 15. Target has also announced season-long savings after Deal Days, starring weeklong discounts and daily digital deals beginning November 1.&#160;</p><h2>Can anyone shop Deal Days?</h2><p>Yes, the sale is available for anyone to shop online, no membership required. Discounts are available to all shoppers, though <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/target-redcard-compared-to-amazon-prime-at-whole-foods-2018-9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Target RedCard</a> holders get an extra 5% off purchases. The sale does not extend to in-store purchases.</p><h2>How do I prepare for Deal Days?</h2><p>Now that the event is live, the best way to get the best prices is to download the <a href=\"https://goto.target.com/c/196318/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fc%2Ftarget-app%2F-%2FN-4th2r\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Target App</a> and enroll in the company's free loyalty program, <a href=\"https://www.target.com/circle/dashboard\">Target Circle</a> to reap extra discounts.

Robert Jenrick, the housing minister, <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8834273/Lockdown-probably-tougher-admit-ministers-amid-SAGE-row.html\">dismissed claims</a> the measures were not \"robust\" enough but said councils should show \"leadership\" by introducing stricter measures.</p><p>\"We probably will need to go further,\" he said. \"But we want to design these steps jointly between ourselves and local government.\"</p><p>In <a

prove highly damaging to the government, the SAGE group of scientists said that the £12 billion \"test-and-trace\" programme, which Johnson has described as \"world-beating\" is having only a \"marginal\" impact on reducing the spread of the virus because it is not tracing enough people, and many of those contacted are simply ignoring advice to self-isolate.</p><p>SAGE suggested that the programme's effectiveness would likely \"further decline\" as the virus continued to spread.</p><p>\"The relatively low levels of engagement with the system... coupled with testing delays and likely poor rates of adherence with self-isolation suggests that this system is having a marginal impact on transmission at the moment,\" the scientists wrote.</p><p>\"'Unless the system grows at the same rate as the epidemic, and support is given to people to enable them to adhere to self-isolation, it is likely that the impact of Test, Trace and Isolate will further decline in the future.\"</p><div

Loop</a> keeps coffee hot for hours, as any good travel mug should. But there's one aspect in which it truly excels, and that's in ensuring your coffee stays exactly where it should — in the mug. It's leak-proof, but it's also spill-proof. Yes, those are two different things.</p><p>Where a normal travel mug lid can be left open, leading to spills from an errant elbow, the Autoseal lives up to its name by sealing itself whenever it's not being drunk from. When you're ready for a drink, you depress the button on the lid. As soon as you let go, your mug promptly seals itself.</p><p>This <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-prime-day-best-deals\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Prime Day</a>, two-packs of the useful mug are on sale for $18.99 (previously $44.99), essentially making the mugs buy-one-get-one-free. A single mug normally costs anywhere from $14 to $21 depending on the color you choose. While the two-pack colors are limited, it might be worth it to compromise for the savings.</p><p>There is one caveat to this mug. We are currently testing the newer version of this mug, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07N3C5BM8?tag=biip_101320_amazon-prime-day-2020-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1=1&#38;psc=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Contigo Luxe Autoseal</a>, and have found that the lid is prone to growing mold. The lid of the West Loop is structured a bit differently, so it may not have the same issue, but be sure to thoroughly wash your travel mug after each use and let it air dry completely.</p><div

The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YMG37J4?tag=biip_101320_amazon-prime-day-2020-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1=1&#38;psc=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Pixel 4 XL</a> started life at $900, and Amazon is selling it for $549.</p><p>Those are great deals for Google's Pixel 4 series, especially if you're looking for the best smartphone cameras. You can check out our <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/google-pixel-4-review-battery-camera-specs-design-2019-10\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pixel 4 review here</a> for more details.</p><p>I should note that Google just <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/google-pixel-5-pixel-4a-5g-price-release-date-preorder-specs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">recently announced its new Pixel 5 phone</a>, but it shouldn't really deter you from getting either of the Pixel 4 phones. The Pixel 5 comes with exactly the same camera as the Pixel 4. Most of the camera improvements Google made for the Pixel 5 are based on software, and many of them are trickling down to the Pixel 4 in a software update.&#160;</p><p>With that said, Google gave the Pixel 5 an ultrawide camera lens, whereas Google infamously snubbed that feature with the Pixel 4 series. Still, a missing ultrawide lens is certainly not a deal-breaker for these Amazon Prime Day 2020 deals on the older Pixel 4 models.</p><p>The Pixel 5 also runs on a mid-range (albeit fast) chip that won't offer much better performance, if any at all, over the chip in the Pixel 4. That's all to say that there really isn't much reason to wait for the Pixel 5, so we recommend snapping up a Pixel 4 for much less than the $700 Pixel 5 while this deal lasts.</p><div

Rather, the Bose 700 are in a newly minted \"ultra-premium\" category, while the QC35 II exist alongside them as the standard premium option. It was around the release of the Bose 700 in 2019 that the company reduced the retail price of the QC35 II from $350 to $300, and now they are even cheaper for Prime Day.</p><div id=\"ProductCard_5d236c62a17d6c48f04e3525\" style=\"position:relative; display:block; width: 100%\"><iframe src=\"https://produktor.businessinsider.com/productCardService?id=5d236c62a17d6c48f04e3525&type=medium&live=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"150%\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" style=\"position:absolute; top:0; left: 0\"></iframe></div><h2>Bose's QC35 IIs are still excellent headphones — especially for this deal price</h2><p>The Bose QC series has been mostly unrivalled since it was first released, and it's usually the first set of headphones people think of when they're looking for noise-cancelling tech and great audio quality.</p><p>With the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0756GB78C?tag=biip_101320_amazon-prime-day-2020-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1=1&#38;psc=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">QC35 II</a> headphones, you're getting deep, rich sound with a healthy dose of bass and balance of mids and highs. They're also incredibly comfortable headphones with plush and soft ear pads and plenty of room for your ears. Their noise cancelling is top-notch and only bested by Bose's own 700 headphones, and perhaps Sony's most recent $350 WH-1000XM4 headphones. And as for battery life, Bose's 20-hour claim seems pretty spot-on.&#160;</p><p>You can check out the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/bose-700-wireless-noise-cancelling-headphones-review-nearly-perfect-2019-7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bose 700 review here</a>&#160;and the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/sony-wh-1000xm4-wireless-noise-cancelling-headphones-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sony WH-1000XM4 review here</a>.</p><p>While the QC35 II are excellent, they're not entirely perfect. For one, I expected better build quality for a pair of headphones that used to cost $350. It's not bad, but they're made of light and hollow plastic that can easily scuff over time. But that's inconsequential to their primary function of being comfortable wireless noise-cancelling headphones.&#160;</p><p>Something else to note is that the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0756GB78C?tag=biip_101320_amazon-prime-day-2020-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1=1&#38;psc=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">QC35 II</a> use the old microUSB standard for charging. It's only an issue if you've been ditching microUSB by upgrading your devices and accessories to those that use the newer USB-C standard. It might simply mean that you have to bring along a microUSB cable alongside USB-C cables.&#160;</p><p>There's no such thing as the perfect device, and this discount more than makes up for any complaints.&#160;</p><h2>For more headphone and speaker recommendations, check out our various buying guides:</h2><ul><li><strong><a
