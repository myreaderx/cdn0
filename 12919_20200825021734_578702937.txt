So we built it ourselves.</p> \n   <p>Using machine learning operating on a large corpus of English text<sup id=\"fnref-6526-1\"><a href=\"https://ia.net/?post_type=ia5_writer_posts&amp;p=6526#fn-6526-1\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1</a></sup>, we trained the app to be able to identify parts of speech and then highlight them appropriately.

There are rough edges.

There is a new font. It’s another Quattro, from the hands of a bloody amateur. Amateur means lover. Be nice to people in love. Yes, it has ink traps, and yes, it comes in different grades and has all sorts of specials like a ligature for the iA logo.</p> \n   <p>We rethought how articles work on large screens. We get an atypical amount of traffic with large screens. So we asked ourselves: How can we use the space better than just making the font bigger and we came up with this crazy layout:</p> \n  </div> \n </div> \n</section> \n<div class=\"article__img\"> \n <img src=\"https://ia.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/iA.net-New-Layout-1024x214.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-41\" /> \n <figcaption>\n   See, this is what you’d see if you used a desktop or a laptop or a tablet to look at the site.

Say again, links? Yes, we figure that it would be nice to show where a link points to so you don’t have to hover.</p> \n   <p>Therefore, we treat links like footnotes. Or better: Sidenotes. There is room for improvement on mobile, but for now we put the footnotes reference on the bottom and scroll you right there.</p> \n   <p>We are proud of the headings on the left. They allow you to read the whole body text in one go without disruption. They allow you to quickly scan long articles and pick out the chapters you want to read.

What we did there<sup id=\"fnref-5512-5\"><a href=\"https://ia.net/?p=5512#fn-5512-5\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">5</a></sup>, is unique. We used CSS to show screen shots.

With this, we do one screenshot in HTML, translate it in 10 languages, done! If we had to do screenshots, we’d have to do 10 (languages) x 5 (platforms) x 3 (states) x number of screens. Hundreds of screenshots. As of now, we have not yet done all the screenshots with all the variations. We are working on it.</p> \n   <p><img src=\"https://ia.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/iA.Net-Day-and-Night-New-Design.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"708\" height=\"689\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6474\" /></p> \n   <p>Beta testers wondered “why is the light iA all night now?” It isn’t.

Version 1.2 of iA Writer for Windows has launched. This release packs in a boatload of improvements, making it the biggest update to hit the platform since the initial release.</p> \n<h2>New Preview Engine, Unified Templates</h2> \n<p>You sent us a lot of requests to improve Preview, Templates, and Export. Most issues you encountered had to do with the unfortunate requirement to support old versions of Windows. iA Writer for Windows had to use IE9 as the web rendering engine—not the greatest of all browsers. Templates that were worked on, painstakingly, didn’t give you the results seen on Mac and iOS. So we went full speed ahead with a modern browser engine — Chromium.</p> \n<p>Your HTML-Preview is now combined in the same window as the Editor, just like on Mac. It renders the templates beautifully, just like on Mac. All templates use a standard format, you guessed it… just like on Mac.</p> \n<p>The export of PDFs takes advantage of this modern rendering and now supports headers, footers, page size and other properties that can be configured within the standard iA templates.</p> \n<h2>WHOA: Paginated PDF Preview!</h2> \n<p>A brand new paginated PDF Preview option makes its debut in version 1.2. Flick a switch in the menu bar and you’ll see a PDF of your current document rendered right in the Preview area. <em>This lets you see exactly where page breaks will occur before printing or exporting to a PDF file!</em> PDF Preview had an eye-opening effect on us and the tester group: “I understand the benefit of Markdown much better now that I see that markdown allows me to edit the source while the final printed result id displayed on the right.” It is likely coming very very soon to iOS and macOS. </p> \n<p><img src=\"http://ia.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ia-pdf-preview.gif\" alt=\"PDF Preview in iA Writer\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5207\" /></p> \n<p></p> \n<p>PDF preview consumes a lot of resources, so please be patient with it, especially if you use it with very large documents. You’ll love the big strides made in Preview here. Now, bear with us; it gets even better. Version 1.2 is packed with quality of life improvements in every area of the app:</p> \n<h2>New Typography Options</h2> \n<p>You now have Mono and Quattro available as font choices in the Editor in addition to the current Duospace. Since Mono was added, tables always use it in the Editor so they stay nicely aligned. Btw, did you know that on Windows you can auto-align tables?</p> \n<p><img src=\"http://ia.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/markdown-table-alignment.gif\" alt=\"markdown automatic table alignment\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5245\" /></p> \n<p>You didn’t know that? There are more Jedi tricks hidden under iA Writer’s hood. We should inform you better and we will.</p> \n<h2>New Preferences Panel</h2> \n<p>Again mirroring the experience on Mac, iA Writer for Windows now includes a Preferences panel. While many of these options were pulled from menus and assembled in one place for ease of use, there are plenty of new members. For example, we added our own version of <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/projects/smartypants/\">SmartyPants</a> in this update, so you can choose what type of quotation marks should replace straight quotes when you render text.</p> \n<p><img src=\"http://ia.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/preferences2.gif\" alt=\"Preferences in iA Writer\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5216\" /></p> \n<h2>Devils and Details</h2> \n<ul> \n <li>You get proper touch support for scrolling and selection.

It is a big, big update and you’ll want to install it. If you already have iA Writer for Windows you can just relaunch the app and it will inform you the update is available and it will guide you through the install. If you don’t have iA Writer for Windows already, what are you waiting for? You can get the free trial which includes all the new features from 1.2 <a href=\"http://ia.net/writer/windows/trial/download\">right here</a>.</p> \n<h2>Hey! What about feature parity?</h2> \n<p>Of course, we’d like to give the best to every platform and we are constantly considering the effort of aligning them as close as possible. And if we had 100 employees and 100 Million Dollars to spend, we’d be 100% feature par. But we are not Microsoft, we are not Apple, we are not Amazon and we are not Google. But we believe that being on all major platforms is key for a text editor and we are giving all we can to make you happy.</p> \n<p>What we <em>are</em>, is independent, small and hungry, and we are eager to explore the boundaries of text editing. We are a curiosity-driven operation. Feature parity is on our horizon, but we want to drive our products forward with the resources we have, push the envelope where we can, and learn along the way. What’s the problem with feature parity?</p> \n<p>Different platforms support different features, and rather than being on par everywhere and cutting back features everywhere, we explore new options on different platforms. Those who work, we port to other platforms. Sometimes, the tiniest (and often essential) feature requires weeks of work on a different platform. Until recently, it was practically impossible to have a custom line-height on Android without rewriting core elements of Android (now it’s finally possible, so the next big update will have a decent line-height). The new Android version is coming as well, very soon. Android comes with much less power under the hood than Mac, iOS, and Windows, so feature parity is way harder to achieve. But we do what we can to make all of you happy.</p> \n<p>Currently, Windows has Text Folding, Menu Outline, PDF Preview, Table Alignment, but no Syntax Highlight. Mac and iOS have Syntax Highlight, but no Folding, Menu Outline, and PDF Preview. We have been working on Syntax Highlight for Windows. But unlike on macOS and iOS, where it comes with the Operating System, on Windows, it requires some heavy AI lifting. Same for Spelling and Grammar (it doesn’t come bundled with the OS on Windows).</p> \n<p>From the feedback we have gotten from testers, we already know that you want PDF Preview for Mac and iOS. We’re working on it. Menu Outline on Mac and iOS is planned as well. This will take a bit longer, but it is coming. We are 9 years in, now and it still feels like we are just about to get started.</p> \n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ia.net/writer/blog/pdf-preview-new-typography-preferences\">PDF Preview, New Typography, Preferences</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ia.net\">iA</a>.</p> \n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/InformationArchitectsJapan/~4/Vzp-wtbBLxM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 20 Nov 2019 07:18:38 +0000","feedId":12919,"bgimg":"http://ia.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ia-pdf-preview.gif","linkMd5":"1466540463db6c95a9d38b24f277da3f","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn68@2020_5/2020/08/25/02-15-48-605_7928140981e30ac6.webp","destWidth":1073,"destHeight":691,"sourceBytes":2072132,"destBytes":1536276,"author":"@iawriter","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://ia.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ia-pdf-preview.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn68@2020_5/2020/08/25/02-15-48-605_7928140981e30ac6.webp","http://ia.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/markdown-table-alignment.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn91@2020_2/2020/08/25/02-17-22-848_b88f35b8176bbe90.webp","http://ia.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/preferences2.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn60@2020_4/2020/08/25/02-17-14-983_d256d755a62bc95c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/InformationArchitectsJapan/~4/Vzp-wtbBLxM":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn51@2020_2/2020/08/25/02-17-04-847_850270dfc8c1eadf.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598321741358},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 10:15:41","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 10:15:41","title":"Introducing Style Check","link":"https://ia.net/?post_type=ia5_writer_posts&p=6612","description":"<p>Style Check is like having a personal editor-in-chief on your device, carefully reviewing your text for redundancies, clichés and filler words as you type. It’s simple, different, and powerful.</p> \n<div class=\"article__img\"> \n <img src=\"https://ia.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/iA-Writer-Style-Check-with-Dieter-Rams-Before-and-After.png\" alt=\"iA Writer Style Check - Before and After\" width=\"1024\" height=\"646\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-6613\" /> \n <figcaption>\n   Left: Dieter Rams 10 Principles of Design without Style Check. Right: After Style check. Obviously, that’s a trick. Dieter Rams doesn’t need Style Check. His original text was the one on the right, free of superfluous words. \n </figcaption> \n</div> \n<section class=\"article__box\"> \n <div class=\"article__box-heading\"> \n  <div> \n   <h2>About Style Check</h2> \n  </div> \n </div> \n <div class=\"article__box-text\"> \n  <div> \n   <p>Unlike your high-school language teacher, Style Check doesn’t tell you what is right. It grays out superfluous words and strikes them through hypothetically, so you can see how your text will flow with them removed. A double tap/click on a struck through word or phrase will select it for easy removal. It’s up to you which ones you remove and which ones you keep.</p> \n   <p>Sometimes you need fillers for rhythm, sometimes because you like them, and sometimes you <em>really</em> need them. Style check doesn’t want to delete everything it highlights. It wants to make you think and reconsider if what you said is what you meant.</p> \n   <p>Crucially, no deletions occur unless you choose to do them. Nothing is ever automatically removed and no content is sent to an internet service for review. Style Check is designed to keep your texts private. All processing is done directly on your devices.</p> \n   <p>Being clear, concise and reducing things to their essence are core principles at iA. Our apps are built with these ideas in mind. It happens that good writing follows the same principles. Cut the fat. Remove the fluff. Style Check improves your text by distilling it into a concentrated, more potent form. We’ve been using Style Check internally for the last couple of months and it has exceeded our expectations.</p> \n   <p>It’s not like any of the existing grammar checkers or functions. There is no AI, it is not smarter than you, and it doesn’t steal your texts. It makes you think about what you say. And yet it can improve your writing instantaneously. Let’s take a closer look at the individual categories of Style Check.</p> \n  </div> \n </div> \n</section> \n<section class=\"article__box\"> \n <div class=\"article__box-heading\"> \n  <div> \n   <h3>Fillers</h3> \n  </div> \n </div> \n <div class=\"article__box-text\"> \n  <div> \n   <p>These are words that don’t add any meaning to the surrounding text. They are usually unnecessary and should be removed. There are times you may want to keep one or two around, but you want a good reason to do so.

This is good advice. Style Check will seek these out and you can swap them out for something more original and inspired. Examples:</p> \n   <ul> \n    <li><del style=\"color: gray\">against all odds</del></li> \n    <li><del style=\"color: gray\">brass tacks</del></li> \n    <li><del style=\"color: gray\">long and short of it</del></li> \n   </ul> \n  </div> \n </div> \n</section> \n<section class=\"article__box\"> \n <div class=\"article__box-heading\"> \n  <div> \n   <h2>How to use it</h2> \n  </div> \n </div> \n <div class=\"article__box-text\"> \n  <div> \n   <p>Style Check is found in the Focus menu on Mac and the aA button on iOS. Checking for redundancies, clichés and fillers can be toggled independently from this menu, in the same way as choosing parts of speech for Syntax Control. If you have other patterns you wish to avoid in your writing you can add these to the Custom section. Style Check will strike them out when it comes across them.</p> \n   <p>iA Writer 5.6 offers Style Check for English, German and French. We’ll be bringing support for more languages soon.

Amazon uses the sales data of its resellers to continuously expand and solidify market dominance. Facebook copies the competitors that they can’t bully into being bought to keep their dominant market position. Apple is partying in antitrust land forcing its competitors to hand out 30% of its revenue. And they are lying about the undeniable: That they run monopolies. The game is rigged. And no one is enforcing the rules. Except for Epic, the maker of one of the most successful games of all time, that has the goal to kill all others and be to the sole survivor.</p> \n<p>There shouldn’t be a debate about whether these companies run monopolies. It doesn’t make sense to speculate about what they might be willing to do about their market segment dominance. All they are willing to do is defend, solidify, expand it. And we shouldn’t debate whether monopolies are good or bad. If you have ever played Monopoly you know that the game is over once a player has reached total dominance. You don’t need to play it to the last bankruptcy. It’s the same in real life. Total dominance is boring and depressing.</p> \n<h2>Facebook</h2> \n<p>A company with a Wikipedia page that has more information about scandals and controversies than positive or neutral facts. It makes $70 Billion with 2.5 Billion users systematically abusing their privacy, accelerating conspiracy theories, periodically leaking and losing sensitive user data, lying to and intimidating the press, constantly scheming, misleading us without end and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/29/in-antitrust-hearing-zuckerberg-admits-facebook-has-copied-its-competition/\">buying every entity that threatens their monopoly on social networks</a>. No matter how much you want to avoid Facebook there is no path around them.

Microsoft is attempting to buy TikTok, the only major social network that is not owned by Facebook (of which they also own a stake). The current US president is threatening to shut the service down if it doesn’t get sold to an American company. He is so blatant about it that he wants Microsoft to pay the US a share if the deal goes through. It would be funny if it weren’t true. Clearly, Microsoft doesn’t need to own more than it already owns.

If you manage to have the nerve to read the list, you’ll be even more stunned.</p> \n<h2>Apple</h2> \n<p>Apple, a company with California Hippie roots that encourages to think different, has a developer community that is afraid to speak their mind in public. Apple is great and different in many ways, like in design, in UI consistency, in marketing, and in pioneering privacy as a blue-chip, but when it comes to having a monopoly it’s the same. It exercises total dominance over its iOS platform. And while they only reach 13% of the mobile phone market, these 13% make up for two-thirds of mobile app store sales. Their antitrust case looks like this: Apple takes 30% of its direct competitors’ revenue and keeps them from growing into serious threats.</p> \n<p><small><strong>Acquisitions:</strong> Network Innovations, Orion Network Systems, Styleware, Nashoba Systems, Coral Software, NeXT, Power Computing Corporation, Xemplar Education, Raycer Graphics, NetSelector, Astarte-DVD Authoring Software, SoundJam MP, Bluefish Labs, bluebuzz, Spruce Technologies, PowerSchool, Nothing Real, Zayante, Silicon Grail Corp-Chalice, Propel Software, Prismo Graphics, Emagic, SchemaSoft, FingerWorks, Silicon Color, Proximity, P.A.

Mergers and acquisitions to expand market dominance and reach monopoly is not Apple’s main strategy.</p> \n<h3>30% and 13%</h3> \n<p>So, what is the problem exactly with the 30%? And, how can Apple have a Monopoly with only 13% market share compared to Android?</p> \n<h4>What is wrong with 30% revenue share?</h4> \n<p>30% is typically what a successful company makes in profit. 30% is a ridiculously high margin for software retail. And Apple knows that:</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p> I think we’re realizing that 30 percent is way too much,” said Phillip Shoemaker, a former senior App Store executive, who left Apple in 2016. Credit card companies charge roughly 3 percent to process payments. “It should be closer to that,” he said. –<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/14/technology/apple-app-store-epic-games-fortnite.html\">New York Times</a> </p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>All things taken into account, R&amp;D, components, retail, management, and marketing, Apple probably makes more than 30% on its iPhone business. And they better do. Without profit, you cannot run a business. There will always be bad times where you need reserves. And, without at least 15% profit you cannot grow a business. It doesn’t take an MBA from Harvard to figure that out.</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p> There are very few companies out there that have a 30 percent profit margin,” said Andy Yen, the chief executive of ProtonMail, an email service. –<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/14/technology/apple-app-store-epic-games-fortnite.html\">New York Times</a> </p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>Small indie companies hardly making a profit is not what the antitrust case is about. It’s not about companies like iA, offering niche markdown productivity apps. Apart from Microsoft Office, no one makes big money with productivity software.</p> \n<p>The big case is where the big money flows. And the big money is in big games, big movies, and big music apps. Apple takes 30% from its direct competitors Spotify, Netflix, and Epic, while running Apple Music, Apple TV, and Apple Arcade. Apple eats their profit margin, and it gains data insight into its main competitors. Apple sees all your data. If this is not a clear cut antitrust case, what is?</p> \n<h4>“But, but, but…”</h4> \n<p>Or, wait, is it not? Here is what consumers, who don’t care much about who gets their money, sometimes say:</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p> It’s their platform, so they can do what they want. They bring a lot of users to you! They handle sales. And, if you don’t like it, sell stuff on Android! Ha, gotcha! Google Play also takes 30%! </p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>First, you don’t know how it is, if you don’t sell apps on the App Store. People selling apps on the App Store, deal with Apple business, design, technology, and politics every day. Second, Apple, Facebook, Google, or Microsoft doesn’t need you to defend them, they have complete control over their market segment. And, third, let’s look and kill those boring arguments, once for all, one by one…</p> \n<h4>“13% Marketshare is not a Monopoly!”</h4> \n<p>Here is the problem with the 13% market share argument: Apple makes double the revenue with a fragment of Google’s customer base! In other words, Apple managed to get everyone that is willing to spend money to use their phone. With only a 13% market share Apple’s App Store gets double the app sale revenue:</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p> iOS App Store 2018 revenue came to $46.6 billion, while Google Play revenue stood at $24.8 billion by this measure –<a href=\"https://www.businessofapps.com/data/app-revenues/\">Business of Apps</a> </p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>Either the stats are messed up, or Apple’s customer base is so exceptional in being open to spending that an Apple user is indeed 12 times more likely to spend money on digital goods. Not twice, not 5 times, 12 times!</p> \n<p>Running both an iOS and an Android app, we know that the stats are right. Android users do not want to spend money. If you offer your app for 5 Dollars per year you get called a megalomanic. This is why <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2020/06/08/apple-could-cost-google-15-billion-by-buying-duckduckgo-analyst-says/\">Google hands out more than 7 Billion Dollars per year just to be the default search on iPhone</a>. Android users don’t spend money on apps. Not spending money is the Android brand. Android is not an alternative, it’s an alternate reality.</p> \n<h4>“Google Play also takes 30%!”</h4> \n<p>But Google Play takes 30%… Yes, it does take 30%, but if you don’t like that you are allowed to offer to install your app outside Google Play. And that changes everything because you are not <em>forced</em> to use the App Store. On iOS, there is no other way. The reason why apparently is security. Security is important. But both you and I know that in this context this is an excuse.</p> \n<h4>Taking 30% from your competitors</h4> \n<p>Apple claims that they don’t do special deals with the big ones. They “treat everyone equally.” First of all, this is not true. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348108/apple-amazon-prime-video-app-store-special-treatment-fee-subscriptions\">Amazon got a special deal</a>, AirBnB got special treatment, Uber and Lyft don’t pay 30% even though their businesses depend on apps.</p> \n<p>Apple is not treating Netflix, Nintendo, and Spotify like iA Writer to be fair with us small devs. Think about it. Apple doesn’t profit much from taking 30% of iA Writer’s sales. It would cost them a smile to cut us off. And, given that from the hundreds of thousands of app, only very few reach our position, it wouldn’t be a big deal to cut us all loose. The benefit of having small passionate devs is not in the money they make from them. The benefit of having us is that we enrich the platform. For years, people have been telling us that they buy Apple gear because of iA Writer and similar apps. The benefit of cutting 30% from the small ones is that they can say “we treat everyone the same” and cut off a major chunk of the big Netflix, Spotify, and Fortnite cakes.</p> \n<h4>How do consumers suffer?</h4> \n<p>Consumers suffer when developers can’t grow. Building an App business on the App Store is not impossible. The idea that all you need is a great idea and, learn to code and then live from it is a complete fairy tale. You need to run a tight ship and your profit margin will always be close to zero. Unless you switch to a subscription model. And, man do customers hate that model!</p> \n<p>Two years ago, Apple cut that 30% in half for apps that offer subscriptions for more than one year. They are more likely to promote apps that offer subscriptions. They love subscriptions so much. And sure as hell, a lot of developers followed suit and changed from paid to subscriptions. In spite of everyone-and-their-dog hating to have to pay yet another subscription besides cellphone, electricity, and the rent for their apartment. And sure as hell every developer <a href=\"https://ia.net/topics/subscription-or-no-subscription\">changing the business model to please Apple</a> had to face a gigantic shit storm and continues to face a never-ending torrent of complaints from their users. And sure as hell they all now claim that they are doing great with subscriptions. Hell, they say that there is no other way to run an app sustainably than through subscriptions. What a load of crap! It <em>is</em> possible to make a living from selling software. It’s just harder when someone takes your profit month by month than when they take half of it.</p> \n<p>What about Apple bringing in users? It’s hard to tell. Yes, they bring in users. Analytics tell us we get Millions of page views. But the Analytics we get, claims we hardly make any sales through our site with our hundreds of thousands of page views per month, sending over practically all of our traffic. They claim that when we get a big marketing push nothing changes. Apple’s Analytics claim that only App Store ad words and Apple’s featurings influence sales. You get it. Either Apple loves you, or you pay even more to get exposure. This is not great. And over the years it keeps getting worse. We have practically no control over how to push our sales. And it keeps getting worse. And there is nothing we can do.</p> \n<p>There is one thing more depressing than the described monopolistic superpower of Apple, Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Microsoft. The super smarty pants who have no experience selling software on the App Store who to defend these giants with the ever same boring and depressing arguments. “It’s capitalism,” or “Supermarkets take a cut, too,” or “first world problems!”. You are entitled to your opinions, but if you have no experience lecturing people that have worked in the industry for over ten years and managed to be one of the few among Millions to be profitable in this tough environment, your opinions are about as important as your butterfly technique to Michael Phelps. “But Tim Cook said so, too!”</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p> Apple argues that it has actually cut software developers a break. Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, suggested to Congress last month that when software was still sold in brick-and-mortar stores, 50 percent to 70 percent of the retail price went to middlemen. –<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/14/technology/apple-app-store-epic-games-fortnite.html\">New York Times</a> </p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>That’s a good one. Are you old enough to remember how much software cost back then? Handing out 1,500 Dollars for Microsoft Office?</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p> Suites, in particular, were more expensive but offered significant value by bundling popular applications that would cost upwards of $1,500 if bought separately versus $600 for the entire suite. […] Now you can install Office on up to 5 computers for just $10 per month. Office 2000 Premium at one point cost $800, and this was just a single license. <a href=\"https://www.groovypost.com/unplugged/23-years-microsoft-office/\">A Look at 25 years of Microsoft Office</a> </p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>Buying a copy of QuarkXpress (with dongle!) was a big moment, Adobe’s products were as expensive as second-hand cars. Ah, those were the times… But now back to 2020, where you can play Fortnite for free forever.</p> \n<h2>Enter Epic</h2> \n<p>Finally, someone with power dares to stand up to Apple. Not the government. The American government is a farce. The EU does what it can, but it’s big, complex, and slow.</p> \n<p>This week, Epic, maker of the Battle Royale game Fortnite, submitted an update to the App Store that featured a clear provocation: “Pay via App Store or pay less to us directly.” They got <a href=\"https://nerdist.com/article/fortnite-epic-games-apple-lawsuit-battle-whats-happening/\">banned both on the App Store and on Google Play</a>. Then Epic has <a href=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/apple-complaint-734589783.pdf\">filed legal papers</a> against Apple. Apple’s response:</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p> Epic enabled a feature in its app which was not reviewed or approved by Apple, and they did so with the express intent of violating the App Store guidelines … We will make every effort to work with Epic to resolve these violations so they can return Fortnite to the App Store.” <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/13/technology/apple-fortnite-ban.html#click=https://t.co/DHHcngaD7v\">Fortnite Creator Sues Apple and Google After Ban From App Stores</a> </p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>Fortnite can afford to go heads on with Apple because it doesn’t depend on Apple. Its core user base of 350,000 players uses PCs and PlayStations. Epic is one of the few digital giants that doesn’t depend on Apple or Google. Fortnite hardly runs on Macs, unless you have a new pro model. It is not that much fun on mobile devices. The power Fortnite wields through its online community is nothing short of epic. If you have kids between 10 and 20, you may be scared of how addictive Fortnite is. You will have no doubt that among younger people it is a major power.</p> \n<p>When I came home from after work last night, my 11-year-old son explained in detail to me what happened between Apple and Fortnite. He even knew what ad the Nineteen Eighty Fortnite ad was referencing an old Apple ad and could explain the backstory (“there was another old company that made all PCs and Apple wanted to make sure that other company didn’t own all computers…”), and he told me that Spotify was siding with Fortnite.</p> \n<p>Financially, Netflix and Spotify have a stronger case to rebel against Apple. And the core audience of Netflix and Spotify is closer to the Apple brand.</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p> Netflix grossed $853 million in 2018 on the iOS App Store. Based on that figure, Apple’s take would have been around $256 million, the firm said. –<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/31/netflix-stops-paying-the-apple-tax-on-its-853m-in-annual-ios-revenue/\">TechCrunch</a> </p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>At the same time, Netflix and Spotify are more dependent on Apple than Epic. Going down Epic’s route would have more of an impact, but they cannot afford to be banned from the most lucrative platform in the world for a couple of months. But imagine what would happen if Netflix and Spotify joined Epic? It could start a wave, a strike, and, you know what, We’d be game! 30% share is <em>too</em> much. 30% is what a run operation makes in profit. It’s higher than the highest tier in corporate tax. every developer we talk to and Business analysts around the world say 30% revenue share comes from a dark fairytale. What would be a fair share? 5% would be a fair share. Is there hope?</p> \n<p>As mentioned, governments are slow and politics is a complicated game. But fast companies like Epic can move quickly and in a coordinated way. Epic’s move was prepared. Unlike Netflix or Spotify can economically afford to take on Apple because it is not <em>that</em> important for them. They came to the fight prepared with this video:</p> \n<p><object data=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/euiSHuaw6Q4?autoplay=1\" width=\"100%\" height=\"500px\"></object></p> \n<p>If you know Apple’s original video you know how much this hurts. And if you know Fortnite you know that they put this video on the most powerful PR platform around. No, not YouTube or Facebook, they stream it on Fortnite. It will be interesting the see what PR effect this will have. Likely, Fortnite will get even more exposure and earn sympathy points from the Anti-Apple base using PCs and Android devices. Android users are able to play Fortnite as they can install the game from Epic directly instead of going through the Google Play Store. Getting Android users to install it directly is, in Fortnite terminology, an epic win for them. Converting all the players that had a Google Play account to buy from them directly will free them of the 30% ball and chain.</p> \n<p>Epic is one of the smartest gaming companies around. Their design, marketing tactics, business strategy, and reach are beyond anything a gaming company has reached in the last 20 years. Fortnite has fought a similar fight against Steam, which they abandoned because Steam demanded too high a percentage. They left and never came back. This happened at a time where Fortnite wasn’t even close to the size it has today.</p> \n<p>Of course, Epic is not an immaculate saint. Fortnite is not the hero, it’s the heroin of games. It frightens parents, especially those who are addicted to Fortnite themselves, to death. Fortnite has an appetite for time that would devour years of childhoods if not stopped. Epic doesn’t want a reduction to 5%, it wants to pay nothing and run its own store on iOS. Which, let’s be real, has to be a negotiation tactic. On its own store, Epic charges 12% to developers. As some will point out, Sony demands a similar share and it’s not entirely clear if one can get around it. And, to make your head spin a bit more with corporate ping-pong: Let’s not leave out that <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/9/21318978/sony-epic-games-fortnite-investment-250-million-game-development\">Sony has a stake in Epic Games</a>.</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p> Sony has made a $250 million investment in Epic Games, the two companies announced on Thursday. The deal means Sony gets a 1.4 percent interest in the game development studio and publisher and gives Epic a valuation of $17.86 billion, reports VentureBeat. </p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>You may also want to know that Epic has been fighting against bad PR that tried to frame Fortnite as “dying”. Google it and you find a waterfall of articles with that title. Going heads on against one of the most powerful companies in the world will strengthen their image as fighters. And what positions a fighter better than a big fight? Pointing out Epics hypocrisy doesn’t devalue the core argument that <em>30% revenue share is just too high</em>.</p> \n<p>To be perfectly clear: The argument is <em>not</em> “are you for Epic or Apple?”. Both are big corporations with shareholders, political influence, self-interests, PR agencies, hypocrisies, and economic fears, striving for more and more power. What we are saying: “In our industry, taking 30% from your revenue, prevents developers from running a sustainable business”.</p> \n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ia.net/topics/monopolies-apple-and-epic\">On Monopolies, Apple, and Epic</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ia.net\">iA</a>.</p> \n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/InformationArchitectsJapan/~4/WG2qLo9c5cs\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 15 Aug 2020 15:32:40 +0000","feedId":12919,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"07d0ddabd30b01900b6e0bcb590f58fc","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Oliver Reichenstein","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/InformationArchitectsJapan/~4/WG2qLo9c5cs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn100@2020_2/2020/08/25/02-17-04-833_fc934da4d1381202.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598321741359},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 10:15:41","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 10:15:41","title":"How to Think Different","link":"https://ia.net/?p=6875","description":"<p>This week we published two long posts on Monopolies, the Apple Tax, and Subscriptions. Both articles come to the conclusion that lowering the 30% fee Apple charges developers would benefit everyone. The tax is at the core of their Antitrust case, at the core of the developer’s business model. And in the end, it is in our common customer’s interest to lower it, because profitable development produces better software.</p> \n<p>The reaction to our take on <a href=\"https://ia.net/topics/monopolies-apple-and-epic\">the Apple Tax</a> and <a href=\"https://ia.net/topics/subscription-or-no-subscription\">subscriptions</a> has warmed our hearts. Our inbox fills with happy nods, job applications, and thoughtful suggestions on how to improve our posts. Check Twitter search to get a glimpse into our inbox and DMs. Without any “call to action”, those articles even moved the notoriously Stoic sales needle in the App Store.</p> \n<p>The counter position to lowering the 30% simply demands submission. It tells us to shut up, accept things as they are, and follow the orders. It’s cynical. Apple itself is a shining example to <em>not</em> accept things as they are, to <em>not</em> giving into fear and submission, and how to put a “little dent in the universe.”</p> \n<p>Think about it. Today, developers are scared to speak. That can not be good. Are scared people the ones they want to work with? Fear is not good for Apple, and, ultimately, our fear to do and say what we think can not be good for their customers either. We don’t blame those who stay silent. You have to be hungry and foolish to bite the hand that feeds you.</p> \n<p>Here is how we see it: Dealing with executives for 20 years through the agency, we have learned one thing: <strong>Decision-makers are surrounded by scared careerists who say what the executive wants to hear. The more power you have the more precious are people that tell you what they think.</strong> Courage is precious. Respect is not earned by doing what you are told to do. It’s mutual. Think about this if you are scared of speaking up. People in power do not respect you if you speak after their mouths. You are not independent if you are scared to say what you experience and think.</p> \n<p><strong>The courage to think for yourself comes from the intuition, that you cannot succeed if you don’t <em>dare</em> to think for yourself.</strong> The big secret is that those who succeed know and respect those who think differently, and that being scared of speaking your mind when it’s risky—when it matters most—, is why you fail. Kafka described beautifully how you fail if you don’t have the courage to move forward on what you think matters:</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p> ‘…how is that in these many years no one except me has requested entry?’ The gatekeeper sees that the man is already dying and, in order to reach his diminishing sense of hearing, he shouts at him, ‘Here no one else can gain entry, since this entrance was assigned only to you. I’m going now to close it.'” </p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>No matter how cynical this world will make you… When it comes to design, privacy, consistency, and forward-thinking, Apple <em>is</em> thinking different. At the same time, there <em>is</em> a risk we take by speaking up. We bet that, in spite of being a two Trillion dollar company, the executive branch of Apple respects <em>others</em> who think different. Times change, App Stores change, and Apple, like you and me, is far from perfect. But how can you improve if everyone around you is too scared to talk to you?</p> \n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ia.net/topics/how-to-think-different\">How to Think Different</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ia.net\">iA</a>.</p> \n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/InformationArchitectsJapan/~4/b1vD-KRJbUk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 21 Aug 2020 12:27:54 +0000","feedId":12919,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"b1461cc035de1ca15f4d769e7ebb2b66","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Oliver Reichenstein","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/InformationArchitectsJapan/~4/b1vD-KRJbUk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn44@2020_1/2020/08/25/02-17-04-725_1c320442937eaa3c.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598321741358},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 10:15:41","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 10:15:41","title":"New PDF Preview, Better Web Publishing, Improved Editing","link":"https://ia.net/?post_type=ia5_writer_posts&p=5307","description":"<p><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/417970878\" width=\"100%\" height=\"720\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p> \n<p><b>iA Writer 5.5 for Mac and iOS has arrived. The update adds a powerful mix of functionality and delicate subtlety that will improve your writing workflow.</b></p> \n<h2>PDF Preview</h2> \n<p>When you open the Preview you can choose between <code>Web</code> and <code>PDF</code> modes. On Mac this can be toggled in the bottom toolbar. On iOS you can tap the template button in the nav bar to bring up the selector.</p> \n<p><img src=\"http://ia.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/PDF_and_stats.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5308\" /></p> \n<blockquote>\n <p> But why do I need a PDF Preview? Isn’t the Web Preview good enough? </p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>Web Preview will make you happy if your everyday workflow involves, well, the web. If you’re making a PDF—or printing on paper—then having the PDF Preview is a blessing. It shows each full page of the document, complete with headers, footers and the location of each page break. Now you’ll see, before printing or exporting, exactly how the text will look on the page. Did we mention PDF Preview automatically refreshes and scrolls in sync with the Editor, just like Web Preview?</p> \n<p><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/417973973\" width=\"100%\" height=\"720\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p> \n<p>What if you never print anything and instead publish most of your writing online? We have good news for you, too…</p> \n<h2>Online Publishing Improvements</h2> \n<p>iA Writer 5.5 adds a turbocharge to how and where you can publish on the web.</p> \n<p>For starters, we added Micropub support. This means you can publish to Micro.blog and other IndieWeb tools. Now the IndieAuth system can be used elsewhere too: If you run a self-hosted WordPress.org site, you can publish straight to it using the slim IndieAuth plugin instead of the Swiss-Army-Knife that is JetPack.</p> \n<p>We took the opportunity to improve account management for each service. You can use multiple accounts for each of WordPress, Medium, Ghost and Micropub. And since having three <code>WordPress</code> and two <code>Micropub</code> entries in the account listing isn’t very useful, you can reorder and rename each of these accounts in the UI:</p> \n<p><img src=\"http://ia.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/OnlinePublishing.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5346\" srcset=\"https://ia.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/OnlinePublishing.png 1590w, https://ia.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/OnlinePublishing-300x211.png 300w, https://ia.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/OnlinePublishing-768x539.png 768w, https://ia.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/OnlinePublishing-1024x719.png 1024w, https://ia.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/OnlinePublishing-513x360.png 513w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1590px) 100vw, 1590px\" /></p> \n<h2>Improved Editing and and and</h2> \n<p>Many have asked us to improve the Preview/Export/Publishing side. And you asked us to improve the editing experience. So here it comes.</p> \n<p>If you surround text with two equals signs, it will <mark>==highlight==</mark>. You can use a keyboard shortcut for it, along with two other inline styles:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Toggle highlight with Option Command =</li> \n <li>Toggle strikethrough with Option Command –</li> \n <li>Toggle inline code with Option Command `</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Statistics got an upgrade in 5.5, too. You wanted a character count that excludes spaces. You got it. Clearly, not everyone needs all these stats at once. We let you decide which you want to make visible. Eagle-eyed readers might have spotted this in effect in the first screenshot of this post.</p> \n<p><img src=\"http://ia.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ToolbarStats.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5317\" /></p> \n<p>On Mac, right click in the bottom toolbar or use the menu to pick and choose. On iOS, tap the stats bubble and toggle which stats you want to show.</p> \n<h2>Other Improvements</h2> \n<p>There are a several smaller improvements in iA Writer 5.5. You can find a list of some of them below. We’d encourage you to update and try them out yourself. It’s a free update so nothing should hold you back. If you haven’t purchased an earlier version of iA Writer then you can still try out all these features in the Mac trial app <a href=\"http://ia.net/writer/mac/trial/download\">here</a>.</p> \n<h3>Mac Exclusive Improvements</h3> \n<ul> \n <li>Hold Option when in Library contextual menu to delete folders and files without a confirmation</li> \n <li>Improved support for increase contrast accessibility option</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>iOS-Exclusive Improvements</h3> \n<ul> \n <li>Command Return to begin editing without touching the screen</li> \n <li>Tap and hold back button to go to Library root</li> \n <li>Tap title in Library to rename the current folder, Smart Folder, or Library Location</li> \n <li>Improved trackpad support</li> \n <li>Preview keeps scroll position in sync with Editor</li> \n <li>Added A3 and A5 paper sizes</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>Both</h3> \n<ul> \n <li>KaTeX \\gdef now works as expected</li> \n <li>Lists can begin immediately after a paragraph, an empty line between them is no longer required</li> \n</ul> \n<h2>What’s next?</h2> \n<p>We hope that this update finds you well and healthy. While individually we all had to deal with the situation, the way we work has stayed largely the same. The iA Writer team has been working remotely between Tokyo, Helsinki, Lyon and Zurich for many years. We don’t have any remote working tips for you other than communicating regularly and naturally. And we’re not virologists, so we don’t have any opinions to share there either other than wishing you to take especially good care of your friends, your family and yourself.</p> \n<p>At the same time, we have been more productive than usual. iA Writer for Mac and iOS will see another release with a core update to Syntax Highlight very, very soon. (It’s a core feature that was planned with the very first version but has been delayed for years and years). iA Writer for Windows is coming out with a major update including Syntax Highlight for English, and the long awaited new version for Android is as good as ready. In case you didn’t know, this is our tenth year. We have some nice things for you for the anniversary.

Begrudgingly we try to accept subscriptions as a new reality. But there is a limit to how many we can add to our credit card bill before we ask: Is this necessary? Is there only one business model for software, and, well, for <em>anything</em> now? Does everything have to be a subscription? The short answer is No. Read on for the full answer.</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p> If you’re not in the subscription space, you’re missing out and need to move much quicker than you are to make sure your business survives.” –<a href=\"https://www.priceintelligently.com/blog/subscription-revenue-adobe-gopro-microsoft-gillette\">How Adobe, GoPro, Microsoft and Gillette saved their businesses through subscription revenue</a> </p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>That’s what they say. There is rarely just one way to do things. There are plenty of other business models off and online. Why does everyone want you to buy a subscription? Why all that drama “We’ll die otherwise”? Isn’t that at least exaggerated? At iA, we have developed our app for over 10 years without a subscription. And we are growing in revenue, in users, and in quality. We are not the only developer selling apps. Some of the very best <em>sell</em> apps. Here are the questions we have:</p> \n<ol> \n <li>Why are subscriptions surging even though everyone hates them?</li> \n <li>Aren’t there other models? </li> \n <li>When do subscriptions work?</li> \n <li>When do subscriptions not work? </li> \n <li>What are our plans?</li> \n <li>What can you do?</li> \n</ol> \n<p>Warning: This is half a book. You don’t need to read it top to bottom. Pick the chapters you like. Just don’t come back and say “you forgot to mention…” before you read the whole article.</p> \n<h1>1. Why are subscriptions surging even though everyone hates them?</h1> \n<h3>1.1 Everything is a subscription!</h3> \n<p>Not just the App Store switched to subscriptions. In today’s so-called <em>gig economy</em>, everything is a subscription. Your cellphone contract is a subscription. Your <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/10/17216932/vanmoof-plus-subscription-price-date\">bike</a>. Your <a href=\"https://www.tanaka-megane.co.jp/ninal/\">glasses</a>. Even <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2015/04/dmca-ownership-john-deere/\">tractors are sold as subscriptions</a>. Like the Beatles said:</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p> If you drive a car, I’ll tax the street<br /> If you try to sit, I’ll tax your seat<br /> If you get too cold, I’ll tax the heat<br /> If you take a walk, I’ll tax your feet<br /> – The Beatles </p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>It gets harder and harder to own anything of value. Land, houses, and cars are to be leased or rented. If you are lucky to own one of these things, you better partially rent your house, car, holiday apartment out. Airbnb, Uber, and Co. sell us this opportunity as open, modern, and exciting.</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p> Last year, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that 55 million people in the U.S. are ‘gig workers,’ which is more than 35% of the U.S. workforce. That number is projected to jump to 43% by 2020.” – Forbes: <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2019/01/08/what-are-the-pros-and-cons-of-the-gig-economy/#52e69e361388\">What Are The Pros And Cons Of The Gig Economy?</a> </p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>Gig economy optimists would argue that young people don’t care about ownership anymore. They care about experiences! You can’t care about ownership if you don’t have the means. One of the many reasons why things are as they are is that those who decide, want to keep things as they are. And maybe that they “managed to spend less money”:</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p> “Take boots, for example. He earned thirty-eight dollars a month plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars. But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles. But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that’d still be keeping his feet dry in ten years’ time, while the poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet.” – Terry Pratchett, Men at Arms: The Play </p>\n</blockquote> \n<h3>1.2 Apple loves subscriptions</h3> \n<p>Selling software without trial is not a walk in the park. Getting someone to subscribe to your app for a cup of coffee is not easy, but easier than getting someone to pay 30 Dollars without trial. And then, paid software comes in versions. Getting people to replace their old expensive app with a new expensive version at full price needs the king of pitches.</p> \n<p>But… Just offer trials! And discounted upgrades! Yeah… Consumers expect trials and a discount if they move to a new version. And understandably so. But there are no real trials and no paid upgrades in Apple’s ecosystem. If you tell your customers “Sorry, but there are no update discounts on App Store,” they call you a greedy liar and report you to Apple for fraud. Oh, the irony!</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p> Unfortunately, productivity apps are a terrible match for app store economics.” – Stratechery: <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2013/why-doesnt-apple-enable-sustainable-businesses-on-the-app-store/\">Why Doesn’t Apple Enable Sustainable Businesses on the App Store?</a> </p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>What productivity apps need are <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2013/why-doesnt-apple-enable-sustainable-businesses-on-the-app-store/\">high price ranges with trials and paid upgrade support</a>. Apple doesn’t care much about paid or productivity apps. Apple is in love with subscriptions, games, and entertainment apps. AppleCare, Apple Music, Apple TV, iCloud… you can even <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/iphone/iphone-upgrade-program\">buy iPhones through subscriptions</a>. Clearly, subscriptions work well for them.</p> \n<p>On the developer side, <em>moving</em> to subscriptions can be a gate to hell. They usually make <em>less</em> at first. Incidentally the first year you pay the higher fee. Over time they <em>can</em> make more—if you manage to keep your users. That is not a given. The switch from paid to subscription can cost you a fortune. Not technically. The technology is there. It will cost you: users. And angry users don’t just leave, they rate you angrily and write angry comments. They feel harmed and they try to harm you as much as possible. Anonymous ratings, upvoting, and reviews make revenge fast, easy, and cheap.</p> \n<h3>1.3 Developers are pushed towards subscriptions</h3> \n<p>You might have noticed that there are no subscriptions for Apple’s own productivity apps. They are either free, like Pages, Numbers, Keynote, or very expensive and paid, like Logic, FinalCut, Motion. There is something humiliating about renting professional tools. Professionals like owning their tools. Imagine a hairdresser renting scissors, or a shoemaker that has to rent that leather cutter! How annoying would it be to pay for Final Cut monthly if you use it every day! As annoying as subscribing to Adobe’s Creative Suite. It’s very annoying if you are an independent designer or small agency working at 60 bucks per hour. A corporation that charges 300 Dollars per hour for their 300 designers obviously don’t care that much about the subscription. More about that below.</p> \n<p>The logic that professionals like to own their tools can easily be turned around. “You make money with it, we make it happen, so you may as well pay us regularly!” Like a tax on my work? Get out!</p> \n<p>Apple makes an exception for its Pro tools. Maybe that will change, too. Let’s hope not. But with its developers, implicitly or explicitly, Apple tries to get everyone on a subscription. Moving to subscriptions wreaks havoc every time a developer does it. Users protest and trash the developer. You can survive the anger waves, but you’ll keep some heavy scars. Why do developers switch when they know that their customers hate subscriptions?</p> \n<ol> \n <li>Apple takes 15% instead of 30% of a developer’s revenue if they offer subscriptions. That in itself is reason enough for developers to switch to subscriptions. At 30% your chances to make a profit — and that means: running a business — are hair-thin.</li> \n <li>Apple is more likely to promote you on the App Store if you have a subscription-based app because they see that with this model they can make a lot of money. Being promoted on App Stores, in Key Notes, in Apple Stores, and in marketing materials is invaluable.</li> \n <li>As bad comes to worse, if Apple doesn’t promote you, you have to spend money on App Store Search Ads, which takes another heavy cut away from your revenue. Are you feeling the pain?</li> \n <li>Apple doesn’t offer the ability to let users pay for upgrades. A paid app that runs out of sales because it saturated its reach thus has to convince everyone from the existing, loved app to switch to the new, unfamiliar one. Good luck with that.</li> \n <li>Subscription-based apps are listed under free, which is misleading and causes a lot of confusion, but it gives them additional exposure. That makes users click.</li> \n</ol> \n<p>In short, <a href=\"https://ia.net/topics/monopolies-apple-and-epic\">Apple’s monopoly on the mobile market</a> most probably doesn’t counter the surge of subscriptions everywhere. Cutting the Apple tax in half created a key incentive for developers to switch. Unless you manage to make over 30% profit, which is absolutely exceptional in our industry, Apple will skim that up every month.</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p> It’s extremely difficult for anyone with employees, or any individuals without other income, to afford to be here. Some people can make enough to cover full-time expenses, but most can’t. (Although I’d say the same thing about the entire App Store, really.)” – <a href=\"https://marco.org/2009/10/09/the-two-app-stores\">Marco Arment</a> </p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>But if you offer subscriptions, you get to keep 15% more of your revenue. 15% is about half of the profit a digital company makes, on average.</p> \n<p>We were ecstatic when we first heard about the lower revenue share. Then we observed what happens and we pictured the scenario asking for a subscription on our productivity tools and the excitement dropped week after week. We discussed it internally, up and down. We concluded that, if we offer subscriptions, we had to find a way to offer both ownership and subscription. In spite of the beating one takes it’s not obvious to say no to subscriptions. The technology is right there to be used. The incitement is huge. Here is an illustration for those who are more visual:</p> \n<figure> \n <img src=\"https://ia.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/To-be-or-not-to-be-in-Apples-terms.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\" height=\"auto\" class=\"logo\" />\n <figcaption>\n   9% is the bite that is missing in Apple’s logo. 15% is what subscribers need to pay to Apple. 30% of total revenue is what paid software needs to share with Cupertino.\n </figcaption>\n</figure> \n<p>Apple is more likely to help, feature, and support a popular app if it has a subscription. Apple will still show interest in your future if you sell a lot of apps. If there is no subscription planned, Apple’s interest vanishes in circles. They come back, showing interest in a featuring here and there, asking questions about your future, and if your response is “no subscriptions” or “no subscriptions only” their interest evaporates. Until they don’t ask anymore.</p> \n<h3>1.4 Developers are scared</h3> \n<blockquote>\n <p> Whether ’tis nobler in the mind to suffer<br /> The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,<br /> Or to take Arms against a Sea of troubles<br /> – Shakespeare, Hamlet </p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>As we have seen repeatedly this year, there are exceptions, but, generally speaking, developers are scared to talk about their issues with Apple. Understandably. Apple generally discourages going public. And Apple is the hand that feeds us.</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p> I like to bury my bad news in long posts with neutral headlines knowing the dramapress won’t have the attention span to read it” –<a href=\"https://twitter.com/cabel/status/552145613114990592\">@cabel</a> </p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>What do developers fear? That Epic’s provocative update got taken down is logical and expected. That they are <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/19/21373956/apple-fortnite-app-store-fight-legal-tax-antitrust\">about to get banned from developing all Apple software</a> is a demonstration of power. Developers are not afraid of that. Getting ignored is already bad enough. And why is that bad? Apple’s App Store is a labyrinth. Apple has planned and constructed it and it has almost total control over it. In other words, they control the exposure you get inside the App Store.</p> \n<p>If they don’t give you any exposure, you need to pay for it, or <em>somehow</em> create an avalanche of traffic, direct it to the App Store and hope that your potential customers through the walls, don’t get distracted and buy your app. If you believe Apple’s Analytics, chances are low that your traffic generates sales. They are much lower than selling it directly.</p> \n<p>So why don’t you sell your apps directly? You simply can’t on iOS. And if you have iOS, you want to offer the full package on both App Stores, for the sake of your customers, for the sake of your support crew, for the sake of Apple and their algorithms.</p> \n<h3>1.5 Consumers don’t care</h3> \n<p>Naturally, consumers don’t care about what happens after they pay. Life is hard. Business is business. And then life goes on. So cry me a river. Consumers pay for their app and the money’s out of the window. Why should you worry about who gets what share? You don’t worry much about where the money goes when you buy a Mars. You eat the chocolate bar and then move on to your next task. As a consumer, you don’t think that 1/3 of what you earn goes to Apple. And even if you knew that you wouldn’t care. 70% sounds fine. Apple must have its reasons. They build all this stuff! It’s capitalism! They deserve a share! After all, Mars also pays a share to the resellers! Ha! Case closed!</p> \n<h2>2. What other models are there?</h2> \n<p>For physical goods and services, there are a variety of business models. Different types of goods and services relate to different types of transactions.</p> \n<ul> \n <li>You can rent houses or buy them. </li> \n <li>You can negotiate at the flea market, but not at the supermarket. </li> \n <li>Insurances, water, and electricity come as a monthly fee. A subscription for a restaurant is not likely to be successful. </li> \n <li>Coupons are a great fit for chain restaurants but not for selling cars. </li> \n <li>You can give away things you don’t want, you can put them on eBay or ask your friends if they want them for free.</li> \n <li>You pay taxes by the mile and lawyers by the hour. </li> \n <li>And when it comes to plane tickets… What a crazy pricing model do they have!</li> \n</ul> \n<p>In other words: Even though they are very en vogue now, subscriptions are not a universally superior model for all types of transactions. Sometimes they make sense, and sometimes, they don’t.</p> \n<p>When it comes to software though they get annoyingly ubiquitous. Adobe, Microsoft, Netflix, Spotify, Slack, Google… they all sell or want to sell subscriptions… And some of them are extremely successful:</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p> Netflix’s penetration of OTT households [is] 75%” Business of Apps: <a href=\"https://www.businessofapps.com/data/netflix-statistics/\">Netflix Revenue and Usage Statistics (2020)</a> </p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>That you and all of your friends are happy users of Netflix and Spotify doesn’t mean that your users will be excited to pay you monthly for your ultra-minimalist calculator app. That Adobe and Microsoft were successful with their power move from paid software to a subscription model doesn’t mean that copying them will get you on the cover of Forbes. That Apple pushes subscriptions as if there was no other way to sell software doesn’t mean that subscriptions are the <em>only</em> way to run a software business.</p> \n<p>Subscriptions can work. But it depends on what you offer. There are plenty of ways to charge for digital products, Free, Ads, In-App Purchases, Freemium, Paid, Subscriptions… There is a wide range of ways to charge for your digital services. So when do subscriptions work? And when do they not work?</p> \n<h2>3. When do subscriptions work?</h2> \n<p>There are plenty of instances when subscriptions make sense. It’s difficult to systematically think of every instance.</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p> There are many different types of subscription models. Most are very straightforward, you get a monthly box and choose which products you keep and send back the ones you don’t want. Often, there’s a price incentive to keep everything in the box. Some will tell you what’s in the box before it’s shipped so you can opt in or out beforehand. Others are rental sites, like the way Netflix worked when it only had DVD’s: you choose what you want and they send it to you after you send back the last things you rented.” –<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardkestenbaum/2017/08/10/subscription-businesses-are-exploding-with-growth/#206eab306678\">Forbes</a> </p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>Here are seven business models that warrant a subscription:</p> \n<h3>3.1 You offer Entertainment services like Netflix and Spotify</h3> \n<p>If you offer a waterfall of movies or galaxies of music for the previous price of owning 5 songs or renting one movie, people will pay for it. The offer of 15 Dollars for <em>all the music you can listen to</em>, or <em>all the movies you can watch</em> is plain irresistible. The deal changes fundamentally if you, for instance, offer news instead of music and movies. Newspaper subscriptions are a tough sell unless… see below.</p> \n<h3>3.2 You own a Monopoly like Microsoft and Adobe</h3> \n<p>If you have a de facto monopoly, then you might get people to grudgingly subscribe to your change of terms. As a designer, for many years, there was simply no way around Adobe. They were able to push subscriptions on us because they knew that we needed them. But even for them, it wasn’t easy. After an initial slump in sales, they caught up and are now doing better than ever. Ask your independent designer friends though. Chances are high that they hate Adobe as much as paying state taxes.</p> \n<h3>3.3 You are part of a global elite</h3> \n<p>There are not many examples of city newspapers that can live off subscriptions. The New York Times is called <em>New York</em> Times, but in fact it is the global king of newspapers. The quality is unmatched, and people around the globe read it.</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p> As always, we should note that The New York Times is a poor proxy for the performance of the rest of the American newspaper industry. It’s a lot easier to sell digital news to a national and global audience than it is to the residents of one city.” –<a href=\"https://www.niemanlab.org/2020/05/the-new-york-times-success-with-digital-subscriptions-is-accelerating-not-slowing-down/\">Nieman Lab</a> </p>\n</blockquote> \n<h3>3.4 You offer a way to make much more money</h3> \n<p>The Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times are doing well because reading these papers is a professional requirement for those working in finance. If you don’t work in finance subscribing to the WSJ is not taxing a tool you work with. It is not a constant weight on your purse like the Adobe tax is for the indie designer. It’s not you doing the work and being taxed for using a particular tool. It’s a tiny investment in an information source with a huge return on investment. Here is the real kicker: The affluent financial <em>companies</em> and not private people pay for it. And companies don’t mind subscriptions that much.</p> \n<h3>3.5 You make companies pay the fee</h3> \n<p>Companies like subscriptions because they offer control. You need to hire 100 more designers? Get 100 Adobe subscriptions! You fire them again? Cancel the Adobe subscriptions. Buying 100 copies of Creative Suite would be a high sudden expense. Renting Creative Cloud instead of purchasing it allows for short-term reactions to dynamic projects. This flexibility more than pays for the extra expense that could occur over a longer period. More importantly, companies don’t examine and cross-examine every single entry on their credit card bill month after month. Here is another way:</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p> You get one free subscription every 30-days to use to support your favorite streamers. They get financial benefits; you don’t have to pay. When you go to click subscribe on their page you’ll be shown the option to use your free subscription while you have it.” – One Two Stream: <a href=\"https://onetwostream.com/blog/prime-subs/\">Do Streamers Get Money from Twitch Prime Subs?</a> </p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>Streamers can get a ton of cash directly from Amazon, rather than individual users. If you have an Amazon Prime account, you can link that to Twitch and subscribe to your favorite streamer. This gives you one free subscription to any streamer per month. And Bezos will pay them the fee. Meaning: Amazon pays itself. It doesn’t renew automatically, so if you want to keep “subscribing” with your Prime-bucks, you have to engage more with Twitch as a platform. Amazon knows engagement is what keeps a platform alive, so sharing a portion of the cost of Prime subscription with the Twitch arm is more than reasonable.</p> \n<h3>3.6 You offer heavyweight cloud and server-side technology like Amazon, MailChimp and Dropbox</h3> \n<p>We understand that what MailChimp and Dropbox do is happening in a place, at a pace and at a scale that requires serious tech muscle. We pay for Google Business Accounts because we understand that someone very competent needs to maintain all these servers. We pay for MailChimp because we cannot use our email app to send out 10,000 newsletters by hand, and our WordPress plugin can’t handle 1,000 newsletters. “Servers!” is a ticket to ride. (In fact, having “servers!” is not that expensive anymore, but consumers don’t know that.)</p> \n<h3>3.7 You are more charming than the Great Gatsby</h3> \n<p>Obvious subscription services are tied to big organizations that constantly invest in the service we profit from. An army of filmmakers at Netflix, an army of musicians behind Spotify, an army of journalists at The New York Times, and an army of tech experts at Google are constantly at work. What they offer is close to unmatched and it cannot be easily done without a constant flow of money from a huge group of people.</p> \n<p>You can try selling your newsletter, but it needs to be a hell of a newsletter. You need to do diabolically unique things, something like walk up and down Japan, and live stream multimedia poetry wrapped in digital washi paper. But be warned: You probably don’t have those talents, and even if… This won’t scale. There is no way someone like you will not get away with something like this:</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p> I realize we’re all a bit bombarded by ‘memberships’ and ‘subscriptions’ these days. But ultimately — this is a good thing! A scant ten years ago this ecosystem barely existed. Now it’s ever-more normalized.” – Craig Mod: <a href=\"https://craigmod.com/essays/membership_programs/\">Running a Paid Membership Program</a> </p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>If you sell small to mid-scale software, and it’s obvious that you only need a handful of people to do what you do, it already gets difficult. People that trust you and love you like a friend or a family member will subscribe to your minimalist calculator if you ask them in a charming, compelling way. Clearly, it’s more likely that you get fans paying for your talents on Twitch, YouTube, or on your PodCast than your productivity app.</p> \n<h2>4. Subscriptions do not work when…</h2> \n<p>Looking at the sheer number of offline business models and how they relate to what they sell, it shouldn’t come as a surprise that online and offline there are more cases where subscriptions don’t work than cases where they work. A complete list would be longer than you want to scroll. Here are also the top seven that come to mind:</p> \n<h3>4.1 Customers don’t understand the work behind the subscription</h3> \n<p>If you don’t live stream multimedia poetry walking up and down Japan, and you offer pretty much the very same thing month after month, people will feel like you charge rent because you can, not because it costs you money to run your operation. People have to understand, and see, and feel, and experience why they need to pay you constantly.</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p> Not all value is visible: In product-based subscription businesses, as well as the traditional buy-sell paradigm, the value-for-value exchange is clear-cut: pay money, get the product. In the service-based subscription economy, that dynamic isn’t always so simple.” – CBInsights: <a href=\"https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/subscription-business-model-industries/\">7 Surprising Industries Turning To Subscription Business Models</a> </p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>This is impossible. People think making software is not a big deal. After all, a copy of your app costs you nothing! They expect support but don’t think about its cost. They expect that it works on the latest iPhone but don’t think that updating it costs you. That may be unfair, but not everyone is an expert on software development economics.</p> \n<h3>4.2 Customers feel that they get a bad deal</h3> \n<p>Renting an apartment will be more expensive over time than buying it, but, short term, renting has a lot of upsides. Compared to buying, renting is easy. Renting is less of a financial risk and you stay flexible to change apartments.</p> \n<p>If you buy subscriptions but you feel that you end up paying more for the subscription in a year, than you paid for the full version previously, you feel bad. Subscriptions over a year should be substantially cheaper than your previous full version or your paid competitor’s app.</p> \n<h3>4.3 Customers love to compare</h3> \n<p>Customers always compare prices. They compare everything to everything. They compare indie gigs to Microsoft, Google Docs to Slack, and calculators to Pizza. They compare features, prices, and colors. And it doesn’t help if you compare the price of your app to a cup of coffee. People are better and faster at negative comparisons than you are at favorable comparisons.</p> \n<p>Subscriptions need to live up to all comparisons. Subscriptions are compared to similar subscriptions, and to all other subscriptions. Paying 15 dollars per month for Netflix and Spotify sets a tough precedent. If you ask for 15 Dollars, you better be as good and important as they are. If it’s a third, your operation better costs a third of Netflix’ operation. Ouch!</p> \n<p>Netflix and Spotify win all comparisons because they set an annoyingly low bar. Compared to buying DVDs, CDs or Mp3s or any other model, they win any comparison hands down. But you will always lose when compared to them.</p> \n<p>People will compare your monthly subscription to other unrelated subscriptions. They will not just compare your minimalist pocket calculator to paid minimalist pocket calculators. They will again compare it to Netflix. They will compare the price, they will compare how much time they use between your app and Netflix, and they will compare their layman estimates of how hard these things are to make. So be cautious when inviting comparisons of time:</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p> “Because a person’s experience with a product tends to foster feelings of personal connection with it, referring to time typically leads to more favorable attitudes—and to more purchases.” – Jennifer Aaker, the General Atlantic Professor of Marketing at Stanford Graduate School of Business, in: Quicksprout, <a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/psychological-pricing/\">The Psychology Of Pricing</a> </p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>Referring to the time people spend with your product can work if they spend more time on your app than on Netflix. If not, they will start comparing both time and price. With a pro productivity app you do have a chance to compete with Netflix, but only with pros and passionate amateurs.</p> \n<h3>4.4 Customers reluctantly pay for it privately</h3> \n<p>We all have enough on our monthly bill. But people are different. Some don’t mind subscriptions as much as others. You can convince some of a higher one-time expense. You can convince others of paying smaller fees constantly. There is a third group that doesn’t mind a smaller fee to try something. They try your product for a month. And then they leave or they pay and pay again. Sometimes they pay without using it, and then they pay so much that they feel like they need to use it. Maybe that will motivate them to do work. That’s not how software works. That’s how fitness clubs work. And getting fees based on self-guilt is not that cool there either.</p> \n<p>Convincing a private person to reserve a chunk of their expenses for a piece of software is just not easy. Convincing them to keep paying from their purse is not easy. Convincing someone that hasn’t used your software to stay on board is not easy.</p> \n<p>That the monthly expense they see on their credit card is helping poor developers if they don’t use your software regularly is not going to convince anyone to keep paying. Developers are not seen as poor people that need support.</p> \n<h3>4.5 Customers feel forced to switch from paid to subscription</h3> \n<p>Changing the deal is never a good idea. Especially if you charged a high price for your app, people see this as an investment in the future. You can release a new version or make them pay for an update, but changing the deal is a Darth Vader move.</p> \n<h3>4.6 Customers aren’t easily charmed</h3> \n<p>If you are charming, you can convince some, but you can’t convince everyone to buy a subscription. The same old claim that software can’t survive without subscriptions is getting quickly old. Software made it this far without it. For decades, software was sold successfully. And when it comes to productivity software, as we speak, the very best developers, like Cultured Code, Panic, or Omni, sell their apps with great success.</p> \n<p>You could try to explain that you wanted to please Apple, get around buying App Store Search Terms and make a profit to grow. The argument won’t work on customers. As explained, customers don’t care whom they pay. Unless you are very charming.</p> \n<h3>4.7 You could offer both</h3> \n<p>Not everything needs to be a subscription. And, likely, not everything needs to be owned or can be owned. But isn’t it always nice to offer a choice? What if you could choose to buy or to subscribe? Under pressure from customers who worried about us going down the subscription lane as well, we took the public stand that <a href=\"https://ia.net/writer/blog/ia-writer-5-from-raw-to-cooked-to-sushi\">iA Writer should offer both</a>. Finally, we found a way to do just that with iA Writer for Android.</p> \n<h2>5. What are iA’s plans?</h2> \n<p>Since July, we offer our customers a choice between subscription and ownership for our Android customers. The initial results are encouraging.</p> \n<h3>5.1 What are the results?</h3> \n<p>For obvious reasons, we won’t share raw sales data. Basically, Android was always a struggle, but for the first time since the very beginning, Android is moving towards sustainability.</p> \n<p>We tried different things before. We tried high prices, mid-range prices, low prices, free, and freemium. Getting Android users to pay for software is not for the feeble-hearted. So far, offering a free basic version with a choice between paid and subscription seems to be the only thing that works. And that doesn’t mean we buy yachts, it means that we might be sustainable in one or two years.</p> \n<p>The share of customers that decide to either buy or subscribe is at 50/50. Note: The subscription (USD 5.-) is substantially cheaper than buying the app (USD 30.-). In other words, we make substantially more via paid apps.</p> \n<h3>5.2 How did you set the prices?</h3> \n<p>The difference between ownership (30.–) and subscription ($5.-) is big. There are several reasons for that.</p> \n<ul> \n <li>30 USD is what all our apps cost. They do not feature par, but every app has things another app doesn’t have. iA Writer for Android has online collaboration. A big feature including all sorts of server-side magic that is completely missing on other platforms. We decided to make ownership the same price for all.</li> \n <li>We believe there should be a way for everyone to use our apps. Five dollars per year is really not much by any measure.</li> \n <li>Typically our version cycles are long. With the current iOS and macOS apps, we had one update in 10 years. The current versions have gotten free upgrades for 7 years. </li> \n</ul> \n<p>Five Dollars per year is not much by any standard, but we adjusted the prices for different markets. This is possible on Google Play. Apple’s App Stores allows <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/news/understanding-the-new-territory-pricing-and-expanded-subscription-price-tiers/\">some flexibility for paid apps</a> as well, but the same full flexibility is only available for subscription apps.</p> \n<h3>5.3 What are the setbacks?</h3> \n<p>We know that offering almost the same app, with an updated text view and optimized to run on Androids’ latest versions doesn’t give a strong incentive to change. We haven’t advertised the new app in the old app yet, but we have about 10% of our current free users to use the new paid app. This is higher than expected but it is still not where we want to be.</p> \n<p>We get a lot of flack in the comments from people complaining that the app is too expensive. Here is the deal: iA Writer for Android was a free app for years and it attracted a lot of people that like free. On a platform that attracts people that like free stuff.</p> \n<p>Moving from free to 30 Dollars is a much tougher pitch than moving from paid to subscription. So, naturally, we take a lot of hard punches, now. Overall though, the result is incomparably better than anything we have tried before.</p> \n<p>We can do better explaining what we do. For instance, there is a 30 day free trial for the subscription, but you only see it after clicking the first button. We are learning every day.</p> \n<h3>5.4 Learnings</h3> \n<p>Offering the choice between paid and subscription is nice because it puts subscriptions and ownership into perspective. It anchors the prices mutually. 5 dollars per year is low. It is even lower when compared to the 30 Dollars for owning the app. Owning the app in return looks high. And it should be. In fact buying, not subscribing one is how users invest.</p> \n<p>With all the talk about subscriptions as a way to support a software companies’ future, ironically, buying the app, not paying a small fee now and maybe again, or maybe not, deciding month by month, buying not renting is you show a company that you want to support them long term.</p> \n<p>Talking about subscriptions in public is a delicate matter. Apple is jealously watching what developers say. Competitors are watching and trying to get ahead of the game. Customers are watching and might get worried: What are they planning!? McKinsey suggests that you could offer both subscriptions and paid options in the transition from paid to subscription.</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p> For B2B software vendors serving large enterprises, a hybrid model combining both perpetual and subscription offerings for a two- to three-year period can protect revenue and offer a safe transition. A still decisive—but not big-bang—transition allows vendors to capture the full benefit from customers that value the subscription model’s flexibility most. </p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>This is not where we are going. We believe in the choice and we want to bring the choice to buy or subscribe to all platforms. Customers like the choice, and we like it. Clearly, after seven years of offering free updates, there will be a new version of our apps at some point. And even though Apple doesn’t offer upgrade discounts, this, next to offering a choice, is exactly what we want to do. We just have to find a way around the hurdles. But we have lots of other things planned, that we can’t talk about yet. It won’t be a simple move from paid to a choice between paid and subscriptions. It will be even better.</p> \n<p>Maybe subscriptions are not the best fit for productivity software. But, as laid out above, some do prefer subscriptions, especially if they are reasonably lower than buying the apps. In that sense, subscriptions will allow you to charge a fair price for your app and not compete in the race to the bottom. But if you offer the choice, you offer customers the opportunity to decide for themselves how they support you.</p> \n<h2>6. What can you do?</h2> \n<p>Nothing. Unless you are Apple. So, if you are Apple, here is what you can do: <em>Stop pushing us to a single business model that users hate.</em> Being the App Store of App Stores, asking for 30% for paid apps you set a horrible standard for all other Stores. And, no, that all other stores, Google Play, Play Station, Windows App Store, and PlayStation ask for 30% is not a good sign. It may just you being you, setting standards, but it looks a lot like collusion when such different places ask for the very same fee.</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p> If all the major app stores charge exactly the same fee across the board without sound business justification (and what are the chances that every store has the exact same operating costs?) then even if there is no active collusion between the parties, there is still a case to be made regarding the anti-trust laws.– EnglishMike in the comments section on <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/19/21373956/apple-fortnite-app-store-fight-legal-tax-antitrust\">The Verge</a> </p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>In the end though it doesn’t matter. 30% is too much. Now, here is what you can do if you are Apple:</p> \n<ol> \n <li>Lower the revenue share for both subscription and paid apps to the same level. Something in the range of credit cards, 5% would be great and get you out of the monopoly abuse zone with your direct competitors. 15% is still steep, but, short term, developers would not reject a 15% reduction for paid apps. You can keep your first year 30% share to save face.</li> \n <li>Simply allow trials. Please. It’s very very easy to do. But, pretty please, don’t mix the comments of cheap people that click around for five minutes and just don’t like to pay for software with the reviews of those who used and paid for the app. Let people who don’t like it move on and give room for reviews to those who know the app. </li> \n <li>Allow paid upgrades. Pretty please with sugar on top.</li> \n</ol> \n<p>That is all.</p> \n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ia.net/topics/subscription-or-no-subscription\">Subscription or no subscription?

Sales were good, reviews were good and in the end we got rewarded for our work with the App of the year prize from MacStories. Look at this nice prize:</p> \n<p><img src=\"http://ia.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/MacStories-App-Of-The-Year-2019.jpg\" alt=\"MacStories App Of The Year 2019\" /></p> \n<p>And now read these nice words:</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p> “Whether you’re a novelist, blogger, academic, or simply someone who’s looking for a great text editor, iA Writer represents the very best developers can create for Apple’s platforms in 2019 – a rare combination of thoughtful design, performance, customization, and native integrations with the system.” <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/stories/macstories-selects-2019-recognizing-the-best-apps-of-the-year/\">MacStories Selects 2019: Recognizing the Best Apps of the Year</a> </p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>This is not a design prize given by a design snob committee, it’s a prize by a team that, day in day out, tests and uses Apple software so thoroughly that Apple’s own Senior Vice President of Software Engineering, Craig Federighi, reads their reviews of Apple’s latest OS releases.</p> \n<p>Obviously, our team was super happy with MacStories recognition. Not only were we part of an impressive series of apps, iA Writer was chosen to be the best of all of them! What else can we say but: Thank you!</p> \n<h3>New! A local backup for iOS</h3> \n<p>The prize came at the right time. 2019 was a great year but the second half came with some frustrations, too. In the first half, we set back our plans to build a better templating system and invested a lot of time to keep our apps up-to-date with new iOS and macOS releases.</p> \n<p>We had high iOS hopes for Dropbox, Google and OneDrive to finally allow folder syncing in iOS. But instead of getting new native syncing options, Google, Microsoft and Dropbox are still twiddling their thumbs. We’re still hopeful as we heard that Apple is also working on addressing this feature on their end.</p> \n<p>iOS 13 had a rocky beta cycle with a lot of iCloud bugs. Apple reverted the changes after a public outcry. Unfortunately, since iOS 13.2 some of our customers have experienced a new iCloud syncing bug which prevents all apps from opening and saving files. If your device is affected, simply restart it.</p> \n<p>After seeing all the iCloud bugs with iOS 13, we decided to extend our built-in backups to all files. Files are backed up locally on the device where they’re edited. How do you recover your files? Go to the file browser and swipe left, then find the latest locally saved version. Here is how it works:</p> \n<p><img src=\"http://ia.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/iA-Writer-Backups-Howto.png\" alt=\"iA Writer Backups Howto\" /></p> \n<p>There is more: You can share, export, publish, print, and copy directly from context menu in Library. We added a Copy Markdown action (includes Content Blocks), you can share any file to other apps, and our best-in-class Word export keeps improving with bug fixes and new features. And, again, everything comes as a free update.
