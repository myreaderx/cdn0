Just before sunrise on July 16, 1945, in a secluded spot in a central New Mexican desert, a prototype bomb nicknamed \"Gadget\" was hoisted to the top of a 100-foot tower and detonated. The blast vaporized the steel tower and produced a mushroom cloud rising to more than 38,000 feet. The heat from the explosion melted the sandy soil around the tower into a mildly radioactive glassy crust now known as \"trinitite.\" And the shock wave broke windows as far as 120 miles away.</p>\n<p>After the Trinity test, Richard Feynman recalled finding his colleague, Robert Wilson, sitting despondently amid the celebration. \"It's a terrible thing that we made,\" Feynman remembered him saying. Hans Bethe famously observed, \"The physicists have known sin. And this is a knowledge which they cannot lose.\" It's often said that physicists became so intent on the intellectual challenge of building an atomic bomb that they lost sight of the profound implications of what they were creating.</p>\n<p>Those implications became all too clear on August 6, 1945, when a gun-triggered fission bomb dubbed \"Little Boy\" fell on Hiroshima, killing an estimated 70,000 to 130,000 people. Three days later, the implosion-triggered \"Fat Man\" was dropped on Nagasaki, adding another 45,000 human casualties. The United States won the war but at a horrific cost. The world has been haunted by the prospect of a devastating nuclear apocalypse ever since—and so has TV and the movies. So to mark this somber occasion, we've compiled a watch list of films and shows that we feel best reflect the complicated legacy of the atomic bomb.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1687982#p3\">Read 55 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1687982&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=GIhhKiGhcwU:bLQ3ZvZIdk0:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=GIhhKiGhcwU:bLQ3ZvZIdk0:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=GIhhKiGhcwU:bLQ3ZvZIdk0:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=GIhhKiGhcwU:bLQ3ZvZIdk0:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=GIhhKiGhcwU:bLQ3ZvZIdk0:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=GIhhKiGhcwU:bLQ3ZvZIdk0:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 10 Aug 2020 21:40:36 +0000","feedId":2,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/atomic-movie-montage-800x450.jpg","linkMd5":"74d683ce90aa4ca16cd9d1322f5db43a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn23@2020_6/2020-08-11/1597119453255_e904245114c9407a.webp","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/atomic-movie-montage-800x450.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn23@2020_6/2020-08-11/1597119453255_e904245114c9407a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=GIhhKiGhcwU:bLQ3ZvZIdk0:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn35@2020_1/2020-08-11/1597119471970_f5e318e36eb4af42.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=GIhhKiGhcwU:bLQ3ZvZIdk0:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn51@2020_4/2020-08-11/1597119468931_3465d4e342f68055.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn55@2020_4/2020-08-11/1597119468855_24b37a558f772a43.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn43@2020_5/2020-08-11/1597119478704_f9fb6170e557e50a.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-11 12:17:13","updatedTime":"2020-08-11 12:17:13","title":"Greed may be good when it comes to solar power","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1698008","description":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n<figure class=\"intro-image intro-left\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/36776403666_a4aa6f7098_k-800x591.jpg\" alt=\"Image of a rooftop solar install.\"><p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/36776403666_a4aa6f7098_k.jpg\" class=\"enlarge-link\" data-height=\"872\" data-width=\"1181\">Enlarge</a> (credit: <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"caption-link\" href=\"https://www.energy.gov/eere/articles/road-resilience-rooftop-solar\">Jeff Martin/DOE</a>)</p>  </figure><div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>Based purely on economics, there should be a lot more solar panels on roofs in the United States. With the dramatic plunge in the price of panels, solar systems have become competitive with the cost of electricity in a growing number of states, leaving the question of sun exposure to be the primary driver of whether adoption makes sense. Yet photovoltaic-equipped houses remain a rarity in the US, despite many states pushing for the adoption of renewable energy.</p>\n<p>So why isn't that push working? To try to find out, a small team of researchers worked with a non-profit that promotes solar installs, helping test out two different message. One message focused on self-interest and emphasized the economic benefits of installing panels. The other was what's termed \"pro-social,\" meaning it emphasized that installation of solar would bring benefits to the community. As the researchers found, self-interest was king—even after the promotion was over. But self-interest did have a side benefit in that the systems that were installed tended to get the most energy out of their panels.</p>\n<h2>Scripting Solarize</h2>\n<p>The work relies on a program called Solarize. Solarize runs town-level programs that include a single installer that provides the entire town with a group rate. Program ambassadors also run pro-solar programs within the town, encouraging adoption. These programs were the ones targeted by the researchers, who arranged an experiment based on the message delivered by these ambassadors. Some towns received messages that focused on self-interest, like “save thousands by installing solar.” Others were more community-focused—“Our community is doing something together to have more clean energy,” for example. The researchers worked with the program in Connecticut (one of the researchers is at Yale), which has expensive electricity.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1698008#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1698008&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=H96GShi7vlo:fbHXv4AEd3A:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=H96GShi7vlo:fbHXv4AEd3A:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=H96GShi7vlo:fbHXv4AEd3A:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=H96GShi7vlo:fbHXv4AEd3A:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=H96GShi7vlo:fbHXv4AEd3A:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=H96GShi7vlo:fbHXv4AEd3A:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 10 Aug 2020 22:56:33 +0000","feedId":2,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/36776403666_a4aa6f7098_k-800x591.jpg","linkMd5":"1df29b7793b93d06995a40501d0dba60","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn19@2020_5/2020-08-11/1597119450912_9455b478dc4cbf23.webp","author":"John Timmer","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/36776403666_a4aa6f7098_k-800x591.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn19@2020_5/2020-08-11/1597119450912_9455b478dc4cbf23.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=H96GShi7vlo:fbHXv4AEd3A:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn47@2020_1/2020-08-11/1597119468987_f45c8de07f270d44.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=H96GShi7vlo:fbHXv4AEd3A:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn39@2020_4/2020-08-11/1597119476775_ae570a568bf9e286.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn55@2020_4/2020-08-11/1597119468855_24b37a558f772a43.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn43@2020_5/2020-08-11/1597119478704_f9fb6170e557e50a.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-11 12:17:13","updatedTime":"2020-08-11 12:17:13","title":"Mission to Mars: Hilary Swank leads an elite team in trailer for Away","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1697910","description":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n\n\n\n\n\n<div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<div class=\"video\"><div class=\"wrapper\" style=\"display:block\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"980\" height=\"550\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3f_REapPwio?start=0&#38;wmode=transparent\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></div><p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\">Hillary Swank stars as an elite astronaut preparing for a crewed mission to Mars in the new Netflix sci-fi drama series <em>Away</em>. </p></div>\n<p>An elite international team of astronauts must leave family and friends behind for a three-year crewed mission to Mars in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Away_(TV_series)\"><em>Away</em></a>, a new science fiction drama from Netflix, starring Hilary Swank.

As American astronaut Emma Green (Hilary Swank, <em>I Am Mother, Boys Don't Cry</em>) prepares to lead an international crew on the first mission to Mars, she must reconcile her decision to leave behind her husband (Josh Charles, <em>The Good Wife</em>) and teenage daughter (Talitha Bateman, <em>Countdown</em>) when they need her the most. As the crew's journey into space intensifies, their personal dynamics and the effects of being away from their loved ones back on Earth become increasingly complex. ​<em>Away</em> shows that sometimes to reach for the stars, we must leave home behind.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The trailer opens with Emma's NASA engineer husband Matt playing the opening bars of Claude Debussy's \"Clair de Lune\" on a piano, as she presents their daughter Alexis with a gift: a necklace with three stones, representing Earth, the Moon, and Mars. \"And the string is me making my way back to you.
