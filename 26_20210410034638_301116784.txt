In late December, the State Administration for Market Regulation said it had launched an antitrust probe into Alibaba. SAMR, the country&#8217;s top market regulator, said on Saturday it had determined that Alibaba had been &#8220;abusing market dominance&#8221; since 2015 by forcing its merchants to sell on one of the two main e-commerce sites in China instead of letting them choose freely.</p>\n<p>Since late 2020, a clutch of internet giants <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/13/china-literature-alibaba-fined/\">including Tencent and Alibaba</a> have been hit with fines for violating anti-competition practices. The meager sums of these punishments were symbolic at best compared to the benefits the tech firms reap from their market concentration. No companies have been told to break up their empires and users still have to hop between different super-apps that block each other off.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>In recent weeks, however, there are signs that the antitrust campaign is getting more serious. The latest fine on Alibaba is equivalent to 4% of the company&#8217;s revenue generated in the calendar year of 2019 in China.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Today, we received the Administrative Penalty Decision issued by the State Administration for Market Regulation of the People’s Republic of China,&#8221; Alibaba said in a statement. &#8220;We accept the penalty with sincerity and will ensure our compliance with determination. To serve our responsibility to society, we will operate in accordance with the law with utmost diligence, continue to strengthen our compliance systems and build on growth through innovation.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The thick walls that tech companies build against each other are starting to break down, too. Alibaba has submitted an application to have its shopping deals app run on WeChat&#8217;s mini program platform, Wang Hai, an Alibaba executive, recently confirmed.</p>\n<p>For years, Alibaba services have been absent from Tencent&#8217;s sprawling lite app ecosystem, which now features millions of third-party services. Vice versa, WeChat is notably missing from Alibaba&#8217;s online marketplaces as a payment method. If passed, the WeChat-powered Alibaba mini app would break with precedent of the pair&#8217;s long stand-off.</p>\n<p><em>This is a developing story.</em></p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"he4uzHLgrY\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/27/ant-group-financial-clampdown/\">China lays out &#8216;rectification&#8217; plan for Jack Ma&#8217;s fintech empire Ant</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;China lays out &#8216;rectification&#8217; plan for Jack Ma&#8217;s fintech empire Ant&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/27/ant-group-financial-clampdown/embed/#?secret=he4uzHLgrY\" data-secret=\"he4uzHLgrY\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p><audio style=\"display: none;\" controls=\"controls\"></audio></p>\n<p><audio style=\"display: none;\" controls=\"controls\"></audio></p>\n<p><audio style=\"display: none;\" controls=\"controls\"></audio></p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=dVJCqXETFZI:j9H4hyQLNms:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=dVJCqXETFZI:j9H4hyQLNms:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=dVJCqXETFZI:j9H4hyQLNms:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=dVJCqXETFZI:j9H4hyQLNms:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=dVJCqXETFZI:j9H4hyQLNms:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=dVJCqXETFZI:j9H4hyQLNms:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=dVJCqXETFZI:j9H4hyQLNms:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=dVJCqXETFZI:j9H4hyQLNms:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/dVJCqXETFZI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 10 Apr 2021 02:36:00 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"ce6e069033878bf64166609f25f8fd91","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn41@2020_3/2021/04/10/03-45-40-108_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Rita Liao","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn41@2020_3/2021/04/10/03-45-40-108_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn79@2020_1/2021/04/10/03-45-42-483_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn72@2020_5/2021/04/10/03-45-41-674_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=dVJCqXETFZI:j9H4hyQLNms:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn74@2020_1/2021/04/10/03-45-41-518_0c461803c2580007.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=dVJCqXETFZI:j9H4hyQLNms:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn91@2020_2/2021/04/10/03-45-41-779_9d391c74b84f2a45.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn8@2020_5/2021/04/10/03-45-59-308_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/dVJCqXETFZI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn75@2020_4/2021/04/10/03-45-41-552_f9c813c7f2b33b9a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618026338946},{"createdTime":"2021-04-10 11:45:39","updatedTime":"2021-04-10 11:45:39","title":"Google denies Pixel 5a 5G cancelation, confirming it’s coming this year","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2136701","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Sometimes you’ve just got to confirm an unannounced product to put the rumors to bed, I guess. That was Google’s strategy this afternoon, following earlier rumors <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-5a-5g-limited-release-us-japan\">from Android Central</a> that a chip shortage had put the kibosh on the mid-budget phone.</p>\n<p>In a comment to TechCrunch, a Google spokesperson noted, “Pixel 5a 5G is not cancelled. It will be available later this year in the U.S. and Japan and announced in line with when last year’s a-series phone was introduced.”</p>\n<p>That time frame would put the device’s arrival around late-summer, meaning it won’t arrive in time for Google I/O in May, as some speculated. Interestingly, the company appears to be limiting the device&#8217;s availability to two countries &#8212; at least at launch. That could, perhaps, be due to earlier-reported component shortages.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"4vC0WFLfGU\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/03/googles-budget-pixel-4a-addresses-its-premium-predecessors-biggest-problem/\">Google’s budget Pixel 4a addresses its premium predecessor’s biggest problem</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Google’s budget Pixel 4a addresses its premium predecessor’s biggest problem&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/03/googles-budget-pixel-4a-addresses-its-premium-predecessors-biggest-problem/embed/#?secret=4vC0WFLfGU\" data-secret=\"4vC0WFLfGU\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22375780/google-announces-pixel-5a-5g-denying-rumors-cancelled\">The Verge notes</a>, the company hasn’t been particularly precious when it comes to product announcements. The company took a similar approach ahead of the release of the Pixel. Either way, this isn’t exactly the standard big company approach to rumor denial, which is to either not answer or otherwise deflect.</p>\n<p>Google may well be on edge about its Pixel line these days. The phone line hasn’t exactly taken the mobile world be storm, resulting in longstanding rumors that the company is looking to shake things up. That, in part, has seemingly been confirmed by some fairly high-profile exits.</p>\n<p>Still, even while there have been issues on the premium side, the company’s budget &#8220;a&#8221; line has helped buoy its overall numbers. No word yet on specific specs, but the handset is not expected to be a radical departure from its predecessor.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"AgorZKhTHo\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/google-i-o-will-return-as-a-virtual-event-may-18-20/\">Google I/O will return as a virtual event May 18-20</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Google I/O will return as a virtual event May 18-20&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/google-i-o-will-return-as-a-virtual-event-may-18-20/embed/#?secret=AgorZKhTHo\" data-secret=\"AgorZKhTHo\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"aFWijCU7Ms\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/lgs-exit-from-the-smartphone-market-comes-as-no-surprise/\">LG&#8217;s exit from the smartphone market comes as no surprise</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;LG&#8217;s exit from the smartphone market comes as no surprise&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/lgs-exit-from-the-smartphone-market-comes-as-no-surprise/embed/#?secret=aFWijCU7Ms\" data-secret=\"aFWijCU7Ms\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=D0m3FNRB1uc:0MtlrGj8FV8:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=D0m3FNRB1uc:0MtlrGj8FV8:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=D0m3FNRB1uc:0MtlrGj8FV8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=D0m3FNRB1uc:0MtlrGj8FV8:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=D0m3FNRB1uc:0MtlrGj8FV8:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=D0m3FNRB1uc:0MtlrGj8FV8:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=D0m3FNRB1uc:0MtlrGj8FV8:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=D0m3FNRB1uc:0MtlrGj8FV8:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/D0m3FNRB1uc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 09 Apr 2021 22:52:58 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"b5fb79b80dca637efad91563630faf67","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn41@2020_3/2021/04/10/03-45-40-108_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Brian Heater","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn41@2020_3/2021/04/10/03-45-40-108_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn79@2020_1/2021/04/10/03-45-42-483_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn72@2020_5/2021/04/10/03-45-41-674_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=D0m3FNRB1uc:0MtlrGj8FV8:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn24@2020_5/2021/04/10/03-45-43-045_de6cc8238c07cf8a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=D0m3FNRB1uc:0MtlrGj8FV8:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn64@2020_5/2021/04/10/03-45-41-591_4976611b4e0046e7.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn8@2020_5/2021/04/10/03-45-59-308_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/D0m3FNRB1uc":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn99@2020_3/2021/04/10/03-45-41-593_aba4186e0810781c.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618026339101},{"createdTime":"2021-04-10 11:45:39","updatedTime":"2021-04-10 11:45:39","title":"Daily Crunch: Amazon beats back union push","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2136726","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Efforts to unionize an Amazon warehouse in Alabama appear to have failed, Facebook takes down fake review groups and a monkey plays Pong with its brain.

id=\"speakable-summary\">Security researchers say APKPure, a widely popular app for installing older or discontinued Android apps from outside of Google&#8217;s app store, contained malicious adware that flooded the victim&#8217;s device with unwanted ads.</p>\n<p>Kaspersky Lab <a href=\"https://securelist.com/apkpure-android-app-store-infected/101845/?/kaspersky/april8/index.html\">said that</a> it alerted APKPure on Thursday that its most recent app version, 3.17.18, contained malicious code that siphoned off data from a victim&#8217;s device without their knowledge, and pushed ads to the device&#8217;s lock screen and in the background to generate fraudulent revenue for the adware operators.</p>\n<p>But the researchers said that the malicious code had the capacity to download other malware, potentially putting affected victims at further risk.</p>\n<p>The researchers said the APKPure developers likely introduced the malicious code, known as a software development kit or SDK, from an unverified source. APKPure removed the malicious code and pushed out a new version, 3.17.19, and the developers <a href=\"https://apkpure.com/apkpure/com.apkpure.aegon/versions\">no longer list</a> the malicious version on its site.</p>\n<p>APKPure was set up in 2014 to allow Android users access to a vast bank of Android apps and games, including old versions, as well as app versions from other regions that are no longer on Android&#8217;s official app store Google Play. It later launched an Android app, which also has to be installed outside Google Play, serving as its own app store to allow users to download older apps directly to their Android devices.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"79xfGx1f9W\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/08/how-to-respond-to-a-data-breach/\">How to respond to a data breach</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;How to respond to a data breach&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/08/how-to-respond-to-a-data-breach/embed/#?secret=79xfGx1f9W\" data-secret=\"79xfGx1f9W\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>APKPure is ranked as <a href=\"https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/apkpure.com\">one of the most popular sites</a> on the internet.</p>\n<p>But security experts have long warned against installing apps outside of the official app stores as quality and security vary wildly as much of the Android malware requires <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/android-malware-system-update/\">victims to install malicious apps</a> from outside the app store.

The startup rightly identified that one of the tasks most important to building effective AI at scale — the laborious exercise of tagging data sets to make them usable in properly training new AI agents — was one that companies focused on that area of tech would also be most willing to outsource. CEO and co-founder Alex Wang credits their success since founding, which includes raising over $277 million and achieving break-even status in terms of revenue, to early support from investors including Accel&#8217;s Dan Levine.</p>\n<p>Accel haș participated in four of Scale&#8217;s financing rounds, which is all of them unless you include the funding from YC the company secured as part of a cohort in 2016. In fact, Levine wrote one of the company&#8217;s very first checks. So on this past week&#8217;s episode of Extra Crunch Live, we spoke with Levine and Wang about how that first deal came together, and what their working relationship has been like in the years since.</p>\n<p>Scale&#8217;s story starts with a pivot, and with a bit of rule-breaking, too — Wang went off the typical YC book by speaking to investors prior to demo day when Levine cold-emailed him after seeing Scale on Product Hunt. The Product Hunt spot wasn&#8217;t planned, either — Wang was as surprised to see his company there as anyone else. But Levine saw the kernel of something with huge potential, and despite being a relative unknown in VC at the time, didn&#8217;t want to let the opportunity pass him, or Wang, by.</p>\n<p>Both Wang and Levine were also able to provide some great feedback on decks submitted to our regular Pitch Deck Teardown segment, despite the fact that Levine actually never saw a pitch deck from Wang before investing (more on that later). If you&#8217;d like your pitch deck reviewed by experienced founders and investors on a future episode, <a href=\"https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/Lutrgz8Q\">you can submit your deck here</a>.</p>\n<h2>Knowing when to bend the rules</h2>\n<p>As mentioned, Levine and Accel&#8217;s initial investment in Scale came from a cold email sent after the company appeared on Product Hunt. Wang said the team had just put out an early version of Scale, and then noticed that it was up on Product Hunt — it was submitted by someone else. The community response was encouraging, and it also led to Levine reaching out via email.</p>\n<p>&#8220;One of the side effects of that, one of the outcomes, was that we got this cold email from Dan,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We really knew nothing about Dan until his cold email. So like many great stories that started with a bold, cold email. And we were pretty stressed about it at the time, because in YC, they tell you pretty definitively, &#8216;Hey, don&#8217;t talk to a VC during the batch,&#8217; and we were squarely in the middle of the batch.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Wang and the team were so nervous that they even considered &#8220;ghosting&#8221; Dan despite his obvious interest and the prestige of Accel as an investment firm. In the end, they decided to &#8220;go rogue&#8221; and respond, which led to a meeting at the Accel offices in Palo Alto.</p>\n<p><div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Ye64BIG4SuU:rzALtycDqps:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Ye64BIG4SuU:rzALtycDqps:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Ye64BIG4SuU:rzALtycDqps:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Ye64BIG4SuU:rzALtycDqps:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=Ye64BIG4SuU:rzALtycDqps:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Ye64BIG4SuU:rzALtycDqps:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=Ye64BIG4SuU:rzALtycDqps:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Ye64BIG4SuU:rzALtycDqps:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/Ye64BIG4SuU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 09 Apr 2021 22:47:20 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"e3ae4331e08d006639dd6919eae26ba0","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn41@2020_3/2021/04/10/03-45-40-108_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Darrell Etherington","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn41@2020_3/2021/04/10/03-45-40-108_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn79@2020_1/2021/04/10/03-45-42-483_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn72@2020_5/2021/04/10/03-45-41-674_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=Ye64BIG4SuU:rzALtycDqps:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn40@2020_6/2021/04/10/03-45-41-977_2146182aa686347e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=Ye64BIG4SuU:rzALtycDqps:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn67@2020_4/2021/04/10/03-45-51-873_6cc3b5803a567552.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn8@2020_5/2021/04/10/03-45-59-308_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/Ye64BIG4SuU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn35@2020_4/2021/04/10/03-45-42-069_c64513850937fe52.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618026339109},{"createdTime":"2021-04-10 11:45:39","updatedTime":"2021-04-10 11:45:39","title":"Ocean Solutions Accelerator doubles down on blue economy with new track for later-stage companies","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2136016","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">The planet-loving folks at the <a href=\"https://www.soalliance.org\">Sustainable Ocean Alliance</a> started an accelerator a couple years back focusing on very early-stage companies, but this year they&#8217;re expanding the program to accept those that have already closed their first round.

With luck that means a bit of wind in the sails of entrepreneurs trying to save the world.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"ByCxrhZsdJ\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/accelerators-embrace-change-forced-by-pandemic/\">Accelerators embrace change forced by pandemic</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Accelerators embrace change forced by pandemic&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/accelerators-embrace-change-forced-by-pandemic/embed/#?secret=ByCxrhZsdJ\" data-secret=\"ByCxrhZsdJ\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"KOFZVyfr0i\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/how-to-get-into-a-startup-accelerator/\">How to get into a startup accelerator</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;How to get into a startup accelerator&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/how-to-get-into-a-startup-accelerator/embed/#?secret=KOFZVyfr0i\" data-secret=\"KOFZVyfr0i\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=67kL1Upc43w:X_zgA4FiIBQ:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=67kL1Upc43w:X_zgA4FiIBQ:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=67kL1Upc43w:X_zgA4FiIBQ:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=67kL1Upc43w:X_zgA4FiIBQ:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=67kL1Upc43w:X_zgA4FiIBQ:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=67kL1Upc43w:X_zgA4FiIBQ:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=67kL1Upc43w:X_zgA4FiIBQ:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=67kL1Upc43w:X_zgA4FiIBQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/67kL1Upc43w\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 09 Apr 2021 22:44:16 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"82b50834288dd7c9cd0db647762244d6","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn41@2020_3/2021/04/10/03-45-40-108_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Devin Coldewey","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn41@2020_3/2021/04/10/03-45-40-108_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn79@2020_1/2021/04/10/03-45-42-483_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn72@2020_5/2021/04/10/03-45-41-674_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=67kL1Upc43w:X_zgA4FiIBQ:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn62@2020_4/2021/04/10/03-45-41-546_eea28b04ebbc0e24.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=67kL1Upc43w:X_zgA4FiIBQ:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn100@2020_1/2021/04/10/03-45-41-631_00cbcc3e58fc51a9.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn8@2020_5/2021/04/10/03-45-59-308_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/67kL1Upc43w":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn51@2020_6/2021/04/10/03-45-42-062_b0d8034eeee09c88.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618026339110},{"createdTime":"2021-04-10 11:45:39","updatedTime":"2021-04-10 11:45:39","title":"European tech event mainstays Shift and TOA find new homes, new models, post-COVID","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2136522","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Given the pandemic, huge changes are being wrought in tech events, something which used to be the lifeblood of the industry. Many a startup has pitched to win funding, and many a hackathon has formed teams that went on to greater things. It’s a sad fact that this era is over, at least until the pandemic has fully passed, but this could take some time. Two significant European events have now had to change in order to carry their brands into new realms.</p>\n<p>European breakout success story <a href=\"http://Infobip.com\">Infobip</a> (which has raised more than $200 million) was born out of Croatia. And so was the seminal developer conference <a href=\"https://shiftconf.co/\">Shift</a>. With Infobip needing that engineering community, and Shift needing a more stable home in uncertain times, it seems only natural that Infobip would put developers front and center of their company strategy with the acquisition of Shift, and appointing its founder and CEO <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ivanburazin/\">Ivan Burazin</a> to the board as chief developer experience officer. Shift will now form the basis of Infobip’s all-new Developer Experience department.</p>\n<p>As Burazin said: “The vision was always to become one of the largest developer conferences in the world, and also to strengthen Croatia’s connection to the world of software developers. So now with the backing of a unicorn and the freedom to keep working on independently, the vision seems to have finally become possible.”</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>He says Shift won’t disappear, but will now expand globally, first to the U.S. and then to Latin America and southeast Asia, initially in remote events.</p>\n<p>Infobip CEO Silvio Kutić said: “Infobip is on a growth trajectory to expand rapidly into the B2C vertical, or more specifically Business-to-Developer (B2D) space. Having Ivan on board with his experience as the founder of Codeanywhere, a B2D SaaS company, and creator of Shift, the largest developer conference in the region, will be an asset to us going forward.”</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, a key startup and founder/investor-oriented conference &#8220;Tech Open Air Berlin” is also changing.</p>\n<p>Tech Open Air (TOA), was known for its technology and startup festival, which attracted upwards of 20,000 people in Berlin every summer, but it has now pivoted into a new brand: <a href=\"http://toaklub.com\">TOA Klub</a>. This will now be a “cohort-based learning and doing platform.” The four-six weeks of online programs will be aimed at helping professionals progress in the tech industry.</p>\n<p>TOA Klub will offer Founders Klub (for founders learning to startup); Investors Klub (for newbie investors); Crypto Klub (a “crash course in the crypto field”); and Co-Creators Klub (for founders looking to pivot and grow).</p>\n<p>The first confirmed mentors and speakers include Rolf Schrömgens (founder, Trivago), Dominik Richter (founder, HelloFresh) and Jeannette zu Fürstenberg (founding partner, La Famiglia VC).</p>\n<p>Nikolas Woischnik, founder of TOA said: “The world will come out of this pandemic having digitally aged by decades, not years. The complexity of our business environment has greatly accelerated. At TOA this gives our long-time mission of &#8220;making people, organizations and the planet futureproof&#8221; ever more purpose. With the launch of Klub, it is time for us to leverage technology to deliver on our mission in a more impactful and accessible way.”</p>\n<p>I for one am glad these greats brands have found new homes, because I know the brands and the founders both carry huge respect in the European startup scene.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"0vYPnpcRXi\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/17/where-top-vcs-are-investing-in-remote-events/\">Where top VCs are investing in remote events</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Where top VCs are investing in remote events&#8221;

The company plans to use capital generated via its public listing to fund the launch of passenger service, which is expected to begin in 2024. And Joby still must complete certification of its aircraft and develop manufacturing facilities, but it is already on its way to achieving both. The company is also planning to begin construction on a 450,000-square-foot manufacturing facility, designed in conjunction with Toyota, later this year.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>The upshot: Bevirt has a lot to share.

Many of the great technologies that we use today were born out of open-source development: Android, Firefox, VLC media player, MongoDB, Linux, Docker and Python, just to name a few, with many of these also developing into very successful for-profit companies.</p>\n<p>While there are some dedicated open-source investors such as the Apache Software Foundation incubator and OSS Capital, the majority of open-source companies will raise from traditional venture capital firms.</p>\n<p>Our team has raised from traditional venture capital firms like Speedinvest, open-source-specific firms like OSS, and even from more hybrid firms like OpenOcean, which was created by the founders and senior leadership teams at MariaDB and MySQL. These companies understandably have a significant but not exclusive open-source focus.</p>\n<p>Our area of innovation is an open-source AutoML server that reduces model training complexity and brings machine learning to the source of the data. Ultimately, we feel democratizing machine learning has the potential to truly transform the modern business world. As such, we successfully raised $5 million in seed funding to help bring our vision to the current marketplace.</p>\n<p>Here, we aim to provide insights and advice for open-source startups that hope to follow a similar path for securing funding, and also detail some of the important risks your team needs to consider when crafting a business model to attract investment.</p>\n<h2>Strategies for acquiring open-source seed funding</h2>\n<p>Obviously, venture capitalists find many open-source software initiatives to be worthy investments. However, they need to understand any inherent risks involved when successfully commercializing an innovative idea. Finding low-risk investments that lead to lucrative business opportunities remains an important goal for these firms.</p>\n<p>In our experience, we found these risks fall into three major categories: market risk, execution risk, and founders’ risk. Explaining all three to potential investors in a concise manner helps dispel their fears. In the end, low-risk, high-reward scenarios obviously attract tangible interest from sources of venture capital.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, investment companies want startups to generate enough revenue to reach a valuation exceeding $1 billion. While that number is likely to increase over time, it remains a good starting point for initial funding discussions with investors. Annual revenue of $100 million serves as a good benchmark for achieving that valuation level.</p>\n<h2>Market risks in open-source initiatives</h2>\n<p>Market risks for open-source organizations tend to be different when compared to traditional businesses seeking funding. Notably, investors in these traditional startups are taking a larger leap of faith.<div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Om-QxOuHKy4:v0XiZbXLrOk:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Om-QxOuHKy4:v0XiZbXLrOk:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Om-QxOuHKy4:v0XiZbXLrOk:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Om-QxOuHKy4:v0XiZbXLrOk:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=Om-QxOuHKy4:v0XiZbXLrOk:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Om-QxOuHKy4:v0XiZbXLrOk:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=Om-QxOuHKy4:v0XiZbXLrOk:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Om-QxOuHKy4:v0XiZbXLrOk:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/Om-QxOuHKy4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 09 Apr 2021 18:59:37 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"88815f231ccef38ff9e854e06fc20df8","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn41@2020_3/2021/04/10/03-45-40-108_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Annie Siebert","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn41@2020_3/2021/04/10/03-45-40-108_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn79@2020_1/2021/04/10/03-45-42-483_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn72@2020_5/2021/04/10/03-45-41-674_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=Om-QxOuHKy4:v0XiZbXLrOk:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn16@2020_1/2021/04/10/03-45-42-120_623dd3ca7f347044.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=Om-QxOuHKy4:v0XiZbXLrOk:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn71@2020_6/2021/04/10/03-45-42-260_d5ec71cff0b2041a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn8@2020_5/2021/04/10/03-45-59-308_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/Om-QxOuHKy4":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn88@2020_4/2021/04/10/03-45-41-700_7b9676e5d759d2dd.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618026338989},{"createdTime":"2021-04-10 11:45:39","updatedTime":"2021-04-10 11:45:39","title":"Wonder Dynamics raises $2.5M seed to equip indie filmmakers with AI-powered VFX","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2136700","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Practically every film production these days needs some kind of visual effects work, but independent creators often lack the cash or expertise to get that top-shelf CG. <a href=\"https://www.wonderdynamics.com/\">Wonder Dynamics</a>, founded by VFX engineer Nikola Todorovic and actor Tye Sheridan, aims to use AI to make some of these processes more accessible for filmmakers with budgets on the tight side, and they&#8217;ve just raised $2.5 million to make it happen.</p>\n<p>The company has its origins in 2017, after Sheridan and Todorovic met on the set of Rodrigo Garcia&#8217;s film <em>Last Days in the Desert</em>. They seem to have both felt that the opportunity was there to democratize the tools that they had access to in big studio films.</p>\n<p>Wonder Dynamics is very secretive about what exactly its tools do. <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2021/04/vfx-startup-wonder-dynamics-2-5-million-seed-funding-nikola-todorovic-tye-sheridan-steven-spielberg-joe-russo-1234730142/\">Deadline&#8217;s Mike Fleming Jr</a> saw a limited demo and said he &#8220;could see where it will be of value in the area of world creation at modest budgets. The process can be done quickly and at a fraction of a traditional cost structure,&#8221; though that leaves us little closer than we started.</p>\n<p>Sheridan and Todorovic (who jointly answered questions I sent over) described the system, called Wallace Pro, as taking over some of the grunt work of certain classes of VFX rather than a finishing touch or specific effect.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We are building an AI platform that will significantly speed up both the production and post-production process for content involving CG characters and digital worlds. The goal of the platform is to reduce the costs associated with these productions by automating the &#8216;objective&#8217; part of the process, leaving the artists with the creative, &#8216;subjective&#8217; work,&#8221; they said. &#8220;By doing this, we hope to create more opportunities and empower filmmakers with visions exceeding their budget. Without saying too much, it can be applied to all three stages of filmmaking (pre-production, production and post-production), depending on the specific need of the artist.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"odCc0HdZBj\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/27/ang-lee-making-of-gemini-man/\">Director Ang Lee explains why he built a digital Will Smith in &#8216;Gemini Man&#8217;</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Director Ang Lee explains why he built a digital Will Smith in &#8216;Gemini Man&#8217;&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/27/ang-lee-making-of-gemini-man/embed/#?secret=odCc0HdZBj\" data-secret=\"odCc0HdZBj\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>From this we can take that it&#8217;s an improvement to the workflow, reducing the time it takes to achieve some widely used effects, and therefore the money that needs to be set aside for them. To be clear this is distinct from another, more specific product being developed by Wonder Dynamics to create virtual interactive characters as part of the film production process — an early application of the company&#8217;s tools, no doubt.</p>\n<p>The tech has been in some small scale tests, but the plan is to put it to work in a feature entering production later this year. &#8220;Before we release the tech to the public, we want to be very selective with the first filmmakers who use the technology to make sure the films are being produced at a high level,&#8221; they said. First impressions do matter.</p>\n<p>The $2.5M seed round was led by Founders Fund, Cyan Banister, the Realize Tech Fund, Capital Factory, MaC Venture Capital, and Robert Schwab. &#8220;Because we are at the intersection of technology and film, we really wanted to surround ourselves with investment partners who understand how much the two industries will depend on each other in the future,&#8221; Sheridan and Todorovic said. &#8220;We were extremely fortunate to get MaC Venture Capital and Realize Tech Fund alongside FF. Both funds have a unique combination of Silicon Valley and Hollywood veterans.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Wonder Dynamics will use the money to, as you might expect, scale its engineering and VFX teams to further develop and expand the product&#8230; whatever it is.</p>\n<p>With their advisory board, it would be hard to make a mistake without someone calling them on it. &#8220;We’re extremely lucky to have some of the most brilliant minds from both the AI and film space,&#8221; they said, and that&#8217;s no exaggeration. Right now the lineup includes Steven Spielberg and Joe Russo (&#8220;obviously geniuses when it comes to film production and innovation&#8221;), UC Berkeley and Google&#8217;s Angjoo Kanazawa and MIT&#8217;s Antonio Torralba (longtime AI researchers in robotics and autonomy), and numerous others in film and finance who &#8220;offer us a wealth of knowledge when we’re trying to figure out how to move the company forward.&#8221;</p>\n<p>AI is deeply integrated into many tech companies and enterprise stacks, making it a solid moneymaker in that industry, but it is still something of a fringe concept in the more creator-driven film and TV world. Yet hybrid production techniques like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/ilm-shows-off-the-new-stagecraft-led-wall-used-for-season-2-of-the-mandalorian/\">ILM&#8217;s StageCraft</a>, used to film <em>The Mandalorian</em>, are showing how techniques traditionally used for 3D modeling and game creation can be applied safely to film production — sometimes even live on camera. AI is increasingly that part of the world, as pioneers like Nvidia and Adobe have shown, and it seems inevitable that it should come to film — though in exactly what form it&#8217;s hard to say.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"M8xidDot65\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/ilm-shows-off-the-new-stagecraft-led-wall-used-for-season-2-of-the-mandalorian/\">ILM shows off the new Stagecraft LED wall used for season 2 of &#8216;The Mandalorian&#8217;</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;ILM shows off the new Stagecraft LED wall used for season 2 of &#8216;The Mandalorian&#8217;&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/ilm-shows-off-the-new-stagecraft-led-wall-used-for-season-2-of-the-mandalorian/embed/#?secret=M8xidDot65\" data-secret=\"M8xidDot65\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=aDG2yue2OVs:KGcw8OPISL0:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=aDG2yue2OVs:KGcw8OPISL0:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=aDG2yue2OVs:KGcw8OPISL0:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=aDG2yue2OVs:KGcw8OPISL0:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=aDG2yue2OVs:KGcw8OPISL0:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=aDG2yue2OVs:KGcw8OPISL0:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=aDG2yue2OVs:KGcw8OPISL0:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=aDG2yue2OVs:KGcw8OPISL0:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/aDG2yue2OVs\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 10 Apr 2021 00:30:29 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"4e3772893ed6ad939c243e59d3edfd0c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn41@2020_3/2021/04/10/03-45-40-108_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Devin Coldewey","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn41@2020_3/2021/04/10/03-45-40-108_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn79@2020_1/2021/04/10/03-45-42-483_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn72@2020_5/2021/04/10/03-45-41-674_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=aDG2yue2OVs:KGcw8OPISL0:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn65@2020_6/2021/04/10/03-46-04-688_51fa9613fac1a6d0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=aDG2yue2OVs:KGcw8OPISL0:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn97@2020_4/2021/04/10/03-45-41-628_c3c9f8851a2d2328.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn8@2020_5/2021/04/10/03-45-59-308_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/aDG2yue2OVs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn63@2020_1/2021/04/10/03-45-42-196_4157399e3b90f2d6.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618026339109},{"createdTime":"2021-04-10 11:45:39","updatedTime":"2021-04-10 11:45:39","title":"Extra Crunch roundup: StockX EC-1, Early Stage recaps, unpacking Alkami’s IPO, more","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2135787","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Over the last few days, we&#8217;ve published several articles recapping panels from last week&#8217;s TechCrunch Early Stage virtual conference.</p>\n<p>Each story is based on an interview with a founder or investor who addressed some of the most common startup dilemmas.

She&#8217;s the co-founder of a startup called Ureeka, an investor at 1863 Ventures, and a professor at Georgetown&#8217;s business school. So it&#8217;s not an understatement to say that she understands the fundraising process from every angle. And moreover, she has both invested and fundraised for her own startup during this last year, where the landscape has shifted drastically. At TechCrunch Early Stage, she led a session on how to nail your virtual pitch meeting.</p>\n<p>Bradley covered how to allocate your time during the meeting, how to prepare, how to close out the meetings with a clear list of action items, and what to avoid.</p>\n<p>You can watch the session or check out the full transcript below, but I&#8217;ve also pulled out a few highlights from the talk just for you.</p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\n<h2>Conversation &#62; Pitching</h2>\n<p>One of the greatest shifts in the pitch landscape during the pandemic was the nature of meetings themselves. Because investors and founders can take 30 meetings a day from the comfort of their home, it means that conversation has been prioritized over presentation. Adding to the need for conversation is the fact that investors aren&#8217;t &#8216;getting to know you&#8217; IRL as they would in the past, and so how you interact (not just the content of your pitch) is critically important.</p>\n<p>Bradley explained that planning for extra time to answer questions and go deep on strategy is more important now than ever.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Now is the time to really have a conversation and deeply engage the investor in your story and your vision. You want to be conversational in nature, but still formal in tone. So you want to be respectful; you want to avoid jargon; you want to make sure it&#8217;s clear what you&#8217;re talking about. But it&#8217;s really much more of a two-way conversation than we&#8217;ve probably seen before. I think again, pace yourself, be really clear in advance how much time you have. One-third of the time should be spent on your pitch, and the other two-thirds, you should be prepared to field questions and really have that conversation. Pace yourself. Don&#8217;t rush through. If you only have 30 minutes, it&#8217;s probably not the best time to do a demo. You might want to follow up with a recorded demo or make an offer to do a demo afterwards. <em><strong>(Timestamp &#8211; 6:03)</strong></em></p></blockquote>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"He2SWqIMmY\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/28/justworks-series-b-pitch-deck-may-be-the-most-wonderfully-simple-deck-ive-ever-seen/\">Justworks&#8217;

With voting having broken overwhelmingly in Amazon’s favor, the union was quick to challenge the results.</p>\n<p>The RWDSU was quick to offer TechCrunch a statement from President Stuart Appelbaum after no votes broke the 50% threshold, noting, “We demand a comprehensive investigation over Amazon&#8217;s behavior in corrupting this election.”</p>\n<p>Amazon, unsurprisingly, was quick to take a victory lap. In a blog post credited to “Amazon Staff,” the company writes:</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<blockquote><p>Thank you to employees at our BHM1 fulfillment center in Alabama for participating in the election. There’s been a lot of noise over the past few months, and we’re glad that your collective voices were finally heard. In the end, less than 16% of the employees at BHM1 voted to join the RWDSU union. It’s easy to predict the union will say that Amazon won this election because we intimidated employees, but that’s not true.</p></blockquote>\n<p>While the company was quick to state that the election is “over,” the RWDSU is hopeful, both in terms of future organizing at the Bessemer warehouse and for what the movement will mean for unionizing efforts at Amazon, going forward.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"AIQ7k0ThKS\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/07/more-tech-workers-are-starting-to-unionize/\">More tech workers are starting to unionize</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;More tech workers are starting to unionize&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/07/more-tech-workers-are-starting-to-unionize/embed/#?secret=AIQ7k0ThKS\" data-secret=\"AIQ7k0ThKS\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>In a press conference held earlier today, Appelbaum suggested that Amazon told workers that they would have to vote against the union if they wanted to keep their jobs.</p>\n<p>“We believe a rerun election is going to be very likely,” the union president told media. “I think that if Amazon considers this a victory, they may want to reconsider it. At best, it’s a Pyrrhic victory. Look at what happened during this period. We exposed atrocious working conditions at Amazon for everybody to see.”</p>\n<p>Appelbaum’s comments seem to refer, in part, to numerous reports of workers urinating in bottles over concerns about stringent quotas. In the midst of an aggressive social media campaign at the apparent behest of CEO Jeff Bezos, the company initially denied reports, before conceding they may apply to some drivers. Amazon was quick to deflect blame to broader industry issues, however.</p>\n<p>“Amazon didn’t win—our employees made the choice to vote against joining a union,” the company added in its post. &#8220;Our employees are the heart and soul of Amazon, and we’ve always worked hard to listen to them, take their feedback, make continuous improvements, and invest heavily to offer great pay and benefits in a safe and inclusive workplace. We’re not perfect, but we’re proud of our team and what we offer, and will keep working to get better every day.”</p>\n<p>A key part to the RWDSU’s challenge is a ballot box the company reportedly pressured the USPS to install, in defiance of a National Labor Relations Board ruling. Appelbaum said the box “creates the impression of surveillance.”</p>\n<p>He added that the union has already been in communication with workers at other Amazon facilities, explaining, “We have already started talking to workers at other facilities, as well, before this election.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> Amazon has offered the following statement about the ballot box, &#8220;We said from the beginning that we wanted all employees to vote and proposed many different options to try and make it easy. The RWDSU fought those at every turn and pushed for a mail-only election, which the NLRB&#8217;s own data showed would reduce turnout. This mailbox—which only the USPS had access to—was a simple, secure, and completely optional way to make it easy for employees to vote, no more and no less.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"DENXACoU7o\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/09/amazon-defeats-warehouse-union-push-challenges-expected/\">Amazon defeats warehouse union push, RWDSU challenges results</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Amazon defeats warehouse union push, RWDSU challenges results&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/09/amazon-defeats-warehouse-union-push-challenges-expected/embed/#?secret=DENXACoU7o\" data-secret=\"DENXACoU7o\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=i8VZhQa_OgM:OYzyaIWkF2o:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=i8VZhQa_OgM:OYzyaIWkF2o:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=i8VZhQa_OgM:OYzyaIWkF2o:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=i8VZhQa_OgM:OYzyaIWkF2o:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=i8VZhQa_OgM:OYzyaIWkF2o:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=i8VZhQa_OgM:OYzyaIWkF2o:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=i8VZhQa_OgM:OYzyaIWkF2o:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=i8VZhQa_OgM:OYzyaIWkF2o:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/i8VZhQa_OgM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 09 Apr 2021 18:34:05 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"865cf4ffcd4ac07d2338c2fc1c6dff1e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn41@2020_3/2021/04/10/03-45-40-108_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Brian Heater","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn41@2020_3/2021/04/10/03-45-40-108_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn79@2020_1/2021/04/10/03-45-42-483_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn72@2020_5/2021/04/10/03-45-41-674_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=i8VZhQa_OgM:OYzyaIWkF2o:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn70@2020_2/2021/04/10/03-45-41-554_dff59f565c7f64b2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=i8VZhQa_OgM:OYzyaIWkF2o:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn7@2020_2/2021/04/10/03-45-41-553_a1791826192b69fc.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn8@2020_5/2021/04/10/03-45-59-308_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/i8VZhQa_OgM":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn3@2020_2/2021/04/10/03-45-51-930_d427d1b28b029d72.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618026339113},{"createdTime":"2021-04-10 11:45:39","updatedTime":"2021-04-10 11:45:39","title":"Building the right team for a billion-dollar startup","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2134485","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">From building out Facebook&#8217;s first office in Austin to putting together most of Quora&#8217;s team, Bain Capital Ventures managing director Sarah Smith has done a bit of everything when it comes to hiring. At <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-1/\">TechCrunch Early Stage</a>, she spoke about how to ensure the critical early hires are the right ones to grow a business. As an investor at Bain Capital Ventures, Smith has a broad view into the problems that companies face as they search for the right candidate to spur organizational success.</p>\n<p>In our conversation, Smith touched on a number of issues such as who to hire and when, when to fire, and how to ensure diversity from the earliest days.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3>What to consider when you first think about hiring</h3>\n<p>When a company is making its first hires — and then evolving into a bigger organization — the processes and needs may change, but the culture should be consistent from the beginning, according to Smith. From there, an emphasis on good early managers is critical.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I would really encourage you to take some time to think about what kind of company you want to make first before you go out and start interviewing people. So that really is going to be about understanding and defining your culture. And then the second thing I&#8217;d be thinking about when you&#8217;re scaling from, you know, five people up to, you know, 50 and beyond is that managers really are the key to your success as a company. It&#8217;s hard to overstate how important managers, great managers, are to the success of your company.</p>\n<p>So we&#8217;ll talk a little bit about how to think about that, as there&#8217;s a lot of questions around helping people grow into management for the first time. You, as a founder, might be managing people for the first time, so how to think about setting up the company for success.</p>\n<p><em><strong>(Timestamp: 4:15)</strong></em></p></blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/06/the-first-hires-are-the-hardest/\">The first hires are the hardest</a></li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h3>How do you build culture in the new remote environment?</h3>\n<p><div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=ii9fDwrMtww:0c25K-aGsBA:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=ii9fDwrMtww:0c25K-aGsBA:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=ii9fDwrMtww:0c25K-aGsBA:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=ii9fDwrMtww:0c25K-aGsBA:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=ii9fDwrMtww:0c25K-aGsBA:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=ii9fDwrMtww:0c25K-aGsBA:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=ii9fDwrMtww:0c25K-aGsBA:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=ii9fDwrMtww:0c25K-aGsBA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/ii9fDwrMtww\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 09 Apr 2021 17:05:24 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"5231a8306fc59793a14bf98650d72ffd","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn41@2020_3/2021/04/10/03-45-40-108_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Jonathan Shieber","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn41@2020_3/2021/04/10/03-45-40-108_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn79@2020_1/2021/04/10/03-45-42-483_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn72@2020_5/2021/04/10/03-45-41-674_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=ii9fDwrMtww:0c25K-aGsBA:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn58@2020_2/2021/04/10/03-45-41-545_4b422dd8adc6de35.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=ii9fDwrMtww:0c25K-aGsBA:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn28@2020_1/2021/04/10/03-45-42-795_b9f57eb943adbfe9.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn8@2020_5/2021/04/10/03-45-59-308_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/ii9fDwrMtww":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn23@2020_6/2021/04/10/03-45-41-951_6475d8bcecaa60f4.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618026339062},{"createdTime":"2021-04-10 11:45:39","updatedTime":"2021-04-10 11:45:39","title":"No-code publishing platform Shorthand raises $8M","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2136571","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a href=\"https://shorthand.com/\">Shorthand</a>, the Australian startup behind a no-code platform that allows publishers and brands to create multimedia stories, has raised $10 million Australian (just under $8 million U.S.) from Fortitude Investment Partners.</p>\n<p>CEO Ricky Robinson told me via email that this is Shorthand&#8217;s first institutional round of funding, and that the company has been profitable for the past two years.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been lucky enough to grow to where we are today through an entirely inbound, organic model that leverages the beautiful content that our customers create in Shorthand to generate leads,&#8221; Robinson wrote. &#8220;But we&#8217;ve been testing other channels with some success and the time is right to ramp up those other marketing initiatives.

Robinson said that unlike other tools like Webflow and Ceros, Shorthand was designed to be used by editors and writers. And although Shorthand does support the use of themes and templates, he said that&#8217;s not enough.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You need to provide flexibility without making writers get into the weeds of web design or making them use complicated design tools,&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;The focus should be at the level of <em>story</em> design, not <em>web</em> design, and that’s really what sets Shorthand
