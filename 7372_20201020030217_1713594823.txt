One example is the mortgage industry; lending institutions like banks and mortgage brokers process hundreds of pages of borrower paperwork for every loan - a heavily manual process that adds thousands of dollars to the cost of issuing a loan. In this industry, borrowers and lenders have high expectations; they want a mortgage document processing solution catered to improving operational efficiency, while ensuring speed and data accuracy. They also want a document automation process that helps enhance their current security and compliance posture.</p><p>At Google, our goal to understand and synthesize the content of the world wide web has given us unparalleled capabilities in extracting structured data from unstructured sources. Through <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/solutions/document-ai\">Document AI</a>, we've started bringing this technology to some of the largest enterprise content problems in the world. And with <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/solutions/lending-doc-ai\">Lending DocAI</a>, now in preview, we're delivering our first vertically specialized solution in this realm.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \"><img alt=\"Lending DocAI.gif\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/original_images/lending_docai_1.gif\"/></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Lending DocAI is a specialized solution in our Document AI portfolio for the mortgage industry. Unlike more generalized competitive offerings, Lending DocAI provides industry-leading data accuracy for documents relevant to lending. It processes borrowers’ income and asset documents to speed-up loan applications—a notoriously slow and complex process. Lending DocAI leverages a set of specialized models, focused on document types used in mortgage lending, and automates many of the routine document reviews so that mortgage providers can focus on the more value-added decisions. Check out this product <a href=\"https://youtu.be/akp0zeI6_6c?t=885\" target=\"_blank\">demo</a>. </p><p>In short, Lending DocAI helps:  </p><ul><li><p><b>Increase operational efficiency in the loan process</b>: Speed up the mortgage workflow processes (e.g. loan origination and mortgage servicing) to easily process loans and automate document data capture, while ensuring that accuracy and breadth of different documents (e.g. tax statements, income and asset documents) support enterprise readiness.</p></li><li><p><b>Improve home loan experience for borrowers and lenders</b>: Transform the home loan experience by reducing the complexity of document process automation. Enable mortgage applications to be more easily processed across all stages of the mortgage lifecycle, and accelerate time to close in the loan process.</p></li><li><p><b>Support regulatory and compliance requirements</b>: Reduce risk and enhance compliance posture by leveraging a technology stack (e.g. data access controls and transparency, data residency, customer managed encryption keys) that reduces the risk of implementing an AI strategy. It also streamlines data capture in key mortgage processes such as document verification and underwriting.</p></li></ul><h3>Partnering to transform your home loan experience</h3><p>Our <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/see-how-google-cloud-customers-transform-their-businesses-with-ai\">Deployed AI approach</a> is about providing useful solutions to solve business challenges, which is why we’re working with a network of partners in different phases of the loan application process.
