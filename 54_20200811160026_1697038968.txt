If you're like <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/state-of-marketing?__hstc=20629287.baf2406400c73bbe46641b2b9cd8a38f.1563824949326.1584540014200.1584545281370.484&amp;__hssc=20629287.18.1584545281370&amp;__hsfp=3755920611\">almost half of marketers</a>, your answer probably includes ad placement and targeting.</p>  \n<p>As we know, targeted ads are used to find the most qualified leads by showing audiences content that's relevant to them.</p> \n<p>Targeted ads connect you with the leads that are going to be the most interested in what you offer.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>So, how can you be sure that you're generating the <em>most </em>qualified leads with your targeted ads? While there's no sure fire way to tell, there's an optimization strategy you may be missing: behavioral targeting.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/audience-targeting-blog?_ga=2.187036584.1692937882.1597029621-940436819.1565181751\">Targeted advertising</a> allows you to use demographic information, including location or age, to surface ads to relevant audiences. Behavioral targeting uses web behavior as the determining factor, instead of demographics. This increases the impact ads have on audiences.</p> \n<p>Some of the criteria behavioral targeting looks at includes previously visited websites, search history, and past purchases.</p> \n<p>If a marketer spent 20 minutes browsing CRMs, Googling software prices, and reading customer management blogs, behavioral targeting would analyze those actions to show that person ads for a CRM product the next time they visited a site like Facebook.</p> \n<p>Behavioral targeting is used to improve campaign effectiveness. The sales manager weighing their CRM options would likely be more interested in a product ad for one rather than an SEO strategist, making them a qualified lead for the software company.</p> \n<p>Now, let's talk about how behavioral targeting can boost sales. If I were in the market for a social media scheduler and browsed websites like <a href=\"https://www.loomly.com/\">Loomly</a> and <a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/\">Sprout Social</a> before turning to Google, the search engine's behavioral targeting features would show me ads for the sites I visited first.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20Behavioral%20Targeting%20Gets%20Your%20Content%20Seen%20By%20the%20Right%20Audiences.png\" alt=\"a SERP that indicates previous web activity.\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n</div> \n<p>My previous internet behavior told Google what type of sites I'd already visited, so the search engine pulled the top list of options that are related and relevant to my search. And, when I checked my Facebook account a little while later, I saw that my web behavior influenced my ads there, as well:</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20Behavioral%20Targeting%20Gets%20Your%20Content%20Seen%20By%20the%20Right%20Audiences-2.png\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" alt=\"An ad being shown based on behavioral targeting.\">\n</div> \n<p>Pretty cool, right? And to run behavioral targeted ads, you wouldn't have to stray too far from your ad strategy. If your ad host offers targeted options, like <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/ads/ad-targeting\">Facebook</a> or <a href=\"https://business.twitter.com/en/advertising/targeting.html\">Twitter</a> do, create audience segments based on demographics, like location and age. You can also choose psychographics, like interests and values.</p> \n<p>After that, the software will do the work, choosing browsers to show your content based on the preferences you set.</p> \n<p>So, now we know that behavioral targeting helps reach those leads who are intending to make purchases. But what about the potential customers who are in a different stage of their journey?</p> \n<p>Enter: predictive behavioral targeting.</p> \n<p>Behavioral targeting uses website history to show users ads that relate to their interests. Predictive behavioral targeting is a form of analysis — it looks at those targeted ads as a whole, so advertisers can come to conclusions about audience interaction.</p> \n<p>For instance, this is a behavioral targeted ad I came across on Facebook. If I, and others with similar demographics, interact with the ad in the same way, WordStream's advertisers can infer that audiences like me respond well to similar content offer ads.</p> \n<iframe style=\"border: none; overflow: hidden; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\" src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fwordstream%2Fposts%2F10158788220547743&amp;show_text=true&amp;width=552&amp;height=400&amp;appId\" width=\"552\" height=\"400\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> \n<p>Predictive behavioral targeting helps improve the performance of ads for audience segments. It lets advertisers look critically at the similarities of customers and cater to them. This improves the effectiveness of behaviors being targeted.</p> \n<p>If you're still on the fence about using this strategy, don't worry. Let's look at the good and bad of behavioral targeting to help you make your decision.</p> \n<h2>Pros and Cons of Behavioral Targeting</h2> \n<p>There are a <em>lot </em>of ad types to choose from, and it's up to advertisers to choose ones that maximize the effectiveness of campaigns. Like with all types, behavioral targeting has its upsides and downsides. Let's look at a few.</p> \n<h3>Behavioral targeting pros</h3> \n<h4>1. Nurture leads through the buyer's journey.</h4> \n<p>Behavioral targeting helps you fill in the gaps you may have with your ad strategy. If you're seeing excellent <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/measure-content-marketing-roi?_ga=2.14572471.1692937882.1597029621-940436819.1565181751\">ROI</a> from brand awareness ads, but want to drive more conversions from content offer ads, behavioral targeting can help.</p> \n<p>For example, if you're using an ad to promote a new webinar you've hosted, turning on behavioral targeting will increase the ad's chance of reaching audiences who have been looking for webinars like yours.</p> \n<h4>2. Make more sales.</h4> \n<p>Behavioral targeting makes retargeting a better experience for customers. <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/retargeting-campaigns-beginner-guide?_ga=2.14572471.1692937882.1597029621-940436819.1565181751\">Retargeted ads</a> catch website visitors who have abandoned your site without making a purchase. Behavioral retargeting takes that up a notch by crawling more previous web visits.</p> \n<p>When you use behavioral retargeting, your ads will convey a more personalized message to audiences. They’ll remind those who closed your site to visit again with content that's already tailored to their interests.</p> \n<h4>3. Improve the overall customer experience.</h4> \n<p>When you analyze behavioral targeting results, you can begin to draw conclusions about how your audience engages with ads. For instance, if you find that millennial customers are looking for a certain product stack, you can start tailoring your ads in response.</p> \n<p>Behavioral targeting shows customers data-driven ads based on their web behavior. Based on the data you collect from the ads, like click-through rate and conversions, you can tweak the messaging or content of those ads to fit the browsing patterns of your audience.</p> \n<h3>Behavioral targeting cons</h3> \n<h4>1. Behavioral targeting can get costly.</h4> \n<p>Running<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ppc?_ga=2.15081142.1692937882.1597029621-940436819.1565181751\"> pay-per-click ads</a> isn't the most budget-friendly solution. Behavioral targeting falls under that umbrella, and it can get expensive. Make sure to check your advertising budget — and set budget caps — to make sure you have the financial bandwidth to produce ads for the entire campaign.</p> \n<h4>2. Ads can fail without proper audience knowledge.</h4> \n<p>If you don't know your audience, it's likely behavioral targeting won't give you positive results. Generally, the ads are shown based on audience segments you select. But, without proper knowledge of what customers respond to, there's room for lack of resonance from your target market.</p> \n<p>For instance, your buyer persona may be a 30-year-old marketer who's looking for a CRM to make the team she manages more organized. So, you decide to show that portion of your audience a brand awareness ad.</p> \n<p>But, if that ads messaging fails to capture the interest of the majority of your target audience, it won't be very effective. Behavioral targeting finds the right customers, but it's up to your ad to seal the deal. Make sure you're up-to-date with how your target market responds to ads to improve performance.</p> \n<h4>3. Behavioral targeting can lead to an advertising overload.</h4> \n<p>Be wary of producing too many. They can lead to an oversaturation of content and ultimately deter customers from wanting to engage with your ads. As a consumer, if I'm presented with numerous targeted ads from the same companies, I begin to mentally block out any advertising messages from that business.</p> \n<p>Use behavioral targeting sparingly. It'll save you money and catch customers at the right time. Be sure to modify your ad settings so you're not showing users targeted ads every five minutes, just which it's the most impactful.</p> \n<p>Behavioral targeting is just one of the many <a href=\"https://academy.hubspot.com/lessons/optimizing-ads-hubspot\">a</a><a href=\"https://academy.hubspot.com/lessons/optimizing-ads-hubspot?_ga=2.15081142.1692937882.1597029621-940436819.1565181751\">dvertising optimization strategies</a> that are great for <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/beginner-inbound-lead-generation-guide-ht?_ga=2.15081142.1692937882.1597029621-940436819.1565181751\">generating leads</a>. It's also one of the most effective. If you're finding that your current ad strategies aren't producing the ROI you're looking for anymore, this tactic could be your answer.</p> \n<p>How do you plan to use behavioral targeting to revamp your ad strategy?</p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fbehavioral-targeting&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 11 Aug 2020 08:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20Behavioral%20Targeting%20Gets%20Your%20Content%20Seen%20By%20the%20Right%20Audiences.png","linkMd5":"f97b818aca2bc9376620659d6e5d48f1","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn9@2020_6/2020/08/11/15-55-20-143_f003629dd2fd2f0c.webp","author":"Kayla Carmicheal","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20Behavioral%20Targeting%20Gets%20Your%20Content%20Seen%20By%20the%20Right%20Audiences.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn9@2020_6/2020/08/11/15-55-20-143_f003629dd2fd2f0c.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20Behavioral%20Targeting%20Gets%20Your%20Content%20Seen%20By%20the%20Right%20Audiences-2.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn26@2020_3/2020/08/11/15-55-22-013_43ae2d15e1136c38.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fbehavioral-targeting&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn42@2020_2/2020/08/11/15-55-21-786_b590d25d5967a41e.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-11 23:55:19","updatedTime":"2020-08-11 23:55:19","title":"Why A Digital PR Specialist Should Always Be Involved in Content Creation","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/digital-pr-specialist-content-creation","description":"<p>If you've been on the creative side of content marketing, you know not every idea is a winner. Sometimes projects gather a few links and then vanish under a pile of other content.</p> \n<p>To compete, you have to ensure the content you're creating, from the idea to the actual execution, is <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/customers/how-to-generate-effective-content-ideas\">compelling</a> enough to earn the coverage and attention you hope it'll achieve.</p> \n<p>And there's one really excellent way to do this: involve a digital PR specialist from the get-go.</p> \n<p>I work in digital PR and have consulted on hundreds of content projects.</p> \n<p>Below, let's review what I've learned about how content creators and digital PR professionals can successfully work together to create engaging, newsworthy content.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h3>1. Recognize viral ideas.</h3> \n<p>Digital PR specialists are responsible for interacting and building relationships with the media, so they likely spend around 70% of their workday online.</p> \n<p>Typically, they're reading new studies, picking apart articles, and getting to know writers. It's only natural that after experiencing the nuances of the news cycle, PR specialists are able to recognize which ideas make it big.</p> \n<p>If that kind of market research already exists in the brains of the outreach specialists on your team, why not utilize it?</p> \n<p>Getting feedback from the birth of a project means the trajectory of the content will be aimed for top-tier coverage. From the idea stage, it may make sense to create a ranking system with your team.</p> \n<p>Outreach specialists can categorize each idea by newsworthiness, relevance, and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-promotion-ideas\">promotional viability</a> to get a better understanding of where your projects stand.</p> \n<p>From there, you can go back to the drawing board or work with your best concepts.</p> \n<p>Using your PR pros will help expand creative ideas from using only what the creative team thinks is interesting to using what publishers think is interesting. Who knows? A single tip from an outreach specialist could turn a mediocre campaign into a huge win for a client.</p> \n<p>For example, at <a href=\"https://www.frac.tl/\">Fractl</a>, one of our biggest recent wins in the career vertical involved pivoting an idea about millennial work/life balance to a survey packed with \"would you rather\" questions.</p> \n<p>This new formatting allowed the creative strategist to ask more hard-hitting questions and challenged millennials to give concrete information about how much they'd be willing to sacrifice in their personal lives in order to get ahead in business. Some of the notable takeaways included:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>More than two in five millennials are willing to end a relationship if it meant getting a promotion at work.</li> \n <li>One in three would dump their S.O. for a raise.</li> \n <li>Millennials put their career before marriage: most are willing to postpone marriage for another seven years if it means they'd land a promotion.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>2. Keep data human.</h3> \n<p>In a recent study from <a href=\"https://www.buzzstream.com/blog/creating-the-most-authoritative-content.html\">BuzzStream and Fractl</a>, consumers ranked data analysis and index as the most authoritative form of online content.</p> \n<p>Those who work in content production are exceptional at analyzing these numbers to reveal their hidden insights. However, it can be easy to get lost in the data while exploring every perspective and lose sight of the most compelling pieces.</p> \n<p>Outreach specialists can help bridge the gap between data and human interest. If there isn't a cohesive narrative weaved throughout your data, a digital PR specialist can pull from their experience in studying what kind of stories emotionally resonate, and can help identify the true story in the data.</p> \n<p>While analyzing data, touch base with your outreach team to develop a storyline. Be sure they identify the simplest ways to digest the information you're trying to get across. If it takes longer than 60 seconds to understand the information in a graph, you're going to lose your audience.</p> \n<p>Oftentimes, content creators become attached to their data and believe every aspect is essential to the piece. While this may be true in some cases, oftentimes slimming down excess information can be beneficial to the narrative as a whole.</p> \n<p>Don't be afraid of feedback, and remember that outreach specialists spend <em>a lot</em> of time dissecting stories online. They're likely a trustworthy editor for your work.</p> \n<p>For example, when presenting repetitive information, it's important to provide interesting visuals to accompany data. When creating infographics about dangerous tools for a home improvement client, our team at Fractl decided to spice up statistics that would otherwise be mundane by placing the information within a tool shed.</p> \n<p>This project ended up being a winner within the home and garden vertical and I owe the promotional viability to the engaging way the information was presented.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/%5BGuest%20Post%20for%20Hubspot%5D%20Why%20A%20Digital%20PR%20Specialist%20Should%20Always%20Be%20Involved%20in%20Content%20Creation.png?width=600&amp;name=%5BGuest%20Post%20for%20Hubspot%5D%20Why%20A%20Digital%20PR%20Specialist%20Should%20Always%20Be%20Involved%20in%20Content%20Creation.png\" alt=\"Infographic helps humanize data.\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<p>If your data tells a story your audience wants to hear, graphs and images become as essential as the words on the page. Using industry knowledge from your outreach specialist's tool belt, you can elevate data-driven content to make it worthy of top-tier press.</p> \n<h3>3. Extract the juiciest takeaways.</h3> \n<p>You have a great idea, you research it, pull all the data, and it falls flat. Sometimes the stories you thought would be told through data don't come to fruition. But this doesn't mean your project is DOA, your outreach specialist may be able to revive it.</p> \n<p>Having an eye on the media means that outreach specialists may be able to extract something from a project that would have otherwise been overlooked. Digital PR pros can draw up some ideal headlines or takeaways to increase the project's chances of appealing to particular publishers and audiences.</p> \n<p>Whether it means tying the data to a trending story or pitching a vertical not initially intended to be a match for your content, there's usually always a way to distill data into a highly promotable headline.</p> \n<p>Chris Lewis, account manager and creative strategist at Fractl, said he incorporates feedback from media specialists into his projects.</p> \n<p>\"Outreach specialists are my secret weapon in creating compelling data-driven story content,\" he said. \"More than anything, they help me get out of my own way by always finding the promotable and most interesting parts of content and finding ways to highlight them.\"</p> \n<h3>4. Create better content.</h3> \n<p>Incorporating feedback from several team members throughout the life of a project can mean improved results from your content marketing efforts.</p> \n<p>Consider hosting collaborative meetings every once in a while or implementing edits from your outreach specialists if an idea falls dry.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, using a digital PR specialist in your content creation will help you create promotable content because of the work with the media and interaction online.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fdigital-pr-specialist-content-creation&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 11 Aug 2020 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/digital-pr-specialist.jpg#keepProtocol","linkMd5":"7254e177cdc584fa16ca62f114c4c6b5","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn21@2020_5/2020/08/11/15-55-21-793_f795c443636f3a02.webp","metaImg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/digital-pr-specialist.jpg#keepProtocol","author":"Delaney Kline","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/%5BGuest%20Post%20for%20Hubspot%5D%20Why%20A%20Digital%20PR%20Specialist%20Should%20Always%20Be%20Involved%20in%20Content%20Creation.png?width=600&name=%5BGuest%20Post%20for%20Hubspot%5D%20Why%20A%20Digital%20PR%20Specialist%20Should%20Always%20Be%20Involved%20in%20Content%20Creation.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn38@2020_5/2020/08/11/15-55-21-893_ba3466db66c4767b.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fdigital-pr-specialist-content-creation&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn65@2020_5/2020/08/11/15-55-21-740_cc7c73145b6ec61a.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-11 23:55:19","updatedTime":"2020-08-11 23:55:19","title":"How to Make Digital Credentials Your Most Impactful Marketing Tool","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/digital-credentials","description":"<p>Marketing can have an enormous, positive impact on both revenue and brand recognition. Which is why organizations spend so much time, energy, and resources trying to reach their target audience.</p> \n<p>And yet, from billboard ads and radio slots to the roughly <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/456500/daily-number-of-e-mails-worldwide/\">300 billion</a> emails sent each day, it's hard to boost your brand amidst all the noise.</p> \n<p>Fortunately, there are innovative ways to cut through the crowded market and build brand awareness: and one of those opportunities is through <a href=\"https://resources.credly.com/what-is-a-dc-infographic\">digital credentials</a>.</p> \n<p>Digital credentials have emerged as an impactful marketing tool across a variety of industries including corporate training, associations, professional development and certifications, and higher education. If your organization issues digital credentials, there are several things you can do to make the most of their marketing power.</p> \n<p>Here, we'll cover four areas where incorporating digital badges can help your brand stand out.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h3>1. Social</h3> \n<p>With over <a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/contributors/2019/01/30/digital-trends-2019-every-single-stat-you-need-to-know-about-the-internet/\">3.4 billion</a> active users, there's no denying social media is a modern marketing powerhouse. If your brand doesn't already have a social strategy in place, you're potentially losing out on the opportunity to engage with <em>millions</em> of customers.</p> \n<p>Incorporating digital credentials into your social media strategy can drive brand awareness, increase engagement with the individuals who earn your badges, and strengthen the reputation of your company online.</p> \n<p>To incorporate digital credentials, try using keywords and hashtags to search for individuals sharing your digital credentials online and interact with them — give them a \"Like\", a re-tweet, or congratulate them on their achievement. You'll build stronger connections and create new engagement opportunities with your badge earners.</p> \n<p>For instance, anyone who's earned a HubSpot certification could post it on their LinkedIn, like the example below:</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20to%20Make%20Digital%20Credentials%20Your%20Most%20Impactful%20Marketing%20Tool.png?width=427&amp;name=How%20to%20Make%20Digital%20Credentials%20Your%20Most%20Impactful%20Marketing%20Tool.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 427px;\" width=\"427\">\n</div> \n<p>Connecting with these users over social media in a meaningful way provides an opportunity for every single one of them to become an evangelist for your brand.</p> \n<p>Another way to leverage digital credentials in this way is for employees to share their certifications socially. Think of this as employees promoting company news or recent awards. By sharing achievements on their social channels, your employees are promoting your brand among users you may not have had the chance to get in front of otherwise.</p> \n<h3>2. Email</h3> \n<p>We've already established there is an inordinate number of emails exchanged each day, which means the average person receives multiple emails every hour. Even so, email marketing is still one of the most important and effective ways for your business to connect with customers and build meaningful relationships.</p> \n<p>Since your team is sending emails to people outside your organization, putting digital credentials in employee email signatures drives brand awareness and validation from the moment an email is opened. When your employees' certifications are on display, they work alongside your company logo to reinforce your brand every time an email is sent, forwarded, or replied to.</p> \n<p>Likewise, encourage your external badge earners to add digital credentials to their professional email signatures, too. Credentials help them establish credibility from the moment they hit \"Send\", allows email recipients to instantly verify the digital badge, and helps them learn more about your products and organization in the process.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Hubspot%20Article_Email%20Example.png?width=381&amp;name=Hubspot%20Article_Email%20Example.png\" alt=\"Hubspot Article_Email Example\" width=\"381\" style=\"width: 381px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<h3>3. Online</h3> \n<p>As a marketer, driving quality traffic to your company's site is a core focus. It's the reason there's such importance placed on including backlinks to a website in emails, social media posts, and content.</p> \n<p>The beauty of digital credentials is they're meant to be seen and shared. Developing a dedicated landing page for your digital credentials where potential earners can see the badge associated with the skill is a great way to get visibility for your credentials and is a great place for new earners to start the trial or purchase process. The more people visiting the page, the more recognition you'll have for your initiative.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Hubspot%20Example_Online%20Landing%20Page.png?width=1172&amp;name=Hubspot%20Example_Online%20Landing%20Page.png\" alt=\"Hubspot Example_Online Landing Page\" width=\"1172\" style=\"width: 1172px;\"></p> \n<h3>4. Events</h3> \n<p>Events are a critical marketing initiative because they offer the opportunity to build relationships with key customers and prospects. In an increasingly digital world, many marketers believe face-to-face interactions at events are crucial to generating pipeline. In fact, <a href=\"https://www.marketingcharts.com/customer-centric/lead-generation-and-management-82291\">68% of B2B marketers</a> agree that live events help generate the most leads.</p> \n<p>Since events place a significant focus on generating brand awareness in a sea of industry solutions, you have to ensure your brand stays top-of-mind for attendees.</p> \n<p>Whether it's a job fair or conference, including digital badges at your booth is a great way to encourage conversation and spark questions about your organization's products and programs, as well as your commitment to employee development.</p> \n<p>The visual representation of competencies allows key audiences to see your expertise before they even engage with your team.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Hubspot%20Example_Event%20Flyer.png?width=541&amp;name=Hubspot%20Example_Event%20Flyer.png\" alt=\"Hubspot Example_Event Flyer\" width=\"541\" style=\"width: 541px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<p>Today, having a great product or service is only half the battle. Making sure people know about your organization and how to engage with it is a huge challenge, but also a huge part of brand success. Creating brand awareness won't happen overnight. Using these ideas can help carve out your place in the market and help your brand stand out in no time.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fdigital-credentials&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 11 Aug 2020 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/digital-credentials.jpg#keepProtocol","linkMd5":"ce7b89a71f8f29571df96c8ba23cf23a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn17@2020_5/2020/08/11/1597161322244_a460cba66ceb7f1e.webp","metaImg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/digital-credentials.jpg#keepProtocol","author":"Adam Masur","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20to%20Make%20Digital%20Credentials%20Your%20Most%20Impactful%20Marketing%20Tool.png?width=427&name=How%20to%20Make%20Digital%20Credentials%20Your%20Most%20Impactful%20Marketing%20Tool.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn18@2020_5/2020/08/11/15-55-21-824_f2f3e8a420d8da75.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Hubspot%20Article_Email%20Example.png?width=381&name=Hubspot%20Article_Email%20Example.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn57@2020_3/2020/08/11/15-55-21-901_83fedb2362a96f80.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Hubspot%20Example_Online%20Landing%20Page.png?width=1172&name=Hubspot%20Example_Online%20Landing%20Page.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn97@2020_6/2020/08/11/15-55-21-877_05965a407430c494.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Hubspot%20Example_Event%20Flyer.png?width=541&name=Hubspot%20Example_Event%20Flyer.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn34@2020_2/2020/08/11/15-55-22-003_ca32349614f22d1f.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fdigital-credentials&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn73@2020_3/2020/08/11/1597161321637_8c978c1062e98dd3.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-11 23:55:19","updatedTime":"2020-08-11 23:55:19","title":"How to Create Content for Every Stage of the Buyer's Journey","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-for-every-funnel-stage","description":"<p>No one wakes up in the morning and decides, “I’m going to buy something today.” Instead, they go through a path to purchase that includes research and evaluation before committing to a sales call.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>That journey is called the <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/what-is-the-buyers-journey\">buyer’s journey</a>.

This kicks off their buyer’s journey.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/buyers-journey-3-stages.jpg?width=600&amp;name=buyers-journey-3-stages.jpg\" alt=\"buyer's journey showing progression through the awareness stage, consideration stage, and decision stage\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<p>When you don't have a complete understanding your audience, a disconnect is created between your business and your potential customers. For content marketers, this usually means you're putting out content that your readers don't really relate with, which can cause you to lose them.</p> \n<p>As is the case in all marketing disciplines, it’s <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33491/Everything-Marketers-Need-to-Research-Create-Detailed-Buyer-Personas-Template.aspx#sm.0000o5c3iom8gdkipdw2l236rj19q\">important to understand your audience</a>:&nbsp;how they think, the answers they seek, and the path they tend to take to find a solution. From that research, you can <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-marketing-plan\">begin crafting a documented content strategy</a> that maps your content to the various stages of the buyer's journey.</p> \n<p>Developing the buyer’s journey for your business is the first step to creating content that resonates with your buyer and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33711/The-Steps-You-Need-to-Define-the-Stages-of-Your-Sales-Marketing-Funnel.aspx?&amp;_ga=2.183949606.1430126461.1594683485-303082430.1584047107#sm.0000o5c3iom8gdkipdw2l236rj19q\">building out your marketing funnel</a> so that you can meet them at each stage of their journey.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>What Is a Marketing Funnel?&nbsp;</h2> \n<p>A marketing funnel — more commonly known as a sales funnel since its output is revenue — describes the different stages a customer goes through leading up to their purchase, from looking at your website for the first time and subscribing to your email list to reading your emails and talking to a sales associate.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/attract-engage-delight.jpg?width=787&amp;name=attract-engage-delight.jpg\" alt=\"illustration of marketing funnel with marketing at the top, sales in the middle, and customers at the end. Also shows corresponds to the attract, engage, and delight strategy.\" width=\"787\" style=\"width: 787px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<p>How the funnel works is simple. The top of the funnel indicates they are further away from a purchasing decision while those who make it to the bottom of the funnel are closer to a purchasing decision.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Often, it’s a marketer’s job to <strong>attract</strong> your buyer persona in the early stages of their journey and hand off qualified prospects to the sales team to <strong>engage</strong> them. Once they become a customer, your service team <strong>delights</strong> them so that they buy from you again and again and tell all their friends.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The funnel is a useful tool when used in the context of the buyer’s journey. However, keep in mind that the funnel has one issue: It puts customers as the output. At <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QC2SHjBiag\">INBOUND 18</a>, HubSpot officially <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/our-flywheel\">retires the funnel in favor of the flywheel</a>.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Funnel-To-Flywheel-Morph.gif?width=450&amp;name=Funnel-To-Flywheel-Morph.gif\" alt=\"an animation of the funnel morphing into a flywheel, a circle with marketing, sales, and service surrounded by growth (or customers) at the center\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">The result puts customers at the center, which creates a more unified and less linear approach to all your marketing, sales, and service activities.</img></p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Flywheel-Continuous-Spin.gif?width=400&amp;name=Flywheel-Continuous-Spin.gif\" alt=\"flywheel with attract, engage, and delight, spinning and feeding into each other as it shows strangers becoming prospects, customers, and promoters\" width=\"400\" style=\"width: 400px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<h3>Marketing Funnel Stages</h3> \n<p>Even so, the funnel is still a good starting point before you begin moving to your flywheel strategy.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>All you have to do take the buyer’s journey and ask the question: “How do we attract and engage this person so they become a customer?”&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Whether you subscribe to the funnel or the flywheel methodology, earning business from your prospects comes down to three simple things:&nbsp;</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Attracting strangers</li> \n <li>Engaging prospects</li> \n <li>Delighting customers</li> \n</ul> \n<p>As you create create content that performs these functions, you'll consider the stage they're at in their journey and the best channels to put the content in front of them.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The internet has made it easier for marketers (and salespeople) to engage customers at the various stages of their journey&nbsp;using content marketing.&nbsp;That’s one of the main reasons that<strong><a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/state-of-marketing\"> 60% of marketers</a> consider content as 'very important' or 'extremely important' to their overall strategy.</strong></p> \n<p>However, it can be challenging to create the right content, for the right people, at the right time.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>Marketing Channels for Each Stage of the Funnel</h2> \n<p>Building a content strategy starts with identifying the channels in which you’ll reach your audience.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/marketing-channels-per-stage.jpg?width=600&amp;name=marketing-channels-per-stage.jpg\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" alt=\"marketing channels for each stage of your strategy: attract, engage, delight\" /></p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>Marketing Channels for the Attract Stage</h3> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/attract-stage.jpg?width=600&amp;name=attract-stage.jpg\" alt=\"Attract Stage: The stage of the inbound methodology where you use your expertise to create content and conversations that start meaningful relationships with the right people.\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">Remember, a large majority of your prospects may even be in the awareness stage of their buyer’s journey when you begin to attract them. That means your goal is to solve for their pains/problems by creating content they can easily discover and consume.</img></p> \n<p>At this point, a buyer is trying to solve problems, get an answer, or meet a need. They’re looking for top-level educational content to help direct them to a solution, like blog posts, social content, and ebooks.&nbsp;Their&nbsp;value as a lead is low because there’s no guarantee that they’ll buy from you. But those who find your content helpful and interesting may journey on to the middle of the funnel.</p> \n<p>The ideal channels for your attract stage may include:&nbsp;</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Blogging</li> \n <li>Search Engine Marketing</li> \n <li>Social Media Marketing</li> \n</ul> \n<a></a> \n<h3>Marketing Channels for the Engage Stage</h3> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/engage-stage.jpg?width=600&amp;name=engage-stage.jpg\" alt=\"Engage Stage: The stage of the inbound methodology where you build lasting relationships with people by providing insights and solutions that align with their pain points and goals\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<p>When someone moves into the middle of your funnel, it means you’ve captured their attention. They know they have a problem that has to be solved, and now they’re trying to discover the best solution. The need for a future purchase commitment creeps up as they’re evaluation their options.</p> \n<p>While the top of the funnel is designed to educate a prospect, this is the stage where you want to show why your solutions in particular are the best fit.</p> \n<p>(You also want to help people determine if they're <em>not&nbsp;</em>a good fit, which will be very important later for healthy customer retention. If you convince customers to buy who aren't a good fit for your business in the long run, you could be shooting yourself in the foot in the form of high churn rate later.)</p> \n<p>The middle of the funnel is typically a point of extended engagement where you’re nurturing a lead, building a relationship, and establishing trust between the audience and your brand.</p> \n<p>The ideal channels for your engage stage may include:&nbsp;</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Email Marketing</li> \n <li>Retargeting/Remarketing</li> \n <li>Social Media</li> \n</ul> \n<p>You also need to engage prospects at the bottom of your funnel.</p> \n<p>The bottom of the funnel is where someone is making the actual purchase decision. They're ready to&nbsp;buy, but that&nbsp;still doesn’t guarantee that they’re going to buy from <em>you.</em> That’s the last choice they have to make: Where do they get the solution they’re seeking?</p> \n<p>In most cases, leads at the bottom of your funnel just need that final nudge and that compelling call-to-action to get them to make a purchase decision. The right offer and content at this stage can have a dramatic impact on lifting your conversions.</p> \n<p>You might also consider sales outreach to engage qualified prospects and continue to engage them through personalization and contextual marketing.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>Marketing Channels for the Delight Stage</h3> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/delight-stage.jpg?width=600&amp;name=delight-stage.jpg\" alt=\"Delight Stage: The stage of the inbound methodology where you provide an outstanding experience that adds real value, and empowers people to reach their goals and become promoters of your company.\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<p>Marketing shouldn’t stop once someone becomes a customer. Cultivating a relationship with your customer beyond the sale can lead to higher customer lifetime value as well as word-of-mouth referrals and more.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The key here is to go above and beyond their expectations and provide a customer experience that’s easy and frictionless.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The ideal channels for your delight stage may include:&nbsp;</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Email Marketing</li> \n <li>Retargeting/Remarketing</li> \n <li>Self-Service Channels Such as Knowledge Bases</li> \n <li>Live Chat and Chatbots for Service</li> \n <li>Loyalty Programs</li> \n</ul> \n<p>On the surface, this process seems really linear, but you can also target multiple stages of the buyer’s journey across channels.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>For example, you may still be able to attract someone in the consideration stage or delight someone who isn’t a customer yet. Your knowledge base might convince someone in the consideration stage to buy since they perceive that you have great service, or someone in the awareness stage could engage your chatbot to find the content they need.</p> \n<p>One of the joys of content marketing is thinking outside the box.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>Creating Content for Each Stage of the Buyer's Journey</h2> \n<p>Once you have an idea of who your buyer persona is and what channels will work best for your business, you can begin creating content for your buyer at different stages and tailor that content per channel.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Doing so can help you <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/customer-journey-map-template\">map your content to the relevant stages of the buyer’s journey</a> to make your funnel.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Top of the Funnel:</strong>&nbsp;The \"awareness\" stage, where people looking for answers, resources, education, research data, opinions, and insight.</li> \n <li><strong>Middle of the Funnel:&nbsp;</strong>The \"evaluation\" stage, where people are doing heavy research on whether or not your product or service is a good fit for them.</li> \n <li><strong>Bottom of the Funnel:</strong>&nbsp;The \"purchase\" stage, where people are figuring out exactly what it would take to become a customer.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Your funnel may look very different depending on factors like your industry, business model, product, pricing, and audience.&nbsp;Some B2C customers, for example, spend very little time in the middle of the funnel compared to B2B customers that require far more nurturing, engagement, and relationship development before a purchase is made. A $50 pair of sneakers, for instance, requires a lot less handholding when it comes to making purchase decisions than a $10,000 business software investment.</p> \n<h2>Content Ideas for Each Stage of the Buyer's Journey</h2> \n<p>Because audiences can vary so widely based on industry and intent, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33491/Everything-Marketers-Need-to-Research-Create-Detailed-Buyer-Personas-Template.aspx\">persona research is of the utmost importance</a>. Only by understanding their unique process for awareness and evaluation will you be able to create a truly effective content marketing strategy, packed with custom content that best supports their journey toward making a purchase.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/content-buyer-journey-stage.jpg?width=600&amp;name=content-buyer-journey-stage.jpg\" alt=\"content ideas for each stage of the buyer's journey: awareness, consideration, decision\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>Blog Post&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>A blog post is an ideal piece of content targeting the awareness stage. By targeting a pain, problem, or other topic your target audience wants to discover and then posting it to your website, you’re creating a brand asset that’s crawlable by Google and discoverable by search engine users. You can also promote your blog content across other channels.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/blog-post-example-ahrefs.jpg?width=600&amp;name=blog-post-example-ahrefs.jpg\" alt=\"blog post example from ahrefs's blog that reads 'how long should blog posts be?'\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://ahrefs.com/blog/blog-post-length/\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>Ahrefs is a great example of a brand that does blog content right. They include original data and informational advice to create long-form articles that serve their audience.</p> \n<h3>Social Media Post</h3> \n<p>Social media is a channel that can be used to promote your other content, and you can also create content specifically for the channel. According to <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/fact-sheet/social-media/\">Pew Research</a>, 72% of the public uses some form of social media, so it’s likely that your audience is native to this channel. Unlike blog posts, social media posts are likely shorter form, and <a href=\"https://www.oberlo.com/blog/video-marketing-statistics\">video consumption is also on the rise</a>.</p> \n<iframe style=\"margin: 0px auto; display: block;\" src=\"https://www.linkedin.com/embed/feed/update/urn:li:ugcPost:6672147901583642624\" width=\"504\" height=\"653\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n<p>In the above example, HubSpot Agency Partner <a href=\"https://www.yokellocal.com/\">Yokel Local</a> shares attractive customer marketing tips on the LinkedIn platform. SlideShare formats are popular on LinkedIn, so the content is created to be snackable with short-form take-aways.</p> \n<h3>Whitepaper&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>A whitepaper is an organization’s report or guide on a particular topic. Whitepapers are especially useful as downloadable offers when a reader wants to go more in-depth on a particular subject they’re reading about. For whitepapers, it’s important to provide information that can’t be found elsewhere so that your audience understands the value of the report and is compelled to get it.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/whitepaper-example-hubspot.jpg?width=518&amp;name=whitepaper-example-hubspot.jpg\" alt=\"whitepaper example from hubspot that reads: &quot;not another state of marketing report&quot;\" width=\"518\" style=\"width: 518px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/state-of-marketing\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>Every year, HubSpot publishes a survey on the state of marketing to provide helpful guidance based on thought leadership to marketers, sales professionals, and business owners. Inside, readers find statistics from a broad survey as well as industry experts’ opinions on what the data means and where the industry is going.</p> \n<h3>Checklist&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>For tasks that are complicated and have a lot of moving parts, individuals may simply want a blueprint that spells out what they’re supposed to do to achieve their end goal.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/checklist-example-opendoor.jpg?width=600&amp;name=checklist-example-opendoor.jpg\" alt=\"checklist example from opendoor that reads &quot;the essential checklist for first-time home buyers&quot;\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://www.opendoor.com/w/guides/checklist-for-first-time-home-buyers\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>Buying a home is a perfect example of this, and Opendoor meets their audience’s need by providing a handy checklist (in infographic form!) for the reader that spells out all the steps that need to be taken. The graphic is aesthetically pleasing and even allows room for a few tips along the way.</p> \n<h3>How-To Video&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>Sometimes, the best way to solve a pain or problem is to learn a new skill. Sure, a purchase of some kind may be required along the way, but the audience may need to become more informed about the problem and how to solve it. That’s where instructional video content comes in.</p> \n<div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"width: 100%; height: auto; position: relative; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; max-width: 534px; max-height: 300px; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\"> \n <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.18%; margin: 0;\"> \n  <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/FyOqoV90v58?autoplay=0&amp;fs=0&amp;iv_load_policy=3&amp;showinfo=0&amp;rel=0&amp;cc_load_policy=0&amp;start=0&amp;end=0&amp;origin=https://youtubeembedcode.com\" width=\"534\" height=\"300\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> \n </div> \n</div> \n<p>Whiteboard Fridays is a popular video series by <a href=\"https://moz.com/\">Moz</a> where SEO principles are broken down to the audience in easy-to-understand language and visuals.

In some cases, they may require a little more utility or personalization. That’s why kits and tools are a great piece of content to create to help the reader along their path to purchase.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/tool-example-nerdwallet.jpg?width=600&amp;name=tool-example-nerdwallet.jpg\" alt=\"tool example from nerdwallet that reads &quot;the 50/30/20 budget&quot; and is a budget calculator\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/finance/nerdwallet-budget-calculator\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>Nerdwallet creates content around several financial topics, budgeting being one of them. It can be difficult to create a budget, though, so they developed a calculator that allows the user to provide their own numbers in order to receive a customized recommendation.</p> \n<h3>Ebook or Tip Sheet&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>Similar to whitepapers, ebooks and tip sheets are great options for downloadable content. In contrast, they tend to be shorter form and more actionable.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/tip-sheet-example-coschedule.jpg?width=600&amp;name=tip-sheet-example-coschedule.jpg\" alt=\"tip sheet example from coschedule that reads &quot;180+ power words for writing emotional headlines&quot;\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<p style=\"font-size: 12px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/emotional-headlines/\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>CoSchedule combines a few tactics by promoting their headline analyzer tool with a <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/emotional-headlines/\">blog post about writing great headlines that drive traffic</a>. On that blog post, they include a great <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/emotional-headlines/\">tip sheet of powerful words</a> to include in headlines if you want to catch a reader’s attention.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>Educational Webinar&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>A webinar is a web seminar where information is typically provided through video. A webinar can be prerecorded or streamed live, and this opens up tons of possibilities to disseminate information to an audience who wants more visual and auditory content.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/webinar-example-semrush.jpg?width=600&amp;name=webinar-example-semrush.jpg\" alt=\"semrush's webinar page on their website\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://www.semrush.com/webinars/\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>SEMrush makes webinars a key part of their content marketing strategy, often running a valuable topic multiple times to get more mileage out of the content.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>Product Comparison Guides</h3> \n<p>In the consideration stage, the buyer persona is still considering solutions to their pain or problem. For this reason, product comparisons are a great way to help them make a decision.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/comparison-example-verwell-fit.jpg?width=600&amp;name=comparison-example-verwell-fit.jpg\" alt=\"comparison example from verywell fit that reads &quot;pros and cons of hiit training&quot;\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://www.verywellfit.com/is-hiit-training-or-steady-state-cardio-better-4126506\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>Verywell Fit provides such a comparison to help their readers choose between high-intensity workouts vs. steady-state cardio, providing the pros and cons and use cases for each.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>Case Study</h3> \n<p>A case study can be used in both the consideration stage and the decision stage simultaneously by convincing the reader that the solution works by establishing that the provider achieves results for their clients by administering the solution. A good case study will appeal to the emotions and logic of the persona by providing detailed information and quantitative data on the final solution.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/case-study-example-bluleadz.jpg?width=600&amp;name=case-study-example-bluleadz.jpg\" alt=\"case study example from bluleadz that reads &quot;lead generation strategy lands 77 new clients for credit counseling agency&quot;\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://www.bluleadz.com/case-studies/credit-canada-new-content-offer\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>HubSpot Partner Agency <a href=\"https://www.bluleadz.com/\">Blueleadz</a> does this by telling a story about their client and the problems they had while providing a detailed account of how they solved it.</p> \n<h3>Free Sample&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>A free sample is another example of content or an offer that overlaps between buyer’s journey stages. Consider this: An individual wants to paint the inside of their home, but they don’t know what color.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>As they consider which color (the solution), they pick up paint chip cards from their hardware store. These cards are created by a provider based on their individual solution. When the individual falls in love with a color, they already know who the provider is that makes it.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/free-sample-example-4colorprint.jpg?width=600&amp;name=free-sample-example-4colorprint.jpg\" alt=\"free sample example from 4colorprint that depicts a pack of sample business cards\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<p style=\"font-size: 12px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4colorprint.com/sample-request.php\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>SILKCARDS taps into this buying behavior by offering samples of their unique printing methods on the content that they create. They know that their business is tactile, and digital content alone is not enough to close a deal. Once their prospective customer holds the sample in their hands, other business cards are put to shame.&nbsp;</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>Free Trial or Live Demo</h3> \n<p>What better way to know if you want to purchase a product than take it for a spin? Car dealerships have been using the “test drive” tactic for years because it works. If the product itself checks all the boxes the buyer has, all the sales team has to do is handle their objections and make the close.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/free-trial-example-hellosign.jpg?width=600&amp;name=free-trial-example-hellosign.jpg\" alt=\"free trial example from hellosign that reads &quot;unlimited signature requests with no hidden fees&quot; and has four pricing tiers, one that's free and two that offer free trials\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<p style=\"font-size: 12px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://app.hellosign.com/info/pricing\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>Hellosign does this well. Though they have a free option with limitations, they know that the key to getting clients into their larger tiers is by offering a free trial upfront. Their pricing page sets the prospect’s expectations and points them to the free trial.</p> \n<h3>Consultation Offer&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>A consultation is another example of providing just a little bit of service in exchange for the opportunity to close the sale. The best consultation offers reduce the anxiety of entering into a sales conversation by promising something concrete they can walk away with (a strategy or actionable advice) in exchange for their time.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/consultation-offer-blkbld-co.jpg?width=600&amp;name=consultation-offer-blkbld-co.jpg\" alt=\"consultation offer from blkbld &amp; co that reads 'for our initial consultation, we will discuss what you are looking to do, your budget, my marketing plans you can execute &amp; lastly the next steps&quot;\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<p style=\"font-size: 12px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blkbld.lpages.co/free-consultation/\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>Blk Bld &amp; Co.’s consultation offer is a great example because it reduces the friction of scheduling a consultation. By removing friction, this organization increases the chances of conversion.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>Coupon</h3> \n<p>A coupon appeals to a fear of missing out (FOMO) mindset. By reducing the price by a certain amount, a coupon is handing a price objection while convincing the prospect that they’re leaving money on the table if they don’t use the coupon. This inertia enough to win the prospect’s business.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/coupon-example-fragrant-jewels.jpg?width=500&amp;name=coupon-example-fragrant-jewels.jpg\" alt=\"coupon example from fragrant jewels in a &quot;spin-to-win&quot; style popup format\" width=\"500\" style=\"width: 500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://www.fragrantjewels.com/\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>Fragrant Jewels does this well by gamifying their coupons. By spinning the wheel, the website visitors have the chance to get a coupon before checking out the products. They’ll likely be evaluating the products that are a good deal with the coupon they won.</p> \n<p>In addition to decision stage content, you should also create content to delight your existing customers. This may include FAQ and knowledge base content to make the customer experience easier, coupons for the opportunity to upsell, and additional educative content that deepens their understanding of a topic.</p> \n<h2>Mapping Content Across All Stages of the Funnel and Buying Cycle</h2> \n<p>Every business has a unique sales funnel, sculpted and designed around their buyer’s unique journey.&nbsp;It’s a recipe that can’t necessarily be replicated from one business to another.&nbsp;When creating your own buyer's journey, there are a number of factors specific&nbsp;to your business to take into consideration.</p> \n<p>That said, the general approach remains the same: Understand your audience, develop your funnel around your industry and audience intent, and create a documented content marketing strategy that maps custom content specifically to each phase of their journey through the funnel.</p> \n<p>Do it well, and this process will have the greatest possible impact on your customer relationships, as well as the greatest possible lift in your overall conversions.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p> \n<p><em>Editor's note: This post was originally published in August 2016 and has
