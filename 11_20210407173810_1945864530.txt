It has its own pros/cons just like InnoDB. You need to decide which engine to use based on your application&#8217;s data access patterns.”</em></p>\n<h2>Which Version of MySQL Should I Use?</h2>\n<p>Assuming you have done your research and found MyRocks would be a good fit, the next choice is which version to use.  Facebook runs MyRocks on a heavily patched, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/facebook/mysql-5.6\">internal version of MySQL 5.6</a>.  <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.percona.com/software/mysql-database/percona-server\">Percona Server for MySQL</a> includes MyRocks in both 5.7 and 8.0.  So what are the differences?</p>\n<p>At a high level, the MyRocks/RocksDB code is essentially the same in all three versions.  Percona Server for MySQL uses the upstream version of RocksDB and only changes the linked version when Facebook MySQL updates the version.  This is due to the fact that it inherits the integration testing between RocksDB and MyRocks from Facebook.</p>\n<p>As such, the biggest differences are based solely on the server version and not the server version and MyRocks combination.  If your infrastructure is already running with MySQL 5.7 in production and not ready to finalize a move to 8.0, there would be no discernible difference running the MyRocks engine with your current version.  MyRocks running on Percona Server for MySQL 5.7 is stable and shouldn’t be discarded as an option.  You should still plan to upgrade to 8.0, but there shouldn’t be any unique challenges in the process compared to using InnoDB.  <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.percona.com/blog/2021/04/02/upgrading-to-mysql-8/\">It would just require the standard upgrade process and significant testing.</a></p>\n<p>Moving forward (as 5.7 approaches EOL in 2023), you can expect to see fewer enhancements with MyRocks on Percona Server for MySQL 5.7.  Most new active development will be done against 8.0 while 5.7 will remain primarily in extended support, which includes critical bug fixes and security fixes only.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>With all the version combinations and options, it can be overwhelming to pick the best option for your organization.  For a new deployment, I would recommend starting with MyRocks on MySQL 8.0.  With an existing MySQL 5.7 deployment (while you should be actively working towards an upgrade to 8.0), MyRocks is a viable and stable option as well.  The biggest driver for MyRocks should be space concerns combined with the workload.  As nice as it would be to say MyRocks is the silver bullet that works for everything, that just isn’t the case.  You can always <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.percona.com/services/consulting\">reach out to the Professional Services team at Percona</a> and let us help you determine if MyRocks would be a good fit for your team!</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 06 Apr 2021 05:08:42 +0000","feedId":11,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"2304050d5d78731ffa04bec3bc181d3d","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Mike Benshoof","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Version-of-MySQL-Should-I-Use-for-MyRocks-200x112.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn45@2020_3/2021/04/07/17-37-49-443_ea62b5389d6e2513.webp","https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Version-of-MySQL-Should-I-Use-for-MyRocks-300x168.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn53@2020_5/2021/04/07/17-37-46-325_a049aa45089a993d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617817047588},{"createdTime":"2021-04-08 01:37:27","updatedTime":"2021-04-08 01:37:27","title":"What’s New at Percona Live ONLINE 2021?","link":"https://www.percona.com/blog/?p=75290","description":"<img width=\"200\" height=\"112\" src=\"https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Percona-Live-Generic-200x112.png\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"Percona Live 2021\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"display: block;

a very powerful FreeBSD-based firewall appliance with great features along with a powerful GUI.</p>\n<p>One of the plugins available with OPNSense is  node_exporter, which exposes a lot of operating system metrics through the Prometheus protocol.</p>\n<p>Installing this plugin will allow you to monitor your OPNSense based firewall with any Prometheus-compatible system including, as you have guessed,  <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.percona.com/software/database-tools/percona-monitoring-and-management\">Percona Monitoring and Management</a> (PMM).</p>\n<p>For best results, you will need PMM 2.14 or later, as it has improved support for external exporters.</p>\n<p>Adding OPNSense to PMM for monitoring requires just one simple command:</p>\n<p>&#160;</p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">pmm-admin add external-serverless --url=http://10.11.13.1:9100/metrics --external-name fw01 --group opnsense</pre><p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Let’s break down what this command does:</p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">We are adding this as “serverless” exported because there are no pmm-agent processes running on that node and the only access we have to it is through the Prometheus protocol.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">10.11.13.1 is the IP of the firewall.  Port 9100 is what OPNSense uses by default.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">I chose to name this firewall “fw01” for purpose of monitoring, this is how it will be identified in PMM.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">We put it in the group “opnsense” which will allow us to easily have dashboards that are focused on OPNSense firewalls only, not accidentally picking data from other services.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you prefer, you can also use your PMM installation instead (See PMM -&#62; PMM Add Instance Menu) and pick “External Service”.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-75274 size-large\" src=\"https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/1-1024x735.png\" alt=\"PMM External Service\" width=\"900\" height=\"646\" srcset=\"https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/1-1024x735.png 1024w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/1-300x215.png 300w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/1-200x143.png 200w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/1-1536x1102.png 1536w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/1-367x263.png 367w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/1.png 1999w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>After this step, we will already have some information available in our PMM installation.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-75275 size-large\" src=\"https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2-1024x530.png\" alt=\"PMM dashboard\" width=\"900\" height=\"466\" srcset=\"https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2-1024x530.png 1024w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2-300x155.png 300w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2-200x103.png 200w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2-1536x795.png 1536w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2-367x190.png 367w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2.png 1999w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>The Node Summary Dashboard will pick up some of the OS metrics, however, as this dashboard is built with a focus on Linux rather than FreeBSD, we will not have all data populated or tested to be correct, and this should be seen as a lucky incident rather than an expected outcome.</p>\n<p>The next step you can take is to look if there are any dashboards available for the system you’re looking to monitor.  A quick search <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/9291\">located this dashboard</a> on the Grafana website.</p>\n<p>While this dashboard was a good start, it relied on very particular naming of the hosts in order to work and had some bugs which needed fixing.   If a given dashboard was not designed to work with PMM, you also often need to make some adjustments because PMM applies different labels to the metrics compared to a vanilla Prometheus installation.</p>\n<p>I uploaded an updated dashboard back to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/14150\">Grafana website</a>.</p>\n<p><span>This makes installing it with PMM very easy;
