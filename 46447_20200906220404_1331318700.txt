What bothered this reader was that the three charts were the same size but represented different total values. I’ve already discussed multiple pie charts on this blog; e.g., see “<a title=\"Thinking Outside the Chart Menu\" href=\"http://\" target=\"_blank\">Thinking Outside the Chart Menu</a>.” Today I will point out two other common problems: inconsistent use of color and not considering those with color vision deficiencies.</p> \n<p>Readers of figures with multiple panels often read the legend on the first panel and assume that the legend for the other panels is the same.<img class=\" wp-image-1461 size-full\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/naomirobbins/files/2015/03/JerPost1-e1426778647864.jpg\" alt=\"JerPost1\" width=\"606\" height=\"424\" /><img class=\" wp-image-1459 size-full\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/naomirobbins/files/2015/03/JerPost2-e1426778704744.jpg\" alt=\"JerPost2\" width=\"606\" height=\"424\" /></p> \n<div id=\"attachment_1460\" style=\"width: 616px\" class=\"wp-caption\">\n <img class=\"wp-image-1460 size-full\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/naomirobbins/files/2015/03/JerPost3-e1426778749595.jpg\" alt=\"Figures from the Jerusalem Post\" width=\"606\" height=\"424\" />\n <p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Source: http://www.jpost.com/Israel-Elections/Analysis-The-Israel-election-decided-by-one-vote-394229</p>\n</div> \n<p>In the top panel titled “National unity government,” green represents the Zionist Union party. If we then look at the middle panel titled “Right wing government,” green represents The Bayit Yehudi party. &nbsp;Finally, in the bottom panel titled “Herzog-led government, green represents the Kulanu party. Another way to describe this problem is to notice that Kulanu is blue in the top panel orange in the middle one, and green in the bottom panel. This is likely to cause some readers to be confused or misled.</p> \n<p>Another color problem with these figures is that some colors will not be distinguishable to those with the most common forms of color vision deficiencies.
