Foreign, domestic, independent, big budget: What better way to hone your skills as a thoughtful moviegoer than by deconstructing these little pieces of advertising?</em></p>\n<p>This week, we go by our house in the middle of the street, forget about college, learn about the universe, and discover a different type of talk show.<br />\n<span id=\"more-669975\"></span></p>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4-CFpCQbIek?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<h2><strong>Holler</strong></h2>\n<p>Director <strong>Nicole Riegel</strong> is not here to tell a tale of your usual teen.</p>\n<blockquote><p>In a forgotten pocket of Southern Ohio where American manufacturing and opportunities are drying up, a determined young woman finds a ticket out when she is accepted to college. Alongside her older brother, Ruth Avery joins a dangerous scrap metal crew in order to pay her way. Together, they spend one brutal winter working the scrap yards during the day and stealing valuable metal from the once thriving factories at night. With her goal in sight, Ruth finds that the ultimate cost for an education for a girl like her may be more than she bargained for, and she soon finds herself torn between a promising future and the family she would leave behind.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The way we&#8217;re introduced to our teenage protagonist is amazing. There is no build-up, no sassy soundtrack, and none of the usual conventions pitting them against the world. It&#8217;s simply the <em>actual</em> world in all its heinous reality. What this trailer does so very well is create a world where the hopes and dreams of childhood and adolescence inter-mesh with the cold day-to-day responsibilities of life once school is no longer a constant. Depending on where you live, it can be brutal. This brutality can spill into anyone&#8217;s life but when you&#8217;re young, and you still have shreds of hope, the story can either end happily or end in tragedy. Parts of America, right now, are ending more in the latter.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XKoLOg-9Byk?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<h2><strong>Before We Was We: Madness by Madness</strong></h2>\n<p>Directors <strong>Bill Jones </strong>and <strong>Ben Timlett</strong> certainly were fans first.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Before We Was We: Madness by Madness is an enthralling slice of music history, featuring original footage and interviews with Madness band members past and present including Chris Foreman, Mike “Barso” Barson, Lee “Thommo” Thompson, Graham “Suggs” McPherson, Daniel “Woody” Woodgate, Mark “Bedders” Bedford, Carl “Chas Smash” Smyth, regaling stories from their 40-year career together as Madness. Set during a time of cultural and political upheaval, the docuseries offers a captivating insight into a post-war Britain, which has changed beyond recognition alongside the band’s inevitable rise to the top of the charts, pop fame and fortune against the backdrop of the ska, punk and new wave revolution.</p>\n<p>The docuseries traces the humble beginnings of the band that would go on to set the record for the biggest audience ever for the BBC’s Live New Year’s Eve Broadcast – the most watched TV music event of 2018, and perform on top of Buckingham Palace as part of the Queen’s Jubilee celebrations. Throughout their career, Madness have had 10 UK top ten albums, 15 top ten singles and have won a multitude of awards including a prestigious Ivor Novello. And the story isn’t over yet.</p></blockquote>\n<p>There are probably some out there who have forgotten that Madness&#8217; &#8220;<em>Our House</em>&#8221; was a Top-40 hit that was played on commercial radio in the early 80s. The video still resonates with olds like me, and I fully acknowledge that there are tens of thousands who wouldn&#8217;t know or care too much about what happened with this band after this song faded from airplay. A one-hit-wonder to some, a band who would influence dozens of bands to others, Madness certainly was, and is, musical royalty in the UK.</p>\n<p>The trailer hits the usual trappings of showing how the band came together, capturing what it was like at that moment when they were at their peak, but it also shows how that downside affected them as well. Knowing that this is a three-hour romp into the back personal catalog of this band is incredible. As an aficionado of Ska myself, I can still hear their influence today on bands just finding their own rhythm.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/20a-CpuVIfo?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<h2><strong>Emily @ the Edge of Chaos</strong></h2>\n<p>Director<strong> Wendy Apple</strong> is no longer with us, but she would be proud of this effort.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Emily @ the Edge of Chaos interweaves Emily Levine&#8217;s live performance with animation, appearances by scientists, and animated characters (John Lithgow as Sir Isaac Newton, Lily Tomlin as Ayn Rand, Leonard Nimoy as Sigmund Freud, Richard Lewis as Aristotle, Matt Groening as Aldo Leopold). The film uses physics, which explains how the universe works, to explain our metaphysics &#8212; the story of our values, our institutions, our interactions. Using her own experience and a custom blend of insight and humor, provocation and inspiration, personal story and social commentary, Emily takes her audience through its own paradigm shift: from the Fear of Change to the Edge of Chaos.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This is something a little different. It&#8217;s something exciting that, much like Derek DelGaudio&#8217;s one-man show<em> In &#38; Of Itself</em>, plays with convention. We&#8217;re used to being spoken to when there&#8217;s a one-person show. Usually, the stage is sparse; the person giving their performance stands against something that isn&#8217;t distracting; and, there is a complete focus on the presenter. With everything happening here, it&#8217;s tough to focus on any one thing. It&#8217;s probably why I like it so much. The trailer feels like <em>Sesame Street</em> for adults and it&#8217;s so soothing. Emily Levine, unfortunately, also passed away, so this feels like a coda to her life that she wanted to pass on. You can quibble all you like on the fuddy-duddy-ness of who this might appeal to, but it doesn&#8217;t really matter. She seemed like a delightful human being who wanted to share her knowledge, and I&#8217;m more than happy to receive it.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qVj--VYe52c?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<h2>Pause With Sam Jay</h2>\n<p>This looks to give the world a different take on the late-night scene.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Co-created by Jay with Insecure‘s showrunner/director Prentice Penny, Pause takes the traditional late-night talk show format and spins it on its head, with Jay hosting a lively party in her apartment each week. Episodes will center on Jay and her guest discussing current events and topics, like Covid-19 and racial justice, and their conversations will be broken up with additional interviews, sketches, and animation. The trailer gives a fast-paced look at the vibe of the show, filled with lively debates around Jay’s kitchen and living room.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know if this will endure as long as the much-ballyhooed shows for all the other mediocre, predictable, scripted, and downright safe talk shows out there, but I&#8217;m down. This feels fresh, looks like it has something to say, and it appears to change the game up a little bit. With there being so much white noise on television, pun intended, I can&#8217;t see this achieving critical mass, but I&#8217;m inspired that someone is out there taking swings at giants who are all too content with being bland as hell.</p>\n<p><em style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">Nota bene: If you have any suggestions of trailers for possible inclusion in this column, even have a trailer of your own to pitch, please let me know by sending me a note at Christopher_Stipp@yahoo.com or look me up via Twitter at @Stipp</em></p>\n<div>\n<p>In case you missed them, here are the other trailers we covered at /Film this week:</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-last-letter-from-your-lover-trailer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>The Last Letter From Your Lover Trailer</strong></a> &#8211;

It was an unexpected leap for both of the actors, but we&#8217;re even more floored by the Pam and Tommy first look photos that series co-star <strong>Seth Rogen</strong> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Sethrogen\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">posted to social media</a> this weekend.

That&#8217;s impressive. Admittedly, Sebastian Stan&#8217;s face gives him away, even with the trashy goatee and guyliner in place. But Lily James looks like the spitting image of Pamela Anderson. Honestly, when I saw that black and white photo on the right, I thought someone had Photoshopped Sebastian Stan&#8217;s face onto a real photo of Tommy Lee with Pamela Anderson. It&#8217;s practically impossible to see Lily James here, and that&#8217;s certainly because of the make-up department working on this series.</p>\n<p>Sebastian Stan also posted another image of himself as Tommy Lee <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/COlvqEhrTgx/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">on Instagram</a>:</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-670474 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/pamandtommy-firstlook-stan-car-700x394.jpg\" alt=\"Pam and Tommy First Look Photos\" width=\"700\" height=\"394\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/pamandtommy-firstlook-stan-car.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/pamandtommy-firstlook-stan-car-360x203.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>For those unfamiliar, one of the most talked about couples of the late 1990s was Pamela Anderson (a Playboy Playmate and actress famous for Baywatch) and Tommy Lee (the drummer of rock band Mötley Crüe). After getting married just 96 hours after meeting each other, their relationship was a constant attention grabber and the tabloids loved them. Their relationship was thrust into the spotlight in a far more intimate way when a sex tape that the two filmed during their honeymoon was stolen and leaked to the public. This was before the internet allowed it to easily spread far and wide, so it spread the old-fashioned way on video tape.</p>\n<p>As for the man who stole the tape, that was electrician Rand Gauthier, and that&#8217;s who Seth Rogen is playing:</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-670470 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/pamandtommy-firstlook-sethrogen-intrailer-700x926.jpg\" alt=\"Pam and Tommy First Look Photos\" width=\"700\" height=\"926\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/pamandtommy-firstlook-sethrogen-intrailer.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/pamandtommy-firstlook-sethrogen-intrailer-360x476.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Yep, that certainly looks like someone who would steal a sex tape and try to get rich by illegally selling it. The scandal of the tape in question will be part of the Pam and Tommy series on Hulu, but the series will also dive into  the early stages of the couple’s romance and their time in the spotlight before the tape emerged.</p>\n<p><em>Pam and Tommy</em> will also star <strong>Nick Offerman</strong>, <strong>Taylor Schilling</strong>, <strong>Andrew Dice Clay</strong>, <strong>Pepi Sonuga</strong>, <strong>Spencer Granese</strong>, and <strong>Mozhan Marnò</strong>. Directing and executive producing will be <strong>Craig Gillespie</strong> (<em>I, Tonya</em>) with a script from <strong>Rob Siegel</strong> (<em>The Wrestler</em>, <em>The Founder</em>).

Legendary will make a <em>Faces of Death</em> reimagining with <strong>Isa Mazzei</strong> and <strong>Daniel Goldhaber</strong>, the team behind the indie horror movie <em>Cam</em>. The story involves a YouTube moderator who discovers a group of people recreating the deaths from the original movie.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-670445\"></span></p>\n<p>If you grew up in the era of video stores, you probably know all about <em>Faces of Death</em> – even if you never rented a copy. The VHS cover art was designed to shock and titillate, featuring a leering skull and boasting a claim that the film was &#8220;banned in 40+ countries!&#8221; It gained infamy as something akin to a snuff film, but here&#8217;s the twist: most of the death in the movie was fake, staged with make-up effects. And while the film was banned in some places, it definitely was <em>not</em> banned in 40+ countries. It was all a rouse to make <em>Faces of Death</em> all the more shocking, and thus more appealing to the morbidly curious.</p>\n<p>Written and directed by John Alan Schwartz, the original film took the form of a faux-documentary where a pathologist named Francis B. Gröss (played by actor Michael Carr) presents the audience with a cavalcade of disturbing footage showing different gruesome ways of death, from various sources. While there were a few bits of genuine footage in the film – there&#8217;s the aftermath of a deadly car accident that&#8217;s real, for instance – the bulk of the movie consists of staged moments.</p>\n<p>That didn&#8217;t matter, though. As the saying goes, &#8220;When the legend becomes fact, print the legend.&#8221; And the legend of <em>Faces of Death</em> far outweighed its actual content. The cult appeal was so much that several sequels were spawned – <em>Faces of Death II</em> (1981), <em>Faces of Death III</em> (1985), <em>The Worst of Faces of Death</em> (1987), <em>Faces of Death IV</em> (1990), <em>Faces of Death V</em> (1995) <em>Faces of Death VI</em> (1996).</p>\n<p>Now, Legendary wants to turn this whole idea into a feature film. Per <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/faces-of-death-legendary-remake-1234949947/\">THR</a>, producers Susan Montford and Don Murphy of Angry Films are working with Isa Mazzei and Daniel Goldhaber, the team behind <em>Cam</em>, on a film that will &#8220;revolve around a female moderator of a YouTube-like website, whose job is to weed out offensive and violent content and who herself is recovering from a serious trauma, that stumbles across a group that is recreating the murders from the original film. But in the story primed for the digital age and age of online misinformation, the question faced is are the murders real or fake?&#8221;</p>\n<p>Mazzei will direct and Goldhaber will handle the script. The story of the film comes from Mazzei, Goldhaber, and <strong>Isabelle Link-Levy</strong>. And believe it or not, this isn&#8217;t the first time Hollywood tried to dip into <em>Faces of Death</em>. Back in 2006, producers Murphy and Montford (along with Rick Benattar) announced they were remaking <em>Faces of Death</em>, and brought on filmmaker J.T. Petty. Petty helmed the excellent faux-documentary <em>S&#38;MAN</em> (pronounced <em>Sandman</em>), in which Petty investigates the world of underground horror and discovers someone who may be making <em>real</em> snuff films. Based on <em>S&#38;MAN</em>, Petty seemed like a pretty great choice to helm <em>Faces of Death</em>, but that version never came together. Now, it&#8217;s time to try again. And I&#8217;m interested! I kind of dig that plot synopsis, and I&#8217;m curious to see how this one pans out.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/faces-of-death-reimagining/\">&#8216;Faces of Death&#8217; Reimagining Will Turn the Cult Faux-Documentary Into a Modern-Day Horror Movie</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=MCaTa2PVTeI:H_ygyaP1aEI:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=MCaTa2PVTeI:H_ygyaP1aEI:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=MCaTa2PVTeI:H_ygyaP1aEI:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=MCaTa2PVTeI:H_ygyaP1aEI:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=MCaTa2PVTeI:H_ygyaP1aEI:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=MCaTa2PVTeI:H_ygyaP1aEI:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/MCaTa2PVTeI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 07 May 2021 22:00:00 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Faces-of-Death-Reimagining-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"171b8bd7ce2f7298d265710006b0d1b5","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn32@2020_2/2021/05/09/14-16-08-042_298541d60db983a2.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":23669,"destBytes":15384,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Faces-of-Death-Reimagining-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn32@2020_2/2021/05/09/14-16-08-042_298541d60db983a2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn96@2020_2/2021/05/09/14-16-08-991_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=MCaTa2PVTeI:H_ygyaP1aEI:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn94@2020_6/2021/05/09/14-16-08-989_e1f511b6adbab200.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn24@2020_1/2021/05/09/14-16-09-490_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=MCaTa2PVTeI:H_ygyaP1aEI:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn60@2020_2/2021/05/09/14-16-09-400_68c46b1995ad6f7f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/MCaTa2PVTeI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn21@2020_5/2021/05/09/14-16-08-627_b73e20f008670f7a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1620569753475},{"createdTime":"2021-05-09 22:15:53","updatedTime":"2021-05-09 22:15:53","title":"New ‘Mission: Impossible 7’ Photos: Tom Cruise Has a Train to Catch (and a Dirt Bike to Ride)","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=670477","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-670481 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/missionimpossible7-tomcruise-locomotive-empire-frontpage-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"New Mission: Impossible 7 Photos\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/missionimpossible7-tomcruise-locomotive-empire-frontpage.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/missionimpossible7-tomcruise-locomotive-empire-frontpage-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Last month, we learned that <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/top-gun-maverick-release-date-shift/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">we&#8217;ll be waiting a lot longer</a> to see <strong><em>Mission: Impossible 7</em></strong> in theaters. The sequel starring <strong>Tom Cruise</strong> was pushed back from the previously set November 2021 release to a summer date in <strong>May 2022</strong>. Thankfully, we&#8217;ve got a little bit of a tease to hold us over with a few new photos from the set, including Tom Cruise on a big steaming locomotive and speeding around on a dirt bike. Get a look at the new <em>Mission: Impossible 7</em> photos below.<span id=\"more-670477\"></span></p>\n<p>When <em>Mission: Impossible 7</em> was shooting last fall, some footage of Tom Cruise shooting a sequence on top of a moving train made its way online. Fans on a train passing by the production caught the actor just hanging out on the train in between shots, and now we have an official shot of Cruise with the train in question, but it&#8217;s far more casual.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-670482 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/missionimpossible7-tomcruise-locomotive-empire-full-700x467.jpg\" alt=\"New Mission: Impossible 7 Photos\" width=\"700\" height=\"467\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/missionimpossible7-tomcruise-locomotive-empire-full-700x467.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/missionimpossible7-tomcruise-locomotive-empire-full-360x240.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/missionimpossible7-tomcruise-locomotive-empire-full-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/missionimpossible7-tomcruise-locomotive-empire-full.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/tom-cruise-mission-impossible-7-saving-cinema/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Empire Magazine</a> debuted the new photo in a cover story that was likely meant to have more hype for the sequel. But now that the movie has been pushed back six months, the story is pretty much just about the difficult of getting production back on track during the coronavirus pandemic. Tom Cruise talked about how much work went into make the production as safe as possible, and it <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/mission-impossible-7-tom-cruise-robots/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">didn&#8217;t involve any terrifying robots</a> patrolling the set. The magazine explained:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;<span class=\"jsx-3852935145 content\">There was social distancing, there were masks, there were bubbles of crew members – one make-up artist for every two actors, plus heads of departments staying in hotel rooms on their own, driving to set, shooting the scene and then returning to the hotel until needed – and pods of five people, ready to quarantine if anyone within one contracted the virus.</span>&#8220;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Cruise was determined to pull off this production in the face of the coronavirus pandemic. The actor said, &#8220;We had to create protocols with studios and insurance companies, and work on laws in each country, assuring them how we were going to film in the country. There were times when people said, ‘It’s not going to happen.’ And I just kept saying, ‘It’s happening.’&#8221; Yeah, that sounds like the Tom Cruise we know and love.</p>\n<p>What makes <em>Mission: Impossible 7</em> even more challenging is figuring out how to pull of all the insane stunts that are staples of the franchise now. It makes planning much more intense, especially when one of the stunts involves driving a motorbike off a cliffside, jumping off of it and releasing a parachute.

It was only a few years ago that Syfy announced the network would be making the long-in-the-works <em>Killer Klowns</em> sequel, but in a recent interview, director <strong>Stephen Chiodo</strong> explained exactly why that version of the movie fell apart before it really got going.<span id=\"more-670400\"></span></p>\n<p>Speaking on <a href=\"https://www.slasherradio.com/episode-180-special-guest-killer-klowns-from-outer-space-director-stephen-chiodo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Slasher Radio</a> (via <a href=\"https://movieweb.com/killer-klowns-from-outer-space-2-why-didnt-happen-syfy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Movieweb</a>) earlier this week, Stephen Chiodo – one third of the beloved Chiodo Brothers, the trio of siblings who are masters of low-budget special effects – talked about why the most recent planned iteration of the sequel didn&#8217;t happen. It was supposed to be called <em>The Return of the Killer Klowns From Outer Space in 3D</em>, but it turns out Syfy didn&#8217;t want to sufficiently invest in making it:</p>\n<p>&#8220;There was a deal,&#8221; Chiodo said. &#8220;MGM controls the rights&#8230;and they went to SYFY. They <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/killer-klowns-from-outer-space-and-critters-remakes-at-syfy/\">did</a> [2019&#8217;s] <em>Critters</em> [<em>Attack!</em>], and you saw what that turned out to be like. But they wanted to do <em>Klowns</em> for like two million [dollars]. And we don&#8217;t want to do that&#8230;we did it for two million back in the &#8217;80s. So we didn&#8217;t want to do it. And even MGM didn&#8217;t want to do it&#8230;they said it was a more valuable property than just signing off for that little money.&#8221;</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cVQ3AGzeB_0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>The original <em>Killer Klowns From Outer Space</em> is an example of what I call a pure cult movie. It has a real personal touch to it, and there&#8217;s a palpable feeling that this is genuinely interesting and entertaining to the Chiodos, as opposed to more ironic modern cult films that can sometimes feel a bit more designed to generate a certain type of response from audiences. This one feels as if every single dollar of its two million dollar budget made its way onto the screen, giving the bizarre costumes and creature effects and visual effects as much oomph as they could muster. I don&#8217;t blame them for not wanting to make a sequel for the same amount of money they had in &#8217;88.</p>\n<p>But according to Chiodo, it sounds like the most effective way fans can help get a sequel made is to <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/sequel-bits-93/\">let MGM know that they want one</a>. Somehow I doubt that the <em>Killers Klowns</em> fanbase is big enough to be able to convince a studio to spend big money on a follow-up all these years later, but I&#8217;d love to be proven wrong about that. (And please, fans: don&#8217;t harass anyone at MGM about this. Maybe just tweet at the studio&#8217;s account once and move on.)</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/killer-klowns-sequel-woes/\">&#8216;Killer Klowns From Outer Space 2&#8217;: Here&#8217;s Why the Sequel Hasn&#8217;t Happened Yet</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=YSCCIa376mc:c2xp0i9ig6A:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=YSCCIa376mc:c2xp0i9ig6A:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=YSCCIa376mc:c2xp0i9ig6A:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=YSCCIa376mc:c2xp0i9ig6A:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=YSCCIa376mc:c2xp0i9ig6A:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=YSCCIa376mc:c2xp0i9ig6A:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/YSCCIa376mc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 07 May 2021 22:30:03 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/quarantine-stream-killer-klowns-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"c9fd9684425174eb8628eafc2248b61c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn30@2020_3/2021/05/09/14-16-05-843_4e08f7325756cfcf.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":49977,"destBytes":38342,"author":"Ben Pearson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/quarantine-stream-killer-klowns-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn30@2020_3/2021/05/09/14-16-05-843_4e08f7325756cfcf.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn96@2020_2/2021/05/09/14-16-08-991_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=YSCCIa376mc:c2xp0i9ig6A:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn1@2020_6/2021/05/09/14-16-08-633_1a4035bec6e86b53.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn24@2020_1/2021/05/09/14-16-09-490_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=YSCCIa376mc:c2xp0i9ig6A:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn12@2020_4/2021/05/09/14-16-09-078_f254032dcd98c109.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/YSCCIa376mc":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn71@2020_5/2021/05/09/14-16-08-955_d0fb7317a4e34fe7.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1620569753475},{"createdTime":"2021-05-09 22:15:53","updatedTime":"2021-05-09 22:15:53","title":"John Krasinski and Emily Blunt Battling Paramount Over ‘A Quiet Place Part II’ Paydays","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=670417","description":"<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-600864 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/A-Quiet-Place-Part-II-Super-Bowl-Spot-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"A Quiet Place Part 2 paydays\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/A-Quiet-Place-Part-II-Super-Bowl-Spot-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/A-Quiet-Place-Part-II-Super-Bowl-Spot-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/A-Quiet-Place-Part-II-Super-Bowl-Spot-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/A-Quiet-Place-Part-II-Super-Bowl-Spot.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>When Warner Bros. announced that every one of its 2021 releases would be dropped day and date on HBO Max, several high profile directors and actors did not react well to that news because it impacted the amount of money they could make based on a film&#8217;s theatrical performance. Fast forward several months, and a similar conversation is happening again, this time at Paramount.</p>\n<p><strong>John Krasinski</strong> and <strong>Emily Blunt</strong>, the creative forces involved in <em><strong>A Quiet Place Part II</strong></em>, are in a battle with the studio over their paydays for the upcoming sequel, which will likely be significant impacted by Paramount&#8217;s decision to put its new films on the new Paramount+ streaming service just 45 days after it debuts.<span id=\"more-670417\"></span></p>\n<p>In February, Paramount <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/a-quiet-place-2-and-mission-impossible-7-on-paramount/\">announced</a> that it plans to put big movies like <em>Mission: Impossible 7</em> and <em>Top Gun: Maverick</em> on its new streaming service 45 days after they&#8217;re released in theaters, instead of keeping the typical 90 day window intact. That decision also applies to <em>A Quiet Place Part II</em>, and a new report from <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-06/-a-quiet-place-stars-emily-blunt-john-krasinski-want-more-money-from-paramount\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bloomberg</a> says that Krasinski, the film&#8217;s writer and director, and Blunt, its primary star, are not thrilled about it.</p>\n<p>Their contract is directly tied to the movie&#8217;s box office performance – which, in a non-pandemic time, would be great for them, considering the 2018 original became a huge hit, making $341 million on a $20 million budget. But with some movie theaters still restricting their capacities, and audiences not back in the habit of visiting movie theaters in person, they fear that people will just wait the 45 days and see it on Paramount+, which would majorly impact the amount of money they would make.

What would the Danish actor&#8217;s take on the dark wizard look like? Would we finally be rid of the bad bleach job? Mikkelsen has <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/how-grindelwald-will-be-taken-over-by-mads-mikkelsen-in-fantastic-beasts-3/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">spoken before</a> about how he&#8217;ll take a (respectfully) different approach from Depp, but he elaborated further on how he plans to make this part his &#8220;own.&#8221;</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-670327\"></span></p>\n<p>Mikkelsen will be playing the role of the dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald in the upcoming third film in the <strong><em>Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them</em></strong> franchise, taking over from Depp, who played the villain in the first two films. While he&#8217;s joked before that his version will naturally be different because &#8220;it&#8217;s going to be me, so that’s a difference,&#8221; Mikkelsen recently spoke with <a href=\"https://collider.com/fantastic-beasts-3-mads-mikkelsen-johnny-depp-comments/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Collider</a> about why he felt it was necessary to develop his own take on Grindelwald:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Nobody’s interested in me going in there and trying to copy anything, that would be creative suicide immediately, especially when it’s been done before and masterfully. So everybody’s expecting us to find a different path. Having said that, we need a bridge between what he did and what I’m gonna do, so those bridges you have to find together, whether it’s a certain look, whether it’s a certain attitude in certain situations, but you have to make it your own. Anything else would be plainly just creatively stupid.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Naturally, Mikkelsen didn&#8217;t go into details about how different his approach will be, but we can probably expect it will be something along the lines of his villains in <em>Hannibal, Casino Royale,</em> or <em>Doctor Strange</em>. If it&#8217;s anything like the highly charged homoeroticism of Hannibal Lecter, we&#8217;d be blessed, honestly (<em>Fantastic Beasts</em> is severely lacking in sexually charged tension between Grindelwald and Jude Law&#8217;s Dumbledore, whose characters were supposed to have had an intimate relationship at one point).</p>\n<p>Mikkelsen enters the series at a complicated time for <em>Fantastic Beasts</em> and <em>Harry Potter</em>. The franchise is mired in controversy, due to the transphobic statements by author J.K. Rowling, as well as the allegations of abuse against Depp during his thorny divorce from Amber Heard. But Mikkelsen, fresh off the Oscar-winning <em>Another Round</em>, offers a kind of blank slate for the film series, as well as a new perspective. He told Collider that he joined the franchise because of the opportunity to do the kind of film that doesn&#8217;t get made in his home country of Denmark.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I’m a big fan of the Potter universe, and it’s a kind of genre that you don’t touch upon in my part of the world. You can’t get away with that budget-wise in Denmark, so obviously when it came my way it was a fantastic opportunity,&#8221; Mikkelsen said.</p>\n<p><em>Fantastic Beasts 3</em> is currently in production in the United Kingdom and is slated to hit theaters on <strong>July 14, 2022</strong>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/mads-mikkelsen-grindelwald-fantastic-beasts-3/\">Mads Mikkelsen Plans to Make Grindelwald His &#8220;Own&#8221; After Replacing Johnny Depp in &#8216;Fantastic Beasts 3&#8217;</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=EkQPHfSK5AY:iUpcYggxnuY:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=EkQPHfSK5AY:iUpcYggxnuY:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=EkQPHfSK5AY:iUpcYggxnuY:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=EkQPHfSK5AY:iUpcYggxnuY:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=EkQPHfSK5AY:iUpcYggxnuY:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=EkQPHfSK5AY:iUpcYggxnuY:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/EkQPHfSK5AY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 07 May 2021 19:00:47 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/hannibal-season-4-mads-mikkelsen-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"8020ed95e62eb371da2f4914aace72e9","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn15@2020_3/2021/05/09/14-15-53-789_ad1fa8969df378f5.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":31890,"destBytes":20328,"author":"Hoai-Tran Bui","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/hannibal-season-4-mads-mikkelsen-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn15@2020_3/2021/05/09/14-15-53-789_ad1fa8969df378f5.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn96@2020_2/2021/05/09/14-16-08-991_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=EkQPHfSK5AY:iUpcYggxnuY:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn38@2020_1/2021/05/09/14-16-08-666_209a824b05e4c92e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn24@2020_1/2021/05/09/14-16-09-490_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=EkQPHfSK5AY:iUpcYggxnuY:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn15@2020_6/2021/05/09/14-16-08-664_1eb7164053626c58.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/EkQPHfSK5AY":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn86@2020_3/2021/05/09/14-16-08-632_2ec962e29504a655.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1620569753475},{"createdTime":"2021-05-09 22:15:53","updatedTime":"2021-05-09 22:15:53","title":"‘Returnal’ is a Thrilling, Frustrating Science Fiction Video Game That’s Like Playing ‘Edge of Tomorrow’ Inside ‘Prometheus’","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=670083","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-670358 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Returnal-Review-700x300.jpeg\" alt=\"Returnal Review\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Returnal-Review.jpeg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Returnal-Review-360x154.jpeg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s hard to believe, but true – gaming is still in its infancy. Or at least it&#8217;s teenage years. Sometime over the last decade, a brand-new genre dubbed &#8220;Roguelike” has emerged, and new release (and PlayStation 5 exclusive) <em><strong>Returnal</strong></em> falls under this label. And it could be loved or loathed, depending on personal taste and preferences. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s also a genre foreign to many mainstream gamers. Sure, independent titles such as <em>Hades</em> and <em>The Binding of Isaac</em> have racked up consumer and industry awards, but it’s still fresh enough to where passionate gamers such as me have never gotten around to playing one. Housemarque (known for more minor, arcadey PlayStation exclusives like <em>Super Stardust HD</em> and <em>Resogun</em>) feel it&#8217;s time to popularize the style, but can something so hardcore find broad appeal?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The answer is yes and no, but with specifics remaining unearthed following whatever data comes from this AAA experiment.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"more-670083\"></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For those unaware of what Roguelike means: once you die, you respawn back at the beginning. Of course, individual development studios have their variations, but here in <em>Returnal</em>, failing results in starting over with only plot-centric items/abilities remaining in your possession (a nifty melee sword, a grappling hook for traversal, etc.). Further disorienting the player, the environments, battles, and item locations are randomized. To be fair, that&#8217;s highly fitting since <em>Returnal</em> also doubles as third-person survival horror.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ignoring orders from her superiors and inexplicably being drawn to a broadcast labeled &#8220;White Shadow,&#8221; space explorer Seline crash lands her vessel Helios (a name crucial to understanding the story) on fictional planet Atropos. She finds herself in a calm forest pulsating with bright colors radiating from alien lifeforms, and these early moments show off the PlayStation 5 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_tracing_(physics)\">ray tracing</a> capabilities, demonstrating arguably the most impressive lighting in a game to date. But there is also a profoundly haunting and existential vibe. Soon, Seline comes across her own dead body, and she quickly realizes she is stuck in a time loop.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>Returnal</em>&#8216;s goal then becomes to reach that mysterious broadcast at any cost. Scattered throughout the randomly generated locales are audio logs that speak to a combination of things; the mental state of Seline alongside some traumatic backstory, her descent into madness from repeating the time loop, and assessments from alien lifeforms who also clearly went mad while seeking something from a higher being. Spookily, there&#8217;s also a 20th century home that can be returned to and explored upon making critical game progress. This is also where the brunt of the mystery is uncovered. Yes, that means if you do rush to the ending, you will finish <em>Returnal</em>, but it&#8217;s likely to not make any sense.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With that in mind, player repetition is rewarded. Whether or not the average gamer will put up with repeating sections over and over (with alterations) to both dig more into the story and hone their skills is a coin flip. Admittedly, <em>Returnal</em> is not my kind of game, as I&#8217;ve never been the type to enjoy punishing difficulty for the sake of bragging rights. Value should never be defined by length or time consumption, so the genre by default is going to be off-putting toward many casual gamers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here&#8217;s what tips the scale in favor of <em>Returnal</em>: it&#8217;s an exhilarating gameplay experience through each cycle. The third-person shooter mechanics are tossed into a blender with the studio&#8217;s knack for bullet-hell insanity (think of your character as a spaceship trying to dodge hundreds of asteroids simultaneously soaring your way), with moves such as thruster dashing, quicktime reloads that grants additional ammunition, alternative modes of fire for each weapon (the haptic feedback on the controller comes into play here with the L2 aim function operating differently depending on how deep it&#8217;s held down), and a boatload of artifacts, parasites, and unique (sometimes dangerous) item drops that offer a combination of positive and negative side effects. It&#8217;s reasonable to say that fortuitous luck of the draw with randomly generated upgrades could make the game significantly easier for the most inexperienced gamers should they continue to plug away. Grinding weapon experience upgrades and currency to purchase revival items upon death is also encouraged.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bosses are also massive monstrosities broken up into three endurance testing phases. <em>Returnal</em> draws inspiration from Ridley Scott&#8217;s <em>Alien</em> and <em>Prometheus</em> when it comes to enemies and setting – there are even collectible xenoglyphs that will teach Seline how to read an ancient language scribbled on various walls, further fleshing out the lore. The bosses feel ripped straight from H.P. Lovecraft. One of the biomes players explore sees Seline lowered into an underwater abyss, which has a sickly designed surprise at the bottom. Other areas, such as a dusty Citadel, seem to be looking towards Roger Deakins&#8217; cinematography on <em>Blade Runner 2049</em> for visual creativity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But there is one huge issue: there is no way to save your game mid-run. Technically, the game is broken up into two halves, so there is one checkpoint, but one is still looking at hours per run. There are options to skip over defeated bosses on subsequent runs and great shortcuts, but the lack of a saving functionality takes this experience from challenge to disrespecting players&#8217; time. It also could be an insurmountable hurdle for someone that just wants to play for the story. Housemarque has acknowledged the lack of saving, so something may indeed come of this; I hope they don&#8217;t enjoy being gatekeepers and instead make the time sink slightly more accessible. It would be simple to program a save file to self-destruct upon loading one time, maintaining the high stakes of a roguelike while respecting the player&#8217;s time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The story of the game, even after watching videos diving into more delicate details, it&#8217;s ambiguous and unclear. However, there are affecting themes of resentment, obsession, neglect, passion, and family all wrapped up into a horrifying nightmare on repeat. Ramping up that terror is an astronaut figure stalking Seline that sometimes manifests into a towering mini-boss resembling a <em>Bioshock</em> Big Daddy. The narrative could be better paced, but the bullet-hell mayhem should satiate that craving in-between doses of story. Visually, it&#8217;s the first PlayStation 5 title that feels like a new generation of gaming, so that alone should put this game on the radar of anyone who owns the new system. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trepidation is fine for genre newcomers, but if you want to dip your toes into a roguelike game, <em>Returnal</em> is a good start that will scratch the edge for addictively fast-paced and tense gameplay and thoughtful storytelling. If it&#8217;s already your jam, prepare to live, die, smash controller, repeat.</span></p>\n<p><b>/Film Rating: 7 out of 10</b></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/returnal-review/\">&#8216;Returnal&#8217; is a Thrilling, Frustrating Science Fiction Video Game That&#8217;s Like Playing &#8216;Edge of Tomorrow&#8217; Inside &#8216;Prometheus&#8217;</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=R0XRzNGHRGE:GYzvUHmn21c:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=R0XRzNGHRGE:GYzvUHmn21c:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=R0XRzNGHRGE:GYzvUHmn21c:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=R0XRzNGHRGE:GYzvUHmn21c:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=R0XRzNGHRGE:GYzvUHmn21c:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=R0XRzNGHRGE:GYzvUHmn21c:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/R0XRzNGHRGE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 07 May 2021 18:00:02 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Returnal-Review-700x300.jpeg","linkMd5":"833012d3eb34a5e56a229baee21c2e3d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn17@2020_1/2021/05/09/14-16-03-801_7bdb4bf45b1b7713.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":42112,"destBytes":36120,"author":"Robert Kojder","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Returnal-Review-700x300.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn17@2020_1/2021/05/09/14-16-03-801_7bdb4bf45b1b7713.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn96@2020_2/2021/05/09/14-16-08-991_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=R0XRzNGHRGE:GYzvUHmn21c:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn92@2020_3/2021/05/09/14-16-09-380_4ec872a4403a7cc0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn24@2020_1/2021/05/09/14-16-09-490_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=R0XRzNGHRGE:GYzvUHmn21c:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn92@2020_3/2021/05/09/14-16-09-003_4f1f63a2e45333dc.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/R0XRzNGHRGE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn8@2020_1/2021/05/09/14-16-09-008_631c0ad95bf5a4d0.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1620569753474},{"createdTime":"2021-05-09 22:15:53","updatedTime":"2021-05-09 22:15:53","title":"Listen to a Track From Nicholas Britell’s ‘The Underground Railroad’ Soundtrack","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=670390","description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-underground-railroad-soundtrack.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-670413\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-underground-railroad-soundtrack-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"the underground railroad soundtrack\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-underground-railroad-soundtrack-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-underground-railroad-soundtrack-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-underground-railroad-soundtrack-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-underground-railroad-soundtrack.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>Barry Jenkins</strong> has worked with composer <strong>Nicholas Britell</strong> on <em>Moonlight</em> and <em>If Beale Street Could Talk</em>, and now they&#8217;ve reunited for <strong><em>The Underground Railroad</em></strong>. Jenkins directs the Amazon series based on the award-winning novel by Colson Whitehead, and Britell is handling the score – which, like most of his scores, is sure to be gorgeous and breathtaking. There will be multiple <em>Underground Railroad</em> soundtracks released, and the first – Volume 1 – is arriving next week. Ahead of that, the first official track from Britell&#8217;s score is now online, and you can listen to it below.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-670390\"></span></p>\n<h2><strong>The Underground Railroad Soundtrack </strong></h2>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-sUIo56q-Qw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>I am very excited to check out <em>The Underground Railroad</em>, and I&#8217;m just as excited for Nicholas Britell&#8217;s score. Britell&#8217;s <em>If Beale Street Could Talk</em> music is almost painfully beautiful; the type of swooning, gorgeous music that burns a hole in the center of your chest as you listen to it. I have no doubt the <em>Underground Railroad</em> score will follow suit, as the track above is quite lovely.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s always an interesting question for me and for Barry, &#8216;What are we trying to say with the music?&#8217; For us, the orchestra became a tool for a certain type of tone. &#8216;Bessie&#8217; is really the most full realization of that idea within the world of <em>The Underground Railroad</em>,&#8221; Britell said (via <a href=\"https://www.indiewire.com/2021/05/underground-railroad-soundtrack-bessie-listen-1234635615/\">IndieWire</a>). &#8220;That’s the sound of 50 strings together. We recorded it at AIR Studios in London. This was the largest orchestra that Barry and I as collaborators have ever done together.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Britell added:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;When I first read the book, there’s a moment where you read that there’s a skyscraper in South Carolina in the mid 1800s. That brought up the whole concept of historical anachronisms and magical realism. I started thinking to myself, &#8216;How would we musically convey a question mark over something?&#8217; Interestingly, as we got further and further in the project, it was it was actually this large, lush orchestral sound that felt almost fantastical. It created for us that feeling of a question mark. There’s a sort of strangeness, I think that the orchestra actually evoked for us in certain moments.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>The first volume of <em>The Underground Railroad</em> soundtrack is coming from Lakeshore Records on <strong>May 14</strong>, which is also the day the series arrives on Amazon Prime Video.

Told as a comedic mystery for the audience to unravel, viewers discover what pushed them to the brink, leading to their present immigration woes.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Law-and-Order-Logo.jpeg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-670108\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Law-and-Order-Logo-700x394.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"394\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Law-and-Order-Logo-700x394.jpeg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Law-and-Order-Logo-360x203.jpeg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Law-and-Order-Logo-768x432.jpeg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Law-and-Order-Logo.jpeg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Looks like it&#8217;s time for yet another <em>Law &#38; Order </em>spin-off.

fans to embark on a heist — of sorts — of their own. A global livestream event for <strong><em>Army of the Dead</em></strong> will allow fans to unlock the first 15 minutes of Zack Snyder&#8217;s zombie heist movie through an &#8220;interactive experience.&#8221; It&#8217;s not a heist featuring the undead and a <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/zack-snyders-army-of-the-dead-zombie-tiger/\">zombie tiger</a>, but it will do.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-670399\"></span></p>\n<p>Netflix announced that it will host aan interactive <em>Army of the Dead</em> event on Thursday, <strong>May 13, 2021</strong> at 10 A.M.

Fans can tune into this interactive experience to unlock the first 15 minutes of the zombie action heist flick and see special appearances from director Zack Snyder, as well as cast members Dave Bautista, Ella Purnell, Omari Hardwick, Ana De La Reguera, Matthias Schweighöfer, Nora Arnezeder, Tig Notaro and more.</p>\n<p>Once unlocked, audiences will have a 32 hour window to watch the beginning of <em>Army of The Dead</em> on the Netflix YouTube channel, which is &#8220;the same amount of time that Scott Ward (Dave Bautista) and his crew have to break into zombie-infested Las Vegas to retrieve the $200 million sitting in a vault beneath the strip before the city is nuked,&#8221; per Netflix. Netflix&#8217;s press release also says that fans will have to &#8220;dig&#8221; for the video, whatever that means.</p>\n<p>In <em>Army of the Dead</em>, &#8220;following a zombie outbreak that has left Las Vegas in ruins and walled off from the rest of the world. When Scott Ward (Dave Bautista), a displaced Vegas local, former zombie war hero who’s now flipping burgers on the outskirts of the town he now calls home, is approached by casino boss Bly Tanaka (<strong>Hiroyuki Sanada</strong>), it’s with the ultimate proposition: Break into the zombie-infested quarantine zone to retrieve $200 million sitting in a vault beneath the strip before the city is nuked by the government in 32 hours. Driven by the hope that the payoff could help pave the way to a reconciliation with his estranged daughter Kate (<strong>Ella Purnell</strong>), Ward takes on the challenge, assembling a ragtag team of experts for the heist. They include Maria Cruz (<strong>Ana de la Reguera</strong>), an ace mechanic and Ward’s old friend; Vanderohe (<strong>Omari Hardwick</strong>), a zombie killing machine; Marianne Peters (<strong>Tig Notaro</strong>), a cynical helicopter pilot; Mikey Guzman (<strong>Raúl Castillo</strong>), a go-for-broke influencer and Chambers (<strong>Samantha Win</strong>), his ride-or-die; Martin (<strong>Garret Dillahunt</strong>), the casino’s head of security; a badass warrior known as the Coyote (<strong>Nora Arnezeder</strong>) who recruits Burt Cummings (<strong>Theo Rossi</strong>), a slimy security guard; and a brilliant German safe cracker named Dieter (<strong>Matthias Schweighöfer</strong>). Scott finds an unexpected emotional hurdle when Kate joins the expedition to search for Geeta (<strong>Huma S. Qureshi</strong>), a mother who’s gone missing inside the city. With a ticking clock, a notoriously impenetrable vault, and a smarter, faster horde of Alpha zombies closing in, only one thing’s for certain in the greatest heist ever attempted: survivors take all.&#8221;</p>\n<p><em>Army of the Dead</em> opens in select theaters on Friday, <strong>May 14, 2021</strong>, followed by a Netflix debut on <strong>Friday, May 21.</strong> See a new poster for <em>Army of the Dead</em> below.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-670403\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/EN-US_AOTD_MAIN_Slots_Vertical_RGB_EN-US_Theatrical-700x1037.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"1037\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/EN-US_AOTD_MAIN_Slots_Vertical_RGB_EN-US_Theatrical-700x1037.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/EN-US_AOTD_MAIN_Slots_Vertical_RGB_EN-US_Theatrical-338x500.jpg 338w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/EN-US_AOTD_MAIN_Slots_Vertical_RGB_EN-US_Theatrical-768x1138.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/EN-US_AOTD_MAIN_Slots_Vertical_RGB_EN-US_Theatrical.jpg 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/army-of-the-dead-event-first-15-minutes/\">&#8216;Army of the Dead&#8217;

Christopher Landon, who co-wrote and directed <em>Freaky</em>, is set to produce <em>Time Cut</em>, while Michael Kennedy, who co-wrote the <em>Freaky</em> screenplay, is handling the <em>Time Cut</em> script with Sono Patel (<em>The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel</em>). Hannah Macpherson, who helmed the <em>Into the Dark</em> entry <em>Pure</em>, will direct.</p>\n<p>While we don&#8217;t have a full synopsis, <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/madison-bailey-antonia-gentry-movie-to-all-the-boys-producer-exclusive-1234947285/\">THR</a> describes the film as &#8220;<em>Back to the Future</em> meets <em>Scream</em>,&#8221; which sounds like a great idea overall. By this description we can surmise that both time travel and murder are going to be on display here, and we all love time travel and murder, don&#8217;t we, folks? Also, maybe someone  in the movie will invent rock and roll at a school dance.</p>\n<p>THR is also calling this a &#8220;YA movie,&#8221; which means it probably won&#8217;t be as gory as <em>Freaky</em>, but that&#8217;s okay. Landon has worked with a slasher movie crossed with time travel before, sort of, with the <em>Happy Death Day</em> movies. Now if only someone would go ahead and let him make <em>Happy Death Day 3</em>, gosh darn it. And while we&#8217;re at it, let&#8217;s get a <em>Freaky </em>sequel. Why not? I&#8217;d watch it, and you probably would too. Perhaps if <em>Time Cut</em> is super successful it will give Landon and Kennedy all the ammunition they need to return to that franchise (if they even want to).</p>\n<p>Netflix stars Madison Bailey (<em>Outer Banks</em>) and Antonia Gentry (<em>Ginny &#38; Georgia</em>) will star in the movie. Matt Kaplan&#8217;s ACE Entertainment, which produces the <em>To All the Boys</em> series, is also producing the movie. Production on <em>Time Cut</em> is expected to begin in Canada this June. There&#8217;s no word yet where the film will end up – either in theaters or a streaming service – so stay tuned for updates.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/time-cut/\">&#8216;Time Cut&#8217; Will Reunite &#8216;Freaky&#8217; Creative Team For Movie Described as &#8216;Back to the Future&#8217; Meets &#8216;Scream&#8217;</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=-UxK-1PnUjI:Y-GRO8fksvw:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=-UxK-1PnUjI:Y-GRO8fksvw:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=-UxK-1PnUjI:Y-GRO8fksvw:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=-UxK-1PnUjI:Y-GRO8fksvw:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=-UxK-1PnUjI:Y-GRO8fksvw:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=-UxK-1PnUjI:Y-GRO8fksvw:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/-UxK-1PnUjI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 07 May 2021 19:30:42 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/time-cut-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"389e2b70027a63e198c56157cff0a010","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn41@2020_1/2021/05/09/14-16-04-054_550877d75b21a865.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":37590,"destBytes":20060,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/time-cut-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn41@2020_1/2021/05/09/14-16-04-054_550877d75b21a865.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn96@2020_2/2021/05/09/14-16-08-991_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=-UxK-1PnUjI:Y-GRO8fksvw:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn92@2020_1/2021/05/09/14-16-08-660_1185ba02bc65ca66.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn24@2020_1/2021/05/09/14-16-09-490_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=-UxK-1PnUjI:Y-GRO8fksvw:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn30@2020_4/2021/05/09/14-16-08-672_975ccf80764fb678.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/-UxK-1PnUjI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn91@2020_2/2021/05/09/14-16-08-701_3fe253bc242d51a5.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1620569753475},{"createdTime":"2021-05-09 22:15:53","updatedTime":"2021-05-09 22:15:53","title":"Sony’s New ‘Cinderella’ Musical with Camila Cabello Has Been Sold to Amazon","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=670343","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-670350 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/cinderella-camilacabello-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"Camila Cabello Cinderella\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/cinderella-camilacabello.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/cinderella-camilacabello-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Another theatrical release bites the dust. Even though movie theaters are slowly getting back to normal and studios are starting to release major movies for audiences to see on the big screen again, not every movie waiting in the wings is lucrative enough for a studio to risk spending the money on a theatrical release right now. That&#8217;s why Sony Pictures has sold their new adaptation of the classic fairytale <strong><em>Cinderella</em></strong>, starring recording artist <strong>Camila Cabello</strong>, to Amazon instead of releasing it in theaters.<span id=\"more-670343\"></span></p>\n<p>Deadline has the news on Sony&#8217;s <em>Cinderella</em> skipping theaters and heading to a release on Amazon Prime sometime this year. The movie has been sitting around waiting for a release, and it was previously thought the movie might make it to theaters in July. But Sony Pictures has weighed their options ad figured having one of the streaming services pick it up would likely be more cost effective for them, especially after selling off other titles like Kevin Hart&#8217;s <em>Fatherhood</em> and Lin-Manuel Miranda&#8217;s animated <em>Vivo</em> to Netflix. However, I wouldn&#8217;t expect the streaming service to stick with a July window since they&#8217;re already planning on making <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-tomorrow-war-trailer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>The Tomorrow War</em> with Chris Pratt</a> their big summer movie that month.</p>\n<p>In this new take on <em>Cinderella</em>, singer Camila Cabello takes the title role while the cast is filled with some surprisingly great and even perplexing stars. <strong>Idina Menzel</strong> plays the wicked stepmother while <strong>Billy Porter</strong> takes the role of the fairy godmother. Then there are also roles for <strong>Pierce Brosnan</strong>, <strong>Minnie Driver</strong>, <strong>John Mulaney</strong>, <strong>James Corden</strong>, and hip hop artist <strong>Missy Elliot</strong>. What the hell is this movie?</p>\n<p>Well, with <em>Pitch Perfect</em> scribe and <em>Blockers</em> director <strong>Kay Cannon</strong> writing the the script and getting behind the camera, it should come as no surprise that this is actually a more contemporary version of the familiar <em>Cinderella</em> story. Apparently it features pop songs from contemporary recording artists and even some original songs by Camilla Cabello herself. Plus, Idina Menzel will be singing a bit too. Perhaps we could be looking at something like <em>A Knight&#8217;s Tale</em> crossed with <em>Ever After</em>.</p>\n<p>Cannon has proven to have a great comedic mind as she&#8217;s crafted movies with rich female characters. She may have stumbled a bit with the scripts for the <em>Pitch Perfect</em> sequels, but we&#8217;ll chalk that up to the studio forcing them to happen. Considering Cannon&#8217;s other previous efforts, which also include writing and producing for <em>30 Rock</em> and <em>New Girl</em>, this just might be worth our time.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/camila-cabello-cinderella-movie-heads-to-amazon/\">Sony&#8217;s New &#8216;Cinderella&#8217;

And in a recent Twitter Q&#38;A, McQuarrie <a href=\"https://collider.com/top-gun-maverick-christopher-mcquarrie/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">said</a> <em>Top Gun 2</em> is &#8220;the best film I&#8217;ve been a part of.

The big difference? The train sequence in De Palma&#8217;s movie was clearly enhanced by CG, and this one looks like a more modern-day Cruise stunt that was performed for real and appears to have been very dangerous.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-670088 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Halloween-Kills-set-photo-700x853.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"853\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Halloween-Kills-set-photo.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Halloween-Kills-set-photo-360x439.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><em><strong>Halloween Kills</strong></em> producer <strong>Ryan Freimann</strong> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/COCHz09lq0V/?utm_source=ig_embed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">shared</a> this image from the set of <strong>David Gordon Green</strong>&#8216;s upcoming sequel to the <em>Halloween</em> reboot.

One such title is <strong><em>Renfield</em></strong>, a movie focused on Dracula&#8217;s bug-eating minion. And according to producer <strong>Robert Kirkman</strong>, <em>Renfield</em> is going to be a bit different from the other upcoming Universal movies. For one thing, it&#8217;s being described as an &#8220;extremely violent comedy.&#8221;</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-670266\"></span></p>\n<p>After the Dark Universe crashed and burned, it looked like Universal was truly clueless about what to do with its classic monsters. Then came Leigh Whannell&#8217;s <em>The Invisible Man</em>. The film was a big hit with audiences and critics alike, and it showed that you <em>could</em> bring these characters into the modern era if you hired someone who knows what they&#8217;re doing.</p>\n<p>Since <em>The Invisible Man</em> hit theaters, Universal has announced several different monster-related projects. There&#8217;s a new <em>Dracula</em> from Karyn Kusama; there&#8217;s <em>The Invisible Woman</em> from Elizabeth Banks; Ryan Gosling is starring in a new take on <em>The Wolfman</em>, which is being directed by <em>Invisible Man</em> helmer Leigh Whannell; Paul Feig’s <em>Dark Army</em>, which is said to feature classic Universal monsters; The Monster Mash, which is a musical that we don&#8217;t know much about just yet; an untitled film produced by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller starring Channing Tatum; and more.</p>\n<p>Another one of the titles is <em>Renfield</em>, a <em>Dracula</em>-adjacent film focused on the bug-eating lunatic who has a connection with Dracula in Bram Stoker&#8217;s novel, and who was played memorably by Dwight Frye in the 1931 <em>Dracula</em> movie and Tom Waits in <em>Bram Stoker&#8217;s Dracula</em>. Renfield is a memorable, but minor, character, which means he&#8217;s going to need some fleshing out for his own movie.</p>\n<p><em>The Tomorrow War</em> filmmaker <strong>Chris McKay</strong> is in talks to direct the <em>Renfield</em> movie, with <em>Rick and Morty</em> writer<strong> Ryan Ridley</strong> tackling the script. The idea for the film came from a pitch by Robert Kirkman, who is also producing the film. During an appearance on Kevin Smith’s <a href=\"https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cDovL3Ntb2RjYXN0LmNvbS9jaGFubmVscy9mYXRtYW4tb24tYmF0bWFuL2ZlZWQ/episode/dGFnOnNvdW5kY2xvdWQsMjAxMDp0cmFja3MvMTA0MTQ1NDM5OQ?sa=X&#38;ved=0CAUQkfYCahcKEwiYzMDEirXwAhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQBA&#38;hl=en-PH\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fat Man Beyond</a> (via <a href=\"https://www.comingsoon.net/movies/news/1172502-robert-kirkman-universals-renfield-extremely-violent-comedy\">Coming Soon</a>), Kirkman shed some more light on what we can expect from the movie.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We’re doing this cool movie for Universal that&#8217;s a focus on Renfield,&#8221; Kirkman said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a story about him being Dracula&#8217;s henchman and how shitty a job that is. It’s a fun, extremely violent comedy because I’ve got a crutch, and it’s violence.&#8221;</p>\n<p>A comedy about Renfield being shitty at his job as Dracula&#8217;s henchman is a pretty damn funny idea, and my interest in this has just risen considerably. I also like knowing that Universal is willing to be flexible with these films, and not force them all into one mold – some can be horror, some can be comedies, some can be musicals. You&#8217;re dealing with supernatural monsters – the sky&#8217;s the limit here.

Six months after <strong>Cinemark</strong> <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/universal-cinemark-deal/\">struck a deal</a> with Universal Filmed Entertainment Group — which itself came a few months after Universal&#8217;s own deal with AMC Theatres — the exhibition chain has signed new pacts with five major Hollywood studios that could help shorten the theatrical window.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-670376\"></span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://variety.com/2021/film/news/cinemark-theater-deals-vod-studios-1234968717/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Variety</a> reports that Cinemark, the third most popular movie theater chain in the United States (behind AMC and Regal), has struck new agreements with five major Hollywood studios: <strong>Warner Bros. Picture Group</strong>, <strong>The Walt Disney Company</strong>, <strong>Paramount Pictures</strong>, and <strong>Sony Pictures Entertainment</strong>.</p>\n<p>The terms of the deals were not disclosed, but considering the previous pact with Universal made in November, which enabled the studio to move new releases — barring box office hits that bring in more than $50 million — to premium video-on-demand platforms just 17 days after they open in theaters, we can expect these studios to enjoy a shorter theatrical window at Cinemark theaters.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Cinemark is thrilled to have reached new agreements with our major studio partners, and we are eager to continue providing movie fans an immersive, larger-than-life cinematic environment to see major upcoming films, ranging from the biggest blockbusters to specialty fare to family-friendly content,&#8221; said Cinemark CEO Mark Zoradi. &#8220;In our ongoing efforts to maximize attendance and box office during the pandemic and beyond, our goal is to provide the widest range of content with terms that are in the best long-term interests of Cinemark, our studio partners and moviegoers. We are pleased with these recent developments and are confident we are taking positive steps toward reigniting theatrical exhibition and evolving the industry for a post-pandemic landscape.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has massively reshaped exhibition, with streaming platforms and PVOD thriving while theaters were forced to shutter. Studios pushed back many of their theatrical releases, but just as many were sent straight to streaming or home video, which led many to debate whether the long-predicted <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/will-movie-theaters-survive/\">death of theaters</a> was being accelerated. A few options have been suggested, including <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/moviegoing-post-pandemic-premium/\">premium theatrical experiences</a>, but Hollywood seems to be shifting to this shorter theatrical window.</p>\n<p>Already various studios appear to be moving toward this practice, partly in service to their new streaming platforms. Paramount has said that its films will <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/paramount-plus-movies-in-2022/\">debut on its streaming service Paramount</a>+ within 45 days of theatrical release. Warner Bros. made the controversial choice of releasing its 2021 theatrical slate <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/amc-responds-to-warner-bros-2021-plans/\">day-and-date</a> in theaters and HBO Max. These theatrical window deals between exhibition chains, which need theatrical releases to bring in audiences, and studios, which wish to save money on advertising while boosting their streaming services, seems to be the best compromise for both parties.</p>\n<p>As for Cinemark, the chain only said that &#8220;each deal has unique attributes specific to the individual studio that mutually benefits both parties.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/cinemark-theatrical-deals-hollywood-studios/\">Cinemark Signs Deals With 5 Major Hollywood Studios for Shorter Theatrical Windows</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=N41OzrtizYQ:v0vsDO8EGNg:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=N41OzrtizYQ:v0vsDO8EGNg:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=N41OzrtizYQ:v0vsDO8EGNg:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=N41OzrtizYQ:v0vsDO8EGNg:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=N41OzrtizYQ:v0vsDO8EGNg:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=N41OzrtizYQ:v0vsDO8EGNg:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/N41OzrtizYQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 07 May 2021 18:30:06 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/cinemark-theater-screen.jpg","linkMd5":"fbe4549c163a1d682786f64f956320a1","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn27@2020_5/2021/05/09/14-16-05-927_ba9eaa6f757b8d50.webp","destWidth":684,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":180951,"destBytes":26156,"author":"Hoai-Tran Bui","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/cinemark-theater-screen.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn27@2020_5/2021/05/09/14-16-05-927_ba9eaa6f757b8d50.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn96@2020_2/2021/05/09/14-16-08-991_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=N41OzrtizYQ:v0vsDO8EGNg:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn43@2020_4/2021/05/09/14-16-09-487_ed2c9941c5d505bd.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn24@2020_1/2021/05/09/14-16-09-490_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=N41OzrtizYQ:v0vsDO8EGNg:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn15@2020_1/2021/05/09/14-16-09-094_70a836deb89c5521.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/N41OzrtizYQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn15@2020_4/2021/05/09/14-16-09-456_1ee53f22a5ad92f6.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1620569753474},{"createdTime":"2021-05-09 22:15:53","updatedTime":"2021-05-09 22:15:53","title":"‘Stay Frosty’: Idris Elba to Star in Action Movie From ‘Extraction’ Director","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=670386","description":"<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-670397 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Stay-Frosty-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"Stay Frosty\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Stay-Frosty.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Stay-Frosty-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Idris Elba</strong> is continuing his push into action movie territory.</p>\n<p>The<em> Luther</em>,<em> The Wire</em>, and Marvel Cinematic Universe veteran is leading the ensemble of James Gunn&#8217;s explosive action film <em>The Suicide Squad</em> later this year, and now Elba is also set to star in a new action film called <em><strong>Stay Frosty</strong></em>, which hails from <em>Extraction</em> director <strong>Sam Hargrave</strong>.<br />\n<span id=\"more-670386\"></span></p>\n<p>Deadline reports that Warner Bros. has won a &#8220;wild spec auction&#8221; for the rights to <em>Stay Frosty</em>, shelling out more than a million dollars against low seven figures in the hopes that the project gets made.

(And speaking of the <em>Crank</em> movies, while I really like Jason Statham&#8217;s work in that franchise, I think Elba could have been a great Chelios himself had the producers gone in a different direction.) But yeah, toss a determined, righteously motivated, and pissed-off Elba in a Christmas action movie setting, and I&#8217;m absolutely interested in seeing the shit hit the fan as he tries to get home to his family.</p>\n<p><strong>Tyler Marceca</strong> wrote the script. If you don&#8217;t recognize that name, you&#8217;re not alone: he hasn&#8217;t written anything that&#8217;s been produced yet, but he did write a script for another action movie called <em>The Disciple Program</em> which was purchased by Universal way back in 2012. At the time, Mark Wahlberg was lined up to star in that project for <em>The Imitation Game</em> director Morton Tyldum, but it never materialized and we haven&#8217;t heard anything about it since. So Marceca is a blank slate to us.</p>\n<p>Hargrave is on board to direct <em>Stay Frosty</em>, which is a fun but silly title – I hope Elba utters it as a Schwarzenegger-inspired punch line just after dispatching with the villain. He worked as a stunt man, stunt coordinator, and second unit director on several major action films of the past 15 years before launching onto every studio&#8217;s radar with <em>Extraction</em>, his feature directorial debut which evidently did great viewership numbers for Netflix. An <em>Extraction</em> sequel is <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/extraction-2-sequel-or-prequel/\">reportedly in development</a>, so we&#8217;ll have to see which of these movies makes it to the starting line first.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/stay-frosty/\">&#8216;Stay Frosty&#8217;: Idris Elba to Star in Action Movie From &#8216;Extraction&#8217; Director</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=SFAuZWC-hyE:8-qqLbeFjGs:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=SFAuZWC-hyE:8-qqLbeFjGs:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=SFAuZWC-hyE:8-qqLbeFjGs:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=SFAuZWC-hyE:8-qqLbeFjGs:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=SFAuZWC-hyE:8-qqLbeFjGs:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=SFAuZWC-hyE:8-qqLbeFjGs:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/SFAuZWC-hyE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 07 May 2021 20:30:40 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Stay-Frosty-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"16bef3efd8cf78f05ecd5103a3b74e67","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn20@2020_2/2021/05/09/14-16-05-620_112248d3804afeb4.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":38620,"destBytes":26026,"author":"Ben Pearson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Stay-Frosty-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn20@2020_2/2021/05/09/14-16-05-620_112248d3804afeb4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn96@2020_2/2021/05/09/14-16-08-991_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=SFAuZWC-hyE:8-qqLbeFjGs:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn8@2020_5/2021/05/09/14-16-08-799_0e88132fc14dc2ae.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn24@2020_1/2021/05/09/14-16-09-490_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=SFAuZWC-hyE:8-qqLbeFjGs:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn28@2020_2/2021/05/09/14-16-08-746_1df264c1096a5d6f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/SFAuZWC-hyE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn64@2020_1/2021/05/09/14-16-08-937_1ce5b9d356455bb8.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1620569753475}],"record":{"createdTime":"2021-05-09 22:15:53","updatedTime":"2021-05-09 22:15:53","feedId":21,"fetchDate":"Sun, 09 May 2021 14:15:53 +0000","fetchMs":26,"handleMs":339,"totalMs":29965,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":20,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"245d88d7b2d8f26704713c23b090d029","hostName":"us-53*","requestId":"c17b557f89fa47959f54baa2c894bf42_21","contentType":"text/xml; charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":1289834,"bgimgsTotal":20,"bgimgsGithubTotal":20,"articlesImgsTotal":108,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":108,"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx14":4,"myreaderx8":4,"myreaderx15":4,"myreaderx7":4,"myreaderx16":4,"myreaderx6":3,"myreaderx10":4,"myreaderx4":4,"myreaderx32":3,"myreaderx11":4,"myreaderx33":4,"myreaderx3":3,"myreaderx2":3,"myreaderx12":3,"myreaderx13":3,"myreaderx1":4,"myreaderx30":4,"myreaderx31":4,"myreaderx18":4,"myreaderx19":4,"myreaderx":3,"myreaderx25":4,"myreaderx27":4,"myreaderx21":3,"myreaderx22":4,"myreaderx23":4,"myreaderx24":4,"myreaderx5oss":4,"myreaderx29":4},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-05-30 17:21:38","updatedTime":"2020-09-01 09:23:23","id":21,"name":"/Film","url":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/slashfilm","subscriber":null,"website":null,"icon":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/cropped-ZZ46A5EC75-32x32.jpg","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx64/cdn36@2020_2/2020/09/01/01-23-09-121_cba84478f5ca776d.jpg","description":"Movie News and Reviews This feed is for non commercial use.
