This focus on achieving while neglecting everything else can lead to a number of undesirable consequences down the line. Consequences that include loneliness, depression, or anxiety. The stress alone can result in accelerated aging, heart disease, or even death.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is even a growing phenomenon in Japan around hard‐working white‐collar workers called <a href=\"https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/02683949410075831/full/html\">karoshi</a>, meaning <em>death from overwork</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what if I told you that there was another way? What if I said that achieving more success is as simple as accepting yourself and letting go?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, let&#8217;s talk about the serious cost of overworking.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"683\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://theartofcharm.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Woman-frustrated-on-her-laptop-1-683x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Frustrated woman staring at her tablet\" class=\"wp-image-149498\" srcset=\"https://theartofcharm.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Woman-frustrated-on-her-laptop-1-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://theartofcharm.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Woman-frustrated-on-her-laptop-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://theartofcharm.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Woman-frustrated-on-her-laptop-1-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://theartofcharm.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Woman-frustrated-on-her-laptop-1-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://theartofcharm.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Woman-frustrated-on-her-laptop-1-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://theartofcharm.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Woman-frustrated-on-her-laptop-1-100x150.jpg 100w, https://theartofcharm.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Woman-frustrated-on-her-laptop-1-846x1269.jpg 846w, https://theartofcharm.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Woman-frustrated-on-her-laptop-1-944x1416.jpg 944w, https://theartofcharm.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Woman-frustrated-on-her-laptop-1-scaled.jpg 1707w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The toll overachieving takes on your own health</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Being an overachiever is tough. It takes a hardened mental fortitude to push yourself day after day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But our brains and bodies need rest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you sleep, your body is repairing itself and your brain is processing everything you learned that day. If you compromise your rest by getting less sleep or low quality sleep, you are:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Hindering your body&#8217;s ability to operate effectively when you need it most, like nailing that game changing pitch for a potential client.</li><li>Obstructing your body’s ability to repair itself after working out and burn fat, thus restricting your gains.</li><li>Preventing your brain from processing and multitasking, thus pushing those goals further out of reach.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>It is easy to neglect important aspects of our lives in an effort to accomplish more tasks on the lists we create for ourselves. But this can lead us down a self-destructive path where we cut more and more corners to get a little farther ahead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Short periods of acute stress promote growth. That can come in the form of activities like working out, tackling a difficult homework assignment, or trying to finish a complex project at work before a fast approaching deadline.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"683\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://theartofcharm.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Woman-passed-out-studying-683x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Woman asleep on a bench with a textbook open and covering her face\" class=\"wp-image-149499\" srcset=\"https://theartofcharm.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Woman-passed-out-studying-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://theartofcharm.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Woman-passed-out-studying-200x300.jpg 200w, https://theartofcharm.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Woman-passed-out-studying-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://theartofcharm.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Woman-passed-out-studying-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://theartofcharm.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Woman-passed-out-studying-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://theartofcharm.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Woman-passed-out-studying-100x150.jpg 100w, https://theartofcharm.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Woman-passed-out-studying-846x1269.jpg 846w, https://theartofcharm.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Woman-passed-out-studying-944x1416.jpg 944w, https://theartofcharm.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Woman-passed-out-studying-scaled.jpg 1707w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>But long periods of stress, or chronic stress, is detrimental to our health. According to WebMD, <a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/balance/stress-management/stress-symptoms-effects_of-stress-on-the-bodyhttps://www.webmd.com/balance/stress-management/stress-symptoms-effects_of-stress-on-the-body\">chronic stress can lead to a host of issues</a> including:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Mental health problems, such as depression, anxiety, and personality disorders</li><li>Cardiovascular disease, including heart disease, high blood pressure, abnormal heart rhythms, heart attacks, and stroke</li><li>Obesity and other eating disorders</li><li>Menstrual problems</li><li>Sexual dysfunction</li><li>Skin and hair problems</li><li>Gastrointestinal problems</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember to give yourself a break.

Sometimes those expectations are set by people around us—parents or teammates or an employer. And sometimes we set those expectations ourselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we are always holding ourselves to unrealistic expectations, we are bound to get frustrated or angry when we don&#8217;t meet them day after day, week after week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And beating yourself up for not meeting those expectations can lead to self-doubt and low self-esteem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s important to ask again, why are you constantly striving to do more?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are you trying to make yourself happy? Or the people around you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overachieving may feel rewarding in the moment. But it can be a sign that you are not accepting yourself and your accomplishments for what they are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You are enough.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You do not need to be more than what you are in order to be worthy of respect and acknowledgement and love.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://theartofcharm.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Sparkler-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"A hand holding a single burning sparkler\" class=\"wp-image-149503\" srcset=\"https://theartofcharm.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Sparkler-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://theartofcharm.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Sparkler-300x200.jpg 300w, https://theartofcharm.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Sparkler-768x512.jpg 768w, https://theartofcharm.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Sparkler-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://theartofcharm.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Sparkler-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://theartofcharm.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Sparkler-100x67.jpg 100w, https://theartofcharm.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Sparkler-846x564.jpg 846w, https://theartofcharm.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Sparkler-944x629.jpg 944w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Ways to stop being hard on yourself and accept who you are</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We are our own worst critics. Backing off and showing yourself more compassion won&#8217;t happen overnight. But you can use these tips to stop being hard on yourself and accept who you are now:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Set boundaries with others and yourself. Make sure you are not overworking, or overextending your time for people who don&#8217;t value your time as much as you do.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Take a break when you start feeling overwhelmed or overworked. Allow yourself permission to rest from things that may be turning acute stress into chronic stress. Remember, rest is not a waste of time. It is vital for your brain and body to recover between periods of mental and physical exertion.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Break down your goals into smaller and more manageable tasks. This will help you see the progress you are making in a shorter amount of time, which can motivate you to keep going and reach those milestones without running yourself into the ground.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Give yourself credit where it is due by acknowledging all of the things that have been accomplished this year so far. Those small victories are just as important for your physical and mental well-being as the big victories.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://theartofcharm.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Celebratory-Dinner-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Someone pouring a glass of champagne and setting a dinner table after the sun has set\" class=\"wp-image-149504\" srcset=\"https://theartofcharm.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Celebratory-Dinner-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://theartofcharm.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Celebratory-Dinner-300x200.jpg 300w, https://theartofcharm.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Celebratory-Dinner-768x512.jpg 768w, https://theartofcharm.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Celebratory-Dinner-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://theartofcharm.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Celebratory-Dinner-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://theartofcharm.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Celebratory-Dinner-100x67.jpg 100w, https://theartofcharm.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Celebratory-Dinner-846x564.jpg 846w, https://theartofcharm.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Celebratory-Dinner-944x629.jpg 944w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The benefits of letting go of the pressure to be perfect</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>No one is perfect and no reasonable human expects you to be perfect.

That is how you get stronger, faster, and better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem arises when you keep pushing yourself beyond your limits for extended periods of time because you think milestones and achievements equal happiness and fulfillment. It takes a toll on your health and relationships—both of which affect your ability to enjoy life in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you have kids or want kids? Because I bet they would like to have their parents around often and for as long as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You need to find that balance between giving 110% and not losing sight of who you are as an individual outside of achievement and success. Letting go of unrealistic expectations will give you some much needed breathing room. Self-care can then become priority number one again instead of just another item on the long to-do list that never gets checked off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is always more work ahead and there will always be greater goals to strive for. But that doesn&#8217;t mean you can&#8217;t be content with who you are now.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to learn more about accepting yourself for who you are and the work involved in becoming the best version of yourself so you can accomplish your dreams without burning out, we&#8217;re here for you!
