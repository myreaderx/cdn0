The theme has been abandoned by its developer, and it&#8217;s started developing formatting and other problems.</p>\n<p>Author Pro was a fairly popular theme, and I know a lot of authors who used it on their website. So when one approached me to talk about what our options were when it came to replacements, I thought it would be useful to share my advice in a blog post.</p>\n<p>So what should you do to replace the Author Pro theme?</p>\n<p>Well, that really depends on your budget, and how much free time you have. If you hired me, I would offer you three options, at ascending levels of cost:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>replace the theme with another Studiopress theme,</li>\n<li>upgrade to a better theme which is also based on Genesis, or</li>\n<li>rebuild the entire site using a completely new theme such as Divi.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each of these options has its pluses and minuses. The first option is the most limited one, but it is also the cheapest. On the other hand, you could treat this as an opportunity to rebuild and modernize your site. That will however cost you more, but I think it&#8217;s worth it.</p>\n<p>I will explain the cheapest option, and then let you know why I don&#8217;t think it is a long term solution.</p>\n<p>Our simplest and cheapest option would be to install another Studiopress theme; <a href=\"https://www.studiopress.com/themes/infinity/\">Infinity Pro</a>, for example. This is a Genesis theme, and a lot of the coding is the same as the Author Pro theme. This means that most of what work you have to do will be on the level of finding and fixing tiny details.</p>\n<p>That will work for now, but you&#8217;re going to need to get your site rebuilt in the long run &#8211; that I can guarantee.</p>\n<p>The thing is, if you have the Author Pro theme then you are probably also using the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/genesis-author-pro/\">Author Pro plugin</a> to display your books. This plugin was also built by Studiopress, and it is what powers your bookshelf. Unfortunately, Studiopress last updated the plugin two years ago, and judging by the unanswered questions in the support forum, they stopped supporting it last year.</p>\n<p>That plugin will eventually break irretrievably, so I would plan on replacing it. There are a number of competing plugins you could use (<a href=\"https://the-digital-reader.com/2017/10/25/review-roundup-seven-wordpress-plugins-author-bookshelves/\">I reviewed them a few years back</a>), but to be honest I no longer use any of theme. What I do instead is build each book page starting from a template. It&#8217;s a little more work, but it gives me a lot more flexibility in terms of design.</p>\n<p>Either way, I expect you will need to replace the Author Pro plugin eventually, and I have two options in that regard.</p>\n<p>One of your options would be to have me install a theme like <a href=\"https://bizbudding.com/mai-theme/\">Mai Theme</a>. I mention this theme because it is based on the Genesis theme, which means you can keep the Author Pro plugin for now, and then replace the plugin when it stops working.</p>\n<p>I like this theme because it is a complex theme with a lot of options. I have a client with it, so I am familiar with it. The downside is that the complexity takes more work to set up, but you can also do a lot with it in the long run.</p>\n<p>Speaking of doing more, one of your other options would be for me to rebuild the site using one of my <a href=\"https://authorwebsiteinabox.com/\">Divi</a> <a href=\"https://simpleauthorwebsites.com/\">templates</a> as a starting point. This would involve replacing and rebuilding significant parts of your existing site (Divi is not compatible with Genesis) but the upside is that it would let me build a whole new site with a whole new look.</p>\n<p>If you have a huge site with a lot of books, this could get pricy. But it will also result in a gorgeous website, and I think it&#8217;s worth it.</p>\n<p>The choice is up to you.</p>\n<p>P.S. No matter which option you chose, you should use this as an opportunity to improve your site. What I would do is make sure the author bio is up to date, and that all the pages are well-formatted.  I&#8217;d also recommend modernizing the site by removing the sidebar from the pages, and then rebuilding them (they will look so much better when you&#8217;re done). I&#8217;d also go over your site and see if you needed any pages (a media kit page, for example).</p>\n<p>If you need help, let me know.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://natehoffelder.com/blog/studiopresss-author-pro-theme-has-been-discontinued-heres-what-you-should-do-hext/\">Studiopress&#8217;s Author Pro Theme has been Discontinued &#8211; Here&#8217;s what you should do next</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://natehoffelder.com\">Nate Hoffelder, web designer</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?a=A9-69YTXZ8o:TsDcaZ8G7bE:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?a=A9-69YTXZ8o:TsDcaZ8G7bE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?a=A9-69YTXZ8o:TsDcaZ8G7bE:JUhcmGiK9AQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?d=JUhcmGiK9AQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 03 Mar 2022 23:38:00 +0000","feedId":19,"bgimg":"https://i0.wp.com/natehoffelder.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/headshot.png?fit=768%2C507&ssl=1","linkMd5":"fd9aac6808fb1a778b4a3ee6130047b3","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn9@2020_2/2022/03/14/08-14-27-176_c6ee363d0b2c76f4.webp","destWidth":768,"destHeight":507,"sourceBytes":59092,"destBytes":59092,"author":"Nate Hoffelder","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i0.wp.com/natehoffelder.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/headshot.png?fit=768%2C507&ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn9@2020_2/2022/03/14/08-14-27-176_c6ee363d0b2c76f4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn30@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-14-53-810_bfba24e96f332be8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn24@2020_1/2022/03/14/08-14-54-263_2057f12fa508c741.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?d=JUhcmGiK9AQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn36@2020_5/2022/03/14/08-14-53-810_1d48e1fa3d04ed80.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647245666874},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:14:26","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:14:26","title":"Monday Morning Coffee – 28 February 2022","link":"https://natehoffelder.com/?p=212018","description":"<img width=\"768\" height=\"432\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/natehoffelder.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/coffee.jpg?fit=768%2C432&#38;ssl=1\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;\" link_thumbnail=\"\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/natehoffelder.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/coffee.jpg?w=1920&#38;ssl=1 1920w, https://i0.wp.com/natehoffelder.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/coffee.jpg?resize=300%2C169&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/natehoffelder.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/coffee.jpg?resize=620%2C349&#38;ssl=1 620w, https://i0.wp.com/natehoffelder.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/coffee.jpg?resize=150%2C84&#38;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/natehoffelder.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/coffee.jpg?resize=768%2C432&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/natehoffelder.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/coffee.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&#38;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/natehoffelder.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/coffee.jpg?resize=610%2C343&#38;ssl=1 610w, https://i0.wp.com/natehoffelder.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/coffee.jpg?resize=1080%2C608&#38;ssl=1 1080w, https://i0.wp.com/natehoffelder.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/coffee.jpg?resize=1280%2C720&#38;ssl=1 1280w, https://i0.wp.com/natehoffelder.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/coffee.jpg?resize=980%2C551&#38;ssl=1 980w, https://i0.wp.com/natehoffelder.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/coffee.jpg?resize=480%2C270&#38;ssl=1 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><p>Here are a few stories to read this Monday morning.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span data-offset-key=\"bqu5a-0-0\">I hope I never get as famous as Edgar Allen Poe and have <a href=\"https://buff.ly/3583ImZ\">literary historians obsessing</a> over why I never had kids. </span></li>\n<li><span data-offset-key=\"bqu5a-0-0\">Does your print book infringe <a href=\"https://buff.ly/35vJUtp\">on the font copyright</a>? </span></li>\n<li><span data-offset-key=\"bqu5a-0-0\">Here&#8217;s a list of tools you can use to <a href=\"https://buff.ly/3HdX1g6\">pump up your blog posts</a>. </span></li>\n<li><span data-offset-key=\"bqu5a-0-0\">Professional feuds are nothing new, but did you know they were once <a href=\"https://buff.ly/33VEyqS\">fought in the indices of books</a>?

The current price gouging is going to end whether publishers like it or not.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://natehoffelder.com/blog/monday-morning-coffee-28-february-2022/\">Monday Morning Coffee &#8211;

This includes Amazon, which offers <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2WNVxDX\">hundreds of different subscription boxes</a>. And there is also <a href=\"http://CrateJoy.com\">CrateJoy</a>, which has a wildly diverse selection. Not all of the services ship the subscription in an actual box, but most ship every month and bill you automatically.</p>\n<p>I have been interested in the subscription boxes for some time now, but I only recently learned that there are subscription boxes specifically for writers. I haven&#8217;t seen any reviews of these boxes, and I thought it would be great fun to order them for myself and let you know if I think they are worth the money.</p>\n<p>I plan to add to this post as I hear about more subscription boxes for writers, but so far I have found only two subscription boxes for writers. One is worth buying, while the other is not.</p>\n<p><strong>Update (3 March 2022):</strong> I just got the first of three new subscription boxes I ordered back in January. So now I have 3 for you to to consider.</p>\n<p><strong>Disclosure</strong>: I bought all the boxes using my own money, and have not been given anything by any of the companies.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.scribedelivery.com/\">ScribeDelivery</a></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.scribedelivery.com/\">ScribeDelivery</a> is a themed box for stationery aficionados. It costs $29 a month and gets you a curated selection of pens, pencils, and notebooks.</p>\n<p>The one I bought in April 2020 is most definitely not worth the money. The shipment arrives in a plain white envelope, and the one I got included only a single notebook, three inexpensive pens, and five postcards.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/natehoffelder.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/scribedelivery-1.jpg?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-212024\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/natehoffelder.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/scribedelivery-1.jpg?resize=620%2C531&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"531\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.goscribbler.com/\">Scribbler</a></h2>\n<p>This subscription comes in a custom cardboard box and includes a selection of books, stationery, and fun gifts. The box I received in early May 2020 had a &#8220;drafting&#8221;-scented candle,  green apple rock candy, two novels, a couple pamphlets on writing, an invite to an online chat with an agent, and more! (There was even fuzzy orange packing material that didn&#8217;t really serve a purpose but still added to the experience.)</p>\n<p>I actually had trouble photographing it, there was so much!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/natehoffelder.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/scribbler-1.jpg?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-212023\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/natehoffelder.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/scribbler-1.jpg?resize=620%2C546&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"546\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>Just getting the box was fun, and opening it was even more fun.  This service wasn&#8217;t just designed to send you stuff but to also give you a great experience when you get it. Next time I need to get a gift for a writer friend, this is the one I will buy.</p>\n<p>The Scribbler box cost me $39 for the one box, but a subscription starts at $29 per month, and you can get a discount if you pre-pay.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.cratejoy.com/subscription-box/the-write-notebook/?product_id=3902040020\">The Write Notebook</a></h2>\n<p>I found this box <a href=\"https://www.cratejoy.com/subscription-box/the-write-notebook/?product_id=3902040020\">on Cratejoy</a>, and I have to say that I like it almost as much as the Scribbler box. At $48 per bi-monthly box, it is a little more expensive, but you also get more writer stuff.</p>\n<p>The box I got in early march 2022 did not come in a box as pretty as the Scribbler box, but it did have a lot of stuff. (I also got a couple stickers a few weeks before the box arrived.)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/natehoffelder.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/the-writer-notebook-scaled.jpg?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-212026\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/natehoffelder.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/the-writer-notebook.jpg?resize=620%2C413&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"413\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>All the items in the box shared a similar color theme, including the post it notes I forgot to include in the photo (and socks). Two of the things I licked about this box were the gift-wrapped pens, and the handmade notebook. This felt like a very personal touch which I did not get from the Scribbler box, which was nice but business like.</p>\n<p>BTW, my photo did not do this box justice; you should click through to <a href=\"https://www.cratejoy.com/subscription-box/the-write-notebook/?product_id=3902040020\">Cratejoy</a>, and see their photos. Those will give you a better idea of what you will get.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">* * *</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>I like both the Scribbler and The Write Notebook boxes. Scribbler wins on cost and value, but TWN feels more personal, and I like that.</p>\n<p>P.S. I am relatively new to subscription boxes, so I bet you know more than me. I&#8217;d love to hear what you think of the idea, and your experiences with the various services. Also, I want to order and review any and all subscription boxes for writers, so if you know of a subscription box I missed, please let me know in the comments.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://natehoffelder.com/blog/subscription-box-review-scribbler-v-scribedelivery/\">Subscription Box Review: Scribbler v ScribeDelivery v The Write Notebook</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://natehoffelder.com\">Nate Hoffelder, web designer</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?a=NxWnWt1zmj0:4I2vBmbu1xU:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?a=NxWnWt1zmj0:4I2vBmbu1xU:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?a=NxWnWt1zmj0:4I2vBmbu1xU:JUhcmGiK9AQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?d=JUhcmGiK9AQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 03 Mar 2022 19:21:34 +0000","feedId":19,"bgimg":"https://i0.wp.com/natehoffelder.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/scribbler-1.jpg?fit=768%2C676&ssl=1","linkMd5":"4cd798718747952af9e6e3275bb5893a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn7@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-14-49-483_c4928c4ce512c528.webp","destWidth":768,"destHeight":676,"sourceBytes":23156,"destBytes":23156,"author":"Nate Hoffelder","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i0.wp.com/natehoffelder.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/scribbler-1.jpg?fit=768%2C676&ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn7@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-14-49-483_c4928c4ce512c528.webp","https://i0.wp.com/natehoffelder.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/scribedelivery-1.jpg?resize=620%2C531&ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn32@2020_2/2022/03/14/08-14-54-415_f3c2bae01fea43be.webp","https://i0.wp.com/natehoffelder.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/scribbler-1.jpg?resize=620%2C546&ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn27@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-14-53-961_fa0ce24755ae2776.webp","https://i0.wp.com/natehoffelder.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/the-writer-notebook.jpg?resize=620%2C413&ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn34@2020_1/2022/03/14/08-14-54-027_42e5d0d8a604196a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn30@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-14-53-810_bfba24e96f332be8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn24@2020_1/2022/03/14/08-14-54-263_2057f12fa508c741.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?d=JUhcmGiK9AQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn36@2020_5/2022/03/14/08-14-53-810_1d48e1fa3d04ed80.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647245666874},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:14:26","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:14:26","title":"Monday Morning Coffee – 14 February 2022","link":"https://natehoffelder.com/?p=212000","description":"<img width=\"768\" height=\"432\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/natehoffelder.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/morning-coffee.jpg?fit=768%2C432&#38;ssl=1\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"display: block;

Teaching what you do forces you to better understand it, which makes you better at doing it.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://natehoffelder.com/blog/monday-morning-coffee-14-february-2022/\">Monday Morning Coffee &#8211; 14 February 2022</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://natehoffelder.com\">Nate Hoffelder, web designer</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?a=mOt_pjM4I4I:VosOvXIbOi0:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?a=mOt_pjM4I4I:VosOvXIbOi0:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?a=mOt_pjM4I4I:VosOvXIbOi0:JUhcmGiK9AQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?d=JUhcmGiK9AQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 14 Feb 2022 13:07:48 +0000","feedId":19,"bgimg":"https://i0.wp.com/natehoffelder.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/morning-coffee.jpg?fit=768%2C432&ssl=1","linkMd5":"4b65f3dfdd7ed4063eeb89f4f5aca3f6","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn12@2020_2/2022/03/14/08-14-45-256_952e3fcd5fbb4b8d.webp","destWidth":768,"destHeight":432,"sourceBytes":11214,"destBytes":11214,"author":"Nate Hoffelder","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i0.wp.com/natehoffelder.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/morning-coffee.jpg?fit=768%2C432&ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn12@2020_2/2022/03/14/08-14-45-256_952e3fcd5fbb4b8d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn30@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-14-53-810_bfba24e96f332be8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn24@2020_1/2022/03/14/08-14-54-263_2057f12fa508c741.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?d=JUhcmGiK9AQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn36@2020_5/2022/03/14/08-14-53-810_1d48e1fa3d04ed80.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647245666874},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:14:26","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:14:26","title":"Monday Morning Coffee – 21 February 2022","link":"https://natehoffelder.com/?p=212010","description":"<img width=\"768\" height=\"432\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/natehoffelder.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/morning-coffee.jpg?fit=768%2C432&#38;ssl=1\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;\" link_thumbnail=\"\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/natehoffelder.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/morning-coffee.jpg?w=1600&#38;ssl=1 1600w, https://i0.wp.com/natehoffelder.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/morning-coffee.jpg?resize=300%2C169&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/natehoffelder.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/morning-coffee.jpg?resize=620%2C349&#38;ssl=1 620w, https://i0.wp.com/natehoffelder.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/morning-coffee.jpg?resize=150%2C84&#38;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/natehoffelder.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/morning-coffee.jpg?resize=768%2C432&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/natehoffelder.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/morning-coffee.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&#38;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/natehoffelder.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/morning-coffee.jpg?resize=610%2C343&#38;ssl=1 610w, https://i0.wp.com/natehoffelder.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/morning-coffee.jpg?resize=1080%2C608&#38;ssl=1 1080w, https://i0.wp.com/natehoffelder.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/morning-coffee.jpg?resize=1280%2C720&#38;ssl=1 1280w, https://i0.wp.com/natehoffelder.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/morning-coffee.jpg?resize=980%2C551&#38;ssl=1 980w, https://i0.wp.com/natehoffelder.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/morning-coffee.jpg?resize=480%2C270&#38;ssl=1 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><p>Here are a few stories to read this Monday morning.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span data-offset-key=\"4qrif-0-0\">The judge issued a preliminary injunction in the Maryland ebook licensing case <a href=\"https://buff.ly/3s0tFNF\">in favor of publishers</a>.
