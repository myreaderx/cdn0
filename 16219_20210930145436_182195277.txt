All of her paintings <em>{acrylic on canvas}</em> are self-portraits, and in some cases, “plural self-portraits”. This originated from being bullied when she was younger … she <em>“had felt a fear what others thought about [her], and as a result, was confused about how to relate to others.”</em> Over the past several years, she has continued to explore this idea of acceptance &#8211; or lack there of &#8211; and the paintings above are the latest result. Here’s an excerpt from a recent video interview with Naomi:</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>“I want to create the effects of camouflage. This person is melting into the background, which is how I think about fashion, especially in Japan. I was told that I shouldn&#8217;t be so outstanding.</em></p>\n<p><em>So, if I just paint only this one person, she would stand out because she&#8217;s wearing such a bright dress. But, if I paint other very bright patterns, she will to melt into the background. It’s the social conflict between standing out / melting in.”</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>So true for so many of us, yes? <strong><a href=\"https://allarts.org/programs/flowstate-north-brooklyn-artists/naomi-okubo-awifol/\">Watch the full video</a></strong>, created by <a href=\"https://allarts.org/\">ALL*ARTS</a>, and follow Naomi on Instagram at <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/naomi_okubo/\">@naomi_okubo</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 30 Sep 2021 08:00:58 +0000","feedId":16219,"bgimg":"https://www.thejealouscurator.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/naomiokubo.jpg","linkMd5":"444e168e73f9abcc19fdb7a70e16498b","destWidth":584,"destHeight":3372,"sourceBytes":3001433,"destBytes":704270,"author":"the jealous curator","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.thejealouscurator.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/naomiokubo.jpg":null},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1633013667763}],"record":{"createdTime":"2021-09-30 22:54:27","updatedTime":"2021-09-30 22:54:27","feedId":16219,"fetchDate":"Thu, 30 Sep 2021 14:54:27 +0000","fetchMs":7371,"handleMs":14365,"totalMs":30875,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":10,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"af6ca12eefe249e94a3f077d15d7c168","hostName":"europe-57*","requestId":"c7fa01d033c34349a350d89e53577bde_16219","contentType":"application/rss+xml;
