Under Biden's <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/what-joe-bidens-tax-plan-could-mean-for-big-businesses-2020-11\">tax plan</a>, US companies would have to pay more in federal taxes.</p><p>But even if the Democrats eke out a small majority in the Senate, there will be moderates among them who won't vote for large tax increases. This would prove to be a relief for markets, Diton pointed out.</p><p>The October stock market pullback right before the election was a result of market concern over Biden's tax agenda, he said. There was actually widespread relief that the Democrats lost seats, and that there is now closer balance in the house with a slightly Republican Senate.&#160;</p><p>After Democrats fell short in several Senate races on November 3, both of Georgia's US Senate seats are <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/georgia-senate-runoff-elections-jon-ossoff-david-perdue-warnock-loeffler-2020-11\">headed for runoff elections in January</a>.&#160;</p><p><em><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-picks-to-buy-cheap-companies-value-economic-rebound-goldman-2020-11\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">GOLDMAN SACHS: Buy these 20 deeply underpriced stocks now before the recovery helps them rebound and crush Wall Street's low expectations in 2021</a></em></p><p>It is highly unlikely that Democrats would make up a Senate majority because Georgia hasn't given its vote to the party since 2000, Diton said.&#160;</p><p>If Republicans hold on to a Senate majority, that would prevent Democrats from passing much of the sweeping legislation they pledged to pursue under Biden.

Since then President Donald Trump and his campaign — despite never admitting it — have been handed defeat after defeat.</p><p>On Friday, a judge threw out the Trump campaign's third attempt to delay the certification of the election results in Michigan — where the president lost by more than 140,000 votes. Around the same time the campaign pulled out of a lawsuit in Arizona, which has also been called for Biden. In Pennsylvania, a law firm representing the president's campaign <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/nov/13/trump-law-firm-withdraws-pennsylvania-election-case\">withdrew</a> from a lawsuit challenging his loss in that state, where Biden beat Trump by over 50,000 votes.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/11/08/932744212/trump-goes-through-with-lawsuits-insists-he-won-election\">transcripts</a> of the Trump campaign's appearances in various state courts — which are very clearly annoying judges in courts across the country — would be funny if they weren't such a waste of time and if Trump's attack on democracy weren't so hazardous. He has no path to reclaim the presidency.</p><p>And yet, high-ranking Republicans in Congress and the administration are going along with Trump's delusional attempts to stay in power. And the only reason the Republican establishment won't break with the president's fantasy is because they are addicted to Trumpism and the way it turns out voters. Winning is a high.</p><p>This addiction puts the entire country in a precarious situation. As long as the GOP relies on Trumpism to win elections it will be anti-democratic leech on our system, draining it of trust and poisoning our political discourse.</p><p>Consider the damage he is doing now. Despite the fact that election officials from both parties across the country keep saying this election was fair, Trump keeps casting doubt on the electoral process and his followers believe him.</p><p>According to a Reuters/Ipsos poll <a href=\"https://news.yahoo.com/nearly-80-americans-biden-won-223934570.html\">20% of Americans</a> believe the election was stolen. A Morning Consult poll found that 70% of Republicans believe the <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/11/09/republicans-free-fair-elections-435488?nname=politico-nightly&nid=00000170-c000-da87-af78-e185fa700000&nrid=0000014e-f10a-dd93-ad7f-f90f318e0001&nlid=2670445nlid=2670445\">election was unfair</a>. Those are all people who will be more willing to follow another demagogue politician like Trump — a man who claimed he alone \"could fix it,\" the \"it\" being our broken democracy.&#160;</p><h2>'Like a wolf by the ears'</h2><p>Of course, we knew Trump and his family would be willing to <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-trumpworld-sore-losers-election-biden-expected-dont-panic-2020-11\">burn it all down</a> before conceding that he lost. What's pathetic is that his party is willing to join the Trumps in perpetuating these lies, even though Republican leaders know better. They know that our political system is built on trust in it and in each other.&#160;</p><p>\"What is the downside for humoring him for this little bit of time? No one seriously thinks the results will change,\" one senior GOP official told the <a href=\"https://t.co/3Ow1xUurgb?amp=1\">Washington Post</a>. This is a disastrously short-sighted comment from a member of a disastrously short-sighted party.</p><p>Yes, fomenting grievance about a \"stolen\" election may turn out voters in the two Senate special elections in Georgia set for January. But it will also make it difficult — if not impossible — for Congress to pass a coronavirus aid bill before Biden takes office. It will anger Democrats and make it harder for them to talk to their families over the holidays and in the weeks, months, years after this election. It will further cement the GOP as a nakedly anti-democratic party before the country and the entire world.</p><p>And do not get it twisted: Trump has no loyalties and nothing is ever his fault, so he will eventually find a way to blame his loss on the GOP apparatus. There's no amount of boot licking the likes of Sens. Ted Cruz and Lindsey Graham can do in the next 60-odd days to avoid his derision once he's forced to accept that loss. They should know that. He will hold this grudge, and he will exercise it whenever he has a chance — and for as long as he legitimacy in the eyes of his supporters he will have many chances.&#160;</p><p>Trump already started undermining his so-called allies. Over at the New York Times Maggie Haberman <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/12/us/politics/trump-future.html\">reports</a> that he is already talking about running in 2024. It's a way to keep money flowing into his very-indebted pockets, and it's a way to ensure the crowded field of would-be Republican candidates is brought to heel. It's mean, it's selfish, and it's what Trump will keep doing to his own party for as long as they give him the power to do so.</p><p>That would mean, however, the GOP would have to stop using his following to turn up votes. For a party that has for years been focused on power for power's sake that is perhaps too hard to surrender. Trump has the leadership of this weak, venal Republican Party like a <a href=\"https://www.monticello.org/site/research-and-collections/famous-jefferson-quotes\">wolf by the ears,</a> holding on could destroy you, but letting go is dangerous too.</p><p>Now that he has been voted out of the White House it is the GOP that will decide if Trump will continue dividing the country into white and non-white, Republican and Democrat, urban versus rural. In the meantime 80 million Americans will wait for the Republican Party to admit it has a problem. That's the first step to recovery.&#160;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/gop-quit-trump-addiction-suck-life-out-destroy-american-democracy-2020-11'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=MEUnjfpNCRQ:RC0N_fU3pNs:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=MEUnjfpNCRQ:RC0N_fU3pNs:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=MEUnjfpNCRQ:RC0N_fU3pNs:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=MEUnjfpNCRQ:RC0N_fU3pNs:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=MEUnjfpNCRQ:RC0N_fU3pNs:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=MEUnjfpNCRQ:RC0N_fU3pNs:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=MEUnjfpNCRQ:RC0N_fU3pNs:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=MEUnjfpNCRQ:RC0N_fU3pNs:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/MEUnjfpNCRQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 15 Nov 2020 13:28:00 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5faf1bce402d49001924ef9b?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"19445aba8ad499c2037b466e14d83b67","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn99@2020_4/2020/11/15/21-54-33-584_1504663734730dd1.webp","destWidth":910,"destHeight":683,"sourceBytes":27710,"destBytes":27710,"author":"llopez@businessinsider.com (Linette Lopez)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5faf1bb01c741f0019ac9d42?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn96@2020_4/2020/11/15/21-54-26-502_117641ac97736155.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn12@2020_6/2020/11/15/21-54-31-271_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=MEUnjfpNCRQ:RC0N_fU3pNs:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn76@2020_3/2020/11/15/21-54-29-536_86aff2a539755ca8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=MEUnjfpNCRQ:RC0N_fU3pNs:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn63@2020_2/2020/11/15/21-54-31-111_9c9a2189096144d3.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn35@2020_1/2020/11/15/21-54-27-665_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=MEUnjfpNCRQ:RC0N_fU3pNs:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn92@2020_5/2020/11/15/21-54-28-908_5c5433e6758494f5.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/MEUnjfpNCRQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn76@2020_3/2020/11/15/21-54-30-305_d52c867b7508d5fd.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605477242121},{"createdTime":"2020-11-16 05:54:02","updatedTime":"2020-11-16 05:54:02","title":"SpaceX is about to rocket its first 'operational' astronaut mission into orbit for NASA.

Notably absent? Native youth.&#160;</p><p>Yet this little omission merely rubbed salt into a wound created on election night by CNN, when the cable news network <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/tv/story/2020-11-05/it-looks-like-cnn-called-native-americans-something-else-theyre-not-happy\">featured</a> an on-air graphic that labeled voters who were not white, Latino, Black, or Asian, \"something else.\"&#160;</p><p>Natives are incredibly resilient and are notorious for using humor to cope with trauma and defuse tension, so Native social media accounts flooded platforms with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KaitlynKayquop1/status/1324153474859216898?s=20\">memes</a> making fun of the blunder, but make no mistake, we were insulted.&#160;</p><p>The Native American Journalists Association (NAJA) <a href=\"https://najanewsroom.com/2020/11/05/naja-demands-cnn-apologize-for-using-something-else-to-describe-native-voters/\">demanded</a> an apology from CNN, saying, \"Being Native American is a political classification — not merely a racial background.

To refer to Indigenous voters as 'something else' fails to recognize the sovereignty and political classification of Native voters.\"&#160;</p><p>They also offered to meet with senior CNN editorial staff to assist them in improving their reporting (or lack thereof) on Indian country.&#160;</p><h2><strong>Native voters in key states played a pivotal role in the election.&#160;</strong></h2><p>Disregarding the original people of this continent is never okay, but erasing us during election coverage cut deep. You see, Native communities work their collective asses off to turn out the vote, and this year, Native voters in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Arizona especially, played a <a href=\"https://www.ncai.org/news/articles/2020/11/07/ncai-congratulates-president-elect-biden-and-vice-president-elect-harris-on-their-historic-victory\">pivotal role</a>.</p><p>Natives <a href=\"https://www.hcn.org/articles/indigenous-affairs-how-indigenous-voters-swung-the-2020-election\">make up</a> about 6% of the population of Arizona, or 424,955 people as of 2018, and the Navajo Nation has around 67,000 eligible voters. This election, the Navajo had a 97% voter turnout. President-elect Joe Biden won the three counties that overlap the Navajo Nation with <a href=\"https://navajotimes.com/rezpolitics/election-2020/arizona-flips-navajos-contribute-to-historic-shift/\">73,954 votes</a>. President Donald Trump received a mere 2,010 votes.&#160;</p><p>Most precincts located on the Tohono O'odham Nation were above <a href=\"https://www.hcn.org/articles/indigenous-affairs-how-indigenous-voters-swung-the-2020-election\">90%</a> for Biden, and the territories of the Hualapai, Havasupai, White Mountain Apache, Gila River, San Carlos Apache, Pascua Yaqui, Cocopah and Colorado River Tribes were <a href=\"https://www.hcn.org/articles/indigenous-affairs-how-indigenous-voters-swung-the-2020-election\">70-90%</a> for Biden. Biden currently leads in Arizona by <a href=\"https://www.wusa9.com/elections-2020-map\">11,935 votes</a> with 98% of the votes tallied — a margin slimmer than the Native voter turnout.&#160;</p><p>Tribes in Arizona also helped <a href=\"https://navajotimes.com/rezpolitics/election-2020/arizona-flips-navajos-contribute-to-historic-shift/\">flip</a> an Arizona Senate seat from red to blue as former astronaut Mark Kelly unseated Republican incumbent Martha McSally.</p><p>About 90,189 Natives call Wisconsin home. Biden won the state by less than 21,000 votes. In Menominee County, where you'll find the Menominee Tribe's reservation, <a href=\"https://www.hcn.org/articles/indigenous-affairs-how-indigenous-voters-swung-the-2020-election\">82% of voters</a> supported Biden.&#160;</p><p>Besides having to overcome <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/oct/16/native-americans-voting-rights-mail-in-ballots-us-elections\">voter suppression</a>, it's important to remember that Tribes are being <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/04/24/coronavirus-indian-country-hit-hard-tribes-battle-red-tape/5130415002/\">hit hard</a> by the pandemic and have received little assistance. Tribes even had to <a href=\"https://www.azfamily.com/news/continuing_coverage/coronavirus_coverage/court-rules-in-favor-of-navajo-nation-lawsuit-for-coronavirus-relief-fund/article_7be46fe6-8901-11ea-8466-93bb8a0c911b.html\">sue</a> to receive $8 billion in COVID-19 relief funding owed to them by the federal government. In May 2020, the Navajo Nation had coronavirus infection rates that <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/18/us/navajo-nation-infection-rate-trnd/index.html\">eclipsed</a> those of New York. They've lost <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ABecenti/status/1325631540852903936?s=20\">nearly 600</a> Tribal members to the virus. The Tohono O'odham Nation of Arizona has also been engaged in a lengthy <a href=\"http://www.tonation-nsn.gov/nowall/\">battle</a> with the Trump administration over construction of his shoddy border wall through their ancestral lands and sacred sites without their consent.</p><h2><strong>We aren't sitting on the sidelines, either.&#160;</strong></h2><p>In 2020, a record <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/six-native-americans-elected-to-congress-record-breaking/\">six</a> Native candidates will be a part of the United States Congress. Dozens of Native candidates were elected to state and local office across the country, as well.&#160;</p><p>It's no wonder Jonathan Nez, President of the Navajo Nation, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/NezLizer2018/videos/386485839443783/\">appeared on CNN</a> and gave them a piece of his mind, saying that categorizing Natives as \"something else\" is offensive. (It is.)&#160;</p><p>The good news is that the new presidential administration, the one we helped put in office, acknowledges us, and wants to work with Tribal communities. On <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojzHiBxHOCE\">Saturday</a>, Vice President-elect Kamala Harris expressly mentioned Native women among those that have fought for equality and liberty, and President-elect Joe Biden listed Native Americans as being a part of his broad coalition. Biden has also <a href=\"https://buffalochronicle.com/2020/11/07/biden-promises-to-appoint-at-least-one-native-american-to-the-cabinet/\">vowed</a> to put at least one Native American in his Cabinet.&#160;</p><h2><strong>We deserve America's respect</strong></h2><p>As a willful, curious, free-spirited child, I heard the phrase, \"You're Something Else!\" more than a few times. While using that expression in terms of data collection is indicative of sloppy journalism and disrespectful to those put in such a category, perhaps describing Natives generally as \"something else\" isn't far off from the truth — because we create miracles.&#160;</p><p>Native Americans owe the United States nothing. We were subjected to centuries of genocide and lost over 90% of our population. Our lands were stolen, and our treaties were broken. We are still discriminated against and many Reservations face extreme imposed poverty. Yet we serve in the military <a href=\"https://www.militarytimes.com/off-duty/military-culture/2019/11/15/a-warrior-tradition-why-native-americans-continue-fighting-for-the-same-government-that-tried-to-wipe-them-out/#:~:text=To%20this%20day%2C%20American%20Indians,percent%20of%20all%20other%20ethnicities.\">in greater numbers than any other ethnic group</a>, protect the land and water with our lives, and yes, we came to your rescue again, like the Navajo codetalkers during World War II, and helped you escape an authoritarian theocracy and quite likely, a fascist dictatorship.&#160;</p><p>Respect us.</p><p><em>Ruth Hopkins is a Dakota/Lakota Sioux Writer &#38; Indigenous Defender.

Black, Asian, and Minority Ethnic (BAME) health workers in the United Kingdom's National Health Service have become ill and died in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/nhs-bosses-say-bame-staff-should-be-risk-assessed-to-cut-covid-19\">disproportionate numbers</a>. Haitians, many of them asylum seekers, have <a href=\"https://globalnews.ca/news/6942429/montreal-vulnerable-neighbourhoods-coronavirus/\">endured illness and death</a> since the virus gripped Quebec's long-term care settings.&#160;</p><p>The US and many other high-income countries <a href=\"https://muse.jhu.edu/book/13864\">have long relied</a> on foreign-born and educated nurses, nurse aides, doctors, and others working in long-term care, hospitals, clinics, and more. As COVID-19 has unfurled, migrant care workers across the world have served on the front line of crisis response and suffered for it.&#160;</p><p>Migrant care workers' heightened risk of exposure for themselves, their families, and their communities is not coincidental. It is a reflection of <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/nation/2020/10/12/coronavirus-deaths-reveal-systemic-racism-united-states/5770952002/\">structural health vulnerabilities</a> that are born from stereotypes, workplace conditions, systemic poverty, immigration processes, housing costs, and other historic systems of oppression.&#160;</p><p>These workers are often <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/05/us-nursing-homes-coronavirus-outbreak\">reluctant to raise concerns</a> about inadequate supplies of necessary resources for fear of sanctions that range from discrimination to deportation. Those working in long-term care often live on the edge of poverty and ill health, with low wages, few benefits, and some of the highest occupational risk there is. Psychological stress suffered by health workers of all kinds, especially migrants, in this context is unprecedented.&#160;</p><h2>Why we need solidarity</h2><p>Why should our concern for this heightened loss of life and opportunity among these healthcare workers go beyond regret or pity?&#160;</p><p>A key reason draws from the ethical notion of solidarity. Solidarity involves assisting and supporting others because we recognize something shared between us like our common humanity, or our need for care when we are sick and as we age. At its core, solidarity is the belief that people are fundamentally embedded in social relationships and cannot truly exist as individuals without relying on others, especially given our need for care in the face of illness and other hardships. If anything, the COVID-19 pandemic reminds us of our shared frailty as humans and our need for care.&#160;</p><p>Solidarity with migrants — and all health workers — requires providing adequate personal protective equipment (PPE), better staffing ratios, decision-making power over patient care and matters of management, the right to raise concerns without fear of reprisal, and living wages and fair benefits that afford ample social and economic protection, such as sick leave and health insurance, and moreover, are more befitting skilled work involving vulnerable people.</p><p>Furthermore, it requires reforming immigration and asylum processes that can pose <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/13/us/coronavirus-foreign-doctors-nurses-visas.html\">barriers</a>, like long waits to obtain visas. Many thousands of refugees and other immigrants with health degrees already living in \"destination\" countries like the US work in jobs below their level of education, or want to work but are unemployed due to complexities of licensing requirements. Better coordination at the federal level, between the Department of State, Health and Human Services, and Citizenship and Immigration Services — in addition to better global governance over so-called human health resources, could also show solidarity.&#160;&#160;</p><p>There are also self-interested reasons for showing concern for workers' conditions and their health. When facing a contagious disease, heightened risk for anyone translates into heightened risk for everyone. If a nurse has access to an N95 mask, it doesn't just protect them — it also inhibits the spread of infectious particles to patients (who may not even be in for COVID-19) and their families, filtering <a href=\"https://www.hackensackmeridianhealth.org/HealthU/2020/08/26/which-masks-are-most-effective-and-why/\">95% of airborne particles</a>. When we don't protect our healthcare workers, entire communities are at greater risk of infectious transmission. The tragic loss of elders in nursing facilities across <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/17/world/canada/canada-coronavirus.html\">Quebec</a> and the loss of life in the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/filipinos-make-up-disproportionate-covid-19-nurse-deaths-2020-9\">Filipino community</a> make clear <em>precisely</em> this threat to public health.</p><p>While there is an ethical imperative to show solidarity through specific actions promoting collective safety, self-interest should provide more motivation. The lives of Filipino nurses, Haitian nurse aides, and Nigerian doctors and their families are interwoven with the lives and health of elderly Quebecois and Americans, and in turn, their communities. To protect migrant care workers as well as ourselves we must provide them with sufficient PPE, living wages, better representation so that they can voice concerns, and more. This is not just a need in the time of COVID; it is a long-term effort to re-imagine how we care for people. Our health is, and has long been, interdependent. We are bound to one another.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/migrant-foreign-born-healthcare-workers-america-covid-19-coronavirus-pandemic-2020-11'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=OGxhYY6wNRk:tFZEBfKwSoQ:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=OGxhYY6wNRk:tFZEBfKwSoQ:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=OGxhYY6wNRk:tFZEBfKwSoQ:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=OGxhYY6wNRk:tFZEBfKwSoQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=OGxhYY6wNRk:tFZEBfKwSoQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=OGxhYY6wNRk:tFZEBfKwSoQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=OGxhYY6wNRk:tFZEBfKwSoQ:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=OGxhYY6wNRk:tFZEBfKwSoQ:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/OGxhYY6wNRk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 15 Nov 2020 15:28:00 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5faac4961df1d50018219dfb?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"a43fca6c0ee404ca52867eb1f0f05044","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn8@2020_1/2020/11/15/21-54-02-514_188a557bda8c7b0c.webp","destWidth":1949,"destHeight":1462,"sourceBytes":195112,"destBytes":195112,"author":"insider@insider.com (Lisa Eckenwiler)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5faac4961df1d50018219dfb?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn8@2020_1/2020/11/15/21-54-02-514_188a557bda8c7b0c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn12@2020_6/2020/11/15/21-54-31-271_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=OGxhYY6wNRk:tFZEBfKwSoQ:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn47@2020_3/2020/11/15/21-54-30-823_b5b6882dea6348c8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=OGxhYY6wNRk:tFZEBfKwSoQ:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn84@2020_5/2020/11/15/21-54-31-875_d1c327c2f2317289.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn35@2020_1/2020/11/15/21-54-27-665_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=OGxhYY6wNRk:tFZEBfKwSoQ:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn52@2020_6/2020/11/15/21-54-27-871_b343e4b3a3084591.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/OGxhYY6wNRk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn39@2020_6/2020/11/15/21-54-24-419_5a3c1661abe0863d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605477242105},{"createdTime":"2020-11-16 05:54:02","updatedTime":"2020-11-16 05:54:02","title":"Salesforce hired a chief equality officer 4 years ago.

The election <strong>will</strong> be certified by the states on December 14, 2020. In less than 10 weeks Joe Biden <strong>will</strong> become President of the United States to the sound of huzzahs from a majority of its people, the pealing of church bells, and the beating of pots and pans at noon on January 20, 2021. And Donald Trump, like every bully, <strong>will</strong> run from the White House well before the US Marshals or Secret Service is forced to physically remove him.</p><p>Yes, the finale of the single season (term) of 'The Apprentice POTUS' will attract the \"high ratings\" that Trump has always craved. He will also put on one doozy of a show (or \"no-show\" when Inauguration Day comes around). But don't be distracted, you have a far greater concern. One that will emerge, not end, on January 20.</p><p>I believe that the current, norm-busting, president will almost certainly prove to be a convention-shattering post-president. It would be ludicrous to expect anything else from Trump. And that poses problems not only for the incoming Biden administration, but for the US electorate, the media and – yes – our economy.</p><p>This is because Trump, and not just a few Republicans who remain in office, will not truly concede the legitimacy of the 2020 presidential election – for a long time in many cases, likely never in the case of Trump.</p><p>And Trump – in his gilded cage at Mar-a-Lago, or wherever else he may deposit himself – will likely go on to lead a rump government (a T-Rump government, as it were) over his tens of millions of adulating supporters, which will proceed to heap a continuing stream of bloviating criticism, conspiracy and counterfactuals (aka. lies) on the American people, the media and the world.</p><h2><strong>A belligerent and boisterous post-presidency</strong></h2><p>Trump's will be a first-of-its-kind post-presidency in the modern era, with \"the Donald\" norm-busting his way out of the tradition of reticence that has been observed by American leaders who have departed the White House by force of the electorate or by expiration of term limits.&#160;</p><p>From the moment Joseph R. Biden Jr. says \"...so help me God\" at noon on January 20, you can pretty much count on Trump commencing his signature block-caps, exclamation point-laden four year Twitter thread on the Biden administration, laden with \"alternative facts.\"</p><p>Now, if the nation and the world were to accept this as Trump merely engaging in the trademark form of creative hyperbole that has always characterized his commercial activities, that would be one thing. Trump will plainly seek to profit from his post-presidency in ways never seen before in American history. He will surely need money – facing, as he is, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/16/us/trump-taxes.html\">the maturity of over $400 million in debt</a> secured by assets of questionable value, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/21459231/trump-tax-returns-evasion-fraud\">enormous potential claims by the IRS</a> (together with related civil and criminal legal exposure), <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/13/nyregion/trump-taxes.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=HomepageHomepage\">civil and criminal actions by both the State and City of New York</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/13/opinion/trump-prosecution-lawsuits.html?action=click&module=Opinion&pgtype=HomepageHomepage\">a litany of lawsuits from women he has (allegedly) attacked and people he has (allegedly) defrauded</a>.&#160;</p><p>Some of the legal challenges may be stymied by the self-pardon (or a \"<a href=\"https://twitter.com/DanielAlpert/status/1322164211154329605?s=20\">resign and have Mike Pence\" pardon</a>) that will shock many but is nearly baked into reality at this point as the logical act of a desperate and amoral man. Yet even if the Supreme Court tolerates such brazen self-dealing as a constitutional matter (by no means certain even with the present Trump-tailored court), he clearly won't be able to shake off enough of the above challenges to leave him home free.</p><p>Having known Trump (believe me, not well – I worked for his organization to try to salvage his casino empire 20 years ago, with tragicomical results as he had no clue what he was facing then either) and understanding his milieu, he has only two things going for him right now.</p><p>&#160;First is his 70 million or so supporters in the United States (nothing to trifle with). And second is the tarnished value of his \"TRUMP\" real estate brand, which may still have some value offshore (think Saudi Arabia or the Philippines).&#160;</p><p>The first is an ocean upon which he can float a media empire – not only news and entertainment content, but <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Lindell\">\"My Pillow-guy\"</a> type product endorsements, books and speaking tours/rallies – and maintain whatever political influence he will be left with. The second is the source of easy money (that is, after <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/money-donald-trump-election-defense-flow-d533491164bd4cae7ac47392ca740c7d\">he has tapped his deluded supporters dry</a>) from brand licensing that may help him keep his deteriorating empire from completely crumbling.</p><p>It is the first – Trump remaining in all our faces, and eligible to run again for president – that poses real risk to American democratic institutions, to the economy and to markets. A Trump TV and tent show operation that continues to clench the Republican Party in his, and his family's, grasp will not only do its best to undermine the Biden administration, but will send consumers, businesses, financial markets and foreign nations riding on a alternative-fact-powered consensus roller coaster with regard to current conditions and the future of the nation and its policies.</p><p>Trump has always placed image before reality – in business as well as politics. He is fueled by attention. He will get plenty of it from his self-created media outlet (or Fox News <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/12/media/fox-news-trump-future/index.html\">if he and his supporters can find a way to forgive</a> the Murdoch empire) and social media.&#160;</p><p>It is up to the rest of America, and the Trump-titled \"Lamestream\" media to work overtime to ignore him, deprive him of his \"T-Rump\" government, and, instead, focus all attention on doing what we need to do to <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/election-trump-era-ending-america-economic-social-issues-exist-2020-11\">makes the lives of the Americans who support Trump \"Great Again\"</a> during the coming four years. That is the only way to move past the era of Trumpism.&#160;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-belligerent-post-presidency-headache-biden-us-economy-2020-11'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=i9GskezLKew:losOXklo9jw:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=i9GskezLKew:losOXklo9jw:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=i9GskezLKew:losOXklo9jw:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=i9GskezLKew:losOXklo9jw:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=i9GskezLKew:losOXklo9jw:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=i9GskezLKew:losOXklo9jw:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=i9GskezLKew:losOXklo9jw:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=i9GskezLKew:losOXklo9jw:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/i9GskezLKew\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 15 Nov 2020 13:02:00 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5fb000c8402d49001924efe2?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"7dc224d3fba73924277ee9af7cf14970","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn88@2020_5/2020/11/15/21-54-33-526_f31480e7f42d49c9.webp","destWidth":1776,"destHeight":1332,"sourceBytes":78100,"destBytes":78100,"author":"insider@insider.com (Daniel Alpert)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5fb000d1402d49001924efe3?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn84@2020_2/2020/11/15/21-54-29-639_80975f6ac3cc70be.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn12@2020_6/2020/11/15/21-54-31-271_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=i9GskezLKew:losOXklo9jw:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn87@2020_5/2020/11/15/21-54-28-147_b691b6b2b4b7f7af.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=i9GskezLKew:losOXklo9jw:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn43@2020_6/2020/11/15/21-54-28-579_78a64d4c74e0402c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn35@2020_1/2020/11/15/21-54-27-665_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=i9GskezLKew:losOXklo9jw:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn83@2020_6/2020/11/15/21-54-26-678_8c360764ee39a3fa.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/i9GskezLKew":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn95@2020_2/2020/11/15/21-54-25-523_da68ddd017a9a4bc.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605477242127},{"createdTime":"2020-11-16 05:54:02","updatedTime":"2020-11-16 05:54:02","title":"Obama said his first instinct was to 'walk down and smack' GOP Rep.

But NASA chief Jim Bridenstine <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JimBridenstine/status/1328046674699300869\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">tweeted</a> on Sunday afternoon those conditions \"are within margins\" and that SpaceX is \"still a go for launch.\"</p>\n<p>Here's why a crewed SpaceX launch can't wait a single second longer after it's supposed to lift off.</p>\n<h2>The twin problems of ultracold fuel and a laboratory moving at 17,500 mph</h2>\n<figure> \n <img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5ecee46a5af6cc3c4d39d815?format=jpeg\" alt=\"spacex demo 2 launch falcon 9 fuel crew dragon\" height=\"1768\" width=\"2357\" charset=\"\"> \n  <figcaption>\n   The SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket purges fuel after topping off before scheduled launch of NASA's SpaceX Demo-2 mission to the International Space Station from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida, May 27, 2020. \n   <p class=\"copyright\"><a href=\"https://www.reutersconnect.com/all?id=tag%3Areuters.com%2C2020%3Anewsml_HP1EG5R1KN613&amp;share=true\" target=\"_blank\">Joe Skipper/Reuters</a></p> \n  </figcaption> </img>\n</figure>\n<p>Once SpaceX starts fueling a Falcon 9 rocket, it begins a process in which imprecise timing could mean life or death.</p>\n<p>\"Once you get into propellant loading at T-minus-35 minutes, you have to go as soon as you get to zero,\" Insprucker said in May ahead of Demo-2's first scrubbed flight attempt. \"We don't have the ability to stop the countdown, wait 5 minutes.\"</p>\n<p>That's because liquid oxygen is pumped into the Falcon 9 at a very low temperature: 340 degrees Fahrenheit below zero. That keeps it liquid and densifies the fuel, a type of kerosene called RP-1, which allows SpaceX to cram more of it into the rocket and squeeze more performance out if the machine.</p>\n<p>In fact, it's part of what gives the Falcon 9 its unprecedented thrust — the force behind its launch that allows it to push more than 50,000 pounds of cargo into orbit. The extra reserves also provide more wiggle room to reach orbit, and for SpaceX to land and recycle the rocket's booster — the biggest and most expensive part of the Falcon 9.</p>\n<p>Once inside the rocket, however, the fuel begins to warm up, expand, and boil off. That fuel loss starts the launch clock ticking.</p>\n<p>\"That changes how much performance you get carrying into orbit, and we don't want to cut into those margins,\" Insprucker said.</p>\n<figure> \n <img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f3704c4e89ebf001f044f29?format=jpeg\" alt=\"spacex crew1\" height=\"2560\" width=\"3840\" charset=\"\"> \n  <figcaption>\n   NASA's Crew-1 mission crew members in SpaceX's Crew Dragon spacecraft (left to right): NASA astronauts Shannon Walker, Victor Glover, and Mike Hopkins, as well as JAXA astronaut Soichi Noguchi. \n   <p class=\"copyright\">SpaceX via NASA</p> \n  </figcaption> </img>\n</figure>\n<p>Essentially, any additional time the rocket sits fully fueled on the launchpad increases the risk of dangerous failure — a risk that is not worth taking when there are humans on board.</p>\n<p>So the Falcon 9 must launch at the exact scheduled second. If it misses that brief window with a satellite, Insprucker explained, the rocket can be detanked of its fuel and later reloaded with fresh fuel and cold liquid oxygen — a process that takes roughly an hour and a half.</p>\n<p>But that is not an option for missions to the ISS, which flies over Earth's surface on a winding path (due to its inclination) and at great speed.</p>\n<p>\"In the case of the International Space Station, an hour and a half from now, it's nowhere where we need to be to get to orbit,\" Insprucker said. \"In the end we can all look at Isaac Newton and Johannes Kepler for orbital dynamics telling us 'when do we launch?' that stuck us right in the middle of a period of bad weather.\"</p>\n<p>If NASA and SpaceX call off Sunday's launch attempt, they can try again on Wednesday night. According to <a href=\"https://www.patrick.spaceforce.mil/Portals/14/Weather/Falcon%209%20NASA%20Crew-1%20L-0%20Forecast%20-%2015%20Nov%20Launch.pdf?ver=PSffw0yUau2_ZMnSowUcWA%3d%3d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a forecast issued Sunday</a> by the US Air Force's 45th Weather Squadron, a midweek attempt would have considerably better weather with only a 20% chance of delay.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>This story has been updated with new information.

href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/spacex-crew-1-mission-timeline-nasa-astronaut-launch-2020-11\">first full astronaut crew</a> into space for NASA, on a launch system newly certified <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/nasa-certifies-spacex-fly-astronauts-crew-dragon-spaceship-2020-11\">for human spaceflight</a>. The Falcon 9 rocket is upright on the launchpad, a Crew Dragon spaceship secured firmly to its nose. The engines have been test fired. Four astronauts are anxiously waiting for the countdown — launch is scheduled for Sunday at 7:27 p.m. ET.</p><p>Since SpaceX's first human launch, a demonstration that rocketed NASA astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley to the International Space Station (ISS), the company has ironed out several wrinkles with its system.</p><p>In that mission, called Demo-2, the Crew Dragon spaceship's fiery fall through Earth's atmosphere wore away its protective shield more than expected. Its parachutes also deployed a little late, and then boats full of spectators swarmed the toasted capsule once it landed. Additionally, a few weeks after the astronauts returned, another Falcon 9 launch revealed that a nail-polish-like substance was clogging up vents in the engines.</p><p>NASA and SpaceX have worked quickly to correct these malfunctions, adapt their processes, and upgrade the hardware. As a result, the upcoming mission, called Crew-1, is going to look different from Behnken and Hurley's.</p><p>\"We're flying a lot of upgrades on this flight compared to Demo-2,\" Steve Stich, the manager of NASA's Commercial Crew Program, said in a briefing on Tuesday. \"So we continue to evolve and be safer as we move toward these flights.\"</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f737eed0ab50d00184ad122?format=jpeg\" alt=\"spacex crew1\" height=\"2560\" width=\"3413\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The Crew-1 astronauts sit inside the Crew Dragon during training.

This could have resulted in an explosion that would have rattled and damaged the engines — like a car backfiring.</p><p>So SpaceX examined all its engines for similar remnants of the nail-polish-like substance.</p><p>\"SpaceX and the NASA team looked across the launch vehicle for any other areas that might have a small passage that could get blocked by this similar masking process. And we cleared all that hardware,\" Stich said.</p><p>Separately, the engines also have new bladed, jet-engine-like turbine wheels that pump in the liquid fuel. The upgrade makes the wheels less prone to vibrations called \"resonances,\" which can damage hardware.</p><p>\"These wheels are a little bit more robust to the kind of throttle profile that the Merlin engines fly,\" Stich said. \"So we're happy to have that as a safety upgrade.\"</p><h2>New, long-lasting solar panels</h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f259b373f7370096d3f997b?format=jpeg\" alt=\"spacex crew dragon endeavour docked international space station iss july 1 2020 iss063e034054\" height=\"1780\" width=\"2373\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>SpaceX&#39;s Crew Dragon &#34;Endeavour&#34; spaceship photographed by astronauts Bob Behnken and Chris Cassidy while performing a spacewalk on July 1, 2020.\n<p class=\"copyright\"><a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/view-of-the-spacex-crew-dragon-and-japans-htv-9-resupply-ship-0\" target=\"_blank\">NASA</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>The crew of the upcoming mission, called Crew-1, consists of NASA astronauts Mike Hopkins, Victor Glover, and Shannon Walker, and Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency astronaut Soichi Noguchi. They're slated to dock to the space station around 11 p.m. ET on Monday after a 27-hour journey. After that, they'll spend six months on the orbiting laboratory.</p><p>Their Crew Dragon capsule will stay at the ISS for all that time, too. Keeping a spaceship in orbit may sound easy, but as it sits there, the vehicle gets doused in solar radiation and weathers extreme temperatures. In fact, the capsule Behnken and Hurley flew, which they named Endeavour, probably wouldn't have survived a full-length six-month mission in space. Its solar panels likely would have degraded significantly after 110 days in orbit.</p><p>So Resilience, as the new capsule is known, has a set of solar panels that can last 210 days (nearly seven months).</p><h2>New software allows the Crew Dragon to switch ports on the ISS</h2><p>Docking to a port on the space station requires the Crew Dragon to execute a series of complex maneuvers. But it might not be able to stay docked in the same place for the full six months. Unlike the capsule used in the Demo-2 flight, this one is programmed with the ability to move itself to another port in order to make room for other incoming spaceships.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f761fa80ab50d00184ada17?format=jpeg\" alt=\"crew dragon iss docking demo2 spacex\" height=\"1403\" width=\"1872\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The Crew Dragon docks to the International Space Station, May 31, 2020.\n<p class=\"copyright\"><a href=\"https://images.nasa.gov/details-iss063e021463\" target=\"_blank\">Chris Cassidy</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>\"It's getting a little crowded in space. And that's a really good thing,\" NASA astronaut Suni Williams said in a Friday briefing.</p><p>Williams is set to fly on the first operational mission of Boeing's CST-100 Starliner — that company's spaceship for astronauts, which was funded and designed through the same NASA program that gave rise to SpaceX's Crew Dragon. The Starliner is set to reattempt an uncrewed test flight to the space station in 2021, since the first test failed. That might require the Crew Dragon to move to a different port.</p><p>To relocate the spaceship, the crew will climb back in and run new software that should maneuver the Crew Dragon away from its original docking point, the Forward Port, and re-dock to the station's Zenith Port.</p><p>The flight is programmed to be autonomous, but the crew will monitor the process. They can manually maneuver the spacecraft if anything goes wrong.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5ebb5c6bfc593d4cfc62f946?format=jpeg\" alt=\"spacex crew dragon spaceship digital touchscreen docking controls international space station youtube sm\" height=\"506\" width=\"900\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>A person in a spacesuit uses SpaceX&#39;s training simulator for docking the Crew Dragon spaceship with the International Space Station.\n<p class=\"copyright\"><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdJDBHzJF8E\" target=\"_blank\">SpaceX via YouTube</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><h2>A fortified heat shield for the plunge back to Earth</h2><p>After Behnken and Hurley splashed into the Gulf of Mexico and a recovery crew pulled them out, SpaceX studied the toasted Endeavor spaceship up close.

losing his reelection bid, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-coronavirus-response/2020/11/14/61137f4c-25cb-11eb-8599-406466ad1b8e_story.html\">The Washington Post reported Sunday.&#160;</a></p><p>The president has not attended a coronavirus task force meeting in \"at least five months,\" a senior official with knowledge of the meetings told the publication. According to the report, Trump is no longer taking an active role in managing the crisis's response.&#160;</p><p>The report comes with coronavirus cases again surging again in the US, with the number of new cases hitting a record daily high of 184,521 on Friday, according to data from <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/us-map\">Johns Hopkins University.</a> Deaths are also continuing to increase, with 1,431 new deaths recorded on Friday.&#160;</p><p>White House spokeswoman Sarah A Matthews pushed back against the report, and told Business Insider: \"The President is regularly briefed about the coronavirus. The relevant information is brought to him on the big decisions, and then he moves forward in the way that's best for our country.\"</p><p>Trump was once a mainstay at the coronavirus task force's daily briefing, but the daily appearances were abruptly halted after the president suggested injecting disinfectant to ward <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/timeline-trump-musings-on-false-idea-of-injecting-ight-disinfectant-2020-4\">off the virus in bizarre off the cuff remarks in April.</a></p><p>In recent months the president pledged that no widespread restrictions would be introduced by his administration and has taken an increasingly less active role in federal government measures to fight the crisis.</p><p>Dr Anthony Fauci, the top infectious diseases expert on the White House coronavirus task force, in comments&#160;<a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/ominous-winter-ahead-us-covid-cases-surge-warns-fauci/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">at a Chatham House event</a>&#160;Friday, warned of a \"challenging and ominous\" situation with winter approaching and the disease continues to spread as people are \"congregating indoors.\"&#160;</p><p>In veiled criticism of Trump, Fauci said that the US had reopened too early after an initial peak of the disease in spring, adding \"when we tried to open the economy and open the country again we did it in a disparate way. We didn't have uniform adherence to the guidelines.\"&#160;</p><p>Throughout the pandemic, Trump has spread false claims and disinformation as he sought to downplay the impact of the disease and ignored or dismissed measures advocated by public health officials, such as wearing masks, to halt the spread of the disease. The disease has surged through the White House, with the president himself hospitalized for three days with the illness in September.&#160;</p><p>At a press briefing at the White House Rose Garden Friday, Trump hailed the development of a coronavirus vaccine by pharmaceuticals firm Pfizer which is expected to widely available early next year.</p><p>Trump has raged about the news of the vaccine being announced days after his defeat to Biden in the presidential election. On Twitter, Trump groundlessly claimed \"the Democrats\" and officials inside his administration had suppressed the vaccine to ensure his defeat.</p><p>The president's botched response to the crisis is seen as one of the key reasons behind his defeat to President-elect Joe Biden in November's presidential election.&#160;</p><p>Biden has pledged to renew the federal government's fight against the disease when he takes office on January 20. In comments on Friday, he demanded Trump do more to combat the crisis.</p><p>\"The crisis does not respect dates on the calendar, it is accelerating right now. Urgent action is needed today, now, by the current administration — starting with an acknowledgment of how serious the current situation is,\" said Biden.&#160;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read

With the country reporting more than 100,000 cases a day and more than a 1,000 deaths per day, the pandemic is expected to be much <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-10-28/covid-19-s-third-wave-is-the-worst-wave-yet\">worse</a> than it was in the spring.</p><p>People who are incarcerated are especially vulnerable, given their tightly packed facilities, poor living conditions and abysmal access to medical care. Yet despite the increasing danger, calls to decarcerate and free people have gone down significantly and policymakers have seemingly moved on.</p><p>For instance, in the <a href=\"https://buildbackbetter.com/priorities/covid-19/\">COVID-19 plan</a> released by Joe Biden's transition team there is no mention of reducing prison populations. Agencies like Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, are once again conducting raids and filling detention centers. In some cases, they are quite literally reversing prior measures taken to mitigate the spread.</p><p>For instance, 55-year-old <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/released-ice-detention-due-covid-nj-green-card-holder-detained-again\">Julio Colcas</a> was awaiting deportation after serving two years for a drug related charge and freed in the spring to reduce prison populations and prevent coronavirus spread in the facilities, but was rearrested last month by ICE agents. To save lives and protect public health, we need to free them all: release people from prison, and end raids and deportations.&#160;</p><h2>Prisons are especially dangerous during the pandemic</h2><p>Prisons are a tinder box for the coronavirus. Incarcerated people are packed in tight cells with hundreds of other people. New people introduced to the facility and staff going in and out can introduce and re-introduce the virus and spark an outbreak.</p><p>According to <a href=\"https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/07/us-prison-inmates-among-those-hit-hard-covid-19\">data collected</a> from March to June, the incarcerated population had a case rate of 3.3% nationally compared to 0.6% in the general population. More than 163,000 people have tested positive for the virus in these facilities and at least 1,300 deaths according to The Marshall Project.</p><p>According to <a href=\"https://www.ice.gov/coronavirus#citations\">numbers</a> released by ICE, 6,922 detainees have tested positive with 8 deaths – this number is likely an <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/how-ice-data-undercounts-covid-19-victims/\">undercount</a> however, as it does not count those who have died from the virus after being released or deported. We know that many ICE facilities across the US have faced outbreaks – like at the Farmville Detention Center in Virginia, where an overwhelming<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/23/politics/immigration-ice-detention-coronavirus-farmville/index.html\"> 75%</a> of those incarcerated tested positive for the virus at one point.&#160;</p><p>The way <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/06/15/877457603/as-covid-spreads-in-u-s-prisons-lockdowns-spark-fear-of-more-solitary-confinemen\">prisons</a> and ICE facilities have decided to deal with the pandemic is to subject those who have tested positive for the virus to <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2020/08/24/ice-detention-coronavirus-solitary-confinement/\">solitary confinement</a> — which is considered a form of torture. This adds an additional layer of stress and psychological trauma to someone who is already battling a deadly virus.</p><p>As a result, people have been fearful of getting tested for the virus because they do not want to end up in solitary. Quarantine and isolation does not mean subjecting people to punitive practices that further take a toll on their health.&#160;</p><p>Of course, prisons and immigration detention facilities already had an abysmal record on healthcare to begin with. Earlier this month we heard reports of immigrant women in Georgia getting <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/29/us/ice-hysterectomies-surgeries-georgia.html\">hysterectomies</a> against their will. At other ICE facilities, immigrants have been <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/ice-detention-immigrants-trump-california-toxic-chemicals-covid-a9668716.html\">doused</a> in chemical disinfectant causing serious burns to the skin. In prisons in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/03/california-prisons-coronavirus-covid-19-health\">California</a>, there were shortages of masks, sanitizer and soap. In <a href=\"https://www.themarshallproject.org/2020/10/29/lax-masking-short-quarantines-ignored-symptoms-inside-a-prison-coronavirus-outbreak-in-disbeliever-country\">some facilities</a> in New York, those incarcerated allege that symptoms are being ignored and staff don't always wear masks.&#160;</p><p>Still, despite the pandemic and their abysmal ability to control it – law enforcement continue to lock people up on frivolous charges. Nowhere is this more evident than in the violent response to protests; not only are police corralling people into packed paddy wagons at protests, they are also arresting people days and weeks later.</p><p>For its part, ICE has continued to conduct raids, approving a scheme that would allow agents to deport people without going through <a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2020/10/ice-expedited-deportations/\">a judge</a> - a process known as <a href=\"https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/ice-implements-july-23-2019-expedited-removal-designation.\">expedited removal</a>. While ICE <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/ice-halting-most-immigration-enforcement/2020/03/18/d0516228-696c-11ea-abef-020f086a3fab_story.html\">temporarily</a> stopped raids during the pandemic, they continued to transfer people across the country and deport people with symptoms – <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/10/us/ice-coronavirus-deportation.html\">spreading</a> the coronavirus across US localities, throughout ICE detention centers nationwide, and abroad.&#160;</p><p>Conducting deportations during a pandemic only increases fear amongst undocumented communities and <a href=\"https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2020/08/25/how-fear-compounds-covid-19-infection-rates-and-compromises-recovery-for-undocumented-immigrants\">prevents people</a> from seeking the care and testing they need. Undocumented people are at <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/09/01/905822094/undocumented-with-covid-19-many-face-a-long-recovery-largely-on-their-own\">high risk</a> for the coronavirus because they are more likely to work in industries where they can get exposed, live in crowded housing environments with multiple generations, and lack health insurance. ICE's actions not only directly spread the virus, they have ripple effects in communities across the country.&#160;</p><p>The coronavirus does not distinguish between who it infects, whether the person is charged or incarcerated for alleged violations of civil or criminal law. Many local jails <a href=\"https://www.insidernj.com/press-release/new-ice-detention-facilities-not-welcome-new-jersey-tri-state-area-immigrant-rights-advocates-say/\">contract with ICE</a>: the first person to test positive for COVID-19 in an ICE facility was incarcerated <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/hamedaleaziz/ice-detainee-coronavirus-released-fears\">at the Bergen County Jail</a>, which holds people in criminal pretrial detention as well as ICE detainees per its contract with the federal agency. Many <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/sep/22/california-inmate-firefighter-ice-deportation\">people who complete their prison sentences</a>, are<a href=\"https://www.ilrc.org/national-map-287g-agreements\"> ordered released due to COVID-19 vulnerabilities,</a> or <a href=\"https://documentedny.com/2020/10/21/cuomo-has-not-signed-a-bill-to-fight-ice-arrests-at-courthouses/\">otherwise released on bail and attending court</a>, are immediately transferred to ICE detention, either <a href=\"https://www.ilrc.org/national-map-287g-agreements\">per formal agreements </a>or by everyday \"<a href=\"https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/ny-nypd-ice-immigration-raid-detainee-20201011-pln5koqtnjdqzj3u4omku3imyi-story.html\">local police</a>\" work.&#160;</p><p>People in criminal custody&#160;are also often subjected to the same ill treatment and abhorrent conditions that ICE detainees face. Looking at these two groups separately can also create a false impression about virus spread.</p><p>Take the Wyatt Detention Center in Rhode Island for example: ICE <a href=\"https://www.ice.gov/coronavirus\">reports</a> that only 3 cases have occurred <em>among its detainees</em><strong><em>. </em></strong>However, there are currently 99 active cases in the prison as a whole. Reports that those detained at Wyatt were not given new masks frequently, limited mask wearing and poor sanitation prompted a federal judge to <a href=\"https://www.providencejournal.com/story/news/courts/2020/10/28/judge-frees-immigration-and-customs-enforcement-detainee-after-spike-covid-cases-donald-w-wyatt-dete/6053915002/\">release</a> an ICE detainee. In addition to this, it was <a href=\"https://www.providencejournal.com/story/news/courts/2020/10/28/judge-frees-immigration-and-customs-enforcement-detainee-after-spike-covid-cases-donald-w-wyatt-dete/6053915002/\">reported</a> that ICE detainees were not included in routine rounds of universal testing for the virus.&#160;&#160;</p><p>As the death toll continues to climb from the virus, we cannot forget incarcerated people in our demands to protect the population. As we push for further restrictions on gatherings and indoor facilities and mask mandates; we must also push for the release of people from prisons and jails to mitigate the spread of the virus – because no one is sacrificial.&#160;</p><p><em>Abdullah Shihipar is a writer who writes on topics of public health, race, class and other social justice issues.&#160;</em></p><p><em>Sophia Gurulé is an immigration policy advocate and public defender providing direct legal representation to incarcerated immigrants in deportation proceedings.&#160;</em></p><p><em>William Goedel is an Assistant Professor of Epidemiology at the Brown University School of Public Health.</em></p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/ice-arrests-covid-19-pandemic-decarceration-prison-third-wave-2020-11'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=ajogfEO_Ssc:NQ1xD768ntQ:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=ajogfEO_Ssc:NQ1xD768ntQ:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=ajogfEO_Ssc:NQ1xD768ntQ:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=ajogfEO_Ssc:NQ1xD768ntQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=ajogfEO_Ssc:NQ1xD768ntQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=ajogfEO_Ssc:NQ1xD768ntQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=ajogfEO_Ssc:NQ1xD768ntQ:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=ajogfEO_Ssc:NQ1xD768ntQ:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/ajogfEO_Ssc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 15 Nov 2020 15:09:00 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5fa9b302f7d1cb0019e3aa7a?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"2ea4325b80e4a8b96cda3c9636a9b408","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn60@2020_4/2020/11/15/21-54-34-025_0782559ba72d025f.webp","destWidth":1997,"destHeight":1498,"sourceBytes":101442,"destBytes":101442,"author":"insider@insider.com (Abdullah Shihipar,William Goedel,Sophia Gurulé)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5fa9b3061df1d50018219b4c?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn91@2020_6/2020/11/15/21-54-28-187_55eec5d62b54aeb9.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn12@2020_6/2020/11/15/21-54-31-271_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=ajogfEO_Ssc:NQ1xD768ntQ:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn100@2020_6/2020/11/15/21-54-31-378_f25037240df488f9.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=ajogfEO_Ssc:NQ1xD768ntQ:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn4@2020_2/2020/11/15/21-54-29-803_c29d1bc9f1ba7164.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn35@2020_1/2020/11/15/21-54-27-665_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=ajogfEO_Ssc:NQ1xD768ntQ:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn64@2020_3/2020/11/15/21-54-31-841_8beca48f08959c56.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/ajogfEO_Ssc":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn84@2020_1/2020/11/15/21-54-25-377_41b30689d95a5222.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605477242107},{"createdTime":"2020-11-16 05:54:02","updatedTime":"2020-11-16 05:54:02","title":"An air ambulance service tested the use of a paramedic using a jet suit to reach injured hikers","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/air-ambulance-service-tested-jet-suit-emergency-medical-use-2020-10","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f984624861cb70019936ab5?format=jpeg\" alt=\"paramedic mountain response gravity industries\" height=\"1311\" width=\"1749\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>A screenshot of the &#34;Paramedic Mountain Response!&#34;

Joe Biden's cabinet but offered to help the incoming president in \"any ways\" he could.</p><p>When CBS This Morning anchor Gayle King asked if the former president had an interest in joining his former vice president's administration in an official capacity, Obama laughed.</p><p>\"There are probably some things I would not be doing, 'cause Michelle would leave me,\" Obama said. \"She'd be like, 'What? You're doin' what?'\"</p><p>While Obama did extend an offer to help the president-elect in \"any ways\" he was able, he said that Biden did not need his advice. As Business Insider previously reported, there are <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/joe-biden-cabinet-white-house-staff-transition-president-elect-administration-2020-11\">a number of notable people who could show up in the cabinet of the 46th president.</a></p><p>\"I'm not planning to suddenly work on the White House staff or something,\" Obama told King.</p><p>Obama also said Sunday there were no \"factual scenarios\" that would prohibit the president-elect and vice president-elect from assuming office in January, though he said President Trump's <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-admits-loss-joe-biden-presidential-election-2020-11\">repeated refusal to concede and unsubstantiated allegations of widespread voter fraud \"disappointing.\"&#160;</a></p><p>\"It's been sort of par for the course during these four years,\" the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/barack-obama-joe-biden-republicans-challenging-donald-trump-election-results-2020-11\">former president said</a>. \"They obviously didn't think there was any fraud going on, 'cause they didn't say anything for the first two days.</p><p>\"But there's damage to this, because what happens is that the peaceful transfer of power, the notion that any of us who attain an elected office – whether it's dogcatcher or president – are servants of the people. It's a temporary job,\" Obama added.&#160;</p><p>The interview comes ahead of the release of the first part of the former president's memoir, titled \"A Promised Land\" and <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/first-volume-of-barack-obamas-memoir-coming-nov-17-2020-9\">due out on November 17</a>.&#160;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/obama-no-biden-cabinet-position-2020-11'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=OceaGddGEWo:0RRCD0UpYfM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=OceaGddGEWo:0RRCD0UpYfM:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=OceaGddGEWo:0RRCD0UpYfM:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=OceaGddGEWo:0RRCD0UpYfM:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=OceaGddGEWo:0RRCD0UpYfM:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=OceaGddGEWo:0RRCD0UpYfM:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=OceaGddGEWo:0RRCD0UpYfM:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=OceaGddGEWo:0RRCD0UpYfM:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/OceaGddGEWo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 15 Nov 2020 17:35:31 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5fb162b31c741f0019ac9dfb?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"2b4855711d1cfe1d0bb0efa7d25d5ae3","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn32@2020_3/2020/11/15/21-54-33-732_b66c79b6cfebd027.webp","destWidth":1333,"destHeight":1000,"sourceBytes":71952,"destBytes":71952,"author":"insider@insider.com (Connor Perrett)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5fb162b6402d49001924f055?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn55@2020_6/2020/11/15/21-54-28-709_28e7266a5fefdd5a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn12@2020_6/2020/11/15/21-54-31-271_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=OceaGddGEWo:0RRCD0UpYfM:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn88@2020_3/2020/11/15/21-54-29-655_1ef8966498a70054.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=OceaGddGEWo:0RRCD0UpYfM:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn87@2020_4/2020/11/15/21-54-32-604_6e2ed4d69a078993.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn35@2020_1/2020/11/15/21-54-27-665_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=OceaGddGEWo:0RRCD0UpYfM:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn64@2020_2/2020/11/15/21-54-29-439_63f4ba950b1a99bf.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/OceaGddGEWo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn38@2020_4/2020/11/15/21-54-25-255_649f5c5a30b38906.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605477242129},{"createdTime":"2020-11-16 05:54:02","updatedTime":"2020-11-16 05:54:02","title":"The science of why golf balls have dimples","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/why-do-golf-balls-have-dimples-tiny-holes-2017-8","description":"<div style=\"position:relative;

Known as the <a href=\"http://www.gatewayprogram.org/\">Gateway Program</a>, the project is a three-way initiative between Amtrak, New York, and New Jersey with an estimated cost in the neighborhood of $13 billion.&#160;</p><p>The federal government under the Obama administration had planned to split the cost with the states until President Donald Trump backed out of the deal in 2017, <a href=\"https://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20171229/POLITICS/171229921/trump-administration-kills-gateway-tunnel-deal\">Crain's New York Business</a> reported, rejecting it as a local issue. It was just one of many tiffs between the federal government and New York during the Trump administration with the president and governor openly attacking each other on various occasions.&#160;</p><p>Trump had later approved $766 million in funds for one of the program's goals, building a new bridge to carry tracks over the Hackensack River located entirely in New Jersey, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/city-hall/whiteboard/2020/06/19/trump-administration-pledges-766m-for-stalled-gateway-rail-bridge-1294035\">Politico</a> reported. The tunnel portion remained untouched until Trump expressed interest in funding the program in May as part of an infrastructure-focused pandemic stimulus package that did not come to fruition.&#160;</p><p>Completion of the tunnel project would take around seven to eight years from its start, Cuomo said in a <a href=\"https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-sends-video-president-trump-exposing-gateway-tunnel-corrosion-and-damage\">video</a> to Trump imploring him to fund the project.&#160;&#160;</p><p>A Biden presidency might see the federal government's backing of the project restored to pre-Trump levels. Construction of the tunnels would reduce delays not only for Amtrak passengers traveling through the region but also for thousands of New Jersey Transit passengers that commute to and from New York City daily.&#160;</p><h2>Expansion of high-speed rail</h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fa5c4301df1d500182196a0?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Amtrak Acela Express\" height=\"2653\" width=\"3538\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Amtrak is investing in the Acela Express line with new, faster trains.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Michael715/Shutterstock.com</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Biden <a href=\"https://joebiden.com/clean-energy/\">campaign website</a> promises plans to expand America's rail network to make it the \"cleanest, safest, and fastest rail system in the world.\"</p><p>High-speed rail has long been overdue in the US as European and Asian nations have all seemingly perfected the system.&#160;Only one Amtrak line has high-speed capabilities, the Acela Express between Boston and Washington, and even then, the trainsets are restricted to well below its maximum speeds on certain stretches of the line.&#160;</p><p>The task of expanding high-speed rail has been taken up by private companies and state agencies in Florida, California, and Nevada that will connect some major cities with new lines. Connecting nearby city pairs via rail would take travelers off planes for shorter hops, just as the Acela Express has done in the Northeast Corridor by attracting travelers away from the airline shuttles.</p><p>But that would require new trackage, additional trainsets, and the ability to compete with the airlines. Amtrak upped its competitiveness when it launched non-stop Acela Express services between New York and Washington in 2019, offering a two-hour and 35-minute journey directly into the hearts of both cities.</p><p>Biden already has a track record here as his work to secure funding for Amtrak in 2016 will see faster trains join the line. The Alstom-built trains are currently in testing and scheduled to arrive in 2021, though it could be longer, as <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/amtrak-new-2-billon-acela-trains-are-delayed-full-history-2020-1\">Business Insider's Mary Meisenzahl</a> reported in January.&#160; &#160;</p><h2>Resumption of long-distance services</h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fa5c42bf7d1cb0019e3a596?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Amtrak\" height=\"2184\" width=\"2913\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Long-distance Amtrak trains are money losers but carry a nostalgia factor that helps keep them running.\n<p class=\"copyright\">AJ Packer/Shutterstock.com</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Under CEO Richard Anderson, the former Delta Air Lines chief executive, Amtrak began cutting amenities on long-distance routes. The least profitable in the Amtrak system, these lines mainly served a small segment of the population that preferred train travel over air travel or wanted to experience the novelty of a long train journey.&#160;</p><p>Profitable routes such as the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/amtrak-why-so-expensive-america-train-system-2019-3\">Northeast Corridor financially prop up these routes</a> that political pressure prevents from being cut, according to the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/03/us/coronavirus-amtrak-cuts.html\">New York Times</a>. Anderson did away with dining cars on some long-distance lines in 2019 as part of cost-cutting measures to help stem the losses on the routes, the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/the-end-of-an-american-tradition-the-amtrak-dining-car/2019/09/21/d63cca3a-d888-11e9-bfb1-849887369476_story.html\">Washington Post</a> reported, in favor of an airline-style pre-packaged offering.</p><p>The coronavirus pandemic further impacted these trains as service was cut to <a href=\"https://media.amtrak.com/2020/08/updates-to-amtrak-service/\">three-times-weekly</a> on most lines. As the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/03/us/coronavirus-amtrak-cuts.html\">New York Times</a> reported, the temporary cuts may provide Amtrak with a way to permanently sever the unprofitable lines.</p><p>Increased funding to Amtrak under a Biden administration could result in long-distance trains being restored to their former glory, white tablecloths and all.&#160;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/what-a-joe-biden-presidency-could-mean-for-americas-trains-2020-11'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=OP_ZgGTYcyg:4z0o0yZbW0c:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=OP_ZgGTYcyg:4z0o0yZbW0c:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=OP_ZgGTYcyg:4z0o0yZbW0c:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=OP_ZgGTYcyg:4z0o0yZbW0c:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=OP_ZgGTYcyg:4z0o0yZbW0c:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=OP_ZgGTYcyg:4z0o0yZbW0c:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=OP_ZgGTYcyg:4z0o0yZbW0c:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=OP_ZgGTYcyg:4z0o0yZbW0c:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/OP_ZgGTYcyg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 15 Nov 2020 13:44:00 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5fa58f1ff7d1cb0019e3a442?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"fef16e437c87910d578b3e432bc37fed","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn16@2020_3/2020/11/15/21-54-05-073_58de27328e0b1468.webp","destWidth":2221,"destHeight":1665,"sourceBytes":128220,"destBytes":128220,"author":"tpallini@businessinsider.com (Thomas Pallini)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5fa58f1ff7d1cb0019e3a442?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn16@2020_3/2020/11/15/21-54-05-073_58de27328e0b1468.webp","https://i.insider.com/5fa5c434f7d1cb0019e3a597?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn71@2020_2/2020/11/15/21-54-23-304_d9de3d5551670b74.webp","https://i.insider.com/5fa5c4301df1d500182196a0?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn19@2020_3/2020/11/15/21-54-28-353_ced0b69d74fb6ed9.webp","https://i.insider.com/5fa5c42bf7d1cb0019e3a596?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn88@2020_6/2020/11/15/21-54-23-508_bfe46ad51197153b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn12@2020_6/2020/11/15/21-54-31-271_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=OP_ZgGTYcyg:4z0o0yZbW0c:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn99@2020_5/2020/11/15/21-54-24-643_722b0e6e8b6f6338.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=OP_ZgGTYcyg:4z0o0yZbW0c:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn7@2020_4/2020/11/15/21-54-27-528_875f1ff7eb41e8db.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn35@2020_1/2020/11/15/21-54-27-665_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=OP_ZgGTYcyg:4z0o0yZbW0c:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn59@2020_3/2020/11/15/21-54-33-250_7ad1cbf1b306073a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/OP_ZgGTYcyg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn23@2020_5/2020/11/15/21-54-26-726_e7886d4b206edd32.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605477242133},{"createdTime":"2020-11-16 05:54:02","updatedTime":"2020-11-16 05:54:02","title":"Warren Buffett once compared himself to Mike Tyson and sold life insurance to the boxing champion","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/warren-buffett-compared-mike-tyson-marketable-skills-life-insurer-2020-11","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5faeb512402d49001924ecf7?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Warren Buffett and Mike Tyson\" height=\"454\" width=\"909\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">AP Photo/Nati Harnik;

the shots.</p><p>The vaccine — which Pfizer <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/pfizer-coronavirus-vaccine-success-plans-for-emergency-approval-fda-2020-9\">announced last week</a> is more than 90% effective in preventing COVID-19 in late stage human trials — <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/vaccine-cold-chain-why-coronavirus-shot-needs-to-be-cold-2020-11\">must be kept at -94

The temperature is well below the average 36 degrees required for most vaccines, and far colder than a regular freezer temperature of 0 degrees.&#160;&#160;</p><p>While Pfizer has proposed shipping the vaccines to healthcare providers using special dry ice briefcases, most hospitals aren't equipped with cold enough freezers to store the two-shot courses. As a result, states have started panic-buying hyper-cold freezers to prepare for mass deployment of the shots.&#160;</p><p>Makers of these specialty freezers are anticipating months-long backorders and delays for the products — which retail at anywhere from $5,000 to $15,000 — due to unprecedented demand, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-freezers-focus/u-s-states-race-to-buy-ultra-cold-vaccine-freezers-fueling-supply-worries-idUSKBN27T2S6\">Reuters reported.&#160;</a></p><p>The wave of purchases comes even as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention instructed hospitals in August not to purchase the freezers, instead insisting it was working on its own storage solutions for the vaccine rollout.</p><p>On Thursday, a CDC spokeswoman said the first batch of the vaccines will be available in limited quantities and administered quickly, which could lessen the necessity of hyper-cold freezers. Still, that hasn't stopped states from rushing to buy freezers, marking what Reuters said is \"widespread wariness of the advice from the CDC,\" as the organization continues to face increased scrutiny</p><p>\"I would estimate that a third of states are purchasing ultra cold storage equipment,\" Claire Hannan, executive director of the Association of Immunization Managers, a nonprofit handling the vaccines, told Reuters.&#160;</p><p>The lack of proper storage has also prompted some lawmakers, including Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, to request federal funding to help cover the cost of the specialty freezers. At least six states thus far have written official statements to the CDC expressing lack of infrastructure to store vaccines, according to Reuters.&#160;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/states-panic-buy-ultra-cold-freezers-pfizer-coronavirus-vaccine-2020-11'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=SYzUbLLwcZM:1ElRe8ez0g4:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=SYzUbLLwcZM:1ElRe8ez0g4:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=SYzUbLLwcZM:1ElRe8ez0g4:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=SYzUbLLwcZM:1ElRe8ez0g4:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=SYzUbLLwcZM:1ElRe8ez0g4:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=SYzUbLLwcZM:1ElRe8ez0g4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=SYzUbLLwcZM:1ElRe8ez0g4:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=SYzUbLLwcZM:1ElRe8ez0g4:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/SYzUbLLwcZM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 15 Nov 2020 16:44:32 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5f7b64fb94fce90018f7b29f?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"39185d3f3c2ea2dd6c5b4b7cee5ed1af","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn11@2020_4/2020/11/15/21-54-02-542_a757d8ec8e1fb0ef.webp","destWidth":3466,"destHeight":2600,"sourceBytes":545264,"destBytes":545264,"author":"insider@insider.com (Bethany Biron)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5f7b64fb94fce90018f7b29f?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn11@2020_4/2020/11/15/21-54-02-542_a757d8ec8e1fb0ef.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn12@2020_6/2020/11/15/21-54-31-271_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=SYzUbLLwcZM:1ElRe8ez0g4:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn35@2020_3/2020/11/15/21-54-31-585_637e25c0610df436.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=SYzUbLLwcZM:1ElRe8ez0g4:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn64@2020_3/2020/11/15/21-54-23-394_040eb4723ac1e9ee.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn35@2020_1/2020/11/15/21-54-27-665_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=SYzUbLLwcZM:1ElRe8ez0g4:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn76@2020_2/2020/11/15/21-54-31-318_146204d04e4387bd.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/SYzUbLLwcZM":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn63@2020_4/2020/11/15/21-54-32-536_cc7a4c4cd4a2a8d3.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605477242128},{"createdTime":"2020-11-16 05:54:02","updatedTime":"2020-11-16 05:54:02","title":"I'm a flight instructor in Las Vegas, where clients rent private planes for up to $1,000 an hour.

I would look up in the sky all the time, and was obsessed with trying to see airplanes.</p><p>I knew I wanted to go to college for aviation, so after high school I did two years in Arizona at a satellite school. In that time, I obtained my private pilot's license with instrument rating and my commercial license. Then I got my Certified Flight Instructor (CFI) and Certified Flight Instructor — Instrument (CFII) ratings, and went to the University of North Dakota to finish my bachelor's degree in commercial aviation.</p><p>I originally thought I would go into the airlines, and wanted to know everything there was to know about the commercial airline industry.</p><h2><strong>You don't need a college degree to become a flight instructor</strong>.</h2><p>First you need to have a commercial license, which requires 250 flight hours. Then you can train for your CFI and CFII to be able to teach others. Most people are flight instructors so they can make money while building up their flight time to become a commercial airline pilot, which requires 1,500 flight hours.</p><p>After graduating in 2007, I spent nearly 13 years in Scottsdale teaching and running flight schools. More recently, I worked with the Scottsdale Cirrus training center.</p><p>In 2019, I decided it was time for a change, and I took a position with All In Aviation school in Las Vegas. They'd just opened a brand new building, and I saw the job had potential growth.</p><p><em><strong>Read more</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/job-diary-professional-namer-paid-brand-companies-products\">How a 'professional namer' broke into the field of branding major companies and products, and his tips for choosing a name that sells</a></em></p><h2><strong>When the pandemic hit in the spring, I was worried.&#160;</strong></h2><p>Nonessential businesses had to close, but luckily we have a contract with the Air Force, and those government contracts are considered essential work. Our out-of-town traffic dropped off to practically zero overnight, so I began working from home on our ground school — a three-day crash course for new students.&#160;</p><p>It was a little slow for a couple weeks, but suddenly in April, people were coming out of the woodwork wanting to learn to fly. I was constantly having meetings and phone calls with people who wanted to learn to fly, so I started hiring more and more instructors.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5faaf64f1df1d5001821a02d?format=jpeg\" alt=\"carl may 2\" height=\"1836\" width=\"2448\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>During the pandemic, May says business has been booming.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Carl May</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Now, we have a total of eight flight instructors, three of whom I hired and trained during the pandemic. We kept chugging along and were blown away by the amount of business we had.</p><p>Our flight instructors have all been billing an average of 120-140 hours a month. In September, our flights hours were double of what they were in January.</p><h2><strong>As a flight instructor, my schedule changes every day.</strong></h2><p>Most training occurs during daylight hours so it's not uncommon to have early mornings, especially in the summer when the temperature is up. Most lessons are blocked out for three to four hours. We have a preflight discussion before we board the plane, then the training flight lasts anywhere from one to two hours, and is concluded with a thorough post flight briefing.&#160;</p><p>I typically see two to three clients per day depending on the length of the lesson. As a full-time instructor, I make myself available seven days per week and take time off as needed. I'm typically at the office Monday through Friday, and sometimes still find myself flying on the weekends to accommodate student schedules. Some students need night flight time so I just adjust my days to start and end later.&#160;&#160;</p><p>Our students range from teens to people in their 50s, but during the pandemic there's been an uptick in older clients, between the ages of 35 and 55. For many, now that things are a little slower at their job, they finally have the time to learn to fly.&#160;</p><p><em><strong>Read more</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/job-diary-interior-designer-who-creates-dream-luxury-playrooms-2020-10\">I design $100,000 luxury playrooms for the children of wealthy execs and celebrities.

He took his private pilot check-ride on his 50th birthday, and then a week later he flew to Cirrus aircraft headquarters in Tennessee to pick up his brand new turbo Cirrus airplane. He's going to put the airplane on lease back with us, and that'll be a new addition to our fleet. Including the VisionJet, we have 10 Cirrus aircraft and two Cessnas for 12 planes total.&#160;</p><p>I have another fun customer in his early 40s who owns his own business, and wants to learn to fly and own a Cirrus VisionJet. We've been all over the country with him, incorporating his flight training with his business operations. I did a flight with him and his wife where we stayed the night in Sedona, Arizona, and I had a $900 a night cabin to myself. When you aren't a pilot yet, unfortunately we can't just drop you off somewhere and then come back and get you. That would be a charter operation and we aren't certified to do that as a flight school.&#160;</p><p>We added several Cessnas to the flight school fleet that rent at $215/hour to accommodate more price-conscious folks. Still, many of our customers end up gravitating to the Cirrus planes, which range from about $300 to $400/hour, for all their safety features. A lot of people see the VisionJet, which costs $1,000/hour to rent, and that's their end goal. It has a button called safe return that turns the aircraft into an autonomous vehicle in the event that the pilot has a medical emergency.&#160;</p><p>It's been steady but intense growth over the past year. Traditionally summer months are slow months for flight training because it's so hot here, but all of our aircraft are fully air-conditioned, so that definitely helps.&#160;</p><h2><strong>The best part of flying and being an instructor is helping my students achieve their goals in aviation.</strong></h2><p>Every day and lesson is different, and I enjoy creating personal relationships with trust and respect. Most flight instructors teach for a short time as a means to the airlines, so my advice for other pilots and instructors is to practice patience and enjoy the process. Remember to live in the present, and respect everyone you meet. It's a small industry, and you never know when you may cross paths with someone again.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/job-diary-las-vegas-flight-instructor-private-plane-travel-2020-11'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=o5NDIrIVnxY:mkgaZY67E3w:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=o5NDIrIVnxY:mkgaZY67E3w:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=o5NDIrIVnxY:mkgaZY67E3w:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=o5NDIrIVnxY:mkgaZY67E3w:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=o5NDIrIVnxY:mkgaZY67E3w:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=o5NDIrIVnxY:mkgaZY67E3w:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=o5NDIrIVnxY:mkgaZY67E3w:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=o5NDIrIVnxY:mkgaZY67E3w:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/o5NDIrIVnxY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 15 Nov 2020 14:23:00 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5faaf699f7d1cb0019e3af59?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"13849af747cbc6ef2c23bd0886688c11","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn13@2020_3/2020/11/15/21-54-02-521_70f8b680148b1896.webp","destWidth":1940,"destHeight":1457,"sourceBytes":131820,"destBytes":131820,"author":"insider@insider.com (Amber Gibson)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5faaf699f7d1cb0019e3af59?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn13@2020_3/2020/11/15/21-54-02-521_70f8b680148b1896.webp","https://i.insider.com/5faaf64f1df1d5001821a02d?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn55@2020_2/2020/11/15/21-54-33-220_272a3fd52c69d589.webp","https://i.insider.com/5faaf608f7d1cb0019e3af53?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn99@2020_5/2020/11/15/21-54-26-549_50a92de140d7b209.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn12@2020_6/2020/11/15/21-54-31-271_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=o5NDIrIVnxY:mkgaZY67E3w:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn91@2020_2/2020/11/15/21-54-25-418_1637c30d7c6dfe99.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=o5NDIrIVnxY:mkgaZY67E3w:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn3@2020_5/2020/11/15/21-54-23-394_e90b4b0ef5e9711e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn35@2020_1/2020/11/15/21-54-27-665_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=o5NDIrIVnxY:mkgaZY67E3w:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn8@2020_3/2020/11/15/21-54-32-951_a4f84edc6be44350.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/o5NDIrIVnxY":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn67@2020_5/2020/11/15/21-54-23-228_a6d33854cea2c5ce.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605477242113},{"createdTime":"2020-11-16 05:54:02","updatedTime":"2020-11-16 05:54:02","title":"9 ways to stay connected and motivated while working from home this winter","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/ways-to-stay-connected-when-working-from-home-this-winter-2020-11","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5e5968a9fee23d1485730b93?format=jpeg\" alt=\"working from home laptop\" height=\"1414\" width=\"2121\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>It can be difficult to escape remote work when socially distanced gatherings, exercise, and outdoor dining are closed for the winter.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Justin Lewis/Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>The first pandemic winter might feel especially challenging for those working from home, but building habits now can fend off loneliness and keep up motivation.</li>\n<li>With limited interactions throughout the day, microsteps like starting a group chat or scheduling a virtual hangout with friends can significantly improve your mood and help you stay connected.</li>\n<li>Other habits like switching up your video calls, mapping out your day, or performing time audits can help you prioritize and stay motivated.&#160;</li>\n<li>Above all, remember to make a conscious effort to take care of yourself.

We'll be sharing hundreds of them in our forthcoming book, \"<a href=\"https://www.hachettebooks.com/titles/marina-khidekel/your-time-to-thrive/9780306875137/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Your Time to Thrive: End Burnout, Increase Well-Being, and Unlock Your Full Potential With the New Science of Microsteps</a>,\" which will be published by Hachette Go in March 2021.</p><p>The challenges are interconnected, and so are the solutions. When you take microsteps that support your well-being in your personal life, you're also making an investment in yourself that helps you stay motivated and be more successful at work. (If you're stressed out of your mind, you're not going to be as productive!)</p><p>Here are nine microsteps you can take to help you fend off loneliness, find motivation, and prioritize your well-being despite the wintry challenges ahead.</p><section><h2>Stay connected</h2><p>Loneliness, isolation, and the attendant mental health challenges have been major byproducts of the pandemic. For the&#160;<a href=\"https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2018/families.html\">35.7 million Americans who live alone</a>, the prospect of a lonely winter may seem particularly bleak. Social connectedness is tied to both our physical and mental health; when we interact and engage with others we&#160;<a href=\"https://www.uchealth.com/en/media-room/covid-19/social-connection\">experience</a>&#160;less stress, more happiness, a stronger immune system, higher motivation to take care of ourselves, and even improved memory and cognitive skills.</p><p>It takes a little creativity, but we can start taking small steps to maintain and strengthen our relationships — with both personal and professional benefits.</p></section><h3>Microstep 1: Start a group text with friends</h3><p>Science shows there's power in consistent kinship, even if it's a simple daily \"thinking of you\" message. Send that silly photo you took of your dog to your college friends or reach out to your old trivia crew when you come across something that reminds you of those geography rounds that always seemed to be your team's downfall. Remind your friends you care, and they'll remind you back.</p><h3>Microstep 2: Schedule a virtual coffee break with a friend</h3><p>Social isolation can have powerful negative effects on your health, but spending time with others — even virtually — helps you stay connected. So when you're feeling lonely, put a remote coffee date or catch-up session on the calendar. Or do it preemptively, <em>before&#160;</em>you start feeling isolated.</p><h3>Microstep 3: Ask someone what they're doing to take care of themselves and stay connected to loved ones</h3><p>Social distancing can make us feel further apart, not just physically but emotionally. Bridge the distance with this simple question — you might learn something, or find you have something in common.</p><p><em><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-ask-for-extension-work-deadline-email-template\">The best way to ask for an extension on a work deadline — plus the email you should send to your boss to get the conversation started</a></em></p><section><h2>Establish habits that keep you motivated and productive</h2><p>Those of us who thought working from home would lift us to new heights of productivity, focus, and accomplishment — well, we know how that turned out. Sure, working from home has its perks (goodbye, stressful commute!). But without the guardrails of going into the office and coming home, we've found ourselves in a world of boundaryless permawork — with <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/papers/w27612\">longer days and more meetings</a> — and are dealing with the <a href=\"https://www.themuse.com/advice/work-from-home-burnout-coronavirus-pandemic\">burnout</a>&#160;that comes with it. Our days are filled with back-to-back Zoom calls, little or no in-person interaction with coworkers, and more distractions at home from partners, kids, pets, and that pile of clothes we absolutely&#160;<em>must</em>&#160;sort before turning to our next work task.</p><p>Even though we're&#160;<em>doing&#160;</em>more, it can feel like we're getting less done. The endless distractions, coupled with the stress and uncertainty around the pandemic, make it really hard to stay motivated and productive. And it's not some kind of personal failure, it's because of the way our brains are wired. The brain's prefrontal cortex — responsible for critical thinking, decision making, and focus — actually shuts down during times of stress and uncertainty, and the more impulsive, reactive parts take over. <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/science-tech/coronavirus/2020/05/how-focus-concentration-pandemic-brain-motivation-apps-pomodoro\">According to Amy Arnsten</a>, a neuroscience and psychology professor at Yale, the ongoing danger of the virus can cause a cycle of stress responses that make it hard to concentrate and find motivation, which isn't exactly a boon for our productivity.</p><p>Whether we're working from home or going to an office this winter, these microsteps are great for making the most of our time and doing our best work. (And you can read more&#160;<a href=\"https://www.themuse.com/advice/work-from-home-work-life-balance\">here</a>&#160;about working from home without working&#160;<em>all</em>&#160;the time.)</p></section><h3>Microstep 4: Every morning, write down the top three things you want to accomplish that day</h3><p>Relentless prioritization is more critical than ever. Give yourself structure and clarity by focusing on three objectives every day — and when they're done, you can declare an end to your work day, knowing you'll come back tomorrow recharged.</p><h3>Microstep 5: Switch one video meeting to a phone call each day</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2020/07/08/future-work-good-challenging-unknown/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Research</a>&#160;has found that the sustained concentration required in video meetings means back-to-back Zoom calls will quickly tire you out and add stress to your day. Swapping one out for a phone call will give your eyes a break, and you can even pair the screen-free chat with a short walk around the neighborhood (or just around your room) to introduce movement into your day. (Looking for some other alternatives to video meetings? You can find several more&#160;<a href=\"https://www.themuse.com/advice/video-meeting-alternatives-combat-zoom-fatigue\">here</a>.)</p><h3>Microstep 6: Do a time audit</h3><p>At the end of the day, take two minutes to reflect on how you spent your time on work, family, household, and yourself. This exercise is an eye-opening way to look at your use of time and how you might make small improvements.</p><p>When I did my&#160;<em>own</em>&#160;time audit, I realized that my habit of starting each morning by looking at my phone right when I woke up was taking a serious toll. I never liked the feeling I got when I did this, but when the pandemic hit, I realized I was experiencing a palpable spike of anxiety each morning—a shortness of breath that took hours to go away. I was starting the day focused on what was important to others or going down a rabbit hole of stressful news, rather than focusing on what&#160;<em>I</em>&#160;wanted out of my day.</p><p>So I vowed to not check my phone for at least one minute after waking (see...micro!). Instead I decided I would take a few deep breaths and set my intentions for the day, and maybe even wait until I'd taken a shower to unlock my phone. Those quiet moments have become a calm respite for me (no more daily anxiety spike), allowing some creative work ideas to bubble to the surface. And the benefits carry over into the rest of my day in the way I interact with colleagues and what I choose to prioritize.</p><p><em><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/linkedin-support-your-working-parents-during-the-pandemic-2020-9\">Working parents are burnt out from working at home and taking care of their kids. A manager at LinkedIn shares 4 ways companies should support their changing needs and what's working at LinkedIn.</a></em></p><section><h2>Make sure you're not forsaking self-care — and fun!</h2><p>We can't do our best work if we don't take care of ourselves. This might sound obvious, until you consider how our collective definition of success is pretty much synonymous with sacrificing our well-being, celebrating hustle culture and burnout, and generally running ourselves into the ground. But this approach to success wasn't working before the pandemic, and it&#160;<em>definitely&#160;</em>isn't working now.</p><p>So by all means, work hard, chase your ambitions, and be grateful for your opportunities. And know that when you prioritize self-care, you're not stepping away from your goals — you're fueling yourself so you can get where you want to go.</p></section><h3>Microstep 7: Set time on your calendar to focus on small passions each week</h3><p>Make some time in your schedule to do something you love, even if it's just for a few minutes. And stick to it. You wouldn't miss an important meeting or doctor's appointment, so treat this time with the same respect. You'll begin to build the muscle of prioritizing the things that bring you joy.</p><p>Play an instrument, paint, write poetry, pull out your favorite video game, try a new recipe, look at the stars — whatever it is that fills you with joy, or purpose, or both. You might feel at first like you're being bad — taking a few minutes for yourself, the horror! But in fact, <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2019/11/the-unexpected-benefits-of-pursuing-a-passion-outside-of-work\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">studies show</a>&#160;that pursuing passions outside your work can have benefits for your personal life&#160;<em>and</em>&#160;your career. (Read more about finding a hobby you love&#160;<a href=\"https://www.themuse.com/advice/how-to-find-a-hobby-you-love\">here</a>.)</p><h3>Microstep 8: Identify one source of negative stress in your day</h3><p>Before you can solve a problem, you have to name it. Pinpoint just one experience or scenario in your daily life that routinely creates negative stress. Interactions with a certain person? A moment in your day that always seems to be rushed and unpleasant? Once you recognize a pattern, you can begin to take steps to prevent stress from becoming cumulative and unmanageable — like taking a few breaths to reset, clarifying expectations with your colleague whose meetings tend to stress you out, or rearranging your schedule to smooth stressful transitions.</p><h3>Microstep 9: Do one small thing each morning that brings you joy</h3><p>How you begin your day can set the tone for the rest of it — so make a conscious effort to do something that will start you off right. It might be meditating, walking, reading while you drink your coffee, making a breakfast you love, or trading stories about weird dreams with your kids. From this foundation, you'll build up strength and resilience for the rest of your day — and the rest of this unusual winter.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

Firstly, it gives them broad authority to decide how to moderate content on their platforms. Secondly, it shields them from liability for what users post. It has been incredibly influential in giving the Big Tech companies the power they wield today, and has been referred to as <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-twenty-six-words-that-created-the-internet-review-protecting-the-providers-11566255518\">\"the 26 words that created the internet.\"</a></p><p>Over the course of the last year, Trump has threatened to revoke Section 230 because he believes the tech companies use their moderating authority to suppress conservative views. In May, he <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-signs-executive-order-threatening-twitter-facebook-conservative-bias-2020-5?r=eo-landing\">signed an executive order</a> instructing federal regulators to amend Section 230, which resulted in the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/doj-asks-congress-to-weaken-section-230-2020-9\">DOJ proposing legislation to Congress</a> in September and the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/fcc-section-230-reform-trump-puppet-ajit-pai-2020-10\">FCC promising to examine the law's interpretation in October</a>.</p><p>Biden has also voiced support for repealing Section 230, although his focus is on harmful content rather than censorship. In an interview with the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/01/17/opinion/joe-biden-nytimes-interview.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share\">New York Times</a> in January, Biden said the law should be \"revoked, immediately\" and highlighted the way misinformation can spread unchecked on platforms such as Facebook.

Scott Shackelford, associate professor of business law and ethics at Indiana University, said whether Biden will be able to fully unravel Trump's projects and pursue his own agenda depends on the outcome of the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/georgia-senate-runoff-elections-jon-ossoff-david-perdue-warnock-loeffler-2020-11\">Georgia runoffs in January</a>.</p><p>\"If the Democrats are able to gain control of the upper chamber, then they will be able to use the Congressional Review Act to roll back any new rules passed in the waning months of the Trump administration,\" he said.</p><p>More generally, if the GOP retains control of the Senate, it could make policymaking on Section 230 extremely difficult.</p><p>Eric Goldman, a professor at Santa Clara University School of Law, said: \"The Democrats and the Republicans disagree deeply about why Section 230 is a problem and how to fix it, and that partisan disagreement makes it hard to predict what reforms can get through.\"</p><p>He added that if the chambers are under the control of different parties, \"then only bipartisan proposals have a chance of succeeding, and those will be hard to navigate given the diversity of views about Section 230.\"</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f9aad2769331a0011bc5faa?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Jack Dorsey hearing screen\" height=\"2000\" width=\"2666\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey appearing on-screen at an October 28 congressional hearing on Section 230.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Greg Nash/Pool via REUTERS TPX IMAGES OF THE DAY</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>This division was clear to see in the most recent hearing on Section 230, which took place on October 28. CEOs from Facebook, Google, and Twitter all testified before Congress. While Republican lawmakers grilled them on specific instances of perceived anti-conservative bias, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/senator-chatz-section-230-tech-hearing-dorsey-zuckerberg-pichai-sham-2020-10\">Democratic representatives decried the hearing itself</a> and used their time to criticize the GOP.</p><p>The issue of harmful content could also be particularly rankling to GOP lawmakers. Shackelford said: \"It may be politically challenging to address in a divided government, given the extent to which removing Section 230 would encourage the likes of Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter to err on the side of taking down controversial content, disinformation, and hate speech that is often though certainly not always spread by right-wing groups.\"</p><h2>Don't expect anything til January at the earliest</h2><p>All four experts agreed we won't see any movement on Section 230 until after Biden is inaugurated on January 20, even if Trump decides to double down.</p><p>\"Even in the most optimistic scenario any final rule will be challenged immediately in court and be put on hold. Plus, any executive action in this context cannot fundamentally change Section 230, not without Congressional action,\" said Shackelford.&#160;</p><p>After his inauguration, it's likely that Biden will roll back Trump's May executive order, as it is focused on allegations of anti-conservative censorship rather than harmful content.</p><p><em><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/vice-president-elect-kamala-harris-push-back-big-tech-2020-11?r=ih-sub\">Big Tech should prepare for pushback from Vice President-elect Kamala Harris in these 3 areas</a></em></p><p>Goldman said rescinding the executive order would provide Biden with the most direct route for pursuing his legislative agenda.</p><p>June DeHart, an attorney specializing in policymaking proceedings at Manatt law firm, added: \"President Biden will issue Executive Orders, as well as work with Congress on legislation and utilize the full toolbox US Presidents have. He very well could roll back the Trump order since he has voiced concern that social media isn't doing enough to stop the spread of misinformation rather than censorship.\"</p><h2>Trump may have given Biden something to work with</h2><p>Richard Lawson, a partner at Gardner Brewer Martinez-Monfort law firm, said Trump's crusade against Section 230 won't be entirely useless to Biden. He believes the groundwork already done by the DOJ could end up being of use to the new administration – specifically a series of <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/file/1286331/download?utm_medium=email&utm_source=govdeliveryvery\">recommendations published in June</a>.</p><p>\"These proposals were carefully developed after extensive review and input from many different perspectives – government, technology, and consumers. This will provide a great starting point even for a Democratic administration to pick up the issue and develop it,\" Lawson said.</p><p>Specifically, he thinks the DOJ's proposals mean reforms to Section 230 could be folded into broader antitrust regulation actions.</p><p>\"[The DOJ] call for Section 230 to be applicable in federal civil enforcement efforts. This could be viewed to include antitrust efforts from DOJ, as well as consumer protection efforts from the FTC. If that proposal has any legs, you can expect to see efforts to include state attorney general enforcement as well. While a subtle change, this could have massive consequences, so I think you can expect a tremendous amount of opposition from industry on this issue,\" he said.</p><p>Goldman said Biden is also likely to take on Big Tech in a more holistic way than Trump. \"Unlike Trump, I don't expect Biden to punitively target individual companies in fits of vindictiveness,\" he said.</p><p>According to DeHart, the one thing we can also expect to see is the Big Tech CEOs being hauled in to answer more questions from Congress.</p><p>\"I fully expect more hearings on these issues, as opposed to fast action. Section 230 is controversial and Democrats and Republicans come to the issue from different perspectives,\" she said, pointing to a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing scheduled for November 17 entitled \"Breaking the News: Censorship, Suppression, and the 2020 Election.\"</p><p>So no matter what happens in January, expect to see more of <a

Most American workers receive only three days to grieve the loss of a close family member; some receive none.&#160;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f562fdc7ed0ee001e25dcaf?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Biden\" height=\"1334\" width=\"2000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Biden has shared the most intimate moments of his life, including the last moment he shared with his son Beau.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Instead, American individualism and the strong work ethic that runs deep for many means that people are expected to soldier on despite grave losses.&#160;</p><p>\"The American spirit is 'Well, you're supposed to pull yourself up by your bootstraps and go back to work and get over it and not complain to people.' And all of those things just make it harder to deal with loss,\" Umberson said.&#160;</p><p>\"We aren't collectively grieving right now,\" she added.&#160;</p><h2><strong>Biden could help the US heal&#160;</strong></h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f871f83ea23a5001903d566?format=jpeg\" alt=\"biden-floyd\" height=\"4000\" width=\"6000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Biden spoke via video link to family and guests at the funeral service for George Floyd in Houston in June.\n<p class=\"copyright\">DAVID J. PHILLIP/POOL/AFP via Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>By continuing to share his story, Biden has the potential to change the public discourse on mourning, according to Deborah Carr, professor and chair of the sociology department at Boston University.&#160;</p><p>\"I think he really has this opportunity to say to all people, but to men especially, 'It's OK to grieve. It's OK to grieve publicly. It's OK to grieve not on a set timetable. You don't have to be all happy and jolly six months later,'\" she told Business Insider.&#160;&#160;</p><p>In a <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2020/03/28/biden-almost-gives-out-his-phone-number-on-live-tv-during-coronavirus-rant/\">March interview with CNN</a>, Biden encouraged anyone struggling with grief to reach out to his campaign.&#160;</p><p>\"Seek help,\" Biden said. \"And when you don't have it, you've got to get help. And, by the way, call — I'm not going to give my phone. But anyway, those who have been through that, you can contact my campaign. I'm happy to try to talk to you. Not that I'm an expert but just having been there, I'm so sorry for you.\"</p><p>Biden's openness to talking about loss might encourage others to speak about their struggles. And speaking out could help them decide to get help.</p><h2>Public health and public grief&#160;</h2><p>Grief — and perhaps especially, <em>not</em> grieving — can have major consequences to emotional, physical, and even public health.&#160;</p><p>Dr. Eric Bui, a research director at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital, says that it can lead to chronic stress, depression, trouble sleeping, anxiety, loss of appetite, and unexplained physical pain.&#160;</p><p>\"Men may try to resist grief, but it's important not to ignore these symptoms, as constant stress can put you at greater risk for a heart attack, stroke, and even death, especially in the first few months after losing someone,\" Bui tells <a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/how-to-overcome-griefs-health-damaging-effects\">Harvard Men's Health Watch</a>.&#160;</p><p>One of the doctor's recommendations is to reach out to one's support network.&#160;</p><p>There's a saying in the therapy world, \"Grief shared is grief diminished.\"&#160;Perhaps that's why Biden continues to speak his mourning.&#160;</p><p>\"I think Biden's presidency could become a turning point in our nation if we could come to see grief and bereavement as a public health problem that's been unrecognized and invisible,\" Umberson said.&#160;</p><p>\"It's not that it hasn't been impacting our health and wellbeing,\" she added. \"It's just that we haven't been talking about it.\"&#160;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the

As if that stress weren't enough, we're now facing a global pandemic, economic downturn, and remote work transformation, which can make the prospect of asking for more money seem downright terrifying.</p><p>Are you feeling underpaid or way overdue for a promotion or salary boost, but the pandemic has you worrying if it's even worth it to ask? Have you taken on additional responsibilities during this crisis that you believe should be reflected in your compensation, but no one's even mentioned raises this year? If you feel this way, you are not alone!</p><p>As a career coach, I've coached hundreds of women on how to negotiate and ask for what they deserve — because remember, you won't necessarily get what you deserve unless you ask for it first. And these days the biggest question I get is: Should I ask for a raise <em>in this economy</em>? Since the pandemic hit in early 2020, we've seen mass&#160;<a href=\"https://www.themuse.com/advice/laid-off-coronavirus\">layoffs</a>,&#160;<a href=\"https://www.themuse.com/advice/what-is-a-furlough\">furloughs</a>, hiring freezes, and&#160;<a href=\"https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R46554.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">unprecedented</a>&#160;unemployment rates. It's easy to understand why this would make you pause and ponder before putting in that request.</p><p>Figuring out when and how to ask for what you need and want can leave you feeling unsure and uncomfortable, especially at a time like this. But while things seem unpredictable in the coronavirus job market, there's some good news: People are still getting new jobs, raises, and promotions. Take that in. Getting a raise during a pandemic is not impossible. And there are ways to figure out whether or not you should ask for more during this time.</p><p>When it comes to negotiation, the first three questions I get on the regular are: Should I ask for more? When should I do it? How should I do it? If you're wondering how to answer these for yourself&#160;during the coronavirus pandemic, keep on reading.</p><h2>Should you ask for a raise during the pandemic?</h2><p>The truth is that it depends. So what factors should you consider?&#160;<a href=\"https://www.themuse.com/advice/when-to-ask-for-a-raise\">This article</a>&#160;lays out some solid tips on when it's the best time in general. But what about during the pandemic? Taking into consideration the times that we're in, you'll want to be ultra sensitive to the circumstances and timing and be doubly sure that you tie your ask back to the value that you add.</p><p>Getting a raise — and deciding whether to ask for one — really comes down to five main things: company performance, your role and performance, your network and relationships, timing, and your financial situation. Let's dive into each one.</p><p><em><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-combine-many-skills-interests-increase-salary-career-potential\">You don't need 'one true calling' to be a major success. Here's how to make more money and a name for yourself by investing in multiple interests.</a></em></p><h2><strong>1. Company performance</strong></h2><p>How is your organization performing? Have there been layoffs, furloughs, or hiring freezes? How about restructuring and downsizing? Did your company institute pay cuts across the board, and if so, have those been reversed? How has your industry more broadly performed during the pandemic? Do you hear leaders talking about the challenges of forecasting future earnings, performance, and recovery in the midst of all this uncertainty?</p><p>If you notice there are conversations circulating internally about business sustainability or viability, you may want to pause on your ask until the company is more stable. \"It can come across as insensitive to still ask for an increase when the company is in survival mode,\" said career coach Julia Rock, founder of <a href=\"https://rockcareer.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Rock Career Development</a>.</p><p>There are, however, many companies that have weathered the storm and are doing well — for some, their business has even increased amidst the pandemic. If your company is doing well financially — hitting revenue goals, for example, and hiring new employees — it's well within reason to move forward with negotiating.</p><p>In short, this is the time to find out as much as you can about how your employer is doing and what leadership's priorities are. If you're noticing that more work is being added to your plate and the company is actually getting busier at this time, it could mean that business is picking up. It could also mean that the team has shrunk due to layoffs and the remaining employees are each having to crank out more to get the same amount of work done. Observation and research will do you well here. Look at recent news about your company and industry. Ask decision makers (or even HR) questions about how the company is performing.</p><p>What if your company isn't doing well, but you've taken on additional responsibilities due to the pandemic? Don't overlook this, Rock says, and remember that you may be able to negotiate for things other than pay if you've concluded that company performance is too poor to ask for a raise. \"This could be a time where you can negotiate something other than financial rewards in the interim until the company and the economy improve,\" Rock said. \"This could be something like a more flexible work schedule or comp time/additional PTO.\"</p><h2><strong>2. Your role and performance</strong></h2><p>When it comes to asking for more, it's important to be able to directly pinpoint how you've added value to the company and how your work impact is aligned with business objectives. If you&#160;<em>aren't</em>&#160;able to pinpoint these things, you may not be ready to ask for a raise. You can also take a hard look at how your responsibilities have changed due to the pandemic.</p><p>Here are some questions to think about (I'm sure your wheels are spinning!):</p><ul><li>Were you already in talks with your boss, HR, or other higher-ups about getting promoted or getting a raise before COVID-19 hit?</li><li>Do you have healthy and consistent conversations with your boss about your career goals? Are they aware of your desire to get a raise?</li><li>What have you accomplished in the last six to 12 months? How have your accomplishments contributed to the success of the company? Did you help re-envision company, team, or project strategies in the face of the pandemic?</li><li>Have you received positive feedback lately on your performance from colleagues, clients, your boss, or other higher ups?</li><li>Have you taken on more responsibilities or expanded your role during the pandemic due to a downsize in the team or changing strategies?</li><li>Did you fill in for a colleague who was out for health or caregiving reasons?</li><li>Have you exceeded expectations even despite all the stress of the pandemic?</li><li>Did you help your team and company through the transition from working in the office to working remotely? For example, did you train the team on how to use certain digital tools to stay efficient while working from home? Or have you become a leader within your team, helping colleagues stay motivated and productive so that everyone can meet their goals?</li></ul><p><em><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-negotiate-virtually-kellogg-mba-professor-expert-2020-7\">Virtual salary negotiations require specific skills and a smooth touch. A Kellogg MBA professor shares 5 tactics for getting it right.</a></em></p><p>If you proactively manage your career — by tracking your projects, metrics of success, and wins on a consistent basis — you might be ready to ask for a raise quite quickly. I recommend keeping a running list of your work accomplishments, revisiting and updating it weekly, and sharing your wins regularly with your boss so that by the time you get to asking for a raise, they're not confused or caught off guard.</p><p>If you&#160;<em>haven't</em>&#160;been keeping this list, don't panic! Spend some time compiling information about your performance (you can start by answering the questions above) and it'll help you decide whether you're ready to make an ask.</p><h2><strong>3. Your network and relationships</strong></h2><p>Having relationships with the right people at your company who will advocate on your behalf is essential to growing within your company. As you decide if you're ready to ask for a raise, consider whether your network and relationships are already set up to help you or if you should consider waiting and building these up first.</p><p>Your boss is first on the list. Rock believes having&#160;<a href=\"https://www.themuse.com/advice/how-to-ask-boss-for-regular-checkin-meetings-email-template\">regular check-ins with your manager</a> is the key to advocating for yourself and what you deserve. If they've been able to hear about your career goals and see your progress and the effort you've been putting in, the ask will go much more smoothly. \"I find that these conversations go a lot easier when your boss has been engaged with your work,\" she said. \"They will be more willing to advocate for your increased compensation and escalate to higher levels on your behalf when they've had a front-row seat.\"</p><p>So ask yourself: Have you been communicating with your boss even as you work remotely? Have you talked about your work, accomplishments, and goals often as the world has rapidly changed? Have you had a chance to make yourself and your work visible to other supervisors or leaders within the company? Have you been working with a mentor or sponsor from another department? Would all of these folks vouch for your performance in recent months? You don't need all of the answers to be \"yes\" to be ready to ask for a raise, but the more yeses you have, the better a position you're in.</p><h2><strong>4. Timing</strong></h2><p>What time of the year does your company normally give out promotions and raises? At some organizations, this happens at the same time as annual or semi-annual&#160;<a href=\"https://www.themuse.com/advice/remote-performance-review-tips\">performance reviews</a>; others decouple the two processes. And some companies are more open than others to off-cycle raises. It's worth consulting an employee handbook or looking back to any emails you may have received with this information in the past. You can also ask your boss, HR, or a trusted colleague how the company typically approaches raises.</p><p>If you were planning to ask for a raise and know that this time of the year is coming up at your company, then you're right on track to start preparing and planning your ask. If it's not that time of the year and the review process is months away, don't fret! You can still give it a try — <em>if</em>&#160;you think your company might be open to an off-cycle raise. Otherwise, this gives you time to prepare and plan. Asking for a raise isn't just a one and done conversation. Building your case methodically and having multiple conversations leading up to the right time of year could help you ultimately get what you want.</p><h2><strong>5. Your financial situation and goals</strong></h2><p>Ask yourself: Has your financial situation changed since the start of the pandemic? Do you ultimately need more money to sustain your lifestyle and take care of your household? Perhaps your partner was laid off or you need to allocate funds for extra tutoring or educational support for children learning remotely.</p><p>While it's not necessary to share this information with your employer — and, in fact, I wouldn't recommend you sharing — it'd be good for you to know for some extra motivation before you ask. And this could also determine what other non-compensation benefits (work from home, flexible work arrangements, PTO, home office supply budget, etc.) you may want to negotiate in addition to the raise, or instead of a raise if one isn't possible.</p><h2>Do you need a pep talk before you ask?</h2><p>Here's the real question, is there&#160;<em>ever</em>&#160;an exact right time to ask for more money at work? It might feel like the answer is no, but it's yes more often than you'd think. If you're adding value, exceeding performance expectations, and taking on more work, and your company is performing well, then you should definitely consider asking, even during a pandemic.</p><p>Self-advocacy is one of the biggest skills you can learn to grow in your career. It's time to shift your mindset about asking for what you deserve. Instead of thinking, \"What if they say no?\" think, \"What if they say yes?\" Think about it this way: If you don't ask, the answer will always be no!</p><p>Besides, even if your company does say no, that's not necessarily a bad thing. Negotiating for what you want is a super important and beneficial thing to attempt and learn from even if the answer ends up being no. Because now your boss and leaders know how serious you are about your growth and development at the company. That's never a bad thing. It also shows that you want to continue to add value and grow your impact at the company and they should compensate you fairly for that.</p><p><em><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-negotiate-raise-promotion-during-crisis-2020-5\">An expert negotiator and professor at Columbia Law School offers the best strategy for negotiating a raise or promotion during a time of crisis</a></em></p><h2>How do you ask for a raise during a pandemic?</h2><p>So you've weighed all the factors above and decided that it is a good time for you to ask for a raise — congrats! It's a big step and you should be proud of yourself. What's next? Follow these steps.</p><h2><strong>1. Prepare the ask</strong></h2><p>When going into this conversation, you'll want to be as prepared as possible! That means pulling previous performance evaluations and any additional documentation that demonstrates your value and work ethic. That brag sheet outlining your wins over the last six to 12 months (including what you did, how you did it, who/how it helped, and what the quantifiable results were)? You'll need that. You might also want to collect praise and feedback you've received in emails, on Slack, or otherwise.</p><p>Next, you'll need to know how much you're going to ask for and you should base it on market research. Do you know the going salary/rate for your position, industry, and location? Do you know what other folks with similar roles, responsibilities, education, and experience — at your company and elsewhere — are making?</p><p>As you're planning, put a script together so that you know what you're going to say. This is not the time to wing the conversation. Be sure to rehearse aloud and in front of a mirror until you are asking with confidence. Practicing with a friend over a video call to simulate what the conversation would likely be during pandemic times. Even just recording yourself on video will help you pick up on nonverbal cues you're giving that you may not even be noticing—smiling, eye contact, posture, and more can help you exude confidence while staying calm.</p><h2><strong>2. Schedule the ask</strong></h2><p>Once you've done most of the prep work above, it's time to send an email to your boss or the person that directly oversees your performance to schedule a meeting. The request can be as simple as this: \"I'd like to set up some time with you to discuss my performance and compensation.\"</p><p>Now that we've been working from home for a few months, you also are likely to have a sense of their weekly rhythm and can schedule accordingly — e.g. if you know they tend to be watching their kids in the afternoons and can be more hectic and distracted, you'll want to suggest a morning meeting. Or if you know that your boss tends to get bombarded with requests as the week goes on, try to pick a slot early in the week. In short, try to avoid the times when they tend to be more preoccupied so that they can be fully focused on the conversation.</p><p>A video call is best for these types of meetings so that you can see your boss's response and pay attention to body language and facial expressions.</p><h2><strong>3. Make the ask</strong></h2><p>To start off the conversation, share your appreciation for the opportunity to work at the company and your enthusiasm for being there. Then, go into how you've contributed to the company before and during the pandemic and share a few key examples from the material you've gathered about your performance as part of your prep work. Tell them what you are looking to make and why. By the end of the conversation, your boss should understand exactly why you are seeking a raise.</p><p>Your boss may ask you some follow-up questions, so be prepared to elaborate. But keep in mind that there's almost no circumstance under which they'll be able to give you an answer on the spot. They'll most likely need to speak to their own boss or other leaders as well as HR. So expect to hear that they'll consider your request and get back to you. Hopefully, they'll give you a sense of the timeline and stick to it, but be prepared to follow up if needed.</p><p>You might need to have further conversations about your salary expectations if you don't get the initial response you're hoping for, Rock says. \"Companies aren't typically willing to dish out more cash just because you ask nicely. Be prepared to negotiate if required,\" she says. \"Don't just let your salary request fade into the abyss.\"</p><h2><strong>4. Don't be discouraged</strong></h2><p>If you ask and the answer is no, this doesn't necessarily mean that it won't happen for you at some point. \"No\" could simply mean \"not yet,\" especially in this context. Your work performance, talents, and skills may be deserving of a raise, but there are always other factors, such as timing and internal policies. And a \"not yet\" is even more likely during this pandemic, when your boss and company may want to recognize your accomplishments with a raise but simply can't make it happen at this time.</p><p>Ask your boss what you can do to prepare for a raise in the future and set a timeline to follow up, check in, and discuss your performance to make sure you're hitting your goals to get that raise you desire.</p><p>Just because we're in an economic downturn, doesn't mean your career has to be. So remember that negotiation is a conversation, not a confrontation. Be prepared when making the ask and think two steps ahead for their response. Try to focus on the best-case scenario (instead of the worst). And commit to the process, not the result. You should celebrate standing up for yourself. It's going to be a bit scary, but you'll get through it and will come out even stronger, no matter what the answer is.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-ask-for-raise-from-manager-during-pandemic-2020-11'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=iJ6-BuoBfgg:ClbJDzvrmNo:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=iJ6-BuoBfgg:ClbJDzvrmNo:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=iJ6-BuoBfgg:ClbJDzvrmNo:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=iJ6-BuoBfgg:ClbJDzvrmNo:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=iJ6-BuoBfgg:ClbJDzvrmNo:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=iJ6-BuoBfgg:ClbJDzvrmNo:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=iJ6-BuoBfgg:ClbJDzvrmNo:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=iJ6-BuoBfgg:ClbJDzvrmNo:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/iJ6-BuoBfgg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 15 Nov 2020 14:07:00 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5faee7c1402d49001924ee78?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"b7d4e379ddef73f55b5bd1f76a20c9e4","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn84@2020_4/2020/11/15/21-54-23-374_89b389a952aed2ca.webp","destWidth":2490,"destHeight":1868,"sourceBytes":138798,"destBytes":138798,"author":"insider@insider.com (Latesha Byrd)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5f46d812cd2fec00296a46c8?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn96@2020_2/2020/11/15/21-54-28-886_4d1d75c2fc5ce498.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn12@2020_6/2020/11/15/21-54-31-271_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=iJ6-BuoBfgg:ClbJDzvrmNo:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn3@2020_5/2020/11/15/21-54-30-491_005c08dc5c9def2d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=iJ6-BuoBfgg:ClbJDzvrmNo:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn23@2020_1/2020/11/15/21-54-24-366_1ecde29261ec0aad.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn35@2020_1/2020/11/15/21-54-27-665_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=iJ6-BuoBfgg:ClbJDzvrmNo:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn43@2020_2/2020/11/15/21-54-27-873_df8f72c1519e19fb.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/iJ6-BuoBfgg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn28@2020_6/2020/11/15/21-54-26-695_583518a3c84e4164.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605477242140},{"createdTime":"2020-11-16 05:54:02","updatedTime":"2020-11-16 05:54:02","title":"More wealthy travelers are turning to private jets this winter for travel as COVID spikes continue.

Jet Linx, Flexjet, FXAIR, and Silver Air Private Jets are all reporting an increase in flights to the state that also saw a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/top-9-us-destinations-for-private-jet-flyers-this-summer-2020-6\">busier than expected summer season for wealthy tourism</a>.&#160;&#160;</p><p>Aspen and Eagle are the most popular points of entry to Colorado, offering direct access to the ski slopes and an idyllic setting for social distancing in the mountains. Winter travel to these destinations can also prove difficult due to the mountain terrain, especially at night or on longer flights to the East Coast where a fuel stop might be required, so flyers should be flexible.&#160;&#160;</p><h2>Florida&#160;</h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fac267d7f8f4200182a64af?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Palm Beach, Florida, \" height=\"1280\" width=\"1706\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Palm Beach, Florida.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Walter Bibikow / Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Florida is also once again topping the lists as a top destination for the wealthy, according to FXAIR, Flexjet, and Jet Linx.&#160;Palm Beach and Naples are the favorites in the Sunshine State and were similarly popular during the summer as Florida reopened before most.</p><p>The New York-Palm Beach route is among the most popular in the US thanks to a mix of private jet and commercial traffic. And even the president of the United States spends winter weekends in Palm Beach.</p><h2>Mexico</h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f5a3ab1e6ff30001d4e7ff8?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Cancun, Mexico\" height=\"1403\" width=\"1872\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Cancun, Mexico.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Shutterstock.com</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>The wealthy are also heading south of the border this winter to the Mexican cities of Los Cabos, Cabo San Lucas, Cancun, and Puerto Vallarta, according to Silver Air Private Jets and Flexjet. As the closest destinations to the US, Los Cabos, and Cabo San Lucas top the lists for the two firms and Mexico overall is the top winter destination for Silver Air Private Jets based on current bookings.</p><p>The vacation destinations are quick hops by plane from West Coast cities, making them popular escapes for wealthy Southern Californians and the Silicon Valley crowd. Mexico began welcoming Americans arriving by air sooner than most countries and became a popular destination for international travelers of all backgrounds.</p><p>Mexico does not require proof of a negative COVID-19 test for entry, according to the <a href=\"https://mx.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/covid-19-information/\">US Embassy in Mexico</a>.&#160;</p><h2>Hawaii</h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fac27307f8f4200182a64b5?format=jpeg\" alt=\"hawaii 1\" height=\"1419\" width=\"1892\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Maui, Hawaii.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Getty/M.

From Los Angeles, Sin City is often just a short 45-minute hop from any of the executive airports serving the region.&#160;</p><p>While the gambling and nightlife of Las Vegas is the main allure, natural attractions such as Zion National Park in neighboring Utah, the Grand Canyon National Park in neighboring Arizona, and Death Valley National Park in neighboring California are also just a few hours away by car and an even shorter trip by private helicopter.&#160;</p><h2>California</h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fac2a007f8f4200182a64c9?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Santa Monica Pier\" height=\"1668\" width=\"2223\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Santa Monica, California.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Shutterstock.com</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>And while some are looking to escape Southern California for the holidays, others are turning into their destination.

A veritable gateway to all that nature has to offer, Bozeman is just a few hours drive from Yellowstone National Park and the ski scene in Big Sky.&#160;</p><p>Just as it was in the summer, Montana is a popular social distancing spot and Bozeman has been increasing in popularity with the wealthy looking to escape the cities in search of fresh air and star-laden skies.</p><div

This year, the online-focused shopping holiday lands on Monday, November 30. Typically, it begins at 12 a.m. on Monday. Of course, Cyber Monday sales can start as early as Saturday morning after Black Friday.&#160;</p><p>As a continuation of sorts of&#160;<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/black-friday-deals\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Black Friday</a>, Cyber Monday gives you another opportunity to save on tech, home goods, clothing, and other deals that you might've missed while recovering from Thanksgiving dinner.</p><h3>What is Cyber Monday?</h3><p>Cyber Monday began as the online version of Black Friday, where online retailers offered big discounts to match their brick-and-mortar counterparts. Now, Cyber Monday is the biggest shopping day of the year, surpassing even Black Friday in terms of revenue and sales.&#160;</p><p>The \"holiday\" was created in 2005 as the online version of the brick-and-mortar-focused Black Friday. Previously, the main differentiation between Black Friday and Cyber Monday was that Black Friday focused on in-store sales and Cyber Monday on online sales. But as shopping habits have increasingly favored the internet, amplified by the pandemic, shoppers can look forward to a very online-focused Cyber Monday <em>and</em> Black Friday.&#160;</p><p>Cyber Monday offers a great opportunity to save on all your&#160;<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-gift-ideas\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">holiday gifts</a>.&#160;</p><h3>How long do Cyber Monday sales last?&#160;</h3><p>Though Cyber Monday sales once only took place on Monday, we've been seeing them extend to longer and longer durations, with more than a few lasting until the rest of the week. For instance, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/wayfair-cyber-monday-deals\">Wayfair's Cyber Monday deals</a>&#160;will take place all from November 30 through December 4.</p><p>\"Doorbuster\" Cyber Monday markdowns are often restricted to the day and available stock.&#160;When we know the end date of a deal, we'll list it next to the deal.&#160;</p><h3>What's better, Black Friday or Cyber Monday?</h3><p>With most Americans sticking to online shopping this year, the debate on which shopping holiday is particularly moot. Both events will be held predominantly online, and more than a few deals overlap. In fact, many Black Friday deals become Cyber Monday deals when the dates change.&#160;</p><p>If possible, shoppers should shop both holidays. We've seen different products receive better discounts on each day, and the deals that each retailer offers will vary.&#160;</p><p>Generally speaking, consumers shopping for big-ticket items, such as laptops, TVs, and kitchen appliances, can expect more opportunities on Black Friday. But for shoppers looking for last year's models, smart home gadgets, digital subscriptions, and gift cards will likely find more luck during Cyber Monday.</p><h3>What should I buy during Cyber Monday?</h3><p>If a retailer offers Black Friday deals, it's a near guarantee that it will offer Cyber Monday deals, too. <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-cyber-monday-deals\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-buy-cyber-monday\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Best Buy</a>, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/target-cyber-monday-deals\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Target</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/walmart-cyber-monday-deals\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Walmart</a> are some noteworthy retailers that we know will participate in the shopping event.</p><p>We will likely see massive discounts on some of our favorite direct-to-consumer products during Cyber Monday, such as retail startups like <a href=\"http://leesa-sleep.lvuv.net/c/196318/236769/4014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.leesa.com%2F&subid2=1573849987398ak730lkmylkmy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\">Leesa</a>&#160;and&#160;<a href=\"http://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=999&u=1088116&m=64892&urllink=www.brooklinen.com%2F&afftrack=1573849987398auml421969987398auml42196\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\">Brooklinen</a>. For some, Cyber Monday (or Cyber Week) will be one of the few times of the year when their products see major markdowns.</p><h3>Where can I find Cyber Monday ads?</h3><p>Shoppers in-the-know eagerly await Black Friday and Cyber Monday advertising to help guide their Black Friday game plan. Typically, storefronts like Best Buy, Target, and Walmart release their previews late-October or early-November.</p><p>While we don't know an official date when each retailer will release their previews, a smattering of retailers has already posted their advertising online, the biggest being Walmart.&#160;</p><p>Here are the most important ad scans currently available:&#160;</p><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong>While the electronics retailer has yet to announce any deals for Cyber Monday, shoppers can peruse <a href=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/376373/633495/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fblack-friday%2Fsale-ad&nrtv_cid=.nrtv_plchldr.&subId2=businessinsider&subId3=1723576131758193728&subId1=generalp;subId1=general\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noskim\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"40\" data-uri=\"99e3d4a7d37c4e5f13bd0619e3fdaf17\" data-bamx-link=\"z0t5ogbs3kq\" data-bamx-auction-start=\"Thu Nov 12 2020 13:22:40 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)\" data-bamx-auction=\"{\"auction_result\":{\"id\":\"1723576131758193728\",\"auction_id\":\"1722281017656475326\",\"tracker_urls\":{\"bam_box_impression\":[],\"bam_box_viewable_impression\":[],\"impression\":[],\"viewable_impression\":[]},\"redirect_url\":\"https://api.narrativ.com/api/v0/client_redirect/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbestbuy.7tiv.net%2Fc%2F376373%2F633495%2F10014%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.bestbuy.com%252Fsite%252Fblack-friday%252Fsale-ad%26nrtv_cid%3D.nrtv_plchldr.%26subId2%3Dbusinessinsider%26subId3%3D1723576131758193728%26subId1%3Dgeneral&a=1722281017656475326&uuid=ae42f81d-cefd-46be-8558-9bfffc199664&uid_bam=1722731300024901308&ar=1723576131758193728\",\"product\":{\"id\":11699335293,\"name\":\"Best Buy black friday sale AD Page\",\"url\":\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/376373/633495/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fblack-friday%2Fsale-ad\",\"image_url\":\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/Best_Buy_Logo.svg/2000px-Best_Buy_Logo.svg.png\",\"is_in_stock\":true,\"price\":null,\"brand\":\"Best Buy\",\"bamx_product_category_id\":1,\"merchant\":{\"id\":1125,\"name\":\"Best Buy\",\"canonical_host\":\"bestbuy.com\",\"url\":\"http://www.bestbuy.com/\"}},\"u1\":null},\"impression_pixel_url\":null}_in_stock&#34;:true,&#34;price&#34;:null,&#34;brand&#34;:&#34;Best Buy&#34;,&#34;bamx_product_category_id&#34;:1,&#34;merchant&#34;:{&#34;id&#34;:1125,&#34;name&#34;:&#34;Best Buy&#34;,&#34;canonical_host&#34;:&#34;bestbuy.com&#34;,&#34;url&#34;:&#34;http://www.bestbuy.com/&#34;}},&#34;u1&#34;:null},&#34;impression_pixel_url&#34;:null}\" data-bamx-auction-end=\"Thu Nov 12 2020 13:22:40 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)\">Best Buy's Black Friday Ad here</a>.

Watch how retreading machines make old tires usable again.</p><p><em>Following is a transcript of the video.</em></p><p><strong>Narrator: </strong>When your tire wears out, you take it to a shop where it's tossed out for a new one. The discarded tire is typically recycled — ground up and chemically broken down to use as a building material in streets or parks. Some companies hope to recycle differently. For years, companies like Marangoni have been saving tire casings, replacing the old tread (the rubber that touches the ground) with new tread in a process called \"retreading.\" These tires are not only easier to make — they typically take 20% of the energy of creating a new tire — they perform well too, standing up to the same tests that one-use tires are subjected to.</p><p>The main advantage of the tire-retreading process comes from reusing the casings, which accounts for about two-thirds of the value of a new tire. Reusing tires also cuts down on the amount of raw material used and CO2 emitted during the industrial production process.</p><p>Let's take a look at the retreading process step-by-step.</p><p>A worn tire that is to be retreaded comes into the factory and undergoes visual and instrumental checks. Integral to this step is a Laser Shearography device, a tool that scans the tire in a vacuum to detect damage or defects not visible from the outside as well as separation of the plies, the group of cords and metal wires within the tire. Tires unsuitable for retreading are not discarded, they are destroyed in a thermal processing plant that burns the tires in an enclosed furnace, converting the tires into usable energy without an enclosed furnace, converting the tires into usable energy without emitting harmful gases. The unburned material is recovered. Casings deemed suitable for retreading are tagged with a barcode and are ready to be buffed.</p><p>Casings enter a machine that buffs off the remaining tread. The amount of tread that's removed varies according to the type and size of the casing. The surface is now ready for the application of the new tread.</p><p>The buffed casing moves to the crater processing stage. Here it is inspected, and any surface imperfections are repaired. The buffed tire is coated with a sticky layer of non-vulcanized rubber or gum. A pre-vulcanized ring tread liner is stretched and fitted around the tire. A laser ensures the machine is centered on the tire, while clamps emerge and press the tread liner down. The machine holding the tread withdraws. Rollers emerge and smooth the tread liner to the casing.</p><p>Each tire is fitted with a rubber envelope and vacuum-sealed. They are brought to an autoclave, or pressure chamber, where each tire will be cured. The tires are simultaneously subjected to immense heat and pressure. The chamber heats up to 250° F and imposes around 88 pounds of force per square inch for two and a half to three hours.</p><p>Finally, a technician applies the finishing touches.</p><p><em>EDITOR'S

But thanks to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, travel will be a lot lighter this year.</p><p>With <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/12/average-covid-cases-and-hospitalizations-rise-in-nearly-every-state-across-us.html\">positive COVID-19 cases on the rise</a> and <a href=\"https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/ct-coronavirus-restrictions-roll-back-suburbs-20201020-6fhep6fodfdmpgbl5q7o26qdli-story.html\">renewed, tighter quarantine restrictions</a>, <a href=\"https://newsroom.aaa.com/2020/11/fewer-americans-traveling-this-thanksgiving-amid-pandemic/\">AAA believes</a> anticipates at least a 10% decrease in travel from 2019 — the \"largest one-year decrease since the Great Recession in 2008,\" it said.</p><p>AAA predicts that all forms of travel — whether via cars, planes, buses, trains, and cruises — will decrease this year compared to last year. Bus, train, and cruise travel will fall from 1.5 million passengers last year to 353,000 this year, a 76.2% decrease; air travel will fall from 4.6 million passengers to 2.4 million, a 47.5% decrease; and car travel will dip slightly from 49.9 million to 47.8 million, a 4.3% decrease.</p><h2><strong>Road trips dominate</strong></h2><p>\"Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including health concerns and high unemployment, are impacting Americans' decisions to travel for the Thanksgiving holiday,\" Julie Hall, AAA's public relations manager, told Business Insider. \"Those who decide to travel are likely to drive shorter distances and reduce the number of days they are away, making road trips the dominant form of travel this Thanksgiving.\"</p><p>So if you're the type of dread holiday travel traffic, you can expect less of it this year.</p><p>But those living in major urban areas won't be so lucky. AAA projects increased delays at typical bottleneck areas of \"up to 30% above normal pandemic congestion levels,\" Hall said, citing transportation analytics company Inrix's prediction that Wednesday afternoon will have the highest traffic volume.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fad6d08df90d000183781f9?format=jpeg\" alt=\"holiday travel 2020\" height=\"1826\" width=\"1880\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>AAA and INRIX&#39;s predictions for the busiest corridors during this Thanksgiving.\n<p class=\"copyright\"><a href=\"https://newsroom.aaa.com/2020/11/fewer-americans-traveling-this-thanksgiving-amid-pandemic/\" target=\"_blank\">Screenshot via AAA</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Just be sure your car is travel ready so it won't break down on the way. AAA said it \"expects to rescue more than 413,000 Americans at the roadside this Thanksgiving.\"</p><h2><strong>Know the risks</strong></h2><p>Knowing the risks involved is important to those choosing to travel this holiday.&#160;</p><p>AAA highly recommends planning ahead. Check with state and local authorities where you are, along the route you're planning on taking, and at your destination to find out about any potential restrictions that could be in effect.</p><p>And follow public health guidelines! Wear a mask consistently, follow social distancing protocols (at least six feet), and wash your hands regularly. Holidays can mean interstate travel and seeing relatives in close quarters, so it's worth bearing some caution in mind. Bring extra face masks, disinfecting wipes, hand sanitizer, and a thermometer so you can monitor your health.</p><p>If you're staying in a hotel, AAA recommends calling ahead to make sure it's open. Ask what precautions it is taking to protect guests, find out what the social distancing rules are, see if there are any capacity restrictions in common spaces, and ask if hotel staffers are required to wear masks at all times.</p><p>\"Also be sure to understand what amenities are and are not available to guests — room service, fitness center, restaurants, et cetera,\" Hall said. \"For extra peace of mind, wipe down surfaces using disinfecting wipes. In a hotel, that includes door handles, remotes, faucets and light switches.\"</p><p>If you are renting a car, be sure to ask the company what it's done to clean and disinfect the car between customers. And — just to be extra safe — wipe down high-touch areas such as door handles, steering wheels, shifters, control panels, and keys yourself with disinfecting wipes.</p><p>There is a silver lining through all this though: Those driving will experience cheaper gas prices.</p><p>\"On average, gas prices nationally are nearly 50 cents cheaper than this time last year, with October averages the lowest in more than 15 years,\" AAA said.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-road-trip-safely-during-coronavirus-checklist-2020-6\">For a complete guide on how to road trip during
