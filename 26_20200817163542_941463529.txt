The deal will allow artists on TikTok to tap into the platform&#8217;s ability to make their music go viral, then distribute their songs directly to other music streaming services, like Spotify, Apple Music/iTunes, SoundCloud, and YouTube.</p>\n<p>The deal allows indie artists to effectively circumvent traditional record labels by reaching young music fans on the social video app, then translate that to charting success.</p>\n<p>Already, TikTok has proven its capabilities in this area, having helped push little known or undiscovered artists to further growth, including Lil Nas X, Ambjaay, StaySolidRocky, Powfu, BENEE, Y2K, bbno$, and others, the company noted in an announcement about the new deal. Meanwhile, artists like Curtis Roach, Curtis Waters, Breland, Tai Verdes, BMW Kenny and others have used TikTok to promote their music. Some, like ppcocaine and Avenue Beat, preview original music directly on the platform. Several emerging artists, like Shuba, Blu DeTiger, and Kid Sistr, have even used TikTok as a platform for creative performances.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/unitedmasters\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"unitedmasters\">UnitedMasters, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> meanwhile, has helped launched the careers of artists like platinum-selling rapper NLE Choppa, plus Lil Tecca, Tobe Nwigwe, Lil XXEL, and others. In the past 18 months, it has grown its lineup to over 400,000 artists who have a combined 5 billion streams and over a half million distributed tracks.</p>\n<p>UnitedMasters takes a 10% share of revenue for music it distributes, and allows artists to retain their rights. It also works to facilitate relationships between artists and brands. According to <a href=\"https://unitedmasters.com/exclusives-home\">the company&#8217;s website</a>, UnitedMasters currently works with brands like the NBA, Bose, AT&#38;T, the NFL and others.</p>\n<p>TikTok says its new agreement with UnitedMasters will also involve promoting their artists on its video platform. That means artists will have more opportunities to reach new fans who could then, in turn, use the artists&#8217; music in their videos. TikTok will also add the music from UnitedMasters&#8217; artists, with their permission, to its Commercial Music Library. This catalog gives verified businesses access to royalty-free music for use with their promotional content.</p>\n<p>&#8220;TikTok artists who are creating music in their bedrooms today will be featured in the Billboard charts tomorrow,&#8221; said Ole Obermann, Global Head of Music at TikTok, in a statement. &#8220;Our mission is to help those artists achieve their creative potential and success. This partnership with UnitedMasters gives us a turn-key solution to help artists who are born on TikTok to reach their fans on every music service.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Trying to work around the labels is a tricky prospect, other music services have found. Spotify, for example, tried offering a tool that would have allowed indie artists to upload their own music directly to its streaming service. But the tool <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/01/spotify-shuts-down-its-direct-music-upload-beta-program-for-artists/\">was shut down in less than a year&#8217;s time</a>, after beta testing, as its existence <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-07-01/spotify-will-no-longer-allow-artists-to-upload-work-directly-jxkjtrbg\">complicated</a> Spotify&#8217;s label negotiations.</p>\n<p>TikTok, however, has different sorts of licensing deals with the major labels because it&#8217;s not a streaming service for music, nor a platform for watching official music videos, like YouTube and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/31/facebook-will-launch-officially-licensed-music-videos-in-the-us-starting-this-weekend/\">now, Facebook</a>. Instead, its music deals are reportedly shorter-term agreements than those the labels strike with other tech companies, a <a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/legal-and-management/9347970/tiktok-now-has-short-term-licensing-deals-with-the-major-labels\">Billboard report said</a>. The deals give the video platform the right to use 30-second clips of the record labels&#8217; songs, not full tracks. To date, many of TikTok&#8217;s music deals are separate from those its parent company ByteDance inked for its streaming music service, Resso. (A <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/23/tiktok-inks-licensing-deal-with-merlin-to-use-music-from-independent-labels-in-videos-and-new-resso-streaming-service/\">deal with Merlin</a> was a recent exception, however).</p>\n<p>Because of the complicated nature of these sorts of negotiations, it&#8217;s unclear how the major labels will react to what appears to be a way for TikTok to eventually route around their cut. By promoting indie artists to help them achieve viral success without a traditional label&#8217;s involvement, TikTok could become a launching pad for artists who don&#8217;t want a label deal. Instead, TikTok artists would gain access to fans and, eventually, the resulting revenue potential that comes with having a large audience.</p>\n<p>This likely won&#8217;t go down well with labels, who have already been pushing TikTok to find more ways to generate revenue for music rights holders, as Billboard&#8217;s report had noted.</p>\n<p>“If you are a musical artist, TikTok is the best place for your music to go viral and UnitedMasters is the best place to sustain it while retaining full ownership of your work,&#8221; said Steve Stoute, CEO and Founder of UnitedMasters, in a statement about the TikTok partnership. &#8220;By combining the two, we create the platform for tomorrow&#8217;s stars who will be famous, fiercely independent and wealthy.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=M0bZIFVUXNY:4GszB2fQ2pY:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=M0bZIFVUXNY:4GszB2fQ2pY:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=M0bZIFVUXNY:4GszB2fQ2pY:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=M0bZIFVUXNY:4GszB2fQ2pY:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=M0bZIFVUXNY:4GszB2fQ2pY:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=M0bZIFVUXNY:4GszB2fQ2pY:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=M0bZIFVUXNY:4GszB2fQ2pY:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=M0bZIFVUXNY:4GszB2fQ2pY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/M0bZIFVUXNY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 17 Aug 2020 14:33:49 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GettyImages-1177990254-1.jpg?w=616","linkMd5":"ee06ce5d819373ef98f5eb87f04341f2","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn59@2020_2/2020/08/17/16-35-40-773_81ebe42ca452b2fd.webp","metaImg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GettyImages-1177990254-1.jpg?w=616","author":"Sarah Perez","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn62@2020_2/2020/08/17/16-35-05-249_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn87@2020_5/2020/08/17/16-35-06-283_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn24@2020_1/2020/08/17/16-35-06-276_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=M0bZIFVUXNY:4GszB2fQ2pY:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn67@2020_4/2020/08/17/16-35-06-328_2e3dccb9908afef8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=M0bZIFVUXNY:4GszB2fQ2pY:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn15@2020_3/2020/08/17/16-35-06-333_6bc2138f3f09be02.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx17/cdn99@2020_2/2020/08/17/16-35-38-712_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/M0bZIFVUXNY":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn28@2020_2/2020/08/17/16-35-06-256_21aeed790854b24b.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-18 00:35:03","updatedTime":"2020-08-18 00:35:03","title":"US Commerce Department updates rules to further limit Huawei’s chip access","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2032316","description":"<p class=\"p1\">The United States Department of Commerce<a href=\"https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2020/08/commerce-department-further-restricts-huawei-access-us-technology-and\"> this morning</a> issued updates to a list of rules designed to restrict Huawei’s access to U.S.-based technology. The new restrictions follow a similar decree announced in May, finding the government department engaged in a game of international whack-a-mole as it looks to cut off the Chinese hardware giant’s access entirely.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“It amends our May rule and goes at the problem of Huawei trying to backfill it,” a Commerce Department official said, following the announcement. Specifically the new rules attempt to address a kind of loophole wherein Huawei was able to do business with third-parties designing chips based on technologies originating in the United States. The specific rule will arrive later today, but the move is a clear attempt to cut off Huawei from access to semiconductors &#8212; a goal Department is making no bones about.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Huawei and its foreign affiliates have extended their efforts to obtain advanced semiconductors developed or produced from U.S. software and technology in order to fulfill the policy objectives of the Chinese Communist Party,” Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said rather pointedly in a statement issued this morning. “As we have restricted its access to U.S. technology, Huawei and its affiliates have worked through third parties to harness U.S. technology in a manner that undermines U.S. national security and foreign policy interests. This multi-pronged action demonstrates our continuing commitment to impede Huawei’s ability to do so.”</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"AniuhsIrMN\"><p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/18/huawei-uncertainties-new-us-chip-rules-tsmc/\">Huawei admits uncertainty following new US chip curbs</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Huawei admits uncertainty following new US chip curbs&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/18/huawei-uncertainties-new-us-chip-rules-tsmc/embed/#?secret=AniuhsIrMN\" data-secret=\"AniuhsIrMN\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p class=\"p1\">U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also refused to mince words in his own statement, which referred to the smartphone maker as “an arm of the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP’s) surveillance state” and accusing it of “continuously [trying] to evade” U.S. rules.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“We will not tolerate efforts by the CCP to undermine the privacy of our citizens, our businesses’ intellectual property, or the integrity of next-generation networks worldwide,” Pompeo <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/the-united-states-further-restricts-huawei-access-to-u-s-technology/\">wrote</a>. “We are backing up our words with actions across the U.S. Government. The Department of Justice has indicted Huawei for stealing U.S. technology, conspiracy, wire fraud, bank fraud, racketeering, and helping Iran to evade sanctions, amongst other charges.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Huawei has yet to comment on these new regulations, but the company has consistently denied charges of spying and direct ties to the Chinese government. While it has long been a source of scrutiny for the U.S., actions against the company have greatly intensified under the Trump administration.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This latest round of rules adds to the ever-growing Entity List an additional 38 Huawei-affiliated parties from 21 countries. In <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2020/08/17/business/17reuters-usa-huawei-tech-exclusive.html#:~:text=%22The%20new%20rule%20makes%20it,%2Dthe%2Dshelf%20chips.%22\">an interview</a> with Fox Business, Ross acknowledged Huawei&#8217;s continued maneuvers following the May rule, pertaining to both hardware and software &#8212; the latter likely a reference to Android and other Google-produced apps.</p>\n<p>The rules &#8220;led them to do some evasive measures,&#8221; Ross told the business channel. &#8220;They were going through third parties. The new rule makes it clear that any use of American software or American fabrication equipment is banned and requires a license.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Sr9njk3xaf4:qwUWTXZCvo8:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Sr9njk3xaf4:qwUWTXZCvo8:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Sr9njk3xaf4:qwUWTXZCvo8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Sr9njk3xaf4:qwUWTXZCvo8:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=Sr9njk3xaf4:qwUWTXZCvo8:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Sr9njk3xaf4:qwUWTXZCvo8:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=Sr9njk3xaf4:qwUWTXZCvo8:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Sr9njk3xaf4:qwUWTXZCvo8:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/Sr9njk3xaf4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 17 Aug 2020 15:37:18 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GettyImages-1197009920.jpg?w=600","linkMd5":"8b39bd8d847194cdb74ff37e05a1a3dc","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn76@2020_2/2020/08/17/16-35-06-297_5494f8640fc2556d.webp","author":"Brian Heater","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn62@2020_2/2020/08/17/16-35-05-249_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn87@2020_5/2020/08/17/16-35-06-283_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn24@2020_1/2020/08/17/16-35-06-276_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=Sr9njk3xaf4:qwUWTXZCvo8:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx20/cdn3@2020_1/2020/08/17/16-35-06-321_6a44e82d2418a95a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=Sr9njk3xaf4:qwUWTXZCvo8:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn4@2020_3/2020/08/17/16-35-06-322_9df3cb681157c3d3.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx17/cdn99@2020_2/2020/08/17/16-35-38-712_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/Sr9njk3xaf4":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn92@2020_2/2020/08/17/16-35-06-284_100b1900fd58e6ca.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-18 00:35:03","updatedTime":"2020-08-18 00:35:03","title":"Founders can raise funding before launching a product","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2031457","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">It’s possible to raise VC funding even if you haven’t built a real product, according to <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/person/charles-hudson\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"charles-hudson\">Charles Hudson, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> founder and managing partner at seed-stage firm <a href=\"https://precursorvc.com\">Precursor Ventures</a>.

And so whatever it is that you&#8217;re doing, if it&#8217;s not unique, if it&#8217;s a really obvious insight, you&#8217;ll probably have 10 or 12 competitors that are launched in the market by the time you get your product out.<div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=czEXeHERzq8:hpehvB-9QLU:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=czEXeHERzq8:hpehvB-9QLU:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=czEXeHERzq8:hpehvB-9QLU:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=czEXeHERzq8:hpehvB-9QLU:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=czEXeHERzq8:hpehvB-9QLU:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=czEXeHERzq8:hpehvB-9QLU:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=czEXeHERzq8:hpehvB-9QLU:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=czEXeHERzq8:hpehvB-9QLU:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/czEXeHERzq8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 17 Aug 2020 15:55:33 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/charles-hudson-147a2921.jpg?w=600","linkMd5":"8987a65a2aada4b8788c661917155801","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn74@2020_1/2020/08/17/16-35-08-412_f882e83ac2612c25.webp","author":"Anthony Ha","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn62@2020_2/2020/08/17/16-35-05-249_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn87@2020_5/2020/08/17/16-35-06-283_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn24@2020_1/2020/08/17/16-35-06-276_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=czEXeHERzq8:hpehvB-9QLU:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn86@2020_1/2020/08/17/16-35-06-281_636af58414380b6b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=czEXeHERzq8:hpehvB-9QLU:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx17/cdn19@2020_3/2020/08/17/16-35-06-317_50b5b21b469dfd66.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx17/cdn99@2020_2/2020/08/17/16-35-38-712_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/czEXeHERzq8":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn7@2020_4/2020/08/17/16-35-06-262_4ca8b8bf53afc9e4.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-18 00:35:03","updatedTime":"2020-08-18 00:35:03","title":"Hear how to scale to $100M ARR at Disrupt 2020","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2024208","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">At <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/events/disrupt-sf-2020/?utm_medium=editpost&#38;utm_campaign=disruptsf2020&#38;utm_content=100marr&#38;utm_source=tc&#38;promo=100marr&#38;display=TRUE\">Disrupt this year</a> TechCrunch is digging into the $100 million annual recurring revenue (ARR) threshold.

These include $1 million ARR, a key moment for startups looking to raise their first Series-define round of capital, the $10 million ARR mark, at which point the same companies become hard to kill, and $100 million ARR, at which point startups can start to prep for a public offering, or regular, large capital raises from private investors.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>It&#8217;s that last milestone that we want to explore. With three executives from companies that we&#8217;ve included in our series on $100 million ARR companies, we&#8217;ll dig into what they had to learn the hard way as they grew to material business scale, what went well, and what they might be able to share to startups that aspire to a similar level of success.</p>\n<p>That we&#8217;ll be hosting the conversation during a mini-IPO wave will make it all the more exciting; these three business leaders will certainly have at least one eye on the public markets. And as we&#8217;ll have the chat in the shadow of COVID-19, we&#8217;ll learn about how the highly-valued private companies have had to adapt to a changed economic environment, and working setup.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll lean into lessons, learnings, and other operational questions with the CEO of Egnyte, an enterprise content and management service provider, the CEO of GitLab, a devops company that has long had a distributed-employee model that is incredibly pertinent to the current moment, and president of Kaltura, a software company that powers online video for other companies.</p>\n<p>Since TechCrunch started <a href=\"https://search.techcrunch.com/search;_ylc=X3IDMgRncHJpZANVUTFLMWYzbVF3aXVkRHBEYXowV1NBBG5fc3VnZwMwBHBvcwMwBHBxc3RyAwRwcXN0cmwDMARxc3RybAMyMQRxdWVyeQMlMjQxMDAlMjBtaWxsaW9uJTIwQVJSJTIwY2x1YgR0X3N0bXADMTU5NjA1ODAwOA--?p=%24100+million+ARR+club&#38;fr=techcrunch\">compiling a list</a> of companies that had either reached $100 million ARR, or were on their way, we&#8217;ve collected dozens of firms to the list.

Now investors are clamoring to bet on promising players in the field.</p>\n<p>That includes <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/digital-sky-technologies-fo\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"digital-sky-technologies-fo\">DST Global, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> the investment firm helmed by Israeli-Russian billionaire Yuri Milner. Most recently, it poured $35 million into Weee!, a California-based startup that delivers Asian groceries like fresh kimchi and Japanese desserts from its own warehouses to major cities across the U.S. The funding boosted the five-year-old startup&#8217;s total raise since launch to over $100 million.</p>\n<p>Weee! declined to share its post-money valuation, but the figure likely surpasses $500 million given it&#8217;s widely known that DST Global does not generally back companies whose valuation is under $500 million.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>Online grocery is a capital-intensive business with thin profit margins, so it&#8217;s unsurprising to see many contenders &#8212; in both China and the U.S. &#8212; operating in the red. Against the odds, Weee! turned profitable earlier this year and went cash-flow positive.</p>\n<p>That means the startup was in no rush to fundraise, probably giving it more bargaining power in negotiating terms with a storied investor like DST Global, whose portfolio spans Spotify, Twitter, Airbnb, Slack, Didi, Gojek, just to name a few.</p>\n<p>Weee! certainly matches DST Global&#8217;s investment target as a high-growth startup. In June, the company recorded 700% year-over-year growth in revenue and was on course to generate revenue in the lower hundreds of millions of dollars in 2020, it <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/05/weee-profile/\">told TechCrunch at the time.</a></p>\n<p>Since the U.S. begins winding down lockdowns and people return to supermarkets, some grocery delivery services have seen their revenue growth slow. Weee!, however, is currently growing 15-20% more than its March peak. Liu explained the sustained boom stems from the service&#8217;s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/05/weee-profile/\">product differentiation</a>: Asian specialties that one can&#8217;t even find in Chinatowns.</p>\n<p>&#8220;People don&#8217;t want to pay extra if [an online grocery] only provides convenient delivery but no product differentiation,&#8221; said Han Shen, founding partner of <a href=\"https://ifly.vc/\">iFly.vc</a>, a California-based fund that backed Weee! in its Series A round.</p>\n<p>In addition, Weee! tries to streamline every step of its operations, from product procurement, warehouse management, staff allocation, through to door-to-door delivery. The result is zero food waste thanks to fast inventory turnover.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There is no secret tactic that we can&#8217;t talk about, nothing more than achieving efficiency throughout the entire process,&#8221; Shen observed.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, Weee! works to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/28/transferwise-five-unicorns/\">keep prices down</a> by cultivating direct relationships with suppliers like local farms and opting for next-day delivery rather than the more costly 30-minute standard expected in China, where he grew up. Earlier this year, former chief operations officer of Netflix Tom Dillon joined the board to help beef up Weee!&#8217;s operational efficiency.</p>\n<p>With the new proceeds, the Asian e-grocer hopes to hire new talents and expand its delivery service from eight key regions to 13-14 cities across the U.S. by the end of this year.</p>\n<p><audio style=\"display: none;\" controls=\"controls\"></audio></p>\n<p><audio style=\"display: none;\" controls=\"controls\"></audio></p>\n<p><audio style=\"display: none;\" controls=\"controls\"></audio></p>\n<p><audio style=\"display: none;\" controls=\"controls\"></audio></p>\n<p><audio style=\"display: none;\" controls=\"controls\"></audio></p>\n<p><audio style=\"display: none;\" controls=\"controls\"></audio></p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=PqeT_Xfog08:22weT_OgCVw:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=PqeT_Xfog08:22weT_OgCVw:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=PqeT_Xfog08:22weT_OgCVw:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=PqeT_Xfog08:22weT_OgCVw:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=PqeT_Xfog08:22weT_OgCVw:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=PqeT_Xfog08:22weT_OgCVw:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=PqeT_Xfog08:22weT_OgCVw:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=PqeT_Xfog08:22weT_OgCVw:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/PqeT_Xfog08\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 17 Aug 2020 15:07:28 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/weee-5.jpg?w=600","linkMd5":"2df584938efa19333896ea71d9211049","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn77@2020_5/2020/08/17/16-35-06-325_6efed39b52126002.webp","author":"Rita Liao","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn62@2020_2/2020/08/17/16-35-05-249_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn87@2020_5/2020/08/17/16-35-06-283_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn24@2020_1/2020/08/17/16-35-06-276_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=PqeT_Xfog08:22weT_OgCVw:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn80@2020_3/2020/08/17/16-35-06-543_72cc32b1835c465f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=PqeT_Xfog08:22weT_OgCVw:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn44@2020_5/2020/08/17/16-35-06-323_820c23bfdf0cbc13.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx17/cdn99@2020_2/2020/08/17/16-35-38-712_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/PqeT_Xfog08":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn35@2020_2/2020/08/17/16-35-06-398_ebd2d6d5781eab05.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-18 00:35:03","updatedTime":"2020-08-18 00:35:03","title":"Lucid Motors CEO and CTO Peter Rawlinson to join TC Sessions: Mobility 2020","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2030460","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lucid Motors will unveil its long anticipated all-electric luxury electric Air sedan on September 9, a vehicle that promises to have at least 517 miles on a single charge.

Too big for their own good, or too big to be good, here&#8217;s what&#8217;s up with the incumbents:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Germany is <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-germany-competition/german-watchdog-launches-amazon-investigation-report-idUSKCN25C0LW\">taking on Amazon</a> at the very same time that <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/14/amazon-faces-antitrust-probe-in-canada.html\">Canada is taking on Amazon</a>, meaning that the Seattle giant is taking shots from two key markets at the same time.</li>\n<li>Google is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/aug/17/google-open-letter-australia-news-media-bargaining-code-free-services-risk-contains-misinformation-accc-says\">having a war of words with Australia</a>, after a ruling in the country didn&#8217;t go its way.</li>\n<li>Walled gardens are <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/15/21369607/apple-ios-fortnite-ban-epic-lawsuit-cloud-gaming-xcloud-microsoft-antitrust-war?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4\">seeing their walls come under heavy fire</a>, which means that Apple and Google are fighting both sides of their marketplaces (producers, consumers) at once at the moment, which isn&#8217;t great.</li>\n<li>And Microsoft might buy TikTok.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All told it seems that the biggest tech companies are busy defending their market position instead of re-earning it with great products. A good time for startups? I think so. When incumbents are busy fighting with governments, themselves, and each other, it&#8217;s a great time to show up, steal a march, and build neat products that take away their momentum.</p>\n<p>On the funding front, we peeked at <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/14/birmingham-based-help-lightning-raises-8-million-for-its-remote-training-and-support-tools/\">the neat Help Lightning round</a>, <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/2020/08/17/agiloft-raises-45-million-to-automate-contract-procurement-and-management/\">the Agiloft investment</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2020/08/13/578970.htm\">the Vertafore exit</a>.</p>\n<p>And then there was <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/asana-weeks-away-from-a-listing-projects-annual-revenue-growth-of-66\">this report concerning Asana</a>, which is growing nicely for a company of its size and could actually be cheap at its current price? Anyway, we want the company to get on with getting public so that we can read its S-1 filing.

Many retailers don&#8217;t want to put their cloud presence onto AWS, as Amazon.com competes directly with these retailers. Brent Leary, founder and principal analyst at CRM Essentials, says that as such, the news doesn&#8217;t really surprise him.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Retailers have to compete with Amazon, and I&#8217;m guessing the last thing they want to do is use AWS and help Amazon fund all their new initiatives and experiments that in some cases will be used against them,&#8221; Leary told TechCrunch. Further, he said that many retailers would also prefer to keep their customer data off of Amazon&#8217;s services.</p>\n<p>Canalys Senior Director Alex Smith says that this Amazon effect combined with the pandemic and other technological factors has been working in Google&#8217;s favor, at least in the retail sector. &#8220;Now more than ever, retailers need a digital strategy to win in an omnichannel world, especially with Amazon’s online dominance. Digital is applied everywhere from customer experience to cost optimization, and the overall technological capability of a retailer is what will define its success,” he said.</p>\n<p>COVID-19 has forced many retailers to close stores for extended periods of time, and when you combine that with people being more reluctant to go inside stores when they do open, retailers have had to take a crash course in eCommerce if they didn&#8217;t have a significant online presence already.</p>\n<p>Canalys points out that Google has lured customers with its advertising and search capabilities beyond just pure infrastructure offerings, taking advantage of its other strengths to grow the market segment.</p>\n<p>Recognizing this, Google has been making a big retail push including a big partnership with Salesforce and specific products announced at Google Cloud Next last year. As we wrote <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/10/google-cloud-takes-aim-at-verticals-starting-with-new-set-of-tools-for-retailers/\">at the time</a> of the retail offering,</p>\n<blockquote><p>The company offers eCommerce Hosting, designed specifically for online retailers, and it is offering a special premium program, so retailers get “white glove treatment with technical architecture reviews and peak season operations support…” according to the company. In other words, it wants to help these companies avoid disastrous, money-losing results when a site goes down due to demand.</p></blockquote>\n<p>What&#8217;s more, Canalys reports that Google Cloud has also been hiring aggressively and forming partnerships with big systems integrators to help grow the retail business. Retail customers include Home Depot, Kohl&#8217;s, Costco and Best Buy.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"kBsPwJQyos\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/31/even-as-cloud-infrastructure-growth-slows-revenue-rises-over-30b-for-quarter/\">Even as cloud infrastructure growth slows, revenue rises over $30B for quarter</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Even as cloud infrastructure growth slows, revenue rises over $30B for quarter&#8221;
