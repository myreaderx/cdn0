When I was young, the first <strong>Monster M900</strong> (1994) spoke to me. A basic, naked, standard <a href=\"http://www.motorcycle.com/manufacturer/ducati.html\"><strong>Ducati</strong></a> that was perfect for rumbling round the urban maze back when we all had a downtown office to go to&#8230; a svelte Italian Sportster that bounced its mating call off the concrete canyons all the way to 9000 rpm. It really was a radical departure since, before then, Ducati had only built fully-faired assume-the-position sportbikes, and not many of them. They were great on the Futa Pass and Angeles Crest but not so much anywhere else. Later, when we grew power-hungry in the ’oughts, there came the 996-powered S4R, then the Monster 1200s…</p>\n<p>I’m pretty sure I’m no longer the target audience, but 27 years down the road, I can’t help thinking Ducati’s keeping an eye on me and every inch of girth I gain, with every new Monster they design: The ergonomics and user interface of this latest one are the kindest, least monstrous ever. They’ve stuffed more of some exclusive foam into the seat, narrowed the bike between the knees. They’ve pulled the handlebar 2.6 inches rearward, and moved the footpegs 0.4 in. lower and 1.4 in. rearward compared to the previous Monster 821. It always was, but now, the Monster’s an even easier bike to just hop on and go, and feel immediately comfortable.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_150477\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" style=\"width: 633px\"><a href=\"https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-gn0mdnwe.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-150477\" src=\"https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-gn0mdnwe-633x487.jpg\" alt=\"2021 Ducati Monster Review - Jake Zemke wheelie\" width=\"633\" height=\"487\" srcset=\"https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-gn0mdnwe-633x487.jpg 633w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-gn0mdnwe-315x242.jpg 315w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-gn0mdnwe-768x591.jpg 768w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-gn0mdnwe-60x46.jpg 60w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-gn0mdnwe-117x90.jpg 117w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-gn0mdnwe-121x93.jpg 121w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-gn0mdnwe-186x143.jpg 186w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-gn0mdnwe-166x128.jpg 166w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-gn0mdnwe-178x137.jpg 178w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-gn0mdnwe-214x165.jpg 214w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-gn0mdnwe-325x250.jpg 325w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-gn0mdnwe-504x388.jpg 504w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-gn0mdnwe-547x421.jpg 547w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 633px) 100vw, 633px\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jake Zemke is more the target audience than me, though the former AMA Formula Xtreme champ is sprouting three or four gray hairs himself.</p></div>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><a href=\"https://www.motorcycle.com/manufacturer/ducati/2018-ducati-monster-821-first-ride-review.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2018 Ducati Monster 821 Review – First Ride</a></strong></p>\n<h2 style=\"padding-top: 0px;\">You Look Different?</h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_150505\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" style=\"width: 633px\"><a href=\"https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-tmen7rgq.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-150505\" src=\"https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-tmen7rgq-633x422.jpg\" alt=\"2021 Ducati Monster Review\" width=\"633\" height=\"422\" srcset=\"https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-tmen7rgq-633x422.jpg 633w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-tmen7rgq-315x210.jpg 315w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-tmen7rgq-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-tmen7rgq-69x46.jpg 69w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-tmen7rgq-120x80.jpg 120w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-tmen7rgq-140x93.jpg 140w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-tmen7rgq-186x124.jpg 186w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-tmen7rgq-192x128.jpg 192w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-tmen7rgq-206x137.jpg 206w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-tmen7rgq-248x165.jpg 248w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-tmen7rgq-375x250.jpg 375w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-tmen7rgq-582x388.jpg 582w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-tmen7rgq-632x421.jpg 632w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 633px) 100vw, 633px\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Waif-like. Anorexic almost.</p></div>\n<p>Mostly it’s what they’ve taken away from the new Monster that makes it nicer to ride than ever: 40 pounds. Love it or hate it, the new aluminum monocoque “frame” and GFRP (Glass Fiber Reinforced Polymer) subframe lop off around 15 pounds. The new swingarm gets rid of another 3.5 pounds, the wheels are said to be lighter by nearly 4 pounds total, and the new Testastretta 11° V-twin takes off another 5 lbs. Suddenly you’re at 366 lbs dry, says Ducati, and 414 ready to ride. That’s 8 pounds more than the <strong><a href=\"https://www.motorcycle.com/manufacturer/yamaha/2021-yamaha-mt-07-review.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Yamaha MT-07</a></strong> Troy just rode, and 3 pounds less than the new MT-09. It’s also right in there with <strong><a href=\"http://www.motorcycle.com/manufacturer/ktm.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">KTM</a> Duke 890</strong> and <strong><a href=\"http://www.motorcycle.com/manufacturer/triumph.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Triumph</a> Street Triple</strong> – all motorcycles defined by their lightweight athleticism.</p>\n<h2 style=\"padding-top: 0px;\">Urban Grind</h2>\n<p>For getting around the city, the Monster is right there with the best of them. Getting rid of the steel frame freed up a lot of room in the headstock area, which gives the new bike 7 degrees more steering sweep in both directions. That makes it possible to turn around in the tightest alleys, and slalom quickly through the dumpsters. (Show some respect; people are trying to sleep in many of them in San Francisco, where we went to ride the new bike. I kid, people are only trying to sleep in a few dumpsters. Most of San Francisco is a beautiful place.)</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_150495\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" style=\"width: 633px\"><a href=\"https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-stripped-down.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-150495\" src=\"https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-stripped-down-633x356.jpg\" alt=\"2021 Ducati Monster Review\" width=\"633\" height=\"356\" srcset=\"https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-stripped-down-633x356.jpg 633w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-stripped-down-315x177.jpg 315w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-stripped-down-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-stripped-down-75x42.jpg 75w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-stripped-down-120x68.jpg 120w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-stripped-down-150x84.jpg 150w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-stripped-down-186x105.jpg 186w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-stripped-down-210x118.jpg 210w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-stripped-down-224x126.jpg 224w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-stripped-down-270x152.jpg 270w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-stripped-down-408x230.jpg 408w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-stripped-down-637x358.jpg 637w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-stripped-down-800x450.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 633px) 100vw, 633px\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The new aluminum “frame” bolts to the cylinder heads and mounts the front fork. The swingarm pivots in the engine cases.</p></div>\n<p>Furthermore, the new (lack of) frame makes the Monster waif-like between the knees, which makes it easy to touch the ground and reinforces its nimbleness. In fact, Ducati really wants it to be approachable for less experienced and/or shorter riders. The standard seat is 32.3 inches, but the low option is 31.5 in. – and there’s a $300 suspension lowering kit available to take it down another inch.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-8168.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-150465\" src=\"https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-8168-633x462.jpg\" alt=\"2021 Ducati Monster Review\" width=\"633\" height=\"462\" srcset=\"https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-8168-633x462.jpg 633w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-8168-315x230.jpg 315w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-8168-768x561.jpg 768w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-8168-63x46.jpg 63w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-8168-120x88.jpg 120w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-8168-127x93.jpg 127w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-8168-186x136.jpg 186w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-8168-175x128.jpg 175w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-8168-188x137.jpg 188w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-8168-226x165.jpg 226w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-8168-342x250.jpg 342w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-8168-531x388.jpg 531w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-8168-576x421.jpg 576w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 633px) 100vw, 633px\" /></a></p>\n<p>There’s a new hydraulically actuated clutch lever at your left hand, which is way easier and smoother to engage than Monsters of yore, and the clutch itself is a slip/assist unit. Internal changes to the 6-speed gearbox make for light, precise shifts – until you remember you’ve got a standard up/down quickshifter and barely need to think about shifting. Stuck in traffic with the group (you’d never get stuck if you were by yourself on the Monster), it’s easy to snick into neutral even when you’re stopped.</p>\n<p>Since this is a semi entry-level Ducati and we’re trying to keep the price down, we’re not getting fully adjustable electronic suspension, but the inverted 43mm fork and single cantilevered shock out back, with dual-rate spring, work nicely together: 5.1 inches travel in front and 5.5 out back smooth out 88% of San Francisco’s larger lumps, trolley tracks, and chunks of construction debris. A large degree of credit goes to that cush new seat, too. The only ergonomic complaint you might lodge, if you have big feet and are whatever the opposite of pigeon-toed is, is that your heels might not like the passenger peg carriers, especially the right one that’s also the exhaust hanger.</p>\n<h2 style=\"padding-top: 0px;\">Big Honkin’ Angry Goose</h2>\n<p>To move into the Euro 5 era, Ducati replaced the previous 821 cc Testastretta 11° with the 937 cc version. In Monster trim, Ducati claims 111 hp at 9,250 rpm with torque peaking at 69 lb-ft at just 6,500 rpm. That’s 2 hp more than the 821 had.

There’s plenty of torque to get rolling right off idle, but whatever’s going on in the new airbox, at 5000 rpm or so and big throttle openings, there’s a big bump in volume and power as the Monster gets down to whatever business you point it at, including hoisting its front wheel in the air. All the latest electronic aids have trickled directly down from the Panigale, including wheelie control, and setting 1 in second gear is a good place to acquire that skill without fear of over-rotating, if you’re up for it, so to speak.</p>\n<p>For me, it all feels quite a bit torquier than the numbers indicate; the Monster’s newfound midrange reminds me a lot of the Indian FTR1200’s immediate punch. It’s not as powerful as the FTR, but the fact that the Monster’s 100 pounds lighter than the FTR makes it just as eager. You’ve got the usual ride modes, but even in the most aggressive – Sport – power delivery is perfectly acceptable and smooth, and riding up Lombard Street (you can only ride down it without a police escort) is a doddle in first gear with a little clutch here and there.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_150501\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" style=\"width: 633px\"><a href=\"https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-throttle-bodies.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-150501\" src=\"https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-throttle-bodies-633x356.jpg\" alt=\"2021 Ducati Monster Review\" width=\"633\" height=\"356\" srcset=\"https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-throttle-bodies-633x356.jpg 633w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-throttle-bodies-315x177.jpg 315w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-throttle-bodies-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-throttle-bodies-75x42.jpg 75w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-throttle-bodies-120x68.jpg 120w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-throttle-bodies-150x84.jpg 150w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-throttle-bodies-186x105.jpg 186w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-throttle-bodies-210x118.jpg 210w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-throttle-bodies-224x126.jpg 224w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-throttle-bodies-270x152.jpg 270w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-throttle-bodies-408x230.jpg 408w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-throttle-bodies-637x359.jpg 637w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-throttle-bodies-800x450.jpg 800w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-throttle-bodies.jpg 906w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 633px) 100vw, 633px\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">A pair of 53mm throttle bodies deliver the juice.

Be sure to check that the intersection is safe before proceeding.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_150499\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" style=\"width: 633px\"><a href=\"https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-tft.png\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-150499\" src=\"https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-tft-633x436.png\" alt=\"2021 Ducati Monster Review\" width=\"633\" height=\"436\" srcset=\"https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-tft-633x436.png 633w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-tft-315x217.png 315w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-tft-768x530.png 768w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-tft-67x46.png 67w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-tft-120x83.png 120w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-tft-135x93.png 135w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-tft-186x128.png 186w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-tft-199x137.png 199w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-tft-239x165.png 239w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-tft-363x250.png 363w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-tft-563x388.png 563w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-tft-611x421.png 611w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-tft.png 1462w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 633px) 100vw, 633px\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">On the 4.3-inch TFT display, it’s easy to go in and dial everything up or down as desired. That’s a good thing, since the Monster inspires more risky behavior than most. Putting the gear position indicator right inside the tach was smart. Your Bluetooth module is available as an accessory.</p></div>\n<p>The TFT is nicely colorful, packed with information that’s probably easy to find after you’ve ridden the bike a while, and switches from day to night automatically. Now we’ve got full LED lighting including turn signals (well, they’re still awaiting US certification), and a daytime running light that lends a kind of beatific aspect to the Monster.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-psqwndoa.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-150489\" src=\"https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-psqwndoa-633x422.jpg\" alt=\"2021 Ducati Monster Review\" width=\"633\" height=\"422\" srcset=\"https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-psqwndoa-633x422.jpg 633w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-psqwndoa-315x210.jpg 315w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-psqwndoa-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-psqwndoa-69x46.jpg 69w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-psqwndoa-120x80.jpg 120w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-psqwndoa-140x93.jpg 140w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-psqwndoa-186x124.jpg 186w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-psqwndoa-192x128.jpg 192w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-psqwndoa-206x137.jpg 206w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-psqwndoa-248x165.jpg 248w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-psqwndoa-375x250.jpg 375w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-psqwndoa-582x388.jpg 582w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-psqwndoa-632x421.jpg 632w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 633px) 100vw, 633px\" /></a></p>\n<h2 style=\"padding-top: 0px;\">Anyway&#8230;</h2>\n<p>If you’re one of those people who’s bent out of shape because the pretty trellis frame is gone, you might as well just get over it. As Ducati points out, the original Monster recipe was the previous-generation engine in the superbike frame. Which is exactly the recipe for this one. Also, they’ve sold over 350,000 Monsters to date, so if you don’t like this one there are literally tons of pre-owned Monsters of every stripe looking for a good home.</p>\n<h2 style=\"padding-top: 0px;\">Bottom Line</h2>\n<p>How much would you expect to pay? $11,895 in Monster Red seems about right, and $200 more for Aviator Gray or Dark Stealth. Monster + adds a fly screen that’s more a fig leaf, and a passenger seat cover, for $200 more – that’s $12,095 in red. Not bad for a Ducati. Not great for the class: Riding home, I lane-splat for a while with a guy on a brand-new <strong><a href=\"http://www.motorcycle.com/manufacturer/yamaha.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Yamaha</a> MT-09 SP</strong>, which comes with premium suspension and cruise control, for $11k.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_150497\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" style=\"width: 610px\"><a href=\"https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-termignoni-exhaust.png\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-150497\" src=\"https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-termignoni-exhaust-610x633.png\" alt=\"2021 Ducati Monster Review\" width=\"610\" height=\"633\" srcset=\"https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-termignoni-exhaust-610x633.png 610w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-termignoni-exhaust-304x315.png 304w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-termignoni-exhaust-768x797.png 768w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-termignoni-exhaust-44x46.png 44w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-termignoni-exhaust-87x90.png 87w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-termignoni-exhaust-90x93.png 90w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-termignoni-exhaust-179x186.png 179w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-termignoni-exhaust-123x128.png 123w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-termignoni-exhaust-132x137.png 132w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-termignoni-exhaust-159x165.png 159w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-termignoni-exhaust-241x250.png 241w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-termignoni-exhaust-374x388.png 374w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-termignoni-exhaust-406x421.png 406w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050721-2021-ducati-monster-review-termignoni-exhaust.png 846w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Massimo Bordi’s original idea for the Monster was to build a bike as modifiable as a Harley, and that hasn’t changed. You may need these Termignoni cans, and Ducati is also offering a bunch of other accessories, graphics packages, sticker kits and things. Also to appeal to the sticker generation: a Ducati Premier Financing deal with $109 payments for 48 months (with a final $6,755 payment due at the end when you read the smaller print). Can you just give it back after four years?</p></div>\n<p>But then, the dark side of Japan may not be your bag if you’re lusting after a Ducati. It’s true, the bolides from Bologna, the Italian stallions, whatever you call them – do have a certain swagger, and do get you membership in the Ducati club. Wikipedia informs us that on September 21, 2008, “a gathering of Ducati Monsters in Hamme-Moerzeke, Belgium, broke the Guinness Record for the ’largest parade of motorcycles of the same brand and type.’ 405 Ducati Monsters were tallied.”</p>\n<p>Wait, has no one in Belgium been to Sturgis or Daytona?</p>\n<p>That’s beside the point. The point is, welcome to the new Monster, same as the old Monster. But more sophisticated, comfortable, lighter, lither, and more “fun to ride” than ever.</p>\n<p><a
