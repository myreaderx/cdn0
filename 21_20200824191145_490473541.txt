The DC Comics movie continues the adventures of a few characters from 2016&#8217;s <em>Suicide Squad</em>, but thanks to the <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> director stepping behind the camera, the movie has a completely new style and it seems to have a much more vibrant look that draws from the colorful side of DC Comics. Along with that, <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-suicide-squad-introduces-the-full-roster-of-bad-guys-james-gunn-is-bringing-to-theaters-dc-fandome/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">there&#8217;s a huge new roster of characters</a>, many of them from the more obscure pages of <strong>John Ostrander</strong>&#8216;s run on the comic book series. Since people probably don&#8217;t know a lot about them, here are <em>The Suicide Squad</em> characters explained.<span id=\"more-633139\"></span></p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-633141 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-rollcall-violadavis-700x320.jpg\" alt=\"James Gunn's The Suicide Squad - Viola Davis\" width=\"700\" height=\"320\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-rollcall-violadavis-700x320.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-rollcall-violadavis-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-rollcall-violadavis-768x351.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-rollcall-violadavis.jpg 1075w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<h2>Viola Davis is Amanda Waller</h2>\n<p>Amanda Waller is responsible for the creation of the Suicide Squad, under the code name of Task Force X. Waller thought she could manipulate some bad guys into doing some good. The team&#8217;s first foray didn&#8217;t exactly go very well, and in an act of desperation, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljBx-fw7UMQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">she sought the protection of Bruce Wayne</a>, seemingly knowing that he as Batman. Her protection came at the price of some information on a couple of certain super-powered individuals: Barry Allen and Arthur Curry, aka The Flash and Aquaman. But this didn&#8217;t make Waller a buddy of Batman&#8217;s. After their agreement, Wayne told Waller she should shut down Task Force X, or else he and his friends would do it for her.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-633142 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-rollcall-joelkinnaman-700x339.jpg\" alt=\"James Gunn's The Suicide Squad - Joel Kinnaman\" width=\"700\" height=\"339\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-rollcall-joelkinnaman-700x339.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-rollcall-joelkinnaman-360x174.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-rollcall-joelkinnaman-768x371.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-rollcall-joelkinnaman.jpg 1073w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<h2>Joel Kinnaman is Rick Flag</h2>\n<p>Rick Flag is Amanda Waller&#8217;s right-hand man. He&#8217;s a colonel who was hired to keep an eye on June Moone, the woman who becomes possessed by the ancient goddess Enchantress. Flag fell in love with June, which Waller used to her advantage in the first movie, giving him no choice but to go with the Suicide Squad into Midway City and keep them on mission. Though Enchantress used June&#8217;s body to carry out her plan (which is a bad one), she ended up surviving their final confrontation, and Flag and an unpossessed June were reunited. However, it would seem that June maybe isn&#8217;t around anymore in <em>The Suicide Squad</em>.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-633145 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-rollcall-margotrobbie-700x326.jpg\" alt=\"James Gunn's The Suicide Squad - Margot Robbie\" width=\"700\" height=\"326\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-rollcall-margotrobbie-700x326.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-rollcall-margotrobbie-360x168.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-rollcall-margotrobbie-768x358.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-rollcall-margotrobbie.jpg 1075w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<h2>Margot Robbie is Harley Quinn</h2>\n<p>Harley Quinn has been through the wringer, especially after the events of<em> Birds of Prey</em>. Now that she&#8217;s free from The Joker&#8217;s control, she can do whatever the hell she wants with whoever the hell she wants. We&#8217;re not exactly sure what her motivation is for teaming up with the Suicide Squad again, but clearly she&#8217;s having a good time, and she has plenty of new weapons at her disposal.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-633156 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-rollcall-jaicourtney-700x324.jpg\" alt=\"James Gunn's The Suicide Squad - Jai Courtney\" width=\"700\" height=\"324\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-rollcall-jaicourtney-700x324.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-rollcall-jaicourtney-360x166.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-rollcall-jaicourtney-768x355.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-rollcall-jaicourtney.jpg 1066w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<h2>Jai Courtney is Captain Boomerang</h2>\n<p>Captain Boomerang, or George &#8220;Digger&#8221; Harkness, probably doesn&#8217;t have anything better to do than work with Suicide Squad again. At the end of the first movie, he was the only one who was extremely visibly angry about being taken back to prison. Not even his love for pink unicorns could bring him any calm, and the last time we saw him, he was screaming in his prison cell as the guard closed the window to his cell door on him.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-633148 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-rollcall-idriselba-700x309.jpg\" alt=\"James Gunn's The Suicide Squad - Idris Elba\" width=\"700\" height=\"309\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-rollcall-idriselba-700x309.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-rollcall-idriselba-360x159.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-rollcall-idriselba-768x339.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-rollcall-idriselba.jpg 1069w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<h2>Idris Elba is Bloodsport</h2>\n<p>During the DC FanDome panel for <em>The Suicide Squad</em>, it was revealed that Bloodsport has been imprisoned for trying to shoot Superman with a Kryptonite bullet. That rings true with the character&#8217;s DC Comics history. Since his inception in 1987, Bloodsport (aka Robert DuBois) has famously used Kryptonite bullets an an effort take down Superman. In his first appearance, he was recruited by one of Lex Luthor&#8217;s agents and was convinced Superman was an enemy to be dealt with.</p>\n<p>Much of Bloodsport&#8217;s driving force for violence in the comics comes from his anger over the Vietnam War. That&#8217;s because he was too scared to be a soldier, and his brother Michael (&#8220;Micky&#8221;), stepped up to go in his place, which resulted in him becoming a quadruple amputee. We&#8217;re not sure if that part of Bloodsport&#8217;s origin will be referenced here.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-633146 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-rollcall-daviddastmalchian-700x334.jpg\" alt=\"James Gunn's The Suicide Squad - David Dastmalchian\" width=\"700\" height=\"334\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-rollcall-daviddastmalchian-700x334.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-rollcall-daviddastmalchian-360x172.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-rollcall-daviddastmalchian-768x367.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-rollcall-daviddastmalchian.jpg 1074w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<h2>David Dastmalchian is Polka Dot Man</h2>\n<p>Known as Mr. Polka-Dot in the comics, his real name is Abner Krill, and he&#8217;s responsible for creating a polka-dot covered suit where the dots can be removed from the costume and turned into a variety of useful weapons and items – not to mention a getaway vehicle that looks a lot like a flying saucer. In the comics, Polka Dot Man once captured Robin, though was inevitably defeated by Batman. Will that be part of his big screen history, too?</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-633157 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-rollcall-johncena-700x322.jpg\" alt=\"James Gunn's The Suicide Squad - John Cena\" width=\"700\" height=\"322\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-rollcall-johncena-700x322.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-rollcall-johncena-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-rollcall-johncena-768x353.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-rollcall-johncena.jpg 1071w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<h2>John Cena is Peacemaker</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-suicide-squad-featurette/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">In the featurette</a> revealed during DC FanDome, John Cena referred to Peacemaker as &#8220;a douchey Captain America.&#8221; Gunn added that the character believes in peace at any cost, no matter how many people he has to kill in order to achieve it. Peacemaker is usually depicted as a good guy in the comics, and he doesn&#8217;t appear to have a history with the Suicide Squad. But it&#8217;s been said that he&#8217;s the newest member of the team in the movie, so maybe it will be a short-lived affair.</p>\n<p>In the comics, Peacemaker used to be a peaceful diplomat known as Christopher Smith. The violence he began to rely on for peace was a result of a serious mental illness brought on by the shame of having a Nazi death camp commandant for a father. As his vigilante streak continued, he came to believe that the ghosts of the people he killed were collected inside his helmet, offering him advice and commentary. Oh, how I hope James Gunn uses that detail in the movie.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-633143 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-rollcall-michaelrooker-700x323.jpg\" alt=\"James Gunn's The Suicide Squad - Michael Rooker\" width=\"700\" height=\"323\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-rollcall-michaelrooker-700x323.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-rollcall-michaelrooker-360x166.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-rollcall-michaelrooker-768x354.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-rollcall-michaelrooker.jpg 1072w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<h2>Michael Rooker is Savant</h2>\n<p>Savant, aka Brian Durlin, is the spoiled her to an enormous fortune, which he hoped to use to become a vigilante in Gotham City like Batman. But Batman discouraged his heroics because Savant didn&#8217;t seem to care much about protecting others. So instead, he used his genius computer skills to create a blackmailing business, which became quite successful. Savant is also great at hand-to-hand combat, but due to a chemical imbalance, he&#8217;s hindered by a terrible short-term memory. Surely that&#8217;s something James Gunn will have some fun with in the movie.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-633144 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-rollcall-flulaborg-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"James Gunn's The Suicide Squad - Flula Borg\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-rollcall-flulaborg-700x300.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-rollcall-flulaborg-360x154.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-rollcall-flulaborg-768x329.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-rollcall-flulaborg.jpg 1075w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<h2>Flula Borg is Javelin</h2>\n<p>A former Olympic athlete turned criminal, Javelin is known for using weapons inspired by the very spears he would throw in competition. After a battle with Green Lantern, in which he surprisingly got the upper-hand before inevitably being captured, he agrees to join Suicide Squad in order to be acquitted of his crimes. That&#8217;s his comic book origin, but with such an obscure character, there are bound to be some changes. In fact, since a lot of this iteration of the team is probably going to die, we might not even learn that much about him.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-633147 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-rollcall-danielamelchior-700x307.jpg\" alt=\"James Gunn's The Suicide Squad - Daniela Melchior\" width=\"700\" height=\"307\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-rollcall-danielamelchior-700x307.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-rollcall-danielamelchior-360x158.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-rollcall-danielamelchior-768x336.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-rollcall-danielamelchior.jpg 1071w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<h2>Daniela Melchior is Ratcatcher 2</h2>\n<p>Ratcatcher, a former exterminator turned criminal, has the special ability to communicate with and train rats to do his bidding. Since he&#8217;s so tight with rats in Gotham City, he&#8217;s also very knowledgeable about Gotham&#8217;s sewer system, making it easy for him to smuggle items in an out of prison. He also has a gas gun. However, Daniel Melchior is playing a character called Ratcatcher 2, so either this is a protégé who has taken on the mantle, or maybe she&#8217;s the original Ratcatcher&#8217;s daughter. We may have to ask the rats.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-633151 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-rollcall-petercapaldi-700x323.jpg\" alt=\"James Gunn's The Suicide Squad - Peter Capaldi\" width=\"700\" height=\"323\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-rollcall-petercapaldi-700x323.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-rollcall-petercapaldi-360x166.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-rollcall-petercapaldi-768x354.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-rollcall-petercapaldi.jpg 1070w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<h2>Peter Capaldi is Thinker</h2>\n<p>One of the original members of the Injustice Society of America, Thinker has a genius-level intellect, and when combined with a special thinking cap, he has perception that borders on clairvoyance. In the comics, he accepted a mission with Suicide Squad in exchange for a full pardon of his various crimes, but he ended up being seemingly killed by fellow team member Weasel. In actuality, he merely returned to his hometown of Keystone City to live out the rest of his life. That part with Weasel might be of interest, but we&#8217;ll get to that later.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-633150 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-rollcall-maylingng-700x333.jpg\" alt=\"James Gunn's The Suicide Squad - Mayling Ng\" width=\"700\" height=\"333\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-rollcall-maylingng-700x333.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-rollcall-maylingng-360x171.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-rollcall-maylingng-768x365.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-rollcall-maylingng.jpg 1074w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<h2>Mayling Ng is Mongal</h2>\n<p>As the daughter of an alien space conqueror named Mongul the Elder, Mongal has many superhuman abilities. She and her twin brother Mongul the Younger also once battled Superman together and lived to tell the tale. However, she did almost have her throat ripped out by Krypto, the Superdog. Perhaps that could result in a few playful jabs from the rest of the Suicide Squad, if that&#8217;s something they include in the movie.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-633153 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-rollcall-petedavidson-700x309.jpg\" alt=\"James Gunn's The Suicide Squad -Pete Davidson\" width=\"700\" height=\"309\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-rollcall-petedavidson-700x309.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-rollcall-petedavidson-360x159.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-rollcall-petedavidson-768x339.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-rollcall-petedavidson.jpg 1044w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<h2>Pete Davidson is Blackguard</h2>\n<p>In the comics, Blackguard isn&#8217;t exactly the best villain. Originally recruited by the criminal organization known as The 1,000, Blackguard got his ass kicked by Booster Gold and was kicked out of the group. Beyond that, there are not a lot of details about the character other than the fact that his armor allows him to generate a mace and shield out of pure energy. However, in the brief footage we&#8217;ve seen of the character, it appears he&#8217;s opted to use regular ol&#8217; guns. Maybe he only uses the energy weapons when he really needs them. Either way, I don&#8217;t see him lasting very long.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-633152 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-rollcall-alicebraga-700x332.jpg\" alt=\"James Gunn's The Suicide Squad - Alice Braga\" width=\"700\" height=\"332\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-rollcall-alicebraga-700x332.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-rollcall-alicebraga-360x171.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-rollcall-alicebraga-768x365.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-rollcall-alicebraga.jpg 1074w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<h2>Alice Braga is Solsoria</h2>\n<p>Solsoria isn&#8217;t a character found in the<em> Suicide Squad</em> comics. That makes us wonder if Alice Braga might be playing a gender-swapped version of Juan Soria, who actually <em>is</em> a member of Suicide Squad. After injuring his hand, Juan Soria injected nanites into his body giving him the ability to place his hand against any locked object and make it automatically unlock. He used this superpower to audition for Justice League, but was denied. So of course, he turned to a life of crime. There&#8217;s also always the chance that Braga is playing Juan Soria&#8217;s daughter, and maybe she&#8217;s pissed about something having to do with her father.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-633154 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-rollcall-tdk-700x319.jpg\" alt=\"James Gunn's The Suicide Squad - Nathan Fillion\" width=\"700\" height=\"319\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-rollcall-tdk-700x319.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-rollcall-tdk-360x164.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-rollcall-tdk-768x350.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-rollcall-tdk.jpg 1066w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<h2>Nathan Fillion is TDK</h2>\n<p>There&#8217;s no character by the name of TDK in DC Comics. However, if you <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-suicide-squad-poster-logos/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">look at the logo created</a> for Nathan Fillion&#8217;s character, you&#8217;ll see that it looks like the characters arms are not attached to his body. That has fans thinking that this is merely a new version of Arm-Fall-Off Boy, whose name makes it pretty clear what his &#8220;powers&#8221; are. As for what TDK stands for, rumors have said that the character&#8217;s name may be The Detachable Kid. We&#8217;re pretty sure he&#8217;ll be among the first to die.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-633155 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-rollcall-seangunn-700x325.jpg\" alt=\"James Gunn's The Suicide Squad - Sean Gunn\" width=\"700\" height=\"325\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-rollcall-seangunn-700x325.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-rollcall-seangunn-360x167.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-rollcall-seangunn-768x356.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-rollcall-seangunn.jpg 1067w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<h2>Sean Gunn is Weasel</h2>\n<p>Sean Gunn served as the on-set stand-in for Rocket Raccoon in the <em>Guardians</em> movies. But in <em>The Suicide Squad</em>, he&#8217;s playing a much more grotesque animal-like character. In the comics, Weasel began as John Monroe, a law student who was mocked by his peers and called the name Weasel. But as an adult under the name of Jack, he served as a teacher at Vandemeer University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Seeing some of his fellow students as professors who posed a threat to his own tenure, he dressed up as a weasel and killed them.</p>\n<p>However, it appears James Gunn may be taking some liberties with the character, because it appears to be a man-sized, anthropomorphic weasel, almost looking like a terrible taxidermy job come to life. Is he really a weasel, or just a man in a complex suit?</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-633149 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-rollcall-kingshark-700x316.jpg\" alt=\"James Gunn's The Suicide Squad - King Shark\" width=\"700\" height=\"316\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-rollcall-kingshark-700x316.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-rollcall-kingshark-360x163.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-rollcall-kingshark-768x347.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-rollcall-kingshark.jpg 1070w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<h2>King Shark as Himself</h2>\n<p>Here&#8217;s King Shark, do-do-dodo-do! All right, so King Shark isn&#8217;t actually playing himself, but he&#8217;s the only character in the roll call video who didn&#8217;t have an actor&#8217;s name paired with him. However, during the panel, it was revealed that <strong>Steve Agee</strong> was the on-set version of the character, presumably in the same way that Sean Gunn played Rocket Raccoon. But that means the voice of the character is someone different, possibly <strong>Taika Waititi</strong>, whose role in the movie has yet to be revealed.</p>\n<p>King Shark, aka Nanaue, is just a humanoid shark and son of &#8220;The King of All Sharks.&#8221; Like a real shark, his skin protects him from the pressures of the deep sea and makes him resilient to physical attacks. Clearly he also has shark teeth used for deadly attacks, and he can breathe underwater and swim extremely fast. He&#8217;s super strong and can regenerate his body tissue. He also likes to eat people.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">***</p>\n<p>So there you have it. James Gunn has said that we shouldn&#8217;t get too attached to a lot of these characters because most of them are probably going to die. They&#8217;re part of the Suicide Squad after all, so it&#8217;s kind of in the job description. I&#8217;m willing to bet that many of them will be comedically dispatched with, not unlike X-Force in <em>Deadpool 2</em>. That should make this all the more fun, which will be a nice turnaround from the 2016 edition of Suicide Squad.</p>\n<p>James Gunn&#8217;s <em>The Suicide Squad</em> is slated to hit theaters

world need? Enough to fuel the workload of Project X Entertainment, the team behind the upcoming <em>Scream</em> revival which has set its eyes on a piece of classic comedy IP: <strong><em>The Nutty Professor</em></strong>. Project X Entertainment&#8217;s<strong> James Vanderbilt</strong>, <strong>William Sherak</strong>, and <strong>Paul Neinstein</strong> are looking to develop another <em>The Nutty Professor</em> remake, the latest version of the classic Jerry Lewis comedy that Murphy rebooted in the &#8217;90s.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-633247\"></span></p>\n<p>The Jerry Lewis 1963 <em>The Nutty Professor</em> is considered a comedy classic — a widely acclaimed spoof on Robert Louis Stevenson&#8217;s 1886 novella Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Murphy&#8217;s 1996 remake added a few fat suits and a goofy slapstick twist. So what else can you do with <em>The Nutty Professor</em>? Based on Vanderbilt, Sherak, and Neinstein&#8217;s track record, I&#8217;m guessing a gritty reboot.</p>\n<p>Deadline reports that Project X has landed the rights to <em>The Nutty Professor</em> with an intention to remake the classic comedy IP. No studio is currently attached, nor a writer or any other talent. Vanderbilt, who has penned scripts like <em>The Rundown, Zodiac</em>, and <em>The Amazing Spider-Man</em>, is just set to produce for now.</p>\n<p>News of <em>The Nutty Professor</em> remake comes on the heels of Project X&#8217;s forthcoming relaunch of the <em>Scream</em> franchise, which is reuniting original cast members Courteney Cox and David Arquette to star in a sequel and soft reboot that is being directed by <em>Ready Or Not</em> duo Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett. It&#8217;s a bit of an odd leap to go from <em>Scream</em> straight to <em>The Nutty Professor</em>, but if there&#8217;s one thing the two properties have in common (apart from a sly satirical edge), it&#8217;s the &#8220;brand-name&#8221; recognition. Project X seems to be making a living by bringing back classic properties, which has become an increasingly popular tactic as blockbusters dominate what&#8217;s left of the box office and now streaming services.</p>\n<p>The original <em>Nutty Professor</em> is widely acclaimed as a comedy classic from the late Lewis, and followed a nerdy professor who makes a potion that temporarily gives him the handsome, but abrasive, alter ego named Buddy Love. Universal&#8217;s 1996 reboot starred Murphy in a similar story, but in a fat suit, with Murphy also famously playing the professor&#8217;s five other family members (also in fat suits). The movie also spawned a sequel, <em>The Nutty Professor II: The Klumps</em>, which hit theaters in 2000. With <em>The Nutty Professor</em>, that makes the second recent property already once rebooted by Murphy to be remade once again. The first was the <em>Dolittle</em>, which Murphy headlined in the late &#8217;90s and which Universal relaunched as a disastrous family comedy starring Robert Downey Jr. <em>Dolittle</em> is definitely not becoming a new franchise, so maybe Downey Jr. could don the suspenders and appear in this remake, too.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-nutty-professor-remake-project-x/\">&#8216;The Nutty Professor&#8217; Remake Coming From the &#8216;Scream&#8217; Reboot Team</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=6hf_MiE7reo:05A-C07pmCo:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=6hf_MiE7reo:05A-C07pmCo:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=6hf_MiE7reo:05A-C07pmCo:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=6hf_MiE7reo:05A-C07pmCo:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=6hf_MiE7reo:05A-C07pmCo:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=6hf_MiE7reo:05A-C07pmCo:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/6hf_MiE7reo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 18:30:06 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-nutty-professor-e1598287208586-700x316.jpg","linkMd5":"bed5a9992b20d2007bd27c1e44acb201","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn7@2020_5/2020/08/24/19-10-59-064_aa84b59ea21e5cd0.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":316,"sourceBytes":39984,"destBytes":25554,"author":"Hoai-Tran Bui","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-nutty-professor-e1598287208586-700x316.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn7@2020_5/2020/08/24/19-10-59-064_aa84b59ea21e5cd0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn52@2020_6/2020/08/24/19-11-37-285_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=6hf_MiE7reo:05A-C07pmCo:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn88@2020_3/2020/08/24/19-11-37-383_7af693ed09ac54e4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn72@2020_6/2020/08/24/19-11-42-882_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=6hf_MiE7reo:05A-C07pmCo:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn20@2020_1/2020/08/24/19-11-38-484_d544d1c823262ce1.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/6hf_MiE7reo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn76@2020_6/2020/08/24/19-11-38-622_bab8bd3cfa9ed46d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598296258501},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 03:10:58","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 03:10:58","title":"‘The Batman’ Trailer Breakdown: All the Clues and Details You May Have Missed","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=633175","description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-batman-trailer-breakdown.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-633251\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-batman-trailer-breakdown-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"the batman trailer breakdown\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-batman-trailer-breakdown-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-batman-trailer-breakdown-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-batman-trailer-breakdown-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-batman-trailer-breakdown.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong><em>The Batman</em></strong> trailer arrived during DC FanDome, and it did not disappoint. Even though<strong> Matt Reeves</strong> and company only shot a small portion of the film before having to shut down production due to coronavirus, the filmmaker was still able to cut together a solid, atmospheric look at the latest take on the Dark Knight. It has the trappings we&#8217;d expect from a <em>Batman</em> flick: it&#8217;s moody, it&#8217;s gothic, it has lots of scenes of people standing in the rain. But it also looks different. Grungier. Scarier. It almost looks like a remake of <em>Seven</em> (or <em>Se7en</em>, if you want to be a jerk about it) that just happens to feature Batman.

We see a masked figure tearing off strips of duct tape while someone either unconscious or dead is sprawled out on the floor. Suddenly, we cut to that same sprawled figure now sitting in a chair, his entire head wrapped in tape. If he wasn&#8217;t dead before he&#8217;s definitely dead now, and he comes bearing a message: NO MORE LIES. The trailer isn&#8217;t giving this away yet, but the duct tape-killer is <em>supposed</em> to be the Riddler, as played by <strong>Paul Dano</strong>.</p>\n<p>Or is he? It is interesting that the trailer is hiding this figure&#8217;s face, and later, when we hear him talking, his voice has been distorted. It <em>sort of</em> sounds like Dano&#8217;s voice to me, but since I can&#8217;t be 100% sure, it&#8217;s all guesswork at this point. I&#8217;m sure if the trailer (and film) are hiding the killer&#8217;s identity there&#8217;s <em>some</em> reason. We just don&#8217;t know what it is yet.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-9.39.56-AM.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-633180\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-9.39.56-AM-700x277.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"277\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-9.39.56-AM-700x277.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-9.39.56-AM-360x142.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-9.39.56-AM-768x304.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p>From here the trailer kicks in in earnest, complete with Nirvana performing the moody, ominous &#8220;Something In the Way.&#8221; Props to Reeves and company for <em>not</em> using an even slower cover version, as is the trend for most trailers these days. That said, the original Nirvana version does give way to an orchestrated version arranged by the film&#8217;s composer, <strong>Michael Giacchino</strong>.</p>\n<p>But let&#8217;s talk about this shot. We&#8217;re following Jim Gordon (<strong>Jeffrey Wright</strong>), who is clearly not commissioner yet, but appears instead to still be a detective. FBI agents are flanking Gordon as he strolls down a long hallway that appears to be at the same crime scene the trailer started with. But those agents aren&#8217;t looking at Gordon – they&#8217;re looking at someone following him. I wonder who it could be?! (It&#8217;s Batman.)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-9.40.08-AM.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-633181\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-9.40.08-AM-700x282.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"282\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-9.40.08-AM-700x282.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-9.40.08-AM-360x145.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-9.40.08-AM-768x309.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Gordon (or perhaps another cop) finds an envelope on the body of the man who met his end via duct tape. &#8220;From your secret friend,&#8221; we hear Gordon read. &#8220;Who?

Maroni is a mob boss in the world of <em>Batman</em> – he plays a big part in <em>The Long Halloween</em>, and even popped up in Christopher Nolan&#8217;s <em>The Dark Knight</em> as played by Eric Roberts. In the comics, Maroni is the one who disfigures District Attorney Harvey Dent and turns him into Two-Face. As far as we know, Harvey Dent isn&#8217;t in <em>The Batman</em>, but there is another DA character played by <strong>Peter Sarsgaard</strong>. And what of Maroni? Just because he&#8217;s mentioned in that headline doesn&#8217;t mean he appears in the film. We do know the mob will be part of the film, though, as <strong>John Turturro</strong> is playing mob boss Carmine Falcone.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-9.41.09-AM.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-633185\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-9.41.09-AM-700x287.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"287\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-9.41.09-AM-700x287.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-9.41.09-AM-360x147.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-9.41.09-AM-768x315.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;WHAT DOES A LIAR DO WHEN HE&#8217;S DEAD?&#8221; a card asks, complete with mysterious symbols signifying the answer.

There was some of this in <em>The Dark Knight</em>, with Batman showing up at the bank the Joker robbed in the prologue and talking with Gordon. But Christopher Nolan made a point of having that scene be isolated, and even on the down-low. <em>The Batman</em> changes things up by having Batman just out in the open, in front of both Gordon, FBI agents, and a bunch of cops. This confirms this isn&#8217;t just another origin story. Batman isn&#8217;t some mystery: cops are well-aware of him, and even okay with him scoping out crime scenes. It&#8217;s also establishing the whole &#8220;Batman is the world&#8217;s greatest detective!&#8221; thing, an angle that the previous movies really haven&#8217;t touched on at all.</p>\n<p>As for the Batsuit Pattinson is wearing: I dig it. It looks much more cobbled-together than previous bat-costumes, which is exactly the point – we&#8217;re supposed to believe Bruce Wayne made this from scratch.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-9.41.44-AM.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-633188\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-9.41.44-AM-700x289.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"289\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-9.41.44-AM-700x289.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-9.41.44-AM-360x149.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-9.41.44-AM-768x317.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Our basic premise established – Batman investigates murder! – the trailer then moves into setting a mood while also making the most of the limited footage Reeves and company shot.

It&#8217;s funnyman Richard Kind! Oh, wait, no. It&#8217;s actually <strong>Colin Farrell</strong> as the Penguin. When the trailer dropped, many people (myself included) realized that this was <em>probably</em> Farrell. But the make-up is so good here it renders Farrell unrecognizable. So unrecognizable, in fact, that many refused to accept it. I even saw one person on Twitter swear up and down that Farrell hadn&#8217;t even filmed scenes yet (even though he&#8217;s been spotted on the set of the movie multiple times). But let&#8217;s put this to rest: the film&#8217;s makeup artist, <strong>Michael Marino</strong>, confirmed via his <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CEPAzHAHB7r/\">Instagram</a> account that this is indeed Farrell.</p>\n<p>Once you get over your shock, you might be wondering why they&#8217;d cast handsome man Colin Farrell and bury him in makeup, but hey, that&#8217;s the magic of movies, baby. And I really can&#8217;t wait to see what Farrell does with this role (and makeup).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-9.43.48-AM.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-633201\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-9.43.48-AM-700x282.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"282\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-9.43.48-AM-700x282.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-9.43.48-AM-360x145.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-9.43.48-AM-768x309.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-9.44.02-AM.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-633202\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-9.44.02-AM-700x286.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"286\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-9.44.02-AM-700x286.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-9.44.02-AM-360x147.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-9.44.02-AM-768x314.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;If you are justice, please do not lie! What is the price for your blind eye?&#8221; a voice asks. Again: this <em>sounds</em> like Paul Dano&#8217;s voice, but there&#8217;s definitely a distortion over it, so I can&#8217;t be sure. In any case, while we hear Riddler (?) talking, we see Batman getting into a scuffle with several cops. So while Batman can stroll into crime scenes, there still appears to be some tension between him and law enforcement. Gordon actually has to push Batman off a cop in the middle of the brawl.

Bat-action has been a bit lacking in the <em>Batman</em> movies. The Tim Burton/Joel Schumacher Batman suffered from a rather bulky suit that made a lot of fighting hard to shoot. The Nolan Batsuit evolved over time, but Nolan also shot much of his fight scenes in a jittery, hard-to-follow way. Many people praised the Batman beat-down from <em>Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice</em>, but even that looked very stagey, enhanced by special effects. This is different – the camera almost never cuts away, and it looks <em>brutal</em>. Batman looks like he&#8217;s really hurting this guy. I could do without the &#8220;I&#8217;m <i>vengeance</i>!&#8221; line, but Batman is nothing if not overdramatic.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-9.46.00-AM.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-633211\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-9.46.00-AM-700x283.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"283\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-9.46.00-AM-700x283.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-9.46.00-AM-360x146.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-9.46.00-AM-768x310.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a> <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-9.46.07-AM.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-633212\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-9.46.07-AM-700x286.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"286\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-9.46.07-AM-700x286.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-9.46.07-AM-360x147.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-9.46.07-AM-768x314.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p>All Batmobiles must have something that shoots some sort of fire out of the back.

Again: Reeves talked about how the mystery at the center of the film is tied to the Wayne family in some way, so that&#8217;s clearly what&#8217;s being referenced here. We just don&#8217;t know what the endgame is. But I do love that we can see the eyeshadow on Pattinson&#8217;s face – it&#8217;s a nice touch in a trailer full of nice touches.</p>\n<p><em>The Batman</em> opens <strong>October 1</strong>,<strong> 2021</strong>.
