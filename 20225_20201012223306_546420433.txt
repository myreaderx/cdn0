You might have shared that experience with your users with a <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/assistant/directory#web_directory\">directory weblink</a>, which is the URL for your Action in the <a href=\"https://assistant.google.com/explore\">Assistant Directory</a>. If a user clicks on the directory weblink, it sends them to the Action Profile on the Assistant Directory.</p><figure><img alt=\"An example of an Action’s profile in the Directory\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*RuUJUMEi2XRcBjro\" /><figcaption>An example of an Action’s profile in the Directory</figcaption></figure><p>However, with <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/assistant/engagement/action-links\">Action Links</a>, you can send users from their mobile web browser directly into the Google Assistant and your Action!</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*lCMdS_pHT02enqc6HkFppg.gif\" /><figcaption>gif of clicking link opening an Action Link</figcaption></figure><p>You can generate an Action link in the Actions console. Below, I am making an Action link for my Welcome intent. That way, I can share this URL through my website or marketing campaigns, and users who click on it will launch my Action on Google Assistant. If they are not on a Google Assistant-enabled device, it’ll take them to the Assistant Directory.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*DxKlviClMFKWoWd6hMeeyQ.gif\" /><figcaption>gif of the action link work flow</figcaption></figure><p>You can add Action links to more than just your Welcome intent. Let’s say you added some cool features to your Action, like <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/assistant/engagement/daily\">Daily Updates</a>, <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/assistant/transactions\">Transactions</a> or <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/assistant/identity\">Account Linking</a>. You’d want to share that part to your users or highlight it in a campaign. If you’re using <a href=\"https://dialogflow.com/\">Dialogflow</a>, you can add the intent of the new functionality as an implicit invocation. In the example below, I’m adding the intent <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/assistant/conversational/helpers#account_sign-in\">signIn</a> to the implicit invocation list. Then, clicking <strong>Test</strong> takes me into the Actions console, where I can add an Action link to signIn and share that path with users.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*uS1t2Z8-TTL9-btcjvHLlQ.gif\" /><figcaption>gif of clicking link opening an Action Link</figcaption></figure><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*1p8RjX_s13PIwadYWTu5HA.gif\" /><figcaption>gif of the action link work flow</figcaption></figure><p>Want to try out an Action Link?
