While Canon currently offers a handful of long RF lenses (including the well-reviewed <a aria-label=\"RF 100-500mm f/4.5-7.1L IS USM (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://geni.us/CanonRF100-500L\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" class=\"ek-link\">RF 100-500mm f/4.5-7.1L IS USM</a>), the narrow maximum apertures are a dealbreaker for serious <a aria-label=\"action (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/take-better-action-photos/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">action</a> and <a aria-label=\"low-light photography (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-shoot-in-low-light-9-commonly-asked-questions/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">low-light photography</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Canon RF 100mm f/2.8L Macro will debut as a mirrorless successor to the popular <a aria-label=\"Canon EF 100mm f/2.8L (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://geni.us/Canon100mmf2-8MacrodPS\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" class=\"ek-link\">Canon EF 100mm f/2.8L Macro</a>, an ultra-sharp, close-focusing lens used by <a aria-label=\"macro (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/macro-photography-for-beginners-part-1/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">macro</a> enthusiasts and professionals alike, plus <a aria-label=\"product photographers (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/practical-tips-doing-commercial-product-photography/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">product photographers</a> and event photographers for <a aria-label=\"key detail shots (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/4-easy-and-unique-ways-to-light-and-photograph-wedding-rings/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">key detail shots</a>. Of course, the price remains to be seen (currently, the Canon EF 100mm f/2.8L goes for around $1300 USD, though when I bought mine &#8211; around five years ago &#8211; the price was a more tolerable $750 USD).

So if any of the above glass interests you, I’d highly recommend you buy while products remain available. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now over to you:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>How do you feel about Canon’s decision to discontinue these lenses?

Then you can show them to your model so they know what you want them to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">(In fact, the author of the app has <a href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/8-posing-guides-to-inspire-your-portraiture/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"written several articles about posing (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">written several articles about posing</a> for Digital Photography School you will find useful!)</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 data-section id=\"during-the-shoot\">During the shoot</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>No matter how experienced or inexperienced your model is, here are some tips to help you capture the perfect pose during the shoot:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 data-section id=\"build-rapport\">5. Build rapport</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is essential. If your model likes you and sees what you are trying to achieve, they will work harder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Talk to your model about things they like; this will help produce more life in their eyes and get <a aria-label=\"better expressions (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/poser-achieve-perfect-portrait-expression/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">better expressions</a>, including natural smiles. And they&#8217;ll be more relaxed. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if your model is tense, you are going to struggle to get natural-looking portraits. In that case, take the pressure off the model and bring it back on yourself. Assure them that if the photos don&#8217;t work out, it&#8217;s your fault, not theirs. Build their confidence.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 data-section id=\"look-for-natural-expressions\">6. Look for natural expressions</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As you talk to your model, you will notice natural expressions and mannerisms that you can capture. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don&#8217;t be afraid to say &#8220;Hold that pose!&#8221; or &#8220;Do that again.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image caption-align-left size-full wp-image-68388 is-style-with-caption\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><span class=\"responsive-image wp-image-68388\" style=\"width:400px\"><span class=\"space\" style=\"width:400px; padding-top:150%\"></span><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"400\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/posing-models-5.jpg?resize=400%2C600&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"people posing photography\" class=\"wp-image-68388\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/posing-models-5.jpg?w=400&#38;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/posing-models-5.jpg?resize=200%2C300&#38;ssl=1 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></span><figcaption>I noticed that this model had an interesting mannerism, so I asked her to repeat the gesture. The result turned out to be one of her favorites!</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h3 data-section id=\"adapt-poses\">7. Adapt poses</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When you suggest a pose to your model &#8211; such as a pose used in another photo or a pose from the Posing App &#8211; treat it as a starting point. Then adapt it to suit the model. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In other words: If your model looks unnatural in a certain pose, then change it! Adjust each pose to suit your model&#8217;s body and clothes.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image caption-align-left size-full wp-image-68386 is-style-with-caption\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><span class=\"responsive-image wp-image-68386\" style=\"width:600px\"><span class=\"space\" style=\"width:600px; padding-top:74.83%\"></span><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"449\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/posing-models-3.jpg?resize=600%2C449&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"woman posing against a wall\" class=\"wp-image-68386\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/posing-models-3.jpg?w=600&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/posing-models-3.jpg?resize=300%2C225&#38;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></span><figcaption>The pose on the left is one I found in the Posing App. For the second portrait, I asked my model to drop her left arm so I couldn&#8217;t see it. Don&#8217;t be afraid to tweak poses; sometimes a small change makes a big difference.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h3 data-section id=\"simplify\">8. Simplify</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep everything as simple as possible. This applies to composition, as well as the clothes and jewelry your model is wearing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your model has too much jewelry, ask them to remove some. It&#8217;ll improve the composition. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re struggling to find a good full-length pose, move in closer and shoot from the waist up, or do a head-and-shoulders portrait. The background will go more out of focus, and there will be less of the model in the photo (i.e., the shot will be simplified!).</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image caption-align-left size-full wp-image-68387 is-style-with-caption\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><span class=\"responsive-image wp-image-68387\" style=\"width:600px\"><span class=\"space\" style=\"width:600px; padding-top:74.83%\"></span><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"449\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/posing-models-4.jpg?resize=600%2C449&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"woman posing simply\" class=\"wp-image-68387\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/posing-models-4.jpg?w=600&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/posing-models-4.jpg?resize=300%2C225&#38;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></span><figcaption>Simplification in action.

So if you&#8217;re looking to understand <em>what </em>golden hour actually is, or if you want to improve your golden hour images with some expert tips, you&#8217;ve come to the right place. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s dive right in with a simple definition:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 data-section id=\"what-is-the-golden-hour-in-photography\">What is the golden hour in photography?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The golden hours are (roughly) the first hour after sunrise&#160;and the last hour before sunset. But the length of the golden hours can vary depending upon your geographical location and the current season. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><span class=\"responsive-image wp-image-125788\" style=\"width:750px\"><span class=\"space\" style=\"width:750px; padding-top:66.67%\"></span><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"750\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Golden_Hour_19.jpg?resize=750%2C500&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"golden hour photography dog in grass\" class=\"wp-image-125788\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Golden_Hour_19.jpg?w=750&#38;ssl=1 750w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Golden_Hour_19.jpg?resize=300%2C200&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Golden_Hour_19.jpg?resize=600%2C400&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Golden_Hour_19.jpg?resize=90%2C60&#38;ssl=1 90w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Golden_Hour_19.jpg?resize=717%2C478&#38;ssl=1 717w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></span></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>What makes this lighting situation so great for photography?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The sun&#8217;s position in the sky. Because the sun is at a low angle, it goes through more of Earth&#8217;s atmosphere before striking your subject. This produces soft, diffused, <em>flattering </em>light.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Generally speaking, <a aria-label=\"soft light (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/the-magic-of-soft-light/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">soft light</a> is a photographer&#8217;s best friend.

Observe the sky the day before your photoshoot</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The best way to figure out when the golden hour will be at its peak is by observation! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Peek out of the window the day before your photo session. See how the sun moves and how the light changes. Because the sun&#8217;s position and timing change very little from one day to the next, that will allow you to get a better idea of what the lighting situation will be like on the day of your shoot.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><span class=\"responsive-image wp-image-124833\" style=\"width:750px\"><span class=\"space\" style=\"width:750px; padding-top:66.67%\"></span><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"750\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Golden-Hour-13-1.jpg?resize=750%2C500&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"puppy at golden hour\" class=\"wp-image-124833\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Golden-Hour-13-1.jpg?w=750&#38;ssl=1 750w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Golden-Hour-13-1.jpg?resize=300%2C200&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Golden-Hour-13-1.jpg?resize=600%2C400&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Golden-Hour-13-1.jpg?resize=90%2C60&#38;ssl=1 90w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Golden-Hour-13-1.jpg?resize=717%2C478&#38;ssl=1 717w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></span></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 data-section id=\"plan-your-photo-session-in-advance\">2.
