It have been a great place to meet interesting people and share ideas. At every conference I have met new people who said they were following us on this blog. All good things have their run and now ours is over. I hope you stay in touch with us through our individual blogs. I want to close with a look at an interesting study on the positive impact of Web 2.0. Ironically, the label the most tech savvy people in the study as the tech fast forward group.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.communispace.com/home.aspx\">Communispace</a>, in partnership with Ogilvy &#38; Mather, recently released findings from a joint research study that examines the impact technology has on the lives of today’s consumer, with a specific focus on the role technology plays on children and  family life in our society. The ‘<a href=\"http://www.communispace.com/techfastforward\">Tech Fast Forward: Plug in to See the Brighter Side of Life</a>’ study evaluates the optimistic outlook associated with tech-savvy kids and their respective families and draws direct correlations to the resulting implications for marketers and brands.</p>\n<p>In two phases of research, they surveyed 1200 US parents with children aged 3–12 in the household and qualitatively explored key topics with 112 tech-savvy community members and their kids. In the first portion they identified 5 segments: tech backward 3%, tech neutral 36%, tech forward 42% , and tech fast forward 19%. Ten they looked more closely the last group. Here is a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjbHkDTaMlg.\">video of the qualitative portion of the research</a>, including footage from Flip cameras given to participants (children ages 3-12 years old) tasked with recording in-home technology-related behavior.</p>\n<p>The vast majority of all segments saw technology as a positive force in their lives (84%) with the tech fast forward slightly ahead (87%) on this measure. In a related question: Will technology make of break us? All segments respond make 72% of the time and 85% of the fast forward said make. When asked if technology better connect or creates more distance, 72% of all segments said better connect and 80% of the tech fast forward sided with this view.   This is an overall quite positive view and one that I share.  The tech fast forward group is also more optimistic about the future.</p>\n<p>Some of the key implications identified in the study that enable brands to more effectively connect with and reach the Tech Forward consumer include (mostly in their words with some additional comments):</p>\n<p><strong>Mobilize tech optimism:</strong> Brands have the opportunity to capitalize on today’s tech optimism by helping consumers create the brighter world they want to see.</p>\n<p><strong>Mine the family mindset:</strong> As intergenerational attitudes converge, opportunities to market to the family as a unit increase. Purchase decisions are family decisions.</p>\n<p><strong>Curate unexpected connections:</strong> Brands have the opportunity to bring unimagined access to consumers across the globe and should harness the power of connections in more interesting ways. We like this idea at Darwin.</p>\n<p><strong>Put the world to work for you:</strong> Technology has unleashed the wisdom of the crowd and brands can build on tech optimism to channel their customers’ creativity.</p>\n<p><strong>Respect the mode:</strong> Consumers today switch between modes of separation and integration, and seek service and product solutions to help them feel in control.  Brands will benefit by providing a flexible feature set that speaks to the multi-modal life.</p>\n<p><strong>Un-connect the dots:</strong> Consumers want to interpret your brand—to make your brand’s story their own. So give them the building blocks and let them put the pieces together. I like this one. This is what we do at Darwin, enable people to better connect the dots themselves through content visualizations rather than prescriptive top down search.</p>\n<p><strong>Build gated communities</strong>: Safety and privacy create major barriers for self-expression online; private communities help consumers feel secure and confident when engaging with your brand online. This is what Communispace does quite well.</p>\n<p><strong>Let people mess with your brand:</strong> The creative impulse abounds, and today, any and all content is fair game for experimentation, adaptation and reinterpretation. This includes your brand!  Companies need to embrace this trend and enable consumers to reimagine and remix brand assets. I like this one best of all. There is much more in the report that is available for free.</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading this blog over the past few years. I hope to stay connected to each of you.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/fastforwardblog/SYEL?a=wASBrD0aUbM:3c5TCrjUE9k:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img
