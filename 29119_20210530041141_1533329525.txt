Loyalty programs encourage engagement and reward your most loyal fans, all while driving sales and boosting retention. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While there are many moving parts to developing a rewards program, having a robust customer loyalty email strategy can go a long way. </span></p>\n<h2><strong>What reward emails can do for you</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reward emails are messages that keep customers up to date with your loyalty program.

However, if your company does have a rewards program, you can use emails to amplify the impact.</span></p>\n<p><img class=\"\" src=\"https://www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1-26.png\" alt=\"loyalty program tips reward emails\" width=\"700\" height=\"424\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Within your loyalty program, reward emails are critical for:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Educating customers about the loyalty program</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Welcoming them into the program and letting them know what comes next</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Encouraging customers to take advantage of their rewards</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Presenting new ways to earn points</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sharing exclusive offers and campaigns</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sending targeted campaigns based on account activity</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sounds interesting? Let’s explore examples to inspire your own loyalty email campaigns.</span></p>\n<h2><strong>8 loyalty program email examples to learn from</strong></h2>\n<h3><strong>Loyalty program invitation</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first point in the customer loyalty</span><a href=\"https://www.getvero.com/resources/lifecycle-marketing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> lifecycle</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that you can leverage email for is gaining new community members. You’ll likely have signup CTAs for your loyalty program throughout your marketing channels, website, and app.</span></p>\n<p>But by sending a signup email to your existing customers, you can boost engagement by leveraging already established connections.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To introduce their loyalty program, </span><a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/pin/342836590370329955/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Loeffler Randall</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> offers an exclusive bonus for signing up. The email has a time-sensitive deal, and it also outlines what to expect afterwards. Intro emails are the perfect place to set expectations about earning and using reward points. </span></p>\n<p><img class=\"\" src=\"https://www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/LoefflerRandall.jpg\" alt=\"Loeffler Randall reward emails example\" width=\"564\" height=\"1981\" /></p>\n<h4><strong>Automate it</strong></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your loyalty program </span><a href=\"https://www.getvero.com/resources/welcome-emails/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">welcome email</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> will have the best chances of success with careful </span><a href=\"https://www.getvero.com/resources/audience-segmentation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">segmentation</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Rather than blasting the email to everybody, begin sending the message to already engaged users or repeat customers. You could also </span><a href=\"https://www.getvero.com/resources/dynamic-content/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">dynamically update content</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to match each segment&#8217;s interests or goals. </span></p>\n<h3><strong>Welcome to the VIP program</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each new loyalty program member deserves a warm welcome! An email to initiate them into the group should reiterate the perks and what communication to expect. If a person signs up for the program via a descriptive email, you may modify the welcome message so that it isn’t redundant.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>However, welcome emails are perfect for people who register via your website or app.</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, Taco Bell runs a rewards program through its app and sends a welcome email upon registration. It lists what you can do within the app to make ordering easier, and covers how to earn and redeem points. There’s also an animation that says that Taco Bell will be sending emails and push notifications from now on. </span></p>\n<p><img class=\"\" src=\"https://www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2-9.jpg\" alt=\"Taco Bell reward email example\" width=\"700\" height=\"2078\" /></p>\n<h4><strong>Automate it</strong></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Different loyalty program features or rewards may be more enticing for various </span><a href=\"https://www.getvero.com/resources/email-segmentation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">customer segments</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Therefore, </span><a href=\"https://www.getvero.com/resources/glossary/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A/B testing</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> welcome emails across your list can help you nail down ideal positioning. You can also use triggered workflows to send different welcome emails depending on how a customer signed up. </span></p>\n<h3><strong>Exclusive offers</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Part of the fun of having a loyalty program is offering exclusive offers and perks. Sending an email with a discount, or way to earn more points can encourage sales. </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/pin/342836590361135249/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Starbucks</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> does this by issuing a challenge to reward members. They can earn additional points, but </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">only</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> if they purchase five Frappuccinos before a set date. Giving a specific task can drive sales or engagement with a particular product, and requiring multiple actions can help establish a new habit. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img class=\"\" src=\"https://www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-9-12.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"486\" /></span></p>\n<h4><strong>Automate it</strong></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you collaborate with other marketing or sales teams, you can use email as a driver for specific initiatives. You can create one-off campaigns to drive engagement with an item and target it at users who have shown interest in the past. </span></p>\n<h3><strong>Birthday and anniversary perks</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Everyone has a birthday that you can send exclusive offers on. If you don’t have a customer’s birthday info on file, you can also use rewards emails on the anniversary of their first purchase with you. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Birthday emails are fun and should have an enticing gift. For some companies, that’s a discount or an exclusive item for sale. </span><a href=\"https://reallygoodemails.com/emails/hurry-your-birthday-cookie-is-going-to-crumble-soon\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Subway</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, however, celebrates with a cookie. The email is direct (and who can resist the image of a giant cookie?), and tells customers how to redeem the offer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img class=\"\" src=\"https://www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-4-12.jpg\" alt=\"Subway reward email example\" width=\"700\" height=\"979\" /></span></p>\n<h4><strong>Automate it</strong></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether you choose to celebrate your customers’ birthdate or the entire month, automated email sequences put the party on autopilot. If you don’t collect birthday information, create an event when they make their first purchase, and then time the anniversary email for exactly a year later. </span></p>\n<h3><strong>Gamify and contest</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since your loyalty program has your biggest fans, you can use that audience to learn about customer preferences. Running contests creates user-generated content or pulls in feedback to help direct strategy. </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://reallygoodemails.com/emails/win-free-holiday-cards-contest\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Postable</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> used this tactic by having customers vote on their favorite holiday card for a chance to win $150 in free products. By getting customer feedback, the company can learn about what will likely sell best and create social proof around the “top-rated” card. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img class=\"\" src=\"https://www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-5-8.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"913\" /></span></p>\n<h4><strong>Automate it</strong></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contests and games improve engagement, so you can use them strategically to collaborate with user segments. For example, you can create contests when you want to learn more about a </span><a href=\"https://www.getvero.com/resources/what-you-need-to-know-about-psychographic-segmentation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">psychographic segment</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Then, use campaign analytics and results to inform your other marketing strategies.  </span></p>\n<h3><strong>Referral codes</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We’ve previously written about </span><a href=\"https://www.getvero.com/resources/referral-emails/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">referral emails</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, but it’s a good idea to send referral codes to loyalty program members. You can update these referral emails to include exclusive referral codes or deals. Since these are your most-engaged customers, you want to make the program feel more premium. </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://reallygoodemails.com/emails/spread-the-love-and-get-paid\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MeUndies</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> offers a discount code for new customers and $20 cashback for the referrer. The company simply explains the reward and has a bold CTA button to act now. </span></p>\n<p><img class=\"\" src=\"https://www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-6-12.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"1315\" /></p>\n<h4><strong>Automate it</strong></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Referral reward emails work best when you send them to customers who are engaged and likely to bring in quality leads. To </span><a href=\"https://www.getvero.com/resources/b2b-marketing-automation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">automate referral emails</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, set up an event that notifies a high level of engagement, such as repeated purchases or frequent logins. </span></p>\n<h3><strong>Reminder to redeem</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes customers need a little reminder, and emails are perfect for sending loyalty program nudges. Typing the data from your loyalty program into your email marketing with a tool like </span><a href=\"https://www.getvero.com/email-personalization-liquid-guide/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Liquid makes timely automations easy</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://reallygoodemails.com/emails/way-to-chipotle-you-earned-a-reward\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chipotle </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sends an email when customers earn a new reward and encourages them to log in to their account to see and redeem it. The email also prompts the customer to download their mobile app, making email marketing a driver for </span><a href=\"https://www.getvero.com/resources/multi-channel-marketing-what-you-need-to-know/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">multi-channel engagement</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><img class=\"\" src=\"https://www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-7-9.jpg\" alt=\"Chipotle reward email example\" width=\"700\" height=\"2035\" /></p>\n<h4><strong>Automate it</strong></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reminder emails have to be linked to your loyalty program to send out on time. You can also </span><a href=\"https://www.getvero.com/event-manager/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">set up triggers</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that send additional reminder emails if the reward goes unclaimed.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>Re-engagement</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If loyalty program members have gone quiet, consider sending a re-engagement or </span><a href=\"https://www.getvero.com/resources/winback-campaigns\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">winback campaign</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Remind users of the perks, or offer them an incentive to come back into the fold. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Home sent an email letting previous members know that the “perks just got perkier.” While they didn’t go into details in the email, there was a full breakdown of new incentives on the other side of the email. They also dynamically pulled in the recipient’s preferred store as a reminder. </span></p>\n<p><img class=\"\" src=\"https://www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-8-4.jpg\" alt=\"At Home reward email example\" width=\"700\" height=\"1500\" /></p>\n<h4><strong>Automate it</strong></h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.getvero.com/resources/dynamic-content/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dynamic content</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> allows you to pull past items a customer has purchased, the content they’ve engaged with, or stores they’ve shopped at. Personalizing the re-engagement email is more likely to jog their memory and entice them back than a generic blast. </span></p>\n<h2><strong>Loyalty program best practices</strong></h2>\n<h3><strong>Be flexible with rewards</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a rewards program is too rigid, it starts to lose its appeal. For example, imagine you have a go-to order at a restaurant that you choose frequently and earn points from. But then, you’re only allowed to redeem the points on one very specific food item that you’re not interested in. No fun!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can have reward categories at certain levels like </span><a href=\"https://app.starbucks.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Starbucks</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> does, but they should still be flexible. </span></p>\n<h3><strong>Create engagement tiers</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another popular loyalty program addition is </span><a href=\"https://blog.smile.io/tiered-program-loyalty/#:~:text=Tiers%20are%20a%20phenomenal%20way,pass%20a%20pre%2Ddetermined%20milestone.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">engagement tiers</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. As customers spend and engage more, they move up the ranks of your program and receive new benefits. Gamifying this process gives excited customers something to strive for.</span></p>\n<p>For example, each dollar spent equates to more points as a customer rises the ranks of Elf’s “Beauty Squad.”</p>\n<p><img class=\"\" src=\"https://www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Tiered-Programs-elf-BeautySquad-Tiers.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"917\" height=\"924\" /></p>\n<h3><strong>Use triggered emails and messages to boost engagement</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every customer is unique, and you can use email automation to make your marketing feel custom-made. Segment users based on their level of activity, interests, and past purchases, and you can  bring in dynamic content.</span></p>\n<p>When you use <a href=\"https://www.getvero.com/resources/create-personalized-messages-faster/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Liquid to connect</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> your loyalty program to a marketing automation service like Vero, you can create triggers to send targeted emails at scale. </span></p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/dynamiccontent.png\" alt=\"Liquid Vero dynamic content\" width=\"465\" height=\"350\" /></p>\n<h3><strong>Grow the program with affiliates or partners</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you want to expand the reach or impact of your loyalty program, consider partnering up. Having loyalty program affiliates or partners brings related brands together to offer unique and relevant rewards to customers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, </span><a href=\"https://www.wyndhamhotels.com/wyndham-rewards/redeem/travel-points\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wyndham Rewards</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> partners with airline companies so that customers can redeem hotel points for airline miles.</span></p>\n<p><img class=\"\" src=\"https://www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-10-11.png\" alt=\"Wyndham airline miles reward email example\" width=\"700\" height=\"193\" /></p>\n<h3><strong>Review programs in your industry</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Loyalty program emails are a great way to increase the efficacy of your rewards program. However, you need a loyalty program before you can start sending these messages.
