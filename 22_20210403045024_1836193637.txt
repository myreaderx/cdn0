Always check a pet food label to ensure the food is AAFCO complete and balanced for your adult dog's life stage &#8212; \"maintenance\" for adults and \"growth\" for puppies and pregnant or lactating females.&#160;</p><p>For adult dogs, we recommend foods containing moderate protein (the AAFCO minimum is 18% for adults) and low to moderate fat. Pet owners often assume more protein is better since dogs evolved as carnivores, but this is not so, according to Kelly Swanson, PhD, professor of animal and nutritional sciences at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Domestic dogs are actually omnivorous and do not require extremely high protein concentrations in their diet. \"From a pet health perspective, the protein quality and digestibility are most important,\" he said.</p><p>When shopping for dog food, look for meat sources of protein such as whole meats and meat meals at the top of the ingredients list. Complementary proteins like rice and beans may also be included.&#160;Swanson likes to see fat concentrations below 20%, although he doesn't get too concerned about fat content for healthy-weight pets who do not have conditions like pancreatitis or gastrointestinal disease.</p><p>Veterinarian W. Jean Dodds, owner of Hemopet Holistic Care Veterinary Clinic, looks for a variety of nutrient-dense whole foods on the list. These include high quality meats or fish, some carbohydrates, a mixture of vegetables, and some fruit, including berries.&#160;</p><p>Many foods also contain extra ingredients like omega fatty acids for skin and coat health, probiotics for digestion, and glucosamine, chondroitin, and green-lipped mussels for joint support.</p><h3>Our picks for adult dry dog food:</h3><aside class=\"breakout-box headline-regular\"><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.chewy.com%2Fpurina-beyond-superfood-blend-wild%2Fdp%2F106870\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Purina Beyond Superfood Blend Wild-Caught Salmon, Egg, and Pumpkin Recipe (14.5-lb bag)<strong><br /></strong></a><strong><strong>Main protein sources: </strong></strong>Salmon, chicken meal<strong><br /></strong><strong>Standout carbohydrates: </strong>Barley, oatmeal, pumpkin<strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Healthy extras: </strong></strong>Omega fatty acids (fish oil), probiotics<strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Feeding trials:</strong></strong> No<strong><strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Best for: </strong></strong></strong>Active, normal-weight dogs<strong><strong><strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Nutrition breakdown: </strong></strong></strong></strong>26% protein, 16% fat, 4% fiber&#160;<strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Calorie count: </strong></strong></strong></strong></strong>437 kcal/cup<bi-shortcode id=\"commerce-link\" class=\"mceNonEditable\" data-cardtype=\"button\" data-pid=\"606729033d35010018fe0f88\" data-purchase-option=\"\">Beyond Superfood Blend Wild-Caught Salmon, Egg, and Pumpkin Recipe (14.5-lb bag) (button)</bi-shortcode></aside><aside class=\"breakout-box headline-regular\"><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.chewy.com%2Fmerrick-classic-healthy-grains-real%2Fdp%2F121736\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Merrick Classic Healthy Grains Real Beef and Brown Rice Recipe (25-lb. bag)<br /></a><strong>Main protein sources:</strong> Beef, pork meal<br /><strong>Standout carbohydrates:</strong> Brown rice, barley, oatmeal, quinoa, carrots, apples<br /><strong>Healthy extras:</strong> Omega fatty acids (flaxseed, salmon), glucosamine, chondroitin<br /><strong>Feeding Trials:</strong> No<br /><strong>Best for:</strong> Moderately active, normal-weight dogs<br /><strong>Nutrition breakdown:</strong> 26% protein, 15% fat, 3.5% fiber<br /><strong>Calorie count:</strong> 386 kcal/cup<bi-shortcode id=\"commerce-link\" class=\"mceNonEditable\" data-cardtype=\"button\" data-pid=\"60672b1a065f570018519c1d\" data-purchase-option=\"\">Classic Healthy Grains Real Beef and Brown Rice Recipe (25-lb. bag) (button)</bi-shortcode></aside><aside class=\"breakout-box headline-regular\"><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.chewy.com%2Fnatures-logic-canine-chicken-meal%2Fdp%2F244536\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Nature's Logic Canine Chicken Meal Feast (25-lb. bag)<br /></a><strong>Main protein sources: </strong>Chicken meal, chicken liver, eggs<br /><strong>Standout carbohydrates:</strong> Millet, pumpkin seed, kelp, almonds, carrots, apple, blueberries, cranberries<br /><strong>Healthy extras:</strong> Probiotics, digestive enzymes<br /><strong>Feeding trials:</strong> Yes<br /><strong>Best for:</strong> Active, normal-weight dogs<br /><strong>Nutrition breakdown:</strong> 36% protein, 15% fat, 5% fiber<br /><strong>Calorie count:</strong> 418 kcal/cup<bi-shortcode id=\"commerce-link\" class=\"mceNonEditable\" data-cardtype=\"button\" data-pid=\"60672c463d35010018fe0f8f\" data-purchase-option=\"\">Canine Chicken Meal Feast (25-lb. bag) (button)</bi-shortcode></aside>\n\tThe best adult wet dog food\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/606776f3856cd700198a2fb4?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Dog Food_Wet Food\" height=\"1250\" width=\"1667\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Chewy</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>Wet food is particularly appealing to dogs. Pet parents often like it for this reason, and because it has a long shelf life when unopened.&#160;</p><p>We selected wet foods that meet AAFCO complete and balanced standards, which are the same as those that apply to dry food. However, wet food generally contains more protein and fat and fewer carbohydrates, so be sure to talk to your veterinarian before switching your dog to a wet diet, especially if they have trouble digesting a lot of protein or fat.</p><p>Although the same standards apply to dry and wet food, it can be hard to compare their labels. Kibble has very little moisture, while canned food contains a lot of water. To understand a wet food label, you need to look at the percentages of protein, fat, and fiber on a \"dry matter basis.\" Read these <a href=\"https://vetnutrition.tufts.edu/2017/08/nutrient_converter/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">instructions</a> from the Cummings Veterinary Medical Center at Tufts University to calculate them yourself, call the food manufacturer, or ask your veterinarian for help. For the foods below, we contacted the manufacturer.</p><p>When shopping, be on the lookout for wet dog food that is 100% meat. More protein might seem like a good thing, but these foods are for supplemental feeding only. \"Dogs have evolved from wolves to become obligate omnivores,\" said Dodds. This means that they need more than just meat in their diet. Small amounts of meat-only wet foods can make tasty meal toppers for your dog's complete and balanced dry food.</p><h3>Our picks for adult wet dog food:</h3><aside class=\"breakout-box headline-regular\"><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.chewy.com%2Fgo-skin-coat-care-pollock-pate-dog%2Fdp%2F246647\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Go!

Although this information guided me in my product selection, our veterinary experts did not specifically endorse any of the products included in this guide. This makes sense since a veterinarian's goal is to find a food that best fits each individual dog, rather than making broad recommendations.&#160;</p><p>All the foods mentioned in this guide are complete and balanced according to the guidelines established by the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO), contain high-quality ingredients, and offer appropriate levels of protein, fat, and fiber for their respective categories.&#160;</p><p>I also consulted educational materials from the<a href=\"https://talkspetfood.aafco.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Association of American Feed Control Officials</a> (AAFCO) and the<a href=\"https://wsava.org/global-guidelines/global-nutrition-guidelines/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Global Nutrition Guidelines</a> published by the World Small Animal Veterinary Association (WSAVA).</p><h3>Here are the main attributes we looked for, in order of importance:</h3><p><strong>AAFCO nutritional adequacy statement:</strong> The most important benchmark of a healthy dog food is a statement on the label that says it meets the nutritional standards established by the AAFCO, demonstrating that the food is complete and balanced for the dog's life stage. All foods mentioned in this guide are AAFCO complete and balanced. Read more about those standards and definitions in the next slide.</p><p><strong>Guaranteed analysis:</strong> The guaranteed analysis lists the percentages of the most vital nutrients in the food: protein, fat, fiber, and moisture. Sometimes, other nutrients like glucosamine, chondroitin, and omega fatty acids are also listed in the guaranteed analysis. Foods selected in this guide contain moderate to high protein (AAFCO minimums are 22% for puppies and 18% for adults) and low to moderate fat (AAFCO minimums are 8.5% for puppies and 5.5% for adults).</p><p><strong>Ingredients list:</strong> The ingredients list can be tricky to navigate, especially when taking water content into account, but in general, you want to see clearly identified animal sources of protein at the top of the list. Whole meat is great, but it is heavier due to its moisture content. Once that water is removed, the meat content might not be as high as you think. Don't automatically write off meat meals. High-quality meat meals can be an excellent source of protein &#8212; the water has been removed, so they may provide more protein than whole meat. The ingredients lists of all the foods in this guide contain animal sources of protein at the top of the list.</p><p><strong>Healthy extras:</strong> According to Swanson, some foods contain extra ingredients intended to support healthy skin, coat, and joints. Some of these may include additional long-chain omega-3 fatty acids (EPA and DHA; usually supplied by marine-based oils or meals), omega-6 fatty acids (safflower oil, sunflower oil, corn oil, flaxseed, etc.), glucosamine, chondroitin, green-lipped mussels, and additional vitamins (vitamin A, biotin) and minerals (zinc, copper). Probiotics, prebiotics, and yeast fermentation products may also boost gut health.</p><p><strong>Calorie content:</strong> The calorie content of dog food is listed in kilocalories, or k/cals. When dogs consume too many calories, they are at risk for becoming overweight or obese. Less-active dogs need fewer calories and very active dogs like performance or working dogs need a food that is more calorie dense. For most dogs, being able to eat the largest volume of food while staying within the ideal daily calorie range will help them feel more satisfied. In general, such foods rated higher in our selection process. Check out this <a href=\"https://www.petnutritionalliance.org/dog.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">calorie calculator</a> to determine how many calories your dog needs. Your veterinarian can also evaluate if the amount you're feeding is appropriate.</p><p><strong>Feeding trials:</strong> It's great if a food has undergone feeding trials in addition to a laboratory analysis of the food's ingredients. If the nutritional adequacy statement on the label has language like \"Animal feeding tests using AAFCO procedures substantiate that [product] provides complete and balanced nutrition for [life stage]\" it means the food has been proven via feeding trials to be palatable, digestible, and able sustain pets over time.&#160;&#160;</p><p><strong>Expert formulations:</strong> Choose a pet food manufacturer that works closely with a veterinary nutritionist or other professional with a master's degree or PhD in nutrition, animal science, or a related field. Manufacturers may employ one or more full-time nutritionists, or hire one or more nutrition consultants. For this guide, we prioritized brands that have a dedicated nutrition expert on staff to align with <a href=\"https://wsava.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/The-Savvy-Dog-Owner-s-Guide-to-Nutrition-on-the-Internet.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">WSAVA recommendations</a>.</p><p><strong>Next-level ingredients:</strong> Seeing natural, organic, or human-grade ingredients on the label is nice, especially if you believe in the health benefits of organic foods. Wild-caught fish are as natural as you can get and, unlike farmed fish, are not treated with antibiotics or medications. Some foods use eggs and meat from cage-free chickens and turkeys, which is a bonus if you care about the welfare of the animals you &#8212; and your pets &#8212; eat. That said, ingredients in dog food need not be human-grade, organic, wild-caught, or cage-free to be healthy and nutritious for pets.</p>\n\tAAFCO standards\n\t\n\t<p>The<a href=\"https://talkspetfood.aafco.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Association of American Feed Control Officials</a> is a private nonprofit corporation that defines ingredients and establishes nutritional profiles for animal feed and pet food. AAFCO establishes model language for states and other governing bodies. It does not regulate, test, approve, or certify pet food. The US Food and Drug Administration, which is a voting member of AAFCO, regulates pet food labels at the federal level. States also regulate pet foods, and most have adopted the model pet food regulations established by AAFCO.</p><p>Dog foods that meet the nutritional standards established by AAFCO may use a statement on the label that says the food is complete and balanced for the dog's life stage according to the<a href=\"https://www.aafco.org/Portals/0/SiteContent/Regulatory/Committees/Pet-Food/Reports/Pet_Food_Report_2013_Midyear-Proposed_Revisions_to_AAFCO_Nutrient_Profiles.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> AAFCO Dog Food Nutrient Profile</a>. There are three life stages: 1) maintenance, for adult dogs more than 1 year old, 2) growth, for puppies less than 1 year old, and which also includes pregnant and lactating females, and 3) all life stages, which is any dog of any age.</p><p>Foods that do not display language asserting that they are complete and balanced as determined by AAFCO standards are labeled for supplemental or intermittent feeding only. Those foods should never be a dog's sole diet as they are not nutritionally adequate.</p><p>Foods can meet AAFCO standards in two ways:</p><ol><li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Guaranteed analysis: </strong>Nutrient profiles are determined through laboratory analysis of the food. Foods that meet AAFCO standards as per nutrient profiles will display language like \"formulated to meet the nutritional levels established by the AAFCO Dog Food Nutrient Profiles for [life stage].\" You can always contact the company to confirm the nutrient profile of the food also meets nutritional levels established by the AAFCO.</li><li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Feeding trials: </strong>Pet foods can also meet the standards through feeding trials, where the food is fed to animals under controlled conditions and the outcomes are monitored. Feeding trials are not perfect, and they are also very expensive, so not all companies perform them. However, it's nice to see them, though they should not replace nutrient profiles. If you see language like <strong>\"</strong>Animal feeding tests using AAFCO procedures substantiate that [product] provides complete and balanced nutrition for [life stage]\" it means the food has been proven via feeding trials to be palatable, digestible, and able sustain pets over time.</li></ol>\n\tHow to read a pet food label\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/606772dfa7d803001963e905?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Dog Food_Read Pet Food Label\" height=\"1142\" width=\"1667\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Alyssa Powell/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>Dog food packages feature attractive images and targeted descriptions intended to sell you on the quality and healthfulness of the food, but if you really want to know whether a dog food is high quality and a good choice for your dog, learn what to look for on the label.</p><p>A great place to start is <a href=\"https://wsava.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Nutrition-Label-USA-16_9.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this handy reference</a> from the WSAVA about interpreting food labels. The most important information to look for on a label is the AAFCO complete and balanced statement, the guaranteed analysis (crude protein, crude fat, crude fiber, and moisture), and the calorie content statement.</p><p>The ingredients list is also important, but it can be difficult for the average pet owner to know how well their dog will do on a diet just based off the ingredients.</p><p>\"Although many pet owners make their decision based largely on the ingredient panel, it is only one of many considerations,\" Swanson said. \"Without knowing the exact formula and percentage of each ingredient, it is not too useful. What is more important is that the dietary formula is complete and balanced.\"</p><p>Certain terms on pet food labels can be confusing and even misleading. \"Terms like 'natural' and 'organic' are very common in the industry today,\" Swanson said. \"While both terms were intended to highlight higher quality ingredients, they do not guarantee high quality.\" He explained that quality depends on both the raw ingredients and good manufacturing practices. \"Like other ingredients that do not carry these terms, they are highly variable due to differences in soil quality (plants), feed quality (animals), ingredient storage, ingredient handling, etc.,\" he said.</p><p>If you find reading pet food labels confusing, your veterinarian can talk to you about your dog's individual needs, help you choose an appropriate food, and advise how much to feed.</p>\n\tFAQs about dog food\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60675245a7d803001963e7db?format=jpeg\" alt=\"FAQs about dog food\" height=\"1124\" width=\"1500\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Westend61/Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<h3>What is the best food I can feed my dog?</h3><p>It's important to find a food your dog likes eating and thrives on, but this may involve a bit of trial and error. Individual dogs digest food differently. Some dogs do better with more protein, some need less. Some dogs can tolerate higher levels of fat; others need less. Dogs also handle amounts of fiber differently. Your veterinarian or a veterinary nutritionist can help you sort out what diet will work best for your dog.</p><p>\"Dogs are individuals,\" said veterinarian Carol Osborne, of the <a href=\"https://www.chagrinfallspetclinic.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Chagrin Falls Pet Clinic</a> in Chagrin Falls, Ohio. \"What works well for Dog A, might not work well for Dog B. If you want to know if a food is good for your pet, look at your pet. Your pet is a reflection of what he or she is eating.\"</p><p>Outward signs of good health include clear eyes and nose, ears that aren't smelly, and a coat that isn't dry, flakey, or shedding excessively. Your dog should not be vomiting or experiencing diarrhea. \"Soft stool is not normal,\" Osborne said. \"Bowel movements should be formed and homogenous. You should not be able to make out the pea, the piece of corn, the carrot. [Homogenous stool] means the food has all been digested.\"</p><h3>What is human-grade dog food?</h3><p>Pet foods that use the term \"human-grade\" must follow strict rules. The term may only be used if it applies to the finished food as a whole &#8212; not individual ingredients. Both the ingredients and finished product must be documented to be stored, handled, processed, and transported according to the current good manufacturing practices for human-edible foods, and the label must clearly state that the food is intended for dogs.</p><p>Swanson has tested a few human-grade pet foods in his lab over the years. \"While I don't have a strong preference to any one type or brand of diet, I can say that the human-grade foods I have had experience with are highly palatable, highly digestible, and resulted in a low volume of stool that allowed for easy clean up,\" he said.</p><h3>Is a raw diet good for my dog?</h3><p>A raw diet consists of uncooked meat, bones, and vegetables. Raw pet food poses dangers to both dogs and humans. Veterinarians told <a href=\"https://www.insider.com/raw-food-diet-for-dogs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Insider Reviews </a>that despite some reported benefits, there are too many risks for pets, including bacterial infections, nutritional deficiencies, and injuries from bones in the food. In addition, people who are immunocompromised, elderly people, and young children are at risk of bacterial infections if they live in a household where a dog is fed a raw diet.

However, we found it to feel slightly heavier than the S21 and expensive - especially since it did little to differentiate itself from the middle-of-the-road S21 Plus.

Its distinguishing feature is its large, folding display. The main screen is 7.6 inches with 2,208 x 1,768 resolution, while the cover screen is 6.2 inches with 2,260 x 816 resolution. </p><p>Samsung recently lowered the price on the Galaxy Z Fold 2 by $200 -from $1999.99 to $1799.99 - but it&#39;s still  pricey. Unlike its poorly reviewed predecessor, we found the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review#the-bottom-line\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Galaxy Z Fold 2</a> to be the most promising foldable device on the market. </p><p>We liked its vibrant, tablet-sized screen, its long battery life, and excellent speakers, but found its design to be a little awkward in phone-mode. It also lacked any waterproof rating, which we found disappointing for a phone this expensive. Ultimately, this is a device that is really only for those who are willing to pay a premium to try out the latest in foldable screen technology, but these discounts make it a little more palatable.</p><h2>Galaxy Z Flip 5G</h2><bi-shortcode id=\"commerce-link\" class=\"mceNonEditable\" data-cardtype=\"medium\" data-pid=\"605cdb8e065f57001851984c\" data-purchase-option=\"Best Buy\">Galazy Z Flip 5G (medium, Preferred: Best Buy)</bi-shortcode><aside class=\"breakout-box headline-regular\"><ul><li><strong>Typical price: </strong>$1,199.99</li><li><strong>Processor: </strong>Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 Plus</li><li><strong>Screen (resolution, refresh rate): </strong>6.7 inches, 1080 x 2636 pixels AMOLED main display and 1.1 inches, 112 x 300 pixels cover display</li><li><strong>Cameras:</strong> 10-MP front camera, 12-MP wide, 12-MP ultra-wide</li><li><strong><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-phones\">Check out our guide to the best phones</a></strong></li></ul></aside><p>The Galaxy Z Flip 5G is Samsung&#39;s attempt at modernizing the classic flip phone.

The Flip 5G launched in August at $1,450, but is now only available in a 256GB model that is regularly priced at $1,199.99. </p><p>We found the non-5G version of <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/samsung-new-galaxy-z-flip-phone-best-features-price-2020-2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the Galaxy Z Flip</a> to bring something new to the smartphone experience, while also functioning well enough as a standard smartphone. However, we thought the Flip&#39;s cover screen was a little too thin and awkward when it was closed, and wished it was waterproof. The price of Flip makes it, like the Galaxy Fold 2, a niche item for those wanting a new - but not yet perfected - flexible smartphone.</p><h2><strong>Galaxy A71 5G</strong></h2><bi-shortcode id=\"commerce-link\" class=\"mceNonEditable\" data-cardtype=\"medium\" data-pid=\"605e03c5065f5700185198c7\" data-purchase-option=\"Best Buy\">Galaxy A71 5G (medium, Preferred: Best Buy)</bi-shortcode><aside class=\"breakout-box headline-regular\"><ul><li><strong>Typical price: </strong>$599.99</li><li><strong>Processor: </strong>Qualcomm Snapdragon 765</li><li><strong>Screen (resolution, refresh rate): </strong>6.7-inch OLED (2400x1080), 60Hz</li><li><strong>Cameras:</strong> 32-MP,  64-MP main, 12-MP ultrawide, 5-MP macro, 5-MP depth</li><li><strong><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-wireless-earbuds\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Check out our guide to the best true wireless earbuds in 2021</a></strong></li></ul></aside><p>The Galaxy A71 5G was released in June of 2020 as a lower-priced option for those looking to get a 5G phone without all of the more expensive features.

one under the Pacific Ocean, the other under Africa -has baffled geologists for four decades. <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-018-0225-2\">Some experts have suggested</a> that the massive rocks are fragments of tectonic plates that got trapped under their counterparts.</p><p>But according to <a href=\"https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2021/pdf/1980.pdf\">new research</a>, their origin may be otherworldly.</p><p>A group of scientists from Arizona State University suggested the blobs are remnants of a &#34;Mars-sized planetary embryo&#34; named Theia, which struck Earth in its infancy 4.5 billion years ago. The impact is thought to have turned Earth&#39;s surface into a sea of fiery magma and caused it to shoot out enough planetary debris to create the moon. </p><p>Qian Yuan, the lead researcher behind the findings, studies geodynamics at ASU. He thinks that following the ancient collision, parts of Theia may have sunk and gotten preserved deep in our planet&#39;s mantle - the semisolid layer between Earth&#39;s crust and core, he said.</p><p>Those pieces are &#34;millions of times larger than Mount Everest in terms of volume,&#34; Yuan told Insider. </p><h2>Dense areas up to 621 miles in height</h2><p>Geologists discovered these chunks - their technical name is large low-shear-velocity provinces - by sending seismic waves down into the planet. Under both Africa and the Pacific Ocean, the speed of these seismic waves slowed to a crawl, suggesting an area of rock denser than its surroundings. The animation below, based on a <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:LLSVP.gif\">2016 analysis</a>, shows the size of these areas.</p><div class=\"insider-raw-embed\"><a title=\"Sanne.cottaar, CC BY-SA 4.0 <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0>, via Wikimedia Commonsommons\" href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:LLSVP.gif\"><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/29/LLSVP.gif?format=jpeg\" alt=\"LLSVP\" height=\"\" width=\"512\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\"></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></a></div><p>According to Yuan, these blobs are between 1.5 and 3.5% more dense than the rest of Earth&#39;s mantle, and hotter.</p><p>If the planet Theia was rich in iron and highly dense, Yuan&#39;s models showed, any pieces of it that broke off when it hit Earth would have sunk deep into our planet&#39;s mantle. There, they could have accumulated undisturbed, rather than getting mixed into the rest of the mantle.</p><p>It&#39;s also possible denser <a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/93JB03403\">chunks of Earth&#39;s crust</a> sank into the mantle and joined them, contributing to the blobs&#39; growth over time, Yuan said. </p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/57b752c4db5ce91c008b7dc2?format=jpeg\" alt=\"earth core crust mantle layers shutterstock\" height=\"1250\" width=\"2000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>An illustration of Earth&#39;s layers.

Their deepest parts are 1,800 miles under our feet, in the part of the mantle closest to Earth&#39;s outer core. They&#39;re 621 miles (1,000 kilometers) high and two to three times wider than they are tall. </p><p>But scientists have figured out that plumes of hot rock and magma from some Icelandic and Samoan volcanoes <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nature11141\">came from these blobs</a>. By analyzing this magma&#39;s makeup, researchers can glean insight into the composition of these mysterious buried chunks. According to a <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009281919300509\">2019 study</a>, some elements in the volcanic plumes date back to about 4.5 billion years ago - when Theia supposedly hit Earth.</p><h2>When planets collide</h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f93902bf21803001222bc35?format=jpeg\" alt=\"the moon surface\" height=\"900\" width=\"1600\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The moon, as viewed by NASA&#39;s Mariner 10 in 1973.\n<p class=\"copyright\"><a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/the-moon-is-rusting-and-researchers-want-to-know-why\" target=\"_blank\">NASA/JPL/Northwestern University</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>The idea that the impact between a tiny planet and Earth helped form the moon has been around for <a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2017JE005333#jgre20813-bib-0007\">more than 45 years</a>. But a problem with that hypothesis is that scientists haven&#39;t found any evidence of Theia&#39;s existence.</p><p><a href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/351/6272/493\">A 2016 study</a> suggested that&#39;s because Earth&#39;s and Theia&#39;s cores fused together. Another idea, <a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2017JE005333\">put forward in 2018,</a> posits that when the planets collided, both were &#34;almost completely vaporized,&#34; Yuan said. According to that thinking, Earth became a rapidly spinning mass of molten and vaporized rock called a synestia, then <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/02/180228103238.htm\">collapsed back into a molten planet</a>. Part of that spinning mass became the moon, and Theia was no more.</p><p>A third theory - called the &#34;hit-and-run,&#34; according to Yuan - is that Theia just glanced off Earth, and chunks of one planet, or pieces from both, combined to form the moon. But the moon&#39;s composition matches Earth&#39;s almost exactly, which suggests it contains very little of Theia.</p><p>Yuan&#39;s new findings, which will soon be published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, may finally offer proof that Theia was in our solar system billions of years ago.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/pieces-planet-theia-buried-in-earth-mantle-2021-4'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=mbOowFFEP3U:uYi-FWOSi1g:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=mbOowFFEP3U:uYi-FWOSi1g:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=mbOowFFEP3U:uYi-FWOSi1g:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=mbOowFFEP3U:uYi-FWOSi1g:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=mbOowFFEP3U:uYi-FWOSi1g:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=mbOowFFEP3U:uYi-FWOSi1g:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=mbOowFFEP3U:uYi-FWOSi1g:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=mbOowFFEP3U:uYi-FWOSi1g:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/mbOowFFEP3U\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 02 Apr 2021 18:32:01 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/606241ac67187800184ad2db?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"83a1a55d2961c89f9b2b52821ea40026","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn63@2020_3/2021/04/03/04-49-40-265_7d9feff52df9b0de.webp","destWidth":3000,"destHeight":2249,"sourceBytes":137978,"destBytes":137978,"author":"awoodward@insider.com (Aylin Woodward)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/6062419ac9d73b00186e90c1?format=jpeg":null,"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/29/LLSVP.gif?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn80@2020_3/2021/04/03/04-49-57-213_48563141a241fc18.webp","https://i.insider.com/57b752c4db5ce91c008b7dc2?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn48@2020_5/2021/04/03/04-49-47-022_7946741c96d13948.webp","https://i.insider.com/5f93902bf21803001222bc35?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn55@2020_1/2021/04/03/04-49-46-108_1541436044903b08.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn57@2020_1/2021/04/03/04-49-56-622_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=mbOowFFEP3U:uYi-FWOSi1g:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn16@2020_5/2021/04/03/04-49-56-266_a2c0090a9c0cc6c5.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=mbOowFFEP3U:uYi-FWOSi1g:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn87@2020_2/2021/04/03/04-49-44-129_a28b095d94d448d6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn52@2020_6/2021/04/03/04-49-50-912_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=mbOowFFEP3U:uYi-FWOSi1g:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn46@2020_1/2021/04/03/04-49-56-488_ef0664d68762896a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/mbOowFFEP3U":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn35@2020_2/2021/04/03/04-49-58-691_8eaecb2e0f8193d1.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617425373916},{"createdTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:33","updatedTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:33","title":"19 Stanford courses you can take for free online, including a flexible class on designing your dream career","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/stanford-university-free-online-courses","description":"<p class=\"financial-disclaimer\"><i>If you buy through our links, we may earn money from affiliate partners. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.insider-inc.com/commerce-on-insider-inc/\">Learn more.</a></i></p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60677958856cd700198a2fc5?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Standford University 4x3\" height=\"1250\" width=\"1667\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Standford;

In a video from March of last year, Wade told users that the approximately 130 employees of the company were working from home. </p><p>&#34;It should be physical distancing, not social distancing, that is important,&#34; he said. He encouraged people using the app to use the time &#34;to form genuine connections to online courtships,&#34; and said that he was using the app more than usual.

As duvets and duvet covers are a bit new on the bedding scene in the United States, there's still some confusion over exactly what they are, and how they differ from a comforter.</p><ul><li><strong>What is a duvet?&#160;</strong>A duvet (pronounce it \"due-vay;\" the word comes from the Old French for \"down\") is a type of quilt that is typically solid white and stuffed with feathers, down, or a down alternative. You'll sometimes find duvets referred to as \"down comforters\" in the United States. Duvets are generally warm and snug, although some are lightweight for use in the summertime.</li><li><strong>Why does it need a cover?&#160;</strong>A duvet cover is a fabric \"envelope\" that is used to cover and protect a duvet, in the same way a pillowcase covers and protects a bed pillow. In Europe, it's unusual to use a top sheet; the duvet cover serves the same purpose and is removed for washing along with the fitted sheet. The duvet cover adds color and style to the bedroom, as well. One edge of the duvet cover closes with ties, buttons, or a zipper so you can insert or remove the duvet when it's time to wash the cover.</li><li><strong>How is it different from a comforter?&#160;</strong>Comforters are usually colored or patterned, not solid white, so they don't require a cover to add style. And because comforters are normally used over a top sheet, they don't require an additional layer of fabric for protection from skin oil, sweat, and other nighttime body detritus, either. Comforters are most often stuffed with synthetic fill, although you can also find down-filled comforters.&#160;</li></ul><h3>How to choose a duvet cover</h3><p>For the most part, the right duvet cover is the one you like best. There are nearly endless colors and patterns available, so choose whatever complements your bedroom's d&#233;cor and brings a smile to your face. Aside from style, there are just a few things to know about buying a duvet cover:</p><ul><li><strong>Size:&#160;</strong>Duvet covers are sized the same as regular bedding, so choose the size that matches your duvet; don't go larger or smaller.&#160;You'll find many duvet covers sold with matching shams. That makes it easy to coordinate your bed's good looks.</li><li><strong>Materials:&#160;</strong>Duvet covers are made from the same fabrics as bed sheets. Many are cotton, and as with cotton sheets, the softest, highest quality comes from Egyptian, Supima, or Pima cotton. But don't assume you need a duvet cover with the highest thread-count: 250 to 500 is generally sufficient. While cotton is very popular, you'll also find microfiber and other synthetics, flannel, and jersey duvet covers.</li><li><strong>Care:&#160;</strong>The easier the care, the more often you'll be willing to wash your bedding, so look for duvet covers that safely machine-wash and dry.</li></ul>\n\tHow to put a duvet cover on your duvet\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5bc609cbb09cab135c28ef13?format=jpeg\" alt=\"best duvet covers 2021 how to put duvet cover on\" height=\"675\" width=\"900\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Brooklinen</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>The frustration over putting a duvet inside its cover is enough to drive many people back to comforters. But don't give up. Here's how to do it without breaking a sweat or pulling out your hair.</p><ol><li>Start by turning your duvet cover inside out, and then spreading it across your mattress with its opening at the foot of the bed.</li><li>Lay your duvet on top of its cover.</li><li>If your duvet and duvet cover have inner ties, fasten them now. If not, you can use safety pins to fasten the corners of the cover to the duvet, or simply do without.</li><li>Roll the duvet and its cover together like a burrito, starting from the head of your bed. It's easiest if you have a partner, but if not, switch from side to side as you work.</li><li>When your \"burrito\" is rolled, fold the duvet cover opening back around the bedding bundle.</li><li>Close your duvet cover with its zipper, buttons, or ties.</li><li>Unroll your \"burrito\" towards the top of the bed.</li><li>Fluff as necessary, and voila! Your duvet is back in its cover.&#160;</li></ol>\n\tCheck out our other great bedding guides\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5b90257d04f162f82c8b4d27?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Crane &#38;

pair of gardening gloves. By protecting your hands from soil, debris, thorns, and chemicals, they help prevent blisters, scrapes, and other injuries. </p><p>The type of gloves you&#39;ll need depends on the gardening task. &#34;Standard cotton garden gloves are a good option for planting annuals and potted plants,&#34; said Karen Musgrave, marketing coordinator at <a href=\"https://hicksnurseries.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hicks Nurseries</a>, the largest garden center on Long Island, New York. &#34;Rose growers should choose leather gloves that are long, reaching your elbow to provide protection from thorns. For planting trees and shrubs, choose heavy-duty gloves with reinforced fingertips.&#34; </p><p>Comfort, fit, and breathability are also important. The best gardening gloves keep your hands cool and dry and let your fingers move nimbly to pull weeds, plant flowers and shrubs, and even take the occasional phone or water break. &#34;It&#39;s important to have a snug fit so that it gives you the dexterity that you need and prevents minor injury when you want to get a little more aggressive in the soil when trimming,&#34; said Vanessa Dawson, founder of plant care startup <a href=\"https://growarber.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Arber</a>. </p><p>After consulting gardening experts and conducting our own in-depth research, we found the best gardening gloves for various budgets and uses.

We combined that information with our own research to choose a few glove options per category.&#160;</p><p>Next, we'll be calling in samples of these contenders and evaluating them for comfort, fit, functionality, and durability.&#160;</p>\n\tFAQs\n\t\n\t<h3>What to know before you shop&#160;</h3><p>How you plan to spend time in your garden and backyard will help determine the style and material of your ideal gardening gloves. Cloth and nitrile gloves will do just fine for light gardening, but for anything involving heavy or thorny objects, you should use leather gloves. It's likely you'll have several pairs of gloves on hand, depending on your task of the moment.&#160;</p><p>Fit is another important factor. Consult provided sizing charts to figure out which size to buy, and look for fitted wrist cuffs. If the glove is too small or large, your hand will feel uncomfortable and be more prone to injuries. Incorrect sizing can also allow soil or other debris to fall into the glove.</p><hr /><h3>Pros and cons of nitrile, cotton, and leather</h3><p>\"Nitrile [a synthetic rubber] gloves are lighter, breathable and less expensive than leather gloves. Leather gloves provide the best protection and often last the longest. Cotton gloves are good for smaller projects and are often the least expensive,\" said Musgrave.</p><hr /><h3>How to wash and care for your gardening gloves&#160;</h3><p>\"In general, keep them dry when not in use and out of the sun as that cracks the rubber. Use saddle soap on the leather ones,\" said Dawson. Depending on the material, some gloves may be machine-washable.&#160;</p><p>Keep in mind that most gloves won't and aren't meant to last a lifetime, especially with regular use. It's good to keep a few different pairs on hand to rotate through. Luckily, most gardening gloves are affordable.&#160;</p>\n\tCheck out more gardening and backyard guides\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/603934b105ddb100195f670f?format=jpeg\"

Kristi Noem was one of them, but she offered an unorthodox definition of physical infrastructure: one that doesn&#39;t include pipes.</p><p>In an <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7SBn_FLDZ4&t=122s122s\">interview</a> on Thursday, Noem discussed the president&#39;s infrastructure bill with Fox News&#39; Sean Hannity, and as the interview progressed, she elaborated on her definition of infrastructure, saying housing doesn&#39;t qualify either. </p><p>&#34;I was shocked by how much doesn&#39;t go into infrastructure,&#34; Noem said. &#34;It goes into research and development, it goes into housing and pipes and different initiatives, green energy, and it&#39;s not really an honest conversation that we&#39;re having about what this proposal is.&#34;</p><p>Shortly after the interview aired, critics on Twitter highlighted the &#34;pipes&#34; comment in particular, and left-leaning media figures were especially critical. For instance, MSNBC host Mehdi Hasan said Noem had &#34;revealed she doesn&#39;t know what infrastructure is.&#34;</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet blockquote\" data-lang=\"en\" data-cards=\"\" data-conversation=\"\">-Mehdi Hasan  (@mehdirhasan) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mims/statuses/1377475821204561921?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 1, 2021</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script><p> </p><p>While Noem&#39;s criticism of the bill was likely the most striking on the Republican side, her party has been unified in trying to label the bill as a Democratic &#34;Trojan Horse,&#34; sneaking non-infrastructure things into an infrastructure plan.</p><p>In a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/mitch-mcconnell-slams-bidens-2-trillion-infrastructure-plan-missed-opportunity-2021-4\">statement on Wednesday</a>, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell made the &#34;Trojan Horse&#34; comparison and said that while Biden could have drafted a &#34;serious, targeted infrastructure plan&#34; that could have received bipartisan support, &#34;the latest liberal wish-list the White House has decided to label &#39;infrastructure&#39; is a major missed opportunity by this Administration.&#34; The next day, McConnell said the the bill will <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/mcconnell-says-gop-wont-support-infrastructure-plan-2021-4\">not get any Republican support</a>, at least not in the Senate. </p><p>Both McConnell and <a href=\"https://www.republicanleader.gov/bidenomics/\">House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy</a> have trotted out a key statistic to make this point: 6%, as in, less than 6% of Biden&#39;s proposal is dedicated to roads and bridges.</p><p>The truth is that things in the plan outside of that 6% are plausibly related to infrastructure, just not a 20th-century understanding of it. McConnell&#39;s statement highlights that Biden &#34;would spend more money just on electric cars than on America&#39;s roads, bridges, ports, airports, and waterways combined.&#34; </p><p>But the <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/03/31/fact-sheet-the-american-jobs-plan/\">White House fact sheet</a> released on Wednesday ahead of Biden&#39;s unveiling of the plan makes the case that it&#39;s time to rethink infrastructure. It notes that the 1936 Rural Electrification Act involved a federal investment in bringing electricity to nearly every home in the US, and it&#39;s time to do the same for broadband internet and electric vehicles. Republicans are saying they don&#39;t want to have that rethink.</p><p>Some Republican voters seem open to it, more than half of them in some cases. Insider&#39;s Juliana Kaplan <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/what-do-republican-voters-think-of-bidens-infrastructure-proposals-poll-2021-4\">reported</a> on Friday that Republicans and Democrats&#39; definitions of infrastructure may be different in large part because of <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/04/01/kristi-noem-hannity-biden-infrastructure-plan/\">regional political polarization</a>, but that even so, a Morning Consult/Politico <a href=\"https://assets.morningconsult.com/wp-uploads/2021/03/31082502/2103166_crosstabs_POLITICO_RVs_v1_AUTO.pdf\">poll</a> shows significant levels of support among Republican voters for funding low-income housing, among other things. </p><p>But regardless of the consistency of Republican rhetoric on Biden&#39;s infrastructure plan, the comments serve to illustrate the likely legislative outcome: zero Republican votes for it. This multitrillion-dollar plan may end up the same as Biden&#39;s <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/stimulus-biden-signs-trillion-covid-relief-package-checks-direct-payments-2021-3\">$1.9 trillion stimulus</a>, which didn&#39;t get a single vote in the House or the Senate.</p><p>Noem&#39;s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/kristi-noem-infrastructure-pipes-south-dakota-governor-republicans-fox-news-2021-4'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=8Uukhe8RXv0:aL50gSiavbI:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=8Uukhe8RXv0:aL50gSiavbI:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=8Uukhe8RXv0:aL50gSiavbI:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=8Uukhe8RXv0:aL50gSiavbI:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=8Uukhe8RXv0:aL50gSiavbI:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=8Uukhe8RXv0:aL50gSiavbI:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=8Uukhe8RXv0:aL50gSiavbI:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=8Uukhe8RXv0:aL50gSiavbI:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/8Uukhe8RXv0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 02 Apr 2021 20:24:03 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/60676d4c856cd700198a2f72?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"975280aaf14c81e7e17c670eb9ee0a8f","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn51@2020_4/2021/04/03/04-49-37-871_c9d41083917d2246.webp","destWidth":3573,"destHeight":2680,"sourceBytes":280894,"destBytes":280894,"author":"asheffey@businessinsider.com (Ayelet Sheffey)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/60676d4c856cd700198a2f72?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn51@2020_4/2021/04/03/04-49-37-871_c9d41083917d2246.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn57@2020_1/2021/04/03/04-49-56-622_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=8Uukhe8RXv0:aL50gSiavbI:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn3@2020_3/2021/04/03/04-49-48-654_e32c59cfa6903a9c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=8Uukhe8RXv0:aL50gSiavbI:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn89@2020_4/2021/04/03/04-49-58-468_02beb7f605d2ba90.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn52@2020_6/2021/04/03/04-49-50-912_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=8Uukhe8RXv0:aL50gSiavbI:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn40@2020_2/2021/04/03/04-49-47-968_7f57c32fccb142f9.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/8Uukhe8RXv0":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn93@2020_2/2021/04/03/04-49-56-647_35dcf449b9346e3b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617425373779},{"createdTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:33","updatedTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:33","title":"How to watch 'The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,' the latest Marvel show to hit Disney Plus","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-watch-the-falcon-and-the-winter-soldier","description":"<p class=\"financial-disclaimer\"><i>If you buy through our links, we may earn money from affiliate partners. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.insider-inc.com/commerce-on-insider-inc/\">Learn more.</a></i></p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60208192cca90200129b6e70?format=jpeg\" alt=\"falcon and the winter soldier\" height=\"2000\" width=\"3000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Marvel Studios</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>&#34;The Falcon and the Winter Soldier&#34;

Republicans say that&#39;s a far cry from rebuilding roads and bridges.</p><p>&#34;Our nation could use a serious, targeted infrastructure plan. There would be bipartisan support for a smart proposal,&#34; Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/mitch-mcconnell-slams-bidens-2-trillion-infrastructure-plan-missed-opportunity-2021-4\">said on Wednesday</a>. &#34;Unfortunately, the latest liberal wish-list the White House has decided to label &#39;infrastructure&#39; is a major missed opportunity by this Administration.&#34;</p><p>The next day, McConnell indicated that the current infrastructure package likely <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/mcconnell-says-gop-wont-support-infrastructure-plan-2021-4\">won&#39;t get any GOP votes</a>, at least in the Senate. His rhetoric around a sweeping view of infrastructure has been echoed by fellow conservatives like Kristi Noem, the governor of South Dakota, who <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/kristi-noem-infrastructure-fox-news_n_60657319c5b63387414841ef\">said in a Fox News interview</a> that the package went into things like pipes, housing, and research - none of which she considers infrastructure.</p><p>As <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/04/01/kristi-noem-hannity-biden-infrastructure-plan/\">The Washington Post&#39;s Greg Sargent</a> notes in an opinion column, placing research and development outside of the scope of infrastructure is a departure from previous GOP thinking. Sargent also notes that with Republicans and Democrats increasingly segregated by region, different definitions of infrastructure are taking on a regional divide as well. Biden&#39;s infrastructure proposals have a decidedly more urban focus, and of course, Democrats tend to live in cities and <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/idea-of-american-suburbs-false-revealed-election-biden-trump-2020-11\">dense suburbs</a>. </p><p>But while Republican politicians have made clear how they&#39;d like to define infrastructure, what do actual Republican voters think?</p><h2>What the polling shows about Republican voters&#39; support for Biden&#39;s infrastructure proposal</h2><p>A <a href=\"https://assets.morningconsult.com/wp-uploads/2021/03/31082502/2103166_crosstabs_POLITICO_RVs_v1_AUTO.pdf\">Morning Consult/Politico poll</a> delved into how 2,043 respondents felt about different prospective aspects of the two-pronged infrastructure package, asking: &#34;To what extent do you support or oppose funding for the following being included in the infrastructure plan being developed by the Biden administration?&#34;</p><p>The poll found more than half of Republican voters either strongly or somewhat support funding for increased housing-options for low-income Americans (53%), and almost half do for an extension of the expanded child tax credit (49%). A significant minority do for the widespread availability of electric-vehicle charging stations (40%) and free community college (38%), while research on climate change and universal pre-K accrued the support of more than a third (37% and 36%, respectively).</p><p>The proposals that got more tepid support were the extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies (34%) and conversion of transportation sector to run on electric power (28%). Bringing up the rear of the polling were reduced tuition at historically Black colleges and universities (24%) and free tuition at historically Black colleges and universities (14%).</p><p>Here&#39;s

an ongoing collaboration with the nonprofit Rethink Food to feed food-insecure districts in Brooklyn and the Bronx.</p><p>Rethink Food is a New York-based non-profit that was co-founded by Eleven Madison Park&#39;s co-owner and Michelin-starred chef Daniel Humm.</p><p>&#34;The Eleven Madison Truck offers a mobile extension of the restaurant&#39;s commissary kitchen, distributing meals made with the same produce and ingredients utilized at the restaurant on-site in an effort to reduce food insecurity in the communities that need it most,&#34; the restaurant said.</p><p>The truck will offer meals that the restaurant has been providing to first responders and soup kitchens during the pandemic. These meals include jerk chicken with roasted vegetables and grain bowls, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-02/eleven-madison-park-starts-food-truck-ahead-of-nyc-reopening?srnd=premium&sref=BWbpWjRmWjRm\">Bloomberg first reported</a> on Friday.</p><p>&#34;We had been brainstorming different ways to make the restaurant part of the community and get staff engaged beyond making meals and pushing them out of the door, and then Daniel called me and was, like, &#39;Let&#39;s do a food truck,&#34; co-founder and chief executive officer of Rethink Matt Jozwiak <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-02/eleven-madison-park-starts-food-truck-ahead-of-nyc-reopening?srnd=premium&sref=BWbpWjRmWjRm\">told Bloomberg.</a></p><p>Eleven Madison Park will prepare the meals from its leftover ingredients and donated products.

For every <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/eleven-madison-park-to-go-meal-mean-kit-roast-chicken-2020-10\">$275 home-dinner meal kit</a> bought from the fine-dining restaurant, the Eleven Madison Truck will offer 10 free meals, according to the statement.</p><p>More donations will go to the truck once the restaurant reopens for indoor dining later in 2021, Eleven Madison Park added.</p><p>The restaurant closed its doors in March 2020 when the pandemic hit the country and COVID-19 cases surged. In response to the pandemic, <a href=\"https://stories.zagat.com/posts/matt-jozwiak-and-daniel-humm-take-the-fight-against-hunger-nationwide\">Jozwiak agreed with Humm </a>to use Eleven Madison Park&#39;s kitchen as a commissary kitchen with the goal to prepare 250,000 meals throughout COVID-19. </p><p>Jozwiak, who is also a former cook at the restaurant, previously said in a <a

Jews observing Passover cut out chametz, or any grain-based products that are capable of leavening. Some Jews also cut out kitniyot, which includes foods like rice, beans, peanuts, and corn. Regular bottles of Coke contain high-fructose corn syrup which is not kosher for Passover. Today, <a href=\"https://www.insider.com/why-do-coke-bottles-have-yellow-caps-2017-4\">bottles of Coca-Cola that are kosher for Passover have yellow caps</a> instead of the traditional red ones. In addition to the yellow cap, the bottle has a Passover certification symbol.</p><p>The Hechsher, or the Ⓤ marking on many common food items, is a signifier that <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/kosher-symbol-appears-nearly-half-food-jewish-shopping-grocery-store-2017-4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the food is certified kosher</a>. Kosher for Passover items require an additional Passover hechsher. There are various symbols that appear on food packaging. The symbols differ depending on which kosher organization has certified the food and the contents of the food. The small letters next to kosher symbols signify if the food is dairy, meat, pareve (neither dairy nor meat), or kosher for Passover. You can find the Ⓤ on Oreos, Coca-Cola, and many other items people purchase regularly.</p><p><em>EDITOR&#39;S NOTE: This video was originally published in April 2017.</em></p><p> </p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/kosher-passover-coca-cola-bottles-yellow-cap-bottle-soda-retail-food-drink-jewish-jews-2017-4'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=CH8wzGOjhTA:5oY5Spwx7DA:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=CH8wzGOjhTA:5oY5Spwx7DA:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=CH8wzGOjhTA:5oY5Spwx7DA:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=CH8wzGOjhTA:5oY5Spwx7DA:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=CH8wzGOjhTA:5oY5Spwx7DA:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=CH8wzGOjhTA:5oY5Spwx7DA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=CH8wzGOjhTA:5oY5Spwx7DA:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=CH8wzGOjhTA:5oY5Spwx7DA:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/CH8wzGOjhTA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 02 Apr 2021 19:35:46 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/58f1367bc75d4a05018b46ce?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"06d786e59db36e67b341a3a440966eea","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn3@2020_4/2021/04/03/04-49-40-653_12fb3a8a9eebf7b7.webp","destWidth":1440,"destHeight":1080,"sourceBytes":45122,"destBytes":45122,"author":"efierberg@businessinsider.com (Emma Fierberg)","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn57@2020_1/2021/04/03/04-49-56-622_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=CH8wzGOjhTA:5oY5Spwx7DA:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn3@2020_4/2021/04/03/04-49-42-795_64b92e5d519d511c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=CH8wzGOjhTA:5oY5Spwx7DA:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn50@2020_4/2021/04/03/04-49-57-025_2b3352502df98639.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn52@2020_6/2021/04/03/04-49-50-912_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=CH8wzGOjhTA:5oY5Spwx7DA:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn31@2020_4/2021/04/03/04-49-43-133_662bb7fbb51cda02.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/CH8wzGOjhTA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn59@2020_3/2021/04/03/04-49-50-930_bc5c68ff08d2e16b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617425373891},{"createdTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:33","updatedTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:33","title":"Biden says he is 'heartbroken' and orders flags at the White House to be flown at half-staff in response to Capitol Police officer death","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/biden-white-house-flags-half-staff-capitol-police-officer-death-2021-4","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/605d989a106eb50019d05bd7?format=jpeg\" alt=\"joe biden\" height=\"2010\" width=\"4020\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>President Joe Biden.\n<p class=\"copyright\">AP</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>Biden said he was &#34;heartbroken&#34; after a Capitol attack left one Capitol Police officer dead.</li>\n<li>A car rammed into a barricade at the Capitol, injuring two officers - one of whom is hospitalized.</li>\n<li>Biden ordered the flags at the White House to be flown at half-staff to honor the officer.</li>\n<li id=\"recirc\"><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">See more stories on Insider&#39;s business page</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>President Joe Biden ordered flags at the White House to be flown at half-staff in response to the death of a Capitol Police officer after <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/us-capitol-is-on-lockdown-over-an-external-security-threat-2021-4\">a car rammed into a barricade outside the Capitol</a> on Friday afternoon.</p><p>Earlier Friday, the Capitol went on lockdown after a vehicle rammed into an outside barricade and injured two officers.

On top of that, we&#39;ve granted real estate development such favorable tax treatment that it is nearly immune from taxation. Even Donald Trump, arguably the worst business person in US history, made money in real estate development, despite the serial failure of the underlying business. As one tax law expert <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/30/business/trump-taxes-real-estate.html?referringSource=articleShare\">put it</a>, the real estate industry &#34;thinks of the tax code as a basket of goodies to feast on rather than a financial obligation of doing business.&#34; Imagine buying stock and being able to depreciate it as it increased in value.</p><p>Thanks to ever-growing demand and favorable tax treatment, real estate once minted more billionaires than tech. In 2019, 223 people on the <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/willyakowicz/2019/03/09/how-the-worlds-billionaires-got-so-rich/#3d4f22966ae6\">Forbes billionaire list</a> owed their wealth to real estate, compared to 214 from tech.</p><p>Then … COVID.</p><p>The third great conveyance of the modern economy (the first two being globalization and digitization) is in full swing: Dispersion, the process of value leapfrogging traditional points of distribution. Three sectors stand to register the greatest reallocation of stakeholder value (i.e., shit-kicking): healthcare, commercial real estate, and education as consumers leapfrog hospitals, HQ, and campuses.</p><p>Dispersion is enabled by both globalization and digitization. High-bandwidth communications link billions of people, and robust mobile devices render that network continuous. Now, blockchain technology is enabling the network to store value (bitcoin) and act on it (etherium). This will bring further disruption to industries low on IQ and heavy on EQ, such as insurance/asset management/central banking (wrapping my head around this is my biggest challenge for 2021).</p><p>The point is, the pandemic has accelerated all of these trends. A year-plus of forced acceptance of remote services in every sector has carved permanent change into our behavior. And, few sectors have seen a more radical transformation than office work.</p><h2>Valuation</h2><p>Any discussion of valuation must be set against the backdrop of a firm&#39;s valuation. Gannett Co., Inc. faces structural challenges, but at a $2.5 billion enterprise value (0.7x revenue), Gannett is undervalued. Tesla is a great product and company, but at $637 billion (20x revenue), it is overvalued (send in the clowns/trolls). Disclosure: I am a shareholder in Gannett and consistently wrong re: Tesla.</p><p>Anyway, the office real estate in the US alone is a $2.5 trillion asset class, and it is going to leak the GDP of Switzerland to residential over the next decade. However, it&#39;s not as easy as going short all office firms and long all residential. The fire that will rage within the office sector will raise seeds of dormancy - and create unexpected winners. One pyrophile plant that emerges from the fire may be WeWork. I&#39;m especially proud of that last sentence.</p><h2>Why We (might) Work</h2><p>The wholesale abandonment of office space has been among the most striking fallouts of the pandemic, and it will have profound effects on the way we live and work, long after the virus has been tamed. In New York, new office space is coming on the market 59% leased, down from 74% pre-COVID. San Francisco went from its lowest-ever office vacancy rate to its highest in the same year, and office rents are set to decline by 15%. The worst may be yet to come. Analysts predict that commercial<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/3657404-struggles-ahead-for-us-office-sector-vacancy-rates-seen-rising-in-2021\"> vacancy</a> rates will rise from 17.1% in 2020 to 19.4% in 2021, besting the previous high of 17.6% in 2010. And, as <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2020-commercial-real-estate/?sref=AhQQoPzF\">$430 billion</a> in commercial and multifamily real estate debt matures in 2021, lenders will be forced to reconcile the effect of the pandemic on their investments.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/6067579c856cd700198a2ec0?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Scott Galloway.\" height=\"963\" width=\"1560\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\"><a href=\"https://www.profgalloway.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Scott Galloway</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/606757df856cd700198a2ec2?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Scott Galloway\" height=\"867\" width=\"1560\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\"><a href=\"https://www.profgalloway.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Scott Galloway</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>These changes will endure. Twitter, Facebook, and Slack have all announced the move to a predominantly remote workforce. Pinterest recently paid $90 million to terminate its HQ lease in San Francisco. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/08/12/rei-seattle-headquarters-commercial-real-estate/\">REI</a> sold its new headquarters before even moving in, and <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/10/1-year-into-covid-employers-rethink-offices-and-function-matters-most.html\">CVS</a> plans to cut 30% of its office space. At my New York-based education startup, Section4, we asked employees if they wanted to come back to work after the pandemic; overwhelmingly, they wanted to stay home. We paid $1 million to terminate our SoHo office lease. After decades of promise, the telecommuting revolution is here.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60675902a7d803001963e818?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Scott Galloway\" height=\"1083\" width=\"1560\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\"><a href=\"https://www.profgalloway.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Scott Galloway</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Back in 2017, I predicted <a href=\"https://www.profgalloway.com/retails-anti-christ/\">WeWork</a>, then worth $16 billion, would lose 75% of its value and become the &#34;poster child of unicorn mania.&#34; Two and a half years later, that prediction was wrong, very wrong - WeWork was preparing to go public on the heels of a $1 billion investment from Softbank that valued the company at $47 billion.</p><p>But it just didn&#39;t pencil out. After deploying my unique domain expertise (math) I concluded: &#34;Any equity analyst who endorses this stock above a $10 billion valuation is lying, stupid, or both.&#34;</p><p>The ensuing meltdown was cinematic - literally. Tonight, WeWork gets its closeup, in a documentary on Hulu, &#34;<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hulu.com%2Fmovie%2Fwework-or-the-making-and-breaking-of-a-47-billion-unicorn-c6deead3-f45f-43c6-b8bf-fc56e9f8a589\">The Making and Breaking of a $47 Billion Unicorn</a>.&#34; I&#39;m in it. I have not seen it, but it is awesome.</p><p>(BTW, the production company wanted me to come to a studio in New Jersey for filming. I told them I had a two hour window and that they needed to come to my place in SoHo or find another angry professor to make terse comments. They shuttled a dozen people to my place and set up a studio in my kids room, next to the climbing wall. At that moment, I realized that people tolerating you being an asshole doesn&#39;t make you … any less of an asshole.)</p><p>Anyway, that wasn&#39;t the end of the story of WeWork. Despite losing $60 million per week of Softbank&#39;s money in 2020, WeWork didn&#39;t go out of business. Instead, to the board&#39;s credit, the company fired the Jesus of reclaimed wood and smoked glass, Adam Neumann, and brought in an experienced manager. Sandeep Mathrani shed 100 of the company&#39;s worst performing properties along with the self-dealing arrangements foisted on the company by Neumann, and laid off 8,000 employees. A crisis is a terrible thing to waste, and if WeWork turns the corner to profitability in Q4 of this year, as it has promised investors, it will be the case study in fire intensity and germination.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5ed522853f7370106214bbd4?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Sandeep Mathrani\" height=\"1764\" width=\"2352\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Sandeep Mathrani of WeWork.\n<p class=\"copyright\">WeWork</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>The new WeWork is a stronger company than the 2017 model. It&#39;s still not worth $50 billion, but it might be worth $9B (or more). The new WeWork will benefit from the massive investments in space and brand equity (i.e., global awareness); additionally, people underestimate the difficulty of scaling &#34;vibe,&#34; where WeWork has a proven talent.</p><p>Most companies aren&#39;t going 100% remote. But when we return to the office, we will want less space that is more flexible, and more appealing to the premier asset of any firm: its ability to attract skilled, young human capital. Pre-corona, Section4 had a long term lease on 8,000 feet at $70 per square foot. Post-corona, it will probably be closer to 2,000 at $100, and on a year-to-year lease. Further out, I could see us opening offices in Miami or Austin, where great talent is migrating.</p><p>Imagine: a commercial real estate play, with properties around the world, configured as flexible office space, rentable by the hour, the day, or the month, with great community spaces, aspirational design, and strong tech. In sum, We might Work.</p><h2>Pass the pipe (here we go … again)</h2><p>However, Softbank has not run out of real estate opium quite yet. Now it is trying to pass the pipe to Compass investors, hoping the markets enter into consensual hallucination that a rollup of residential real estate brokerages is (wait for it) a tech company. Yesterday, Compass went public at a valuation of approximately 3x revenue. Realogy, the closest competitor, trades at 0.29x revenue. From the Compass site:</p><p><em>&#34;Compass is building the first modern real estate platform, pairing the industry&#39;s top talent with technology to make the search and sell experience intelligent and seamless.&#34;</em></p><p>The firm even describes itself as &#34;a tech company reinventing the space,&#34; despite the fact that it spent 78% of expenses on commissions to brokers, instead of technology or algorithms. This makes sense as Compass is … a real estate brokerage.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/6067593b856cd700198a2ec6?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Scott Galloway\" height=\"903\" width=\"1560\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\"><a href=\"https://www.profgalloway.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Scott Galloway</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Just before the IPO, the underwriters cut the pricing range and halved the number of shares offered.  Despite a massive haircut in supply, the first day pop was an anemic 12%. I&#39;ve worked at an investment bank taking companies public, founded companies that have gone public, and been on boards of companies going public. Dramatically reduced supply (shares) at a lower price, coupled with Goldman&#39;s unparalleled institutional base of buyers, and Compass barely got out. In sum, the corners of this trade are beginning to collapse and could lead to a broken IPO within days.

While other area hotels are overtly modern and luxe, the Williamsburg Hotel is both, but with a more intimate, laid-back vibe.&#160;</p><p><strong>COVID-19 procedures are available</strong>&#160;<a href=\"https://www.thewilliamsburghotel.com/travel-advisory\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>.</p><h3><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/the-williamsburg-hotel-review-new-york\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"40\">Read our full hotel review for The Williamsburg Hotel</a></h3>\n\tAce Hotel New York\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5db85205dee019586f1b9533?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Ace Hotel New York  Hotel review\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Jen Gushue</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<h3><a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=6776&#38;awinaffid=257137&#38;clickref=biip_121919_best-new-york-hotels&#38;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booking.com%2Fhotel%2Fus%2Face-new-york.en-gb.html%3Faid%3D898409%3Blabel%3Daffnetawin-index_pub-257137_site-1576790765131abapnokau_pname-Business%2520Insider_plc-_ts-_clkid-6776_1576796978_ea31d7fb96078abfef6c745b4f0a3ca4%3Bsid%3Daa37617f285310a3e4899f2ab43f877c%3Ball_sr_blocks%3D7951507_186035564_0_0_0%3Bcheckin%3D2020-05-03%3Bcheckout%3D2020-05-08%3Bdest_id%3D20088325%3Bdest_type%3Dcity%3Bdist%3D0%3Bgroup_adults%3D2%3Bgroup_children%3D0%3Bhapos%3D1%3Bhighlighted_blocks%3D7951507_186035564_0_0_0%3Bhpos%3D1%3Bno_rooms%3D1%3Broom1%3DA%252CA%3Bsb_price_type%3Dtotal%3Bsr_order%3Dpopularity%3Bsr_pri_blocks%3D7951507_186035564_0_0_0__162500%3Bsrepoch%3D1576796980%3Bsrpvid%3D9d47a2d9cab40003%3Btype%3Dtotal%3Bucfs%3D1%26%23hotelTmpl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\">Book Ace Hotel New York</a></h3><aside class=\"quick-tip headline-regular\"><p><strong>Category:</strong> Budget</p><p><strong>Neighborhood:</strong> NoMad</p><p><strong>Starting/peak prices: </strong>$175/$419</p><p><strong>Best for:</strong> Solo and business travelers</p><p><strong>On-site amenities: </strong>Trendy restaurant, bar, cafe, co-working spaces and designer shops</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> The Ace brand cool factor, a NoMad location, and on-site stores and eateries that are so good, you might not want to leave the property</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Some rooms show wear and tear and the lobby can feel crowded</p></aside><p>Ace Hotels have long established themselves as the cool kid, operating in hip cities like Portland, Palm Springs, Seattle and more.

We'd recommend Ace to anyone who wants to feel like one of the cool local kids spread out on the lobby's leather sofas to co-work.

One person might love city hotels and another will loathe the noise and crowds. Similarly, one traveler might simply seek a place to rest their head and another will want to be dazzled and delighted by luxury at every turn. Others have kids to entertain, business to tend to, and an itinerary to work around. Of course, all of these people do have in common: they all set a budget, whether it's looking for a cheap hotel or five-star luxury at an expected price.</p><p>For these reasons, this list of hotels offers a mix of all of these factors including:</p><p><strong>Price</strong>: We chose budget, mid-range, and luxury hotels in New York City ranging from bare-bones bunk rooms to standard hotel rooms and indulgent suites. We only accepted starting room rates in low season under $800 per night.</p><p><strong>Value</strong>: Price is one thing, but value is another. We chose hotels in New York City that offered strong value for the money such as large rooms, great views, good on-site amenities, excellent service, central locations, and more.</p><p><strong>Location</strong>: The best hotels in New York City represent a wide range of neighborhoods across Manhattan from the Upper East Side to TriBeCa and the Financial District in lower Manhattan. We also reviewed hotels in Brooklyn.</p><p><strong>Guests</strong>: We always think, \"who stays here?\" when reviewing hotels and chose the best hotels in New York City for families, couples, solo travelers, business travelers, groups of friends, and more so you can pick the best base for your particular trip.</p><p><strong>Reviews</strong>: We read and consulted past guest reviews and ratings on sites such as Trip Advisor, Hotels.com, Booking.com, and others to ensure that the majority of past guest experiences were overwhelmingly positive.</p><p><strong>Experience</strong>: We also visited and personally stayed at every hotel on this list. Included hotels were chosen based on first-hand experience considering every factor on this list rather than solely researching what others have said. We then visited to back up those claims.</p><p><strong>Cleanliness</strong>: Travel won't be the same post-pandemic for quite some time, so we only selected hotels that prioritize the health and safety of their guests either by imposing strict new cleaning policies in light of COVID-19 or temporarily closing until they can safely address all concerns.</p>\n\tMore of the best hotels in New York City\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/6036aff7bed5c50011a2c521?format=jpeg\" alt=\"the high line hotel new york\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Booking.com</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>These aren't the only hotels we've reviewed in New York City.

If you're planning on doing lots of sightseeing, consider visiting in the spring or fall when the temperatures are mild and it's comfortable to explore the city without worrying about extreme weather.</p><p>However, some people think visiting New York around the holidays is a magical time, and others like the summer when the city feels less crowded.</p><p><strong>What are the best neighborhoods to stay in when visiting New York City?</strong></p><p>If you're a first-time visitor who wants to see the lights of Broadway and stay in the center of the action, you're probably looking at Times Square. However, to feel more of a local, neighborhood vibe, consider staying in atmospheric neighborhoods such as Chelsea, Flatiron, NoMad, or adjacent areas of Midtown such as Bryant Park to experience fewer crowds.</p><p>If you've been to New York before, or are open to other areas, we recommend heading downtown to TriBeCa or across the bridge to Williamsburg or DUMBO in Brooklyn, all of which have great hotels (featured on this list).</p><p><strong>What are the cheapest times of year to visit? The most expensive?</strong></p><p>You'll often find the cheapest hotel prices in New York in the winter, right after the holidays and until early spring. Prices may dip again in late summer when high heat and humidity keep crowds low.</p><p>Expect prices to surge the highest from early September through the end of the year, when events such as New York Fashion Week and the holiday season pack in visitors and tourists consistently, year after year. During those times, even the cheapest budget hotels will see their base starting rates at least double in price.</p><p><strong>Is it safe to stay in hotels right now?</strong></p><p>With vaccine rollouts underway, many travelers are now looking to book postponed trips. And while <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-vacation-rentals-us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"20\">vacation rentals</a> continue to be very popular, hotels are open during COVID-19 and poised to make a big comeback as more people become fully vaccinated.&#160;</p><p>However, in hotels, you're more likely to encounter other people in common spaces such as lobbies, check-in desks, and on-site venues including pools, spas, restaurants, and bars. Thankfully, the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/are-hotels-safe-coronavirus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">experts we spoke to said that with added caution, it is safe to stay in a hotel</a>.&#160;</p><p>Of course, there's no guarantee of safety when it comes to travel. We recommend following CDC guidelines and wearing a mask in public, using hand sanitizer, and following social distancing.</p>\n</div><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

As of Tuesday, non-BIPOC Vermonters have to be 50 or older to get the vaccine. </p><p>Basically, a 30-year-old BIPOC Vermonter can get vaccinated right now, but a 30-year-old white Vermonter cannot. </p><p>The move has launched <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wesyang/status/1377824962711584772?s=20\">something of a moral panic among pundits</a>, but a quick look at Vermont&#39;s unique demographics and some basic understanding of public health explain why it&#39;s actually a great idea.</p><p>Vaccine distribution plans, in Vermont and across the country, have prioritized the most vulnerable populations from the start. A quick look at the numbers reveals that giving early vaccine access to Vermont&#39;s BIPOC population simply continues that strategy. </p><h2><strong>Vermont&#39;s unique demographics</strong></h2><p>Vermont is the second-least populated state in the country. It&#39;s also the whitest. With a population of only <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/VT\">630,000 people, 94% of whom are white</a>, there are only about 36,000 BIPOC people in Vermont. New York City has over 4 million BIPOC individuals, about half its population. The US. in total is 76% white, so Vermont is demographically very unique in that sense. </p><p>Not only is the BIPOC population of Vermont small in absolute terms and in proportion to the white population, it&#39;s also at higher risk. Vermont&#39;s BIPOC live mostly in denser populated areas with the <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/burlingtoncityvermont\">highest concentration in Burlington, Vermont&#39;s biggest and hardest hit city</a>. </p><h2><strong>Why vaccinating Vermont&#39;s BIPOC population makes sense</strong></h2><p>Nationally, BIPOC populations are <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/black-workers-essential-coronavirus-c502fc2e-a4fc-4c4f-ae0c-722a50d74ecd.html\">more likely to hold jobs as essential workers</a> or in roles that increase their exposure to COVID-19. By far, Burlington has more cases than the rest of Vermont, and it&#39;s known that Black Vermonters alone have the <a href=\"https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID19-Weekly-Data-Summary-3-26-2021.pdf\">highest rates of COVID in the state</a>.<em> </em></p><p>Also, BIPOC populations consistently prove harder to reach with public health initiatives. These groups are less likely to have a <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4899337/\">primary care doctor who they feel comfortable calling up for an appointment</a>. They face more significant <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/08/the-transportation-barrier/399728/\">transportation difficulties</a> in getting to an appointment. And their <a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5f85f5a156091e113f96e4d3/t/5fb72481b1eb2e6cf845457f/1605837977495/VaccineHesitancy_BlackLatinx_Final_11.19.pdf\">initial hesitancy</a> about the vaccine has been well-documented (though enthusiasm across racial and ethnic backgrounds <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/dashboard/kff-covid-19-vaccine-monitor-dashboard/?gclid=CjwKCAjwgZuDBhBTEiwAXNofRIfHNKxrcur9yoE50yuI8rc-ptKJOVb5kqObLhzvTD-_PfmQlvxx3xoCkgsQAvD_BwE\">continues to grow</a> overall, as availability becomes more widespread).</p><p>This all bears out on the numbers we&#39;re seeing for Vermont vaccination rates, with only <a href=\"https://www.mynbc5.com/article/vermont-focusing-vaccine-efforts-on-bipoc-population/35787178\">22%</a> of BIPOC Vermonters vaccinated, versus <a href=\"https://www.vpr.org/post/news-roundup-starting-thursday-all-bipoc-vermonters-are-eligible-vaccines#stream/0\">35% of the broader population</a>.  </p><p>Creating more opportunities for BIPOC people to get vaccinated will only help to protect these groups from their heightened risk from COVID-19. <em> </em></p><p><em><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/606789a8a7d803001963e9a7?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Jessica Frisco\" height=\"282\" width=\"377\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Jessica Frisco.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Jessica Frisco</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></em></p><h2><strong>It&#39;s not even that big of a deal</strong></h2><p>For white Vermonters under 50 years of age, the situation isn&#39;t that dire. Starting April 5, all Vermonters 40 and older can get vaccinated. On April 12, all Vermonters age 30 and older get their turn. On April 19, all Vermonters aged 16 and up can get vaccinated.</p><p>Stripped of all the racial commentary, all Vermont has done is allow a small, at-risk population to get vaccinated a few weeks ahead of other healthy, younger people.

The digital asset for the ethereum network has gained 177% in 2021 alone and 1,370% in the past 12 months. </p><p>&#34;It&#39;s very positive to see [ether] rally along with [bitcoin] which has been the de facto flag bearer for crypto assets,&#34;

John Wu, President at Ava Labs, the team behind Avalanche, told Insider. &#34;Ethereum breaking past this threshold may result in a paradigm shift that will benefit the two to three smart contract networks gaining real traction with decentralized finance.&#34;</p><p>Sergey Nazarov, co-founder of Chainlink lab,a decentralized oracle network, also attributed ether&#39;s rally to the rise of <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-invest-defi-bitcoin-crypto-cio-launches-new-fund-2021-2\">decentralized finance</a>, or DeFi, an umbrella term for various applications that use public blockchains and crypto assets to disrupt the traditional financial sectors. </p><p>&#34;Ethereum users are now relying on DeFi applications in order to lend, borrow, earn yield, create derivatives, options, and even trade, all without the reliance of any centralized third party like a bank or a fintech like Robinhood,&#34; Nazarov told Insider, adding that this new sector, worth <a href=\"https://links95.mixmaxusercontent.com/5fd3b03bf27084fd8d95e504/l/OWC6XNg51S7F4ZMYY?messageId=!!!MESSAGE_ID!!!&rn=!!!RECIPIENT_NAME_ENC!!!&re=!!!EMAIL_ADDR_ENC!!!&sc=!!!IS_SENDER_COPY!!!NDER_COPY!!!\">over $45 billion</a>, is the fastest growing in the cryptocurrency industry. </p><p>&#34;I would expect to see more users utilize DeFi on Ethereum as they hunt for yield that ranges in the double digits,&#34;

H&#38;M was directed by the regulator to study Chinese laws and &#34;really ensure the standardized use of the Chinese map,&#34; the Journal reports. </p><p>H&#38;M declined Insider&#39;s request for comment.</p><p>The retailer has drawn criticism from China in the past for labeling Hong Kong, Macau, and Tibet as countries, as well as labeling Taiwan as a country on the retailer&#39;s native Taiwan website, the Journal notes.</p><p>The government in Beijing considers Taiwan a province of China, not a country on its own, and has increased its military as <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/chinas-military-buildup-attitude-toward-taiwan-raises-conflict-fears-2020-9\">its attitude toward Taiwan has grown increasingly harsh</a>. </p><p>The Swedish retailer became enthralled in controversy following the resurfacing of <a href=\"https://www.insider.com/hm-chinese-e-commerce-boycott-social-media-firestorm-2021-3\">months-old comments about &#34;forced labor&#34;</a> of Uighur Muslims in the Xinjiang region.</p><p>Reports have found the Uighur minority community to be under persecution, through concentration camps and <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/china-forcibly-sterilizing-uighur-women-xinjiang-abortions-contraception-ap-2020-6\">forced sterilization</a>. China has maintained its position that the camps are <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/china-forcibly-sterilizing-uighur-women-xinjiang-abortions-contraception-ap-2020-6\">&#34;reeducation centers&#34;</a> designed to quell religious extremism and terrorist threats, not facilities designed to extinguish Uighur culture.</p><p>The comments were recirculated online last week after some governments, including the US, imposed sanctions on Chinese officials over allegations of human-rights violations. H&#38;M&#39;s criticism of forced labor in the country drew ire from Chinese consumers and companies, who boycotted the brand. Shortly after, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/hm-boycott-wiped-from-internet-china-2021-3\">H&#38;M appeared to be scrubbed from the internet in China</a>, with products missing from popular shopping sites and the location of H&#38;M&#39;s 500 stores removed from map services.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/hm-china-internet-boycott-uyghurs-2021-3\">H&#38;M has since responded to the backlash</a>, saying it is &#34;dedicated to regaining the trust and confidence of our customers, colleagues, and business partners in China.&#34;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/china-hm-problematic-maps-boycott-forced-labor-accusations-2021-4'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=qO-lwvSGuXU:HlWNpY_59_k:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=qO-lwvSGuXU:HlWNpY_59_k:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=qO-lwvSGuXU:HlWNpY_59_k:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=qO-lwvSGuXU:HlWNpY_59_k:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=qO-lwvSGuXU:HlWNpY_59_k:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=qO-lwvSGuXU:HlWNpY_59_k:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=qO-lwvSGuXU:HlWNpY_59_k:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=qO-lwvSGuXU:HlWNpY_59_k:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/qO-lwvSGuXU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 02 Apr 2021 19:37:38 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/60676794a7d803001963e8ae?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"49d0f28f88860cc43691714f43c6c952","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn59@2020_4/2021/04/03/04-49-34-772_2e7033720876513c.webp","destWidth":1688,"destHeight":1266,"sourceBytes":123430,"destBytes":123430,"author":"insider@insider.com (Katie Canales)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/60676794a7d803001963e8ae?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn59@2020_4/2021/04/03/04-49-34-772_2e7033720876513c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn57@2020_1/2021/04/03/04-49-56-622_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=qO-lwvSGuXU:HlWNpY_59_k:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn31@2020_3/2021/04/03/04-49-47-974_19dbbb04137d0c1a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=qO-lwvSGuXU:HlWNpY_59_k:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn7@2020_2/2021/04/03/04-49-59-637_b7973cb3a192a5c4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn52@2020_6/2021/04/03/04-49-50-912_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=qO-lwvSGuXU:HlWNpY_59_k:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn95@2020_4/2021/04/03/04-49-47-615_aa9d8fda6cb0287b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/qO-lwvSGuXU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn12@2020_3/2021/04/03/04-49-47-781_6dfeaf0dffd3a4b6.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617425373873},{"createdTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:33","updatedTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:33","title":"Why food tastes different on planes","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/airplane-food-tastes-different-explained-2020-1","description":"<div style=\"position:relative;

It&#39;s not a common juice, like orange or apple. So why are so many people drinking it in flight? Put simply? Your taste changes while you&#39;re in the air. And there&#39;s a biological reason for that.</p><p>If you grab a bite before your flight, you probably have an idea of what it will taste like. But once you&#39;re in the air, your sense of taste isn&#39;t the same as it is on the ground. A lot of factors on the plane are all coming together to suppress your sense of smell, which makes up a large portion of our sense of taste.</p><p>Think back to the last time you had a cold. Remember how you couldn&#39;t taste anything because your nose was clogged up? When you have a weakened sense of smell, your perception of taste is reduced. So your in-flight nose is similar to your nose when you have a cold, but hopefully with less phlegm.</p><p>Let&#39;s start with the cabin, which is extremely dry. Drier-than-some-deserts dry. The dry cabin dries out your nasal passages, which means your taste buds become less perceptive. But that&#39;s not the only part of the cabin suppressing your sense of taste. The low cabin pressure actually decreases the levels of oxygen in your blood, which means your olfactory receptors, the part of your nervous system that responds to smells, become less sensitive, which actually weakens your sense of smell.</p><p>But it&#39;s not just the environment inside the cabin that&#39;s affecting your senses. The noise coming from the engine isn&#39;t helping either. A 2010 study tested people&#39;s sense of taste both inside and outside a simulated plane cabin. The researchers found sensitivity to sweet and salty food was reduced by 30% while in the cabin.</p><p>And that weakened sense of taste can cause a lot of problems for airline caterers, who have to modify every recipe to account for it. To top it off, not every flavor is affected equally. Some ingredients, like curry and lemongrass, actually become more intense in the sky, while cinnamon, ginger, and garlic tend to maintain their taste. Some airlines will use naturally intense flavors, like certain fruit and vegetable oils and concentrates, which helps to lessen the amount of extra salt a recipe might need.</p><p>So, what does tomato juice have to do with all of this? Well, tomato juice tends to have a savory flavor referred to as umami. It&#39;s one of the five categories of taste, along with sweet, sour, salt, and bitter. A 2015 study found that, with umami, the taste phenomenon is actually reversed. Umami is actually enhanced in the air.</p><p>So the next time you&#39;re on a flight, give the tomato juice a try. And don&#39;t get too upset if your meal doesn&#39;t taste as good as you hoped. The chefs are just trying to accommodate for something you didn&#39;t know was happening right underneath your nose.</p><p><em>EDITOR&#39;S NOTE: This video was originally published in January

People who like scripted dramas and comedies, however, will have to look elsewhere. Discovery Plus is purely a service for fans of Discovery networks, and in that sense, its catalog offers a lot of value. </p><p>With classic titles pulled from all of Discovery&#39;s brands and networks, the service is jam-packed with blasts from the past, including &#34;Dirty Jobs,&#34; &#34;The Crocodile Hunter,&#34; &#34;Mythbusters,&#34; and &#34;Unwrapped.&#34; There are also dozens of new Discovery Plus Originals, like &#34;Cocktails and Tall Tales,&#34; &#34;Luda Can&#39;t Cook,&#34; and &#34;Monster Garage.&#34; </p><p>The original shows, in particular, have creative concepts - like rapper Ludacris learning how to cook different dishes. As a whole, the entire lineup features a solid selection of quality shows centered around the home, food, and history.</p><p>By our count, we found 91 programs listed as &#34;Discovery Plus Originals&#34; either with full episodes or trailers indicating they are coming soon. Not every original program was under the Discovery Plus Originals category, however, as we found at least 12 under the platform&#39;s tab for the upcoming Magnolia Network (rebrand of DIY Network).</p><h2>Interface</h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60676e09a7d803001963e8e3?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Discovery Plus Review show page\" height=\"1427\" width=\"2855\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Discovery Plus/Ben Blanchet/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>The <a href=\"https://www.discoveryplus.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Discovery Plus</a> interface works well enough but it doesn&#39;t have any standout characteristics and it can feel bulky and hard to navigate. It&#39;s particularly confusing to find the platform&#39;s 24/7 streaming channels, as they aren&#39;t on the sidebar or top menu like you&#39;d expect.</p><p>The platform&#39;s sidebar contains the basics for exploring the catalog, including a tab for browsing shows, a tab for saved programs (&#34;My List&#34;), and a search bar. The &#34;Browse&#34; tab allows you to find content by its original channel and also by category such as &#34;True Crime&#34; and &#34;Lifestyle.&#34; </p><p>To get to the 24/7 channels, you need to scroll down a bit on the &#34;For You&#34; page. This is also where you&#39;ll find rows for the platform&#39;s themed collections. The 24/7 channels are a terrific inclusion for binge-watchers as they let you stream non-stop episodes of &#34;House Hunters,&#34; &#34;Property Brothers,&#34; and &#34;90 Day Fiancé&#34; - I just wish they were easier to find.</p><p>One of the redeeming features of the Discovery Plus interface is its helpful recommendation feature. When visiting a show&#39;s main page there are up to 20 additional series recommendations to explore, making it easy to jump into similar programs you might like.</p><p>I was hopeful that the platform&#39;s &#34;My List&#34; would easily compile all my favorite content in one place, but it turns out that this feature doesn&#39;t let you save individual episodes. In addition to a limited &#34;Recently Watched&#34; section - which is only accessible on the &#34;For You&#34; page - there isn&#39;t a place to queue up specific episodes I want to watch over the span of a few hours. This makes the experience difficult as I have to go back and sort through shows to find episodes.</p><h2>Format support</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.discoveryplus.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Discovery Plus</a> does include some 4K titles for subscribers who have the necessary gear, but it&#39;s not easy to find these programs as there&#39;s no specific 4K category in the main menu.</p><p>The platform requires you to search &#34;Ultra HD&#34; to find this content. After you do this, an &#34;Ultra HD&#34; tab will appear in the results. Once you click on a 4K title, a &#34;UHD&#34; icon will appear on its page to let you know that it plays in 4K. That said, the icon may not appear on certain devices.</p><p>While most of the UHD content is limited to a few nature programs - such as &#34;Planet Earth II&#34; and BBC&#39;s &#34;Dynasties&#34; - I was surprised to find programs like &#34;NASA Mars Landing,&#34; &#34;Misfit Garage&#34; and &#34;American Titans&#34; in 4K quality. On the downside, unlike Netflix and other popular 4K services, Discovery Plus does not support <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-hdr-tv\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HDR</a>.</p><h2>Devices and features</h2><p>Discovery Plus <a href=\"https://help.discoveryplus.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500000101182-Browsers-and-devices-supported-by-discovery-\">is compatible with most media players and smart TV platforms</a>, with the exception of PlayStation devices.</p><p>While Discovery Plus is relatively new and will likely roll out new features throughout 2021, there are already obvious faults that I hope it fixes.</p><p>One of these is the lack of offline downloads, making Discovery Plus the only major streaming service that doesn&#39;t provide this feature.</p><p>Aside from that drawback, Discovery Plus is mostly on par with other platforms thanks to its 4K content and support for up to four simultaneous streams (just like <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Disney Plus</a>).

href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">See more stories on Insider&#39;s business page</a>.</li>\n</ul><p><em>Following is a transcript of the video.</em></p><p>Early in the history of our solar system, something mysteriously knocked Earth slightly off its axis. So today we tilt at 23.5 degrees. But what would happen if we tilted even more? What if Earth spun sideways on its axis? Well, it wouldn&#39;t take long before utter chaos ensued.</p><p>One of the most important consequences of Earth&#39;s axial tilt is the seasons. Seasons happen because the tilt points different parts of the planet toward the sun at different times of the year. But the tilt also means that different parts of the globe receive different amounts of sunlight during each season. And that&#39;s where a more extreme tilt starts to cause problems. Right now, during the summer in the Northern Hemisphere, places far north, like Utqiagvik, Alaska, receive 24 hours of sunlight for 82 days straight. Because Earth is tilted far enough on its axis that as the planet rotates, Utqiagvik never leaves direct sunlight. On the other hand, the contiguous US receives a max of 17 hours a day, because after that it rotates out of daytime sunlight and into night. But if we tilted Earth&#39;s axis even more, to 90 degrees, the US would get sunlight 24/7, around the clock, for months on end. And it&#39;s not just the US; the entire Northern Hemisphere would be like this.</p><p>At first, animals would take advantage of the extra light to find and eat more food, just like Alaskan birds, which feed their chicks extra nutrition in the summer, resulting in faster-growing babies than their southern counterparts. And plant growth would explode since they get their energy directly from sunlight. Farms in northern Alaska, for example, grow cabbages the size of rottweilers in the summer.</p><p>But while animals and plants would thrive, humans wouldn&#39;t. We evolved to be active during the day and sleep at night. But if we were exposed to unending sunlight, our brains would stop producing the hormone melatonin, which we need to sleep at night. And that could lead to sleep deprivation, depression, and, ultimately, a more severe, chronic version of these symptoms called seasonal affective disorder, which already affects 9% of Alaskans, compared to just 6% of the entire United States.</p><p>But that&#39;s less of a worry than the floods. Temperatures at the North Pole would more than double, to 38 degrees Celsius from 15.5 degrees Celsius. That&#39;s hotter than temperatures at the equator today. As a result, Greenland&#39;s ice cap would melt, causing sea levels to rise by 7 meters, and flood nearly every coastal city on Earth. Say goodbye to New York, Copenhagen, and Tokyo. To make matters worse, the warmer seas would trigger stronger and more frequent hurricanes, which form when seawater evaporates at the surface.</p><p>And the weather wouldn&#39;t get better when winter comes six months later. Out of reach of the sun&#39;s direct beams for months at a time, the hemisphere would get colder than any winter on record. Swirls of frigid air, called a polar vortex, which are normally dissipated by warm air in the tropics, could travel all the way down to the equator. Imagine blizzards in Florida, Brazil, Kenya! And all those thriving plants, they&#39;d die from a lack of sunlight. Agriculture would collapse as ecosystems crumble and mass extinctions pile up.</p><p>And there would be even more floods, because meanwhile, the Southern Hemisphere is getting toasty and the South Pole is home to 90% of the world&#39;s ice. The constant sunlight would raise its temperature to 38 degrees Celsius from -28 degrees Celsius, melting the ice and raising sea levels by a whopping 61 meters. That&#39;s almost as tall as the Leaning Tower of Pisa. Greenland&#39;s flood would look like a puddle in comparison.</p><p>So all in all, while a few extra hours in the summer sun would be nice, let&#39;s leave the extra seasons to Alaska and be glad the Earth is tilted exactly as it is.</p><p><em>EDITOR&#39;S NOTE: This video was originally published in July 2019.</em></p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/earth-axis-spun-sideways-extreme-summer-winter-seasons-2019-7'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=lQ7GZRa13OU:NowMbeuHo_E:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=lQ7GZRa13OU:NowMbeuHo_E:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=lQ7GZRa13OU:NowMbeuHo_E:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=lQ7GZRa13OU:NowMbeuHo_E:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=lQ7GZRa13OU:NowMbeuHo_E:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=lQ7GZRa13OU:NowMbeuHo_E:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=lQ7GZRa13OU:NowMbeuHo_E:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=lQ7GZRa13OU:NowMbeuHo_E:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/lQ7GZRa13OU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 02 Apr 2021 20:33:40 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5d2e25dfa17d6c56621b46b8?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"5ed5b6805198f42fdbcfba5b1d997290","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn60@2020_1/2021/04/03/04-49-41-273_c4800a2933c9dd38.webp","destWidth":1729,"destHeight":1296,"sourceBytes":221242,"destBytes":221242,"author":"aschmitz@businessinsider.com (Andrea Schmitz,Shira Polan)","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn57@2020_1/2021/04/03/04-49-56-622_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=lQ7GZRa13OU:NowMbeuHo_E:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn19@2020_5/2021/04/03/04-49-51-399_e962de2bb450ffb0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=lQ7GZRa13OU:NowMbeuHo_E:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn15@2020_2/2021/04/03/04-49-44-143_d87958da2d329865.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn52@2020_6/2021/04/03/04-49-50-912_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=lQ7GZRa13OU:NowMbeuHo_E:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn14@2020_3/2021/04/03/04-49-54-260_fed18e196ad0a80d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/lQ7GZRa13OU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn88@2020_3/2021/04/03/04-50-04-249_cbbd8e5b5bf5a6ac.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617425373746},{"createdTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:33","updatedTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:33","title":"Police officer killed and suspect shot dead after vehicle attack at US Capitol","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/us-capitol-is-on-lockdown-over-an-external-security-threat-2021-4","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60675acfa7d803001963e82a?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Capitol car crash\" height=\"888\" width=\"1776\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Capitol Police officers near a car that crashed into a barrier on Capitol Hill on April 2.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Scott J.
