Things we take for granted today, like texting emoji, sharing funny YouTube videos, or taking smartphone selfies were all years away.  <br><br>Of course, changes in technology have meant changes for digital marketers. There’s been an explosion of channels, formats and data. Consumers are also more aware of how they’re being marketed to and how their data is being used—and they want more control.  <br><br>To address these new realities, marketers need tools that make it easy to get better results from their marketing in a way that puts privacy first. <br><br>This is why we’re announcing <a href=\"https://marketingplatform.google.com/about?utm_source=ga-blog&utm_medium=et&utm_campaign=introducing-google-marketing-platform\">Google Marketing Platform</a>.  <center><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-V3XP5tZi5VM/WymL6Zi8i4I/AAAAAAAALrA/p06t0l4S5dk8ceIGfL298bTi-2f5pQBEwCLcBGAs/s1600/GMP_Logo_Animation_Loop.gif\" data-original-width=\"1600\" data-original-height=\"686\" /></center> Google Marketing Platform brings together DoubleClick Digital Marketing and the Google Analytics 360 Suite to help you plan, buy, measure and optimize digital media and customer experiences in one place. Google Marketing Platform helps you deliver more relevant and effective marketing, while ensuring that you respect your customers’ privacy and give them control over their data.  <center><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-oAyMPdidZKA/Wy18795evPI/AAAAAAAALtQ/2L2W9J-NYfEcEDLL7GQnmSod1Y0Mjw-sgCLcBGAs/s800/Google%2BMarketing%2BPlatform.png\"></center>  In our recent <a href=\"https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/resources/bain-report-how-top-brands-grow-with-timely-customer-connections?utm_source=ga-blog&utm_medium=et&utm_campaign=introducing-google-marketing-platform\">survey</a> of global marketing organizations, we learned that the #1 priority for marketers is to better understand their customers. By offering tools that make it easy to collaborate and share insights, Google Marketing Platform helps achieve this customer-first approach to marketing.  <br><br>In the U.S., adidas has started working more collaboratively across their digital teams to share insights and get a deeper understanding of their customers. Chris Murphy, Head of Digital Experience, describes their approach:  <br><br><blockquote>“Our adidas teams work together in one environment where we can see audience insights, what creative we’re running and where, how it’s performing, and make changes almost in real time.”<br><font size=\"-1\">Chris Murphy, Head of Digital Experience, adidas</font> </blockquote><br><center><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"385\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lCz0cGIWmlU?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe></center> <br> <h3>Better results with ads plus analytics</h3> Google Marketing Platform builds on existing integrations between the Google Analytics 360 Suite and DoubleClick advertiser products. Marketers have seen great results when they use ads and analytics technology together. For example, BookIt used Analytics 360 to uncover insights about the types of travelers interested in their brand and used these insights to create more relevant campaigns in Display & Video 360. The result was a <a href=\"https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/resources/bookit-moves-new-users-through-funnel-using-insights-driven-creative/?utm_source=ga-blog&utm_medium=et&utm_campaign=introducing-google-marketing-platform\">20 percent increase in revenue</a>. <br><br>Now, with Google Marketing Platform, we’re introducing ways to make our products work even better together. For example, the new Integration Center helps you discover and easily setup valuable connections between products.   <center><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-xfOJ_1VoX1A/Wy15kKbryzI/AAAAAAAALs0/jtRZWjvZzo8OjuBiN1OZUEZR05aKCKRKgCLcBGAs/s640/Google-Marketing-Platform-Integration-Center.jpg\"></center>  Google Marketing Platform also supports 100+ integrations with exchanges, measurement solutions, and other technology providers. In short, you can choose what media you buy, how you buy it, and how you measure it. <br><br><h3>Search Ads 360 and Display & Video 360</h3> With Google Marketing Platform, we’re also making changes to some of our advertising products. <br><br>Search Ads 360 is the new name for DoubleClick Search. Search Ads 360 will continue to help you plan, buy, and measure your search campaigns on Google and other search engines.  <br><br>Display & Video 360 brings together features from our display advertising products: DoubleClick Bid Manager, Campaign Manager, Studio and Audience Center. Display & Video 360 allows you to execute ad campaigns end-to-end in one place, creating efficiency in how you work and helping your teams do more together. <br><br>Don’t worry, Campaign Manager and other DoubleClick products aren’t going anywhere right away. We’ll gradually transition customers to Display & Video 360 as additional features become available.  <br><br><h3>Looking ahead</h3> This is just the beginning of the next chapter in our platforms story. We’re committed to building solutions that help you achieve your marketing goals while meeting consumers' high expectations for privacy, transparency and control. <br><br>We’ll be sharing more about Google Marketing Platform and Display & Video 360 at Google Marketing Live. <a
