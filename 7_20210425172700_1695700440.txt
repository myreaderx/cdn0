To take us one step closer, today we’re sharing Developer Preview 3, the next milestone release of Android 12, for your testing and feedback. \n</p>\n<p>\nIn Android 12 we’re continuing to focus on making the OS smarter, easier to use, and better performing, with privacy and security at the core. We’re also working to give you new tools for building great experiences for users on phones, laptops, tablets, TVs, or cars. Some things to check out in today’s release include a new app launch experience, new video and camera capabilities to help you get more out of underlying hardware support, and a new permission for exact alarms to help users save battery. \n</p>\n<p>\nRead on for more highlights and <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12\">visit the Android 12 developer site</a> for details and downloads for Pixel. If you’re already running a Developer Preview 2 build, watch for an over-the-air (OTA) update coming to you soon! As always, <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/feedback\">let us know what you think</a>, and thanks for all of the feedback you’ve shared so far. \n</p>\n<h2><strong>Better user experience tools</strong></h2>\n\n\n<p>\nToday’s release includes new tools to help you deliver a polished experience and better performance for users. Here are some of the updates. \n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Improved app launch experience</strong> - In Android 12 we’re making app startup a more consistent and delightful experience. We’ve added a new app launch animation for all apps from the point of launch, a splash screen showing the app icon, and a transition to the app itself. The new experience brings standard design elements to every app launch, but we’ve also made it customizable so apps can maintain their unique branding. For example, you can use new <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/android/window/SplashScreen\">splashscreen APIs</a> and resources to manage the splash screen window’s <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr#windowSplashScreenBackground\">background color</a>; you can replace the static launcher icon with a <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr#windowSplashScreenBrandingImage\">custom icon</a> or an <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr#windowSplashScreenAnimatedIcon\">animation</a>; you can set light mode or dark mode; and you can control the timing to <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/android/window/SplashScreenView?hl=en#remove()\">reveal the app</a> in the <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/android/window/SplashScreen.OnExitAnimationListener\">exit animation</a>. \n</p>\n<p>\nThere’s nothing you need to do to take advantage of the new experience - it’s enabled by default for all apps. We recommend testing your app with the new experience soon, especially if you’re already using a splash screen. To customize the experience, check out the new APIs and let us know what you think. <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/features/splash-screen\">More here</a>. \n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>New call notification template</strong> - Incoming and ongoing calls are important to users and they need to be easy to see and manage. In Android 12 we’re improving call notifications to give them more visibility and scannability, and improve their consistency with other notification components. If your app handles calls - such as a dialer app or chat app with video calling - you’ll want to try our new <code><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Notification.CallStyle.html\">CallStyle</a></code> template. You can use the template to create notifications for incoming, outgoing, and screened calls. Each type supports multiple actions, including default actions and custom actions that are specific to your app. You can also attach a large avatar image, provide text, and set button color hints. The OS gives <code><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Notification.CallStyle.html\">CallStyle</a></code> notifications high visibility, such as bringing them to the top of the notifications shade. <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/features#new-calls\">More here</a>. \n\n<p>\n<strong>New permission for exact alarms</strong> - Alarms are an important way for apps to schedule work. In most cases, apps should use <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/AlarmManager#setAndAllowWhileIdle(int,%20long,%20android.app.PendingIntent)\">inexact alarms</a>, which have the advantage of being battery-friendly. Android manages these alarms to minimize wakeups and battery impacts, such as through <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/training/monitoring-device-state/doze-standby\">Doze and App Standby</a>. For cases where you need alarms with precise timing - for example alarm clocks and timers - you can use <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/AlarmManager#setExact(int,%20long,%20android.app.PendingIntent)\">exact alarms</a> instead. These are convenient and reliable, but they can also cause battery drain, especially when overused. So in Android 12, we’re making some changes to give users more control. \n</p>\n<p>\nApps targeting Android 12 that want to use exact alarms will now need to request a new permission,<code> <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM\">SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM</a></code>. It’s a normal permission, so once you’ve declared it in your manifest, you’ll be automatically granted it at first startup. However, we’re also giving users visibility over the apps that have this permission and letting them grant and revoke it from Special App Access Permissions in Settings. If your app requires exact alarms, make sure you handle cases where it no longer has the permission. We’ve added a new API, <code><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/AlarmManager.html#canScheduleExactAlarms()\">canScheduleExactAlarms()</a></code>, to let you check the permission status for your app. In general, we recommend migrating your apps away from uses of exact alarms wherever possible. More <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/behavior-changes-12#exact-alarm-permission\">here</a>. \n\n<p>\n<strong>Improved web linking </strong>- In Android 12 we’re making some changes to help users get to their content faster and more seamlessly. First, we’ve changed the default handling of links that aren’t verified through <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/training/app-links\">Android App Links</a> or manually approved for links by the user. Now the OS will directly open them in the default browser, rather than showing a chooser dialog. To make it easier for users to approve your app for links, we’ve added a <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/Settings?ENABLE_REBRAND=false#ACTION_APP_OPEN_BY_DEFAULT_SETTINGS\">new Intent</a> that takes them to “Open by default” in Settings. If you want to ensure that only your app can handle links from your domain, you can use App Links. We’ve added new <code>adb</code> commands to help you configure and test your links. More <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/web-intent-resolution\">here</a>. \n</p>\n\n<p>\n<strong>Rich haptic experiences</strong> - We’re expanding the tools we offer for creating informative haptic feedback for UI events, immersive and delightful effects for gaming, and attentional haptics for productivity. We’ve added expressive effects like <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/VibrationEffect.Composition#PRIMITIVE_LOW_TICK\">low tick</a> that take advantage of the broader frequency bandwidth of the latest actuators. Game developers can now access <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/VibratorManager.html\">multiple, different actuators</a> independently in game controllers to deliver the same effect synchronously or different haptic effects on <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/CombinedVibrationEffect.html\">multiple actuators</a>. For developers, we recommend using the <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/HapticFeedbackConstants\">constants</a> and <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/VibrationEffect.Composition#summary\">primitives</a> as building blocks for rich haptic effects - constants to enhance UI events and <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/VibrationEffect.Composition\">haptic composer</a> to sequence primitives for more complex effects. You can try these APIs to the fullest on Pixel 4 devices today, and we’re continuing to work with our device-maker partners to bring the latest in haptics support to users across the ecosystem. \n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Video encoding improvements</strong> - Android 12 standardizes the set of keys for controlling the range of the video Quantization Parameters (QP), allowing developers to avoid vendor-specific code. The new keys are available in the <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/MediaFormat.html#KEY_VIDEO_QP_B_MAX\">MediaFormat API</a> and also in the <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/ndk/reference/group/media\">NDK Media library</a>.  Video encoders must specify a minimum video quality threshold to ensure that users don't experience extremely low quality when videos are complex.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Camera2 vendor extensions</strong> - Many of our device manufacturer partners have built custom camera effects—such as bokeh, HDR, night mode, and others—that they want apps to use to create differentiated experiences on their devices. We’ve already supported these custom effects through a set of vendor extensions in our <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/training/camerax/vendor-extensions\">CameraX library</a>, and now in Android 12 we’re exposing the vendor extensions directly in the platform as well. This helps apps that have complex <code><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/camera2/package-summary\">Camera2</a></code> implementations to take advantage of the extensions without having to make significant changes to legacy code. The extension APIs expose exactly the <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/camera2/CameraExtensionCharacteristics\">same set of effects</a> as in CameraX, and those are already supported on <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/training/camerax/devices\">many different devices</a>, so you can use them right out of the box. More <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/camera2/CameraExtensionCharacteristics\">here</a>. \n\n<p>\n<strong>Quad bayer camera sensor support</strong> - Many Android devices today ship with ultra high-resolution camera sensors, typically with Quad / Nona Bayer patterns, and these offer great flexibility in terms of image quality and low-light performance. In Android 12, we’re introducing new platform APIs that let third-party apps take full advantage of these versatile sensors. The <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/camera2/CameraMetadata.html#REQUEST_AVAILABLE_CAPABILITIES_ULTRA_HIGH_RESOLUTION_SENSOR\">new APIs</a> support the unique behavior of these sensors and take into account that they might support different stream configurations and combinations when operating in full resolution or ‘maximum resolution’ mode vs ‘default’ mode. \n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Faster machine learning </strong>- In Android 12, we invested in key areas so that developers can make the most of ML accelerators and always get the best possible performance through the Neural Networks API. In terms of performance improvements - we have more than halved inference call overhead by introducing improvements such as padding, sync fences and reusable execution objects. We’ve also made ML accelerator drivers updatable outside of platform releases, through Google Play services. This will make it easier for developers to take advantage of the latest drivers on any compatible device, and make sure that ML performance improvements and bug fixes reach users faster than ever before.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Standardizing GPU compute</strong> - We are deprecating the RenderScript APIs in favor of cross-platform GPU compute solutions such as Vulkan and OpenGL. We want you to have confidence that your high-performance workloads will run on GPU hardware, and many devices are already shipping with only CPU support for RenderScript. The existing APIs will continue to work for the time-being, and we've open-sourced a library for RenderScript intrinsics such as blur that uses the highly-optimized intrinsics platform code. Samples and a migration guide for using Vulkan to implement image processing are also available. More <a href=\"https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/04/android-gpu-compute-going-forward.html\">here</a>.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Better debugging for native crashes</strong> - You've told us that debugging NDK-related crashes can be challenging. We’re making this easier in Android 12 by giving you more actionable diagnostics. In the platform, we use crash dump files called <a href=\"https://source.android.com/devices/tech/debug#debuggerd\">tombstones</a> to debug our native crashes, and they contain the information required to diagnose a variety of issues; this includes unwinding through ART, integrating with <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/about/versions/11/behavior-changes-all#fdsan\">fdsan</a>, and recording all the stacks involved in a <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/gwp-asan\">GWP-ASan</a>, <a href=\"https://source.android.com/devices/tech/debug/hwasan\">HWASan</a>, or <a href=\"https://source.android.com/devices/tech/debug/tagged-pointers\">MTE</a> crash. Now we’re giving your app access to its tombstone files through the <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/android/app/ActivityManager#gethistoricalprocessexitreasons\">App Exit Reasons API</a>. When your app uses `<a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/android/app/ApplicationExitInfo\">ApplicationExitInfo</a>` with `<a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/android/app/ApplicationExitInfo#reason_crash_native\">REASON_CRASH_NATIVE</a>`, you can now call `<a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/ApplicationExitInfo#getTraceInputStream()\">getTraceInputStream()</a>` to get the tombstone data as a protocol buffer.  \n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>More-flexible backup configurations</strong> - Android’s backup service lets users restore or migrate their data to a new device effortlessly. Apps are central to the experience, enabling users to easily transfer app data and continue where they left off. The backup service supports both cloud backups to Google Drive and device-to-device transfers, and developers can take advantage of these with minimal changes in their apps. For apps targeting Android 12, we’re improving the service to give you more flexibility and control. We’ve updated the XML configuration format so you can now set different rules for cloud backups and device-to-device transfers. With this, for example, you could exclude a large file from cloud backups but include it in device-to-device transfers. You can also set encryption requirements separately for backups or transfers. Last, if you’d like to opt-out of Auto Backup for device-to-device transfers, please use the new configuration format instead of the <code><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#allowBackup\">allowBackup</a></code> manifest attribute.

In Android 12, we’ve made most app-facing changes opt-in to give you more time, and we’ve updated our tools and processes to help you get ready sooner. \n</p>\n<p>\nWith Developer Preview 3, we’re moving closer to our first Beta release as we continue to improve stability. Now is the time to try the new features and changes and let us know how these work with your apps.

As Android has evolved, the NDK tooling and APIs for <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/android/opengl/GLES31\">GPU compute using OpenGL</a> have dramatically improved. In Android 7.0 (API level 24), we added the <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/graphics?hl=en\">Vulkan API</a>, which allows for low-level access to GPU hardware features. In Android 10.0 (API level 29) we added the capability to easily share <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Bitmap#wrapHardwareBuffer(android.hardware.HardwareBuffer,%20android.graphics.ColorSpace)\">Bitmap hardware buffers</a> between Android SDK and NDK code to speed image processing. \n</p>\n<p>\nWe no longer recommend RenderScript as the optimal way to accomplish these performance-critical tasks, and will be deprecating the APIs in Android 12. We want you to have confidence that your high-performance workloads will run on GPU hardware, and many devices are already shipping with only CPU support for RenderScript. The APIs will continue to function, but compiling RenderScript code when targeting Android 12 will give a warning.\n</p>\n<h2>How we’re addressing RenderScript intrinsics</h2>\n\n\n<p>\nThe RenderScript subsystem was also used to implement a number of useful image-processing intrinsics. We're providing an <a href=\"https://github.com/android/renderscript-intrinsics-replacement-toolkit\">open-source library</a> that contains the highly-tuned CPU implementations for all but the Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS) intrinsics. For the cases that we have measured, intrinsics execute faster (often substantially so) on the CPU using our library than running within RenderScript, even on devices where GPU support was possible.\n</p>\n<p>\nFor BLAS, we suggest using one of the many libraries that already provide this functionality, such as netlib’s <a href=\"http://www.netlib.org/blas/\">libblas</a>.\n</p>\n\n\n<p>\nPlease file issues with the library <a href=\"https://github.com/android/renderscript-intrinsics-replacement-toolkit/issues\">here</a>. \n</p>\n\n<h2>If you use RenderScript scripts:</h2>\n\n\n<p>\nTo take full advantage of GPU acceleration, we recommend migrating RenderScript scripts to the cross-platform Vulkan API. To help get you started with this transition, we have provided a <a href=\"https://github.com/android/renderscript-samples/tree/main/RenderScriptMigrationSample/\">sample app</a> that demonstrates two RenderScript scripts with Vulkan equivalents. \n</p>\n<ul>\n\n<li>The first script is the “hello world” of RenderScript; it rotates the hue of the image.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n\n<li>The second script implements blur, using multiple cells of the input allocation to figure out one cell of the output allocation. (Note that the highly-optimized blur in our static library has broader device compatibility and faster performance than this sample script in many cases.)\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nBecause Vulkan is not available on older devices, you may need to manage two code paths: RenderScript on older devices and Vulkan on newer ones. <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/renderscript/migrate\">Our documentation has more details on how to migrate.</a> <p> You can file issues with the sample <a href=\"https://github.com/android/renderscript-samples/issues\">here</a>.\n</p>\n</p>\n<h2>Thank you</h2>\n\n\n<p>\nWe on the RenderScript team thank you for your support over the years.

I had an opportunity to create an app from scratch. My first app had in-app-purchasing, notifications, and video playback. It wasn’t easy. I was the only Android developer and I learned as I went along. I kept building on this experience and have worked on building many apps in the past 10 years.</em> </p> <p> <em>In my journey, I was an early adopter of Kotlin. During that time, there were very few resources to learn Kotlin. I learned Kotlin by converting lots of Java code to Kotlin. I’m grateful to have learned Kotlin early on. Coding is what I do, but not who I am. There have been many obstacles in my journey. But, Kotlin was my medium to discover my passion. It has had a profound impact on my life.</em> </p> <p> <em>I have helped companies adopt Kotlin and Kotlin Coroutines on both Android and backend. I enjoy teaching it. I shared my experiences through tech talks. For the past eight years I gave a tech talk every month in the NYC community. Every talk has meant so much to me, because of what I went through to prepare for it. My adversity has been my motivator. Everyone sees the results, but not the process. I discovered my passion for public speaking and developer advocacy. After eight years, I became a GDE in Android &amp; Kotlin and I’m still on this journey to inspire others.</em> </p> <p> <strong>What’s one shortcut, tip, or hack you can’t live without?</strong> </p> <p> <em>Finding ways to incorporate automation in your solutions is one of the attributes of a good developer. I have observed it in many examples through out my career. For example, a developer wrote an annotation processor to generate custom adapters and to generate models based on API specifications. Another example is a developer who wrote a generator to setup the scaffolding for a module. Its valuable to find ways to automate tasks.</em> </p> <p> <strong>What's the one piece of advice you wish someone would have given you when you started on your journey?</strong> </p> <p> <em>You will seldomly work on green field projects. You will work on an app that already exists and has been built over the years. You’ll work on teams that have diverse perspectives on best practices on Android throughout your career. You may not work on an Android app that is using a modern Android development stack. You’ll find many obstacles navigating this spectrum. But, the obstacle is the way. </em> </p> <h2>Imangi Studios</h2> \n    <center> \n     <a href=\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/blogspot/hsDu/~3/gX1qlIkEMp8/ https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8x1fwM-8HWQ/YIM_8kong1I/AAAAAAAAQZs/YeAXRw5hu7Uz8rtB1jh-ie3OsWVB6DRewCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/ADJ_twitter_ImangiStudios.jpeg \" imageanchor=\"1\"><img style=\"width:100%\" id=\"imgFull\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8x1fwM-8HWQ/YIM_8kong1I/AAAAAAAAQZs/YeAXRw5hu7Uz8rtB1jh-ie3OsWVB6DRewCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/ADJ_twitter_ImangiStudios.jpeg \" alt=\"Photo of Imangi  Studios team within Android Dev Journey card.\" data-original-width=\"1058\" data-original-height=\"714\" /></a> \n    </center> <p> <strong>Tell me about your journey to becoming an Android Developer and how you got started.</strong> </p> <p> <em>We first became an Android Developers when we made Temple Run!

Here I was introduced to Android development by the then instructor and cofounder <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tamrefrank\">Frank Tamre</a>.

One of my lecturers had some friends who were looking to build an app for their company. Truth is, at this point I had not even had an Android phone for long but I jumped at the chance to build something for a real client. During this build, I pretty much fell in love with Android and quickly became fascinated in how portable and accessible things that you build would become. As soon as I started building that project, I knew this is how I wanted my start off my career. </em> </p> <p> <strong>What’s one shortcut, tip, or hack you can’t live without?</strong> </p> <p> <em>For me, split screen in <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/studio/?gclid=Cj0KCQjw4ImEBhDFARIsAGOTMj_H7zChTuuH05yInMz5Nlzr9disjvw0Eb2ClRGM6VQ3q2-1tgB6ONwaAgnMEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds\">Android Studio</a> has really helped my productivity when working on some projects. Whether it's during refactoring or working with a file and its corresponding tests, being able to display multiple files side-by-side removes the need to manually hop between them. Within Android Studio, you can do this by right-clicking on the tab for a file and selecting either \"Split Horizontally\" or \"Split Vertically.” The selected file will then shift to a seperate section and you can work on that code at the same time as another file within a separate section.</em> </p> <p> <strong>What's the one piece of advice you wish someone would have given you when you started on your journey?</strong> </p> <p> <em>Don't get too caught up in making things perfect or strictly following standards. When I started out building things privately or sharing things in the public, I felt I had to match up to these and was worried too much about making mistakes. </em> </p> <p> <em>All learning is a journey, we will always make mistakes and that's where growth comes from! While topics things can be important, getting something tangible in your hands can be incredibly motivating - something that can be slowed down greatly if you get caught up here. It's still worth diving in deeper and learning how things work once you have something working, but it can be inspiring to get something built without getting caught up in too many of the details!</em> </p> <br> \n     <hr>\n      <p>The Android Developer community prides itself in its inclusivity and welcomes developers from all backgrounds and stages of life.

past year, users have become increasingly dependent on their mobile devices to create fitness routines, stay connected with loved ones, work remotely, and order things like groceries with ease. According to <a href=\"https://www.emarketer.com/content/us-adults-will-spend-over-three-hours-per-day-on-mobile-apps-2020\">eMarketer</a>, in 2020 users spent over three and a half hours per day using mobile apps. With so much time spent on mobile devices, ensuring the safety of mobile apps is more important than ever. Despite the importance of digital security, there isn’t a consistent industry standard for assessing mobile apps. Existing guidelines tend to be either too lightweight or too onerous for the average developer, and lack a compliance arm. That’s why we're excited to share <a href=\"https://www.ioxtalliance.org/news-events-blog/ioxt-alliance-expands-certification-program-for-mobile-and-vpn-security\">ioXt’s announcement</a> of a new <a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5c6dbac1f8135a29c7fbb621/t/604aa3fa668a8e3b50630433/1615504379349/Mobile_Application_Profile.pdf\">Mobile Application Profile</a> which provides a set of security and privacy requirements with defined acceptance criteria which developers can certify their apps against. \n</p>\n<p>\nOver 20 industry stakeholders, including <strong>Google</strong>, <strong>Amazon</strong>, and a number of certified labs such as <strong>NCC Group</strong> and <strong>Dekra</strong>, as well as automated mobile app security testing vendors like <strong>NowSecure</strong> collaborated to develop this new security standard for mobile apps. We’ve seen early interest from Internet of Things (IoT) and virtual private network (VPN) developers, however the standard is appropriate for any cloud connected service such as social, messaging, fitness, or productivity apps.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe <a href=\"http://ioxtalliance.org/\">Internet of Secure Things Alliance (ioXt)</a> manages a security compliance assessment program for connected devices. ioXt has over 300 members across various industries, including Google, Amazon, Facebook, T-Mobile, Comcast, Zigbee Alliance, Z-Wave Alliance, Legrand, Resideo, Schneider Electric, and many others. With so many companies involved, ioXt covers a wide range of device types, including smart lighting, smart speakers, and webcams, and since most smart devices are managed through apps, they have expanded coverage to include mobile apps with the launch of this profile.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe ioXt <a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5c6dbac1f8135a29c7fbb621/t/604aa3fa668a8e3b50630433/1615504379349/Mobile_Application_Profile.pdf\">Mobile Application Profile</a> provides a minimum set of commercial best practices for all cloud connected apps running on mobile devices.  This security baseline helps mitigate against common threats and reduces the probability of significant vulnerabilities.  The profile leverages existing standards and principles set forth by <a href=\"https://mobile-security.gitbook.io/masvs/\">OWASP MASVS</a> and the <strong><a href=\"https://vpntrust.net/\">VPN Trust Initiative</a></strong>, and allows developers to differentiate security capabilities around cryptography, authentication, network security, and vulnerability disclosure program quality. The profile also provides a framework to evaluate app category specific requirements which may be applied based on the features contained in the app. For example, an IoT app only needs to certify under the Mobile Application profile, whereas a VPN app must comply with the Mobile Application profile, plus the VPN extension.\n</p>\n<p>\nCertification allows developers to demonstrate product safety and we’re excited about the opportunity for this standard to push the industry forward. We observed that app developers were very quick to resolve any issues that were identified during their blackbox evaluations against this new standard, oftentimes with turnarounds in a matter of days. At launch, the following apps have been certified: <a href=\"https://compliance.ioxtalliance.org/product/157\">Comcast</a>, <a href=\"https://compliance.ioxtalliance.org/product/135\">ExpressVPN</a>, <a href=\"https://compliance.ioxtalliance.org/product/68\">GreenMAX</a>, <a href=\"https://compliance.ioxtalliance.org/product/174\">Hubspace</a>, <a href=\"https://compliance.ioxtalliance.org/product/173\">McAfee Innovations</a>, <a href=\"https://compliance.ioxtalliance.org/product/107\">NordVPN</a>, <a href=\"https://compliance.ioxtalliance.org/product/144\">OpenVPN for Android</a>, <a href=\"https://compliance.ioxtalliance.org/product/141\">Private Internet Access</a>, <a href=\"https://compliance.ioxtalliance.org/product/169\">VPN Private</a>, as well as the <a href=\"https://compliance.ioxtalliance.org/product/143\">Google One</a> app, including <a href=\"https://compliance.ioxtalliance.org/product/143\">VPN by Google One</a>.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe look forward to seeing adoption of the standard grow over time and for those app developers that are already investing in security best practices to be able to highlight their efforts. The standard also serves as a guiding light to inspire more developers to invest in mobile app security.
