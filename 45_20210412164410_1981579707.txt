It’s warming at least <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/why-the-arctic-is-warming-so-fast/\">twice as fast</a> as the rest of the planet, which is setting off vicious feedback loops that accelerate change. Ice, for instance, is more reflective than soil, so when it melts, the region absorbs more solar energy. More dark vegetation is <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/beautiful-yet-unnerving-photos-of-the-arctic-getting-greener/\">growing in northern lands</a>, absorbing still more of the sun’s heat. And when permafrost thaws, it releases gobs of greenhouse gases, which further warm the climate.</p>\n<p>The Arctic has gone so bizarro that lightning—a warm-weather phenomenon most common in the tropics—is now <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/why-lightning-strikes-in-an-arctic-gone-bizarro/\">striking near the North Pole</a>. And according to new modeling, the electrical bombardment of the region will only get worse. By the end of the century, the number of lightning strikes across the Arctic could more than double, which may initiate a shocking cascade of knock-on effects—namely, more wildfires and more warming. “The Arctic is a rapidly changing place, and this is an aspect of the transformation that I'm not sure has gotten a whole lot of attention, but it's actually really consequential,” says UCLA climate scientist Daniel Swain, who wasn’t involved in the research.</p>\n<p></p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1756004#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1756004&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=sFsfodXvLxE:9bIt--5vKGw:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=sFsfodXvLxE:9bIt--5vKGw:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=sFsfodXvLxE:9bIt--5vKGw:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=sFsfodXvLxE:9bIt--5vKGw:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=sFsfodXvLxE:9bIt--5vKGw:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=sFsfodXvLxE:9bIt--5vKGw:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 11 Apr 2021 10:45:39 +0000","feedId":45,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Science_sandra_angers-blondin_lightning_Qikiqtaruk-800x549.jpg","linkMd5":"793920051fe29e8733c9f2c6045c757f","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn16@2020_3/2021/04/12/16-43-23-984_f0e35b90485a3595.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":549,"sourceBytes":54162,"destBytes":44012,"author":"WIRED","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Science_sandra_angers-blondin_lightning_Qikiqtaruk-800x549.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn16@2020_3/2021/04/12/16-43-23-984_f0e35b90485a3595.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=sFsfodXvLxE:9bIt--5vKGw:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn23@2020_2/2021/04/12/16-44-09-695_d07835ca70ca176a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=sFsfodXvLxE:9bIt--5vKGw:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn4@2020_4/2021/04/12/16-44-09-140_78a6617c043ef104.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn12@2020_6/2021/04/12/16-44-09-175_f99fea21595d408b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn16@2020_2/2021/04/12/16-44-09-331_ca95730524b4751b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618245803257},{"createdTime":"2021-04-13 00:43:23","updatedTime":"2021-04-13 00:43:23","title":"Variant hunters race to find new strains where variant testing lags","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1755992","description":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n<figure class=\"intro-image intro-left\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/data-visualization-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"Genes are represented in multiple columns filled with differently colored lines.\"><p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/data-visualization.jpg\" class=\"enlarge-link\" data-height=\"1600\" data-width=\"2400\">Enlarge</a> (credit: <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"caption-link\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/editorial-images\">Marina Dekhnik | Getty Images</a>)</p>  </figure><div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>In mid-February, three travelers were stopped at the airport in Luanda, Angola. Even during the pandemic, the country, a hub for the oil industry, had seen plenty of passengers from Europe and South Africa, where two concerning variants of the virus that causes COVID-19 hold sway. But the strains weren’t yet circulating widely in Angola, so this winter, health officials battened down the hatches. Before any passports get stamped, travelers receive a rapid antigen test and wait 30 minutes for a result. A negative test means self-quarantine, followed by another test a few days later. A positive test means a two-week stay at a quarantine hotel. For the three travelers, it was option two.</p>\n<p>A few weeks later, samples taken from their noses arrived 2,000 miles south in South Africa, at the lab of Tulio de Oliveira, a geneticist at the University of KwaZulu-Natal. He was in for a surprise. The virus that had infected these three travelers didn’t resemble the strains circulating in most other places, including those labeled as “variants of concern” for their ability to spread faster and evade certain types of immunity. If those variants are like siblings, this one was more like a forgotten second cousin. It came from a lineage of the virus that emerged in the early days of the pandemic but had disappeared soon thereafter, apparently outcompeted by other variants. And yet here it was, a year later. And it had been busy. The virus had since accumulated dozens of mutations, including many of the same ones that made those other strains worrisome because of increased transmissibility and immune evasion. It had arrived at a similar genetic conclusion all on its own.</p>\n<h2>A scarcity of data</h2>\n<p></p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1755992#p3\">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1755992&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=3PwFJY9gguA:JyaKK-ToOac:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=3PwFJY9gguA:JyaKK-ToOac:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=3PwFJY9gguA:JyaKK-ToOac:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=3PwFJY9gguA:JyaKK-ToOac:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=3PwFJY9gguA:JyaKK-ToOac:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=3PwFJY9gguA:JyaKK-ToOac:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 10 Apr 2021 11:00:04 +0000","feedId":45,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/data-visualization-800x533.jpg","linkMd5":"b9ae1be84be93bc8dfde8031a3a240c1","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn13@2020_2/2021/04/12/16-43-23-940_ef5b7dce090e67a9.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":533,"sourceBytes":92016,"destBytes":48704,"author":"WIRED","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/data-visualization-800x533.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn13@2020_2/2021/04/12/16-43-23-940_ef5b7dce090e67a9.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=3PwFJY9gguA:JyaKK-ToOac:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn79@2020_6/2021/04/12/16-44-09-302_304bb9c6e388c853.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=3PwFJY9gguA:JyaKK-ToOac:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn19@2020_1/2021/04/12/16-44-09-220_fb545ef6150134e1.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn12@2020_6/2021/04/12/16-44-09-175_f99fea21595d408b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn16@2020_2/2021/04/12/16-44-09-331_ca95730524b4751b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618245803257},{"createdTime":"2021-04-13 00:43:23","updatedTime":"2021-04-13 00:43:23","title":"Six decades after Gagarin, nostalgia—and not much else—fuels Russia in space","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1756237","description":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n\n\n\n\n\n<div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n      <ul class=\"gallery shortcode-gallery gallery-wide\"><li>\n        <div class=\"gallery-item-content\">  \n        <div class=\"gallery-image\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/EywkMQ_XAAEo4He.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div>\n        <p>\n          The first photo of Yuri Gagarin after his historic spaceflight.

His ideas spread through the space-enthusiast community at a time when NASA was about to debut its space shuttle, which first flew in 1981. NASA had sold the vehicle as offering frequent, low-cost access to space.

In all, the authors of both reports suggest that more work needs to be done to understand SRM.</p>\n<h2>Greater cooperation</h2>\n<p>The idea has gained some traction. <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/07/bill-gates-funded-solar-geoengineering-could-help-stop-global-warming.html\">Bill Gates</a>, for example, advocated for it in 2019. The <a href=\"https://climate.envsci.rutgers.edu/GeoMIP/\">Geoengineering Model Intercomparison Project (GeoMIP) </a>has released more than 100 studies related to SRM in the decade since the group was formed. But recently, in response to public outcry, the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/02/climate/solar-geoengineering-block-sunlight.html\">Swedish Space Corporation</a> canceled a test flight that would help study SRM.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1755823#p3\">Read 19 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1755823&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=vozMla-1fJ8:LWxLwCmzwMk:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=vozMla-1fJ8:LWxLwCmzwMk:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=vozMla-1fJ8:LWxLwCmzwMk:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=vozMla-1fJ8:LWxLwCmzwMk:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=vozMla-1fJ8:LWxLwCmzwMk:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=vozMla-1fJ8:LWxLwCmzwMk:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 11 Apr 2021 13:30:17 +0000","feedId":45,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/1015076main_ISS005-E-19024-800x515.jpg","linkMd5":"df7edb538b0447fb7ef6d32f0478683a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn11@2020_1/2021/04/12/16-43-24-038_cf985e0aa525c34a.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":515,"sourceBytes":58975,"destBytes":33010,"author":"Ars Contributors","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/1015076main_ISS005-E-19024-800x515.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn11@2020_1/2021/04/12/16-43-24-038_cf985e0aa525c34a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=vozMla-1fJ8:LWxLwCmzwMk:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn84@2020_4/2021/04/12/16-44-09-293_a1c5c8b149f825d6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=vozMla-1fJ8:LWxLwCmzwMk:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn100@2020_1/2021/04/12/16-44-09-110_5e393b301e478e3f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn12@2020_6/2021/04/12/16-44-09-175_f99fea21595d408b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn16@2020_2/2021/04/12/16-44-09-331_ca95730524b4751b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618245803265}],"record":{"createdTime":"2021-04-13 00:43:23","updatedTime":"2021-04-13 00:43:23","feedId":45,"fetchDate":"Mon, 12 Apr 2021 16:43:23 +0000","fetchMs":238,"handleMs":2539,"totalMs":50291,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":20,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"30a0f3cd34b196db7a9217bddf515938","hostName":"us-016*","requestId":"96c2738891294752888ebc2112a5325a_45","contentType":"text/xml; charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":222572,"bgimgsTotal":5,"bgimgsGithubTotal":5,"articlesImgsTotal":17,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":17,"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx25":1,"myreaderx8":1,"myreaderx15":1,"myreaderx7":1,"myreaderx16":1,"myreaderx6":1,"myreaderx27":1,"myreaderx21":1,"myreaderx4":1,"myreaderx10":1,"myreaderx33":1,"myreaderx12":1,"myreaderx1":1,"myreaderx30":1,"myreaderx5oss":1,"myreaderx19":1,"myreaderx":1},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-05-30 17:21:38","updatedTime":"2020-09-01 09:23:41","id":45,"name":"Science – Ars Technica","url":"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/arstechnica/science","subscriber":null,"website":null,"icon":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/cropped-ars-logo-512_480-32x32.png","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx63/cdn40@2020_1/2020/09/01/01-23-39-453_5d81b97433efbdc7.png","description":"Serving the Technologist for more than a decade.
