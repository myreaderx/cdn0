Lots of great tips both in the comments and were sent to me privately. I'm still alternating meds, struggling at physical therapy every day, but I'm fortunate to have my wife (a medical/surgical nurse) here to tell me when it's supposed to hurt and when it's not. </p> <p>That said, BEFORE the pain started I had a nerve block in my neck and my right side was basically \"turned off\" for a week. It's definitely preferable to the current pain situation but one of the bright spots is that it give me extreme compassion for those who are missing or unable to use one or more limbs. </p> <p>I was hoping to use some of my convalescent time to play Xbox but I quickly discovered that it's VERY hard to play a FPS (first-person shooter) with one hand. Of course, tell an engineer that they can't do something and they'll just take it as a challenge, right?</p> <p>I happened to have an <a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://www.xbox.com/en-US/accessories/controllers/xbox-adaptive-controller\">Xbox Adaptive Controller</a> (I bought a few just in case I wanted to set up some relatives or new friends who might need one, never realizing it would be me that needed one) so I hooked it up and tried to figure out how I could game given my paralyzed arm and a lot of free time.</p> <p>The easiest and clearest way I can example the Xbox Adaptive Controller this - It's an Xbox Controller that pairs and talks to an Xbox like any other controller...but it's not a controller. </p> <p>It's an Xbox Adaptive Controller <strong>Construction Kit.</strong></p> <p>It has headphone jacks - just 1/8\" standard jacks - for every possible input, along with USB ports for Joysticks. You build - adapt - a controller that's ideal for you! It's magical.</p> <p>Then, combine it with built in Xbox software called <a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://support.xbox.com/en-us/help/account-profile/accessibility/copilot\">Copilot</a> and you can link two controllers so that two can play as one. I was able to use an a standard Xbox Controller in my left hand while using the Xbox Adaptive Controller with my feet. Within an hour I was playing Call of Duty quite competently, I might say. </p> <p>I even recorded it and put it in my YouTube so I have proof that I got at least one shot in during this round, LOL.</p> <center> <p> <div class=\"embed-container\"><iframe height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fjE4I1XNzRs\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"></iframe></div></center> <p>Go learn all about it, the Xbox Adaptive Controller is an extraordinary advice. Then go set it up for a friend or family member, they'll appreciate it very much.</p> <p><em>Please take a moment to </em><a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://www.youtube.com/shanselman\"><em>explore and <strong>subscribe </strong>to my YouTube</em></a><em>.

Then a nice comment will come in when someone listen to an episode years ago and is still thinking about particular quote or line.</p> <p>Last week I got an email asking about a blog post or podcast that I might have written, and the person wanted me to dig up the quote on a specific topic. It turns out it was from that podcast episode with Keavy. Keavy talks a lot about technical leadership on her blog and you should check it out.</p> <blockquote> <p>I recently added Transcripts to all 400 HOURS of the podcast and you <a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://app.podscribe.ai/embed/show-search/2017\">can search the entire 15 year episode archive in one place at Podscribe</a>!</p></blockquote> <p>One of the topics around leadership I've been thinking about a lot lately is how to make work a \"question friendly environment.\" You may hear the term \"safe space\" to refer to this kind of thing.</p> <blockquote> <p>\"We are missing out on valuable opportunities to connect and grow in our understanding of people if we aren’t giving one another permission to ask each other ignorant questions\" - from <a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://viewpoint.pointloma.edu/creating-a-safe-space-to-ask-ignorant-questions/\">Viewpoint</a></p></blockquote> <p>Some people come up at your later in career might say, \"you should just ask your question don't be a wimp.\" However, when we do this I think we forget what it was like to be just a few years out of school. You know you don't know anything, but you really don't know how much you don't know. </p> <p>In my opinion, the number one thing that we can do make more senior engineers, is to give the junior engineers a really good place to ask lots of <strike>dumb</strike> questions. That means replying to them with patience, providing them with resources to learn and explore, not scoffing or rolling our eyes. You too were once early in career, Dear Reader. Being given a place and permission to ask questions without judgment is a huge gift!</p> <h3>Permission to ask</h3> <p>As a manager, we need to explicitly offer the <strong>permission to ask.</strong> Talk about <a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://hbr.org/2019/04/make-your-meetings-a-safe-space-for-honest-conversation\">permission to ask questions up front</a>, and model that behavior so that others know it's OK. Make sure that folks know you're not going to \"flip the bozo bit\" just because someone asked a question about DNS. </p> <p>From <a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://www.amanet.org/articles/creating-a-question-friendly-environment/\">Scott Ginsberg</a>, <strong>If you want to build this type of environment, there are four key tasks ahead:</strong></p> <p>1. List the reasons why employees might (not) ask questions.\n<br>2. Maintain a question-friendly attitude.\n<br>3. Affirm your employees when they ask questions.\n<br>4. Reinforce a question-friendly environment.  <p>Make it so that questions can also be asked anonymously. Take their technical questions and consider them from their perspective. They may be missing historical context but they add a new diverse point of view or a fresh technical spin.</p> <p>What are you doing in your technical teams and at your company to make sure that folks feel they can ask technical questions without judgment?</p> <hr>  <p><strong>Sponsor: </strong>Suffering from a lack of clarity around software bugs?

So this little helper function:</p><pre class=\"brush: csharp; gutter: false; toolbar: false; auto-links: false;\">private StaticFileOptions GetStaticFileOptions()\n<br>{\n<br>    var p = new FileExtensionContentTypeProvider();\n<br>    p.Mappings[\".exe\"] = \"application/octet-stream\";\n<br>    return new StaticFileOptions { ContentTypeProvider = p };\n<br>}</pre>\n<p>and then you pass that StaticFileOptions class into UseStaticFiles.</p><pre class=\"brush: csharp; gutter: false; toolbar: false; auto-links: false;\">app.UseStaticFiles(GetStaticFileOptions());</pre>\n<p>Clearly a \"secure by default\" decision, but also one that's easily extended for my needs.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Sponsor: </strong>Suffering from a lack of clarity around software bugs?
