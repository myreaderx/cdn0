Initially, when I saw the open part-time position, I thought it was ideal for me as I had external commitments, and needed some sort of income. The job offers about 550USD per month (I don&#39;t live in the US, this is a rough conversion), but only required me to clock in about 90 hours a month.

I guess Eugene saw this as an advantage he could exploit later on during my employment. It is also important to note that Eugene would often ask about my well-being, how did I spent my weekends etc. At this point in time, it all seemed like courtesy talk so I didn&#39;t pay much attention to it.

Remember when I was inexperienced thus the payrate? Eugene had over a decade of experience in this expertise and he expected me to be at his level when I was only 3 months in. The stress was intense and I began working longer hours just to keep up and produce work at the best quality I could. I was under the belief that if I worked hard enough, my effort will speak.

At this point, I was beyond confused. Did he really not see the effort I put in? Was I delusional in thinking that I was actually doing well and my work had been improving? I tried speaking up but he quickly diverted the topic, telling me he knew the reason why my previous employer hated me. It was because I was lazy and uncommitted.

Eugene is obsessed with maximising his profits. Any business owner would love that, I agree, but Eugene is down to every cent in immoral and even possibly, illegal ways. He would sell a service to a client, and upon receiving the deposit, deliver something else.

While it is not exactly tax, it is obligated by law and negligence will result in a hefty fine and possibly jail time. These &#34;taxes&#34; are technically contributions for the employee&#39;s retirement funds, which is payable by every employer.

On the day that I left, I called in to check on my Contribution account and just as I had expected, Eugene hadn&#39;t paid a single cent over the past 4 months.

This jerk was playing dirty as a last attempt to steal from me. As I had mentioned, Eugene thought of himself as a smart man, and probably felt that the officer would rule the case in his favor since he had world-class convincing skills and his vague &#34;contract&#34; would have protected him either way.

Remember when I said employers are permitted to deduct a certain percentage from employee&#39;s wages? Due to his negligence, Eugene could no longer do that and had to pay the full amount, on top of the fines that incurred along with it. If he had dutifully abide by the law, it would had only costed him a third of what he had to pay.

But tail up is NOT seen in ANY cat species besides domestic cats, not even lions! Studies have indeed shown that cats are more likely to approach a silhouette with a tail up than one without, suggesting that yes, this is a signal cats use with one another to signify friendliness.

They were attracted by the rodent issue that emerged when humans first domesticated grain and wheat species. Cats became really big in ancient Egypt a few thousand years later and started living in big, social colonies.

In the last 10,000 years they have evolved into a completely social species, complete with their own unique signals. That&#39;s pretty amazing. And it shows us the conditions social behavior evolves and reasons why social behavior can be successful. Remember. there are 600 million cats in the world. 10,000 wildcats. 600 million domestic cats. They played the evolutionary game, and they won. Big time.

I start to think out loud. &#34;Selling the condo for around $150 to 200 thousand, and you&#39;re looking at houses in the $500 thousand range, so that&#39;s $650 to 700 thousand in total transactions.
