Today, I fear that yet another decade of malapportionment lies ahead, one that will shake the very democratic foundations of the nation.&#160;</p><p>In 2018, more than 60% of Missourians elected to turn a page on corruption. The <a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/Missouri_Amendment_1,_Lobbying,_Campaign_Finance,_and_Redistricting_Initiative_(2018)\">\"Clean Missouri\"</a> amendment ushered in a wave of reforms. The amendment placed stricter restrictions on gifts to members of the Missouri General Assembly, campaign finance contributions, and prevented former legislators from returning immediately to the State Capitol, only to serve as lobbyists. Most importantly, \"Clean Missouri\" established a nonpartisan office that would have been responsible for redistricting, instead of partisan politicians.&#160;</p><p>Almost as soon as the results were finalized, Republicans in Jefferson City began to <a href=\"https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/despite-election-night-victory-fight-over-ethics-overhaul-in-missouri/article_420965d6-af95-5529-9673-7d0f7cc8f0b3.html\">revolt</a>. Indeed, multiple state legislators opted to <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/26d6b65b2855496a90537b3a0bc29ce6\">resign</a> from their seats, rather than be subject to any rule that would have prevented them from becoming lobbyists. Those that stayed in the General Assembly began to chip away at the reforms.&#160;</p><p>Tricking the electorate, Republicans went to work repealing \"Clean Missouri,\" by proposing a new referendum \"for a cleaner Missouri.\" Instead of limiting corruption, however, this proposal re-politicized the redistricting process. The amendment was so absurd that former Republican US Senator John Danforth <a href=\"https://www.cleanmissouri.org/opponents/\">described</a> the effort as dangerous to \"the integrity of Missouri's democracy.\"&#160;</p><p>However, last week, in the narrowest of victories, Republican <a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/Missouri_Amendment_3,_Redistricting_Process_and_Criteria,_Lobbying,_and_Campaign_Finance_Amendment_(2020)\">succeeded</a>. Amendment 3 (\"Cleaner Missouri\")&#160; abolished the nonpartisan redistricting office, and altered the standards by which new districts maps were to be evaluated, re-opening the door to partisan gerrymandering. Even more troubling, the new amendment also <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/11/06/931908064/a-national-fight-over-who-is-counted-in-voting-districts-may-arise-from-missouri\">suggests</a> that non-citizens should not be included for redistricting purposes.&#160;</p><p>This move in Missouri and a wave of other measures proved that the biggest loser in last week's elections was not President Trump, but fair districts.&#160;</p><h2>A 10-year shift</h2><p>Outside of Missouri, GOP-led gerrymandering led to brutal results for Democrats and worrying signs for the integrity of our democracy.</p><p>In Ohio, despite winning more than 45% of the vote, Democrats will be stuck with just 25% of the congressional seats. Most egregiously, Hamilton County (the Cincinnati area), which voted for Biden by more than 15 points, will be represented by a Republican in the House of Representatives. In fact, Cincinnati is the largest metro area in the country not represented by a Democrat in Congress. This is the result of a 2011 gerrymander. With total control of the state government, Republicans <a href=\"https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/politics/2019/05/03/ohio-congressional-map-gerrymandered-court-says/39441003/\">drew</a> a district map that split Cincinnati in half, smothering the urban Democratic electorate with Republican voters in exurban and rural communities.&#160;</p><p>In order to prevent a repeat of last decade's unfair maps, Democrats needed only to win two seats on the Ohio Supreme Court, providing a check and balance against the Republican dominated legislature and commission. But Democratic nominee <a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/Ohio_Supreme_Court_elections,_2020\">John P. O'Donnell </a>came up short, leaving Republicans with a 4 to 3 majority on the court. As a result of his loss, Ohio will remain a state where the will of voters is not reflected in their elected officials.&#160;</p><p>In Kansas, President-elect Biden became the first Democrat to win the state's most populous county — Johnson (home to the Kansas City suburbs), in more than 100 years. With such a strong performance at the top of the ticket, Kansas Democrats had hoped to gain at least one seat in the State House. With one more state representative, Democrats would have broken Republicans' supermajority in the State Legislature and guaranteed fair maps. But instead, Republicans picked up three seats.</p><p>Currently, there is one Democratic congressional district in Kansas, anchored in Johnson County. The seat, which was flipped in 2018 by Democratic Rep. Sharice Davids is emblematic of the suburban, educated shift towards Democrats. Empowered by their super-majorities, however, Kansas GOP leaders will now attempt to <a href=\"https://www.cjonline.com/opinion/20201019/editorial-redistricting-shouldnrsquot-be-partisan\">erase</a> David's seat, cracking it in either half or thirds.&#160;</p><p>While the outlook in Missouri, Ohio, and Kansas is surely disappointing for the prospects of fair districts in the coming decade, there was no state with more disheartening election results than Texas.&#160;</p><p>Democrats have long dreamed of flipping the Lone Star State. And this year, it seemed possible. More important than the presidential race, Democrats had a chance to capture the Texas State House. With the chamber, they would have had the power to veto a district plan that favored Republicans in the nation's second largest state.&#160;</p><p>The current congressional map in Texas is already one of the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/10/03/upshot/how-the-new-math-of-gerrymandering-works-supreme-court.html\">most</a> gerrymandered in the country. Just as Ohio Republicans cracked the Cincinnati arena in half, the Texas map similarly <a href=\"https://spectrumlocalnews.com/tx/san-antonio/election/2020/10/06/a-brief-history-of-texas-gerrymandering-\">snakes</a> around urban areas, splits cities, and drags districts for dozens of miles with no purpose other than ensuring Republican supremacy. Sadly, this will persist for another decade, as Republicans retained control of all three branches of the state government.&#160;</p><p>Outside of these four states, the picture is equally grim. Next year, Republicans will be in a position to draw unfair maps in more than 40% of US House seats, while most large Democratic-leaning states (such as New York, New Jersey, California) have non-partisan or bipartisan processes. This discrepancy will only be made worse by a right-wing federal judiciary that is <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/576/13-1314/\">hostile</a> to independent redistricting commissions (found in Arizona, Colorado, and Michigan), and refuses to <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/2017/16-1161\">limit</a> partisan gerrymandering.&#160;&#160;</p><p>Despite winning a majority of congressional votes this year, Democrats only narrowly held the House of Representatives, in part, due the lasting effects of 2011's gerrymander. One can only imagine that in 2022, Democrats will face an even steeper uphill battle, in the wake of newer, more precise Republican-biased maps. Instead of delivering a progressive victory, the 2020 election likely cemented Republican minority rule for the foreseeable future.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/republicans-2020-election-gerrymandering-redistricting-district-democrats-states-2020-11'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=BxlDKSsC_rg:H14ORGjITd4:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=BxlDKSsC_rg:H14ORGjITd4:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=BxlDKSsC_rg:H14ORGjITd4:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=BxlDKSsC_rg:H14ORGjITd4:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=BxlDKSsC_rg:H14ORGjITd4:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=BxlDKSsC_rg:H14ORGjITd4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=BxlDKSsC_rg:H14ORGjITd4:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=BxlDKSsC_rg:H14ORGjITd4:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/BxlDKSsC_rg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 16 Nov 2020 02:34:00 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5fad51094044a00018f7628f?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"29b3838b3dad6464ac7a62bdf8a4046d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn12@2020_1/2020/11/16/07-09-57-425_553aa5b81eff4f72.webp","destWidth":1778,"destHeight":1333,"sourceBytes":119856,"destBytes":119856,"author":"insider@insider.com (Zachariah Sippy)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5fad510d8a86ff001880b264?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn80@2020_4/2020/11/16/07-09-57-447_c509de86cb4c57fa.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn95@2020_1/2020/11/16/07-09-59-632_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=BxlDKSsC_rg:H14ORGjITd4:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn75@2020_6/2020/11/16/07-09-59-517_a54be53bbe9cf8e5.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=BxlDKSsC_rg:H14ORGjITd4:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn92@2020_3/2020/11/16/07-09-58-511_a965d42f0a9a9109.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn71@2020_2/2020/11/16/07-09-59-345_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=BxlDKSsC_rg:H14ORGjITd4:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn64@2020_3/2020/11/16/07-10-00-696_17c83144799fe7dc.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/BxlDKSsC_rg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn63@2020_6/2020/11/16/07-09-59-240_06fdf1774fd9601d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605510595663},{"createdTime":"2020-11-16 15:09:55","updatedTime":"2020-11-16 15:09:55","title":"Astronauts brought a Baby Yoda toy on board SpaceX's Crew Dragon spaceship before it launched into orbit","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/spacex-nasa-astronauts-launched-baby-yoda-doll-crew-dragon-spaceship-2020-11","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5e4ef896f0201413051e31ce?format=jpeg\" alt=\"baby yoda toy hasbro disney.JPG\" height=\"2000\" width=\"3000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>A Baby Yoda doll from &#34;The Mandalorian&#34; show in the Star Wars franchise.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Craig Barritt/Getty Images for Disney</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>SpaceX <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/spacex-crew-1-mission-timeline-nasa-astronaut-launch-2020-11\">launched four astronauts into orbit</a> for NASA on Sunday, and the crew is headed to the International Space Station.</li>\n<li>The astronauts brought a secret companion onto their Crew Dragon spaceship: a baby Yoda doll from \"The Mandalorian.\"</li>\n<li>It's now a SpaceX tradition to bring a \"zero-gravity indicator\" toy aboard spaceship launches.

China, Russia, Iran and North Korea all loom large, right alongside climate change and the still-worsening coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>Yet with a persistently polarized American electorate and a possibly divided Congress, it will be hard for his administration to make significant progress on the biggest security challenges facing the United States. Whatever happens with the messy transition period leading up to Biden's inauguration on January 20, the Republican Party's obstructionism and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/defense-department-election-transition/2020/11/10/5a173e60-2371-11eb-8599-406466ad1b8e_story.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Donald Trump's decapitation of Pentagon leadership this week</a> certainly will not help.</p><p>There are, however, some easy wins that Biden's administration could still conceivably secure within its first 100 days, without having to charge straight into major political headwinds.</p><p>Despite the many obstacles Biden's national security team will confront, there are nevertheless viable options to deliver quickly on <a href=\"https://www.dw.com/en/biden-pledges-to-restore-us-global-cooperation-and-leadership-but-can-he/a-55537506\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Biden's promise to \"restore American leadership abroad\" and repair international alliances</a>.</p><p>A Biden White House could better the odds for more stable US relations with the world by taking three simple steps in the first quarter of 2021 to demonstrate America's recommitment to the defense of human rights and promotion of international legal norms.

The Trump administration's decision to <a href=\"https://www.dw.com/en/us-sanctions-icc-chief-prosecutor-fatou-bensouda/a-54796337\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">impose a travel ban on The Hague court's top prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda</a>, and members of her staff is a stain on America's long track record of support for international justice. The <a href=\"https://www.icc-cpi.int/resource-library/documents/rs-eng.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Rome Statute</a> that established the ICC as the global court of last resort for war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide and crimes of aggression grew directly out of the legal traditions established by American prosecutors at the Nuremberg Trials of Nazi officials in Germany after World War II.</p><p>Trump's former national security adviser, John Bolton, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo broke with that tradition by singling out Bensouda and members of her team and barring them from entering the United States. It was punishment from the Trump administration after the <a href=\"https://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/articles/28599/what-a-war-crimes-investigation-means-for-the-icc-afghanistan-and-the-u-s\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ICC granted Bensouda's request to open a formal investigation</a> into war crimes committed in Afghanistan by all sides, including American forces.</p><p>While the US is highly unlikely to ever join as a full state party to the Rome Statute, the incoming administration would do well to reestablish the long-standing norm of noninterference in the ICC's affairs. Biden needs to ensure that his administration steers far clear of personalizing its policy positions by targeting people who have been hired by international institutions like the ICC to do the hard work of pursuing accountability and justice. Anything short of a full restoration of travel visas for the ICC staff and protection of rights guaranteed under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations will only add insult to the Trump administration's injury of the ICC's mandate.</p><p>Normalizing relations with Bensouda's office and reengaging the ICC will go a long way toward demonstrating to the Rome Statute's 120-plus signatory nations that the U.S. respects the sovereign decision of each country to engage with the court. An added bonus is that it will make moot <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/11/trump-icc-us-war-crimes-investigation-sanctions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Trump's unconstitutional attempt to bar American citizens</a> or anyone else from providing expert advice to the ICC, while perhaps reducing the amount of political capital and taxpayer dollars that will have to be spent on a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/oct/01/human-rights-lawyers-sue-trump-administration-for-silencing-them\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">currently pending federal civil suit</a> on the issue.</p><p>To ensure that America is not blindsided by ICC action where the Afghanistan investigation is concerned, the new administration also needs to ensure that relations with the tribunal in The Hague remain stable and communication channels open. That will require a different approach to how the State Department's Office of Global Criminal Justice is run, and the appointment of someone with both a sharp legal mind and experience with leading teams who have come under political pressure. Also known as the GCJ, the State Department's chief liaison office to the ICC and other international courts is an important node in the network of US national security players that can influence questions of international justice. The GCJ has historically played a pivotal role in supporting international war crimes tribunals, <a href=\"https://2001-2009.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2006/68192.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">including the trial of Liberia's former president, Charles Taylor</a>.</p><p>It may be that there are already several qualified candidates inside the State Department who might want to take the position. It is also probably the case that, after four years of the Trump administration sidelining human rights and international justice issues, there is a diverse pool of candidates who have been cooling their heels outside of government and would jump at a chance to lead the revival of American support for international justice. Whoever takes up the job, all that matters is that they understand that they will need to staff their new team with experts who are intimately familiar with the Afghanistan portfolio, because that issue is not going away any time soon.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5813cd50362ca4892e8b5775?format=jpeg\" alt=\"United Nations\" height=\"3026\" width=\"5595\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The United Nations.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Bebeto Matthews/AP Photo</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p><strong>Step Two:</strong> Choose a current career Foreign Service officer to represent the US at the United Nations instead of a political appointee. This is possibly a tougher political sell, but doable. Successive presidents have treated the top UN job as more of a political plum for loyal party soldiers, big personalities and deep-pocketed campaign donors. But, with climate change, a global pandemic and heated rivalries with Russia and China all in play at the UN Security Council, this is no time to appoint a prima donna.</p><p>Plus, a hostile, Republican-dominated Senate almost guarantees a fight over the UN appointment. To increase the chances that experience, not politics, will guide American action at the UN, and to reduce the odds of a protracted battle over the appointment, Biden should select from the existing roster of senior American diplomats.</p><p>Moreover, elevating someone from within the ranks of America's demoralized diplomatic corps would forcefully demonstrate Biden's commitment to reenergizing American diplomacy after the damage Trump has done.</p><p>To show that his administration also means business about racial equity, Biden could send a strong message about its intent to diversify the State Department by tapping one of the many talented women affiliated with the Leadership Council on Women in National Security for the UN job, and heeding the <a href=\"https://www.lcwins.org/initiatives\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">council's sage advice</a> about how to get diversity and inclusion right.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5a6b5510cf84101f008b4c0f?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Nikki Haley\" height=\"1333\" width=\"2000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Nikki Haley.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Drew Angerer/Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p><strong>Step Three:</strong> Rejoin the UN Human Rights Council and appoint as council representative a seasoned human rights defender. This is a cost-free no brainer. <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/44537372\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Trump administration's decision two years ago to quit the council</a> fell in line with neoconservative Republican views that the US should not participate in a process it can't dominate.</p><p>Nikki Haley, the American ambassador to the UN at the time, said the council was run by notorious human rights violators who often made biased claims against the United States. George W. Bush's administration made a similar case when it boycotted the council in 2006.</p><p>As with the UN Human Rights Commission that the council replaced, there are certainly reasons to be critical of an international body that has on occasion seen countries like China, Russia or Cuba lead its periodic review of human rights violations around the world. Shouting complaints from outside the council, however, is unlikely to do much to precipitate change.</p><p>The next White House needs to show it wants to get back in the game by rejoining the council and the world, so it should stick with picking the lowest hanging fruit first.</p><p><em>Candace Rondeaux is a senior fellow and professor of practice at the Center on the Future of War, a joint initiative of New America and Arizona State University.

href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/spacex-launches-rocket-mission-nasa-astronauts-crew-1-dragon-spaceship-2020-11\">carried the company's first operational human mission for NASA into orbit</a>. The crew consists of three NASA astronauts — Shannon Walker, Mike Hopkins, and Victor Glover — as well as Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency astronaut Soichi Noguchi.</p><p>The astronauts' Crew Dragon spaceship is set to dock to the International Space Station on Monday night, where NASA astronaut Kathleen Rubins and two Russian cosmonauts, Sergey Ryzhikov and Sergey Kud-Sverchkov, will be waiting to greet them.</p><p>The mission, called Crew-1, calls for the astronauts to stay on the ISS for the standard six months. During that time, they'll conduct spacewalks, do science experiments, and work on regular station maintenance. Since humans haven't launched from US soil since the Space Shuttle Program — which flew missions that lasted just a couple weeks — this will be the longest human spaceflight in NASA's history.</p><p>Meet the crew.</p><h2>Mike Hopkins, commander</h2><p><strong><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f28846624381726c2556896?format=jpeg\" alt=\"michael &#34;mike&#34; hopkins NASA\" height=\"531\" width=\"800\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Astronaut Mike Hopkins stows items in a locker in the Destiny laboratory of the International Space Station.\n<p class=\"copyright\">NASA</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></strong></p><p>Hopkins grew up on a farm in Missouri. Before becoming a NASA astronaut in 2009, he was a special assistant to the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. A colonel in the Air Force, he served as a flight test engineer.&#160;</p><p>This is Hopkins' second trip to space. He first went to the ISS in September 2013 as a member of Expedition 37/38. During that mission, Hopkins logged 166 days in space and conducted two spacewalks.</p><p>\"I can't wait to get to float again,\" he told Business Insider.&#160;</p><p>Hopkins was announced as a Crew-1 member in 2018. As commander, he's tasked with ensuring that the mission runs smoothly. That includes making a sacrifice: The ISS is currently short one crew quarters, so Hopkins may have to sleep on SpaceX's Crew Dragon spacecraft, Resilience, which will remain docked to the ISS. Eventually, however, a sleeping pod is expected to be sent to the station on a cargo mission.</p><p>\"The nerves start to really pile on as you get closer to launch,\" Hopkins said during a pre-mission news conference.&#160;</p><h2>Victor Glover, pilot</h2><p><strong><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f297bc058c24d451f1dd88c?format=jpeg\" alt=\"victor glover NASA crew dragon selected\" height=\"959\" width=\"1279\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>NASA astronaut Victor Glover cheers after being selected to fly on the second crewed mission of SpaceX&#39;s new Crew Dragon spaceship, August 3, 2018.\n<p class=\"copyright\">David J. Phillip/AP</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></strong></p><p>Glover is the only Crew-1 member who hadn't flown in space before, but he had logged more than 3,000 hours of flying experience on Earth. Like Hopkins, he was selected as a Crew-1 member in 2018. He's the mission's pilot.</p><p>\"I really look forward to every single bit of it,\" he told Business Insider. \"Every time I do something in space, it will be the first time.\"</p><p>Glover became part of NASA's 21st astronaut class in 2013, while serving as a Legislative Fellow in the US Senate. He is also a former Navy commander, aviator, and test pilot.&#160;</p><p>Glover and his wife, who both hail from California, have four children. As the Crew-1 mission approached, their family had to be careful about their behavior during the pandemic, he said.</p><p>\"We've essentially been isolating since mid-March,\" Glover said. \"They're ready for me to go, one because they want to see their father accomplish one of his lifelong dreams, but they also really want to go back to school and have a chance to see their friends and go to the mall.\"</p><h2>Shannon Walker, mission specialist — and trailblazer</h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5faeece11c741f0019ac9c4a?format=jpeg\" alt=\"shannon walker nasa astronaut spacex spacesuit portrait crew 1 dragon spaceship mission KSC 20200814 PH SPX01_0002 orig\" height=\"1800\" width=\"2400\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>NASA astronaut Shannon Walker in a space suit.\n<p class=\"copyright\"><a href=\"https://images.nasa.gov/details-KSC-20200814-PH-SPX01_0002\" target=\"_blank\">SpaceX</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Walker, a mission specialist, was born in Houston, Texas.

She spent 161 days on the space station in 2010.&#160;</p><p>She was assigned to the Crew-1 mission in February of this year. With the Crew-1 launch, she became the first woman to fly to space in a commercial spacecraft.</p><p>\"To be honest, I haven't really put much thought into the fact that I am the first woman on a commercial vehicle,\" Walker told Business Insider. \"I expect to be the first of many, and look forward to the day that we don't have to note such events.\"</p><p>Ahead of the launch, Walker — who is married to astronaut Andy Thomas — said she was looking forward to having a 360-degree view of Earth again.</p><p>\"In some ways, it's the start of all those science-fiction movies that we watched as kids coming to fruition where you've got entities living and working out in space and off the planet,\" she said. \"Just to be at the forefront of that is enormously exciting.\"</p><h2>Soichi Noguchi, mission specialist — and a spaceflight veteran</h2><p><strong><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f74b6bf74fe5b0018a8e419?format=jpeg\" alt=\"shannon walker nasa astronaut spacex spacesuit training crew 1 dragon spaceship mission KSC 20200924 PH SPX01_0004_orig\" height=\"2000\" width=\"3000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>JAXA astronaut Soichi Noguchi participates in equipment testing for the Crew-1 mission at SpaceX headquarters.\n<p class=\"copyright\"><a href=\"https://images.nasa.gov/details-KSC-20200924-PH-SPX01_0004\" target=\"_blank\">SpaceX</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></strong></p><p>Noguchi, also a mission specialist, is an aeronautical engineer from Japan. A former Boy Scout, he was selected as an astronaut in 1996 and has spent 177 days in space.</p><p>Like Walker, he was also appointed to the Crew-1 mission in 2020. He is the team's only non-NASA member, and the fifth Japanese astronaut to fly in space.</p><p>Noguchi was on the US Space Shuttle in 2005 and a Russian Soyuz expedition in 2009.

The same thing should happen with the following mission, Crew-3: It's expected to launch in September 2021, so should tag up with Crew-2 in orbit.</p><p>SpaceX, meanwhile, is also hard at work on another launch vehicle called Starship.
