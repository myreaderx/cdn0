Today, we&#8217;re watching a video that explores how Get Out exemplifies Hannah Arendt&#8217;s theory on the Banality of Evil.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Any fan of horror movies is inevitably asked to account for their depraved taste. Why, after all, would anyone want to watch mutilations, masked murderers, and unsettling displays of the macabre, let alone take comfort in it?</p>\n<p>Everyone has their own answer. But I do think there are two truths at the heart of why so many of us feel an attraction to the genre. The first is that, not unlike sci-fi, horror has an uncanny ability to call out terrifying things about the real-world in a way that feels controlled, safe, and contained. It depicts and dramatizes nightmares like abduction, home invasion, and body horror in ways that you can wrap your head around.</p>\n<p>The second is that no matter how socially aware they may be, horror movies will always pale in comparison to the horrifying truth about real-world evil. Namely: that it is dangerously and insidiously normal-looking. Evil is something banal and every-day. It is complacency for bad behavior that, by virtue of being normalized, no longer registers as such. Evil in the real world is a dangerous lack of thought. It&#8217;s a weaponized complacency. As such, diving into fictional worlds where you can pick villains out of a line-up is reassuring. This is a comforting fantasy of horror: that evil is obvious and that it (usually) can be defeated.</p>\n<p>The concept of &#8220;the banality of evil&#8221; was conceptualized by <strong>Hannah Arendt</strong> during her coverage of the trial of Adolf Eichmann, one of the major organizers of the Holocaust. Arendt was struck and horrified by Eichmann&#8217;s ordinariness. This boring bureaucrat thoughtlessly oversaw systematic genocide. And the implication is horrifying: that evil, real evil, often appears under the guise of ubiquity. This is the horror at the root of all systemic oppression, including the ingrained objectification and oppression of Black people perpetrated by white supremacy.</p>\n<p>As the video essay below explains, Jordan Peele&#8217;s 2014 horror film <em><strong>Get Out</strong> </em>not only confronts the normalized conventions of its own genre but the horror underlying the normalized oppression of Black people. The video essay teases out how <em>Get Out </em>echoes Arendt&#8217;s banality of evil theory and unpacks how Peele uses the expectations of the genre to dramatize the horrific normalcy of real-world evil.</p>\n<p>Watch &#8220;<strong>Peele&#8217;s <em>Get Out</em> and The Banality of Evil</strong>&#8220;:</p>\n<p><iframe title=\"Peele&#039;s Get Out and The Banality of Evil\" width=\"700\" height=\"394\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/itI2y1cn4qU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Who made this?</h2>\n<p><b>The Movement Image</b> is a film journal edited by <strong>Grant Kerber</strong> and <strong>Paul Ebenkamp</strong>.

This entry looks into how rear projection works.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>If you’ve seen a film from before the 1970s, there’s a very good chance you’ve already encountered <strong>rear projection</strong>. And if you’ve seen a film from before the 1970s with two people talking in a moving car, there’s a one-hundred-percent chance you’ve already encountered rear projection.</p>\n<p>The concept is simple: Can’t shoot on real locations? No problem! Want to record on-set dialogue while your actors outrun the cops in a noisy convertible? Don’t worry! It’s as easy (in theory) as a sound stage and a projector.</p>\n<p>At its advent in the 1930s, rear projection was a game-changing technology. It gave filmmakers more control, consistency, and creative freedom to shoot <i>what</i> they wanted <i>where</i> they wanted. And yet, while rear projection’s in-camera process effectively streamlined production workflows, it regularly failed to achieve any sense of naturalism.</p>\n<p>Rear projection is, against its technicians’ best efforts, far from an invisible effect. Despite being the standard compositing technique for decades, with a few exceptions, rear projection never achieved a level of perfection such that its presence could go unnoticed. When there&#8217;s rear projection on the screen, it&#8217;s hard to overlook.</p>\n\n<img width=\"128\" height=\"96\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/To-Catch-a-Thief-rear-projection.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" alt=\"To Catch A Thief Rear Projection\" loading=\"lazy\" type=\"rectangular\" columns=\"2\" link=\"none\" ids=\"357232,357231,357229,357236\" orderby=\"post__in\" include=\"357232,357231,357229,357236\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/To-Catch-a-Thief-rear-projection.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/To-Catch-a-Thief-rear-projection-768x576.jpg 768w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/To-Catch-a-Thief-rear-projection-160x120.jpg 160w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/To-Catch-a-Thief-rear-projection-320x240.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 128px) 100vw, 128px\" />\n<img width=\"128\" height=\"96\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Dr.-No-rear-projection.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" alt=\"Dr No Rear Projection\" loading=\"lazy\" type=\"rectangular\" columns=\"2\" link=\"none\" ids=\"357232,357231,357229,357236\" orderby=\"post__in\" include=\"357232,357231,357229,357236\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Dr.-No-rear-projection.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Dr.-No-rear-projection-768x576.jpg 768w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Dr.-No-rear-projection-160x120.jpg 160w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Dr.-No-rear-projection-320x240.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 128px) 100vw, 128px\" />\n<img width=\"128\" height=\"96\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Airplane-rear-projection.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" alt=\"Airplane!

Over time, traditional rear projection morphed from a practical necessity to an expressive tool, a technique employed by stylish directors to revere or ridicule the past. Others have employed rear projection&#8217;s &#8220;off-ness&#8221; to convey a sense of unreality and unease, as with Neo&#8217;s first trip into <strong>The Matrix</strong> or Dr. Bill wandering the streets at night in <strong><em>Eyes Wide Shut</em></strong>.</p>\n<p>While rear projection as it was originally conceived may have fallen out of fashion, good ideas always find a way to adapt and survive. So here we are, almost a century later, and despite all odds, rear projection is making a comeback. Here’s everything you’ve ever wanted to know about how rear projection works, where it came from, and where it’s going:</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>How&#8217;d they do that?</h2>\n<h3>Long story short:</h3>\n<p>By projecting an image onto a screen from behind and then staging foreground action against its backdrop. The result, when photographed, is an in-camera composite.</p>\n<h3>Long story long:</h3>\n<p>Rear projection (a.k.a. <strong>process photography</strong>) was the primary special effects composite technology in Hollywood from the mid-1930s to the early 1970s. At its most basic, rear projection is composed of four components: a projector, a screen, foreground subjects, and a camera. The subjects are placed between the camera and the screen while a projector positioned on the other side of the screen projects pre-recorded footage or a still image. Typically, the aesthetic objective of rear projection is to create the illusion that the subjects are not on a sound stage. The technical objective is to make production more streamlined, safer, and consistent.</p>\n<p>Rear projection background footage is called a “<strong>plate</strong>.” If you’ve heard someone yell “roll plate!” on a movie set &#8212; or a fictional depiction of a movie set &#8212; they’re basically shouting, &#8220;Fire up the projector!&#8221; When the projected background is in motion, it’s a “<strong>process shot</strong>.” If the background is a still image, it’s referred to as a “<strong>transparency shot</strong>.”</p>\n<p>If your only experience with projectors is of the front-facing variety, you may be wondering: how does the light pass-through and stick on the screen? The short answer is that rear and front projection use different kinds of screens. Front projection uses an opaque reflective screen, which bounces light back. Rear projection uses a translucent screen that allows light to pass through while transmitting the light across its surface.</p>\n<p>For the rear projection process to work, several holistic details have to be taken into consideration. For one thing: because the screen and the camera are fixed in place, all motion and angles must be accounted for by the rear projection photography team in advance. In other words: every movement and angle in principal photography must be carefully planned before the footage for the plate is shot.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-357239 alignnone\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Psycho-rear-projection-2.jpg\" alt=\"Psycho Rear Projection\" width=\"934\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Psycho-rear-projection-2.jpg 934w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Psycho-rear-projection-2-768x493.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 934px) 100vw, 934px\" /></p>\n<p>The lack of Steadicam technology made this easier said than done. Matching the lighting on the soundstage to that of the plate is also critical. If the plate depicts a cloudless day and the actors are in shadow, the illusion will not work. Synchronizing the frame rates of the camera and the projector was also important. If one of the apertures was open while the other was closed, optical artifacts (like halos of light) would appear in the background plate and ruin the effect.</p>\n<p>As Julie Turnock outlines in her essay “<a href=\"https://the.hitchcock.zone/wiki/Cinema_Journal_(2012)_-_The_Screen_on_the_Set:_The_Problem_of_Classical-Studio_Rear_Projection\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Screen on the Set</a>,” one surprisingly prevalent misconception about rear projection is that it is basically an old-timey predecessor of blue screen and green screen compositing. It’s true that the two techniques share similar aesthetic purposes. Namely: opening up the possibility of where and how filmmakers can shoot their subjects. But ultimately, both approaches have very different on-set and post-production specifications.</p>\n<p>During its heyday, rear projection’s major advantage over other compositing techniques was its efficiency. The process could be completed immediately on-set at the same time as principal photography. It could also be shot in the presence of the key filmmakers and performers and assessed promptly in the dailies. Meanwhile, blue and green screen compositing is a part of a wider set of techniques that historically fall under the auspices of traveling mattes or “opticals.&#8221;</p>\n<p>There is a crucial difference between optical composites and process photography: the bulk of the work for the former falls to post-production, while that of the latter takes place in-camera. The technical requirements of rear projection controlled many aspects of production, from blocking to mise-en-scène. And that sat just fine with the Henry Ford-ified conveyor belt of Old Hollywood.</p>\n\n<img width=\"128\" height=\"96\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/North-By-Northwest-Rear-projection-1.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" alt=\"North By Northwest Rear Projection\" loading=\"lazy\" type=\"rectangular\" columns=\"2\" link=\"none\" ids=\"357243,357244\" orderby=\"post__in\" include=\"357243,357244\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/North-By-Northwest-Rear-projection-1.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/North-By-Northwest-Rear-projection-1-768x576.jpg 768w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/North-By-Northwest-Rear-projection-1-160x120.jpg 160w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/North-By-Northwest-Rear-projection-1-320x240.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 128px) 100vw, 128px\" />\n<img width=\"128\" height=\"96\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/From-Russia-With-Love-rear-projection.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" alt=\"From Russia With Love Rear Projection\" loading=\"lazy\" type=\"rectangular\" columns=\"2\" link=\"none\" ids=\"357243,357244\" orderby=\"post__in\" include=\"357243,357244\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/From-Russia-With-Love-rear-projection.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/From-Russia-With-Love-rear-projection-768x576.jpg 768w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/From-Russia-With-Love-rear-projection-160x120.jpg 160w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/From-Russia-With-Love-rear-projection-320x240.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 128px) 100vw, 128px\" />\n\n<p>In a fun twist. while conceptually rear projection is easy enough to explain and understand, in practice it&#8217;s very difficult to pull off in a subtle, seamless way. When people say “rear projection looks bad” they are usually talking about the same thing. Namely: that the technique tends to produce a visible difference between the foreground action and the rear projection footage.</p>\n<p>Rear projection tends to look, in a word, “fake.” A part of the reason for this is that there is usually a discrepancy in the quality of the foreground action and the projected image. The characteristically washed-out, desaturated look of the projection is the result of a number of factors. These include print quality and projectors incapable of producing an image of sufficient brilliance.</p>\n<p>There were fixes over the years, from fine-grain VistaVision film stock and more powerful projector bulbs. But a reliable methodology for eliminating the degraded image quality in the re-photographed plates never came through. As Turnock puts it: &#8220;rear projection was, in sum, perfectly consistent with the Hollywood studio production system, but not with its ideal seamless aesthetic.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Front projection, the <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/blade-runner-eyes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">first mainstream use</a> of which was in<i> 2001: A Space Odyssey</i>, solved a number of the problems of rear projection. The process involves carefully angled mirrors that allow the projected image to align with the camera&#8217;s focal angle and appear on a highly reflective screen, in-camera. The main motive for using front over rear projection is a noted improvement in image quality. Which, it turns out, makes all the difference.</p>\n<p>As front projection and optical compositing became more affordable and accessible, rear projection became increasingly obsolete. There are very few directors today who earnestly never gave up on process photography, however. One of them is <strong>James Cameron</strong>.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_357240\" style=\"width: 810px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-357240\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-357240 size-full\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Terminator-2-rear-projection.gif\" alt=\"Terminator Rear Projection\" width=\"800\" height=\"333\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Terminator-2-rear-projection.gif 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Terminator-2-rear-projection-768x320.gif 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-357240\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Didn&#8217;t know there was vehicular rear projection in &#8216;Terminator 2,&#8217; did you?</p></div>\n<p>But, thanks to improved equipment, rear projection is back with a vengeance. For directors intent on shooting as much in-camera as possible, the promise of rear projection is enticing. Cutting edge technology like high-contrast 4K laser projectors have all but eliminated the distracting fidelity issues of film-based rear projection.</p>\n<p>Not only is digital, pre-rendered, and real-time media able to achieve full photorealistic in-camera results, but filmmakers are also now able to add interactively cued elements at a moment&#8217;s notice. In addition to looking fantastic, live projection has the added benefit of giving the performers and the camera department something tangible to work with.</p>\n<p>Joseph Kosinski&#8217;s <strong><i>Oblivion </i></strong><a href=\"https://youtu.be/9DCkIuv82Q4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">used front projection</a> to convey an encompassing sky that reflects off spaceships and into its actors’ eyes. Alfonso Cuarón&#8217;s <strong><i>Gravity</i></strong> <a href=\"https://youtu.be/OXpKvFwDOF4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">placed its performers</a> in the “Light Box,” a room full of LED screens that projected moving images onto their faces allowing animators to composite them perfectly.</p>\n<p>And then there’s <strong>StageCraft </strong>(a.k.a. &#8220;The Volume&#8221;), a process Industrial Light &#38; Magic honed in <strong><i>Rogue One: A Star Wars Story</i></strong> that uses a ginormous curved wall of LED screens powered by the Unreal Engine allowing for real-time display. The result is a virtual environment that can be rendered in real-time in the perspective of the camera.</p>\n<p>The latest <em>Star Wars </em>project to use StageCraft is the Disney+ series <em><strong>The Mandalorian. </strong></em>And as executive producer Jon Favreau <a href=\"https://ascmag.com/articles/the-mandalorian\">muses in <em>American</em> <em>Cinematographer</em></a>, StageCraft isn&#8217;t <em>really</em> rear projection but also isn&#8217;t really like anything else. And yet, amidst all this unprecedented tech, the practical purpose remains the same: by shooting everything in-camera, you reduce the time, money, and workload of post-production.</p>\n<p>That StageCraft is able to make good on that promise in a way traditional rear-projection never cracked is exciting, to say the least. The ability to do real-time, in-camera compositing on-set means <em>The Mandalorian </em>is able to fill the tall order of being a live-action <em>Star Wars </em>television series &#8212; a small-screen project with a big-screen feel. Whether for television or film, the implications are exciting: that both production workflows and visual fidelity could improve in tandem.</p>\n<p><iframe title=\"The Virtual Production of The Mandalorian, Season One\" width=\"700\" height=\"394\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gUnxzVOs3rk?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>Considering that back in the 1970s <strong><i>Star War</i>s</strong>’ use of optical effects was the supposed <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEHl3b8_cFw&#38;ab_channel=HonorTheForce\">nail in the coffin</a> for process photography, it’s somewhat poetic that the same franchise is pulling the technique back into the spotlight.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>What&#8217;s the precedent?</h2>\n<p>In what is becoming a regular staple of this column, the idea for rear projection &#8212; by one <strong>Norman O. Dawn</strong> in 1913 &#8212; came way before the actual technique. Three unrelated technical developments in the 1930s made the technique possible: projectors that could synchronize shutters; better, panchromatic film stock; and more powerful projection lamps.</p>\n<p>The first Hollywood studio to use rear projection was Fox Film Corporation’s <strong><em>Liliom</em></strong> in 1934. Appropriately, the film was subsequently recognized by the Academy for its efforts. The technique was then refined by Paramount Picture’s <strong>Farciot Edouart</strong> ASC, who developed new methods including brightening exposure and synching multiple projectors to the same plate.</p>\n<p>The process became more standardized with a screen that had been specifically developed by <strong>Sidney Sanders</strong> for <em><strong>King Kong</strong> </em>in 1933 that was not only bigger and more flexible but capable of supporting a higher quality image. <em>King Kong</em>&#8216;s composition shots were optical effects, not process photography, but the improved screens they used were an important innovation for future process effects.</p>\n<p>Rear projection is a special effect with a long past and a bright future. So next time you scoff at an Old Hollywood car two-hander: the modern incarnation of this technology is actually now <a href=\"https://nofilmschool.com/ilm-stagecraft-mandalorian\">being heralded as </a>the future of television.

It was an empty void for my exhausted brain, a place to lay my head while barely paying attention for several hours. The drama was juicy, the stories were unbelievable, TLC had me hooked, and I couldn’t fight it.</p>\n<p>But after so many seasons, you begin to realize that what is being called “reality” is simply a dramatized version of real-life that preys on America’s obsession <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/movies-about-immigration-and-refugees-1d908819a972/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">with immigration</a>. It shows those assumed gold diggers who are only coming here for money and a green card. Immigrants in <em>90 Day Fiancé</em> are guilty until proven innocent, instead of being viewed as complex people with complicated stories. However, there has come a response, if you will, to this increased interest in the issue of immigration.</p>\n<p>Isabel Sandoval’s <strong><em>Lingua Franca</em></strong> stars the filmmaker as Olivia<em>,</em> a trans woman from the Phillipines who is trying to get her green card so she can live without fear of deportation. She works, undocumented, as the caretaker for Olga, an aging Russian woman. She feeds her, bathes her, and does everything necessary to keep her safe. The money she earns from assisting Olga goes towards two things: paying a man to marry her and helping her family back home pay the bills. Sandoval portrays Olivia’s experience with care and honesty. This is not an exploitative exposé about applying for a green card. It&#8217;s a look at the true and lived experiences of immigrants who seek green cards for better opportunities and a better life.</p>\n<p>I wanted to draw a comparison between these seemingly opposite pieces of media after watching two marriage scenes in <em>Lingua Franca</em>. The first comes when Olivia goes to get a marriage license with someone who has agreed to be her partner. It is purely transactional: she still needs to pay him 5,000 more dollars and he’ll get married to her so she can get her green card. This honesty about the process and how normalized it is made stand in stark contrast to constant questioning in <em>90 Day Fiancé</em>. Olivia has firmly and clearly established what she needs to get what she wants, which illustrates that this is not done to take advantage of American men. She is not tricking him or lying to him about what she needs. There is no faux relationship. This is purely about an exchange that is mutually beneficial for both parties.</p>\n<p>The second moment comes when Olivia’s childhood friend, Trixie (Ivory Aquino), is successfully married. As she and her husband recite their vows at the courthouse, the camera cuts to Olivia, who is staring blankly into nothingness. She is not celebrating or smiling — instead, she is reflecting on her own future and whether she will get what she truly wants. Marriage to Olivia is all about survival, not about planning an elaborate wedding in a short amount of time. There is no sugar coating the process in the name of ratings and palatable drama.</p>\n<p>The desire for a green card is dangled like a carrot in front of the subjects in <em>90 Day Fiancé</em>. Family members of their spouse sneer about their immigration status, end-of-season specials ask them over and over again if they’re only in it for the green card, and their intentions are constantly seen as predatory. People yell, “Go back to your country,” and hurl other abusive insults regularly, with the cameras never trying to invoke sympathy for the non-American subjects. Instead, they want to create villains and antagonists that bring viewers back for more.</p>\n<p>In <em>Lingua Franca</em>, that villainization is replaced with empathy. Immigration is not constantly scrutinized, joked about, and shamed. Sound bites from the news are played over quiet scenes of Olivia walking home, as she is constantly reminded of what others think of her. But she is never openly abused for her immigration status, as the film wants to show a bigger scope of living in America as a non-citizen. There is more than racist remarks hurled in public — it is a perpetual feeling of loneliness and isolation. Sandoval also speaks about her constant fear of getting arrested and the uncertainty that surrounds how much time she was left in the United States. <em>Lingua Franca</em> shifts the narrative around getting a green card to truly depict a nuanced and complex look at such a disputed issue.</p>\n<p>In fact, Olivia’s experience as an immigrant is placed in direct comparison with the more traditional or acceptable experience of the Russian family she works for. They speak of the patriarch&#8217;s journey to America and how his family worked hard to get where they are. This particularly whitewashed and cis-heteronormative story is the one many are made to believe makes a “good” immigrant. In short, they are allowed to be here because they proved themselves to be a specific kind of good and successful. Meanwhile, Olivia, a trans and Filipino woman, actively rejects this narrative in order to live as an Asian woman in the United States, which leaves her in limbo.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, the ethos of <em>90 Day Fiancé</em> lives between these two ideas of immigration. While many non-American partners are scrutinized about their intentions, they are also shown eventually conforming to that idea of the American Dream. Their experiences are either villainized then tamed or they are accepted for their performance as a citizen. They must fit into one box or another, rather than existing in a liminal space like Olivia.</p>\n<p>If <em>90 Day Fiancé</em> is meant to reflect what Americans truly care about in the immigration process — lies, money, drama — then <em>Lingua Franca</em> is meant to reflect the reality of what it means to gain citizenship and the fear that comes with it. Sandoval does not want to just entertain audiences but also educate them on the lived experience of an immigrant in Trump’s America. It is more than screaming matches and uncomfortable marriages. It is about grasping onto your humanity in a system that wants to strip it away.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/7mk42jDMGNw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 13 Sep 2020 20:16:08 +0000","feedId":24,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"331b6b76f2afef4db4dfa518da826696","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Mary Beth McAndrews","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/7mk42jDMGNw":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn95@2020_2/2020/09/16/05-04-05-012_45b884ceb4c89411.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1600232624722},{"createdTime":"2020-09-16 13:03:44","updatedTime":"2020-09-16 13:03:44","title":"‘Raised By Wolves’ Paints a Grand Tale Across a Small Canvas","link":"https://filmschoolrejects.com/?p=357235","description":"<p>Ridley Scott is no stranger to science fiction tales. <em>Alien</em> (1979) and <em>Blade Runner</em> (1982) are early standouts from the start of his career, and the last decade saw him return to the stars with <em>Prometheus</em> (2012) and <em>Alien: Covenant</em> (2017). The four films vary when it comes to action, tone, and narrative, but a common theme running throughout involves the very nature of what it means to be human. It&#8217;s heady stuff, and Scott tends to explore the concept through violence, questions of faith, and his well-documented mistrust of androids. It&#8217;s 2020, and he&#8217;s back at it again as executive producer and director (of the first three episodes) of HBO Max&#8217;s new sci-fi series, <strong><em>Raised By Wolves</em></strong>.</p>\n<p>[Note: This review covers the first five episodes of <em>Raised By Wolves</em>&#8216; ten-episode season. Don&#8217;t worry if you&#8217;re not caught up yet, though, as it&#8217;s fairly light on spoilers.]</p>\n<p>Surprising exactly no one, humanity has turned the Earth into a graveyard. An epic war between religious believers and atheists has leveled the planet and sent the survivors off-world in search of a new home. Mithraism is Christianity adjacent and sees its faithful kowtowing to the sun god Sol, and their crusade to bring their religion to everyone by force has led to war. One of the most powerful tools in their arsenal are the combat androids, but as the war reaches its final bloody days an atheist engineer reprograms one along with a traditional work model as Mother (Amanda Collin) and Father (Abubakar Salim), respectively &#8212; and launches them towards the unpopulated Kepler-22.</p>\n<p>Packed away in their carry-on luggage? Six human embryos and all the necessary ingredients and tools to restart humanity without the pesky annoyance of religious belief. The last of the Mithraic aren&#8217;t far behind, though, but while most of the people on their spaceship Heaven perish, a handful of survivors crash land on Kepler-22. The war they all thought they left behind has crashed with them, and the fate of humanity has never been more fragile.</p>\n<p><em>Raised By Wolves</em> teases an intergalactic war of ideologies with its setup and a handful of flashbacks, but the focus of creator Aaron Guzikowski&#8217;s series &#8212; or at least of these first five episodes &#8212; is a far more intimate conversation. The atheist androids struggle to raise their human children, but illness, local wildlife, and those pesky fundamentalists keep getting in the way. It also makes little sense raising them atheistic by telling them not to believe in god&#8230; a concept they had no knowledge of beforehand. That aspect leads to trouble with one of the kids, Campion (Winta McGrath), who comes to believe that everything has a soul despite the fierce disagreement by Mother. What starts as a grand religious crusade instead morphs into the violent and frustrating ups and downs of parenting. That&#8217;s not a knock, but the result is a show that&#8217;s much smaller than previously imagined.</p>\n<p>There are a lot of characters at play here between the androids, the human adults, and the children, but the series divides its time mainly between two couples. Mother and Father are meant to be emotionless androids dutifully doing the bidding of their atheist programmer, but while Father cracks corny &#8220;dad jokes&#8221; Mother has occasional outbursts &#8212; remember, she&#8217;s a combat droid &#8212; that splatter biological life forms into so much messy particulate. Her sensibilities grow increasingly at odds with the more sedate Father, too, and it&#8217;s these sequences of carnage and conflict that raise the show&#8217;s heartbeat.</p>\n<p>While that storyline justifies <em>Raised By Wolves</em>&#8216; budget and delivers more eye-candy in the form of Mother taking the form of a flying death-dealer, the far more engaging drama is unfolding on the purely human side. Marcus (Travis Fimmel) and Sue (Niamh Algar) are highly ranked soldiers in the Mithraic forces, but they&#8217;re actually members of the atheist resistance &#8212; they killed the real couple and had facial surgery to take on their appearance and identities. Their new role comes with a son (Felix Jamieson), but after bonding with him they&#8217;re heartbroken when he, along with the rest of the surviving children, are taken by Mother.</p>\n<p>Marcus and Sue&#8217;s journey is both intriguing and affecting while the android couple&#8217;s is a balance of spectacle and the mundane annoyances of children. Fimmel&#8217;s and Algar&#8217;s performances go a long way in making their half of the story more interesting, and it&#8217;s due in large part to their humanity &#8212; in both its pros and cons. Power struggles and rising madness threaten the human survivors, and Marcus may even be experiencing an unexpected increase in faith. Sue, meanwhile, sees her husband transforming but remains laser focused on recovering their son, and the dynamic between her and Mother raises some of the series&#8217; more interesting conflicts.</p>\n<p>Neither is the biological parent of these children and they&#8217;ve yet to come face to face, but both are prepared to kill to protect the children against threats real and perceived. They&#8217;re at odds, but neither is the show&#8217;s villain, at least not yet, and that leaves something of an odd void in the show&#8217;s narrative. The conflict that kicks off the whole series, fundamentalist versus atheist, is pushed to the edges of the frame. The &#8220;bad&#8221; guys, the other Mithraic survivors, lack individuality meaning they&#8217;re mostly unmemorable, and the minimal nature of their contact with the androids so far leaves that big ideological conflict wanting.</p>\n<p><em>Raised By Wolves</em> sees all of this unfold on a planet with giant holes in its surface and even bigger snake-like skeletons &#8212; here&#8217;s hoping we see some giant sand worms before <em>Dune</em> hits theaters &#8212; so the understood implication is that there are more reveals to come. The surviving fundamentalists feel far from a true threat, through, and it will lack bite if it resurfaces in the form of a new convert. This leaves the show&#8217;s back half, the remaining five episodes, to play out a conflict built less on ideology and more on the belief that only &#8220;we&#8221; can raise these children the right way. As with all of human history that came before it, the issue is less about a difference of opinion as to which god if any is looking down upon us&#8230; and more about which side can enforce that opinion the most viciously and effectively.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/v5pzbYAl1w0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 16 Sep 2020 01:16:14 +0000","feedId":24,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"30d14f2d3131dd1c89ff802ab42e5234","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Rob Hunter","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/v5pzbYAl1w0":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn72@2020_3/2020/09/16/05-04-05-359_336f19118fe3a075.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1600232624721},{"createdTime":"2020-09-16 13:03:44","updatedTime":"2020-09-16 13:03:44","title":"The Harsh Reality Behind ‘Wind River’","link":"https://filmschoolrejects.com/?p=357094","description":"<p><em><a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/topics/through-a-native-lens/\">Through a Native Lens</a> is a new column from film critic and citizen of the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma Shea Vassar, who will dive into the nuance of Hollywood’s best and worst cases of Indigenous representation.

Frantically, a young girl runs across the cold white blanket. She stumbles around, becoming unable to make it much further. A few days later, US Fish and Wildlife tracker Cory Lambert (Jeremy Renner) finds her body. He identifies her as Natalie, a young Native woman who is just eighteen years old. Sheridan’s attempt to talk about continued colonial violence is a well-intentioned gesture. However, the truth that inspired the film is an everyday reality for Native women, and i</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">n order to understand <em>Wind River</em>, the history and understanding of the modern threat to Native women must be understood. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Colonial violence has been an issue since the beginning of exploration. <a href=\"https://archive.org/stream/christophercolu02thacgoog#page/n451/mode/2up/search/women\">Christopher Columbus’ own writing states</a> that he and his men would enslave women and children for labor and sexual acts. The story of Matoaka, <a href=\"https://indiancountrytoday.com/archive/the-true-story-of-pocahontas-historical-myths-versus-sad-reality-WRzmVMu47E6Guz0LudQ3QQ\">known to most as Pocahontas</a>, includes her being kidnapped and raped before being taken away from her homelands. Countless unnamed women and femme-presenting individuals have experienced horrible attacks since European contact and historical oppression. This violence continues in many forms to this day, in many places, including reservations like Wind River. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Originally, no one was recording the Missing and Murdered crisis. Indigenous organizations have assembled teams and released reports and other tools to help document the violence. For example, the Sovereign Bodies Institute <a href=\"https://www.sovereign-bodies.org/mmiw-database\">created a database</a> that holds the testimonies regarding any Indigenous woman, girl, or two-spirit community member who has experienced domestic violence, sexual assault, police brutality, gender violence, or another form of attack. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is a necessary step in getting the people in power to care about this violence as well as finding ways to be preventative. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are some details of <em>Wind River</em> that are extremely accurate. One in three Native American women will be sexually assaulted in her lifetime, and murder is the third leading cause of death among American Indian/Alaska Native women. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Natalie is attacked, brutalized, and sexually assaulted by other men who live in the man camp while visiting her boyfriend Matt, who works as security on an oil rig. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Man camp is another term for the temporary housing for the workers and is a big threat in areas where big oil and pipeline construction are evident. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The overwhelmingly male labor forces that are brought in to work at these sites are a complete menace to reservations and other tribal communities. The toxic masculinity that comes with these makeshift living situations puts locals at risk, especially Native women and femme-presenting individuals from Indigenous communities.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://nij.ojp.gov/media/image/19456\">According to the National Institute of Justice</a>, a majority of the perpetrators against Native citizens are non-Native. The current battles led by community matriarchs in Minnesota and surrounding areas <a href=\"https://www.stopline3.org/\">against Line 3</a>, Wet’suwet’en territory <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2020/02/23/wetsuweten-protest-coastal-gaslink-pipeline/\">against the Coastal GasLink pipeline</a>, and in unceded Secwepemc Territory with the Tiny House Warriors <a href=\"http://www.tinyhousewarriors.com/\">against the Trans Mountain pipeline</a> are evidence of these threats. The quest for oil not only is a non-consensual violation of the Earth but also of Indigenous bodies.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As in <em>Wind River</em>, usually, the more serious crimes like murder, fall under federal jurisdiction. This is why FBI Agent Jane Banner (Elizabeth Olsen) receives Natalie’s case. Her lack of preparation is obvious from the moment she steps out of her vehicle in a thin jacket instead of full winter gear. She is like a good amount of North America: unaware of the systematic powers at work which led to the untimely death of a young Native woman. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though statutes have tried to empower tribal communities and current bills are stuck in Congress, the reasoning for this goes back to when the United States was first established. The federal government held the power over tribal affairs under the Articles of Confederation. When the Constitution was being written in order to replace the Articles of Confederation and limit federal power, the throwing in of “and with the Indian tribes” at the end of Article 1, Section 8, Clause 3 created the federal basis for all tribal law. Obviously, the United States was much smaller and did not involve all 576 federally recognized tribes that are victims of colonial violence today. </span></p>\n<p>The biggest flaw in <em>Wind River</em> is that Natalie is not the main character in the story about Native death. The discovery of her body is the impetus for the film, the reason why Cory and Jane are searching for answers. The film renders her a prop, a vessel for the emotion of the white male protagonist found in Cory and his white female sidekick, Agent Banner.</p>\n<p>While the entirety of the film is heavy, a bleakness is shadowing over the main character, Cory. This is because of another Native girl&#8217;s death: Cory&#8217;s daughter and Natalie&#8217;s best friend, Emily. &#8220;We tried to be very careful with Emily,&#8221; Cory states when telling Jane about her death. &#8220;Tried to plan for everything. She was such a good girl. But we let our guard down.&#8221; This main character&#8217;s guilt as well as the identity of her killer oversees every moment in <em>Wind River</em>, tainting the story by putting a white male gaze on an all too true experience.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like the unknown situations that led to Emily&#8217;s death, most Native families do not get answers about their loved ones who go missing or are murdered. There are still too many names of relatives from all different communities that have yet to find a sliver of justice and a</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> good amount of the current solutions presented to Native communities are like putting a bandaid on a gunshot. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Legislation can only help so much since the federal government doesn&#8217;t have the best record with tribes. In order to completely destroy this treacherous force that is attempting to eliminate Indigenous people, we must be proactive. This means standing in solidarity with those who are on the frontlines, protesting pipeline construction. We must advocate for the inclusion of Native histories and current events in educational curriculums. Ultimately, we must continue fighting against stereotypical Native imagery that serves as mascots and underdeveloped plotlines in the media. </span></p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/X415X3DkpqU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 15 Sep 2020 16:16:52 +0000","feedId":24,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"a30dac1c145efb77ac0b59f002003c95","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Shea Vassar","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/X415X3DkpqU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn39@2020_1/2020/09/16/05-04-05-040_70044aaace88a27b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1600232624714},{"createdTime":"2020-09-16 13:03:44","updatedTime":"2020-09-16 13:03:44","title":"‘Tarantulas: The Deadly Cargo’ Sends Foreign Spiders Into the Heartland","link":"https://filmschoolrejects.com/?p=357219","description":"<p><em>Welcome to <strong><a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/topics/43-forgotten/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">4:3 &#38; Forgotten</a></strong> — a weekly column in which <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/author/fisher/\">Kieran Fisher</a> and I get to look back at TV terrors that scared adults (and the kids they let watch) across the limited airwaves of the ’70s.

They&#8217;re not called banana spiders for nothing! Soon locals are dropping dead &#8212; including a kid who just wanted to touch his first spider! &#8212; and while the mayor yells about &#8220;oranges!&#8221; a small band of heroes gather to defeat the fangy horde with hi-tech audio equipment. Yeah, you read that right.</p>\n<p><em>Tarantulas: The Deadly Cargo</em> isn&#8217;t great cinema, but as a made-for-TV <em>Jaws</em> ripoff it&#8217;s an entertaining romp. It checks the boxes on all of the subgenre&#8217;s necessary elements, and while the budget, director Stuart Hagmann, and the restraints of television keep things fairly unmemorable on the set-piece side it manages more than a little fun. (Co-writer Guerdon Trueblood has been down this bug-filled road before with <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/70s-tv-horror-ants-1977/\"><em>Ants!</em> (1977)</a> which premiered on a different network just four weeks prior.) The townspeople are a mix of stoic heroics (storoics, if you will) and crazy drama, the cast is a solid mix of familiar faces, and the mayor is the best since ol&#8217; Murray &#8220;Vaughn&#8221; Hamilton sleazed his way through the streets of Amity.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-357234\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/tarantulas-tv-guide.jpg\" alt=\"Tarantulas Tv Guide\" width=\"400\" height=\"275\" />Mayor Douglas (Burt Remsen; <em>Eye of the Tiger</em>, 1986) is a real piece of work. In addition to running the town he also heads up the town&#8217;s biggest employer, the orange farm, and he&#8217;s not here for any talk about destroying oranges to kill the spiders. He&#8217;s told about the plane crash&#8230; &#8220;We gotta get these people back to picking oranges.&#8221; He&#8217;s shown the carnage and the dead bodies&#8230; &#8220;We gotta get these people back to picking oranges.&#8221; He&#8217;s informed the spiders have taken up residence in his orange warehouse&#8230; well, you get the idea. He goes so far as to threaten to arrest the fire chief (Claude Akins; <em>Tentacles</em>, 1977) and town doctor (Pat Hingle, <em>Maximum Overdrive</em>, 1986) if they let people know about the killer arachnids. He&#8217;s the worst.</p>\n<p>The townspeople are hardly better, though, as evidenced by their behavior throughout this disaster. One guy steals coffee from the plane while the bodies are carted away, and he&#8217;s bit. A woman having an affair thinks it&#8217;s her lover tickling her foot only to discover it&#8217;s a spider, and she&#8217;s bit. The guy whose side piece just died suggests burning down the warehouse so he can collect the insurance money, and while he&#8217;s not bit he does fall to his death. Another dude isn&#8217;t interested in a serious relationship with his girlfriend because she has a kid brother she cares for, but once the boy dies it&#8217;s smooth sailing for their relationship! (He&#8217;s the hero.)</p>\n<p><em>Tarantulas: The Deadly Cargo</em> may not ever be truly thrilling, and sure, it ends on something of a low-key note as they gaslight the spiders into thinking they&#8217;re surrounded by spider-wasps, but a kid gets bit and bites it! It&#8217;s a passably fun ninety-minutes for fans of such things even if does pull a <em>Scream</em> (1996) by opening with Tom Atkins, getting viewers excited, and then killing him off in the opening minutes.</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/topics/43-forgotten/\">Turn the dial (okay fine just click here) for more 4:3 &#38; Forgotten</a>.</em></p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/-dOa-9-5FWk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 14 Sep 2020 04:58:25 +0000","feedId":24,"bgimg":"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/tarantulas-tv-guide.jpg","linkMd5":"685988bb881ef14555c2c870763b6065","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn3@2020_3/2020/09/16/05-04-02-477_f60cc3421ae70b13.webp","destWidth":400,"destHeight":275,"sourceBytes":36268,"destBytes":22354,"author":"Rob Hunter","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/tarantulas-tv-guide.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn3@2020_3/2020/09/16/05-04-02-477_f60cc3421ae70b13.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/-dOa-9-5FWk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn64@2020_6/2020/09/16/05-04-19-118_fab94dd027f6bc74.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1600232624722},{"createdTime":"2020-09-16 13:03:44","updatedTime":"2020-09-16 13:03:44","title":"‘Nomadland’ is an Escape from the American Dream","link":"https://filmschoolrejects.com/?p=357218","description":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The failing healthcare system, cost of education, and frequent instances of unemployment are just a few of the ugly threats to the American dream. While many envision a house on the corner with a white picket fence, others see the vanity and emptiness that come from the acquisitions of material goods. <strong>Chloe Zhao</strong>&#8216;s <strong><em>Nomadland</em></strong> is a portrait of a subculture who have chosen to escape from the unrealistic expectations of the capitalistic delusion. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the film, Fern (<strong>Frances McDormand</strong>) leaves the place she’s known for most of her adult life. The emotion surrounding her husband&#8217;s death along with the inability to get a steady job motivates her to find something new. This change leads Fern to practice a nomadic lifestyle as she travels around, sustaining herself with cash from temporary work while also seeking true human connection. Fern is not homeless but houseless, making constant improvements and renovations to the van she lives in that takes her from place to place. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At each stop where she camps, Fern meets others who have refused to live the standard force-fed lifestyle of working until they die. During these times, a small community emerges as the group exchanges tools, shares emotional baggage through storytelling, and supports each other in true acts of mutual aid. They take care of their fellow nomads with a rare level of respect that leaves no room for judgment. A candid moment of a trade involving a can opener and a potholder is a reminder that there are alternatives to shopping at a big-box retailer. In the same way, there are other options than just social media for human connection. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In <em>Nomadland</em> each person has a specific reason for rejecting the normal habits that society celebrates. Swankie, an older woman Fern becomes friends with, eventually tells of her eight-month cancer prognosis. Instead of living the last of her days in a hospital room, connected to wires and tubes as she listens to the constant beeping and nurse&#8217;s chatter, she decides to travel to a place that once made her feel alive. She describes a profound experience, a moment during kayaking where hundreds of swallows and their newborn offspring swarmed around her. Swankie wants to spend her final moments feeling that joy, something usually removed from the so-called American dream.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zhao’s choice to use mostly non-actors, something she has also done in previous projects, enhances the sincerity of <em>Nomadland</em>. A pink and blue sunset in the desert, a cigarette being lit, a conversation with an acquaintance about loss: every moment shown on screen not only adds to Fern’s search for self-discovery but to the appeal of living a lifestyle fueled by something other than what capitalism calls success. This doesn&#8217;t mean <em>Nomadland</em> is a romanticized version of fact, perfected for an Instagram post or to sell a version of the truth that doesn&#8217;t exist. Instead, the film is a reminder that we have the choice to live as we please. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is an attempt to find value in one’s self outside of capitalism even if most of society doesn&#8217;t agree. This is evident every time someone knocks on the van window to tell Fern to park elsewhere or of the location of the nearest homeless shelter. What they don&#8217;t understand is she is content living and traveling out of her van. This is most palpable when it suddenly doesn’t start. She takes the vehicle into the auto shop where the mechanic informs her of the $2,000 cost to fix her van. Another mechanic chimes in to give unwanted advice, stating that because of the high mileage, it would make more sense to sell it and invest in a new one. “I spent a lot of time and money building the inside out and a lot of people don&#8217;t see the value in that,” she answers the mechanic, which is true. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Fern understands the unaccounted worth of the life around her, the type of importance that can’t be computed into dollar signs, a majority of the world around her has not explored what the meaning of value is outside of money. Still, we all fall into the traps that capitalism has set around. During a moment at an RV show with her friend, Linda May, and another lady, they all laugh as they step into the newest and most adorned vehicle on display. They sit inside and dream about driving to Hawaii, despite the water that stands between the open road and their goal destination. In the end, these ladies would not trade the inner happiness they&#8217;ve found being nomads for any monetary amount or decked out RV. They have found true companionship along the road. </span></p>\n<p>Of course, the most important companion for a nomad is one&#8217;s self. This is evident in Fern&#8217;s transformation from the beginning to the end. The person who was once weighed down by the loss of her life partner and the failure to find work is now content being on her own. The current marketplace cannot survive on consumers finding happiness and self-worth. How could anything sell if we as a society no longer need superfluous items and substances to cope with our inner battles? This doesn&#8217;t mean we do not feel sadness or anger, but in an environment less ruled by capitalism, there is no place to see these sorts of emotions as negative.</p>\n<p>The failure of America&#8217;s capitalism is even more evident now during a global pandemic. While this is not an ideal time to break our current leases and set out across the country in a van, it is an opportunity to be like Fern and reevaluate our own relationship with value and self-worth. It can be as easy as trading a can opener for a potholder, sharing a laugh with an acquaintance, or taking a walk alone to learn everything that makes us human.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/u5LmmmOi62Y\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 15 Sep 2020 11:16:57 +0000","feedId":24,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"33f56f1ff9243c2942e7cb631f0ce0e0","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Shea Vassar","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/u5LmmmOi62Y":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn99@2020_3/2020/09/16/05-04-05-045_5ef9668110f9efaa.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1600232624721},{"createdTime":"2020-09-16 13:03:44","updatedTime":"2020-09-16 13:03:44","title":"How Wes Anderson’s Nod to Hitchcock Exemplifies What an Homage Should Be","link":"https://filmschoolrejects.com/?p=357120","description":"<p><em>Welcome to <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/topics/the-queue/\"><strong>The Queue</strong></a> — your daily distraction of curated video content sourced from across the web.

Does it inflect the source material in some new, exciting, or unexpected way? Has it been shifted and made new in a different context?</p>\n<p>The video essay below offers a case study in what makes a blatant recreation an inspired homage rather than a rip-off or an instance of theft. The case at hand is a sequence from <strong>Wes Anderson</strong>&#8216;s <strong><em>The Grand Budapest Hotel</em></strong>, wherein Deputy Kovacs (Jeff Goldblum), the attorney representing the estate of the late Madame D (Tilda Swinton), is stalked and murdered by J.G. Jopling (Willem Dafoe).</p>\n<p>The video outlines in detail how the scene emulates and basically re-creates a sequence from 1966 <strong>Alfred Hitchcock</strong> film <strong><em>Torn Curtain </em></strong>in which Michael Armstrong (Paul Newman) is similarly pursued. However, by imposing his own personal visual style, re-timing the pursuit, and inserting a score, Anderson succeeds in weaving something distinct that still bears recognizable connective threads to its source material. As a result, Anderson is able to play with audience expectations with exciting (if grisly) results.</p>\n<p>Watch &#8220;<strong>How To Steal Like Wes Anderson &#8211; <em>The Grand Budapest Hotel</em></strong>&#8220;:</p>\n<p><iframe title=\"How To Steal Like Wes Anderson - The Grand Budapest Hotel\" width=\"700\" height=\"394\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3GK_3KgZios?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Who made this?</h2>\n<p>This video essay was created by Virginia-based filmmaker and video editor <strong>Thomas Flight</strong>, who runs a YouTube channel under the same name.

In this edition, <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/author/rob/\">Rob Hunter</a> settles in for black &#38; white weirdness with Robert Eggers&#8217; commentary for The Lighthouse!</i></p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>The Witch</em> (2015) was something of a stunner crafted with the kind of exquisite care typically absent from genre fare. The question as to what director Robert Eggers would do next was answered with another period piece, but while the former film aims for terror the latter aims for a more tonally fluid sense of weirdness. The precision is still on display, though, with its story of two men crumbling mentally on a remote rock island. Keep reading to see what I heard on the Eggers&#8217; commentary track for <strong><em>The Lighthouse</em></strong>!</p>\n<h2 class=\"graf graf--h3\">The Lighthouse (2019)</h2>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Commentator: Robert Eggers (director, co-writer, producer)</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong>1.</strong> The opening title treatment is from the treatise of a 19th century book called <em>The Lighthouse</em> &#8220;that has nothing to do with the plot or story of this movie.&#8221; He found it to be an attractive typeface that &#8220;suited the atmosphere of this movie.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>2.</strong> The opening shot was filmed with a Petzval lens which was designed around 1840. &#8220;There&#8217;s obviously a lot of weird lens characteristics which helps transport us back into time and make for a mysterious shot. hopefully.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>3.</strong> It was filmed in part on the southern tip of Nova Scotia in a small fishing village called Cape Forchu.</p>\n<p><strong>4.</strong> They built all of the buildings including the 70-foot working lighthouse tower.</p>\n<p><strong>5.</strong> &#8220;The sound design is very delicate here,&#8221; he says, roughly fifty seconds before the first fart is heard.</p>\n<p><strong>6.</strong> Around the 4:22 mark we see Thomas Howard (Robert Pattinson) trying to get into Thomas Wake&#8217;s (Willem Dafoe) desk. &#8220;Don&#8217;t know if it reads, but that&#8217;s the intention there.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>7.</strong> &#8220;After making <em>The Witch</em> so miserable and self-serious I thought if I was gonna explore misery again I would wanna be able to laugh at it. So. The fart jokes.&#8221; In case you were wondering.</p>\n<p><strong>8.</strong> Part of the sound design behind the water pump noise is a donkey&#8217;s &#8220;hee-haw.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>9.</strong> Dafoe didn&#8217;t want to wear a hat for the first dinner scene, but Eggers wanted his character to look authoritative and in charge. It&#8217;s historically inaccurate as it was considered bad luck to wear hats in the kitchen.</p>\n<p><strong>10.</strong> USLHE is marked and tagged over most of the things at the lighthouse to discourage theft, and it stands for United States Lighthouse Establishment.</p>\n<p><strong>11.</strong> They looked at different ways in which people used tools to help them carry heavy loads, and Pattinson chose the head strap visible at 14:48 because he thought they were cool.</p>\n<p><strong>12.</strong> There were at least eight Robs on-set which caused only minor confusion.</p>\n<p><strong>13.</strong> The main seagull was played by three seagulls from the UK named Lady, Tramp, and Johnny. They&#8217;re rescue birds.</p>\n<p><strong>14.</strong> That&#8217;s a bird puppet swooping up at Pattinson at 17:20, and &#8220;now that I say that it will always look like a puppet for everyone, so maybe I shouldn&#8217;t have said anything.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>15.</strong> The top interior of the lighthouse &#8220;is one of the places where my insistence on historical accuracy maybe wasn&#8217;t the best thing for the movie.&#8221; It&#8217;s too cramped, and he&#8217;s still not sure if he likes any of the scenes filmed up there.</p>\n<p><strong>16.</strong> The screenplay refers to Wake and Howard and Old and Young, respectively, as their names aren&#8217;t even mentioned until halfway through the film.</p>\n<p><strong>17.</strong> Dafoe is afraid of heights and was no fan of going atop the lighthouse, but he&#8217;s a professional and did so without squawking once action was called.</p>\n<p><strong>18.</strong> &#8220;Learning how to roll cigarettes was a problem&#8221; for Pattinson, but he eventually figured it out.</p>\n<p><strong>19.</strong> They shot in 1.19:1 which is &#8220;a rare aspect ration from early sound cinema&#8221; because they felt it captured the cramped quarters and vertical objects well.</p>\n<p><strong>20.</strong> Dafoe learned to knit for the film, but they only found a single scene in which to have him doing it.</p>\n<p><strong>21.</strong> That&#8217;s Hershey&#8217;s chocolate syrup coming out of the water pump at 39:35.</p>\n<p><strong>22.</strong> The seagull murder scene has more impact when watched in color.</p>\n<p><strong>23.</strong> He was somewhat surprised by the success of and reaction to <em>The Witch</em>. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t think it was a bad movie, I thought it was good enough to get some kind of distribution, and I hoped that it would get enough good reviews that maybe someone would let me make another movie.&#8221; Dafoe&#8217;s management team emailed on his behalf saying the actor wanted to meet with him. &#8220;I wanna do whatever you&#8217;re doing next,&#8221; said Dafoe, and they made it happen.</p>\n<p><strong>24.</strong> Eggers had offered Pattinson a role in something more traditional that he was working on, but the actor passed as &#8220;he was only interested in doing challenging and strange stuff.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>25.</strong> The production company (ie the suits) wondered if a more traditional score would be better for <em>The Lighthouse</em>, so Eggers tried it for several scenes before realizing that it just didn&#8217;t work. They eventually decided to have composer Mark Korven add a smidgen of Bernard Herrmann into this score.</p>\n<p><strong>26.</strong> Why yes, the mermaid&#8217;s labia is based on shark genitals.</p>\n<p><strong>27.</strong> Pattinson would stick his fingers down his throat and &#8220;gag himself a little bit&#8221; whenever he was drunk. Eggers shares this only because Pattinson himself had been mentioning it in interviews.</p>\n<p><strong>28.</strong> &#8220;This is the shot where Robert Pattinson said he wanted to punch me in the face,&#8221; he says at the scene with Pattinson running in close-up in the rain at 1:17:59.</p>\n<p><strong>29.</strong> The book that Howard is intently flipping through at 1:26:20 is filled with photos and memorabilia of Wake&#8217;s family.

Every edition brings a working actor’s resumé into focus as we learn about what makes them so compelling. In this entry, we spotlight the film and TV work of Zoë Kravitz.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>The inimitable <strong>Zoë Kravitz</strong> has long been touted as a rising star. Considering her various contributions to the world of fashion, music, and movies for the better part of the past decade, no one should question it. Kravitz’s roots in entertainment run deep, too, thanks to her musician father, Lenny Kravitz, and her actress mother, Lisa Bonet.</p>\n<p>Besides unequivocally hitting the genetic lottery jackpot as one of the most striking, beautiful faces to grace the big and small screen in recent years, young Kravitz embodies everything unequivocally fashionable and cool. It is no wonder then that she repeatedly makes notable appearances in blockbusters and indie film projects alike. Still, despite her undeniable charm and magnetism, she has actually been sidelined for years.</p>\n<p>Kravitz was a minor addition to both comedy and drama ventures from 2007 to 2010. <strong><em>No Reservations</em></strong> is the first of these offerings, in which Kravitz adopts stereotypical goth aesthetics and deadpan line delivery playing a babysitter hired by Catherine Zeta-Jones. That same year, she also appeared in a tonally disparate vehicle as a struggling sex worker in the Jodie Foster crime film, <strong><em>The Brave One</em></strong>.</p>\n<p>The next five movies in Kravitz’s resumé see her curiously on the fringes of their respective narratives. But at the very least, Brett Simon’s comedy <strong><em>Assassination of a High School President</em></strong>, Craig Lucas’ dysfunctional family drama <strong><em>Birds of America</em></strong>, Shana Feste’s heart-wrenching <strong><em>The Greatest</em></strong>, Joel Schumacher’s acrid drug-addled teen flick <strong><em>Twelve</em></strong>, and Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck’s chaotic comedy-drama <strong><em>It&#8217;s Kind of a Funny Story</em></strong> cover a decent breadth of genres.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>It’s Kind of a Funny Story (2010)</h2>\n<p>Boden and Fleck’s film is one of the more interesting offerings in Kravitz’s early career. This weird little movie takes a stab at unpacking the complexities of depression and suicide. Keir Gilchrist’s neurotic protagonist Craig has an unrequited crush on Kravitz&#8217;s character Nia, who just so happens to be his best friend&#8217;s pretty, laidback girlfriend.</p>\n<p>Not only is Nia adorable, but she is also kind, chill, and in tune with Craig’s mental health struggles! Is she all that perfect? Kravitz employs a sweet and empathetic demeanor that certainly easily implores us to believe in her gracious authenticity in the film. However, when she lends that same heartfelt quality to Nia’s less-desirable traits – namely the shallowness and selfishness she would later put on full display – the audience is in for a shocking treat.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Beware the Gonzo (2010)</h2>\n<p>Kravitz&#8217;s initial roles may be small, but she already shows an affinity for dualities. The Bryan Goluboff high school rom-com <strong><em>Beware the Gonzo</em></strong> next exemplifies this by presenting her with the role of a mysterious, alluring outcast named Evie, a girl condemned by a male-dominated student hierarchy that is determined to diminish her with derogatory sexist labels.</p>\n<p>Overall, <em>Beware the Gonzo</em> is all about defending the underdog, tearing down the pillars of stereotype one at a time. As far as Evie is concerned, her plotline involves the reclamation of her very being from the scathing rumors and lies spread by her peers. An archetype like her commonly appears in teen movies, but witnessing Kravitz transform Evie into someone so sincere is a delight. The actress lends immense playfulness and spirit to the part while never shying away from the darkness of her weighted conflicts. Her infectious talent works on another level as well: as a much-needed salve against the irritating flaws in the rest of <em>Beware the Gonzo</em>’s storytelling.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Yelling to the Sky (2011)</h2>\n<p>Kravitz scored her first leading role in Victoria Mahoney’s debut feature, <strong><em>Yelling to the Sky</em></strong>. Her knack for portraying imperturbable facades of nonchalance is duly tested when she dons the part of the film’s protagonist, Sweetness, a studious and quiet high-schooler who suffers from severe disruptions in both her home and school life.</p>\n<p>Caught in the fray of emotionally unavailable family members and school bullies, Sweetness is a ticking time bomb. She is a perpetual people pleaser out of necessity with no time to process the emotional fallout of her circumstances. In the first twenty-five minutes of <em>Yelling to the Sky</em> alone, Sweetness is left to fend for herself, with no time or space to openly explore her own wants and interests. Thus, when the character ultimately gets in too deep with local criminals and unsavory influences, an avalanche of trauma is inevitable.</p>\n<p>Kravitz has no trouble depicting Sweetness in her many shades. She can be your regular teenager – geeky, endearing, and slightly annoying with her jokes and naivete. Kravitz counteracts this by continuously hinting at Sweetness’ inner distress through glassy-eyed stares and a metamorphosizing posture. At first, she is minute and shy, but before long, her false confidences swallow her whole. Kravitz’s considered nuance quickly reminds audiences that Sweetness is just a kid whose youth has been stripped from them far too soon. Even as she makes a myriad of mistakes – some more forgivable than others – we ultimately understand her at her core.</p>\n<p><iframe title=\"Yelling to the Sky Official Trailer #1 (2012) - Gabourey Sidibe, Zoe Kravitz Movie HD\" width=\"700\" height=\"394\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y5CSo_E3vpQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<hr />\n<h2>X-Men: First Class (2011)</h2>\n<p>Kravitz’s resumé received a substantial boost once she got inducted into the <em>X-Men</em> universe in Matthew Vaughn’s <strong><em>X-Men: First Class</em></strong>. Serving as a prequel to the popular film trilogy released between 2000 and 2006, the movie follows the very beginnings of the celebrated hero-villain dynamic between Professor X (James McAvoy) and Magneto (Michael Fassbender), who recruit several new mutants in an attempt to stop the villainous Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon).</p>\n<p>Kravitz takes on the role of Angel Salvatore, a winged young woman who is drafted from her stripping gig for this brand-new mutant task force. She tirelessly trains with her fellow superpowered teammates, allowing Kravitz to use significant physicality throughout <em>First Class</em>. Unfortunately, Angel isn’t really a primary focus in the film. She doesn’t even get to show off all her powers to their full effect, which – alongside flight – include acidic spit bombs. Hence, although the film was Kravitz’s most mainstream release at that point, it criminally underuses her.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Treading Water (2013)</h2>\n<p>Similar – if not harsher – criticisms can be aimed at M. Night Shyamalan’s <strong><em>After Earth</em></strong>. I get that the film is primarily an adventure vehicle for Will and Jaden Smith, but casting Kravitz as a dead sister who only pops up in short flashback sequences is practically unforgivable.</p>\n<p>Instead, the indie comedy-drama <strong><em>Treading Water</em></strong> – originally titled <strong><em>The Boy Who Smells Like Fish</em></strong> – is her superior film of 2013. Opposite Douglas Smith&#8217;s awkward protagonist, Mica – who is exiled by the masses for his strong body odor – Kravitz’s Laura packs a hefty punch. Regrettably, she plays a love interest once again. Nevertheless, armed with a cheery disposition and biting wit, Kravitz makes Laura truly relatable despite any revelation of the character’s quirks.</p>\n<p>Indeed, Laura comes across as almost <em>too</em> effervescent at times. However, her perpetually bubbly exterior is merely a cover-up of many deep-seated anxieties surrounding self-perception. That said, the girl is thoroughly compelling, effortlessly charming her way into Mica&#8217;s and the audience’s hearts alike.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Pretend We’re Kissing (2014)</h2>\n<p><em>Treading Water</em> acts as a reasonable predecessor to both <strong><em>Pretend We&#8217;re Kissing</em></strong> and <strong><em>The Road Within</em></strong>. Both of these films seem to divvy up the lighthearted and somber themes of the former and especially single out the actress’ capabilities in either genre.</p>\n<p>Because Kravitz is absolutely hilarious as the zany, free-spirited Autumn in <em>Pretend We’re Kissing</em>. Frankly, she is the third wheel in this little <em>Before Sunrise</em>-adjacent indie about whirlwind love. Nonetheless, Kravitz turns in a positively jaunty performance with gusto. The airiness of her larger-than-life spiritualistic character is grounded in virtuousness, making Autumn at least somewhat self-aware and far less over-the-top than she would have been otherwise. Kravitz is so naturally likable regardless of this New Age guru&#8217;s ridiculous musings that she outshines the film’s leads by miles.</p>\n<p><iframe title=\"Pretend We&#039;re Kissing - Bonus Clip
