Sure, my reaction (which came just moments after the design was released) may have been premature, and so were the memes that followed the debut of the &#8216;cheesegrater Mac&#8217;&#8230; but even now, 2 years down the line, it feels slightly cathartic to know that my opinion hasn&#8217;t really changed &#8211; the 2019 Mac Pro still looks visibly odd and sort of gets my skin crawling.</p>\n<p>Recently though, the media discovered a patent for an iPhone that used the &#8216;cheesegrater&#8217; texture for efficient cooling or thermal transmission, and let&#8217;s just say, people weren&#8217;t happy. Some even legitimately debunked it as an April Fool&#8217;s Prank from Apple. My thoughts on the matter weren&#8217;t any different &#8211; it sounds like a terrible idea, but I thought the best thing to do would be to really give Apple the benefit of the doubt and MAKE a cheesegrater iPhone just so I have something to visually judge it by.</p>\n<p>Presenting, the &#8216;Cheesegrater&#8217; Case for the iPhone 12 Pro. Made from a TPE bumper and a machined aluminum backplate, the case puts the familiar cheesegrater texture on the back of the iPhone to help it cool more efficiently (well at least in theory). In theory, it&#8217;s also perfectly suited to mince cloves of garlic or grate some Parmigiano Reggiano.</p>\n<p>Now that we have a (sort of) clear vision of what the cheesegrater texture would look like on an iPhone, let&#8217;s objectively and subjectively judge this. For starters, it just looks like a really bad idea. Objectively speaking, a textured metal body would most certainly trap dirt, dust, pieces of lint, aside from also preventing the phone from wirelessly charging. The current textured metal plate is 1mm thick, and for any sort of texture, you&#8217;d need 3D depth which adds unnecessary thickness to the phone &#8211; something Apple probably won&#8217;t want to do. Subjectively speaking, the texture looks worse on the iPhone than on the Mac Pro (although it may also be my execution). Apple&#8217;s patent file states “the components of the electronic device may be designed to provide a unique and pleasing look and feel for a user”, a purpose that gets defeated when even Digital Trends calls it <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/apple-patent-cheese-grater-design-iphone/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">&#8220;Apple&#8217;s worst-ever design idea&#8221;</a>. Moreover, at that scale, the texture could actually be used as a garlic press or a microplane for grating hard cheeses, which makes it difficult to take seriously when the texture is on a $1200 flagship smartphone. Let&#8217;s not even get into the &#8216;trypophobia&#8217; angle.</p>\n<p>My opinions aside, it seems like a weird idea for Apple to take such an extreme route for “enhanced levels of heat removal”. What exactly is the iPhone doing that it would even need desktop-grade heat removal? Is Apple going all-in on AR, or is it looking to put more powerful Apple-built silicone chips in their new iPhones? We&#8217;ll never really know. All we can say with a certain degree of confidence is that a &#8216;Cheesegrater&#8217; iPhone isn&#8217;t really a great idea&#8230;</p>\n<p>If you really want to make your own

opera house, and design institute. Since then, it’s been revealed that Dominique Perrault Architecture (DPA), in collaboration with Chinese design studio Zhubo Design Co., has won the international competition for the new campus of Shenzhen’s Institute of Design and Innovation.</p>\n<p>The new campus will form one of Southern University of Science and Technology’s future schools, located along the rural hillside of Shenzhen. Committed to preserving the natural landscape of Shenzhen’s rural region, the winning design embraces a large-scale horizontal campus that stretches for more than 700 meters. Comprised of two main areas that run parallel to one another, “Hyper-Ground” and “Hyper-Roof,” DPA planned the campus with sociability and sustainability in mind.</p>\n<p>The design’s “Hyper-Ground” component contains the chunk of the university’s services and meeting areas, including the library, auditorium, and exhibition halls. The design’s ground level consists of open-air social hubs woven throughout university infrastructure to promote hybridization of disciplines and design innovation. Chiseled throughout campus’ ground-level facilities in a pedestrian promenade where students and the public alike can enjoy various commercial services and access points to the university’s educational faculties.</p>\n<p>Filling out the winning design’s “Hyper-Roof,” students and the general public can escape from the social scene down below to garden spaces and outdoor sports areas. The “Hyper-Roof” also houses photovoltaic panels and a rainwater management system that provides the entire structure with energy. As the current layout acclimates to the preexisting landscape, its facade generally remains minimal in style, allowing room for even an amphitheater located near the campus’ main entrance.</p>\n<p>Designer: <a href=\"http://www.perraultarchitecture.com/en/homepage\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dominique Perrault Architecture</a> x <a href=\"https://www.zhubo.com/\"

should serve you well through all of those endeavors. Designed to quite literally be the ATVs of footwear, the Jungle are a pair of shoes that prioritize two things &#8211; the journey, and comfort. They fit around your foot as comfortably as a sock would, and are equipped with a 3D Dual Cushion sole that lets you feel like you&#8217;re walking on air&#8230; even if you&#8217;re scaling mountains. The high-grip outsole gives you remarkable traction, while a special anti-abrasive 3D Mesh fabric made from plastic bottles protects your feet from the elements. With the use of unique materials, and even a few specially located drainage holes, the Jungle shoes can be worn underwater too. Whether you&#8217;re wading through a river or just swimming on the beach, the shoes form an extension of your foot, giving you freedom of movement. Take them off and they dry easily too&#8230; because they were designed to.</p>\n<p>If I had to entrust one company with creating the ultimate outdoor shoe, it would be Tropicfeel. A 26-person design company based out of Barcelona, Tropicfeel has created not one, but two of the most funded shoes on Kickstarter, setting their record in 2018, and then nearly matching it in 2019. With innovation practically woven into the company&#8217;s DNA, Tropicfeel developed the Jungle footwear as the latest evolution to their all-terrain footwear collection.</p>\n<p>Outwardly, the Jungle sneakers embody simplicity, with a design that&#8217;s an urban classic of sorts. The shoes come in four color options with a quick-drying fabric body that fits as comfortably as a sock would. The fabric features an upside-down 3D mesh, designed in collaboration with Ariaprene. The fabric is optimized for abrasion-resistance and long-lasting build quality, while using 7 recycled plastic bottles in its construction (in an effort to eliminate ocean waste). The fabric body is then capped off with special Sprint Laces on top that allow you to easily secure your shoes firmly around your feet, and a revolutionary outsole at its base, giving you the slip-resistance you need, whether you&#8217;re on the tarmac, on tiles, or on terrain.</p>\n<p>The innovation comes naturally to Tropicfeel, but so does focus on sustainability. Each pair of shoes recycles 14 bottles worth of ocean plastic, while even the soles contain 30% recycled EVA foam. By entirely skipping the traditional retail route and focusing on crowdfunding, Tropicfeel can design shoes to order, eliminating the need to store them in shops, pay hefty retail taxes, or warehouse costs across the globe. Moreover, the shoes are durable and built-to-last too. With a classic design and the ability to be worn everywhere (and a lightweight construction that makes them easy to pack), the Tropicfeel Jungle is all set to be the next pair of shoes you&#8217;ll never want to take off!</p>\n<p>Designer: Tropicfeel</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tropicfeel.com/pages/jungle-cf?utm_source=newsletter&#38;utm_medium=Link&#38;utm_campaign=YankoDesigns\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Click Here to Buy Now: $95</strong></a> <del datetime=\"2021-04-01T12:07:49+00:00\">$119</del> (20% off).

The Wingback Mechanical Pencil is an expertly crafted all-metal writing/drawing instrument designed to work seamlessly for decades. Made from high-quality metals with well-engineered tolerances, the Wingback Mechanical Pencil looks premium and feels robust. Like any good piece of stationery, it&#8217;s weighted to give you a comfortable writing and drawing experience, measures a compact 117.5mm to fit perfectly in the crook of your hand, and it&#8217;s built to last&#8230; but its most remarkable feature actually sits under its hood, away from your eyes.</p>\n<p>Unlike most mechanical pencils, the Wingback focuses on the less tangible aspects of performance too. Sure, a pencil should be able to let you draw flowing lines, and let you ideate with relative ease&#8230; but what happens when you suddenly run out of lead in the middle of a sketch? Your thought-flow breaks and you spend a good 2 minutes opening the pencil, emptying the old lead piece out, and adding a new lead piece in. The Wingback Mechanical Pencil circumvents that problem with a cleverly designed interior. The pencil&#8217;s hollow body holds as many as 40 lead refills at a time, and a cleverly designed bespoke mechanism allows new leads to deploy as soon as the old lead finishes, allowing you to continuously write or draw without any break in your flow. In fact, designer Alasdair MacLaine claims that the pencil fits 10x more lead than traditional mechanical pencils, and can continuously write for 50 full kilometers, so you should only have to refill the lead tank a handful of times in a lifetime (that&#8217;s if you&#8217;re a serious sketch-bug!)</p>\n<p>The Wingback Mechanical Pencil is reminiscent of the London-based design studio&#8217;s Mechanical Pen design from 2019. It comes immaculately machined from metal, with three metallic options to choose from &#8211; Brass, Stainless Steel, and Black Steel (featuring a scratch-resistant tungsten carbide surface finish). The gripping area measures a comfortable 10mm in diameter and features a knurled texture that&#8217;s great to look at and even greater to hold.</p>\n<p>Pressing the top of the pencil triggers the unique all-metal propelling mechanism inside, which has been designed by Wingback in England and built specifically for this model by a specialist manufacturer in Japan. This mechanism lets you fit a stunning 2.4 meters worth of lead refills inside, while the clicking action deploys a new refill as soon as the old one finishes. A retractable lead sleeve, activated by holding down the clicker, allows the lead to be pushed back inside the Pencil, and prevents any unwanted lead-wobble as you write, giving you an entirely well-calibrated writing experience from start to end.</p>\n<p>Speaking of &#8216;from start to end&#8217;, that seems to be Wingback&#8217;s underlying philosophy too. Just like its 2019 Mechanical Pen, the Wingback Mechanical Pencil is built to outlast any other stationery you have. Its immaculately designed, engineered, and constructed body is made to last a lifetime (the brass variant should even develop a brilliant patina over the years), and with space for 40 lead refills, the pencil&#8217;s writing capacity will probably outlast your creativity too!</p>\n<p>The brand&#8217;s logo is discreetly engraved along the barrel using a pulsed fiber laser, and each Pencil comes with the option to add up to 50 characters on the reverse, making it an extra personal keepsake. With a subtle nod to its heritage and local construction, MADE IN ENGLAND is also unobtrusively engraved on the Pencil&#8217;s internal compartment. Wingback have also announced that the Mechanical Pencil will be offered with limited edition artist collaborations throughout April, so keep your eye on their campaign for each new release!</p>\n<p>Designer: Alasdair MacLaine of Wingback</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/maclainedesign/a-custom-mechanical-pencil-that-is-built-to-last-a-lifetime?ref=f4amni\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Click Here to Buy Now: $93</strong></a> <del datetime=\"2021-03-31T07:08:28+00:00\">$130</del> (33% off).

alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></a></p>\n<p>A clever system of terracotta tiles with water channels woven between them is proving to be a natural, cost-effective way to reduce energy consumption for cooling down subway stations during the summer. Designed by Intsui Design, the Terracotta Valley Wind hopes to drastically reduce energy consumption in the summer by relying on terracotta&#8217;s naturally occurring evaporative cooling ability. The material is inherently inexpensive and easy to source, while Intsui Design&#8217;s clever tiling design is both eye-catching and functional, earning it a deserved Finalist spot at the LEXUS DESIGN AWARD 2021.</p>\n<p>The way the Terracotta Valley Wind cools spaces is simple and frankly ingenious. Water is fed through channels running through the inside of the tiles. The porous tiles absorb the water, which then evaporates through the outer surface, cooling the tile and the air around it. To circulate this cooled air, the Terracotta Valley Wind ingeniously uses the subway train&#8217;s movement as free energy! The trains whoosh through the station, pushing the cold air around as they go, acting exactly as a bellow pump would. The periodic nature of the train&#8217;s movement completely nullifies the Terracotta Valley Wind&#8217;s electrical needs, making it a cost-effective solution that requires absolutely no energy and emits zero pollution&#8230; while using reclaimed water all along, yet another abundant resource!</p>\n<p>The Terracotta Valley Wind&#8217;s brilliant use of evaporative cooling, reclaimed water, and the moving train&#8217;s wind energy to uniformly cool subway stations makes it the perfect candidate for the LEXUS DESIGN AWARD 2021, aligning wonderfully with its theme of &#8220;Design for a Better Tomorrow&#8221;. Currently in its 9th year, the Lexus Design Award is on a mission to ideate and innovate for a better future for humanity as well as for the planet. With its underlying theme of “Design for a Better Tomorrow”, the awards program looks at solutions that have a uniquely positive impact on society, humanity, and in the process, to reward a new generation of designers for their impactful ideas. Creating the perfect environment for a design to grow, LEXUS helps engineer ideas into real, innovative solutions. Apart from accelerating, developing, and promoting design projects, the Lexus Design Award helps kickstart design careers too, with exclusive mentorships from international design stalwarts like Joe Doucet, Mariam Kamara, Sabine Marcelis and Sputniko!, as well as funding for prototypes (up to 3 million Japanese Yen or $25,000 per project) and the opportunity to have your work judged by the biggest figures in design in the final Grand Prix competition. This year’s judges include Paola Antonelli (Senior Curator at MoMA), Dong Gong (Founder and Principal Designer at Vector Architects), Greg Lynn (Architect and CEO at Piaggio Fast Forward), and Simon Humphries (Head of Toyota and Lexus Global Design).</p>\n<p>The Terracotta Valley Wind is one of the six finalists of the LEXUS DESIGN AWARD 2021.

Terracotta is an inexpensive and accessible clay material. Its nature allows water to quickly evaporate, while utilizing the unused wind resource in subway stations, maximizing the value of train-induced wind.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://discoverlexus.com/experiences/lexus-design-award-2021?utm_source=yankodesign&#38;utm_medium=article0207&#38;utm_campaign=yankodesign_lda2021\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-308697\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/04/water-cooled-terracotta-tiles-provide-natural-cooling-to-subway-stations-during-the-summer/Lexus_Design_Award_2021_Terracotta_Valley_Wind_03.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></a></p>\n<p>The team studied that in a ventilated environment, terracotta’s porous nature allows for water to easily move through the walls, which accelerates the evaporation speed of the water. By transmuting water to air, it absorbs a relatively large amount of heat, effectively reducing the temperature of the environment.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://discoverlexus.com/experiences/lexus-design-award-2021?utm_source=yankodesign&#38;utm_medium=article0207&#38;utm_campaign=yankodesign_lda2021\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-308696\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/04/water-cooled-terracotta-tiles-provide-natural-cooling-to-subway-stations-during-the-summer/Lexus_Design_Award_2021_Terracotta_Valley_Wind_02.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></a></p>\n<p>This principle of terracotta can work perfectly with the train-induced wind and airflow in the subway station. The concept of Terracotta Valley Wind as in-station passive cooling wall is composed of spliced terracotta slabs, with an automatic water supply system consist of stainless steelframe implanted with water pipes. Ideally, the slabs are humidified by reclaimed water, which evaporates faster when the wind is induced by train, and thus to achieve a cooling effect in the subway station. The whole system is pollution-free and does not require any electricity.</p>\n<p><a

href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/tag/robot/\">robot</a> before your first cup of <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/tag/coffee/\">coffee</a>, you’re in good company. Without even fully opening my eyes, I get my first cup of coffee going for the morning, and while it brews I get myself ready. On good days, I turn my stove off on time, and on other days, I gulp down a burnt cup of coffee. Coffee is a necessary part of the day for a lot of us and having that perfect cup in the morning might be all we need to get our day off on the right foot. To save us from those &#8216;other days,&#8217; Beijing’s Orion Star Technology Co. Ltd. recently designed a robotic coffeemaking system, the Zhi Ka Master that was shortlisted at 2021’s iF Design Awards.</p>\n<p>Zhi Ka Master is a coffee-making system that employs the use of twin-arm robotics to perform traditional coffee and tea brewing for hand-poured, automated cups of coffee. The entire system comprises a twin-arm, six-axis robot and accompanying work table. Twin-arm robotic systems are typically chosen for their efficient and automated execution of more involved assembly operations. Through bi-manual manipulation, twin-arm robots can perform complicated tasks in a human-like manner. The incorporation of twin-arm robotics for Zhi Ka Master and a bionic profile design equips the robot with enough know-how to stimulate masterful coffee or tea-making methods with the push of a button. A pre-sized and programmed worktable is used to keep all the machines and tools necessary to make any drink on a typical coffee menu.</p>\n<p>You’re like me if your coffee order comes with some conditions: <em>an extra shot of espresso please and not too much ice</em>. Rest assured, Zhi Ka Master knows how to receive special input for specific coffee orders that veer from the menu. Through integrated software, Zhi Ka Master can make coffee and tea drinks for specific tastes all without human intervention. So maybe, don’t push that button.</p>\n<p>Designer: <a href=\"https://www.orionstar.com/index\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Orion Star Technology Co.

plastics used to build car tires are the same plastics used to make chewing gum. From the moment we spit our gum onto the ground, it will take upwards of 50 years for that one piece to even begin decomposition. Noticing the wasted potential of chewing gum and the harmful effects it poses on the <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/tag/sustainable-design/\">environment</a>, design students Hugo Maupetit and Vivian Fischer decided to collect wads of discarded chewing gum out of which they molded and constructed <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/tag/rubber/\">wheels</a> for skateboards.</p>\n<p>After noticing that discarded chewing gum, made from synthetic rubbers, could be repurposed to construct wheels for skateboards, Maupetit and Fischer visualized a future partnership with Mentos and Vans. In the imagined collaboration, they worked together to take the gum from the streets and bring the gum back to the streets in a sustainable way. “Our initiative is supposed to clean the streets in a sustainable way. That is why we invented a system that will transform used wheels and turn them into new ones,” Maupetit and Fischer explained. “No more waste is created and the material stays in use.”</p>\n<p>Initiating the collaboration, Maupetit and Fischer suggested that ‘gum boards’ be installed throughout their university city of Nantes, where residents could tack their finished chewing gum. As the gum boards filled up, the individual pieces would be collected, cleaned, molded together with a stabilizing agent, and stained with natural dye to form the wheels’ bases. The vibrant color of chewing gum along with its rubbery texture makes it a playful, yet tough choice for tire production.</p>\n<p>People have been chewing on gum since the 1860s, but it was only after World War II that manufacturers began using synthetic rubbers, like polyethylene and polyvinyl acetate to make chewing gum. Plastics, like synthetic rubber, are able to be molded, pressed, and hardened into different shapes, making the building material relatively durable and easy to work with. Plus, there’s no shortage of supply– it’s everywhere.</p>\n<p>Designers: Hugo Maupetit and Vivian Fischer</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-308950\"

It&#8217;s a technique that has gained a lot of momentum, owing to its simple and innovative nature. But designers aren&#8217;t employing 3D printing only to create basic models, they&#8217;re utilizing this technique in mind-blowing ways as well! From 3D printed artificial coral reefs to a menacing automotive design with 3D printed parts, the scope of this dependable technique is unlimited! In fact, did you know, lunar habitats for the moon are being 3D printed as well? There&#8217;s honestly nothing that cannot be 3D printed these days, the possibilities are endless, and we&#8217;re super excited to see what else is in store!

The team from Swire Institute of Marine Science (SWIMS) of the University of Hong Kong (HKU) and its Robotic Fabrication Lab of the faculty of architecture worked together to <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2020/08/05/these-3d-printed-terracotta-tiles-along-hong-kongs-coast-are-designed-to-revive-the-marine-coral-life/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">3D print terra-cotta tiles</a> that will act as artificial reefs. The result is a mesmerizing, organic swirl of line and negative space that reads like a burnt orange topographic map—and mimics the natural patterns of the coral itself. Why terra-cotta? It’s highly porous with “nice surface micro-texture” for marine organisms to latch on to, says team member Dave Baker, and an eco-friendly alternative to conventional materials such as cement or metal, the HKU team says.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/04/MH19_3D_printed_handle.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/04/MH19_3D_printed_handle_01.jpg\" /></p>\n<p class=\"post-without-image\">The shape of the handy tool called <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2020/04/18/the-3d-printed-mh-19-multifunctional-tool-reduces-contact-risk-when-you-step-out-for-essential-items/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">MH-19</a> is inspired by <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/tag/face-mask/\">protection masks</a> and has solved yet another problem using design.

Gloves can be left aside for the healthcare professionals who need them the most while we can use reusable handles like this for our daily essential outdoor tasks. Innovation has the power to be simple yet mighty effective in its purpose. 3D printers are currently a valuable tool in this fight and the global design community is doing everything they can to support the healthcare professionals, engineers as well as the general public through their creativity.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/05/this-futuristic-custom-e-bike-comes-with-an-organic/fuller_moto_majestic_1.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/05/this-futuristic-custom-e-bike-comes-with-an-organic/fuller_moto_majestic_2.jpg\" /></p>\n<p class=\"post-without-image\">The <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2020/05/07/this-futuristic-custom-e-bike-comes-with-organic-3d-printed-details-and-transparent-wheel-rims/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2029 e-bike</a> brings art-deco and automotive design into the future, with its unusual combination of clean-cut geometric shapes brought about by sheet-metal fabrication, along with bone-inspired generative-design details 3D printed in metal. The bike is an amalgamation of styles that pays a hat-tip to the revolutionary design of the 1929 Majestic, built by George Roy. Ninety years later, Bryan Fuller and his team at Fuller Moto decided to push boundaries with bike design. Created as a commissioned piece for the Haas Moto Museum and Sculpture Gallery, the bike incorporates design trends and technologies that are indicative of the future of automotive design. The stunning 2029 comes with an electric drivetrain, fully enclosed aluminum body, hub-centric steering, transparent PolyCarbonate wheels, and 3D printed bike parts, furnished out of Titanium.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/can-niveas-3d-printed-shower-gel-refill-station-prototype-really-reduce-plastic-packaging-waste/01-nivea_yankodesign.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/can-niveas-3d-printed-shower-gel-refill-station-prototype-really-reduce-plastic-packaging-waste/09-nivea_yankodesign.jpg\" /></p>\n<p class=\"post-without-image\">NIVEA’s parent company is German giant Beiersdorf and they are on a mission to reduce packaging waste by minimizing and closing their material cycles. And for NIVEA that meant launching a shower gel refill station! Now it is a good first step and has its pros but also has some cons. The biggest con is that shower gels themselves are not good for the environment and there is no way to know how many bottles actually get rinsed clean before they are recycled – otherwise, it doesn’t work. Shower gels also need a lot of water to be made, and as climate change makes the world hotter/drier, the water crisis is already a big issue in many countries. A solution to that? Bar soaps! NIVEA makes those too, they use less water and can be packaged in the recycled paper – that is the real solution but if this <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2020/08/13/can-niveas-3d-printed-shower-gel-refill-station-prototype-really-reduce-plastic-packaging-waste/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">refill station</a> reduces some plastic waste and sparks a movement for the brand to take bigger steps, then we are here to see it. The prototype is going to be tested in select locations where the brand will gather data on how consumers are interacting, feeling, reacting to the concept of reusable bottles. The prototype machine was made with their in-house 3D printers<em>. </em>NIVEA hopes that with this refill station they will make it convenient for consumers to reuse containers and reduce plastic usage.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/09/auto-draft/coral_lighting_collection_1.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/09/auto-draft/coral_lighting_collection_2.jpg\" /></p>\n<p class=\"post-without-image\">Say hello to Timor, Sargasso, and Celebes, three members of <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2020/09/25/these-3d-printed-lamps-were-designed-using-algorithms-that-copy-coral-growth-patterns/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">John’s Coral Lighting Collection</a>. Inspired by different styles of corals, the lamps come with varying aesthetics that reflect the visual characteristics of each coral type. The way John went about creating these unique lights was to first develop the computational design algorithms that mimic growth patterns found in nature. “The lighting collection is my way of paying tribute to the beauty of the ocean. As a veteran surfer, I’ve experienced the power and beauty of the ocean while enjoying each wave as its own unique moment in time. One of many magical living structures in our great oceans is coral. With a diverse range of colors, shapes, and scales, coral is an entire ecosystem of thriving life. My lighting celebrates this life”, says Mauriello.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/05/this-3d-printed-structure-prevents-your-face-mask-from-collapsing-as-you-breathe/cannula_mask_1.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/05/this-3d-printed-structure-prevents-your-face-mask-from-collapsing-as-you-breathe/cannula_mask_5.jpg\" /></p>\n<p class=\"post-without-image\">What we really need is for everyone to wear face-masks that prevent the transmission of germs. What we DON’T need is for those face-masks to make it harder for us to breathe, right? As you inhale, most flimsy fabric masks collapse inwards because of the negative air pressure created inside the mask… it’s honestly something most people can deal with, but if you’re someone with pre-existing respiratory difficulties, it could make regular breathing rather difficult. <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2020/05/13/this-3d-printed-structure-prevents-your-face-mask-from-collapsing-as-you-breathe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Cannula mask</a> avoids this problem with its reinforcing endoskeleton. A thin plastic grille, this skeleton gives the mask its defining structure, preventing it from pressing against your face the same way a hanger prevents clothes from getting crushed by retaining its shape. Designed to be worn by people with respiratory difficulties, the endoskeleton even comes with a hollow spine that allows you to plug a nasal cannula into it, letting you direct fresh oxygen right to the wearer’s nose; effectively allowing them to inhale and exhale freely without worrying about a flimsy mask smothering them every time they try to breathe.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2019/04/auto-draft/sandvik_unbreakable_guitar_1.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2019/04/auto-draft/sandvik_unbreakable_guitar_2.jpg\" /></p>\n<p class=\"post-without-image\">A lot of moments in rock history are defined by the iconic guitar-smash… and while I personally don’t think it’s particularly nice to smash musical equipment, what if you designed a guitar that, if you look at the image immediately below, couldn’t be smashed? That’s what Sandvik decided to do. Designed to show off their advanced titanium additive printing techniques (and also their engineering prowess), they designed the <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2019/04/16/this-3d-printed-metal-guitar-is-absolutely-indestructible/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">world’s first guitar that can’t be smashed</a>. Literally. Many have even tried, including rockstar Yngwie Malmsteen, who managed to wreck his stage amps and monitors but couldn’t get the guitar to even as much as deform. Sandvik partnered with guitar-designer Andy Holt over what sounds like a pretty unusual design brief… Designing an electric guitar that was virtually indestructible, but also sounded incredibly good. The design process included hours of analyzing footage of guitars being smashed (many by Malmsteen himself) to analyze the biggest points of weaknesses.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/Lytte_HarmoniQ_worlds_first_3D_acoustic_earbuds_hero.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/these-3d-printed-tws-earbuds-were-designed-to-provide-incredible-sound-and-a-perfect-fit/Lytte_HarmoniQ_worlds_first_3D_acoustic_earbuds_01.jpg\" /></p>\n<p class=\"post-without-image\"><a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2020/08/06/these-3d-printed-tws-earbuds-were-designed-to-provide-incredible-sound-and-a-perfect-fit/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The TWS earphones’</a> unique shape comes with a specially designed 3D acoustic chamber that helps make the audio sound richer, with better, more distinct basslines… while also helping reduce sound distortion as well as providing organic noise isolation of up to -35 db, allowing it to rival the Airpods Pro’s active noise cancellation tech just through its ergonomic design. The amount of careful consideration built into the Lytte HarmoniQ is truly remarkable. Each earphone casing is meticulously 3D printed using DLP printing tech (a feature that allows it to have that unique acoustic chamber shape) and hand-polished to look as remarkable as it does. Just like most smart earphones, the Lytte HarmoniQ supports iOS as well as Android integration, with the ability to tap, double-tap, and long-press to control music playback as well as smartphone functions (including summoning the phone’s voice AI).</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/03/this-credit-card-sized-antenna-turns-5g-signals-into-wireless-power-for-iot-devices/3D-printed-5G-wave-harnessing-antenna-by-Georgia-Institute-of-Technology-ATHENA-lab_1.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/03/this-credit-card-sized-antenna-turns-5g-signals-into-wireless-power-for-iot-devices/3D-printed-5G-wave-harnessing-antenna-by-Georgia-Institute-of-Technology-ATHENA-lab-4.jpg\" /></p>\n<p class=\"post-without-image\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Harvesting abundant sources of </span><a class=\"editor-rtfLink\" href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/tag/renewable-energy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">renewable energy</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> and then converting them into something valuable has been the quest humankind has been on for decades.

somehow unrelated to the digital realms. Be it entertainment while at home or commuting in our vehicles. Especially in the case of <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/category/automotive/\">cars</a>, manufacturers are making a swift move towards a connected environment, and future-forward interiors that are laden with <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/category/technology/\">technology</a>. On the flip side, for people who crave minimalism and peace of mind, it can be a cliché – something that HS Pforzheim MA student Oscar Johansson wants to address with his Volvo Haven concept car penned in collaboration with the <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/tag/volvo/\">Volvo</a> Design team as a part of his thesis project.</p>\n<p>Oscar has taken a bold detour from the cult belief of stuffing modern-day cars with tech-savvy upgrades – virtually treading the opposing direction, taking us back to the ways of nature, and a private space where you can finally feel at peace after a grueling week. The futuristic AWD electric car is devoid of any fancy digital dashboard displays or screens to keep up with all the HUD details about the surroundings of the car. Volvo Haven has a UX tunnel enclosure right in the middle running the length of the car that houses plants, algae, and moss which grow naturally since there are opening at each end to let in the elements – rain, snow, pollen, frost, slush or dirt. The self-driving lounge car minus any steering input or the usual vehicular aids is all about relaxing as your travel for a much needed digital detox.</p>\n<p>Most of the car has transparent body paneling, including the transparent gull-winged doors for an ultra-airy feel. Volvo Haven adopts an aerodynamic design on the outside highlighted by the sweeping lines, lending the vehicle a very charming personality overall. Those elements look somewhat similar to the <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2021/03/14/this-edgy-volvo-lounge-car-redefines-autonomous-luxury-travel-of-the-future/\">Volvo concept car by Roman Zenin</a> which also adopts a very airy element with a focus on the lounging experience. The fat wheel configuration makes us presume it is a performance concept ready for any thrilling skirmish after the relaxing ride for the most part of the journey. Overall, an intuitive concept car design that embodies the aspect of bringing nature inside while driving.</p>\n<p>Designer: Oscar Johansson and Volvo Design</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full

designs have been taking the design world by storm! Especially with COVID-19 restricting us to our homes, building things purely with our hands, putting our sweat and grit into it, and watching a design roar to life in front of our eyes, has become the new pass time for many of us. But these DIY designs are more than just your run-of-the-mill products made using discarded water bottles, and paper! These are innovative, complex, and highly functional designs that cater to a variety of our needs, but are also really simple to put together. It&#8217;s the best of both worlds. From a sustainable helmet made from mushroom to a futuristic PC design, each of these nifty designs will get your creative juices flowing, your hands moving, as well as definitely add some value to your life. Which of these unique DIY designs would you try building at home?!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/12/293284/02-grow_helmet_yankodesign.gif\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/12/293284/04-grow_helmet_yankodesign.gif\" /></p>\n<p class=\"post-without-image\">This mushroom helmet will grow on you as it grows. Yes, read this slowly and carefully: this mushroom helmet will grow on you as it grows. “What do you mean?!” you say and I assure you that statement is not wrong, there is an explanation for it. <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2020/12/19/this-sustainable-helmet-is-a-diy-design-made-from-mushrooms-grows-on-its-own/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Grow It Yourself Helmet</a> is a sustainable product made from <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2020/02/19/nasa-plans-to-use-mushrooms-to-build-sustainable-housing-on-mars-like-this-one/\">mycelium</a> which is the vegetative part of a fungus. Mycelium is the thready hyphae that are tightly woven into mass branch-like networks making it a strong sustainable material. The network of filaments are natural binders and they also are self-adhesive to the surface they grow on. The entire process is based on biological elements that help in upcycling waste. The process of making this helmet also gets the kids involved in a meaningful activity that teaches them about sustainability and safety.”We have developed a helmet that can be made out of hay and Mycelium. It is 100% compostable, breathable, and impact resistant. The helmet reduces the use of plastics in a product that will be disposed of in a short time due to the child’s growth rate,” says the team at NOS Design.</p>\n<p class=\"post-without-image\"><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/12/these-removable-modular-pieces-make-it-easy-to-upgrade-your-pc/Modular-Workstation-Computer_Philipp-Seissler_electronic-gadgets-monitor_hero.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/12/build-and/1_Modular-Workstation-Computer_Philipp-Seissler_electronic-gadgets-monitor.jpg\" /></p>\n<p class=\"post-without-image\">Now, some tech companies, like Apple, will buy back your older models in exchange for store credit. However, why replace a product when you can upcycle it? <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2020/12/22/diy-building-block-like-components-make-up-this-futuristic-pc-design/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Modular Workstation Computer</a> offers an alternative device that would make this process easier. The computer’s internal hardware – its processor, memory, etc. – is attached to a tray of large, cube-like pieces that can be pulled off and reattached. This design choice is a huge departure from standard laptops, which tuck their hardware inside the body of the computer, requiring you to unscrew the bottom plate to access it. This inconvenience may discourage consumers from learning more about how their computer works – and how they might use that knowledge to extend the life of their device. The Modular Workstation Computer presents a better solution: one that reduces long-term costs and environmental impact.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/03/this-diy-tiny-home-comes-partially-assembled-and-as-easy-to-put-together-as-your-ikea-furniture/EcoNodome_tinyhome_yankodesign_hero-1.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/03/307882/4-econodome.jpg\" /></p>\n<p class=\"post-without-image\">Dubbed as <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2021/03/29/this-diy-tiny-home-comes-partially-assembled-and-as-easy-to-put-together-as-your-ikea-furniture/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">EconOdome</a>, each structure’s frame and triangle panel kits come pre-cut and partially assembled with detailed instructions – so better than IKEA and you get a whole home instead of just a couch! EconOdome homes are built similarly to conventional homes involving a foundation and the main floor. Once that is in place, the vertical walls and roof is added in. There are 130 triangular roofing elements that connect to form the dome which has 10 equal sides. To minimize waste, parts in the DIY kit are cut to fit precisely with no additional work required on that end. The wood also comes with pre-drilled holes for stainless steel screws and caps to make assembling it super easy. The company’s 26-foot fully insulated model is sold for about $18,000 and their smaller 13-foot option is an option for those working within a more reasonable budget. The two-story larger model spans just over 800 square feet and comes with a fully equipped kitchen on the first floor and a bedroom on the top floor.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/01/jukebox-inside-a-vintage-mercedes-benz-engine-compartment-is-dope-for-vinyl-fanatics/Mercedes-Benz-220-Jukebox-DIY-2.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/01/jukebox-inside-a-vintage-mercedes-benz-engine-compartment-is-dope-for-vinyl-fanatics/Mercedes-Benz-220-Jukebox-DIY-3.jpg\" /></p>\n<p class=\"post-without-image\">Designed by British performance art troupe Mutoid Waste Company way back in the 1980s, this piece of <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/tag/DIY/\">DIY</a> is well worth its weight in gold. Music lovers who settle for nothing less than 45 rpm records playing on their vinyl record player or a turntable are surely going to drool all over this creation. Christened <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2021/01/05/this-vintage-mercedes-benz-engine-compartment-holds-a-diy-jukebox-for-retro-lovers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the Mercedes-Benz 220 Jukebox</a>, I bet you would not have seen anything like this before. Owning it is a far cry now as it’s already been auctioned for a fat sum of $2,500. But the jukebox fitted inside the front end of a vintage Mercedes-Benz 220 SE is not something you get to see every day. It doubles as a jaw-dropping installation in the living room and when it’s time to listen to some music, one opens the hood and plays the favorite record player for pure bliss.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/03/auto-draft/13_pulpethouse_taesungyoon_cathouse.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/03/auto-draft/02_pulpethouse_taesungyoon_cathouse.jpg\" /></p>\n<p class=\"post-without-image\">Taesung Yoon designed <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2021/03/16/this-diy-paper-cat-house-makes-a-quirky-hiding-place-fit-for-your-feline-friends/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pulpet</a>, a DIY paper cat house. Pulpet initially consists of eco-friendly paper cutouts, which are ultimately handcrafted and put together to assemble a cat house in the shape of a geometric, sitting cat. Users can easily assemble Pulpet without any additional building components. Prepared with all the necessary contents for assembly, Pulpet is easily constructed by adhering the geometric faces together to form the shape of a cat. If like me, the shape of a cat doesn’t readily come to your creative eye, an assembly manual comes included with the paper house cutouts. To make Pulpet eco-friendly, Taesung Yoon sourced FSC-certified paper material harvested from forests that are responsibly managed and environmentally conscious.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/03/255830/06_CeliaPerahSpeaker_yankodesign.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/03/255830/03_CeliaPerahSpeaker_yankodesign.jpg\" /></p>\n<p class=\"post-without-image\">Celia &#38; Perah has built a detailed laser-cut assembly that is easy to follow for even the new DIY enthusiast – Meet <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2020/03/26/this-diy-bluetooth-radio-kit-is-perfect-for-those-who-love-to-tinker/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the Classic Bluetooth Radio</a>. Taking roughly an hour to assemble, the kit consists of one 3″ full-range speaker, a 4″passive radiator, laser cut wood boards, a PCB, battery antenna, and other small items required to assemble this design. Do not be deceived by its rustic looks, the speaker is amped with modern functionalities such as Bluetooth connectivity, USB and AUX inputs as well as an FM radio function! The end result is a vintage-inspired radio with modern sound capabilities that can last up to 5.5 hours of plug-free playing. There are 2 variants of the speaker black or white with the existing wooden body, so you can choose the one that matches your space.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/09/you-can-now-build-your-own-wooden-tiny-cabin-diy-style-with-this-flatpack-design/08-kabinka_yankodesign.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/09/you-can-now-build-your-own-wooden-tiny-cabin-diy-style-with-this-flatpack-design/02-kabinka_yankodesign.jpg\" /></p>\n<p class=\"post-without-image\">A Hungarian company called Hello Wood has designed a tiny minimalist cabin that you can assemble yourself for creative space solutions or just an escape from your living room. The prefabricated cabins start at $10,200 and have been crafted in a way that anyone can put it together, it is truly the ultimate DIY project. With the tiny home market ‘growing’ rapidly, <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2020/09/18/this-diy-tiny-wooden-cabin-comes-with-a-scandinavian-aesthetic-and-a-flatpack-design/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the Kabinka cabin</a> is positioned to be like IKEA furniture – easy to assemble with an aesthetic that is loved by most. The Kabinka cabin comes in four sizes that range between 129 and 215 square feet. It is a tiny cabin but it has high ceilings – over 12 feet high actually – that bring a sense of spaciousness and luxury to the otherwise simple structure. The ceiling space is well optimized to give the cabin a loft-like setup that can be used as storage space or a cozy reading nook. Another cool thing about Kabinka is that it is a flatpack design! You can also customize it to suit your needs – it can be a private backyard workstation or a mini weekend holiday home without the heavy price tag (since you assemble it, it brings down the costs!).</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2019/06/auto-draft/ahadrone_kit_1.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2019/06/auto-draft/ahadrone_kit_2.jpg\" /></p>\n<p class=\"post-without-image\">I love the Ahadrone kit’s DIY touch! Designed to be the “drone for everyone”, it democratizes one of the hottest (and sometimes expensive) categories in consumer electronics. With all the makings of a very capable drone,<a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2019/06/06/first-we-had-diy-cardboard-vr-headsets-now-weve-got-diy-cardboard-drones/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> the Ahadrone</a> is just like any other remote-controlled quadcopter, but it comes with a complete corrugated board body, allowing it to stay light, but stiff, the perfect property for a drone exterior! Cardboard isn’t new to consumer electronics. The Google Cardboard VR headset, and the cardboard Nintendo Switch Labo kits, have both showcased paper board to be a very capable low-cost solution to plastic parts. The board serves as a great packaging material too, knocking two birds with one stone.. and while it isn’t as permanent as plastic (the Ahadrone wouldn’t last 5 minutes in the rain), with the right template, people can rebuild their own cardboard parts, either out of the board, plastic sheets, or even 3D printing them!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/01/draft-tiny-tv/tinycircuits_diy_tinytv_1.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/agV2NVg.gif\" width=\"1050&#34;\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2021/01/05/this-fully-functional-diy-mini-television-is-the-size-of-a-coin-and-it-has-its-own-remote/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The TinyTV</a> comes as a DIY kit that assembles easily in less than 5 minutes with no soldering or special tools required. It runs off a MicroSD card, allowing you to play back up to 5 hours of content (in MP4 format) on the TV’s ridiculously small screen. The TinyTV also comes along with its own TinyRemote with 6 adorable little buttons to power the TV on, change channels, adjust the volume, and even mute the television (I wonder how loud the speakers on the TV are). The TV’s 3D-printed enclosure is designed to resemble old-timey cathode-ray tube tellies from the 70s… and even though it’s printed in white filament, you can easily give it a quick paint-job with some acrylic paints. Don’t use a spray-paint can though, you might just blow the damn thing away!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/12/290676/19_InvisiblePC_MatthewPerks_DesktopWithIntegratedPC.png\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/12/290676/20_InvisiblePC_MatthewPerks_DesktopWithIntegratedPC.png\" /></p>\n<p class=\"post-without-image\">Matt, of YouTube’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUQo7nzH1sXVpzL92VesANw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DIY Perks</a>, has his own ideas to pass the time with quarantine. That’s to say, he built <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2020/12/16/diy-invisible-pc-design-with-this-masterclass-to-build-a-desk-that-hides-an-entire-pc-operating-system/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">an invisible PC</a>. Well, he constructed a desk with an interior that stows away a fully-operative hardware system for desktop computers. The outer shell of his invisible PC consists of two main materials: hardwood and aluminum sheeting. Matt used two sheets of aluminum to give his desk structure since they are less than half the thickness of wooden materials and can produce a bend-free design. In order to achieve this, Matt placed wooden beams along the perimeter of one of the two sheets of aluminum, drilled pilot holes, into which he inserted machine screws for a secure attachment. With the insertion of wooden beams along the perimeter, the desk has an interior space with a height of 44 millimeters, which is just enough to contain the components needed for PC operation, AKA the nitty-gritty hardware business.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/yankodesign?a=DIvvVwFlE6c:AuaBxTNm400:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img
