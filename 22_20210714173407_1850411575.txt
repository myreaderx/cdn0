He said he expects the price of the commodity to moderate, especially as supply chains normalize and recover after the last year of the pandemic. </p><p>By the end of August and into early September, he told Insider the price of lumber may settle between $350-$450 per thousand board feet due to a confluence of factors, including sawmills slowly reopening and vaccination rates rising.</p><p>And while Merkel still sees headwinds for the industry, especially when it comes to labor, he said he is optimistic the market will normalize by the end of the year. </p><p>Experts, including Merkel, have long sounded the alarm of a chronic shortage of affordable and available homes in the US.</p><p>&#34;People took for granted the prices of lumber,&#34; Merkel told Insider.</p><p>The spike in the price of lumber on its own has added $36,000 to the average price of a new home, according to the National Association of Home Builders<strong>.</strong></p><p>A <a href=\"https://cdn.nar.realtor/sites/default/files/documents/Housing-is-Critical-Infrastructure-Social-and-Economic-Benefits-of-Building-More-Housing-6-15-2021.pdf\">June 2021 report</a> by the Rosen Consulting Group, a real estate economics consulting firm, found that more than two million housing units need to be built per year in the next decade in order to fill an underbuilding gap of at least 5.5 million housing units.</p><p>Homebuilding would need to accelerate to a pace that is well above the current trend, the study said. </p><p>But for some, like David Russell, VP of market intelligence at TradeStation Group, an online broker-dealer, the whole market &#34;distortion&#34; of lumber was an aberration caused by the pandemic.</p><p>&#34;I think in some ways lumber is really just toilet paper, 2.0. It&#39;s just a symptom of a totally weird situation that has almost never happened in history,&#34; he told Insider. &#34;This recession was caused by something totally external.&#34;</p><p>Russell said prices will normalize by the end of the year, though he does not think they will return to pre-pandemic level.</p><p>&#34;The likelihood of this happening again is very low,&#34; he said. &#34;This happened exactly because no one thought it was going to happen.&#34;</p><p>A number of commodities have surged in part because of distorted supply chains during the pandemic, but lumber in particular has captured people&#39;s attention. When asked why people have been focused on lumber over other commodities, Merkel said: &#34;At the end of the day, people need a place to live. Housing has a personal feel, whether you&#39;re an analyst or a prospective homebuyer.&#34;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/lumber-price-today-outlook-august-analyst-commodities-prices-2021-7'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=r4umruMGgqI:R3iyTCxgx8I:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=r4umruMGgqI:R3iyTCxgx8I:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=r4umruMGgqI:R3iyTCxgx8I:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=r4umruMGgqI:R3iyTCxgx8I:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=r4umruMGgqI:R3iyTCxgx8I:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=r4umruMGgqI:R3iyTCxgx8I:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=r4umruMGgqI:R3iyTCxgx8I:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=r4umruMGgqI:R3iyTCxgx8I:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/r4umruMGgqI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 14 Jul 2021 17:27:47 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/60ef0b2961b8600019f170cc?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"898828fb2066fd8e92d3c0dd3074316d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn41@2020_3/2021/07/14/17-34-05-131_dc6073a45b2fd8da.webp","destWidth":3411,"destHeight":2558,"sourceBytes":1175196,"destBytes":1175196,"author":"ilee@insider.com (Isabelle Lee)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/60deef7a4a93e200191299a8?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn57@2020_6/2021/07/14/17-34-02-004_5950c293afce4245.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn5@2020_2/2021/07/14/17-34-04-185_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=r4umruMGgqI:R3iyTCxgx8I:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn54@2020_3/2021/07/14/17-34-04-213_2393bb7470e8b7bb.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=r4umruMGgqI:R3iyTCxgx8I:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn27@2020_1/2021/07/14/17-34-00-909_8e502f6d5f147f5e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn85@2020_2/2021/07/14/17-34-02-502_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=r4umruMGgqI:R3iyTCxgx8I:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn98@2020_4/2021/07/14/17-34-04-091_5b0362284736dc67.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/r4umruMGgqI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn25@2020_1/2021/07/14/17-34-04-768_1d62b0e960f48a8d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1626284019900},{"createdTime":"2021-07-15 01:33:39","updatedTime":"2021-07-15 01:33:39","title":"TikTok just hit a critical milestone only Facebook has been able to achieve","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/tiktok-facebook-3-billion-app-downloads-popularity-users-whatsapp-instagram-2021-7","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60ef0bbd61b8600019f170d1?format=jpeg\" alt=\"a side by side shows mark zuckerberg and Bytedance CEO zhang yiming\" height=\"1035\" width=\"1380\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and TikTok parent company Bytedance CEO Zhang Yiming.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Liu Jie/Xinhua via Getty) (Xinhua/Liu Jie via Getty Images; Zheng Shuai/VCG via Getty Images; Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>TikTok has been downloaded three billion times around the globe.</li>\n<li>Facebook and its WhatsApp, Instagram, and Messenger are the only other non-game apps to hit that mark.</li>\n<li>TikTok reaching that milestone proves Facebook isn&#39;t the only app people don&#39;t want to live without.</li>\n<li id=\"recirc\"><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">See more stories on Insider&#39;s business page</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>TikTok has been downloaded more than three billion times around the world.</p><p>That&#39;s a milestone that only Facebook and its cohort of apps have reached, showing the social media giant isn&#39;t the only app people can&#39;t live without.</p><p>According to new <a href=\"https://sensortower.com/blog/tiktok-downloads-3-billion\">Sensor Tower</a> data, TikTok is the fifth non-game app to ever surpass the three billion install mark.

She believes that any aspiring professional has the ability to achieve their career goals even if they&#39;re confronted with societal barriers.</p><p>&#34;I come from a very humble family in São Paulo, Brazil,&#34; Yockelson told Insider. &#34;I had to overcome a lot of adversities in the beginning.&#34;</p><p>She advises job seekers in every industry to follow these three pieces of advice.</p><h2><strong style=\"color: #000000;\">1. Build your confidence professionally and personally</strong></h2><p>&#34;Believe that no matter where you start from - no matter how limited your resources are or how victimized you are by institutionalized racism - there&#39;s a way forward and a strength in you that will show,&#34; Yockelson said.</p><p>Experts suggest that low levels of confidence <a href=\"https://www.foxbusiness.com/features/how-confidence-affects-employment-and-the-job-hunt\">negatively impact your career</a>, especially if you&#39;re a recent graduate.</p><p>To build confidence as a person and professional, consider first embracing your past accomplishments, identifying your weaknesses, and strengthening your resume. Other suggestions include:</p><ul><li aria-level=\"1\">Learning how to align the skill set, achievements, and knowledge you&#39;ve already developed with the requirements of the role you seek</li><li aria-level=\"1\">Highlighting the skills or certifications that you lack and identifying ways to formally improve them</li><li aria-level=\"1\">Continuing to enhance your resume through freelance projects and volunteering</li><li aria-level=\"1\">Seeking out support from peers to help you remain on-track to achieving your goals</li><li aria-level=\"1\">When feeling lost, consider taking aptitude tests to help you refocus on your unique motivational drivers, expositional traits, and learning style</li></ul><h2><strong>2. Utilize free resources</strong></h2><p>Yockelson recently earned her doctorate in business administration. &#34;Education, I truly believe in my case, has opened doors,&#34; she said.</p><p>The pandemic has expanded online opportunities and free resources. Princeton, Harvard, and Yale are among the many universities that offer <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/free-online-courses-from-best-colleges#1-princeton-university-1\">online courses through edX and Coursera</a>, which also features courses led by companies like Google Cloud.</p><p>Yockelson insists that job seekers keep in mind that academia isn&#39;t the sole provider of education.

The framework is concentrated on physical items like roads and bridges. It also contains funding for broadband internet, a major priority for both parties.</p><p>There doesn&#39;t appear to be a lot of enthusiasm among Republicans to back the agreement yet, which could partly stem from the fact that negotiators are still turning the blueprint into a formal bill. Democrats are pressing to finalize the details this week, but Republicans say a bill won&#39;t be ready until next week.</p><p>A total of 11 GOP senators signed onto the bipartisan agreement, which would be enough for the plan to clear the 60-vote threshold if every Democratic senator voted for it as well.</p><p>But some have signaled they could withdraw their support given that Democrats are poised to advance a separate $3.5 trillion party-line package through reconciliation in the coming weeks. That legislative pathway requires Democrats to stick together in an evenly-divided Senate over united Republican opposition - and both measures would be approved on parallel tracks.</p><p>&#39;This deal is troublesome to me,&#34; said Sen. Jerry Moran of Kansas, a GOP sponsor, on Wednesday.</p><p>Others say they don&#39;t want the bipartisan deal&#39;s fate to be tied to the Democrat-only plan. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has insisted the House will only approve a bipartisan bill once the Senate clears a party-line infrastructure bill. &#34;They certainly can&#39;t be connected,&#34; Sen. Lindsay Graham, another Republican sponsor, told reporters on Wednesday.</p><p>Republicans have also started criticizing the funding mechanisms, potentially making it harder for more Republicans to support an agreement.</p><p>Some experts <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/biden-republican-bipartisan-infrastructure-plan-paid-for-pixie-dust-2021-6\">are skeptical</a> that the funding provisions of the bipartisan deal - which include repurposing coronavirus relief funds and unspent federal unemployment aid - will fully pay for itself. Howard Gleckman, a tax expert at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, called it &#34;pixie dust&#34; <a href=\"https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/paying-infrastructure-pixie-dust\">in a recent blog post.</a></p><p>The GOP is seizing on that given their opposition to growing the national debt. Sen. John Cornyn of Texas said in a Tuesday interview that Republicans want &#34;just to make sure the pay-fors are responsible, actually real and not illusory,&#34; he said.</p><p>Sen. John Thune, the second-ranked Senate Republican, told reporters on Tuesday that a plan that&#39;s fully paid for would be a &#34;prerequisite for a lot of Republicans to support it.&#34;</p><p>A day later, Thune said that <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/senate-democrats-reach-deal-reconciliation-package-2021-7\">the $3.5 trillion spending deal</a> could &#34;put downward pressure on Republican votes&#34; in the weeks ahead.</p><p>&#34;I don&#39;t think it helps.

Roughly two decades later, the US is ending its military operations but the war on terror rages on.</p><p>The &#34;global war on terror&#34; that was launched by the Bush administration has killed over 800,000 people in direct war violence and led to the displacement of at least 37 million, according to a report from Brown University&#39;s Costs of War project. The federal government also places the cost of the war on terror at <a href=\"https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/\" data-analytics-module=\"summary_bullets\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"0\" data-uri=\"d63308060dc9c818adeaa8876dd29711\">over $6.4 trillion.</a>  </p><p>The war on terror remains among the most controversial aspects of Bush&#39;s legacy, and scholars have widely characterized it as <a href=\"https://www.cato.org/policy-analysis/step-back-lessons-us-foreign-policy-failed-war-terror\">a major failure</a> that <a href=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/afghanistan/2020-10-22/us-foreign-policy-never-recovered-war-terror#author-info\">damaged US credibility</a> around the world.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f57eed1e6ff30001d4e79df?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Mission Accomplished\" height=\"1125\" width=\"2000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Bush delivering a speech to crew aboard the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, as the carrier steamed toward San Diego, California on May 1, 2003.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Larry Downing/Reuters</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><h2>Biden continues to defend the Afghanistan withdrawal as the Taliban makes gains</h2><p>The human and economic cost of the conflict is a large part of the reason Biden, who as a senator voted in favor of the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/biden-backs-congress-post-911-laws-led-to-forever-wars-2021-3\">laws that paved the way for war on terror</a>, has moved to end US involvement in Afghanistan.</p><p>Proponents of the withdrawal say it&#39;s long overdue, and that the US has already lost too many lives and resources in the country. Opponents of the pullout say it&#39;s too hasty and will effectively hand the country to militants on a silver platter. The Taliban recently said it&#39;s taken over <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-europe-middle-east-afghanistan-taliban-c119addda2138516b40d42567e5742cd\">85% of the country&#39;s territory,</a> though it&#39;s difficult to verify this. <a href=\"https://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2021/07/afghanistan-at-risk-of-collapse-as-taliban-storms-the-north.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" aria-label=\"according to The Foundation for Defense of Democracies (opens in a new window)\">According to The Foundation for Defense of Democracies,</a> the Taliban currently controls 195 of the country&#39;s 407 districts and is contesting another 129.</p><p>There are serious concerns about the ability of the Afghan military to maintain control of the country and prevent the Taliban from taking over. Almost as soon as US troops in early July departed from Bagram, the largest air base in the country, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/looters-ransacked-bagram-airbase-afghanistan-as-soon-as-us-left-2021-7\">it was ransacked by looters</a>. Control of the airbase was transferred over to the Afghan military, but local officials claimed the US did not coordinate with them and left in the dead of the night. </p><p>Earlier this week, CNN released video footage of <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/video-shows-taliban-executing-22-afghan-commandos-cnn-2021-7\">22 Afghan commandos being executed</a> by the Taliban as they attempted to surrender. Responding to this report, GOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger, a US Air Force veteran who flew missions in Afghanistan, tweeted, &#34;This is horrible - yet it&#39;s the reality of announcing the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. Removing the peacekeepers and leaving the Afghan people without support is a grave mistake, Mr. President.&#34;</p><p>Meanwhile, the Taliban continues to make gains as local militias pop up to challenge it, propelling the country further and further into a state of civil war. </p><p>On Friday, Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby acknowledged the <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2021/07/09/pentagon-warning-taliban-advances-498924\">&#34;deteriorating security situation&#34;</a> in Afghanistan, just one day after Biden gave a full-throated defense of the withdrawal.</p><p>The president announced the pullout in April, and last week said the US military mission in the country would be complete by the end of August. Biden has rejected the notion a Taliban takeover of the country is inevitable in the absence of US troops, expressing confidence in the Afghan military&#39;s capacity to keep the insurgents at bay.</p><p>&#34;We did not go to Afghanistan to nation-build. And it&#39;s the right and the responsibility of the Afghan people alone to decide their future and how they want to run their country,&#34; <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/07/08/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-drawdown-of-u-s-forces-in-afghanistan/\">Biden said</a> in an impassioned speech. &#34;Nearly 20 years of experience has shown us that the current security situation only confirms that &#39;just one more year&#39; of fighting in Afghanistan is not a solution but a recipe for being there indefinitely.&#34; </p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/george-w-bush-warns-biden-afghanistan-opens-door-for-slaughter-2021-7'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=bBmkzxcvUSk:zqDDlmeVJ6M:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=bBmkzxcvUSk:zqDDlmeVJ6M:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=bBmkzxcvUSk:zqDDlmeVJ6M:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=bBmkzxcvUSk:zqDDlmeVJ6M:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=bBmkzxcvUSk:zqDDlmeVJ6M:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=bBmkzxcvUSk:zqDDlmeVJ6M:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=bBmkzxcvUSk:zqDDlmeVJ6M:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=bBmkzxcvUSk:zqDDlmeVJ6M:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/bBmkzxcvUSk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 14 Jul 2021 15:22:44 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/60eeef9461b8600019f16ff3?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"f740e809ad74187c622ab5ee10b6ac09","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn61@2020_2/2021/07/14/17-34-00-936_3548980d7f8295f9.webp","destWidth":1788,"destHeight":1341,"sourceBytes":93784,"destBytes":93784,"author":"insider@insider.com (John Haltiwanger)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/60eeef9a61b8600019f16ff4?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn93@2020_2/2021/07/14/17-34-03-388_d5efa36a8aeacc49.webp","https://i.insider.com/5f57eed1e6ff30001d4e79df?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn69@2020_4/2021/07/14/17-34-03-344_211efc2acaf567bb.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn5@2020_2/2021/07/14/17-34-04-185_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=bBmkzxcvUSk:zqDDlmeVJ6M:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn72@2020_4/2021/07/14/17-34-01-175_b73d9138e1b20b0e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=bBmkzxcvUSk:zqDDlmeVJ6M:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn33@2020_5/2021/07/14/17-34-02-301_0fdf8f196171dee2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn85@2020_2/2021/07/14/17-34-02-502_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=bBmkzxcvUSk:zqDDlmeVJ6M:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn25@2020_4/2021/07/14/17-34-04-522_e845d6a18d79e900.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/bBmkzxcvUSk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn9@2020_5/2021/07/14/17-34-02-187_ea63afa7bec47270.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1626284019898},{"createdTime":"2021-07-15 01:33:39","updatedTime":"2021-07-15 01:33:39","title":"Cathie Wood's Ark Invest abandons Chinese tech stocks amid regulatory crackdown","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/cathie-wood-ark-invest-chinese-stocks-regulatory-crackdown-didi-bytedance-2021-7","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f36baabe89ebf001f044a3d?format=jpeg\" alt=\"NYSE trader\" height=\"2280\" width=\"4560\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Drew Angerer/Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul><li><strong>Cathie Wood&#39;s Ark Invest has rapidly sold its exposure to Chinese technology stocks over the past week.</strong></li><li><strong>The move comes amid a regulatory crackdown on Chinese tech giants like Didi, Alibaba, and ByteDance.</strong></li><li><strong>&#34;I do think there&#39;s a valuation reset,&#34;

They also discussed victories and pivotal moments in their careers:</p><ul><li>&#34;I&#39;m fully aware that when you ask the random person, &#39;What comes to mind when you think of an investment manager?&#39; I&#39;m pretty sure that the image that comes to mind doesn&#39;t look like me,&#34; said Tina Byles Williams, the founder, CEO and CIO of Philadelphia-based asset manager Xponance. &#34;It probably doesn&#39;t look like a woman, and it surely doesn&#39;t look like a Black woman. That is the opportunity and the burden.&#34; </li><li>&#34;I unapologetically take up space,&#34; said Dominique Cherry, head of capital markets at the Philadelphia Board of Pensions and Retirement. &#34;You just make a decision that you&#39;re going to take up as much space as needed until that point that your presence is recognized, your voice is heard, and hopefully you can bring a couple of young people along the way with you.&#34;

mass greenhouse gasses that would leak into the atmosphere. </strong></li>\n<li>Scientists say we need to stop the planet from rising in temperature by just 1° Celsius, or this could happen sooner than we think.</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">Visit Business Insider&#39;s homepage for more stories.</a></strong></p>\n</li>\n</ul><p><em>Following is a transcript of the video.</em></p><p><strong>Narrator: </strong>Ninety-nine percent of all freshwater ice on Earth is sitting on top of Greenland and Antarctica, and each year, a little more of it melts into the ocean. Normally, it would take hundreds to thousands of years for it all to melt away. But what if something happened that caused a massive global melt overnight?</p><p>As we slept, sea levels would rise by a whopping 66 meters. Coastal cities like New York, Shanghai, and London would drown in the apocalyptic mass flood, forcing up to 40% of the world&#39;s population out of their homes. While all this chaos ensues aboveground, something equally sinister is happening below. All that rising saltwater will infiltrate groundwater reserves farther inland, forcing its way into nearby freshwater aquifers. You know, the ones that supply our drinking water, irrigation systems, and power-plant cooling systems? All those aquifers would be destroyed. Not good.</p><p>On top of that, the ice on Greenland and Antarctica is made of freshwater, so when it melts, that&#39;s about 69% of the world&#39;s freshwater supply that&#39;s going straight into the oceans. This will wreak havoc on our ocean currents and weather patterns. Take the Gulf Stream, for example. It&#39;s a strong ocean current that brings warm air to northern Europe and relies on dense, salty water from the Arctic in order to function. But a flood of freshwater would dilute the current and could weaken or even stop it altogether. Without that warm air, temperatures in northern Europe would plummet, and that could spawn a mini ice age, according to some experts.</p><p>That&#39;s not even the worst of it. Take a look at what will happen when that last 1% of freshwater ice that&#39;s not part of Greenland or Antarctica thaws. Some of that 1% is sitting in glaciers farther inland. The Himalayan glaciers specifically pose one of the largest threats because of what&#39;s trapped inside: toxic chemicals like dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, or DDT. Scientists discovered that glaciers like this can store these chemicals for decades. But as they thaw, those glaciers release the chemicals into rivers, lakes, and groundwater reserves, poisoning each one as they go.</p><p>The rest of that 1% is hanging out underground, mostly in the Arctic tundra, as something called permafrost. Permafrost is organic matter that&#39;s been frozen in the ground for two-plus years. Now, one of the most immediate problems with thawing permafrost would be mercury poisoning. That&#39;s right: There are an estimated 15 million gallons of mercury stored up in the Arctic permafrost. That&#39;s almost equal to the amount of mercury everywhere else on Earth. On top of that, the organic matter in permafrost is a tasty meal for microorganisms. After they digest it all, they fart out two of the most potent greenhouse gases out there, carbon dioxide and methane. Scientists estimate this could double the current levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and potentially cause global temperatures to rise by 3.5 degrees Celsius compared to today.</p><p>That might not sound like much, but say goodbye to that mini European ice age, and even rivers and lakes around the world. They&#39;d evaporate from the higher temperatures and cause mass droughts and desert-like climates. And all that extra water vapor in the atmosphere would fuel more frequent and stronger storms, floods, and hurricanes. So all of that newly established coastline on the eastern US would be one of the last places you&#39;d want to live. Instead, there would be mass migrations to Canada, Alaska, the Arctic, and even what&#39;s left of the Antarctic.</p><p>And you&#39;re right, this is probably never going to happen. After all, there&#39;s enough ice right now to cover the entire continent of North America in a sheet a mile thick. So the next time you hear about record-breaking heat or ultra-powerful hurricanes, at least you know that it could be worse. But scientists estimate that if we don&#39;t take action and global temperatures increase by just 1 degree Celsius, the effects of climate change we already see today will be irreversible.

LEGO said in a statement to Insider.</p><p>Culper Precision had described the product as &#34;one of those childhood dreams coming to life&#34; in a recent Instagram <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CQgpPqor1v6/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link\">post</a>. </p><p>&#34;Our business is taking a firearm of known value and transforming it into a personalized invaluable treasure for a fair price,&#34; the company said in a <a href=\"https://culperprecision.com/\">statement</a> on its website. &#34;People have the right to customize their property to make it look like whatever they want. It is our business to assist firearms owners in making their guns better reflect them as a person and individual, our pieces speak to the owner of the gun as they have selected those options from a seemingly infinite range of possibilities.&#34;</p><p>The company also said it wants the Block19 to represent &#34;the pure enjoyment of the shooting sports.&#34; Culper Precision went on to say covering the gun in <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/lego-has-unveiled-prototype-brick-made-from-recycled-plastic-bottles-2021-6\">LEGOs</a> was an attempt at &#34;making the 2nd amendment too painful to tread on.&#34; The company added that it hopes <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/gun-sales-boom-in-pandemic-millennials-buy-guns-2021-5\">guns</a> can be society&#39;s &#34;great unifier.&#34; </p><p>Gun policy is one of the most polarizing topics in US politics.

Too many children&#39;s lives are cut short by unintentional shootings every year - and in the past year we&#39;ve only seen these tragic instances happen more frequently.&#34; </p><p>So far in 2021, there have been at least 174 unintentional shootings by children, leading to 113 injuries and 70 deaths, according to <a href=\"https://everytownresearch.org/maps/notanaccident/\">data from Everytown</a>. Last year, despite the coronavirus pandemic, the US had <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/2020-more-gun-deaths-than-any-year-over-two-decades-2021-3\">a 20-year-high of gun violence deaths</a>, according to data from the Gun Violence Archive. </p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/company-discontinues-lego-gun-block19-cease-and-desist-from-lego-2021-7'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=z3KfcncgJ_I:IN6Pt5EBwDg:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=z3KfcncgJ_I:IN6Pt5EBwDg:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=z3KfcncgJ_I:IN6Pt5EBwDg:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=z3KfcncgJ_I:IN6Pt5EBwDg:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=z3KfcncgJ_I:IN6Pt5EBwDg:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=z3KfcncgJ_I:IN6Pt5EBwDg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=z3KfcncgJ_I:IN6Pt5EBwDg:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=z3KfcncgJ_I:IN6Pt5EBwDg:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/z3KfcncgJ_I\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 14 Jul 2021 16:11:45 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/60eefd63a8d8c00019b031cc?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"95455f80f5f17240dece0ccbae8edfeb","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn29@2020_2/2021/07/14/17-33-40-110_c73ae3872615e99d.webp","destWidth":1440,"destHeight":1080,"sourceBytes":53524,"destBytes":53524,"author":"sjackson@insider.com (Sarah Jackson)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/60eefd63a8d8c00019b031cc?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn29@2020_2/2021/07/14/17-33-40-110_c73ae3872615e99d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn5@2020_2/2021/07/14/17-34-04-185_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=z3KfcncgJ_I:IN6Pt5EBwDg:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn90@2020_1/2021/07/14/17-34-03-647_2b54d4f707038b7c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=z3KfcncgJ_I:IN6Pt5EBwDg:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn51@2020_6/2021/07/14/17-34-01-179_7265701acecbc683.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn85@2020_2/2021/07/14/17-34-02-502_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=z3KfcncgJ_I:IN6Pt5EBwDg:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn42@2020_5/2021/07/14/17-34-02-398_e1efcb0e9a7fa727.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/z3KfcncgJ_I":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn81@2020_2/2021/07/14/17-34-03-949_fc400d5d31bb16f4.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1626284019904},{"createdTime":"2021-07-15 01:33:39","updatedTime":"2021-07-15 01:33:39","title":"How to watch 'Loki,' Marvel's time-hopping series starring Tom Hiddleston - the season finale is now streaming on Disney Plus","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-watch-loki","description":"<p class=\"financial-disclaimer\"><i>When you buy through our links, Insider may earn an affiliate commission. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/insider-reviews-expertise-in-product-reviews\">Learn more.</a></i></p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/609bd21dba78eb001906ed74?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Loki Disney Plus\" height=\"1608\" width=\"3216\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>&#34;Loki&#34;

It's the most populous city in Virginia, made up of numerous inland and coastal communities, with the Virginia Beach Oceanfront being the main resort area.</p><p>Studded with marine-themed statues, including the towering bronze figure of Neptune, the 28-foot-wide paved boardwalk draws tourists and locals alike, who come to stroll, bike, roller-blade, and catch live music and festivals at its many seaside stages.&#160;</p><h2>Where are the best places to stay in a Virginia Beach Airbnb?</h2><p>If you want to be in the middle of the action, opt for the Oceanfront, which stretches from 2nd Street to 40th Street and is packed with hotels, restaurants, bars, and entertainment venues on and around the Boardwalk. Most vacation rentals here are condos and the party atmosphere appeals to a younger crowd.&#160;</p><p>If you want a larger house with amenities and a calmer beach experience, look for Airbnbs in Virginia Beach on the northern end, starting in the mid-30s and going up to 90th Street. The farther north you go, the quieter and more residential it gets.</p><p>During the high summer season, trolleys run frequently from the southern end of the Oceanfront to Shore Drive (roughly 83rd Street), so you can easily get to all the nightlife hotspots.&#160;</p><p>Other desirable oceanfront communities for Airbnbs in Virginia Beach include Croatan and Sandbridge to the south, and to the far north, the tranquil Chesapeake Bay beaches of Chick's Beach offer a truly locals-only experience.</p><h2>What is there to do in Virginia Beach?</h2><p>By far the most popular attraction is the 3-mile-long Virginia Beach Boardwalk, whose wide, paved beachfront path is ideal for strolling, biking, or rollerblading.</p><p>Try your hand at high-octane water sports, including surfing, wakeboarding, parasailing, and jet-skiing, or more relaxing activities like kayaking, stand-up paddleboarding, and fishing.</p><p>State parks offer hiking and biking trails and fantastic bird-watching opportunities. For kids, there's the Virginia Aquarium &#38; Marine Science Center, the Ocean Breeze Waterpark, and several other amusement parks. There's also great dining, with a focus on local seafood, and more than 20 craft breweries and taphouses.</p><h2>How much does it cost to rent a beach house in Virginia Beach?</h2><p>There's a big variety in terms of price, location, size, and amenities. As expected, rentals on or near the beach and close to the buzzy Oceanfront are generally more expensive.</p><p>You can often find better deals on properties along the quieter Chesapeake Bay beaches. &#160; Prices fluctuate wildly depending on the time of year; summer (from Memorial Day through Labor Day) is peak season so expect a surge in prices, especially on weekends and holidays. Shoulder season sees lower rates; September and October, when temps are usually still warm but crowds are fewer, are great months to visit.&#160;</p><p>A two-bedroom bungalow in walking distance to the beach can run as little as $80 per night in October, while that same property in July is $199 per night. Larger properties see bigger price surges, like a five-bedroom oceanside home that can be had for just $250 per night in the off-season, but the summer rate quintuples to $1,250. Many homes book up fast during the coveted summer season so be sure to plan ahead.&#160;</p><p>Be sure to also budget extra fees for cleaning, service fees, and other additional costs imposed by vacation rentals such as Airbnb.</p><h2>Is Virginia Beach open to visitors?</h2><p>If you are planning to travel to Virginia Beach during COVID-19, know that there are no Virginia Beach travel restrictions currently.</p><p>There is a statewide face-covering requirement in place; you can read more about Virginia's current COVID travel restrictions on the <a href=\"https://www.virginia.gov/coronavirus/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">state government's website</a>.&#160;</p><h2>How do I book a vacation rental in Virginia Beach on Airbnb?</h2><p>You may search for homes on Airbnb and filter results based on location, price, date, the number of bedrooms or bathrooms, amenities, and more.

he told CNBC&#39;s &#34;Squawk Box&#34; after <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/consumer-price-index-inflation-june-2021-7?utm_source=markets&utm_medium=ingestgest\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">consumer prices</a> increased 0.9% in June, far higher than the 0.5% consensus estimate of economists polled by Bloomberg.</p><p>Most Wall Street economists and the Fed have stuck to the <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/inflation-outlook-impact-transitory-10-companies-already-passing-costs-consumers-2021-6\">argument that rising prices will indeed be short-lived</a>. </p><p>While Fink said he expects inflation to be more &#34;systematic&#34; over time, he is worried about the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/delta-variant-is-like-covid-19-on-steroids-expert-says-2021-7\">delta variant</a> of COVID-19 slowing down parts of Asia and further disrupting supply-chain shortages.</p><p>&#34;We are seeing a real disconnect between the countries that have been very vaccinated and moving forward on vaccination, and the countries that have been late in vaccination, but focusing more on isolation,&#34; he said. &#34;Isolation worked before we had a vaccination.&#34;</p><p>That could lead to uneven recovery across the world. But with record amounts of monetary stimulus and cash still waiting to be put to work, the growth trajectory is eventually pointing upward, he said.</p><p>&#34;I believe the trend line is still going to be upward, maybe not as fast, maybe it&#39;s going to be very moderate for the next six months as we digest how the world is able to handle the Delta variant and the speed in which vaccinations occur throughout the world,&#34; he said.</p><p>Fink, who has previously said <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/blackrock-larry-fink-bitcoin-institutional-clients-not-interested-crypto-investors-2021-4\">cryptocurrencies could become a great asset class</a>, said BlackRock is seeing low investor demand for bitcoin.</p><p>&#34;That is just not part of the focus on retirement and long-term investors,&#34; he said about demand for cryptocurrencies. &#34;We see very little in terms of investor demand on those types of things, but quite frankly (many)<strong data-stringify-type=\"bold\"> </strong>may not come to BlackRock for that type of demand.&#34;</p><p>He added BlackRock investors are more focused on building long-term returns over a long period of time, and &#34;we don&#39;t have those conversations.&#34;</p><p><em><strong>Read More: </strong><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/investing-q2-earnings-season-under-owned-stocks-picks-buy-bofa-2021-7\" data-analytics-position=\"1\" data-analytics-module=\"\">BANK OF AMERICA: Buy these 22 stocks set to completely crush earnings expectations as volatility around reports creates a stock-picker&#39;s paradise</a></em></p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/inflation-outlook-transitory-blackrock-larry-fink-not-transitory-bitcoin-demand-2021-7'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=FB6YGCzv4lg:jKn7ChfQU5o:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=FB6YGCzv4lg:jKn7ChfQU5o:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=FB6YGCzv4lg:jKn7ChfQU5o:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=FB6YGCzv4lg:jKn7ChfQU5o:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=FB6YGCzv4lg:jKn7ChfQU5o:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=FB6YGCzv4lg:jKn7ChfQU5o:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=FB6YGCzv4lg:jKn7ChfQU5o:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=FB6YGCzv4lg:jKn7ChfQU5o:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/FB6YGCzv4lg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 14 Jul 2021 14:31:07 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/60eedbac61b8600019f16fa3?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"7a001dbdcab056fb3ba76d983d87f9dc","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn25@2020_1/2021/07/14/17-34-05-264_f73eef9e114c3767.webp","destWidth":926,"destHeight":694,"sourceBytes":42038,"destBytes":42038,"author":"snagarajan@businessinsider.com (Shalini Nagarajan)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/60eedba2a8d8c00019b03106?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn96@2020_3/2021/07/14/17-34-00-924_81251c5f9b28945e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn5@2020_2/2021/07/14/17-34-04-185_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=FB6YGCzv4lg:jKn7ChfQU5o:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn17@2020_5/2021/07/14/17-34-02-618_2329e47d8c81dd0f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=FB6YGCzv4lg:jKn7ChfQU5o:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn1@2020_2/2021/07/14/17-34-03-888_003388ca09d872c2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn85@2020_2/2021/07/14/17-34-02-502_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=FB6YGCzv4lg:jKn7ChfQU5o:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn45@2020_2/2021/07/14/17-34-04-155_8014b585ffba483a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/FB6YGCzv4lg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn62@2020_6/2021/07/14/17-34-01-968_386015431fc0df1b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1626284019901},{"createdTime":"2021-07-15 01:33:39","updatedTime":"2021-07-15 01:33:39","title":"McConnell criticizes Texas Democrats for staging a walkout, saying they've come 'to snap selfies and bask in the limelight'","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/mcconnell-slams-texas-democrats-theyve-come-here-to-snap-selfies-2021-7","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60ef014061b8600019f17076?format=jpeg\" alt=\"mitch mcconnell\" height=\"2010\" width=\"4020\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., does a cable news interview before the start of a two-week recess, at the Capitol in Washington, Wednesday, June 23, 2021.\n<p class=\"copyright\">AP Photo/J.

student-loan payments does get extended past October, it would only be temporary. Lawmakers want to ensure the Education Department has plans for long-term borrower protections.</p><p>On Wednesday, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, and Rep. Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts led 23 of their Democratic colleagues in requesting information from the Education Department on practices that &#34;harm student borrowers.&#34; Specifically, in their <a href=\"https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Letter%20to%20ED%20about%20Wage%20Garnishment%20and%20Treasury%20Offset.pdf\">letter</a> to Education Secretary Miguel Cardona, the lawmakers wanted to know the steps the department is taking to protect borrowers&#39; wages and benefits when payments resume.</p><p>&#34;Even before the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, collections on defaulted student loans were catastrophic for borrowers in default, who saw their wages, tax refunds, and even Social Security checks confiscated, in addition to being forced to pay exorbitant fees,&#34; the Democrats wrote.</p><p>The letter cited a <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/education-postsecondary/reports/2017/12/14/444011/student-loan-defaulters/\">report</a> from the Center for American Progress that found 45% of borrowers in default have not found a path to return their loan to good credit standing, which makes housing and job opportunities more difficult to land.</p><p>Democrats added that although the CARES Act initially paused student-loan payments during the pandemic, the Education Department and Treasury Department still &#34;improperly garnished and withheld&#34; over $200 million from about 390,000 borrowers during this time.</p><p>&#34;The Department&#39;s failure to fully implement the collections moratorium raises concerns about how it will handle the upcoming scheduled resumption of collections and payments on October 1, 2021,&#34; the letter said.</p><p>The Education Department also said it would refund any wage or tax refunds collected after the pandemic began, but over 23,000 borrowers who had their wages garnished have yet to receive refunds because the department didn&#39;t have borrowers&#39; correct addresses on file, <a href=\"https://www.studentloanborrowerassistance.org/lawsuit-against-devos-ends-fight-for-defaulted-borrowers-continues/\">according to</a> the National Consumer Law Center, which is why the Democrats are stressing the importance of proper preparation to transition into student-loan repayment.</p><p>Many Democrats who have signed this letter are also calling for the payment pause to be <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/student-loan-debt-payment-pause-extensionelizabeth-warren-chuck-schumer-2021-6\">extended</a> through at least March of next year, given that both borrowers and services have said they are <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/student-loan-companies-debt-payment-pause-extension-elizabeth-warren-2021-7\">not prepared</a> to resume payments in just a few months. </p><p>The lawmakers wrote: &#34;As we near the currently scheduled end of the suspension of payments and collections, we are concerned about plunging borrowers back into an untenable financial situation, causing long-term damage to their credit and financial stability and a sudden unnecessary drag on our recovering economy.&#34;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original

Once it gets out of the tube, it&#39;s going to be very hard to put back in.&#34; - <em>quoting Dr. Karl Otto Pohl, the former president of Germany&#39;s Bundesbank, who Gabelli met in the early 1990s.</em></p><p>2. &#34;I find it offensive that somebody can do this on social media.&#34; - <em>criticizing stock promoters and pump-and-dump schemes on Twitter</em>.</p><p>3. &#34;If you drink it - wine, water, beer, soda, whatever - we follow. Anything you watch, anywhere in the world, on any device, and any content or distribution, we cover it. We cluster up our knowledge and try to figure out, &#39;Does this make sense?&#39;&#34; - <em>emphasizing the scale of GAMCO&#39;s industry research.</em></p><p>4. &#34;They think I&#39;m always mad. Let&#39;s stipulate that as a constant.&#34; -<em> commenting on Wall Street&#39;s reaction when he began investing overseas in 1989.</em></p><p>5. &#34;Knock on their door. You can&#39;t do that on a Zoom call. You want to ask a lot of questions. You want to understand how quick the answers are. You want to know how thoughtful they are in terms of handling dynamics of change and handling the simple things. &#39;You&#39;ve got a parts shortage. What are you doing about it? You&#39;ve got a labor shortage. What are you doing about hedging the currency?&#39;&#34; - <em>encouraging investors to speak to companies&#39; management</em>.</p><p>6. &#34;Think of me as a relic of the past, but one that will do quite well over the next 20 years. My window is narrowing but I still have some runway.&#34; - <em>defending his ability to keep performing at age 79</em>.</p><p>7. &#34;The great future is in batteries. When you think about investing over the next 10 to 20 years, we need renewable energy, we need wind, solar, alternative energy, batteries, cybersecurity, and transmission, but the batteries are an important element. The electric vehicles of the world need to have a fast-charging battery with longer mileage as well.&#34;</p><p>8. &#34;I wear hair shirts all my life.&#34; - <em>recalling the opportunities he&#39;s missed including Netflix, which rose 20-fold in value after he decided it was too expensive to buy.</em></p><p>9. &#34;The only time I bought Berkshire Hathaway was in 1985 and we still own it. It was like $3,000 a share.&#34; - <em>Gabelli Funds held 220 of Berkshire&#39;s &#34;A&#34; shares worth $85 million at the end of March.</em></p><p>10. &#34;It would have been nice to sit back and not do any work, retire, go fishing, watch football, and just own Berkshire Hathaway stock. Every so often, if I needed some cash flow, I would take a 1/1500th of a share and sell it. But we would probably get bored, and during certain periods of time, like 1999, the stock did not do well and our clients would have all fired us if that&#39;s all we owned.&#34;</p><p>11. &#34;There&#39;s nothing wrong with being a bargain hunter. We check the price of everything we buy. Even if we go to Costco, my wife checks the price somewhere else.&#34;</p><p>12. &#34;A lot of the SPACs have been dressed up for the stock market, and there have been a lot of less-than-optimal results.&#34; - <em>Gabelli pointed to Nikola Motors as an example</em>.</p><p>13. &#34;Work from five to nine, your competitors are going to work from nine to five. Drink one less beer, one less coffee at an expensive coffee shop, and save the money each week. Then compound it at 2%, 4%, 6%, 8%, 10% over the next 40 years, and see what that gives you - economic flexibility.&#34; - <em>Gabelli&#39;s advice to young people.</em></p><p>14. &#34;You don&#39;t want to have wealth to have wealth. You want to have options, so that you can tell somebody what to do, as opposed to having someone tell you what to do. In addition to that, be passionate about what you do, because if you just want a job, you&#39;re not going to be happy.&#34;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/mario-gabelli-gamco-stock-promoters-batteries-warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-2021-7'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=ukxNwzz9fAw:RcK-cO1H7R4:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=ukxNwzz9fAw:RcK-cO1H7R4:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=ukxNwzz9fAw:RcK-cO1H7R4:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=ukxNwzz9fAw:RcK-cO1H7R4:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=ukxNwzz9fAw:RcK-cO1H7R4:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=ukxNwzz9fAw:RcK-cO1H7R4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=ukxNwzz9fAw:RcK-cO1H7R4:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=ukxNwzz9fAw:RcK-cO1H7R4:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/ukxNwzz9fAw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 14 Jul 2021 13:55:37 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/60eed7d861b8600019f16f9c?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"c2ac8c68ffee44a0410cdae1ddcee3aa","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn64@2020_1/2021/07/14/17-34-00-932_68fe05557755d20f.webp","destWidth":761,"destHeight":570,"sourceBytes":16350,"destBytes":16350,"author":"tmohamed@businessinsider.com (Theron Mohamed)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/60eed7c261b8600019f16f9b?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn18@2020_3/2021/07/14/17-34-02-410_7066b6372ff8050f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn5@2020_2/2021/07/14/17-34-04-185_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=ukxNwzz9fAw:RcK-cO1H7R4:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn96@2020_5/2021/07/14/17-34-01-260_334c88963f7b926d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=ukxNwzz9fAw:RcK-cO1H7R4:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn30@2020_1/2021/07/14/17-34-03-416_f889ae5be61dab64.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn85@2020_2/2021/07/14/17-34-02-502_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=ukxNwzz9fAw:RcK-cO1H7R4:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn97@2020_4/2021/07/14/17-34-04-406_72c56467b29752d9.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/ukxNwzz9fAw":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn69@2020_3/2021/07/14/17-34-04-364_dbf5e584bde147ec.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1626284019905},{"createdTime":"2021-07-15 01:33:39","updatedTime":"2021-07-15 01:33:39","title":"As a teacher, the Republican Florida law requiring students and staff to expose their political beliefs is a gross government overreach","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/florida-school-law-sb-233-government-hypocritical-republicans-de-santis-2021-7","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60edfe1fa8d8c00019b02ff2?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Ron DeSantis\" height=\"1000\" width=\"2000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Florida Gov.

Recently, the Republican Florida Legislature passed <a href=\"https://www.myfloridahouse.gov/Sections/Documents/loaddoc.aspx?FileName=_h0233er.docx&DocumentType=Bill&BillNumber=0233&Session=2021Session=2021\">SB 233</a>, which mandates the State Board of Education to conduct an annual survey of the &#34;intellectual freedom and viewpoint diversity&#34; on each campus. Once it was passed by the Legislature, it was signed into law by Republican Governor Ron DeSantis.</p><p>This bill will survey the staff and students at public universities about their political beliefs. The bill and the resulting surveys are dangerous and an overreach of the government. We should not compel universities to ask their employees or students about their political beliefs. This is big government and an intrusion into the rights of people.</p><h2>Survey says</h2><p>This bill stands in stark contrast to the <a href=\"https://www.gop.com/platform/renewing-american-values/\">Republican Platform</a>, in which they &#34;call on state officials to preserve our public colleges, universities, and trade schools as places of learning and the exchange of ideas, not zones of intellectual intolerance or &#39;safe zones,&#39; as if college students need protection from the free exchange of ideas.&#34;</p><p>SB 233 will intrude in the lives of students and staff on college campuses by asking them to fill out a survey about their beliefs. Proponents say that this is needed to make sure that there is an adequate representation of political views on campus. By their admission then, they are attempting to &#34;protect&#34; college students from varying views, a stark contradiction of the GOP platform.  </p><p>This bill was a solution for a problem that does not exist. In 2018 in Florida, the <a href=\"https://www.flsenate.gov/laws/statutes/2018/1004.097\">Campus Free Expression Act</a> went into effect to protect free expression in the public areas of the campuses. </p><p>One aspect of the bill could be to &#34;level&#34; the ideological makeup of campus faculty.t At face value, that sounds great. However, it&#39;s more dangerous than you think. Imagine a QAnon believer examining the survey results and stating that there is not enough representation on the faculty that supports these views and demanding that the university hire a QAnon faculty member, or even people calling for the addition of a Holocaust denier to the staff to satisfy someone&#39;s interpretation of a survey. This law has the potential to weaponize campus and turn them into cesspools of conspiracy theorists. </p><p>The security of the survey responses is another factor that has to be considered. With computer hacking happening at <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/05/business/leon-panetta-cyber-attacks.html\">unprecedented levels</a>, there is no guarantee that these survey results will remain anonymous. Foreign actors such as Russian, China, and Iran have made it a goal to sow hateful discourse in America and promote political chaos, especially in the 2016 presidential election. </p><p>Allan Liska, an intelligence analyst at Recorded Future <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/03/us/politics/ransomware-cybersecurity-infrastructure.html\">said</a> when discussing government cyber security, that &#34;&#34;Ransomware attacks are only going to get worse and more pervasive into people&#39;s lives, and they&#39;re not disappearing anytime soon.&#34;  It would be easy for a hostile country to hack these surveys and leak the results and responses in a way that would promote discord and division.   </p><p>Additionally, the law allows further intrusion into the educational environment in which it  guarantees the right to record classroom lectures and discussions. As a teacher, I can tell you that this is a recipe for disaster. </p><p>Recording someone without permission (or a warrant) a <a href=\"http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&Search_String=&URL=0900-0999/0934/Sections/0934.03.html.03.html\">felony</a> under Florida law, as Florida is a &#34;Two Party&#34; state where it is a crime to intercept or record a &#34;wire, oral, or electronic communication&#34;, unless all parties to the communication consent, something that many of my fellow educators would not allow. </p><p>Giving students universal control and the right to record teachers without their knowledge is a travesty. Imagine if a student who was angry over a recent grade recorded a teacher and baited them to say something out of context  and then posted the video on social media and ruined the teacher&#39;s reputation. In an era where Republican are fighting against &#34;cancel culture&#34; , recording teachers for their academic views for the intent of having them replaced would degrade an educational system that is the best in the world.</p><p>Republicans, especially Tea Party Republicans, for years have fought against government intrusion into people&#39;s lives, as many fought and <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/other/conservative-voices-against-usa-patriot-act\">spoke out</a> against the Patriot Act. SB 233 not only allows universal surveillance into classrooms, but also pries into the political beliefs of students and faculty. </p><p>Colleges and universities should and must be a free expression of ideas and intellectual discovery. There is no need for the state to pry into the beliefs of students and staff by surveying their thoughts, something that you would see in more authoritative countries. We must promote educational environments that are meant to challenge students&#39; thoughts and not make professors feel as if big brother is watching at all times.</p><div

We had a two-hour cocktail reception, then got back on the cruise.</p><p>I decided to use a travel agent because I didn&#39;t want all the guests calling me, but this travel agent was with a bigger agency and the experience was awful. I almost felt like I was telling her how to do her job.</p><p>She wasn&#39;t very flexible and I swore off using an agent. Then, I ended up joining a cruise community on Facebook, which is a huge thing because cruising is so social, and I had to book through their travel agent to go on our group cruise.</p><p>The agent and I ended up talking - and we&#39;re now best friends four years later. We even host a weekly travel talk show together going over travel news for our little travel community that we created on Facebook this year. Working with him was just a totally different experience.</p><p>When I was doing a trip this past August, my plane ended up being rerouted because of a windstorm, so we ended up landing at an airport and had to clear customs there and wait for the plane to fuel up.</p><p>It was 8 p.m. on Saturday, and I called him and he told me what I could purchase and have covered through my travel insurance. He had me send him all my receipts, submitted it all to the travel insurance company, and got me refunds for my hotel, meals, and flight.</p><p>Travel agents don&#39;t cost money - they make their commissions from the ships and travel insurance agencies or tour companies. They also get access to a completely different set of rates than Expedia or what you see online.</p><p>If somebody&#39;s preparing to go on a cruise during the pandemic, using a travel agent is huge even if you&#39;re a seasoned cruiser because the guidelines keep changing, and it&#39;s their job to stay on top of it.</p><h2><strong>Travel insurance is also great because it covers anything from medical issues to trip interruption or even theft.</strong></h2><p>I&#39;d never had travel insurance until my travel agent educated me on it, but it&#39;s been helpful already. I had my phone stolen in Paris last year and my travel insurance covered it.</p><p>Some people I know kind of don&#39;t want to spend the money, but for my husband, my daughter, and I for our two cruises at the end of August it cost $225 total. So worth it.</p><p>It&#39;s not necessarily the medical aspect that gets used the majority of the time - it&#39;s trip interruption, the hiccups, and things of that nature.</p><h2><strong>I also recommend doing your research.</strong></h2><p>Watch a cruise-ship tour video and stateroom tour videos. There are websites like <a href=\"https://www.cruisecritic.com/\">Cruise Critic</a>, where people rate certain room types. You could, for example, see if anybody has stayed in Adventure of the Sea room 9244 and see the reviews on that.</p><p>My husband&#39;s a bigger guy, and the stateroom showers are kind of like tubes, so if you&#39;re a big and tall guy you might need to research what room you&#39;re booking to know what&#39;s best for you and what will be comfortable.</p><p>What people don&#39;t realize is, online they&#39;re going to have pictures of their newest and greatest ships, and not all the pictures online are completely accurate to what your room is going to look like. If you&#39;re seeing videos and pictures of Symphony of the Seas and you go and book the Brilliance of the Seas, you&#39;re frankly going to be a little disappointed.</p><p>I&#39;ve had cruise regret on certain ship types that I&#39;ve booked because it was cheap. And there are certain classes of ships that are not for me.</p><h2><strong>Join Facebook groups to meet people ahead of your cruise.</strong></h2><p>I&#39;ve met so many new people because of cruises. Facebook, as much as it&#39;s an older social-media platform, is a great hub for the cruise experience.</p><p>There are a lot of groups to choose from, too - for example, there will be a group called Adventure of the Sea June 12 that you can join and ask questions and meet with people going on the same cruise ahead of time.</p><p>You can also go to Instagram and search hashtags for your different cruises and you&#39;ll see content creators and bloggers that cruise and even other cruise-goers you can connect with. You&#39;ll also find people such as myself doing lives every week and answering questions.</p><h2><strong>There are things you can bring to make your room - which is typically much smaller than a hotel room - more comfortable.</strong></h2><p>For example, I bring magnetic hooks because your walls are metal to hang my bathrobe or different things from them. I also bring a pop-up hamper for laundry. Little cruise-packing hacks.</p><p>Another thing people don&#39;t realize is you have very limited outlets, so I have a multiport charging outlet.</p><h2><strong>Before my first post-pandemic cruise, I wish we had a little more information about what the onboard experience was going to be like.</strong></h2><p>I don&#39;t think I was emotionally prepared enough for how different the environment would be with the mass reduction of people onboard and how the COVID-19 protocols altered the social experience.</p><p>Another thing people need to be aware of is it&#39;s not just knowing what your cruise line protocols are - you need to keep up with your port-of-call protocols. My friend is on a cruise right now, and Barbados required masks the whole way through.</p><p>You need to be flexible, and you need to make a conscious decision about purchasing from a line that aligns with your values and wants.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/what-to-know-advice-plan-cruise-2021-7'>Business Insider</a></div><div

\n</ul>\n<p>Despite claims by some Republican politicians led by former President Trump that social media sites censor conservative views, Facebook's data makes it clear: The social network's best

caused Facebook executives to bristle at what the tool shows to the public.</p>\n<p>\"Our own tools are helping journos to consolidate the wrong narrative,\" Facebook VP of global affairs Nick Clegg said in an internal company email, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/14/technology/inside-facebooks-data-wars.html\">according to a new report by The New York Times</a>. Like Facebook's advertising transparency tools, Crowdtangle has been repeatedly used to demonstrate major criticisms of the tech and social media giant - criticisms that Facebook execs would rather not have to defend in public.</p>\n<p>Perhaps most prominent is a Twitter tool created by New York Times tech writer Kevin Roose automatically pulls data from Crowdtangle every day that shows, \"the top-performing link posts by US Facebook pages in the last 24 hours, ranked by total interactions.\"</p>\n<p>To break that down: Posts containing links to something outside of Facebook that were shared within the last 24 hours by a US-based Facebook page. And the list is ranked from 1 to 10 depending on total \"interactions\" - which includes \"reactions, shares, and comments,\" according to Roose.</p>\n<p>As the data shows, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FacebooksTop10\">the most-engaged pages top 10 list</a> is consistently dominated by the likes of Fox News host Sean Hannity, conservative commentator Ben Shapiro, and Christian evangelist Franklin Graham.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet blockquote\" data-lang=\"en\" data-cards=\"\" data-conversation=\"\">\n -Facebook's Top 10 (@FacebooksTop10) \n <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mims/statuses/1414993359551156224?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 13, 2021</a>\n</blockquote>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p>Before he was banned from Facebook following the January 6 attempted insurrection, Trump's pages dominated the lists.</p>\n<p>That, among other metrics, is what led to <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-mark-zuckerberg-dinner-number-one-facebook-2020-1\">Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg telling Trump he was \"number one\"</a> on the social media platform in late 2019.</p>\n<p>Internally, Facebook execs are reportedly divided over what to do with Crowdtangle and its data. Some Facebook execs are said to have argued for more data transparency, but others are said to have argued against the potential for more negative stories about Facebook to emerge. </p>\n<p>\"Facebook would love full transparency if there was a guarantee of positive stories and outcomes,\" former Facebook VP Brian Boland told the Times. \"But when transparency creates uncomfortable moments, their reaction is often to shut down the transparency.\"</p>\n<p>Part of the reason Boland left Facebook, he says, is because, \"the company does not want to invest in understanding the impact of its core products.\" </p>\n<p>Facebook representatives didn't respond to a request for comment as of publishing, but Facebook spokesperson Joe Osborne told the Times that Crowdtangle, \"is part of a growing suite of transparency resources we've made available for people, including academics and journalists\" and that the company is, \"developing a more comprehensive strategy for how we build on some of these transparency efforts moving forward.\"</p>\n<p><em><strong>Got a tip?</strong> Contact Insider senior correspondent Ben Gilbert via email (<a href=\"mailto:bgilbert@insider.com\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"100\">bgilbert@insider.com</a>),</em><em> or Twitter DM (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/RealBenGilbert\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"100\">@realbengilbert</a>).

After a year of customers complaining about month-long delays, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/peloton-spends-100m-expedited-shipping-2021-2\">Peloton spent $100 million</a> to expedite

href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/shipping-crisis-causing-shortages-why-2021-6\">Insider&#39;s Rachel Premack reported in June.</a></p><p>Schreiber told Bloomberg that while large corporations like Walmart can leverage company connections to place its orders on mega-ships in time, smaller and mid-sized brands get &#34;squeezed out.&#34; </p><p>In order for the world&#39;s shipping system to function, three elements are required: massive ships, containers on the ships, and places for the ships to park so that the containers can be unloaded. </p><p>While the price of shipping containers has <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/shipping-stocks-evergreen-price-transport-rates-container-crisis-supply-chain-2021-6\">skyrocketed</a>, Schreiber said that the industry simply does not have enough massive ships to keep up with America&#39;s outsized demand. </p><p>The only scenario in which Schreiber can foresee shipping timelines returning to pre-pandemic levels is if <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-the-global-shipping-crisis-ends-shortages-2021-6\">people start ordering fewer things.</a></p><p>&#34;It&#39;s hard to predict the future,&#34; Schreiber said. &#34;As restaurants and travel reopen, people may just spend a little less on stuff and that will solve the problem very quickly.&#34; </p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the

stage as the US economy climbs out of its year-long slump. Economists expected the combination of a swift reopening and trillions of dollars in stimulus would lift prices at their fastest rate in recent history, and it soared to its fastest rate since 2008 in the spring. After a brief dip, June&#39;s number came in higher than expected, fueled by big price increases for <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/price-of-used-cars-record-increase-june-2021-7\">used cars</a> and <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/beef-pork-prices-rising-inflation-when-food-costs-could-fall-2021-7\">some food like beef and pork</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/inflation-stimulus-debate-economic-growth-spending-federal-reserve-larry-summers-2021-3\">For some</a>, forecasts of stronger inflation bring up memories of the 1970s and 1980s, an era sometimes called the Great Inflation, when prices grew at such a furious pace that the Federal Reserve had to lift interest rates to historic highs.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/millennials-boomers-inflation-fears-age-gap-stimulus-economic-growth-recovery-2021-3\">For younger observers</a>, healthy inflation is a long pursued but seldom seen goal. Price growth has trended below the Fed&#39;s 2% target for most of the past quarter-century. People under 40 simply don&#39;t know a world with runaway inflation - or what the beginning of such a world might look like.</p><p>But recent economic headlines - gas shortages, troubles in the labor market, and big-government programs - have a distinctly &#39;70s flair. Just when should Americans know when to be really worried that inflation could be back in a big and problematic way?</p><p>Here&#39;s a look at what inflation actually is, why it&#39;s a tricky concept that is a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy, and how it&#39;s actually unfolding in 2021.</p><bi-shortcode id=\"table-of-contents-sticky\" class=\"mceNonEditable\" data-type=\"h2\">Table of Contents: Masthead Sticky</bi-shortcode><h2>Why are people worried about inflation?</h2><p>The basic notion of soaring prices is concerning. Roughly 9.3 million Americans are still out of work, and millions more were unemployed for at least some of the past year. At a time when many Americans are looking for stable financial footing, people are more worried about inflation <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/inflation-expectations-outlook-rise-us-economy-reopening-spending-price-growth-2021-5\">than they have been in years</a>.</p><p>The way in which prices have been climbing has already made some worried. While the Fed and President Joe Biden&#39;s Council of Economic Advisors have repeatedly said they expect stronger inflation to be only temporary, others are less optimistic.</p><p>Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, one of the loudest voices raising concerns of rampant price growth, castigated Democrats&#39; $1.9 trillion stimulus in March as the &#34;least responsible&#34; fiscal policy in 40 years and kindling for an inflation crisis.</p><p>&#34;I think there&#39;s about a one-third chance that the Fed and the Treasury will get what they&#39;re hoping for and we&#39;ll get rapid growth that will moderate in a non-inflationary way,&#34; he added.</p><p>A return to the inflation seen in the 1970s would be disastrous for the already ailing economy. In that decade, swaths of easy money were initially viewed as a way to combat unemployment, but inflation quickly broke out of its trend and spiraled out of control. The Fed was forced to step in with interest rates as high as 20% to choke off the price growth, and that had its own detrimental effects on the economy, including a deep recession in the early 1980s.</p><p>Conservative economists have warned Biden&#39;s $1.9 trillion stimulus package was unnecessary and could spark a similar disaster. Whether price growth stays elevated or trends back to about 2% will tell the tale of whether Biden&#39;s plan was safe or fuel for a 1970s-like crash.</p><h2>What would healthy inflation look like this year?</h2><p>The Fed, America&#39;s central bank, has an &#34;inflation target,&#34; which it uses to guide price growth. In a major shift, the central bank replaced its 2% target in August with a goal for inflation that averages 2% over time. This update allows the Fed to pursue inflation above 2% immediately after the crisis as it tries to run the economy hot and drive a stronger recovery.</p><p>The Fed&#39;s own projections point to the stronger-but-transitory inflation it expects to see over the next few months. Policymakers expect year-over-year personal consumption expenditures - the Fed&#39;s preferred inflation measure - to reach 3% this year before cooling to 2.1% in 2022, according to a <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcprojtabl20210616.pdf\">June release</a>.</p><p>The Fed&#39;s new inflation target opens the door for a period of economic overheating as the country reopens. It&#39;s this gamble that concerns conservative economists, or &#34;hawks.&#34; After decades of not letting inflation trend above 2%, it&#39;s embarking on an experiment to let the country run hot in hopes of a faster recovery.</p><p>Fed Chair Jerome Powell has been less exact with his forecast, but expects inflation to trend above 2% for &#34;some time&#34; before falling in line with the central bank&#39;s long-term goal.</p><h2>How does inflation look now?</h2><p>Signs of an inflation pick-up have emerged, which the Fed says it expected and critics say merits caution.</p><p>The PCE price index <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/pce-inflation-may-price-growth-economic-data-reopening-spending-surge-2021-6\">jumped 0.4% in May</a>, marking a slowdown from price growth seen in March and April. Economists expected a 0.5% jump last month. The measure also notched a 3.9% year-over-year gain, the fastest annual rate since August 2008.</p><p>Still, the comparison is somewhat skewed by last year&#39;s weak readings. Inflation &#34;doves&#34; say such a big jump is only natural after the pandemic and widespread lockdowns brought price growth to a near crawl.</p><p>The core PCE price index, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 0.5% in April and 3.4% on a year-over-year basis. The core measure is the Fed&#39;s preferred gauge of nationwide price growth.</p><p>Separately, the Consumer Price Index <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/consumer-price-index-inflation-june-2021-7\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\">showed prices climbing 0.9% from May to June</a>. The gauge rose 5.4% year-over-year, also indicating the strongest inflation since 2008.</p><p>Inflation expectations are also a gauge worth watching. Median US inflation expectations for the next 12 months gained to 4% in May from 3.4%, according to the <a href=\"https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/news/research/2021/20210614\">Federal Reserve Bank of New York</a>. Expectations can serve as a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy. When Americans anticipate faster price growth, businesses tend to lift prices and workers in turn demand higher wages. While inflation expectations typically surpass real inflation, they can hint at the direction inflation will trend, and even affect prices and wages in that direction.</p><h2>What can the Fed and the government do about inflation?</h2><p>Inflation has been half of the Fed&#39;s dual mandate since its inception in 1913. The central bank was tasked by Congress to ensure stable price growth for the US economy. Its main lever for doing so is its benchmark interest rate, which dictates borrowing costs across the country.</p><p>When rates are high, Americans are more incentivized to save money. When rates are low, or near zero as they are today, Americans are pushed to borrow and spend. The Fed&#39;s ability to change rates allows it to stimulate economic activity in times of recession or cool spending when the economy is running hot.</p><p>The latter is primarily how the Fed dampens strong inflation. By raising interest rates, the central bank weakens the incentive to borrow and spend. That then drags on demand and weakens the rate at which businesses lift prices.</p><p>Powell said in March that lifting its threshold for future rate hikes can allow it to <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/fed-powell-march-fomc-asset-purchases-central-bank-monetary-policy-2021-3\">more aggressively pursue its maximum-employment target</a>.</p><section data-track-content=\"\" data-post-type=\"post\"><p>&#34;There was a time when there was a tight connection between unemployment and inflation. That time is long gone,&#34; he said. &#34;We had low unemployment in 2018 and 2019 and the beginning of &#39;20 without having troubling inflation at all.&#34;</p><p>During those years, unemployment and wage growth among low-income households and racial minorities started to fall in line with broader measures.

The report points to a possible reason why: half of respondents said they&#39;re worried items will be out of stock.</p><p>Plus, experts say parents&#39; spending will be boosted by higher-than-normal savings and the new child tax credit starting this week from the federal government.</p><h2>The new child tax credits could help parents foot the bill </h2><p>Many parents will start receiving monthly <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/irs-child-tax-credit-payment-dates-families-monthly-payments-2021-6\">child tax credit payments </a>of $250 or $300 per child this week through December.

Fresh EBT, an app to track food stamp balances, found users also plan to spend some of the payments on back-to-school items, as reported by <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/12/us/politics/child-tax-credit-payments.html\">The New York Times</a>. </p><h2>People also stashed away savings over the last year</h2><p>According to Deloitte&#39;s back-to-school surveys, spending for both college and K-12 will be larger this year. Deloitte projects back-to-school spending for K-12 to increase by roughly 16% from the year before to $32.5 billion. Even as some students return to in-person learning, Deloitte found spending on tech will be 37% higher than in 2020. A survey from <a href=\"https://advisory.kpmg.us/articles/2021/consumer-pulse-survey-back-to-school-2021.html\">KPMG</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mastercard.com/news/press/2021/june/back-to-school-u-s-retail-sales-expected-to-grow-5-5-compared-to-last-year-according-to-mastercard-spendingpulse/\">Mastercard</a> also shows spending will be much higher this year than last year.</p><p>Rod Sides, vice chairman of Deloitte and Deloitte&#39;s US retail, wholesale, and distribution leader, told Insider he thinks one of the reasons consumers will be shopping earlier is because they want their kids to begin the school year with the items they need. </p><p>&#34;And there&#39;s more money available for that,&#34; Sides said. &#34;Generally when you&#39;ve got reasonably low unemployment and a high savings rate that usually translates to a much higher spending season.&#34;</p><p>The personal savings rate in May 2021 was <a href=\"https://www.bea.gov/news/2021/personal-income-and-outlays-may-2021\">12.4%</a>, higher than pre-pandemic rates. Personal savings totaled to <a href=\"https://www.bea.gov/news/2021/personal-income-and-outlays-may-2021\">$2.29 trillion</a> in May. The unemployment rate has fallen from pandemic highs and now stands at 5.9%, still higher than the pre-pandemic rate of 3.5%.</p><p>Additionally, a recent <a

expensive.</p><p>&#34;According to KPMG economic analysis, many products are seeing a spike in prices, driven by the combination of supply shocks to US manufacturing suppliers and strong demand for

Resellers are charging far more than retail price on eBay and Amazon and even older cards are selling for above market rate. Given the current market situation it may be more affordable to shop for a pre-built gaming PC or laptop, rather than buying a graphics card separately and building your own.<br><br>Prices for the same cards can vary between manufacturers, with upgrades like extra cooling fans or RGB lighting increasing the cost. Graphics cards shipped were also impacted by a US tariff increase that arrived in early 2021, leading manufacturers to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22228470/nvidia-evga-zotac-raise-prices-rtx-3080-3070-3060-3090\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">increase their prices by $70 to $300</a> more than what RTX 30 series and AMD 6000 series cards originally sold for in fall 2020.</p><h2>What to know before buying a graphics card</h2><p>The graphics card might be the most important part of building a gaming PC, as it will likely determine your computer&#39;s peak performance. However, the more you spend on a graphics card, the more you&#39;ll need to spend on other parts to make sure you&#39;re not limiting its potential.</p><p>Even a $1,500 graphics card like the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fgraphics-cards%2F30-series%2Frtx-3090%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">RTX 3090</a> can struggle if paired with an old processor or motherboard, so be sure to make sure the components in your PC are all modern and compatible before spending most of your budget on a graphics card. </p><p>Specifically, you should make sure your power supply can deliver requirements for your card of choice, and you should see if your motherboard supports PCI 4.0. A weak CPU can create a bottleneck that limits the overall speed of your gaming computer too, so don&#39;t overspend on your graphics card if you can&#39;t upgrade your CPU to a similar quality.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/where-to-buy-graphics-card-nvidia-amd'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=9h2mTZ3_Iw8:43-KqUoNSEc:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=9h2mTZ3_Iw8:43-KqUoNSEc:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=9h2mTZ3_Iw8:43-KqUoNSEc:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=9h2mTZ3_Iw8:43-KqUoNSEc:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=9h2mTZ3_Iw8:43-KqUoNSEc:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=9h2mTZ3_Iw8:43-KqUoNSEc:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=9h2mTZ3_Iw8:43-KqUoNSEc:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=9h2mTZ3_Iw8:43-KqUoNSEc:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/9h2mTZ3_Iw8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 14 Jul 2021 15:57:10 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5f512099e6ff30001d4e6e64?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"94fdb0fdf3d533054a5f9222098a0ba3","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn15@2020_6/2021/07/14/17-33-43-111_67a20d1c4996f6d9.webp","destWidth":837,"destHeight":627,"sourceBytes":26436,"destBytes":26436,"author":"kwebb@businessinsider.com (Kevin Webb)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5f512099e6ff30001d4e6e64?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn15@2020_6/2021/07/14/17-33-43-111_67a20d1c4996f6d9.webp","https://i.insider.com/60dc87d6a08b100012b4177f?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn62@2020_1/2021/07/14/17-34-02-738_c46cc3057e5e05b7.webp","https://i.insider.com/60dc8959cad1220011caf338?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn10@2020_2/2021/07/14/17-34-03-680_0c91674c38352ae2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn5@2020_2/2021/07/14/17-34-04-185_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=9h2mTZ3_Iw8:43-KqUoNSEc:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn1@2020_6/2021/07/14/17-34-04-390_a402f4a997583fc6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=9h2mTZ3_Iw8:43-KqUoNSEc:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn75@2020_5/2021/07/14/17-34-01-421_8ed3036032b76aa1.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn85@2020_2/2021/07/14/17-34-02-502_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=9h2mTZ3_Iw8:43-KqUoNSEc:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn41@2020_6/2021/07/14/17-34-03-460_f496d70b39fc2f95.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/9h2mTZ3_Iw8":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn49@2020_4/2021/07/14/17-34-02-087_9d64b2105fe94186.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1626284019895},{"createdTime":"2021-07-15 01:33:39","updatedTime":"2021-07-15 01:33:39","title":"Donald Trump Jr. says destruction of George Floyd mural might be a sign from God","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/don-trump-jr-george-floyd-mural-instagram-sign-from-god-2021-7","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60eee57ca8d8c00019b03123?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Donald Trump Jr. gestures toward the ceiling during a CPAC speech in Dallas, Texas.\" height=\"1244\" width=\"2488\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Donald Trump Jr.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Eva Marie Uzcategui/Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>Donald Trump Jr. thinks a destroyed George Floyd mural in Ohio might be a sign from God.</li>\n<li>&#34;I mean you have to wonder if ... a higher power, is telling us something here?!?&#34;

on European stocks as the place to realize chunky gains in the coming year, as the red-hot rally in US equities cools.</p><p>Morgan Stanley, BlackRock, Nuveen and JPMorgan Asset Management are just some of the financial firms that have said Europe is the place to be for investors, given the economic recovery is picking up pace and the continent has more &#34;cyclical&#34; firms that stand to benefit from the rebound.</p><p>BlackRock has said it is now &#34;overweight&#34; on European stocks and &#34;neutral&#34; on the US, along with a number of other firms such as Morgan Stanley. And Tuesday&#39;s Bank of America survey found that fund managers increased their allocation to eurozone stocks in June, with more investors keen on the region than at any time since January 2018.</p><p><em><strong>Read more: </strong><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/global-recovery-bets-top-themes-nuveen-stock-chief-saira-malik-2021-6\">Saira Malik manages $420 billion as the stock-investment chief for asset manager Nuveen, and her 3 strategies have all beaten the market over the past year. She told us 4 top themes traders could use to capitalize on the broadening global recovery.</a></em></p><p><strong>Strategists are cooling on US stocks after a breakneck rally</strong></p><p>The <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/index/s&p_500_500\">S&#38;P 500</a> has rocketed around 90% from its March 2020 lows, as huge amounts of monetary and fiscal stimulus, as well as increased interest from retail traders, have driven up stocks.</p><p>Many on Wall Street think the index has probably logged the bulk of its gains already, although they, by and large, think it should rise solidly from here. Analysts on average predict the S&#38;P 500 will <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/sp500-outlook-increase-record-high-reflation-trade-us-stocks-2021-7\">rise around 10%</a> over the next 12 months, compared to its more than 35% gain over the previous year, according to estimates compiled by data firm FactSet.</p><p><a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-news-today-inflation-prices-cpi-sp500-dow-industrials-2021-7\">Strong inflation</a> and the potential for a rebound in bond yields are two worries for US investors, as they make stocks look less attractive. Potentially higher taxes and a natural slowdown in economic growth after the rebound over the first half of 2021 are two other concerns.</p><p><strong>European stocks could rise strongly as the rebound picks up speed</strong></p><p>At the heart of Wall Street&#39;s interest in European stocks is the fact that the rebound in the eurozone still has further to run compared to the US recovery.</p><p>&#34;The European economy is considerably earlier in its recovery than peers, which should ensure that growth momentum remains stronger for longer,&#34; Morgan Stanley analysts said in the bank&#39;s mid-year outlook.</p><p>Strong growth could act as a boon for the region&#39;s <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/index/stoxx_europe_600\">Stoxx 600</a> index, which has risen around 57% since its March 2020 low, compared to the S&#38;P 500&#39;s 90% increase.</p><p>The analysts added: &#34;European equities remain cheap and unloved in a global context with relative valuations close to long-term lows.&#34;</p><p>Strategists are also keen on Europe because it has more companies that are &#34;cyclical&#34; - that is, which stand to benefit from stronger growth and inflation. That compares favorably to the US, which has more &#34;growth&#34; stocks that fare well when inflation and bond yields are low like <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/tsla-stock\">Tesla</a> and <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/nflx-stock\">Netflix</a>.</p><p>BlackRock&#39;s strategists said in its recent mid-year outlook that cyclical sectors in Europe such as technology and financials &#34;could be well positioned to play catch up as the restart broadens beyond the US.&#34;</p><p>What&#39;s more, the European Union is set to launch a recovery fund in the second half of the year, Morgan Stanley said. It could release as much as $940 billion into economies over the next five years.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/european-stocks-wall-street-investment-strategy-us-rally-cools-2021-7'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=Qw-wxMkfHuE:VJjSP--mjwk:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=Qw-wxMkfHuE:VJjSP--mjwk:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=Qw-wxMkfHuE:VJjSP--mjwk:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=Qw-wxMkfHuE:VJjSP--mjwk:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=Qw-wxMkfHuE:VJjSP--mjwk:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=Qw-wxMkfHuE:VJjSP--mjwk:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=Qw-wxMkfHuE:VJjSP--mjwk:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=Qw-wxMkfHuE:VJjSP--mjwk:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/Qw-wxMkfHuE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 14 Jul 2021 15:32:31 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/60eefe9d61b8600019f1705d?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"a0bbbd65ae9df657281aa88616d485aa","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn35@2020_5/2021/07/14/17-34-00-971_9be2d3c71a4e3f3c.webp","destWidth":4158,"destHeight":3118,"sourceBytes":399030,"destBytes":399030,"author":"hrobertson@businessinsider.com (Harry Robertson)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/60eefea3a8d8c00019b031dc?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn57@2020_2/2021/07/14/17-34-04-199_45b91a743ba16a6d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn5@2020_2/2021/07/14/17-34-04-185_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=Qw-wxMkfHuE:VJjSP--mjwk:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn90@2020_6/2021/07/14/17-34-03-307_75b0ee6ed4f3fc2b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=Qw-wxMkfHuE:VJjSP--mjwk:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn28@2020_2/2021/07/14/17-34-01-524_dcf397cee3dee44e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn85@2020_2/2021/07/14/17-34-02-502_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=Qw-wxMkfHuE:VJjSP--mjwk:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn57@2020_2/2021/07/14/17-34-03-178_b233dcccade1a4e6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/Qw-wxMkfHuE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn54@2020_6/2021/07/14/17-34-02-137_a7f00b8be4878e7b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1626284019895},{"createdTime":"2021-07-15 01:33:39","updatedTime":"2021-07-15 01:33:39","title":"Remote work is expanding rapidly beyond typical white-collar worker industries","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/remote-job-postings-rise-construction-healthcare-logistics-says-linkedin-2021-7","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60eee920a8d8c00019b0312d?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Designer works at office desk.\" height=\"5109\" width=\"6812\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Back offices roles in construction and logistics are increasingly going remote.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Cravetiger via Getty.</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li><strong>The number of remote roles posted online has risen by as much as 19 times for some UK sectors, according to LinkedIn.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Remote roles in transport, construction, and retail have grown significantly.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>The rise has been fueled by growing acceptance of remote work, as well as an adoption of technology. </strong></li>\n<li id=\"recirc\"><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">See more stories on Insider&#39;s business page</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>The number of remote job roles being advertised has risen, making remote work a possibility for more workers.</p><p>But not all of these are in industries traditionally associated with remote work, with workers in transportation, retail and construction increasingly being offered a remote option. </p><p>LinkedIn&#39;s <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/remote-work-job-listings-rise-hiring-uk-recovering-rapidly-morrin/\">UK Workforce report</a> analyzed job postings on the site between June 2020 and June 2021. A job was classed as remote if it was explicitly labelled as such, or contained key phrases like &#34;work from home.&#34;</p><p>It generally found that the number of remote roles has risen across the board. </p><p>Unsurprisingly, white-collar industries more traditionally associated with working from home have seen levels of postings rise since June 2020. </p><p>As a sector, IT and software saw a 5.5x year-on-year increase in the overall percentage of available remote roles - one in five IT roles are now advertised as remote. In June 2020, 1.6% of finance roles were advertised as remote, which grew to 10.9% in 2021, a 7x year on year increase.</p><p>The largest increase however has been seen among transportation and logistics roles, which has seen remote roles rise 18.5x, to 5.6%, compared to June 2020 levels of 0.3%. </p><p>Other industries more traditionally associated with in workplace roles have seen an increase. Retail rose 11.6x, while construction experienced a 5.7x increase. </p><p>Healthcare, education and entertainment and travel also saw remote postings rise by 6.7x, 5.4x and 9.3x respectively. </p><h2><strong>The pandemic has introduced many to the idea of working remotely</strong></h2><p>&#34;Traditional office roles have naturally found it easier to pivot to a remote working style. From software engineers to media and communications professionals, workers across a myriad of sectors have shown they can work remotely if they need to by leaning on technology to stay connected,&#34; said Mariano Mamertino, senior economist, EMEA at LinkedIn. </p><p>&#34;But even in a field like healthcare, where in-person care is the very essence of many jobs, remote work is making surprising inroads.&#34;</p><p>Roles in project management, legal teams, blog editors and roles in utilization review are examples of some of the support functions that don&#39;t have to be done onsite, adds Mamertino.</p><p>The pandemic has also opened workers&#39; and executives&#39; eyes to the benefits of working from home in industries where they previously would not have, said Janine Chamberlin, UK country manager at LinkedIn.</p><p>&#34;Over the past year, many businesses have had to adapt to a fully remote model, which has been hard for some but has opened the doors to talent outside of the local area and to individuals who previously could not make it into an office.&#34;

Momentus&#39;s key offering was a &#34;microwave electro-thermal water plasma thruster,&#34; a way of zapping water vapor to propel a spacecraft, with the aim of transporting satellites into space.</p><p>But Momentus&#39;s propulsion tech failed to show results, according to SEC <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2021/comp-pr2021-124.pdf\">filings</a>. A test mission fell well short of the company&#39;s own benchmarks, and a former Momentus employee said that the test yielded &#34;no data to suggest that that thruster would deliver an impulse of any commercial significance.&#34;</p><p>That didn&#39;t stop the company&#39;s CEO, Mikhail Kokorich, from boasting of its successes.</p><p>&#34;Water plasma propulsion is now technologically mature enough to be baselined for operational in-space transportation missions,&#34; he told a trade publication in 2019, citing the Momentus test flight.</p><p>Meanwhile, Kokorich, who is a Russian citizen, had caught the eye of US authorities. CFIUS, a government body that scrutinizes foreign investment, flagged Kokorich as a national security threat, denying him permits and requiring him to divest from Momentus. </p><p>Kokorich&#39;s work visa was revoked. He applied for political asylum as a Russian dissident, but was denied. When the FBI and other agencies showed up at Momentus HQ to question employees, Kokorich was detained at an immigration detention center, though he was let go on bond.</p><p>Little of this was disclosed to investors. Despite Momentus disclosing in filings that it was &#34;highly dependent&#34; on Kokorich personally, he did not reveal his asylum application had been rejected. His presence at the company also prevented Momentus from getting crucial permits approved, according to the SEC.</p><p>The SEC is pursuing litigation against Kokorich in federal court, while all other parties have settled for a total penalty of $8 million. The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/99de2333-e53a-4084-8780-2ba9766c70b7\">$1.2 billion</a> SPAC deal could still go ahead, though the SEC is requiring that the company let investors pull out

href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/otly-stock\">Oatly</a> fell 6.1% to an all-time low of $19.40 Wednesday as short seller Spruce Point Capital Management accused the oat milk company of misleading investors on multiple fronts and overstating its revenue. <br><br>In a <a href=\"https://www.sprucepointcap.com/oatly-group-ab/\">report</a> published Wednesday, Spruce Point Capital Management said there is a long-term potential Oatly faces insolvency. </p><p>&#34;While investors are enamored with its sales growth in the plant-based food fad, and its commitment to ESG practices, we believe they should be focused on its loss of market share in Sweden and the U.S., minimal barriers to entry, lack of competitive advantages, rising commodity input costs, and supply challenges created partly through poorly planned production facilities,&#34; Spruce Point said. &#34;As such, we believe Oatly will sorely disappoint investors and will never achieve profitability.&#34;  <br><br>The short seller accused Oatly of shady accounting practices, claiming that the oat milk company has overstated its revenue and gross margin by 640 basis points. Spruce Point warned investors that Oatly has churned through three auditors in six years, and its CFO and audit chair were both involved in prior corporate accounting scandals. </p><p>In addition, Spruce Point said Oatly&#39;s nearly $12 billion valuation is unsustainable and will only hurt new investors. <br><br>&#34;Oatly&#39;s valuation has mysteriously ballooned nearly 6x since a $200m investment by Blackstone in July 2020 despite our evidence pointing to market share loss. Oatly is trading at 17x &#39;21E sales and 75x adjusted gross profit and a $12bn valuation (57% of the 2025 total projected non-dairy milk market),&#34; the short seller said. <br><br>Spruce Point is calling for Oatly&#39;s board to hire an independent forensic accountant to open an investigation the short seller&#39;s claims. </p><p>The short seller also blasted Oatly&#39;s ESG commitment, specifically the company&#39;s claims that its conversion from cow&#39;s milk to oat milk results in 80% fewer carbon emissions, 79% less land usage, and 60% less energy usage.</p><p>Oatly emphasized the claims on one of its <a href=\"https://investors.oatly.com/static-files/0bfad979-62b9-4d3d-84aa-6b112ee5c41b\">first slides</a> in its June investor presentation, but the data was from a 2013 study that didn&#39;t account for Oatly&#39;s recent expansion into the US and Asia.</p><p>&#34;In addition, we believe Oatly has &#34;cherry-picked&#34; the study&#39;s results by failing to show that its impact on water consumption is worse than dairy milk,&#34; said the short seller. &#34;Through a FOIA request, we learned that Oatly&#39;s production process also generates dangerous volumes of wastewater that requires it to build its own treatment facilities.&#34;

Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a note said tech behemoth <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/aapl-stock\">Apple</a> remains its top pick among large-cap tech names and that it would be buyers of <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/msft-stock\">Microsoft</a> and <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/zs-stock\">Zscaler</a>, among others. Apple and Microsoft shares on Tuesday hit all-time highs. </p><p>&#34;We believe June results and guidance around the corner over the coming weeks will be another positive catalyst for tech stocks and result in further multiple expansion as we see tech stocks up another 10%+ in [the second half of 2021] reflecting this good news,&#34; Ives wrote. </p><p>So far this year, the <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/index/nasdaq_100\">Nasdaq 100 index</a>, which includes Wall Street&#39;s largest tech and non-financial stocks, has advanced by 15%, and the broader <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/index/nasdaq_composite\">Nasdaq Composite</a> has bulked up by nearly 14%. Tech stocks have bounced back after a sell-off in March that was largely triggered by a rapid surge in long-dated government bond yields, implying higher borrowing costs. Yields steepened on expectations of hotter inflation in the face of higher government spending and the reopening of the economy hit hard by the pandemic. </p><p>The 16 months since the pandemic slammed into the US have led to a push in demand for cloud, e-commerce, cybersecurity, and other technology products and services. &#34;However, we believe massive growth (and further multiple expansion) is still on the horizon with tech stocks and FAANG names underestimating this surge of demand for the next 2-3 years,&#34; Ives said. </p><p>Wedbush expects spending for cloud and cybersecurity technology to surge in an effort to protect systems from cyber threats like the May ransomware attack against Colonial Pipeline, the largest fuel pipeline operator in the US. Wedbush sees a $200 billion growth opportunity in cloud security alone over the next few years. <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/vrns-stock\">Varonis Systems</a> and Zscaler remain among top picks in Wedbush&#39;s cybersecurity coverage. </p><p>Wedbush also said heading into the second half of the year it would own secular winners in the FAANG space, with Apple its favorite name, and cloud names including Microsoft, voice recording and data security company <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/nice-stock\">Nice</a> and customer relationship management software maker <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/pega-stock\">Pegasystems</a>.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

It's hottest in April and May, and the busiest seasons are during the Christmas holiday and spring break periods.&#160;</p><h2>What is the best Mexico hotel on the beach to avoid crowds?&#160;</h2><p>Secluded beaches dot the country's coastline. The island of Holbox is a small 26-mile island within the protected YUM Balam nature reserve and offers pristine, crowd-free beaches, enjoyed by hotels like <a href=\"https://www.villasflamingos.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Villas Flamingos</a> or the <a href=\"https://www.mystiqueresorts.com/resort/mystique-blue\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mystique Holbox</a> by Royalton.</p><p>Elsewhere, Four Seasons Punta Mita has the advantage of being located a short drive from Puerto Vallarta airport, but boasts a pair of very quiet beaches all to itself.</p><h2>Can I drink the water in Mexico?</h2><p>It's generally not a good idea to drink water from the tap in Mexico. Opt instead for bottled water, even while brushing your teeth. Be mindful of ice and avoid getting it in your drinks unless you can confirm it's made from safe water.&#160;</p><h2>Is it safe to stay in a hotel?</h2><p>While hotels do provide opportunities for face-to-face interactions with staff and other guests in common spaces like check-in desks, lobbies, and dining venues, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/are-hotels-safe-coronavirus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">experts say guests who exercise proper precautions</a> can stay safely in hotels.</p><p>However, no travel is completely risk-free right now and we recommend following CDC current guidelines as well as all applicable local protocols at the time of travel.</p><h2>Is Mexico safe for U.S. travelers?</h2><p><a href=\"https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/covid-3/coronavirus-mexico\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CDC advises</a> that unvaccinated travelers should avoid nonessential travel to Mexico. It currently lists Mexico as a Level 3 (out of 4) COVID level. See the CDC's <a href=\"https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/covid-3/coronavirus-mexico#vax\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">recommendations for fully vaccinated travelers</a> and <a href=\"https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/covid-3/coronavirus-mexico#unvax\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">recommendations for unvaccinated travelers</a>. Travelers should follow recommendations or requirements in Mexico, including wearing a mask and staying six feet apart from others.</p><h2>What are the best Mexico hotels for couples or families?</h2><p>As a parent of young children, I'll always pick a Four Seasons anywhere in the world for top-notch service that accommodates families indulgently and seamlessly, with included kids clubs and incredible all-seasons programming. So, the Four Seasons Punta Mita is my go-to pick in Mexico for families.</p><p>And while many of Mexico's most well-known adults-only resorts for couples are located in popular destinations like Cancun, couples seeking romance might find it a treat to visit a hotel like Casa Salles in less-frequently visited Tequila, where spirits tasting makes for memorable, grown-folks-only fun.</p>\n\tMore

region.</li>\n<li id=\"recirc\"><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">See more stories on Insider&#39;s business page</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>The US on Tuesday cautioned that companies that invest, provide venture capital, or have supply-chain ties to the Xinjiang region of China <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Xinjiang-Business-Advisory-13July2021-1.pdf\">&#34;run a high risk of violating U.S. law,&#34;</a> due to widespread reports of forced labor and other human rights violations against ethnic minorities in the region.</p><p>The US has accused China of committing genocide and crimes against humanity in Xinjiang, citing the arbitrary mass detention of mostly Muslim ethnic groups in the region in what the Chinese government calls &#34;re-education camps.&#34; The government has also <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-22278037\">forcibly sterilized, tortured, and sexually abused ethnic minority prisoners</a> in these camps, according to former detainees. </p><p>Companies who don&#39;t pull out of the region could violate statutes that criminalize benefitting from or importing goods that are the result of forced labor. The advisory also warned US companies against assisting in the development of surveillance tools for Xinjiang or supplying US-made goods to entities that use forced labor.</p><p>In 2020, activist groups accused some of the world&#39;s biggest fashion brands - including Nike and H&#38;M - of <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/uighur-forced-labor-global-brands-profited-activists-letter-2020-7\">sourcing cotton from factories that exploit the forced labor of Uyghurs</a> and other ethnic minorities. Over a million ethnic minorities have been detained in Xinjiang, a region that produces a fifth of world&#39;s cotton, and activist groups have called for companies to exit the region to avoid profiting from human rights violations in the area. </p><p>Nike <a href=\"https://purpose.nike.com/statement-on-xinjiang\">stated that it doesn&#39;t source products, textiles and yarn</a> from Xinjiang, and H&#38;M stated that it was <a href=\"https://www.voanews.com/east-asia-pacific/voa-news-china/hm-vows-regain-customers-after-backlash-over-uyghur-comments\">concerned about the accusations of forced labor</a> involved in Xinjiang cotton production.</p><p>In May, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-china-suppliers-uyghur-muslims-forced-labor-report-2021-5\">Apple suppliers were linked to forced labor in the Xinjiang region</a>, with reports that thousands of detained Uyghurs were used to manufacture components for Apple devices. Apple previously <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-china-suppliers-uyghur-muslims-forced-labor-report-2021-5\">denied exploiting forced labor</a> in Xinjiang.</p><p>In 2020, Apple and Nike, among other companies, also <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-nike-coca-cola-lobbied-china-uyghur-forced-labor-bill-2020-11\">lobbied to weaken the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act</a> that would ban US companies from importing goods made in Xinjiang unless they could prove they weren&#39;t made with forced labor. </p><p>According to Reuters, the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-state-department-warns-business-risk-linked-chinas-xinjiang-2021-07-13/\">US may impose additional sanctions on China</a> and may extend a similar business
