With the best web hosting, you can boost SEO, which helps in growing your products&#8217; outreach and sales.</p>\n<p>No matter if you&#8217;re starting your first blog on WordPress or your next business&#8217;s website on WordPress, <strong>a quality hosting service will save you</strong> a lot of troubles including almost zero to no downtimes and quick response on support issues. That&#8217;s the reason the best websites are hosted on the best-hosting services.</p>\n<p>The question arises: how to find the best web hosting services for WordPress? Fortunately, there are some websites that provide <strong>expert opinions and user reviews</strong> about the hosting services. These services help you to choose the best hosting provider per the reviews of hundreds if not thousands of real users.</p>\n<p>Finally, let me share the key factors of a hosting service for WordPress before I introduce you to the best five places to look for legitimate hosting reviews.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Server requirements &#8211;</strong> WordPress&#8217;s latest versions require PHP 5.6.20 or later, MySQL 5.0.15 or later, and Apache or Nginx with mod_rewrite.</li>\n<li><strong>Speed &#8211;</strong> The rule of thumb: <em>the faster, the better</em>. Your website must load within a second (you can check via <a href=\"https://www.hongkiat.com/blog/website-speed-and-performance-check-tools/\">website speed and performance tools</a>).</li>\n<li><strong>Uptime &#8211;</strong> The hosting service&#8217;s uptime must be greater than 99.9%. If it&#8217;s any lesser, you may lose probable customers and visitors on your website.</li>\n<li><strong>Support &#8211;</strong> The provider must provide 24/7 support &#8212; even if it&#8217;s just live chat. The reason being: you may need urgent support if your site is down.</li>\n<li><strong>Pricing &#8211;</strong> You&#8217;ll already know this: <em>the cheaper, the better</em>. But you must ensure that the website&#8217;s speed and uptime must not suffer for pricing.</li>\n</ul><h4><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://hostadvice.com/\">HostAdvice</a></h4>\n<p>HostAdvice is <strong>one of the best web hosting review services</strong>. It avails both user and expert reviews, allowing customers to compare prices, policies, support, and other features of the web hosting providers. Its expert opinions discuss the<strong> </strong>ease of use, pricing, speed and performance, and support of the hosting services.</p>\n<figure class=\"is-mega\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.hongkiat.com/uploads/wordpress-hosting-reviews/hostadvice-best-hosting-review-service.jpg\" width=\"1200\" height=\"621\" alt=\"HostAdvice - the best hosting review service\"></figure><h5>What&#8217;s good</h5>\n<ul><li><strong>Allows comparing</strong> two or more services side-by-side.</li>\n<li>Allows <strong>sorting reviews</strong> based on newest, helpful, best, etc.</li>\n<li>Offers <strong>discount codes</strong> (coupons) and plans and features details.</li>\n<li>Supports <strong>filtering reviews</strong> per service used, language, and the category of reviews like domain, pricing, reliability, speed, support, and more.</li>\n<li>Supports <strong>a list of tools</strong> such as Web Hosting Advisor, Plans Search, Who Is Hosting This Site?, etc. to help you find the best web hosting service.</li>\n</ul><h5>What&#8217;s bad</h5>\n<ul><li>Its design may <strong>appear a bit crowded</strong> since it offers a lot of information.</li>\n</ul><h4><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.whoishostingthis.com/compare/wordpress/\">WhoIsHostingThis</a></h4>\n<p>WhoIsHostingThis aims to provide you with expert reviews and resources along with user reviews to help you on choosing a web host. User reviews share info about hosting services&#8217; features, <strong>quality, support, and the overall value</strong>. On the contrary, expert opinions provide a highlight of their features in detail.</p>\n<figure class=\"is-mega\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.hongkiat.com/uploads/wordpress-hosting-reviews/whoishostingthis-expert-reviews-resources.jpg\" width=\"1200\" height=\"622\" alt=\"WhoIsHostingThis - expert reviews and resources\"></figure><h5>What&#8217;s good</h5>\n<ul><li><strong>Allows comparing hosting services</strong> based on the budget, server types, speciality hosting, programming languages, CMSs like WordPress, etc.</li>\n<li>Offers <strong>a library of useful resources</strong> to get started, like most services.</li>\n<li>Offers <strong>deals and discounts</strong>, mostly like HostAdvice.</li>\n</ul><h5>What&#8217;s bad </h5>\n<ul><li><strong>Doesn&#8217;t offer side-by-side comparison</strong> of web hosting services.</li>\n</ul><h4><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://digital.com/web-hosting/wordpress/\">Digital.com</a></h4>\n<p>Digital.com helps you find the best web hosting service by providing you ratings based on comments on Twitter. That is, it uses <strong>sentiment analysis algorithm</strong> on publicly-available comments and tweets about the web hosting services.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s why Digital.com is <strong>a one-of-its-kind review service</strong> that helps to share the voices of real people (though it can&#8217;t be accurate since Twitter has bots too!). However, it promises to mitigate some issues using machine learning.</p>\n<figure class=\"is-mega\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.hongkiat.com/uploads/wordpress-hosting-reviews/digital-com-best-web-hosting-services.jpg\" width=\"1200\" height=\"729\" alt=\"Digital.com - the best web hosting services\"></figure><h5>What&#8217;s good</h5>\n<ul><li>Offers <strong>side-by-side comparison</strong> between two services, like HostAdvice.</li>\n<li>Avails <strong>detail analysis and reviews</strong> on web hosting, website builders, and ecommerce builders, and resources on building and hosting a website.</li>\n<li>Offers <strong>coupons and discounts</strong> for the web hosts, like the above tools.</li>\n<li>Avails sections about <strong>CDNs and email</strong> platforms under <strong>More Services</strong>.</li>\n</ul><h5>What&#8217;s bad </h5>\n<ul><li><strong>Limited comparisons</strong> compared to the above hosting review services.</li>\n</ul><h4><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/wordpress-hosting/\">WPBeginner</a></h4>\n<p>WPBeginner &#8212; a site focusing on resources for WordPress &#8212; provides hosting reviews as well. It provides <strong>customer reviews and expert overviews</strong> on web hosting services which are focused on their performance, response time, hosting plans, customer support, and other features including pros and cons.</p>\n<figure class=\"is-mega\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.hongkiat.com/uploads/wordpress-hosting-reviews/wpbeginner-provides-hosting-reviews.jpg\" width=\"1200\" height=\"745\" alt=\"WPBeginner provides hosting reviews\"></figure><h5>What&#8217;s good</h5>\n<ul><li>Offers <strong>coupons and discount codes</strong>, like most review services.</li>\n<li>Provides <strong>performance statistics</strong> of the web hosts, unlike many others.</li>\n</ul><h5>What&#8217;s bad</h5>\n<ul><li>Focuses solely on <strong>the web hosts for WordPress</strong>, unlike other services.</li>\n</ul><h4><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.serchen.com/category/wordpress-hosting/\">Serchen Marketplace</a></h4>\n<p>Serchen is a marketplace and search engine, offering digital solutions for your business.
