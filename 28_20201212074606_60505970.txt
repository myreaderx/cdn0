She failed to secure the date and we booked something else in. 4.7k 245 1, Share\" title=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"454\"/> </div> </div> <div> <p> Submitted by: </p> </div> <div> Tagged: <a href=\"https://failblog.cheezburger.com/tag/marriage\">marriage</a> , <a href=\"https://failblog.cheezburger.com/tag/FAIL\">FAIL</a> , <a href=\"https://failblog.cheezburger.com/tag/cringe\">cringe</a> , <a href=\"https://failblog.cheezburger.com/tag/finance\">finance</a> , <a href=\"https://failblog.cheezburger.com/tag/relationships\">relationships</a> , <a href=\"https://failblog.cheezburger.com/tag/wedding\">wedding</a> , <a href=\"https://failblog.cheezburger.com/tag/ridiculous\">ridiculous</a> , <a href=\"https://failblog.cheezburger.com/tag/Reddit\">Reddit</a> </div> <div> <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2fcheezburger.com%2f13173765%2fwoman-shows-up-to-pay-deposit-day-before-wedding\" target=\"_blank\">Share on Facebook</a> </div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/failblog?a=9DKKUiXu9nM:Dhg01ByfFng:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/failblog?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/failblog/~4/9DKKUiXu9nM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 12 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":28,"bgimg":"https://i.chzbgr.com/thumb800/13173765/h4EF20D51/woman-shows-up-to-pay-deposit-the-day-before-her-actual-wedding","linkMd5":"70a613195c8b892d9304e360c1c349e1","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn10@2020_4/2020/12/12/07-45-35-043_adaadf8f9aaa82e6.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":420,"sourceBytes":56787,"destBytes":37264,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.chzbgr.com/full/9578433024/h4BAEBEC6/our-town-our-room-is-one-very-few-places-available-hold-wedding-receptions-birthday-parties-etc":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn55@2020_2/2020/12/12/07-45-37-244_111ed8b814d01b6c.webp","https://i.chzbgr.com/full/9578433280/h26441DD0/take-deposits-without-booking-form-and-dont-take-booking-forms-without-deposit-have-physically-come":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn75@2020_2/2020/12/12/07-45-42-808_5b72035610322341.webp","https://i.chzbgr.com/full/9578433536/hDA5106F5/d-hi-can-help-b-here-pay-deposit-my-wedding-ok-let-get-form-and-go-through-date-did-book-b-tomorrow":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn63@2020_4/2020/12/12/07-45-35-786_53611c9b65483d38.webp","https://i.chzbgr.com/full/9578433792/h6B6BA099/went-my-birthday-lunch-only-hold-date-two-weeks-someone-will-have-told-at-time-b-yeah-but-s-wedding":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn57@2020_3/2020/12/12/07-45-50-896_cdd3817f75daef6e.webp","https://i.chzbgr.com/full/9578434048/h6D16EDFB/pay-now-b-uh-dont-have-website-so-cant-do-anything-online-mob-she-cant-have-wedding-here-nope-sorry":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn32@2020_1/2020/12/12/07-45-43-268_771077a1e38546f0.webp","https://i.chzbgr.com/full/9578434560/h9DF6F161/day-before-s-due-take-place-she-failed-secure-date-and-booked-something-else-47k-245-1-share":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn84@2020_6/2020/12/12/07-45-44-019_811ee29dc9ddf666.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/failblog?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn27@2020_4/2020/12/12/07-45-40-909_ea6d8368e00da69f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/failblog/~4/9DKKUiXu9nM":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn35@2020_6/2020/12/12/07-45-34-665_ffb8f136d96cb011.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1607759114271},{"createdTime":"2020-12-12 15:45:14","updatedTime":"2020-12-12 15:45:14","title":"Weirdest Things Tourists Noticed About Foreign Countries","link":"https://cheezburger.com/13171973/weirdest-things-tourists-noticed-about-foreign-countries","description":"<div> <p>As a tourist you can sometimes have those moments when various unique corners of the world completely humble you.
