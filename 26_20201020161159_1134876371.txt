But last week, the company was reportedly preparing for layoffs, according to Dark Reading, which <a href=\"https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities---threats/nss-labs-shuttered/d/d-id/1339220\">first reported</a> news of the company&#8217;s shuttering.</p>\n<p>In a brief post on LinkedIn, NSS Labs&#8217; chief executive Jason Brvenik hinted at layoffs, adding: &#8220;If you are in need of excellent people that exceed my high standards, please get in touch.&#8221; (Brvenik listed himself as a former chief executive on his LinkedIn profile.)</p>\n<p>Former employees told TechCrunch that they had been laid off as a result of the company&#8217;s closure.</p>\n<p>NSS Labs, founded in 2007, was one of the most well-known product security testing companies, allowing customers to use real threat data to stress-test their products and discover potential vulnerabilities and security issues.</p>\n<p>But the last few years have been rocky. NSS Labs retracted its &#8220;caution&#8221; rating for CrowdStrike&#8217;s Falcon platform in 2019, after the two companies confidentially settled a lawsuit challenging the results. NSS Labs also dropped its antitrust suit against the Anti-Malware Testing Standards Organization (AMTSO), Symantec and ESET, after the testing giant claimed it had discovered evidence of the companies allegedly conspiring to make it harder to test their products.</p>\n<p>Spokespeople for NSS Labs and Consecutive did not immediately return requests for comment.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Send tips securely over Signal and WhatsApp to +1 646-755-8849.</em></p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=5GEDjaTGkKM:AnuGb0VxpQo:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=5GEDjaTGkKM:AnuGb0VxpQo:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=5GEDjaTGkKM:AnuGb0VxpQo:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=5GEDjaTGkKM:AnuGb0VxpQo:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=5GEDjaTGkKM:AnuGb0VxpQo:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=5GEDjaTGkKM:AnuGb0VxpQo:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=5GEDjaTGkKM:AnuGb0VxpQo:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=5GEDjaTGkKM:AnuGb0VxpQo:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/5GEDjaTGkKM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 20 Oct 2020 13:32:44 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"5160fb048a81a5e7b0d57d5545b624f2","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn39@2020_2/2020/10/20/16-11-13-384_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Zack Whittaker","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn39@2020_2/2020/10/20/16-11-13-384_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn55@2020_3/2020/10/20/16-11-47-474_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn19@2020_4/2020/10/20/16-11-46-472_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=5GEDjaTGkKM:AnuGb0VxpQo:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn87@2020_3/2020/10/20/16-11-47-578_23e6357cc7d4376a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=5GEDjaTGkKM:AnuGb0VxpQo:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn23@2020_4/2020/10/20/16-11-47-366_3d96141c65052aae.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn80@2020_4/2020/10/20/16-11-47-583_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/5GEDjaTGkKM":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn60@2020_4/2020/10/20/16-11-47-562_b2a3959201b3401b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603210268084},{"createdTime":"2020-10-21 00:11:08","updatedTime":"2020-10-21 00:11:08","title":"Google Photos revives its prints subscription service, expands same-day print options","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2063225","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/google\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"google\">Google <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> Photos is reviving its photo printing subscription service and introducing same-day prints.

Today, nobody would say that Google Chrome is a web explorer.</p>\n<p>Browsing the web has become an effortless — and often mindless —&#160;task.

And yet, web browsers represent infinite knowledge and infinite possibilities.</p>\n<p>If you’re very passionate about a niche topic, chances are you can learn a ton of things by reading stuff, watching videos, interacting on forums and more. But when you close your browser window, everything disappears.</p>\n<p>Sure, there’s a web history feature —&#160;but it’s a long list of links with no connection. Sure, you can bookmark pages or take notes in another app — but it’s a cumbersome process.</p>\n<p>More importantly, you might not know what’s important and what’s not. Most passion projects start with meaningless search queries.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2063308\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2063308\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Group-5.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"597\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2063308\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Group-5.png 2860w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Group-5.png?resize=150,87 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Group-5.png?resize=300,175 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Group-5.png?resize=768,448 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Group-5.png?resize=680,397 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Group-5.png?resize=1536,896 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Group-5.png?resize=2048,1194 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Group-5.png?resize=50,29 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2063308\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Beam&#8217;s mysterious logo. <small>Image Credits: <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/eyeclick\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"eyeclick\">Beam</small></p></div></p> <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a>\n<p>Beam aims to bring meaning to your web history. Every time you search for something, it creates a new note card. Beam passively follows users as they click on links, open new pages and spend time looking at stuff.</p>\n<p>When you close the tab, you have a new card — your search query is the title of the card and you can see all links under that note. You can then add text, remove links that weren’t that relevant, etc.</p>\n<p>By combining passive note creation with a tiny nudge when you close a tab, you get to reflect on your web activity. It’s a way to learn more about yourself and your habits. Sure, you may realize that you waste a ton of time. But you might also realize that you care more than you thought about cooking and Russian classical music.</p>\n<p>“From a certain point of view, I’m designing this for people who don’t take notes,” Leca said.</p>\n<p>But even if you use a note app, they interrupt you as you need to switch between multiple apps. Leca invested in <a href=\"https://roamresearch.com\">Roam Research</a> and likes it a lot. But he doesn’t think it solves that amnesia affect when you browse the web.</p>\n<p>The startup is already thinking about ways to expand beyond that simple concept. You could imagine a way to interact with content directly from your notes — click on a YouTube link to view the video directly in your card, click on a podcast link to see an automated transcript, etc.</p>\n<p>Eventually, Beam could let you share cards with other users.

Growing up in the Dominican Republic, they didn&#8217;t have access to computer science classes, but they did have access to the internet and they got the startup bug from reading U.S. tech publications like this one, and learned to code from YouTube videos and StackOverflow. They both came to college in the U.S. and both interned at large companies &#8212; Pladevall at Facebook and Portet worked at Metadata in New York.</p>\n<p>The idea came together because Pladevalll was part of a team at Facebook building a similar tool for internal use. He decided that it would be a viable commercial idea for companies without the resources of Facebook. He came together with his childhood friend and began building the company in January as the pandemic hit.</p>\n<p>He acknowledges the hardship of this year, but says it really helped them focus because there wasn&#8217;t anything else to do. While they are amazed at having $2.6 million in the bank, he says they still have the hunger that he believes is part of the immigrant founder ethos.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just hunger to just prove yourself and if coding is what it takes, learn how to code. If it&#8217;s going through an early visa process, which is by the way, way harder than raising millions of dollars and going through YC, in my opinion, [you do that]&#8221; he said. He said it&#8217;s about doing whatever it takes.</p>\n<p>As the two friends take their first steps as a company, they have some early customers and continue to refine the product. With today&#8217;s funding they have some lofty goals for the next year, which include building out that product, reaching $1 million in ARR and building distribution for the dashboard.</p>\n<p>If they can meet those goals, Pladevall says, they should be able to get their Series A. I wouldn&#8217;t bet against them.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"CgBaNcr4lq\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/14/as-low-code-startups-continue-to-attract-vc-interest-whats-driving-customer-demand/\">As low-code startups continue to attract VC interest, what&#8217;s driving customer demand?</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;As low-code startups continue to attract VC interest, what&#8217;s driving customer demand?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/14/as-low-code-startups-continue-to-attract-vc-interest-whats-driving-customer-demand/embed/#?secret=CgBaNcr4lq\" data-secret=\"CgBaNcr4lq\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=clkVIbIrgdw:t-qqRe0hJ2Y:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=clkVIbIrgdw:t-qqRe0hJ2Y:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=clkVIbIrgdw:t-qqRe0hJ2Y:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=clkVIbIrgdw:t-qqRe0hJ2Y:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=clkVIbIrgdw:t-qqRe0hJ2Y:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=clkVIbIrgdw:t-qqRe0hJ2Y:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=clkVIbIrgdw:t-qqRe0hJ2Y:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=clkVIbIrgdw:t-qqRe0hJ2Y:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/clkVIbIrgdw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 20 Oct 2020 14:00:34 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/teampic.jpeg?w=680","linkMd5":"98619f5eead50b38d269b95a19f35a1a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn31@2020_2/2020/10/20/16-11-32-573_d0f3596586c0f816.webp","destWidth":680,"destHeight":399,"sourceBytes":13988,"destBytes":13988,"author":"Ron Miller","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/teampic.jpeg?w=680":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn31@2020_2/2020/10/20/16-11-32-573_d0f3596586c0f816.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn39@2020_2/2020/10/20/16-11-13-384_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn55@2020_3/2020/10/20/16-11-47-474_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn19@2020_4/2020/10/20/16-11-46-472_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=clkVIbIrgdw:t-qqRe0hJ2Y:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn44@2020_5/2020/10/20/16-11-47-380_e4f61d0e730770af.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=clkVIbIrgdw:t-qqRe0hJ2Y:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn47@2020_1/2020/10/20/16-11-46-406_dff75bd53e6951c0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn80@2020_4/2020/10/20/16-11-47-583_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/clkVIbIrgdw":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn91@2020_1/2020/10/20/16-11-46-607_145a428560bfbce7.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603210268093},{"createdTime":"2020-10-21 00:11:08","updatedTime":"2020-10-21 00:11:08","title":"Stampli, an invoice management software startup, launches a payments product","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2063039","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a href=\"https://www.stampli.com/\">Stampli</a>, a collaborative invoice management software company, introduced a payments product today called <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/stampli\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"stampli\">Stampli <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> Direct Pay.</p>\n<p>The startup launched back in 2015 with a mission to simplify invoice management through collaboration (and a dash of AI). Interestingly, Stampli said it was uninterested at the time in providing a payments product alongside its collaborative suite, focusing instead on the process of procure to pay.</p>\n<p>This latest announcement marks a shift in the company&#8217;s thinking. Cofounder and CEO <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/feldmaneyal/\">Eyal Feldman</a> explained that conversations with customers revealed just how frustrated many organizations are with the current B2B payments landscape.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>Organizations have several options: cut and mail their own paper checks, use ACH, or sign on with a payments provider to use &#8216;e-payments.&#8217;</p>\n<p>Cutting and mailing checks is a pre-historic, time-intensive activity that doesn&#8217;t really belong in 2020, while ACH (which comes at a very low, flat cost) often groups multiple transactions into a single sum, making it difficult for accounting to reconcile individual line item purchases.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Under the misleading banner of “e-payments,” [payments providers] offer AP departments a rebate and promise vendors faster payment,&#8221; explained Feldman in a blog post. &#8220;However, in order for vendors to get the payment, they must accept payments as virtual credit cards, which come with up to a 3.5% credit card fee per transaction.&#8221;</p>\n<p>And many payments providers do not provide the data extracted from invoices and transactions back to the organization as a way to stay sticky.</p>\n<p>Stampli&#8217;s customers illuminated these problems for the startup, which used to be payments agnostic. With the launch of Stampli Direct Pay, the company is still payments flexible, letting organizations work with their existing or different payments providers. But Stampli now offers an option that aims to resolve many of these industry issues.</p>\n<p>Because Stampli&#8217;s core product already tracks all the contextual and relevant info for every transaction, that information is readily available during payment approval. Direct Pay also offers ACH as a payment option, but separates individual transactions out for easy reconciliation. And for customers who want to stick with checks, Stampli Direct Pay offers a service that allows customers to approve digital checks which come directly from their bank account with their signature, with Stampli handling printing, stamping, and mailing.</p>\n<p>Stampli also offers a vendor payment portal that extracts the needed data for each vendor and lets the customer own that data, which can be downloaded and taken to another payment provider.</p>\n<p>The company has spent the last four years solving an entirely different problem.</p>\n<p>Usually, teams purchase products or services and those invoices end up in the finance department with little to no context, setting off a game of duck duck goose within the organization as accountants try to get the information and approvals they need to pay out that vendor.</p>\n<p>Stampli, which has raised <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/30/stampli-raises-25-million-in-series-b-to-bring-ai-to-invoice-management/\">$32 million to date</a>, built out a collaborative platform that allows non-accountants to participate in the invoice management process in a way that&#8217;s straightforward and simple. Each invoice becomes a communications hub, allowing folks across various departments fill in the blanks and. answer questions about the purchase. Stampli also uses machine learning to recognize patterns around allocating costs, managing approval workflows, and the data that needs to be extracted from invoices.</p>\n<p>Each invoice is turned into its own communications hub, allowing people across departments to fill in the blanks and answer questions so that payments are handled as efficiently as possible. Moreover, Stampli uses machine learning to recognize patterns around how the organization allocates cost, manages approval workflows and what data is extracted from invoices.</p>\n<p>With the launch of Direct Pay, Stampli is poised to take on a variety of new competitors with an obvious differentiator. The company has processed more than $13 billion in invoices annually.</p>\n<p>The team has also grown to more than 100 employees.

How do you see the world through somebody else’s eyes?&#8221;</p>\n<p>A location-based social platform will likely rely on users actually going places, and the pandemic has largely dictated the app&#8217;s launch timing. Today, Gowalla is launching a waitlist, Williams says the app itself will launch in beta &#8220;in a number of cities&#8221; sometime in the first-half of next year. The team is also trying something unique with a smaller paid beta group called the &#8220;Street Team,&#8221; which will give users paying a flat $49 fee early access to Gowalla as well as &#8220;VIP membership,&#8221; membership to a private Discord group and some branded swag. A dedicated Street Team app will also launch in December.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=TdX4tHYvcdE:YV7JvjZ9n2Y:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=TdX4tHYvcdE:YV7JvjZ9n2Y:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=TdX4tHYvcdE:YV7JvjZ9n2Y:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=TdX4tHYvcdE:YV7JvjZ9n2Y:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=TdX4tHYvcdE:YV7JvjZ9n2Y:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=TdX4tHYvcdE:YV7JvjZ9n2Y:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=TdX4tHYvcdE:YV7JvjZ9n2Y:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=TdX4tHYvcdE:YV7JvjZ9n2Y:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/TdX4tHYvcdE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 20 Oct 2020 14:00:17 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/gowalla__founders-1.png?w=680","linkMd5":"adf4e461c43d253d4990da3eeb3adff3","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn27@2020_5/2020/10/20/16-11-08-394_dc1874dbfd795367.webp","destWidth":680,"destHeight":357,"sourceBytes":104462,"destBytes":104462,"author":"Lucas Matney","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/gowalla__founders-1.png?w=680":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn27@2020_5/2020/10/20/16-11-08-394_dc1874dbfd795367.webp","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/gowalla__model.png?w=680":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn46@2020_5/2020/10/20/16-11-46-637_e0b21b80dc26df4c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn39@2020_2/2020/10/20/16-11-13-384_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn55@2020_3/2020/10/20/16-11-47-474_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn19@2020_4/2020/10/20/16-11-46-472_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=TdX4tHYvcdE:YV7JvjZ9n2Y:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn28@2020_2/2020/10/20/16-11-47-367_1c7edf4a8161bef8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=TdX4tHYvcdE:YV7JvjZ9n2Y:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn91@2020_5/2020/10/20/16-11-47-599_a93edd913202bec1.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn80@2020_4/2020/10/20/16-11-47-583_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/TdX4tHYvcdE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn27@2020_1/2020/10/20/16-11-46-404_fcb25bfb556e6ef8.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603210268088},{"createdTime":"2020-10-21 00:11:08","updatedTime":"2020-10-21 00:11:08","title":"Sym raises $9M Series A for its security workflow platform","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2062788","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a href=\"https://symops.com/\">Sym</a>, a new platform that makes it easier for developers to integrate security and privacy workflows into their process, today announced that it has raised a $9 million Series A round led by Amplify Partners.

It&#8217;s kind of a naïve approach where I was like, &#8216;you know, what, I&#8217;m just going to build all the tools, someone needs to <em>do</em> HIPAA and open source it as like a black box thing.&#8221;</p>\n<p>What he realized, though, is that companies have their own security and governance workflows that tend to share the same core but also a lot of variabilities. So what Sym now does is offer these core tools and lets companies mix and match what they need from this developer-centric toolbox the company has created.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"hOKU2eM4T6\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/16/servicenow-updates-its-workflow-automation-platform/\">ServiceNow updates its workflow automation platform</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;ServiceNow updates its workflow automation platform&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/16/servicenow-updates-its-workflow-automation-platform/embed/#?secret=hOKU2eM4T6\" data-secret=\"hOKU2eM4T6\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8220;What we&#8217;re building is a set of workflow templates and primitives that map to that shared 20% core &#8212; and then a set of integrations that you can use to pull down those workflow templates, and codify that last mile variance by connecting those templates to all your different services,&#8221; Mohamedali explained.</p>\n<p>What&#8217;s interesting about this approach is that Sym offers a Python SDK and lets developers create these workflows and integrations with only a few lines of code. In part, that&#8217;s due to the company&#8217;s philosophy of putting engineers back into control of security &#8212; the same way DevOps allowed them to reclaim control over infrastructure and Q&#38;A. &#8220;DevOps is a thing. So now, DevSecOps needs to be a thing. We need to reclaim security. And we want to be the tool to do that with,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Mohamedali stressed that this was very much an opportunistic round, and for the next few months this raise won&#8217;t change anything in the company&#8217;s road map. But because Sym started signing up large customers &#8212; and had made commitments to them &#8212; now was a good time to raise, especially because the right partners came along. That means hiring more engineers, but over time, the company obviously also plans to build out its sales and marketing teams. The product itself, though, will remain in private beta until about the middle of next year. At that time, Sym will also launch a self-serve version of its platform.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"kKoEq83GkO\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/16/new-box-tools-should-help-ease-creation-of-digitally-driven-workflows/\">New Box tools should help ease creation of digitally driven workflows</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;New Box tools should help ease creation of digitally driven workflows&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/16/new-box-tools-should-help-ease-creation-of-digitally-driven-workflows/embed/#?secret=kKoEq83GkO\" data-secret=\"kKoEq83GkO\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=XrD3bZxrA80:omJlc0IrCgw:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=XrD3bZxrA80:omJlc0IrCgw:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=XrD3bZxrA80:omJlc0IrCgw:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=XrD3bZxrA80:omJlc0IrCgw:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=XrD3bZxrA80:omJlc0IrCgw:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=XrD3bZxrA80:omJlc0IrCgw:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=XrD3bZxrA80:omJlc0IrCgw:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=XrD3bZxrA80:omJlc0IrCgw:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/XrD3bZxrA80\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 20 Oct 2020 15:00:20 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/handler.py_.png","linkMd5":"dc46fa62b6bdb86f72018bd2df82b7bd","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn36@2020_1/2020/10/20/16-11-08-435_efd8d054e90f4ee4.webp","destWidth":1244,"destHeight":732,"sourceBytes":174348,"destBytes":32862,"author":"Frederic Lardinois","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/handler.py_.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn36@2020_1/2020/10/20/16-11-08-435_efd8d054e90f4ee4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn39@2020_2/2020/10/20/16-11-13-384_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn55@2020_3/2020/10/20/16-11-47-474_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn19@2020_4/2020/10/20/16-11-46-472_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=XrD3bZxrA80:omJlc0IrCgw:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn55@2020_5/2020/10/20/16-11-46-580_572955d243847541.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=XrD3bZxrA80:omJlc0IrCgw:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn63@2020_3/2020/10/20/16-11-47-418_53f16dfd58433795.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn80@2020_4/2020/10/20/16-11-47-583_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/XrD3bZxrA80":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn11@2020_3/2020/10/20/16-11-46-470_a14cfa053abc4075.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603210268090},{"createdTime":"2020-10-21 00:11:08","updatedTime":"2020-10-21 00:11:08","title":"Pickle app puts on users, as millennials/Gen-Z latch onto location apps to fight Covid lockdowns","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2063229","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">As the coming of winter combined with the coronavirus continues to put new restrictions on peoples’ movements, location-based apps are on the rise again.

Three wheels, open cockpit, and a design reminiscent of the Batmobile. It draws a crowd and is a blast to drive.</p>\n<p>I spent several weeks in the reworked Polaris Slingshot. The company just unveiled a new version that is finally available with an automatic transmission. Past versions were limited to a standard transmission, radically limiting the 3-wheeler&#8217;s market to those who can drive a stick. But now, with a slushbox, the Slingshot is ready for the masses.</p>\n<p>I just wish a gas engine didn&#8217;t power the Slingshot.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>[gallery ids=\"2063236,2063239,2063235,2063238,2063237\"]</p>\n<p>The Slingshot is a thrilling ride. Is it like a motorcycle? Not really. Driving and riding in the Slingshot is akin to a go-kart or side-by-side ATV. The noises and feels are similar. It shifts hard, revs to infinity, and the wind is always in your face. It&#8217;s a blast.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s get this out of the way: The Slingshot is not fast. Sure, it&#8217;s quick for its size, but it&#8217;s slower than it looks.</p>\n<p>Thrills can be had even without breakneck speed. Without doors or a top, the Slingshot offers a driving experience offered in few vehicles.</p>\n<p>Once warmed up, the Slingshot is eager to please. The tach goes to 10k and redlines around 8,500. Mashing the go-pedal sends the needle soaring and the rear tire screeching. And off you go.</p>\n<p>The Slingshot was seemingly designed to power slide through corners. With the power going only to the single rear tire, the Slingshot easily loses traction, allowing for dramatic slide slides.</p>\n<p>The thrilling ride makes up for the lack of raw speed. What are normally mundane drives are elevated to mini adventures. That is if you let the Slingshot warm up a bit.</p>\n<p>She&#8217;s a cold-hearted lady, an uncle used to proclaim about his early eighties red Chevy Custom Deluxe pickup. This truck hauled as long as you gave the truck some time to warm up. The same thing is true with the Slingshot. Mass the gas pedal after just starting it up, and you&#8217;ll be greeted with shifts as rough as a dirt road.</p>\n<p>My first impression of the new Slingshot was not a good one. I unloaded the Slingshot from the delivery semi, hopped in, and floored it. A long second later, as the transmission shifted from first to second, I discovered this was a bad idea. I immediately thought the Slingshot&#8217;s transmission is seemingly controlled by someone changing gears with a sledgehammer.</p>\n<p>During my first drive, I concluded the new automatic Slingshot to be terrible before reaching the top gear. I was wrong. Once warm, the Slingshot improves but still lacks the shifting refinement of even the most basic automatic car. Even when warmed up, shifts in traffic are clunky and hard. When the driver can power through each gear, shifts on the open road are better but still rough.</p>\n<p>The transmission feel is my main concern with the Slingshot. Adding an automatic option opens the door to new buyers, but buyers must understand that the Slingshot is more ATV than a car.</p>\n<p>Want a refined open-top roadster? Get a Mazda MX-5. Want a thrilling open ride? The Slingshot is a great option.</p>\n<p>Polaris introduced the Slingshot in 2014, and I was lucky enough to drive one of the first in the country. That version was powered by a General Motors four-cylinder engine that provided ample power for the small frame. This time around, Polaris used its own four cylinder and mated it with an automatic gearbox.</p>\n<p>The Slingshot in this new form is still thrilling, but the lackluster gearbox erases some of its potential and makes a case for an electric Slingshot.</p>\n<p>Much of my hesitation about the automatic Slingshot would be erased if an electric motor powered the vehicle.</p>\n<p>One, with an electric powertrain, the vehicle would dump the lackluster automatic transmission in favor of a direct drive system. It would still be accessible to the target market and yet gain a better driving experience. With the electric system, the Slingshot would be quicker off the line and around corners. It would be fast while still thrilling.</p>\n<p>Two, the Slingshot doesn&#8217;t make a pleasant noise. Muscle cars deserve an exhaust note that expresses the gravitas of the motor. The Slingshot is not a muscle car, and the current exhaust note can only be described as being similar to an obnoxious go-kart. I spent much of my time in the Slingshot cruising through Michigan&#8217;s corn-lined back roads. I could smell the fresh corn while the sun beat down on my face. I love a loud exhaust as much as any dummy, but as I was driving through those backroads, I wished the Slingshot didn&#8217;t produce such a racket. An electric powertrain would improve the experience of the open-top machine.</p>\n<p>And finally, an electric powertrain would make the Slingshot as fast as it deserves. As stated above, the Slingshot is not as fast as it looks. Quick? Sure. But it&#8217;s not fast, and an electric powertrain would address this shortcoming by offering more torque at the start giving it the speed the Slingshot deserves.</p>\n<p>Of course, Polaris probably will not heed my electrification advice. I doubt it&#8217;s possible to make the Slingshot electric and maintain the same $30,000 price. A boy can still dream.</p>\n<p>The Slingshot is a lot of fun, and the fun comes at a cost. In the end, with the crummy automatic transmission limits the appeal of the Slingshot. Even in the best circumstances, shifts are rough and off-putting and not up to par for passenger vehicles. ATV enthusiasts can probably live with the shifts; everyone else should cross-shop the Slingshot with something like a Mazda MX-5, or even a used BMW Z3. Or, better yet, learn a life-long skill and learn to drive a stick shift, and buy the Slingshot with the standard transmission.</p>\n<p>Adding an electric powertrain to the Slingshot would considerably improve the vehicle. It would likely be faster and more enjoyable to drive since a smooth, direct-drive sensation would replace the hard shifts.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"sgUVnMbJoe\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/09/2020-bentley-flying-spur-review-superior-comfort-and-performance/\">2020 Bentley Flying Spur review: Superior comfort and performance</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;2020 Bentley Flying Spur review: Superior comfort and performance&#8221;

Rosen, deputy Attorney General in his statement. &#8220;Google achieved some success in its early years and no one begrudge that. But as the antitrust complaint filed today explains it has maintained its monopoly power through exclusionary practices that are harmful to come petition. So the Justice Department has determined that an antitrust response is necessary to benefit consumers.</p>\n<p>If the government does not enforce the antitrust laws to enable competition, we could lose the next wave of innovation. If that happens, Americans may never get to see the next Google.&#8221; He said that the DoJ plans to continue its review of anti-competitive practices by market-leading online platforms.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>In the suit, the Justice Department is expected to argue that Google used anticompetitive practices to safeguard its monopoly position as the dominant force in search and search-advertising, which sit at the foundation of the company&#8217;s extensive advertising, data mining, video distribution, and information services conglomerate.</p>\n<p>It would be the first significant legal challenge that Google has faced from U.S. regulators despite years of investigations into the company&#8217;s practices.</p>\n<p>A 2012 attempt to bring the company to the courts to answer for anti-competitive practices was ultimately scuttled because regulators at the time weren&#8217;t sure they could make the case stick.

The company dominates the search market &#8212; with roughly 90% of the world&#8217;s internet searches conducted on its platform &#8212; and roughly three quarters of American adults turn to YouTube for video, as the Journal reported.</p>\n<p>Google later issued a brief statement in response to the DoJ suit.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Today’s lawsuit by the Department of Justice is deeply flawed,&#8221; the company said. &#8220;People use Google because they choose to &#8212; not because they&#8217;re forced to or because they can&#8217;t find alternatives.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Today’s lawsuit by the Department of Justice is deeply flawed.

We appreciate the strong bipartisan cooperation among the states and the good working relationship with the DOJ on these serious issues,&#8221; read the statement. &#8220;This is a historic time for both federal and state antitrust authorities, as we work to protect competition and innovation in our technology markets. We plan to conclude parts of our investigation of Google in the coming weeks. If we decide to file a complaint, we would file a motion to consolidate our case with the DOJ&#8217;s. We would then litigate the consolidated case cooperatively, much as we did in the Microsoft case.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;We do have a line of communication open with them and we&#8217;ve appreciated the collaboration that we&#8217;ve had. And the cooperative relationship that we&#8217;ve had with all the states working through the investigation,&#8221; said Rosen today. &#8220;There have been some states that chose to join this complaint and some states that are choosing to proceed on their own path but not out of a lack of support for what the concerns are.&#8221;</p>\n<p>A third suit is being put together by the state of Texas, although that has <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/05/texas-ag-paxton-says-google-delaying-antitrust-investigation.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">faced its own issues</a>.</p>\n<p>While a number of tech leviathans are facing increasing scrutiny from Washington, with the US now just two weeks from Election Day, it&#8217;s unlikely that we are going to see many developments around this and other cases before then. And in the case of this specific Google suit, in the event that Trump doesn&#8217;t get re-elected, there will also be a larger personnel shift at the DoJ that could also change the profile and timescale of the case.</p>\n<p>In any event, fighting these regulatory cases is always a long, drawn-out process. In Europe, Google has faced a series of fines over antitrust violations stretching back several years, including a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/27/google-fined-e2-42bn-for-eu-antitrust-violations-over-shopping-searches/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">$2.7 billion fine</a> over Google shopping; a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/18/google-gets-slapped-5bn-by-eu-for-android-antitrust-abuse/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">$5 billion fine</a> over Android dominance; and a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/20/google-fined-1-49bn-in-europe-for-antitrust-violations-in-search-ad-brokering/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">$1.7 billion fine</a> over search ad brokering.

Co. who advised large banks, Klar blends Moller&#8217;s work experience in Mexico with his connections to the German banking world and the tech team at <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/berlin\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"berlin\">Berlin <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a>-based <a href=\"https://n26.com/en-us/homepage_vs_performancepage_v1?device=c&#38;gclid=CjwKCAjwlbr8BRA0EiwAnt4MTt0jASLfHWryW-nH9aUtBJ8CwoRh-e2dj6Gpt_cxpp1pNqXRMNSHJhoCaSUQAvD_BwE&#38;loc_physical_ms=9010929&#38;matchtype=e&#38;utm_campaign=6458052677&#38;utm_content=78962899122&#38;utm_medium=br&#38;utm_source=google&#38;utm_term=n26\">n26</a>, to create a challenger bank offering deposit and credit services for Mexican customers.</p>\n<p>The Mexican market is woefully underserved when it comes to the finance industry, according to Moller. Only 10% of Mexican adults have a credit card, something Moller said is the cheapest consumer lending instrument around.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">That&#8217;s why Klar launched last year with both credit and debit services. The company has 200,000 banking customers and roughly 27,000 of those customers have taken out loans through the bank. A typical loan is roughly $110, according to Moller, and each loan comes with a 68% annual percentage rate. </span></p>\n<p>If that sounds usurious, that&#8217;s because it is &#8212; at least by U.S. standards. In the U.S. a typical credit card will run somewhere between 16% and 24%, according to data from WalletHub. In Mexico, Moller said the typical interest rate is 70% (no wonder only 10% of adults have credit cards).</p>\n<p>Still, the opportunity to expand credit and debit services made sense to Prosus, which led the company&#8217;s Series A round alongside investors including the <a href=\"http://www.ifc.org\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">International Finance Corporation</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and former investors </span><a href=\"https://quona.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Quona capital</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, who led Klar´s SEED round, </span><a href=\"https://www.mourocapital.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mouro Capital</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (formerly Santander Innoventures) and aCrew. </span></p>\n<p>Banafsheh Fathieh, the <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/prosus-ventures\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"prosus-ventures\">Prosus Ventures <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> principal who led the investment for the firm, said that the commitment to Klar will likely be the first of many investments that her firm makes in the region &#8212; both in fintech and likely in Mexico&#8217;s tech ecosystem more broadly.</p>\n<p>Prosus is famous for making early bets on emerging technology companies in developing markets. Perhaps most famously the firm&#8217;s parent company was an early investor in Tencent &#8212; a multi-million dollar bet that has generated billions in returns.</p>\n<p>Before this investment, Prosus had confined its work in the Latin American region to investments in Brazilian technology companies like <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/creditas\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"creditas\">Creditas <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> and <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/movile-latin-america\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"movile-latin-america\">Movile <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a>.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Prosus Ventures partners with entrepreneurs that are solving big societal problems with technology, in a uniquely local way. We invest in sectors of the economy where technology can lead to meaningful change in the lives of consumers. Klar has identified a massive need in the Mexican financial market and brings a unique solution through their credit and debit offering,&#8221; said Banafsheh Fathieh from Prosus Ventures, in a statement. &#8220;In less than a year, the team has shown an ability to build a world-class digital bank for the masses, one focused on financial access and inclusion. We are very excited to partner with them on that mission.&#8221;</span></p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=FlLeZFdlpRU:eEngPx4lzZU:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=FlLeZFdlpRU:eEngPx4lzZU:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=FlLeZFdlpRU:eEngPx4lzZU:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=FlLeZFdlpRU:eEngPx4lzZU:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=FlLeZFdlpRU:eEngPx4lzZU:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=FlLeZFdlpRU:eEngPx4lzZU:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=FlLeZFdlpRU:eEngPx4lzZU:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=FlLeZFdlpRU:eEngPx4lzZU:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/FlLeZFdlpRU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 20 Oct 2020 15:01:06 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"c470ca089898f5087d0adb6d301e9ac1","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn39@2020_2/2020/10/20/16-11-13-384_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Jonathan Shieber","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn39@2020_2/2020/10/20/16-11-13-384_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn55@2020_3/2020/10/20/16-11-47-474_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn19@2020_4/2020/10/20/16-11-46-472_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=FlLeZFdlpRU:eEngPx4lzZU:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn7@2020_2/2020/10/20/16-11-47-257_d6a5c43a2c12f79d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=FlLeZFdlpRU:eEngPx4lzZU:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn76@2020_4/2020/10/20/16-11-47-734_232c6e619e6ee365.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn80@2020_4/2020/10/20/16-11-47-583_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/FlLeZFdlpRU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn16@2020_4/2020/10/20/16-11-46-396_c7b49f68b984276e.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603210268088},{"createdTime":"2020-10-21 00:11:08","updatedTime":"2020-10-21 00:11:08","title":"Unusual Ventures’ Sarah Leary and John Vrionis join Extra Crunch Live today at 2 p.m. ET/11 a.m. PT","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2063067","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Today at 2 p.m. ET/11 a.m. PT, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/unusual-ventures\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"unusual-ventures\">Unusual Ventures&#8217; <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/person/sarah-leary\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"sarah-leary\">Sarah Leary <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> and John Vrionis are joining us over at the Extra Crunch Live stage!</p>\n<p>The Unusual Ventures team has investments spanning the consumer and enterprise space, including Robinhood, AppDynamics, Mulesoft, Winnie and more.

studio","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2063014","description":"<p dir=\"ltr\">Even as Blizzard pulls the plug on new updates for its StarCraft II game, nearly a decade after its launch, gaming investors are financing the next new thing coming from key members of the game&#8217;s early development team.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Blizzard vets Tim Morten, the former production director for StarCraft II; and Tim Campbell, the lead campaign designer for WarCraft III; have launched a new studio with a number of colleagues from Blizzard to bring real time strategy games to a bigger audience.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The new company, <a href=\"https://www.frostgiant.com/\">Frost Giant Studios</a>, has picked up $4.7 million in seed funding from the gaming and synthetic media focused investment firm, Bitkraft Ventures, along with participation from 1 Up Ventures, GC Tracker, Riot Games, and Griffin Gaming Partners, the company said.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">“Frost Giant Studios is on a mission to bring one of the most beloved genres to a broader audience,&#8221; said Scott Rupp, Founding General Partner at Bitkraft Ventures. “We are excited to see some of the most experienced leaders in real-time strategy game development come together to build a game that will secure the future growth of the RTS genre while staying true to the core player fantasy of RTS.”</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Building on their experience developing StarCraft II over the past ten years, the Frost Giant Studios strategy is focused on making gameplay better, easier, and more collaborative.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Think of it as taking some of the best elements of the battle royal genre and bringing them into real-time strategy games with an eye toward playability and competitive opportunities in esports.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&#8220;Real-time strategy players are an incredibly passionate community, and they deserve not just a great new game, but one they can share broadly with friends. Building a worthy successor will take time, but we&#8217;re incredibly excited and grateful to carry real-time strategy forward at Frost Giant Studios,&#8221; said Tim Morten, Frost Giant Studios CEO.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=uQktUQi9C8Q:b0-QC_v8xPc:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=uQktUQi9C8Q:b0-QC_v8xPc:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=uQktUQi9C8Q:b0-QC_v8xPc:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=uQktUQi9C8Q:b0-QC_v8xPc:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=uQktUQi9C8Q:b0-QC_v8xPc:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=uQktUQi9C8Q:b0-QC_v8xPc:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=uQktUQi9C8Q:b0-QC_v8xPc:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=uQktUQi9C8Q:b0-QC_v8xPc:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/uQktUQi9C8Q\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 20 Oct 2020 15:03:50 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"5515fd2ab6f2fd431bccafa7d425d81e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn39@2020_2/2020/10/20/16-11-13-384_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Jonathan Shieber","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn39@2020_2/2020/10/20/16-11-13-384_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn55@2020_3/2020/10/20/16-11-47-474_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn19@2020_4/2020/10/20/16-11-46-472_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=uQktUQi9C8Q:b0-QC_v8xPc:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn68@2020_1/2020/10/20/16-11-46-464_2e6f54f0911034f7.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=uQktUQi9C8Q:b0-QC_v8xPc:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn83@2020_1/2020/10/20/16-11-46-617_425fe5cf479e6569.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn80@2020_4/2020/10/20/16-11-47-583_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/uQktUQi9C8Q":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn60@2020_5/2020/10/20/16-11-46-485_aa20035d6c62c650.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603210268088},{"createdTime":"2020-10-21 00:11:08","updatedTime":"2020-10-21 00:11:08","title":"Instagram rolls out fan badges for live videos, expands IGTV ads test","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2063179","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/instagram\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"instagram\">Instagram <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> is today introducing a new way for creators to make money.

Many of them dedicate their life to this, and it’s so important to us that they have easy ways to make money from their content,&#8221; said Instagram COO Justin Osofsky, in a statement. &#8220;These are additional steps in our work to make Instagram the single best place for creators to tell their story, grow their audience, and make a living,&#8221; she added.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Instagram today is expanding access to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/06/igtv-ads/\">its IGTV ads test</a> to more creators. This program, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/27/instagram-to-test-new-revenue-streams-including-badges-and-igtv-ads/\">introduced this spring</a>, allows creators to earn money by including ads alongside their videos.

In Q2, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/30/facebook-fb-earnings-q2-2020.html\">Facebook also reported monthly active user growth</a> (from 2.99B to 3.14B in Q1) that it said reflected increased engagement from consumers who were spending more time at home.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=J-esQ_F1VaA:cRB2WLCHVcY:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=J-esQ_F1VaA:cRB2WLCHVcY:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=J-esQ_F1VaA:cRB2WLCHVcY:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=J-esQ_F1VaA:cRB2WLCHVcY:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=J-esQ_F1VaA:cRB2WLCHVcY:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=J-esQ_F1VaA:cRB2WLCHVcY:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=J-esQ_F1VaA:cRB2WLCHVcY:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=J-esQ_F1VaA:cRB2WLCHVcY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/J-esQ_F1VaA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 20 Oct 2020 14:07:43 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GTM-1080x1080-Orange-UP_KORedyoungezee.png?w=680","linkMd5":"da686e5d7f0b2cb218a9d4e2eedb1c11","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn5@2020_3/2020/10/20/16-11-08-449_ded354c155162c2b.webp","destWidth":680,"destHeight":680,"sourceBytes":394057,"destBytes":22548,"author":"Sarah Perez","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GTM-1080x1080-Orange-UP_KORedyoungezee.png?w=680":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn5@2020_3/2020/10/20/16-11-08-449_ded354c155162c2b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn39@2020_2/2020/10/20/16-11-13-384_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn55@2020_3/2020/10/20/16-11-47-474_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn19@2020_4/2020/10/20/16-11-46-472_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=J-esQ_F1VaA:cRB2WLCHVcY:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn30@2020_6/2020/10/20/16-11-46-682_84a6319c3807ecc0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=J-esQ_F1VaA:cRB2WLCHVcY:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn12@2020_2/2020/10/20/16-11-47-455_20c4794e0c1c19ef.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn80@2020_4/2020/10/20/16-11-47-583_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/J-esQ_F1VaA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn59@2020_3/2020/10/20/16-11-48-448_fcab6f2627d113eb.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603210268089},{"createdTime":"2020-10-21 00:11:08","updatedTime":"2020-10-21 00:11:08","title":"Venn, a network hoping to be gaming’s answer to MTV, raises $26 million","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2062992","description":"<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.venn.tv\">VENN</a> , the streaming network hoping to be gaming culture&#8217;s answer to MTV, has raised $26 million to bring its mix of video game-themed entertainment and streaming celebrity features to the masses.</p>\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\">The financing came from previous investor Bitkraft, one of the largest funds focused on the intersection of gaming and synthetic reality, and new investor Nexstar Media Group, a publicly traded operator of regional television broadcast stations and cable networks around the U.S.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"RrWdZfpvxl\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/17/meet-venn-the-company-hoping-to-build-mtv-for-the-gaming-generation/\">Meet VENN, the company hoping to build MTV for the gaming generation</a></p></blockquote><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Meet VENN, the company hoping to build MTV for the gaming generation&#8221;

Carter said in a statement. &#8220;Gaming and esports are two fast growing sectors and through our investment we plan to distribute VENN content across our broadcast platform to address a younger audience; utilize VENN to gain early access to gaming-adjacent content; and present local and national brands with broadcast and digital marketing and advertising opportunities to reach younger audiences.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s unclear how much traction with younger audiences Venn has. The company&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjhfuditlW14fHaV2yrVH-g\">YouTube</a> channel has 14,000 subscribers and its <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/watchvenn\">Twitch Channel</a> boasts a slightly more impressive 57.7 thousand subscribers. Still, it&#8217;s early days for the streaming network, which only began airing its first programming in September.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/17/meet-venn-the-company-hoping-to-build-mtv-for-the-gaming-generation/\">its launch a little over a year ago</a>, Venn has managed to poach some former senior leadership from Viacom&#8217;s MTV and MTV Music Entertainment Group, which has been the model the gaming-focused streaming network has set for itself. Jeff Jacobs, the former senior vice president for production planning, strategies and operations at MTV&#8217;s parent company, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/viacom\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"viacom\">Viacom <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> and most recently an independent producer for <span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">Viacom, the NBA, Global Citizen and ACE Universe. </span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Venn is currently available on its own website and various streaming services as well as through partnerships with the <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/roku\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"roku\">Roku <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> Channel, Plex, Xumo, Samsung TV Plus and Vizio.</p>\n<p>The company has
