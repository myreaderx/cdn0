Following the US withdrawal, Tehran began breaching the terms of the agreement, including over the amount and purity of uranium it can store and produce.</p> \n<blockquote> \n <span><strong>Also on rt.com</strong></span> \n <figure> \n  <img src=\"https://cdni.rt.com/files/2021.05/thumbnail/609fbab72030270c410ae5df.JPG\" alt=\"Israel’s flag is flown atop the federal chancellery building in Vienna, Austria, May 15, 2021. © Lisi Niesner / Reuters\" /> \n  <figcaption>\n   <a href=\"https://www.rt.com/news/523912-iran-cancels-visit-austria/\">Iran’s foreign minister cancels visit to Austria after Israeli flag was flown in Vienna amid Gaza flare-up</a>\n  </figcaption> \n </figure> \n</blockquote> \n<p>On Wednesday, Mora’s optimism over a potential breakthrough was shared by some of the other delegations representing the JCPOA’s original signatories, who have been helping mediate talks. Mikhail Ulyanov, the Russian ambassador to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said in a tweet that participants noted that <em>“good”</em> or <em>“significant”</em> progress had been made and that an agreement was <em>“within reach.</em>”</p> \n<p><em>“The Joint Commission will resume its work early next week. Hopefully, the 5th round will be final,”</em> he added.</p> \n<p>Iran’s top negotiator at the talks, Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi, also reported <em>“good progress”</em> during the negotiations.</p> \n<p>In a sign of more specific movement by Washington and Tehran, he also said the main body of the text was <em>“almost ready,”</em> save for <em>“a few complex disputes”</em> requiring discussion with the governments of the countries involved.</p> \n<blockquote> \n <span><strong>Also on rt.com</strong></span> \n <figure> \n  <img src=\"https://cdni.rt.com/files/2021.05/thumbnail/609a98c185f5401de4056ed1.JPG\" alt=\"Parties attend a meeting of the JCPOA Joint Commission in Vienna, Austria (FILE PHOTO) © EU Delegation in Vienna/Handout via REUTERS\" /> \n  <figcaption>\n   <a href=\"https://www.rt.com/news/523494-iran-jcpoa-nuclear-french-deal/\">‘Significant disagreements remain’ on Iran nuclear deal, says French foreign ministry as Vienna stalemate continues</a>\n  </figcaption> \n </figure> \n</blockquote> \n<p>In addition, Mora said work was continuing between Iran and the IAEA to extend a temporary monitoring agreement to allow the UN nuclear watchdog to carry out the necessary inspections of Iranian nuclear activities.</p> \n<p>A temporary three-month monitoring agreement in place since February is due to expire on May 21, by which time officials hope a deal can be reached, according to Reuters.</p> \n<p>US President Joe Biden has expressed a willingness to reverse Trump’s withdrawal from the JCPOA on the condition that Iran returns to its obligations under the deal.</p> \n<p>During previous rounds of talks, Iranian negotiators said the US must lift sanctions before it returns to its commitments under the deal.</p> \n<p><strong><em>Like this story?
