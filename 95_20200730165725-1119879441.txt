Scheduling HVAC preventative maintenance ensures it performs properly and prolongs the lifespan of your unit. Neglecting your system could lead to inefficient performance and system failure. There are several HVAC maintenance tasks you can complete on your own, however, some require an HVAC specialist. In this guide, we outline the dos and don&#8217;ts of HVAC maintenance.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>DO: Seasonal HVAC preventative maintenance</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At least two times per year, schedule HVAC preventative maintenance with a professional technician. <a href=\"https://www.goodmanmfg.com/resources/hvac-learning-center/maintenance/seasonal-heating-and-air-conditioning-maintenance\">Maintenance</a> should involve a furnace or heat pump inspection that includes cleaning and an annual tune-up. Schedule maintenance for your air conditioning system in the spring and your furnace or heat pump either late summer or early fall. That way, your unit is running optimally and efficiently as soon as you turn it on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your HVAC technician discovers a severe problem, they can deal with it before it leads to other problems, and before it&#8217;s time to switch over from heating to cooling or vice versa. A tune-up typically includes a thorough inspection including checking the heat exchanger for cracks, checking refrigeration, cleaning condensate tube build-up, condenser cleaning, lubricating all moving parts and replacing filters.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>DO: Change your filters regularly</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though your HVAC specialist is <a href=\"https://www.nachi.org/change-hvac-filter.htm\">checking filters</a> twice annually during maintenance and tune-ups, that doesn&#8217;t mean you shouldn&#8217;t check them. Typically, HVAC systems have either a 30-day fiberglass filter or a three-month pleated filter. Because they have such a short lifespan, you should check them regularly. Even if it&#8217;s ahead of schedule, change them if they&#8217;re dirty.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Leaving a dirty filter in an HVAC unit makes it work harder. The harder an HVAC unit has to work to circulate air throughout a home, the more energy it&#8217;s using. A dirty filter also strains the system&#8217;s fan, which can also make it work too hard.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>DO: Keep the area clutter-free for healthy systems</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Seasonal HVAC maintenance should also include keeping the area around HVAC units clear both indoors and outdoors. That means there should be no build-up of debris, dirt, grass or leaves. According to the <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/maintaining-your-air-conditioner\">Department of Energy</a>, you should leave at least two feet of space around outdoor HVAC units to ensure they operate efficiently.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>DO: Regulate your internal temperatures</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/thermostats\">Department of Energy</a> states that, when homeowners turn their thermostats back by 7 to 10 degrees for eight hours daily, they can save 10% on annual heating and cooling bills. Further, if you set your thermostat to 68 degrees in the winter when you&#8217;re awake and lower it when sleeping, that also saves on energy costs. Use that same strategy in the summer by setting thermostats at 78 degrees when at home and keeping it warmer when away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using programmable or <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/s?k=smart+thermostat&#38;crid=TG6I82TA4JOZ&#38;sprefix=smart+the%2Caps%2C177&#38;ref=nb_sb_ss_i_1_9\">smart thermostats</a> is a simple way to control your home&#8217;s heating and cooling efficiency. You can control this thermostat technology from a smartphone or tablet from any location. Some smart thermostats can even learn your habits, adapting so you don&#8217;t even have to program energy-saving adjustments.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>DO: Do visual inspections during your HVAC maintenance</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At least once a year, perform a visual inspection of your system to make sure nothing looks awry. Check that condensate or evaporator coils aren&#8217;t dirty, that coils are not frozen and there are no water leaks. Look for damage to fins and, when the unit is on, listen for strange vibrations or sounds. Contact an HVAC professional if you notice anything that needs addressing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>DO: Maintain your carbon monoxide detector</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When you&#8217;re operating an oil or natural gas heating system, you&#8217;ll also have a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/s?k=carbon+monoxide+detector&#38;crid=OE8Z8XKAE4W2&#38;sprefix=carbon+mon%2Caps%2C183&#38;ref=nb_sb_ss_i_1_10onoxide-alarms/\">carbon monoxide detector</a>. Make sure you&#8217;re testing the carbon monoxide detector at least once monthly. If the unit has replaceable batteries, change them at least once every six months or when you hear a single beep every minute. These detectors are essential for HVAC maintenance because, if it starts beeping four times with a pause, that means your HVAC unit is leaking, and you must get outside into fresh air and call 9-1-1 immediately. It&#8217;s also essential to remember that the average lifespan of a carbon monoxide detector is between five and seven years. Some monitors will notify you that they need replacement if they beep five times every minute.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>DO: Make a seasonal HVAC maintenance checklist</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Creating a <a href=\"https://www.energystar.gov/campaign/heating_cooling/maintenance_checklist\">seasonal HVAC maintenance checklist</a> gives you all the to-do&#8217;s to add to your calendar. You&#8217;ll want to add professional seasonal maintenance to the calendar, which will include turning the water on in the fall, replacing the humidifier wick, turning the water supply to the furnace off in the spring and inspecting air conditioner refrigerant lines before summer. Additional checklist items include checking thermostat settings, tightening electrical connections, lubricating all moving parts, inspecting the condensate drain and checking the system&#8217;s controls.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make sure your calendar has reminders to schedule this maintenance, change your air filters monthly (or every three months depending on the type), replacing batteries in your smoke alarms and carbon monoxide detectors and inspecting your system.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>DON&#8217;T: Ignore higher utility bills</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If your HVAC system doesn&#8217;t receive regular maintenance, that could mean it&#8217;s running less efficiently. As a result, it&#8217;s consuming more fuel and causing <a href=\"https://www.goodmanmfg.com/resources/hvac-learning-center/operation/why-is-my-utility-bill-increasing\">higher utility bills</a>. High energy bills indicate that the system either isn&#8217;t functioning as it should or that it might be time to replace it with a more energy-efficient unit. Look at the age of your HVAC system to determine if it&#8217;s time for an upgrade that meets <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=40232\">efficiency standards</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>DON&#8217;T: Be afraid to call in an HVAC professional</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While there are many things you can do to ensure that your HVAC system is running optimally from season to season, there are limitations. <a href=\"https://www.homedepot.com/services/c/hvac-repair/673dcc2c8\">HVAC specialists</a> are trained and must follow building codes to ensure your home is safe. They also manage all electrical component installation to ensure efficiency. A sign that you need to hire an HVAC professional includes your system continuously turning on and off, or <a href=\"https://energyair.com/air-conditioner-short-cycling/\">short-cycling</a>. You might also need an HVAC professional if there is excessive noise when you start up the system.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Frequently asked questions</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>When do I need to schedule professional HVAC maintenance?</strong><strong><br></strong>Schedule professional HVAC maintenance twice per year. Your air conditioning system should be checked in the spring and your furnace or heat pump in late summer or early fall.&#160;&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What temperature should I set my thermostat?</strong><strong><br></strong>The <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/thermostats\">Department of Energy</a> suggests setting thermostats to 68 degrees during the winter when you&#8217;re awake and lower for sleeping. In summer months, keep thermostats at 78 degrees when you&#8217;re home and set it to higher temperatures when you&#8217;re out, adapting it as needed for your health needs.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What does an HVAC tune-up include?</strong><strong><br></strong>Seasonal <a href=\"https://www.goodmanmfg.com/resources/hvac-learning-center/maintenance/seasonal-heating-and-air-conditioning-maintenance\">tune-ups</a> include a thorough inspection, checking the heat exchanger for cracks, checking refrigeration, cleaning condensate tube build-up, condenser cleaning, lubricating all moving parts and replacing filters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How long does an HVAC tune-up take?</strong><strong><br></strong>Depending on your HVAC system&#8217;s configuration, plan on tune-ups to last <a href=\"https://www.ars.com/blog/ars-rescue-rooter-time-for-a-tune-up\">about one hour</a>. Include an additional 30 to 45 minutes if any refrigerant is needed.<br></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://freshome.com/heating-and-cooling/hvac-maintenance-tips/\">HVAC Maintenance Tips</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://freshome.com\">Freshome.com</a>.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FreshInspirationForYourHome/~4/UZZvfP_hFIM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FreshInspirationForYourHome/~4/6CNFSuXigAk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FreshInspirationForYourHome/~4/eRTdk1ypwKM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FreshInspirationForYourHome/~4/aT1qN6NDKjQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FreshInspirationForYourHome/~4/ZaNVtT8Xbcs\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FreshInspirationForYourHome/~4/oLa_A5XxJz0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 27 May 2020 15:58:41 +0000","feedId":95,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"32d532c93d4cceab79a5cedaa1d6f039","metaImg":"","author":"Freshome Team","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FreshInspirationForYourHome/~4/UZZvfP_hFIM":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn14@2020_2/2020-07-30/1596128124660_ec825a993dbd85d9.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FreshInspirationForYourHome/~4/6CNFSuXigAk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn90@2020_1/2020-07-30/1596128124569_0f134c67462a4409.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FreshInspirationForYourHome/~4/eRTdk1ypwKM":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn18@2020_3/2020-07-30/1596128124548_0eda47f37316b1b3.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FreshInspirationForYourHome/~4/aT1qN6NDKjQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn66@2020_3/2020-07-30/1596128124567_932f1fde2d8f9091.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FreshInspirationForYourHome/~4/ZaNVtT8Xbcs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn22@2020_2/2020-07-30/1596128124590_f62c5787e4516a7d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FreshInspirationForYourHome/~4/oLa_A5XxJz0":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn70@2020_4/2020-07-30/1596128124533_e530b6dee4d0c04b.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-07-31 00:55:21","updatedTime":"2020-07-30 16:55:21","title":"Bed and Mattress Height","link":"https://freshome.com/?p=355588","description":"\n<p>Most people think about the size of the mattress when it comes to finding a new bed. But bed height and mattress height are often overlooked as factors that affect personal comfort, body health and the overall aesthetic of your sleep space. An amazing night’s sleep is quickly undone if you struggle to get out of bed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>How to determine the best bed height for you</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Why do you want to purchase a new bed?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Purchasing a new bed and mattress is no small investment. We spend <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21056174\">one-third of our lives sleeping (or trying to)</a>, so finding the right mattress affects our overall well-being. Make a list of what you love about your current mattress and what you don’t. Is it challenging getting into or out of bed? Do you and your partner not have enough room to stretch out comfortably? Take time to build the perfect bed by making an educated decision based on your sleeping position, firmness level and your bedroom’s decor.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What physical factors should be considered in bed height?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<h3>Consider your height versus the overall bed height to ensure a seamless sleep experience. If you&#8217;re petite, you shouldn’t need a step stool to climb into bed. Conversely, if you&#8217;re tall you don&#8217;t want to have to crouch awkwardly to get onto the mattress. Generally, a bed should hit around knee-level, or about two feet from the ground.&#160;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Age is another critical factor in choosing bed height. Aging adults may lose balance or fall from a too-high mattress height. A mattress height that is too low can cause painful pressure on joints. The proper bed height can help prevent injuries and strains.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What medical factors should be considered?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Medical factors such as fibromyalgia, degenerative disc disease and muscle pain play an important role in determining the best overall bed height. Think about the ability to get in and out of bed easily and without putting excessive strain on your body. Getting up from a low-height bed can cause unnecessary pressure and pain. Alternatively, if your feet can&#8217;t touch the floor while sitting on an 18-inch memory foam mattress on top of a 9-inch box spring, getting up from a higher bed can cause similar issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have physical issues or limitations that require a specific bed height, talk to your doctor for a recommendation and customize your mattress and bed frame accordingly.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What mattress size fits your needs spatially and aesthetically?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While a king size mattress offers plenty of sleep real estate, does it fit your bedroom space? Compare your overall room measurements to the bed measurements (mattress and frame included). Make sure you&#8217;ll be able to move easily around the bedroom and still have space for your furniture.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mattress size and bed height can also affect the aesthetics of a room. Traditional bed heights complement larger rooms with vaulted ceilings while low-profile mattresses give the appearance of more space.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Typical bed and mattress height</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When choosing your new mattress, consider the overall bed height including the bed foundation or box spring. The <a href=\"https://bettersleep.org/\">Better Sleep Council</a> shares, “while most people focus on the mattress for comfort, in reality, your foundation is responsible for much of your bed&#8217;s <a href=\"https://6abc.com/3320361/\">comfort and support</a>.”&#160;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some popular bed types and their typical heights:<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Futon bed height</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<h3>The futon of yesteryear has had a complete overhaul. Modern-day futons provide the multi-function of a sofa during the day and a sleeper at night. Upholstered in a variety of materials including leather, faux-leather and fabric, futons easily integrate into an apartment, guest bedroom or small space. The futon’s “mattress” portion is approximately 5 inches in height with an overall futon height of 15 inches off the floor, creating a low-profile, contemporary look. Selecting a futon doesn’t mean skimping on comfort. <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Serta-RNE-3S-CC-SET-Collection-Convertible-Charcoal/dp/B07KD6VRK3/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&#38;keywords=serta%2Bfuton&#38;qid=1587590619&#38;s=home-garden&#38;sr=1-1&#38;th=1\">Serta’s 15-inch Rane</a> futon contains high-density foam webbing cushions and pocket coils.</h3>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Adjustable bed height</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Smartphone apps and wireless remotes often control these tech-fueled adjustable bases. With features such as USB ports, under-bed lighting and adjustable legs, these bases provide the ultimate control over bed height and sleep position. From watching TV, reading a book or combating a night of snoring, power bases can be elevated or lowered. The adjustable legs come in three 3-inch pieces allowing customization of bed height based on your specific needs. Pair a 12-inch memory foam mattress by <a href=\"https://www.tempurpedic.com/shop-mattresses/tempur-proadapt/v/2594/\">Tempur-Pro Adapt</a> with their 9-inch <a href=\"https://www.tempurpedic.com/bases-and-foundations/\">adjustable power base</a> for a high-tech and ergonomic slumber. When choosing an adjustable base, always take into account the range of motion in addition to the bed height.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Platform bed height</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Platform beds provide a lower bed height as they are a flat foundation without the added height of a traditional box spring. Made up of a <a href=\"https://www.sleepfoundation.org/mattress-information/platform-bed-ideas\">solid flat material</a>, grouping of slats or a lattice-type grid, platform beds provide a stable surface on which your mattress can rest directly. Platform bed heights vary from 2-inch ultra-low profile to the standard 5-inch height. Platform beds go hand in hand with memory foam. For example, <a href=\"https://www.leesa.com/products/leesa-mattress\">Leesa details</a> that their memory foam mattresses are designed to rest on a flat, firm and sturdy surface. For a compact bed height, pair the <a href=\"https://www.leesa.com/products/leesa-mattress\">Leesa</a> 10-inch memory foam mattress with their <a href=\"https://www.leesa.com/products/leesa-foundation\">7.5 inch foundation</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Traditional bed height</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Traditional bed foundations are most commonly known as box springs. The <a href=\"https://www.serta.com/comfort-101/shopping-tips/do-i-need-a-box-spring\">standard box spring height</a> is 9 inches, with the option of a low-profile box spring at 5 to 5.5 inches in height. Keep in mind a standard box spring will add considerable overall bed height as opposed to platform beds. Before purchasing your new mattress and foundation, always thoroughly read the warranty. Case in point, if you use a box spring with a Purple mattress, the <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/360-reviews/mattress/purple-mattress\">warranty will be voided</a>, as a box spring does not properly support Purple’s foam and hybrid mattresses.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Trundle bed height</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Trundle beds provide extra sleeping space cleverly nestled under a larger bed. Typically on rollers, trundle beds can be easily moved when needed and hidden out of sight when not in use. Due to their compact size (most often a twin size mattress) and lack of a box spring, trundle beds are lower in height. A good option is the compact and comfortable <a href=\"https://myessentia.com/products/beausommet\">Essentia Wholebody Beausommet</a> 8-inch memory foam mattress. Note, however, sleepers who are tall, elderly or have back or joint pain should choose another location to rest their head due to the trundle’s low bed height and sizing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Pillow top bed height</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Foundations aren’t the only variable in bed height. Mattresses with a pillow top add extra height to your bed due to the additional layer of cushioning. Pillow top bed heights can range from 13 inches for the <a href=\"https://www.avocadogreenmattress.com/shop/avocado-mattress/?variant=twin&#38;pt=true\">Avocado Green</a> mattress with an attached pillow top to a sizable 18 inches for the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Beautyrest-Black-K-Class-Pillow-Mattress/dp/B07SK4TBSZ?th=1\">Beautyrest</a> Black K-Class pillow top. The extra padding within the pillow top can be composed of several different materials. Memory foam, cotton, latex, regular or polyurethane foam are popular pillow top fillers. Keep in mind the additional bed height when choosing your sheet set, as pillow top mattresses require deep pockets.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Should I choose a new bed based on height?&#160;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Basing a bed selection on height is more important than you might think, especially if you have health issues. You’ll have many choices of mattresses and beds based on height, mattress type, sleep position, firmness level and physical needs will ensure quality sleep and a sound investment. One way to test a potential bed height is to try sitting and getting up from various chair heights. Once you find the height that feels best, you can find a bed frame, box spring and mattress that together make the height you <br></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://freshome.com/bedroom/bed-and-mattress-height/\">Bed and Mattress Height</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://freshome.com\">Freshome.com</a>.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FreshInspirationForYourHome/~4/CmPgI3Yb9Gw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FreshInspirationForYourHome/~4/_WB0Fn4MFvQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FreshInspirationForYourHome/~4/3dkhdeqTVn8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FreshInspirationForYourHome/~4/aS2xMSGYuT8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FreshInspirationForYourHome/~4/FXLuWUic070\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FreshInspirationForYourHome/~4/MLSWa-fcVOs\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 27 May 2020 16:01:13 +0000","feedId":95,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"9162ae8e36df98f320d71ce2ecd83e68","metaImg":"","author":"Freshome Team","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FreshInspirationForYourHome/~4/CmPgI3Yb9Gw":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn34@2020_1/2020-07-30/1596128124532_bd97831fca56fc4a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FreshInspirationForYourHome/~4/_WB0Fn4MFvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn50@2020_2/2020-07-30/1596128124619_5dc9c48d0f1cb4ab.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FreshInspirationForYourHome/~4/3dkhdeqTVn8":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn82@2020_2/2020-07-30/1596128124537_c744cc0e0982a0f4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FreshInspirationForYourHome/~4/aS2xMSGYuT8":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn40@2020_6/2020-07-30/1596128124632_4403bf3dff370746.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FreshInspirationForYourHome/~4/FXLuWUic070":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn62@2020_5/2020-07-30/1596128124518_72723f9123605c4d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FreshInspirationForYourHome/~4/MLSWa-fcVOs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn26@2020_2/2020-07-30/1596128124589_57f96c4f41df320a.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-07-31 00:55:24","updatedTime":"2020-07-30 16:55:24","title":"Top Home Bathroom Flooring Options","link":"https://freshome.com/?p=355590","description":"\n<p>Choosing the most suitable bathroom flooring can be daunting. You want your bathroom flooring to complement the rest of the home yet still withstand high moisture levels, humidity and heavy foot traffic. The sheer number of bathroom floor designs, colors, textures and material types further complicate the process. To help cut through the clutter, we&#8217;ve narrowed down the best flooring for bathroom areas as well as the pros and cons of each.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Best waterproof bathroom flooring options</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many bathroom flooring options on the market today, with many of them claiming to be waterproof. But are they? Waterproof flooring means that no water or moisture will penetrate it no matter how long the floor is exposed. In genuinely waterproof flooring materials, the waterproofing product is baked in rather than just being used as a coating. By contrast, water-resistant floors are usually not resistant to moisture under the top layer of the floor.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the flooring material may be waterproof, the subfloor is usually not. As such, water can seep through cracks, between floorboards or along the wall and cause damage to the bathroom’s structure. Bathrooms often need a silicone sealant around bathtubs and toilets no matter what flooring type you choose.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Waterproof bathroom flooring is easier to clean and maintain, but it also protects. Because water will always find its way down through cracks on the floor or in walls, this leakage can manifest itself in the form of damp ceilings or walls, especially if the bathroom is on an upper floor. As waterproof flooring is watertight, there&#8217;s little risk of leakage.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Waterproof vinyl flooring</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Gone are the days when vinyl was perceived as flimsy or cheap. Today it is one of the most popular flooring options for its durability and comfort. <a href=\"https://freshome.com/flooring/laminate-vs-vinyl-flooring/\">Vinyl planks and tiles</a> come in virtually any color and style imaginable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Waterproof vinyl flooring’s core is reinforced by additional layers to enhance its rigidity. When shopping for waterproof vinyl flooring with rigid core construction, you are likely to come across <a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/treesearch/pubs/36662\">wood plastic composite (WPC)</a> and <a href=\"https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/stone-plastic-composite-flooring-market\">stone plastic composite (SPC)</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the name suggests, WPC incorporates fine sawdust or other wood-like materials, a thermoplastic resin, fiber and a foaming agent. Sometimes referred to as wood polymer composite, this type of flooring material is lightweight, resilient, warm and comfortable when you are standing for long periods.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>SPC vinyl flooring material uses ground limestone, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and stabilizers. SPC is thinner, denser and heavier compared to WPC flooring. Due to its thin nature, there&#8217;s little padding underfoot, which makes it less comfortable.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Types of waterproof vinyl flooring for bathrooms</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Waterproof vinyl plank</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Waterproof vinyl planks are perhaps the most popular WPC vinyl flooring option on the market today.

Both are made from a clay mixture that&#8217;s heated in a kiln. However, porcelain flooring is made of refined clay and is heated at higher temperatures making it denser and <a href=\"https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/news/2015/01/the-best-tile-for-floors-counters-and-backsplashes/index.htm\">more durable than ceramic</a>.

Porcelain tiles are harder, denser, tougher and less porous. On the downside, they are more expensive than ceramic tiles. Ceramic tiles are more affordable because they <a href=\"https://worldwidescience.org/topicpages/c/ceramic+tile+industry.html\">are less refined</a>, but are also <a href=\"https://www.qualicer.org/recopilatorio/ponencias/pdfs/9203011e.pdf\">less durable</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Thin-gauged floor tiles</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gauged porcelain tiles (GPT) measure 36-by-36 inches or smaller.

Ceramic tiles have the same benefits as porcelain tiles but are more affordable. Vinyl is the most affordable option for a high-use bathroom.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What are the best cheap flooring ideas?</strong><strong><br></strong>Laminate and vinyl are both affordable flooring options for a bathroom. Both come in various styles, designs and colors and are two of the more easily installed flooring types.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What are some small bathroom tile ideas?</strong><strong><br></strong>A small bathroom should have small- or medium-sized tiles in neutral colors. It is not a good idea to install large tiles in small bathrooms. Apart from disrupting proportionality, large tiles may need to be cut off, resulting in waste, which can also interrupt any patterns.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What are the best bathroom flooring ideas for households with kids?</strong><strong><br></strong>Porcelain and ceramic flooring is great in a kid’s bathroom. These tiles are scratch-, stain- and water-resistant. They are also more durable than bathroom vinyl flooring and can withstand splashes from exuberant playing in tubs and sinks.<br></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://freshome.com/flooring/top-home-bathroom-flooring-options/\">Top Home Bathroom Flooring Options</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://freshome.com\">Freshome.com</a>.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FreshInspirationForYourHome/~4/xbpRiAHrGaQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FreshInspirationForYourHome/~4/sZ-gCZuChsg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FreshInspirationForYourHome/~4/C84Qp3wZmWA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FreshInspirationForYourHome/~4/5uaPUnKV1lA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FreshInspirationForYourHome/~4/vyOIfzSB4Lk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FreshInspirationForYourHome/~4/ShyxiWYprtc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 27 May 2020 16:05:46 +0000","feedId":95,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"5c72e817e992d1d02570ccb8f8ecc9d4","metaImg":"","author":"Freshome Team","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FreshInspirationForYourHome/~4/xbpRiAHrGaQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn74@2020_1/2020-07-30/1596128124542_d1b7d35d08da4157.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FreshInspirationForYourHome/~4/sZ-gCZuChsg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn6@2020_3/2020-07-30/1596128124650_238ac2d2bbbd24e2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FreshInspirationForYourHome/~4/C84Qp3wZmWA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn14@2020_4/2020-07-30/1596128124517_c264bb1f8fca9f5b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FreshInspirationForYourHome/~4/5uaPUnKV1lA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn22@2020_3/2020-07-30/1596128124550_1ff500e3d484e2a3.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FreshInspirationForYourHome/~4/vyOIfzSB4Lk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn10@2020_2/2020-07-30/1596128243995_c53ca290924895b1.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FreshInspirationForYourHome/~4/ShyxiWYprtc":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn26@2020_1/2020-07-30/1596128124535_d2221387434141ec.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-07-31 00:55:24","updatedTime":"2020-07-30 16:55:24","title":"Best Memory Foam Mattress","link":"https://freshome.com/?p=355593","description":"\n<p>Expertly crafted to adapt and conform to your body, the best memory foam mattresses deliver customized support and comfort.

Internet technology continues to evolve and new players are always entering the market. Therefore, the best deal you could find five years ago may not be right for you today. Also, many internet providers offer limited-time reduced pricing, which can cause your bill to increase significantly after the promotional period ends. It’s worth periodically checking your options to determine whether it’s time to switch internet providers (ISPs). We will help you evaluate what you need in an internet package and explain how to switch internet providers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Determine your internet needs</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The first step in determining your internet needs is choosing which types of internet can best meet those needs. Although more speed is always fun to have, the <a href=\"https://freshome.com/broadband/internet-speed-test/\">speeds you need</a> will depend largely on how you use the internet:</p>\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Casual browsing and social media:</strong> Casual web browsing and social media don’t require a lot of speed. Anything up to 25 Mbps should be enough, with the higher end of the range giving you some wiggle room to stream a movie now and then.</li><li><strong>HD video streaming:</strong> Technically, you need about 5 Mbps for HD streaming and 25 Mbps for 4K streaming through Netflix and <a href=\"https://www.fcc.gov/research-reports/guides/broadband-service-home-consumers-guide\">about twice that</a> for YouTube. In reality, though, these services tend to buffer (preload video) at much higher speeds. If you can, go for a connection that’s at least 50 to 100 Mbps.</li><li><strong>Online gaming:</strong> Gaming only requires speeds of 3 to 6 Mbps, depending on game specifications, but lag can be a problem. For the smoothest gameplay, online gamers should connect at 50 to 100 Mbps or more.</li><li><strong>Homes with just a few devices:</strong> The above recommendations apply to one or two devices connecting simultaneously. If you have a small household, follow the suggestions above.</li><li><strong>Homes with many connected devices:</strong> If you have an internet-connected smart home, or your family has a lot of devices, go for a faster connection. For example, the HD streaming speeds detailed above are <em>per device</em>. If your family watches different movies in different parts of the house, each connection needs plenty of speed. Choose a connection that’s at least 150 to 200 Mbps.</li></ul>\n\n\n<p>As you might expect, different types of internet cater to different needs:</p>\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Fiber-optic: </strong><a href=\"https://freshome.com/broadband/fiber-internet/internet.htm\">Fiber-optic internet</a> carries data on light signals along fibers bundled together in cables. It offers speeds of up to 1,000 Mbps (1 Gbps) for both downloading and uploading and is a popular choice for those with smart homes and those interested in future-proofing their internet connection. However, it’s not yet available in many markets as of early 2020.</li><li><strong>Cable:</strong> Cable internet <a href=\"https://freshome.com/broadband/cable-vs-dsl/\">connects to the same network</a> as cable TV, using space on designated channels. Average cable download speeds are <a href=\"https://freshome.com/broadband/cable-vs-dsl/\">up to 200 Mbps</a>, and many companies now offer speeds of 1,000 Mbps. Unlike fiber, though, upload speeds are slower than download speeds due to providers prioritizing the activities we do most online. Cable internet is widely available across the United States, except in very rural areas.</li><li><strong>DSL:</strong> Short for digital subscriber line, <a href=\"https://freshome.com/broadband/dsl-internet/\">DSL internet</a> uses the extra bandwidth on your traditional home phone line. It doesn’t take over the entire line, but service quality varies depending on how far you are from the closest access point. Download speeds of up to 100 Mbps are available in some areas, though speeds under 10 Mbps are more typical, especially in rural areas. DSL can be a very cost-effective choice, especially if you already have a landline home phone.</li><li><strong>Satellite:</strong> If you live in a very remote area, satellite internet may be your only option. There are only two satellite internet providers in the United States: <a href=\"https://www.allconnect.com/providers/hughesnet\">HughesNet</a> and <a href=\"https://www.allconnect.com/providers/viasat\">Viasat</a>. Speeds are limited (about 25 Mbps with HughesNet and 30 Mbps with Viasat) and the service is relatively pricey.</li></ul>\n\n\n<h2><strong>What to expect when switching internet providers</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Switching internet providers is not always straightforward. You may need to pay a contract buyout fee, though some providers will <a href=\"https://www.spectrum.com/policies/contract-buyout\">pay off your old contract</a> when you switch to their service. You may find that your current provider suddenly offers you a better deal when you call to cancel service. Your favorite internet provider may not offer service in your area, or you may lose bundling discounts if you don’t also change your TV and phone services.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>How to switch internet providers step by step</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, it’s possible to switch internet providers by taking a step-by-step approach:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 1: Research new providers</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first step is to learn which internet providers offer service in your area. You can use this <a href=\"https://www.allconnect.com/internet/in-my-area\">zip code search tool</a> to narrow down your search to providers in your neighborhood. Research available plans to determine which ones might fit your needs and budget. You might wonder, “Can I switch internet providers mid-contract?” If this is a concern for you, look for a new provider that will buy out your existing contract.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 2: Call your current internet provider to inquire about deals</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you sign up with a new provider, call your existing internet provider. Companies prefer not to lose customers, so they may offer you a good deal to stay. If your current service is acceptable, it’s worth comparing the offer to those you found from other providers to see if it makes sense to stick with your existing ISP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 3: Overlap your services</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re wondering how to switch internet providers without losing internet, the solution is to overlap your services. Don’t turn off your current service until your new service is installed and working properly. You will end up paying for a few days of both services, but it may be worth it to avoid losing your internet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 4: Choose your installation</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on the type of internet service you choose and whether your home has existing lines, you may be able to install your new internet yourself or you may need professional installation. Your sales representative should be able to help you decide which type of installation is right for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 5: Test your new connection</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a professional installer come to your home, they will make sure the connection is working properly. If you install your own equipment, take the time to check out a few websites and maybe stream a TV show to make sure there are no problems with the connection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 6: Return your old equipment</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>When your new connection is running properly, cancel your former service and return all equipment that belongs to that provider as soon as possible to avoid fees.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Frequently asked questions</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Should I switch internet providers?</strong>&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Only you can decide whether switching internet providers is right for you. However, with technology evolving rapidly and new companies continually entering the market, it only makes sense to review your options every year or two to see if there is a better choice. You&#8217;ll also want to consider switching if you need faster speeds or feel you&#8217;re paying for internet speeds you don&#8217;t need.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Can I switch internet providers mid-contract?</strong>&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can always switch internet providers mid-contract, but there may be a contract cancellation fee. If you are concerned about this, choose a new provider that is willing to pay off your old contract. If you can&#8217;t find one who will buy out your contract, it may still be worthwhile to switch if you&#8217;ll save money in the long term.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How can I switch internet providers without losing internet?</strong>&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best way to switch internet providers without losing internet is to overlap your services by a few days. Though you will have to pay for those days, it allows you to get your new service up and running before your previous service is disconnected.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Which type of internet should I choose?</strong>&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which type of internet to choose depends on your budget, geographic location and internet needs. Fiber-optic and cable internet are the fastest, and cable is widely available. DSL and satellite may be the only options in more rural areas. DSL is generally inexpensive, but the signal degrades the further you are from an access point. Satellite is reliable but pricey. Consider all factors when making your decision.<br></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://freshome.com/broadband/switching-internet-providers/\">Switching Internet Providers</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://freshome.com\">Freshome.com</a>.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FreshInspirationForYourHome/~4/96TkCgyDjy8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FreshInspirationForYourHome/~4/5tYW5OmIp2o\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FreshInspirationForYourHome/~4/4UuZgkFlifE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FreshInspirationForYourHome/~4/CAXg7SOhpNo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FreshInspirationForYourHome/~4/ftDeUAtxFKo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FreshInspirationForYourHome/~4/RUv3o35o42E\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 27 May 2020 16:14:49 +0000","feedId":95,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"0026a9853beaea88fb6a05f62e35a4aa","metaImg":"","author":"Freshome Team","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FreshInspirationForYourHome/~4/96TkCgyDjy8":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn46@2020_5/2020-07-30/1596128133932_dc0a923d81e80d70.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FreshInspirationForYourHome/~4/5tYW5OmIp2o":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn18@2020_3/2020-07-30/1596128124552_9654305b90b8e2a0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FreshInspirationForYourHome/~4/4UuZgkFlifE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn100@2020_2/2020-07-30/1596128124650_5838fc3ab927a9e9.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FreshInspirationForYourHome/~4/CAXg7SOhpNo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn30@2020_2/2020-07-30/1596128124558_56a20fd07cf15411.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FreshInspirationForYourHome/~4/ftDeUAtxFKo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn78@2020_2/2020-07-30/1596128124549_f8781f64f76c1fc9.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FreshInspirationForYourHome/~4/RUv3o35o42E":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn58@2020_1/2020-07-30/1596128124601_0948af48951c5fe3.webp"}}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-07-31 00:55:24","updatedTime":"2020-07-30 16:55:24","feedId":95,"fetchDate":"Thu, 30 Jul 2020 16:55:24 +0000","fetchMs":26,"handleMs":3116,"totalMs":123593,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":5,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"52.21.209.244","hostName":"ancient-stream-41040.herokuapp.com","requestId":"4c6b74f43f4c407a8f06075fbd3eed24_95","bgimgsTotal":0,"bgimgsGithubTotal":0,"articlesImgsTotal":30,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":30},"extra4":{"start":1596128121280,"total":0,"statList":[{"spend":31,"msg":"获取xml内容"},{"spend":3116,"msg":"解释文章"},{"spend":2,"msg":"上传封面图到cdn"},{"spend":1,"msg":"修正封面图上传失败重新上传"},{"spend":120381,"msg":"正文链接上传到cdn"}]},"extra5":30,"extra6":30,"extra7ImgCdnFailResultVector":[null]}
