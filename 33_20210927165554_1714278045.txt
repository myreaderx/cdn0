Smallpox once killed 30% of the people who contracted the disease but through the invention of an effective, safe vaccine and an intense effort that began in the 1960s, <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/smallpox-is-the-only-human-disease-to-be-eradicated-heres-how-the-world-achieved-it\">smallpox was completely eradicated by 1980</a>. In the 1980s, scientists discovered a hole in the ozone layer that protects the Earth from UV radiation; further depletion would have caused major problems with the world’s food supply and an epidemic of skin cancer. Forty years later, we’ve virtually eliminated the chemicals causing the depletion and ozone losses have stabilized and <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/ozone-layer\">have recently shown improvement</a>.</p> \n<p>So how did we do it?

Her early fusion of gospel, the blues, and the electric guitar (as on 1944’s <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/track/0uUBfmp0ulkpf6EJzsZJZl?si=c19da142ce4a4a15\">Strange Things Happening Every Day</a>, a contender for the first rock &amp; roll record) had a huge influence on men like Little Richard, Chuck Berry, and Elvis Presley, who ended up winning much of the credit for this innovation. This 60-minute BBC documentary from 2011 is a good place to start learning about Tharpe — part 1 is embedded above and here are parts <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvmFcq5OF-k\">two</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wd9G7qHNv_k\">three</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2HlpDEg9F4\">four</a>.</p> \n<p>I found this <a href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2021/08/the-life-music-of-the-godmother-of-rock-and-roll-sister-rosetta-tharpe.html\">via Ted Mills at Open Culture</a>, who writes:</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>As the doc makes clear, Tharpe had a rebellious streak, didn’t do what she was told, and pushed boundaries in a very segregated America. She invited the all-white Jordanaires to tour with her, surprising house managers and booking agents alike. And she carried on a love affair and creative partnership with fellow gospel singer Marie Knight for decades, very much on the down low.</p> \n <p>So perhaps this is the reason Tharpe has not been on our collective radar — we’ve been slow to admit that rock guitar was created by a queer black woman devoted to the Lord.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>And if you want to see the whole clip of Tharpe performing Didn’t It Rain from the opening scene of the documentary, there’s really not a better way to spend eight minutes (bc you’ll probably want to watch it twice):</p> \n<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5SoZG4yDaJA\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p> \n<p>Damn.</p> \n<strong>Tags:</strong> \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/music\">music</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Rosetta%20Tharpe\">Rosetta Tharpe</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/video\">video</a>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 20 Sep 2021 17:33:33 +0000","feedId":33,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"03a95624cf5a789cf6a9ee5318b6123c","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Jason Kottke","publishedOrCreatedDate":1632761730041},{"createdTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:30","updatedTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:30","title":"The Most Difficult Shot in Movie History (And Why It Matters)","link":"https://kottke.org/21/09/most-difficult-shot-in-movie-history","description":"<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5POb5fQ4BYM\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p> \n<p>I don’t know if a 10-second sequence of a plane landing in one of Brian De Palma’s worst films properly qualifies as “The Most Difficult Shot in Movie History”, but the story behind it is genuinely interesting. The logistics of having only 30 seconds out of an entire year to get this exact shot of the setting sun <em>and</em> coordinating that with a landing supersonic jet at one of the world’s busiest airports are certainly daunting. As Patrick Willems notes in his commentary, this shot also signifies the end of an era in the film industry.</p> \n<strong>Tags:</strong> \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Brian%20De%20Palma\">Brian De Palma</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/film%20school\">film school</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/movies\">movies</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Patrick%20Willems\">Patrick Willems</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/video\">video</a>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 24 Sep 2021 17:13:03 +0000","feedId":33,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"f621ba864e7416f3bd15ab3311c53321","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Jason Kottke","publishedOrCreatedDate":1632761730603},{"createdTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:30","updatedTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:30","title":"One Complaint Per Table","link":"https://kottke.org/21/09/one-complaint-per-table","description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.lauraolin.com/\">Laura Olin</a> is right; <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2013/06/orson-welles-lunch-with-henry-jaglom.html\">this recorded lunch conversation with Orson Welles from 1983</a> is well worth a read. I mean:</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>Waiter: Gentlemen, bon appétit. How is everything?</p> \n <p>O.W.: We’re talking, thank you. [Waiter leaves.] I wish they wouldn’t do that. If I ever own a restaurant, I will never allow the waiters to ask if the diners like their dishes. Particularly when they’re talking.</p> \n <p>H.J.: What is wrong with your food?</p> \n <p>O.W.: It’s not what I had yesterday.</p> \n <p>H.J.: You want to try to explain this to the waiter?</p> \n <p>O.W.: No, no, no. One complaint per table is all, unless you want them to spit in the food. Let me tell you a story about George Jean Nathan, America’s great drama critic. Nathan was the tightest man who ever lived, even tighter than Charles Chaplin. And he lived for 40 years in the Hotel Royalton, which is across from the Algonquin. He never tipped anybody in the Royalton, not even when they brought the breakfast, and not at Christmastime. After about ten years of never getting tipped, the room-service waiter peed slightly in his tea. Everybody in New York knew it but him. The waiters hurried across the street and told the waiters at Algonquin, who were waiting to see when it would finally dawn on him what he was drinking! And as the years went by, there got to be more and more urine and less and less tea. And it was a great pleasure for us in the theater to look at a leading critic and know that he was full of piss. And I, with my own ears, heard him at the ‘21’ complaining, saying, “Why can’t I get tea here as good as it is at the Royalton?” That’s when I fell on the floor, you know.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>And this bit, about how people used to treat going to the movies like reading a magazine or flipping on the TV, is fascinating:</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>H.J.: Warren Beatty was just saying that TV has changed movies, because for most of us, once you’re in a movie theater, you commit, whether you like it or not. You want to see what they’ve done, while at home …</p> \n <p>O.W.: I’m the opposite. It’s a question of age. In my real moviegoing days, which were the thirties, you didn’t stand in line. You strolled down the street and sallied into the theater at any hour of the day or night. Like you’d go in to have a drink at a bar. Every movie theater was partially empty. We never asked what time the movie began. We used to go after we went to the theater.</p> \n <p>H.J.: You didn’t feel you had to see a movie from the start?</p> \n <p>O.W.: No. We’d leave when we’d realize, “This is where we came in.” Everybody said that. I loved movies for that reason. They didn’t cost that much, so if you didn’t like one, it was, “Let’s do something else. Go to another movie.” And that’s what made it habitual to such an extent that walking out of a movie was what for people now is like turning off the television set.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<strong>Tags:</strong> \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/movies\">movies</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Orson%20Welles\">Orson Welles</a>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 24 Sep 2021 19:37:21 +0000","feedId":33,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"cdae5c9da2668707dcadec421c66f4e1","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Jason Kottke","publishedOrCreatedDate":1632761730592},{"createdTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:30","updatedTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:30","title":"The Winners of the 2021 Drone Photo Awards","link":"https://kottke.org/21/09/the-winners-of-the-2021-drone-photo-awards","description":"<p><img src=\"https://kottke.org/plus/misc/images/drone-award-2021-01.jpg\" width=\"1300\" height=\"865\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Drone Award 2021 01\" /></p> \n<p><img src=\"https://kottke.org/plus/misc/images/drone-award-2021-02.jpg\" width=\"1300\" height=\"803\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Drone Award 2021 02\" /></p> \n<p><img src=\"https://kottke.org/plus/misc/images/drone-award-2021-03.jpg\" width=\"1300\" height=\"909\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Drone Award 2021 03\" /></p> \n<p><img src=\"https://kottke.org/plus/misc/images/drone-award-2021-04.jpg\" width=\"1300\" height=\"730\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Drone Award 2021 04\" /></p> \n<p><img src=\"https://kottke.org/plus/misc/images/drone-award-2021-05.jpg\" width=\"1300\" height=\"866\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Drone Award 2021 05\" /></p> \n<p>Drones have been around for awhile now, but I have yet to tire of the bird’s-eye images captured from above this remarkable planet of ours. <a href=\"https://droneawards.photo/gallery/2021\">The gallery of the winning images in the 2021 Drone Photo Awards</a> is full of tiny doses of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overview_effect\">the overview effect</a>.

One of their projects was to wrap a public building. When he arrived in Paris, Christo rented a small room near the Arc de Triomphe and had been attracted by the monument ever since. In 1962, he made a photomontage of the Arc de Triomphe wrapped, seen from the Avenue Foch and, in 1988, a collage. 60 years later, the project will finally be concretized.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>Jeanne-Claude died in 2009 and Christo followed in 2020, so the project was completed by their team according to their wishes.

McCarthy explained where all those colors come from:</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>Back to this image, this was captured through a telescope and involved capturing thousands of frames to reveal the details. But what about the colors? The moon is gray, of course, but not *perfectly* gray. Some areas have a subtle blue tint, and others have a more orange tint. By teasing out those subtle colors, I can reveal the mineral composition of the moon! Blues denote titanium presence, while orange shows iron and feldspar present in the regolith. You can also see how impacts paint the surface with fresh color in the ejecta as they churn up material.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p><a href=\"https://cosmicbackground.io/products/a-colorful-harvest-1\">A print is available</a>, but only for a very limited time (~6 more hours as of pub time).</p> \n<strong>Tags:</strong> \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Andrew%20McCarthy\">Andrew McCarthy</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/astronomy\">astronomy</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Moon\">Moon</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/photography\">photography</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/space\">space</a>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 21 Sep 2021 13:10:53 +0000","feedId":33,"bgimg":"https://kottke.org/plus/misc/images/full-harvest-moon.jpg","linkMd5":"5a7190d20379ea5672045086f6d7ba11","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn20@2020_6/2021/09/27/16-55-35-470_95ac30bb984dc4e1.webp","destWidth":1000,"destHeight":1000,"sourceBytes":212332,"destBytes":71376,"author":"Jason Kottke","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://kottke.org/plus/misc/images/full-harvest-moon.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn20@2020_6/2021/09/27/16-55-35-470_95ac30bb984dc4e1.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1632761730595},{"createdTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:30","updatedTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:30","title":"The Avocado Test","link":"https://kottke.org/21/09/the-avocado-test","description":"<p><img src=\"https://kottke.org/plus/misc/images/avocado-test.jpg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" border=\"0\" alt=\"the avocado test\" /></p> \n<p>That’s <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CTyND2osz-8/\">Meredith Southard’s cartoon</a> for the New Yorker, a play on <a href=\"https://kottke.org/18/06/willpower-wealth-and-the-marshmallow-test\">the marshmallow test</a>.

His long-time producer Lydia Tenaglia saw this too…she cold-called him after reading the book and <a href=\"https://explorepartsunknown.com/southern-italy/a-qa-with-zpzs-lydia-tenaglia-collins/\">pitched him on doing a TV show called A Cook’s Tour</a>, where the intrepid Bourdain would travel to different locations around the world to experience the food culture there.</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>I met him at a point in his life where he had never really traveled before. He had written a book, Kitchen Confidential, and I had read somewhere that he was going to try to write a follow-up book called A Cook’s Tour. I approached him — I kind of cold-called him — and I said, “Listen, I work in television.” And at that point I was freelancing for other companies as a producer and a shooter and an editor. I called Tony, and he was still working in a kitchen at the time, and I said, “Would you mind if me and my husband, Chris, came and shot a short demo and we try to sort of pitch the idea of A Cook’s Tour — meaning you traveling the world, kind of exploring the way other people eat — as a television series?” And he was like, “Yeah, sure. Whatever.” I don’t think he had any expectations at that point. Again, he hadn’t really traveled.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>A Cook’s Tour intrigued the folks at the Food Network and the show ended up running for 35 episodes over two seasons. And <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpz7cLJ1_TwSLBsCZiO1b_O4YnlHAJiB2\">they are now all available to watch for free on YouTube</a>. I’ve embedded the first episode above, where he goes (back) to Tokyo, but he also visits Vietnam, San Sebastian, Oaxaca, Scotland, Singapore, and Brazil during the show’s run. More from Tenaglia on how the show came about:</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>So that was the start of our relationship and our time together. We, fortunately, were able to pitch and sell that idea, A Cook’s Tour, to the Food Network. Me and Chris, my husband, and Tony, just the three of us, all went out on the road together for that first year, and we shot 23 episodes of A Cook’s Tour, and we kind of figured out the format of the show on the road. It was really Tony tapping into the references he did have — you know, films and books and things he had seen and knew about only through film and reading.</p> \n <p>So he was able to bring all of those cultural references to the table, and the three of us together were able to kind of play with the format of what those visuals would look like, so that it wasn’t just about him eating food at a restaurant. It was really about everything that was happening around him — or the thoughts he was having internally as he had these experiences or the references that he had seen through film that he loved and books that he had read, like The Quiet American, and how those things related to what he was experiencing.</p> \n <p>So it became this kind of sort of moving, evolving format that was very much based on, predicated on the location that we were in and those references that he could call up. The show just kind of began to take shape. I mean, really there was no format of the show going into it. We just said, “Hey, we’re going to travel around the world, and this guy … he’s a chef, and he’s written this great book, and he’s going to try food in other countries.” And that’s what sold the project to the Food Network at the time. Then, as we went and actually made the show, we really started to play with the format and turned it into something else.</p> \n <p>I would say that 17 years later the show has gone through various iterations. We did the two seasons of A Cook’s Tour on the Food Network, and then we did eight seasons of No Reservations on the Travel Channel, and now we’re on Parts Unknown. And the show has evolved as Tony has evolved, as the crew has evolved, as the technology has evolved. The show has sort of turned into this kind of, you know, one man’s initial foray into the world, and I think today, 17 years later, he’s really kind of evolved into more of a cultural anthropologist.</p> \n <p>The show’s very sociopolitical — it’s about people and characters. The food and the people are just the entry point. It’s really about all the context around it. The more you can bring story to that and the more you can bring references to that — film references … character references — the more you can introduce interesting, unique characters into the equation, I think that’s what keeps the show very fresh and why it’s continuing to evolve all these years later. Each show is very different from the one before it.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>It’s fun to watch the prototype of what eventually became a very beloved and different show.

In pursuing depth, humans must train their lungs and brains to unlock secret sources of clarity and strength and oxygen and potential that are hidden within the body. They are secrets that, once revealed, make the divers not just more effective at their craft, they argue, but more effective, conscious, skillful, and thoughtful as human beings. There is a shift in perspective. A global realignment within one’s consciousness. The look in their eyes when they talk about this thing…every diver who’s gone truly deep sounds like those rarest of individuals who’ve seen the earth from the moon, or died and been resuscitated.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>Alexey learned how to excel in the sport of freediving from his mother Natalia Molchanova:</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>When Alexey was younger, his mother, Natalia Molchanova, was the world’s best freediver, a distinction that she held for many years. She was a pioneer in the sport and the practitioner of a mind-and-body-control technique called “attention deconcentration.” She passed her secrets to her son, who perfected them and uses the regimen to reach a state of intense calm. By doing so, he can slow his heart rate, his metabolic rate, while simultaneously slowing the activity of his brain and his body. His focus deepens. He relaxes to the point of seeming asleep. He takes deep, drowsy breaths, like a summer breeze filling a sail.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>I <a href=\"https://kottke.org/09/08/attention-deconcentration\">first learned</a> about freediving from <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/08/24/the-deepest-dive\">Alec Wilkinson’s 2009 piece in the New Yorker</a>, where Natalia explained attention deconcentration:</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>To still the unbidden apprehensions that might interfere with her dive - what she describes as “the subjective feeling of empty lungs at the deep” — Molchanova uses a technique that she refers to as “attention deconcentration.” (“They get it from the military,” Ericson said.) Molchanova told me, “It means distribution of the whole field of attention — you try to feel everything simultaneously. This condition creates an empty consciousness, so the bad thoughts don’t exist.”</p> \n <p>“Is it difficult to learn?”</p> \n <p>“Yes, it’s difficult. I teach it in my university. It’s a technique from ancient warriors — it was used by samurai — but it was developed by a Russian scientist, Oleg Bakhtiyarov, as a psychological-state-management technique for people sho do very monotonous jobs.”</p> \n <p>I asked if it was like meditation.</p> \n <p>“To some degree, except meditation means you’re completely free, but if you’re in the sea at depth you will have to be focussed, or it will get bad. What you do to start learning is you focus on the edges, not the center of things, as if you were looking at a screen. Basically, all the time I am diving, I have an empty consciousness. I have a kind of melody going through my mind that keeps me going, but otherwise I am completely not in my mind.”</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>After reading both of these great pieces, you can check out one of Molchanov’s recent world record dives:</p> \n<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4B2H9Fz5xyY\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p> \n<strong>Tags:</strong> \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Alexey%20Molchanov\">Alexey Molchanov</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Daniel%20Riley\">Daniel Riley</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/free%20diving\">free diving</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Natalia%20Molchanova\">Natalia Molchanova</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/sports\">sports</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/video\">video</a>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 22 Sep 2021 14:09:32 +0000","feedId":33,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"58110ca39a0c02006a97845116b472f6","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Jason Kottke","publishedOrCreatedDate":1632761730608},{"createdTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:30","updatedTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:30","title":"Today Is September 21st","link":"https://kottke.org/21/09/today-is-september-21st","description":"<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qfi9JpgMc2U\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p> \n<p>Every year for the past several years on September 21, Demi Adejuyigbe makes a video featuring the 1978 Earth, Wind &amp; Fire song September (which begins “Do you remember, twenty-first night of September?”) This year, for what he says is his final effort, Adejuyigbe made a whole-ass movie, complete with special effects.

It shut down about 80 percent of the abortion services we provide. Anyone who suspects I have violated the new law can sue me for at least $10,000. They could also sue anybody who helps a person obtain an abortion past the new limit, including, apparently, the driver who brings a patient to my clinic.</p> \n <p>For me, it is 1972 all over again.</p> \n <p>And that is why, on the morning of Sept. 6, I provided an abortion to a woman who, though still in her first trimester, was beyond the state’s new limit. I acted because I had a duty of care to this patient, as I do for all patients, and because she has a fundamental right to receive this care.</p> \n <p>I fully understood that there could be legal consequences — but I wanted to make sure that Texas didn’t get away with its bid to prevent this blatantly unconstitutional law from being tested.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>Braid concluded his piece: “I believe abortion is an essential part of health care.” Absolutely.</p> \n<strong>Tags:</strong> \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/abortion\">abortion</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Alan%20Braid\">Alan Braid</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/medicine\">medicine</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/politics\">politics</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Texas\">Texas</a>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 20 Sep 2021 13:15:53 +0000","feedId":33,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"a287dad6413fcc602cebd29344ec4fff","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Jason Kottke","publishedOrCreatedDate":1632761730040},{"createdTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:30","updatedTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:30","title":"The Tragedy of Macbeth","link":"https://kottke.org/21/09/the-tragedy-of-macbeth","description":"<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/HM3hsVrBMA4\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p> \n<p>Welp, from the small glimpses we get in this trailer, Joel Coen’s The Tragedy of Macbeth, starring Denzel Washington and Frances McDormand, looks pretty fantastic.

Reliant on sustainable energy and natural commodities, Steger formed a community and culture based on the principle of mutuality. Central to Steger’s operation is the lost art of cutting ice for refrigeration. This annual harvest formed a tradition spanning fifty years that became known as the “Ice Ball”.

In <a href=\"https://bigthink.com/the-present/peak-car/\">this excerpt</a>, he argues that the world has reached “peak car” — “the point at which car ownership and use level off and start to decline”.</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>Evidence for peak car in Western countries, meanwhile, has been accumulating for some time. In America, the total number of vehicle miles traveled has continued to increase. But it has been growing more slowly than both the total number of vehicles and the population. The number of miles driven per vehicle, and per person of driving age, both peaked in 2004 and have since fallen to levels last seen in the 1990s. The average distance driven per person per year peaked in the 2000s or earlier in many Western cities including London, Stockholm, Vienna, Houston, and Atlanta. In Australia, Belgium, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, and Spain, distance traveled per person has been flat or falling since the early 2000s (in Britain, the average motorist drove seventy-six hundred miles in 2018, down from ninety-two hundred in 2002). Miles traveled by car per annum per capita in Italy, Britain, the Netherlands, and Sweden peaked in 2000, 2002, 2004, and 2005 respectively.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>See also <a href=\"https://grist.org/transportation/the-evidence-that-the-world-has-passed-peak-car/\">this interview with Standage in Grist</a> (which features the phrase “horse-drawn transport monoculture”).</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>The pandemic caused a drop in driving, and then an uptick as people came out of lockdowns and decided, in some cases, that they would rather drive than use public transit. But the longer-term trend seems clear: driving is becoming less popular, because it’s becoming less convenient, and the alternatives are becoming more convenient. The growing prevalence of remote working may encourage people to move to urban fringes where it’s difficult to live without a car, but overall I don’t think this will be enough to reverse the longer-term trend.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>And here’s another excerpt of Standage’s book from The Guardian: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/aug/03/lost-history-electric-car-future-transport\">The lost history of the electric car — and what it tells us about the future of transport</a>.</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>In 1897, the bestselling car in the US was an electric vehicle: the Pope Manufacturing Company’s Columbia Motor Carriage. Electric models were outselling steam- and petrol-powered ones. By 1900, sales of steam vehicles had taken a narrow lead: that year, 1,681 steam vehicles, 1,575 electric vehicles and 936 petrol-powered vehicles were sold. Only with the launch of the Olds Motor Works’ Curved Dash Oldsmobile in 1903 did petrol-powered vehicles take the lead for the first time.</p> \n <p>Perhaps the most remarkable example, to modern eyes, of how things might have worked out differently for electric vehicles is the story of the Electrobat, an electric taxicab that briefly flourished in the late 1890s. The Electrobat had been created in Philadelphia in 1894 by Pedro Salom and Henry Morris, two scientist-inventors who were enthusiastic proponents of electric vehicles. In a speech in 1895, Salom derided “the marvelously complicated driving gear of a gasoline vehicle, with its innumerable chains, belts, pulleys, pipes, valves and stopcocks … Is it not reasonable to suppose, with so many things to get out of order, that one or another of them will always be out of order?”</p> \n <p>The two men steadily refined their initial design, eventually producing a carriage-like vehicle that could be controlled by a driver on a high seat at the back, with a wider seat for passengers in the front. In 1897 Morris and Salom launched a taxi service in Manhattan with a dozen vehicles, serving 1,000 passengers in their first month of operation. But the cabs had limited range and their batteries took hours to recharge. So Morris and Salom merged with another firm, the Electric Battery Company. Its engineers had devised a clever battery-swapping system, based at a depot at 1684 Broadway, that could replace an empty battery with a fully charged one in seconds, allowing the Electrobats to operate all day.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<strong>Tags:</strong> \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/A%20Brief%20History%20of%20Motion\">A Brief History of Motion</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/books\">books</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/cars\">cars</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Tom%20Standage\">Tom Standage</a>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 22 Sep 2021 21:03:23 +0000","feedId":33,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"2ea9610d589568018931bf98c60faf58","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Jason Kottke","publishedOrCreatedDate":1632761730573},{"createdTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:30","updatedTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:30","title":"A Grand Day Out","link":"https://kottke.org/21/09/a-grand-day-out","description":"<p><img src=\"https://kottke.org/plus/misc/images/kottke-fractured.jpg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1334\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Jason Kottke reflected in a fractured mirror\" /></p> \n<p>Hey all.

He wrote a remarkable little book back in 2019 called “The Psychology of Pandemics.” Its premise is that pandemics are “not simply events in which some harmful microbe ‘goes viral,’” but rather are mass psychological phenomena about the behaviors, attitudes and emotions of people.</p> \n <p>The book came out pre-COVID and yet predicts every trend and trope we’ve been living for 19 months now: the hoarding of supplies like toilet paper at the start; the rapid spread of “unfounded rumors and fake news”; the backlash against masks and vaccines; the rise and acceptance of conspiracy theories; and the division of society into people who “dutifully conform to the advice of health authorities” — sometimes compulsively so — and those who “engage in seemingly self-defeating behaviors such as refusing to get vaccinated.”</p> \n <p>He has no crystal ball, he says, it’s just that all of this has happened before. A lot of people believed the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918 was spread by the Germans through Bayer aspirin. It’s all based on basic psychology as to how people react to health emergencies.</p> \n <p>The denialists and refuseniks today are engaging in what the psychology field calls “psychological reactance.” It’s “a motivational response to rules, regulations, or attempts at persuasion that are perceived as threatening one’s autonomy and freedom of choice,” the book describes. Think what happens when someone says “Eat your broccoli.”</p> \n <p>Following onto that is what psychologists term “motivated reasoning.” That’s when people stick with their story even if the facts obviously are contrary to it, as a form of “comforting delusion,” Taylor says. The book covers “unrealistic optimism bias,” in which people in pandemics are prone to convincing themselves that it can’t or won’t happen to them.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>The book almost wasn’t even released at all — Taylor’s publisher <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/aug/19/book-psychology-pandemics-steven-taylor\">told him</a> the book was “interesting, but no one’s going to want to read it”.</p> \n<strong>Tags:</strong> \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/books\">books</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Covid-19\">Covid-19</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/psychology\">psychology</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Steven%20Taylor\">Steven Taylor</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/The%20Psychology%20of%20Pandemics\">The Psychology of Pandemics</a>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 20 Sep 2021 15:25:11 +0000","feedId":33,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"87eac3be35faea44a27064c84705c5b4","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Jason Kottke","publishedOrCreatedDate":1632761730038},{"createdTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:30","updatedTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:30","title":"Fiat’s Rooftop Racetrack","link":"https://kottke.org/21/09/fiats-rooftop-racetrack","description":"<p><img src=\"https://kottke.org/plus/misc/images/fiat-roof-track-01.jpg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"727\" border=\"0\" alt=\"a photo of the racetrack on top of the Fiat factory in Turin, Italy\" /></p> \n<p><img src=\"https://kottke.org/plus/misc/images/fiat-roof-track-02.jpg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"649\" border=\"0\" alt=\"a photo of the racetrack on top of the Fiat factory in Turin, Italy\" /></p> \n<p>When it was built in the 1920s in Turin, Italy, <a href=\"https://rarehistoricalphotos.com/racetrack-rooftop-factory-italy/\">the Fiat factory was designed with a racetrack on the top of the building</a>, both for car testing purposes and for racing.</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>The factory’s best-known symbol is the test track, which is a superb piece of design modeling, and construction that occupies the whole roof surface of the workshops. Two 443 meters straights, joined by parabolic bends, form a continuous track for testing the cars.</p> \n <p>Originally, as soon as the cars left the assembly lines they could flow directly upward to the test track through the snail-shaped ramps completing the whole processing cycle inside the factory. Moreover, these spiraling ramps inside the building allowed the cars to be driven back down and into showrooms.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>The track was a little over 1/2 mile long.

Whatever you find there, you can keep. But what are they really searching for?</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>I came across an article about the Crater of Diamonds State Park in Arkansas, which I learned is the world’s only public diamond-bearing site. People from all walks of life search for diamonds atop this ancient volcanic crater, and it’s finders keepers. Some people find substantial diamonds, some don’t, and either way, it takes a lot of digging in the dirt. I was immediately hooked on the metaphor of this place.</p> \n <p>I was interested in the hope of treasure, the grittiness of searching, and what people there were actually looking for in their lives. Creatively, I wanted to push an interview-driven piece, especially one in which subjects are given freedom to take you where they want to go, rather than guiding interviews along a plot-driven track. Errol Morris’ Vernon, Florida was a huge inspiration for this approach.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>That loudspeaker announcement right at the beginning is surreal — a great way to set the tone for the rest of the film.</p> \n<strong>Tags:</strong> \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Caitlyn%20Greene\">Caitlyn Greene</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/diamonds\">diamonds</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/video\">video</a>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 23 Sep 2021 21:16:10 +0000","feedId":33,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"d1d95b6ca76d6dd7ded2c00e96bce138","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Jason Kottke","publishedOrCreatedDate":1632761730584},{"createdTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:30","updatedTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:30","title":"Watch Flamingos Eat Underwater","link":"https://kottke.org/21/09/watch-flamingos-eat-underwater","description":"<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-1BF2XqboOo\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p> \n<p>As we learned from reading about the <a href=\"https://kottke.org/21/08/the-pink-salt-ponds-of-camargue-france\">pink salt ponds of Camargue, France</a>, flamingos get their distinctive pink coloring from the food that they eat — halophile algae and tiny animals like shrimp that feed on the algae.

Homeless by choice, he offers his services to small farms in exchange for food or a place to stay (though half his calories come from his sheeps’ milk).</p> \n <p>With a tiny metal cart home pulled by his sheep, he has a bed, a refrigerator/evaporative cooler, a shower (he uses a pesticide sprayer to pump up the water pressure), power (solar panel), sun oven, a mailbox stove for heat, bicycle tire wheels and a corrugated plastic roof.</p> \n <p>Fletcher makes cheese and butter from his sheep milk and forages for seeds, fruits, vegetables and herbs.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>I heard about this <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hova414/status/1437082426958876676\">from @hova414</a>, who teases it better than I can:</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>An “anti-consumer” gives one of the most impressive product demos I’ve ever seen; a nonstop highlights reel of ingenious off-grid inventions. Come for the wearable teepee, stay for the solar banana bread.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>My jaw legit dropped open at the solar bread part — <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00KLKJB72/ref=nosim/0sil8\">that solar oven</a>! It’s absolutely fascinating to listen to him explain how he efficiently uses space, public resources, and a limited amount of tightly curated technology products to live a happy and healthy life, an outcome many of us have been told by capitalism is impossible. I also enjoyed his distinction between being a selfish prepper and a community prepper:</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>By the way I’m a prepper, but I’m not like a normal prepper as in… I call it selfish prepping. I’m a community prepper. I’m not so interested in trying to survive in a post-apocalyptic situation if everyone around me is suffering. So I’m trying to figure out how to bring up the community so that they can all thrive.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>You can learn more about Fletcher’s life and how he lives it <a href=\"https://123homefree.org/\">on his website</a> and check out <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcDyrW1e5k52CQeLJceuIcf_PW2UsjDxl\">his YouTube videos</a> for more clever DIY tips.</p> \n<p><strong title=\"Sep 20, 2021\">Update:</strong> Milkshake duck alert — Fletcher’s brand of off-the-grid anti-authoritarianism apparently includes being an anti-vaxxer, as evidenced by some of the videos in his feed. “I’m not so interested in trying to survive in a post-apocalyptic situation if everyone around me is suffering” indeed… :(</p> \n<strong>Tags:</strong> \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Aaron%20Fletcher\">Aaron Fletcher</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/video\">video</a>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 17 Sep 2021 19:46:51 +0000","feedId":33,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"d02a2dc39ea2839e25c493c0a9244707","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Jason Kottke","publishedOrCreatedDate":1632761730038},{"createdTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:30","updatedTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:30","title":"The Astronomy Photographer of the Year for 2021","link":"https://kottke.org/21/09/the-astronomy-photographer-of-the-year-for-2021","description":"<p><img src=\"https://kottke.org/plus/misc/images/astronomy-year-2021-01.jpg\" width=\"1440\" height=\"1126\" border=\"0\" alt=\"360-degree view of the Milky Way galaxy\" /></p> \n<p><img src=\"https://kottke.org/plus/misc/images/astronomy-year-2021-02.jpg\" width=\"1440\" height=\"812\" border=\"0\" alt=\"the crescent moon rising over the desert\" /></p> \n<p>The Royal Museum Greenwich has <a href=\"https://www.rmg.co.uk/whats-on/astronomy-photographer-year/galleries/2021-overall-winners\">announced the winners of the Astronomy Photographer of the Year for 2021</a>.
