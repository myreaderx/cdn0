However, more and more <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/tag/electric-vehicle/\">electric vehicles</a> are on the road each day, and drivers feel the heat with the lack of available charging stations. With so many EVs on the road and so few charging stations, many EV drivers admit to feeling anxious during road trips, having to worry about their car dying of charge at any moment. A group of Seoul-based designers hopes to relieve some of that stress with their new EV charging solution called Nebo, a network of charging drones that bring the electric juice directly to EVs.</p>\n<p>To ensure their EVs remain charged when traveling, drivers often have to adjust their routes to incorporate charging stops along the way. Cutting out the extra travel time those routes take up, Nebo users can request charging drones to fly to their EV and power up their vehicles on the road. Then, drivers can plug in their destination from a dashboard display, and Nebo will find the quickest route and create a charging schedule for the trip, ensuring that EVs are fully charged. Each charging drone contains electromagnetic and ultrasonic sensors to locate and latch onto the roofs of electric vehicles.</p>\n<p>Once securely stationed atop the EV, charging coils transmit power between Nebo and the electric vehicle. The drones would also feature bladeless wings, allowing for a compact build that can slide into itself during use. An accompanying app would also allow users to request Nebo on the go. This would come in handy when your EV is parked, and you want to get some extra charge before taking the car out for a drive.</p>\n<p>Since EVs are hitting the roads more than ever before, the need for charging stations is growing. However, considering the lack of charging stations, those who drive electric vehicles have to worry too much about how they will get a charge. To help quell the anxiety felt by drivers of electric vehicles, Nebo brings the charge to drivers using a network of charging drones anytime, anywhere.</p>\n<p>Designers: Junpyo Hong, Jayoung Koo,

home– where we work is where we play is where we sleep. Many of us are finding isolated working zones, either through home renovation projects or <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/tag/cabin/\">tiny cabins</a> devoted to work, to separate our days and keep work where it belongs. French architecture company Novablok is unveiling their take on the remote office and living space through a prefabricated tiny cabin called Mini Blok that can be positioned anywhere work calls us.</p>\n<p>Mini Blok is a freestanding, simple cabin with a footprint of 21.6m2 that doesn’t require a permit to build or own. Without any foundation anchoring Mini Blok to the ground, the tiny cabin can be positioned in any location, from the backyard to a warehouse. With fully glazed walls, Mini Blok brings you up, close, and personal with nature. Novablok felt inspired to design their collection of tiny cabins, including Mini Blok, to create isolated spaces where working professionals and even individuals looking for a bit of a solitary respite can retreat and work or rest however they like. Tiny cabins are more popular than ever right now, for their low impact on the environment and escapist personalities. Mini Blok boasts a low carbon footprint and with such a sophisticated exterior and interior design, the workday might just end up becoming a work-cation.</p>\n<p>The finishes and cladding of Mini Blok can be chosen from an array of different options. Constructed from natural and sustainable materials as part of Novablok’s commitment to maintaining the health of France’s forests, Mini Blok can be personalized from three different finishes. Brut is the barest option, delivering Mini Blok with only its frame and internal structuring for individuals to build and furnish the cabin however they like. The essential finish comes with interior wood paneling and built-in electrical networks but leaves the furnishing and interior design up to you. Finally, Mini Blok’s signature finish comes entirely furnished and fitted for electricity, water, and sewer systems. The exterior cladding can be chosen from Douglas fir, red cedar, or burnt wood created using the tried and true Japanese technique called Yakisugi.</p>\n<p>Designer: <a href=\"https://novablok.com/\"

width=\"1280\" height=\"850\" /></p>\n<p>Did you know that 75 years ago, every kitchen was a zero-waste kitchen? Fun fact: in 1926, Austrian architect Margarete Schütte-Lihotzky&#8217;s kitchen had a wall of bins to store ingredients without any packaging at all! The concept of a zero-waste kitchen is not new and is certainly still in practice in many South Asian and East Asian countries that still use traditional storing and packaging methods. Obviously, our lives have changed and advanced tremendously over the last 75 years, so Ivana Steiner of Vienna is designing a zero-waste kitchen that fits our modern lifestyle and homes.</p>\n<p>Steiner visited six zero-waste stores in Vienna for research and as an architect who has always loved working on kitchens, she took it upon herself to bring change through design. She wanted to dedicate her kitchen design to work around the current climate crisis while combating it. &#8220;Zero Waste does not hope that politics and business will tell you how and when you will implement your environmental measures and goals, but rather that each of us can actively contribute to climate protection through a resource-saving lifestyle. Zero waste not only includes avoiding waste but also how we deal with nutrition and cooking. If we concentrate on fewer, regional foods without packaging, we can actually implement changes in our immediate surroundings,&#8221; says Steiner.</p>\n<p>This zero-waste kitchen is built from recycled stainless steel made in electric arc furnaces and it lasts forever. The large table is the core of the design, it is meant to be used as a cooking and eating surface. The structure has designated areas for glass containers, baskets for fruit and vegetables, a worm box, storage space for multi-purpose vessels, linen bags, and a vertical herb garden &#8211; it is indeed a highly functional and multi-faceted design! The worm box regularly provides humus which can be used for the herb garden and if the kitchen is in a dark area of the house or if you live in a country with little sunlight then you might need a daylight lamp for your herb garden.</p>\n<p>The built-in herb garden and worm composter together make the process very efficient even for those who are taking beginner steps into a sustainable lifestyle &#8211; this way, you&#8217;re set up for success because the maintenance is integrated into how the kitchen functions. This kitchen stores everything in jars to avoid producing waste in the form of bin liners. Jars are also easier to refill if you take them to your grocery store. This was a fairly calculated design decision as the buying trend moves towards more unpacked items, especially in urban areas where the food is stored and sold in glass containers to encourage reuse. Glass jars are also sealed tightly compared to bins making it a more sanitary option.</p>\n<p>Since the design is based on a minimalist lifestyle, the kitchen deliberately does not include upper cupboards or extra storage. You only keep things that you use every day &#8211; a limited number of 12 deep plates, 12 flat plates and 12 small flat plates, 12 water glasses, and 8 wine glasses are used and stored comfortably in the zero-waste kitchen. There is no dishwasher but it does come with a double sink for all intents and purposes as well as a rack for dishtowels. However, studies have shown that dishwashers are actually more efficient and save resources!</p>\n<p>The European-style kitchen has a lot of prep space in form of pullout panels, a small oven as well as a tiny fridge behind the Planet B typography. Zero Waste Kitchen is small, deliberate, and purposeful in every detail and encourages a life of fresh food without waste!</p>\n<p>Designer: Ivana Steiner</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full

love <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/tag/minimal/\">minimal</a> furniture designs! A subtle and simple piece of furniture can truly complete a room. It can be the final piece that makes a space come full circle, building a comfortable and cohesive haven, rather than a random area. <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/tag/furniture-designs/\">Furniture</a> pieces make or break a home, they add on to the essence or soul of a home, hence one needs to be extremely picky while choosing a furniture design. The design should be a reflection of you, and what you want your home to be. When you place a piece of furniture in a room, it should instantly integrate with the space, creating a wholesome and organic environment. And I believe minimal furniture designs do exactly that! Hence, we&#8217;ve curated a collection of furniture designs that truly embody minimalism and its quaint simplicity and zen-ness. Add these pieces to your home to create a living space that truly feels like yours! Enjoy!</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-325966\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/07/minimal-furniture-designs/minimal_furniture_design_yanko_design-06.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"850\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-325983\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/07/minimal-furniture-designs/minimal_furniture_yanko_design-20.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"850\" /></p>\n<p class=\"post-without-image\"><a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2021/06/22/this-minimal-desks-special-design-element-is-inspired-by-pianos/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Piano desk</a> gives that traditional piano design a nod by incorporating it into your familiar wooden desk with some additional inspiration from the Standard chair by Jean Prouvé that elevates the minimal piece. The Piano desk created so the designer could experiment with a hybrid material selection and play with interesting visual contrasts. On the one hand, we have metal which is a cold material that is beautifully balanced by the warmer wood. On the other hand, the same metal which allows for a slimmer silhouette is given the sturdiness with the addition of wood. The key factor in the briefing was to design a product with a democratic approach. That is how the minimal desk without any complex production processes was born while still featuring a small design element that other minimal desks didn’t have – the dipped shelf!</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-325969\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/07/minimal-furniture-designs/minimal_furniture_ds_yanko_design-01.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"850\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-325970\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/07/minimal-furniture-designs/minimal_furniture_ds_yanko_design-02.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"850\" /></p>\n<p class=\"post-without-image\"><a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2021/05/31/this-minimal-wooden-desk-elevates-your-furniture-functionality-with-a-minimal-all-black-aesthetic/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Ark desk</a> was designed for a client who wanted to increase the functionalities of his traditional table/desk – a need we have all realized during this pandemic. Ark is minimal in its design yet maximizes its surface area. The interesting thing about Ark’s design is that it can switch identities between the writing desk and the dressing table. The mirror is an optional feature for the desk, you can move its position based on what you are using it for. One of its sides is a downwards flanging cabinet included to increase storage. It provides a space for keeping cosmetics during dressing, books, or work-related files which ensures that the desktop space is clutter-free. The cabinet also keeps the items stored hidden from the front view which makes the overall visual of Ark a very clean and pleasing one!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/06/auto-draft/paperclip_chair_andrew_edge_1.jpg\" alt=\"Paperclip Chair by Andrew Edge\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/06/auto-draft/paperclip_chair_andrew_edge_2.jpg\" alt=\"Paperclip Chair by Andrew Edge\" /></p>\n<p class=\"post-without-image\">Stationery and Furniture really don’t have that much influence over one another. Just given their sheer size difference, the way a piece of stationery interacts with its surroundings is vastly different from how a piece of furniture does, considering its scale. However, Boston-based designer Andrew Edge is hoping to switch things up with <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2021/06/25/minimalist-chair-inspired-by-the-elegant-design-of-a-paperclip/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the Paperclip Chair</a>, a rather minimalist piece of furniture with oddly pleasing paperclip-shaped legs. The legs come with curved, angled forms made from metal piping, upon which rests the seat, yet another minimally designed detail.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-325974\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/07/minimal-furniture-designs/minimal_furniture_ds_yanko_design-08.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"850\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-325973\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/07/minimal-furniture-designs/minimal_furniture_ds_yanko_design-07.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"850\" /></p>\n<p class=\"post-without-image\">Sideboards are not thought of as dynamic or interactive but this furniture piece adds movement to the otherwise traditionally mundane design. It showcases a technical/mechanical approach to designing a sideboard and uses a combination of bearings + linkages for the sliding mechanism. The fun detail is that these are exposed and add more character to the piece. The front panel swivels over and the linkages push the drawer out. It’s crafted from maple and walnut wood with a glass top which gives it an evergreen aesthetic. The combination of woodwork and mechanics makes it an elegant vintage vibe.<a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2021/05/27/this-minimal-wooden-sideboard-has-a-pretty-cool-sliding-mechanism-watch-the-video/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Sideboard</a> has a universal appeal and the mechanism makes it more accessible for storing daily-use items as opposed to a junk closet.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-325971\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/07/minimal-furniture-designs/minimal_furniture_ds_yanko_design-03.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"850\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-325972\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/07/minimal-furniture-designs/minimal_furniture_ds_yanko_design-04.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"850\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2020/08/17/interstellars-black-hole-comes-to-life-in-this-minimal-black-and-white-furniture-design/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The minimal furniture collection</a> uses clean lines focused around an elevated seat, bringing to mind the stunning visuals of the Gargantua black hole portrayed in Christopher Nolan’s Interstellar. The story goes like this – Eugénie von Tunzelmann, a CG supervisor at Double Negative, generated a flat, multicolored ring – a stand-in for the accretion disk – and positioned it around their spinning black hole. Something very, very weird happened. ‘We found that warping space around the black hole also warps the accretion disk, so rather than looking like Saturn’s rings around a black sphere, the light creates this extraordinary halo.’ This warping halo brings to mind the lines showcased in this design. The furniture itself boasts of low tables that work as a coffee table as well as a bench, given the changing width of the design.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-325967\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/07/minimal-furniture-designs/minimal_furniture_design_yanko_design-14.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"850\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-325978\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/07/minimal-furniture-designs/minimal_furniture_ds_yanko_design-15.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"850\" /></p>\n<p class=\"post-without-image\">This chair is an amazing display of nostalgia and minimalism through furniture design. The designer wanted to incorporate our inherent ways of interacting with nature into a chair. <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2020/07/29/this-minimal-stubby-chair-brings-the-original-park-bench-home/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Stubby chair</a> was inspired by these environmental settings that combined the love for interiors with an element from the exterior world. Nature is the best designer (for the most part!) so observing nature gives the designer a lot of clues and points of directions where they should pay attention so it fits seamlessly into our lives. “Over time, you settle down with some household items, borrowed from nature. At the same time, you understand that the world is changing and you are changing with it,” she says describing the simplistic design which can age with time.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-325979\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/07/minimal-furniture-designs/minimal_furniture_ds_yanko_design-16.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"850\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-325980\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/07/minimal-furniture-designs/minimal_furniture_ds_yanko_design-17.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"850\" /></p>\n<p>Winner of the Golden Pin Design Award, <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2021/03/07/this-minimal-and-modular-cat-tree-perfectly-meets-the-needs-of-your-pet-your-home-and-you/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the Bien Bien Cat Tree</a> by Cheng-Liang Wu and Chia-Wen Lin is a cat tree that also masterfully doubles up as a piece of furniture. It’s a beautiful product that caters to the needs of both your cat (s) and you, functioning as a space that can be utilized and shared by humans and felines alike. You can build the modular cat tree all by yourself, its modularity allows it to be assembled in various ways, according to personal requirements, space restrictions, and of course, the moods of your cat. There are several shelving options for you to store your precious belongings in, as well as little nooks and crannies for your pet to sleep and play around in. Multiple accessories can be attached as means of recreation for your cat, and my favorite one, hands down, is the tiny hammock!</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-325975\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/07/minimal-furniture-designs/minimal_furniture_ds_yanko_design-09.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"850\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-325976\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/07/minimal-furniture-designs/minimal_furniture_ds_yanko_design-10.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"850\" /></p>\n<p>Nail four legs together put a seat on top, you have yourself a stool. That’s what the most simplistic and basic form of a stool is – four wooden legs capped with a circular or square seat. Award-winning designer João Teixeira, however, is challenging the notion of what that basic archetype of a wooden stool should look like. His design, <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2021/05/18/this-stools-minimal-design-challenges-how-wood-is-used-as-a-material/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the Knot Stool</a>, makes use of wood in an unusual way, lending it an appearance that resembles the styles of metal and plastic furniture. The Knot uses a lathe-spun seat beneath which sit three steam-bent wooden legs, giving the stool a fun, funky facelift.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-325981\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/07/minimal-furniture-designs/minimal_furniture_ds_yanko_design-18.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"850\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-325982\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/07/minimal-furniture-designs/minimal_furniture_ds_yanko_design-19.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"850\" /></p>\n<p>Designed by Annabella Hevesi, there is something about <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2021/05/26/this-organized-desk-design-with-hidden-details-will-give-you-major-japandi-feels/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the ODU Desk</a> that instantly puts me at ease. It’s just so well-designed! Clean, minimal, and soft, it’s a desk that almost gives me Japandi feels. (Japandi is a growing design trend that merges Japanese and Scandinavian aesthetics.) It’s a warm wooden desk with a protective screen around it that ensures you have your privacy while working! It shuts off the outside world and helps you focus completely on your work. Not to mention, the wooden desk top has been integrated with little storage containers! These containers are perfect for storing your office stationery, souvenirs, and other knick-knacks you may want to place on your desk. An interesting feature is that you can actually remove and separate the containers from the desk. This is perfect for when you want to clean the nooks and crannies of the desk.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-325977\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/07/minimal-furniture-designs/minimal_furniture_ds_yanko_design-11.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"850\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-325968\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/07/minimal-furniture-designs/minimal_furniture_designs_yanko_design-12.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"850\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2021/05/03/this-modern-minimal-sofa-gives-all-the-comfort-without-messing-the-cushions/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Bandage Sofa</a> is quite self-explanatory in its approach. The sofa uses a bandage in either the same color or a contrasting hue to hold your cushions in place – whether you choose to arrange for comfort or style! When members of the Bogdanova Bureau team started to design this sofa, they first thought about comfort. The first thing you imagine when you think about the couch is a dozen uncomfortable pillows, moving from side to side and making your rest miserable. With Bandage Sofa, your cushions stay just the way you want them to! The clean lines muted yet modern tones, and sleek design makes it a perfect match for every interior setting.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a

As odd as that design brief may sound, scientists at Carnegie Mellon University and Zhejiang University City College are trying to figure out how to make pasta more &#8216;efficient&#8217;. Sure, it may give a couple of traditional Italian cooks and nonnas a panic attack, but hey&#8230; science does what science does, right?</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/07/scientists-have-designed-programmable-pasta-shapes-that-transform-when-theyre-cooked/carnegie_mellon_programmable_pasta_shapes_1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"850\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-326077\" /></p>\n<p>Working on principles that are quite similar to those found in soft robotics and origami, these new pasta shapes start out as flat sheets of dried dough that warp into their signature design when you boil them in water. The secret lies in those unique ridges pressed into the pasta shapes that cause it to warp in different directions when the dough absorbs water and expands. The uniquely calibrated ridge depth and spacing, along with the pasta&#8217;s overall shape, result in some wonderfully unusual designs. It&#8217;s safe to say that the scientists must have gained a few pounds during the prototyping and testing phases. After all, who wouldn&#8217;t want to eat bowl after bowl of pasta for the sake of science??</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/07/scientists-have-designed-programmable-pasta-shapes-that-transform-when-theyre-cooked/carnegie_mellon_programmable_pasta_shapes_2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"850\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-326078\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/07/scientists-have-designed-programmable-pasta-shapes-that-transform-when-theyre-cooked/carnegie_mellon_programmable_pasta_shapes_3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"851\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-326079\" /></p>\n<p>The new pasta shapes are a combination of familiar and absolutely out-of-the-box forms, all calibrated to do two jobs &#8211; holding the sauce and tasting fabulous. Some of them are loosely based on popular designs like garganelli, fusilli, and ziti, while other shapes completely redefine the cuisine with how they look&#8230; with one clear distinction, creating a pasta that starts off as a flat, scored sheet of dough that transforms into a 3D shape when cooked.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This mechanism allows us to demonstrate approaches that could improve the efficiency of certain food manufacturing processes and facilitate the sustainable packaging of food, for instance, by creating morphing pasta that can be flat-packed to reduce the air space in the packaging&#8221;, say the researchers at Carnegie Mellon University and Zhejiang University.</p>\n<p>Designers: Scientists at Carnegie Mellon University and Zhejiang University City

designing better pet products. There&#8217;s a long-standing adage that form follows function, but good design is all about emotion too. A well-designed pet product doesn&#8217;t just functionally serve the pet&#8217;s needs, its aesthetics also keep the owner happy, creating a user experience that takes everyone into account. As they say, good design benefits everybody. Consider that the ethos of TOMO, an up-and-coming pet-gear brand fueled by great design. TOMO is a minimally designed, easy-to-connect, leash, collar, and harness set that will make your life easier and your dog more stylish.</p>\n<p>Designers: Brandon Lopez &#38; Eric Renard</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tomodog/tomo-easy-connect-dog-gear?ref=ei3czz\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Click Here to Buy Now: $80</strong></a> <del datetime=\"2021-06-15T12:15:06+00:00\">$100</del> (20% off).

Putting basic plaid collars and harnesses with those fiddly carabiner clips in the rear-view mirror, TOMO&#8217;s pet gear comes in beautiful matte black, from leash to collar to harness, and features a unique, robust metal clasp that&#8217;s minimal, durable, and easy to secure in a matter of seconds.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-325946\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/07/minimalist-dog-collar-with-a-snap-on-leash-gives-your-pet-the-ultimate-style-upgrade/easy_to_connect_leash_collar_and_harness_set_15.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"850\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tomodog/tomo-easy-connect-dog-gear?ref=ei3czz\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-325943\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/07/auto-draft/easy_to_connect_leash_collar_and_harness_set_14.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"849\" /></a></p>\n<p>All the products look like they&#8217;re a part of a wonderful ecosystem (unlike current pet-gear where the leash, collar, and dog-tag look different because they were all bought separately. The entire ecosystem of products draws a balance between functionality, comfort, and aesthetics, giving pet-gear a modern upgrade and making them complement each other when worn together, like a well-designed suit.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tomodog/tomo-easy-connect-dog-gear?ref=ei3czz\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/033/682/761/5c5b135f2f4eeecf8e923443c93540ff_original.gif?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&#38;w=680&#38;fit=max&#38;v=1622180004&#38;auto=format&#38;gif-q=50&#38;q=92&#38;s=19865b7b98d8d28a6bc9f35eebded30d\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tomodog/tomo-easy-connect-dog-gear?ref=ei3czz\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/033/725/984/afb447c5d0c0affab5af9ffee159c254_original.gif?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&#38;w=680&#38;fit=max&#38;v=1622529689&#38;auto=format&#38;gif-q=50&#38;q=92&#38;s=c7e78396c296320467d849e1599e9b4b\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tomodog/tomo-easy-connect-dog-gear?ref=ei3czz\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-325938\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/07/auto-draft/easy_to_connect_leash_collar_and_harness_set_10.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"850\" /></a></p>\n<p>The leash attaches to either the dog collar or the harness using a specially-designed patent-pending latch.

company that created the world&#8217;s first folding phone comes an open-source kit to help anyone build their own products with flexible displays!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://yankodesign.com/tag/royole\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Royole</a> has shown an incredible ability to find the right niche and pivot at the right time with their technological offerings. The company arguably built the first-ever flexible smartphone &#8211; the FlexPai &#8211; outpacing even Samsung, and their RoKit now aims at helping democratize the fully flexible display (FFD), so creatives and designers can tinker with it, building their own products too.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/07/auto-draft/royole_rokit_diy_flexible_display_kit_1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"850\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-325920\" /></p>\n<p>The kit comes packaged in a pretty impressive aluminum briefcase, containing everything you need to bring your unique tech idea to life. The upper part of the briefcase houses Royole&#8217;s 3rd Generation Cicada Wing 7.8-inch fully flexible touch-sensitive display, while the lower half of the briefcase contains a development motherboard running Android 10, an HDMI adapter (in case you want to connect your flexible display to an existing computer like a Raspberry Pi, smartphone, laptop, or any other gadget), and a bunch of power cables for good measure.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/07/auto-draft/royole_rokit_diy_flexible_display_kit_2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-325921\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/07/auto-draft/royole_rokit_diy_flexible_display_kit_3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-325922\" /></p>\n<p>The idea behind the RoKit, says Royole Founder and CEO Dr. Bill Liu, is to &#8220;invite every industry to imagine and design with flexibility in mind, unfolding new possibilities for creators and accelerating the development of flexible solutions in all walks of life.&#8221; Envisioned as the world&#8217;s first open platform flexible electronics development kit, the RoKit allows other creators to do exactly what Royole did with the FlexPai in 2018 &#8211; create electronic products that the world has never seen before.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/07/auto-draft/royole_rokit_diy_flexible_display_kit_4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-325923\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/07/auto-draft/royole_rokit_diy_flexible_display_kit_5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"850\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-325924\" /></p>\n<p>To show how limitless their flexible displays can be, Royole&#8217;s even created a few conceptual products that highlight exactly how folding screens can make products sleeker, smaller, and better. The examples include (as shown below) handheld gimbals/cameras with slide-out displays, a slick monolithic computer that transitions magically from keyboard to screen (<a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2020/02/13/apples-latest-patent-hints-at-a-revolutionary-curved-glass-imac-pro/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">I wonder where they got that idea from</a>), and even a helmet with a rear display that contours perfectly to the shape of the head, allowing you to communicate efficiently with drivers behind you.</p>\n<p>For now, the RoKit is available for purchase on the <a href=\"https://global.royole.com/us/rokit\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Royole website</a> in the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, Japan, and China. Priced at $959, it definitely isn&#8217;t cheap, although one could make the case that it&#8217;s just about affordable for being able to test out and prototype a product before you actually develop it with mass-produced flexible displays.</p>\n<p>Designer: <a href=\"https://global.royole.com/us\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Royole</a></p>\n<p><img

Award-winning footwear company CCILU has figured out how to turn coffee grounds into a waterproof, durable, sustainable, lightweight, and vegan alternative to materials like leather&#8230; moreover, with over a quarter-million tonnes of waste coffee grounds being generated each year, our coffee habit&#8217;s beginning to have a pretty noticeable impact on our environment.</p>\n<p>Designer: CCILU</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/xpresole/xpresole-panto-the-boots-made-from-upcycled-coffee-grounds\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Click Here to Buy Now: $99</strong></a> <del datetime=\"2021-07-12T03:23:24+00:00\">$116</del> (24% off).

The rain boots are waterproof, dirt-proof, breathable, lightweight, machine-washable, have high traction, and are sustainably made by recycling coffee grounds from as much as 15 cups of coffee per pair of boots. If that wasn&#8217;t enough, the XpreSole Panto also went on to win the Red Dot Best of Best, the iF Design Award, and the A&#8217; Design award this year. Is coffee all set to replace leather or PU leather as a footwear material? The folks at CCILU believe that the XpreSole Panto makes a pretty compelling case.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/xpresole/xpresole-panto-the-boots-made-from-upcycled-coffee-grounds\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-325950\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/07/boots_made_from_upcycled_coffee_grounds_01.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"1199\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/xpresole/xpresole-panto-the-boots-made-from-upcycled-coffee-grounds\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-325955\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/07/its-time-to-say-goodbye-to-leather-this-companys-making-award-winning-rain-boots-using-recycled-coffee/boots_made_from_upcycled_coffee_grounds_06.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"980\" /></a></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_247796\" style=\"width: 1290px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/xpresole/xpresole-panto-the-boots-made-from-upcycled-coffee-grounds\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-247796\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/033/550/987/61e6d016f6384cd8c2df6222fc8168fa_original.gif?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&#38;w=680&#38;fit=max&#38;v=1621313303&#38;auto=format&#38;gif-q=50&#38;q=92&#38;s=8755f4f201f28e4699dcdc953afc9966\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"850\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-247796\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Removable and breathable insoles keep feet dry and fresh.</p></div>\n<p>What&#8217;s rather remarkable about the XpreSole Panto is that it successfully manages to use coffee in almost every part of the shoe, barring probably just the laces.

Moreover, faux or synthetic leather is almost always made from plastic, adding to the plastic waste problem we&#8217;re currently facing as a species. Secondly, coffee waste is slowly becoming a burgeoning problem too, with roughly 1,000 tonnes of it being generated EACH DAY. Determined to hit two birds with one stone, CCILU decided to focus on creating meaningful, durable, and vegan footwear out of coffee. The coffee grounds are collected and dehumidified, before being turned into pellets using proprietary patented technology. Some of those are converted into thin yarns that are woven to create fabrics, while the remaining pellets are added as additives in a unique (and trade-secret) injection molding process to create the outsole and shell.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/xpresole/xpresole-panto-the-boots-made-from-upcycled-coffee-grounds\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-325958\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/07/its-time-to-say-goodbye-to-leather-this-companys-making-award-winning-rain-boots-using-recycled-coffee/boots_made_from_upcycled_coffee_grounds_09.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"1080\" /></a></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_325952\" style=\"width: 1290px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/xpresole/xpresole-panto-the-boots-made-from-upcycled-coffee-grounds\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-325952\" class=\"wp-image-325952 size-full\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/07/its-time-to-say-goodbye-to-leather-this-companys-making-award-winning-rain-boots-using-recycled-coffee/boots_made_from_upcycled_coffee_grounds_03.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"850\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-325952\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Low-Top</p></div>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/xpresole/xpresole-panto-the-boots-made-from-upcycled-coffee-grounds\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-325959\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/07/its-time-to-say-goodbye-to-leather-this-companys-making-award-winning-rain-boots-using-recycled-coffee/boots_made_from_upcycled_coffee_grounds_10.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"1080\" /></a></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_325953\" style=\"width: 1290px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/xpresole/xpresole-panto-the-boots-made-from-upcycled-coffee-grounds\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-325953\" class=\"wp-image-325953 size-full\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/07/its-time-to-say-goodbye-to-leather-this-companys-making-award-winning-rain-boots-using-recycled-coffee/boots_made_from_upcycled_coffee_grounds_04.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"980\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-325953\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">High-Top</p></div>\n<p>The multiple award-winning shoes come in a variety of earthy colors, and in low-top and high-top styles.
