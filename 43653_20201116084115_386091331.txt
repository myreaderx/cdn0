This very compact EVF fills a hole in the market with an affordable price tag of $399. Let&#8217;s take a closer look at it!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Chinese manufacturer PortKeys is starting to be well-known for making affordable monitoring solutions for filmmakers with a lot of built-in monitoring and camera control features. We first heard about the company with the fully-featured <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.cined.com/portkeys-bm5/\" target=\"_blank\">BM5 monitor that can control your camera</a>, then more recently the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.cined.com/portkeys-lh5h-released-affordable-5-monitor-control-camera/\" target=\"_blank\">LH5H that is HDMI-only</a> which we are currently reviewing &#8211; stay tuned for more info about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.cined.com/content/uploads/2020/11/PortKeysLEYE_01-640x360.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-163106\" srcset=\"https://www.cined.com/content/uploads/2020/11/PortKeysLEYE_01-640x360.jpg 640w, https://www.cined.com/content/uploads/2020/11/PortKeysLEYE_01-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.cined.com/content/uploads/2020/11/PortKeysLEYE_01-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.cined.com/content/uploads/2020/11/PortKeysLEYE_01-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://www.cined.com/content/uploads/2020/11/PortKeysLEYE_01-340x190.jpg 340w, https://www.cined.com/content/uploads/2020/11/PortKeysLEYE_01-409x230.jpg 409w, https://www.cined.com/content/uploads/2020/11/PortKeysLEYE_01-1600x900.jpg 1600w, https://www.cined.com/content/uploads/2020/11/PortKeysLEYE_01.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" /><figcaption>Image credit: PortKeys</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Who Is It For?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The PortKeys LEYE is not the company&#8217;s first try at making an EVF. Indeed, last year, <a href=\"https://www.cined.com/portkeys-oeye-3g-evf-1080p-oled-first-look/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">they released the OEYE-3G EVF</a> with SDI/HDMI input ports and a very high 1080P resolution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The OEYE-3G is targeted at professional users, while the PortKeys LEYE fills a big hole in the market for enthusiastic/filmmakers that don&#8217;t use an external viewfinder on a daily basis and are looking for an EVF that doesn&#8217;t break the bank.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.cined.com/content/uploads/2020/11/PortKeysLEYE_02-640x360.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-163109\" srcset=\"https://www.cined.com/content/uploads/2020/11/PortKeysLEYE_02-640x360.jpg 640w, https://www.cined.com/content/uploads/2020/11/PortKeysLEYE_02-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.cined.com/content/uploads/2020/11/PortKeysLEYE_02-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.cined.com/content/uploads/2020/11/PortKeysLEYE_02-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://www.cined.com/content/uploads/2020/11/PortKeysLEYE_02-340x190.jpg 340w, https://www.cined.com/content/uploads/2020/11/PortKeysLEYE_02-409x230.jpg 409w, https://www.cined.com/content/uploads/2020/11/PortKeysLEYE_02-1600x900.jpg 1600w, https://www.cined.com/content/uploads/2020/11/PortKeysLEYE_02.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" /><figcaption>Image credit: PortKeys</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>PortKeys LEYE &#8211; Display and Loupe</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The PortKeys LEYE features a 2.4&#8243; LCD screen with an effective resolution of 1440 x 900. The display is 8-bit &#8211; which is enough for framing your shots -and has a maximum brightness of 300nit with a 1100:1 contrast ratio.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-cinema_single_featured_photo\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://www.cined.com/content/uploads/2020/11/PortKeysLEYE_03-1600x900.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-163112\" srcset=\"https://www.cined.com/content/uploads/2020/11/PortKeysLEYE_03-1600x900.jpg 1600w, https://www.cined.com/content/uploads/2020/11/PortKeysLEYE_03-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.cined.com/content/uploads/2020/11/PortKeysLEYE_03-640x360.jpg 640w, https://www.cined.com/content/uploads/2020/11/PortKeysLEYE_03-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.cined.com/content/uploads/2020/11/PortKeysLEYE_03-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://www.cined.com/content/uploads/2020/11/PortKeysLEYE_03-340x190.jpg 340w, https://www.cined.com/content/uploads/2020/11/PortKeysLEYE_03-409x230.jpg 409w, https://www.cined.com/content/uploads/2020/11/PortKeysLEYE_03.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" /><figcaption>Image credit: PortKeys</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a loupe in front of the display, but it doesn&#8217;t look like you can flip it/remove it, according to the pictures. To fit nearly every filmmaker, the loupe of the LEYE features a +8 to -3 diopters adjustment. Also, the loupe&#8217;s back is totally round, with a &#8220;sponge eye mask&#8221; that prevents LCD sunburns and allows users with glasses to look at the EVF easily. However, no &#8220;traditional&#8221; eyecup is included, which is a little bit of a bummer.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.cined.com/content/uploads/2020/11/PortKeysLEYE_07-640x360.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-163125\" srcset=\"https://www.cined.com/content/uploads/2020/11/PortKeysLEYE_07-640x360.jpg 640w, https://www.cined.com/content/uploads/2020/11/PortKeysLEYE_07-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.cined.com/content/uploads/2020/11/PortKeysLEYE_07-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.cined.com/content/uploads/2020/11/PortKeysLEYE_07-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://www.cined.com/content/uploads/2020/11/PortKeysLEYE_07-340x190.jpg 340w, https://www.cined.com/content/uploads/2020/11/PortKeysLEYE_07-409x230.jpg 409w, https://www.cined.com/content/uploads/2020/11/PortKeysLEYE_07-1600x900.jpg 1600w, https://www.cined.com/content/uploads/2020/11/PortKeysLEYE_07.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" /><figcaption>Image credit: PortKeys</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Dimensions, Mounting Options and Power</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The PortKeys LEYE is very compact, with dimensions of only 106 x 70 x 78mm. Most of the device is made of plastic, except for the metal rear cover. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.cined.com/content/uploads/2020/11/PortKeysLEYE_04-640x360.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-163115\" srcset=\"https://www.cined.com/content/uploads/2020/11/PortKeysLEYE_04-640x360.jpg 640w, https://www.cined.com/content/uploads/2020/11/PortKeysLEYE_04-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.cined.com/content/uploads/2020/11/PortKeysLEYE_04-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.cined.com/content/uploads/2020/11/PortKeysLEYE_04-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://www.cined.com/content/uploads/2020/11/PortKeysLEYE_04-340x190.jpg 340w, https://www.cined.com/content/uploads/2020/11/PortKeysLEYE_04-409x230.jpg 409w, https://www.cined.com/content/uploads/2020/11/PortKeysLEYE_04-1600x900.jpg 1600w, https://www.cined.com/content/uploads/2020/11/PortKeysLEYE_04.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" /><figcaption>Image credit: PortKeys</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This cover also features all the mounting points: a built-in NATO rail and three 1/4&#8243;-20 mounting points with ARRI locking pins.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.cined.com/content/uploads/2020/11/PortKeysLEYE_05-640x360.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-163119\" srcset=\"https://www.cined.com/content/uploads/2020/11/PortKeysLEYE_05-640x360.jpg 640w, https://www.cined.com/content/uploads/2020/11/PortKeysLEYE_05-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.cined.com/content/uploads/2020/11/PortKeysLEYE_05-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.cined.com/content/uploads/2020/11/PortKeysLEYE_05-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://www.cined.com/content/uploads/2020/11/PortKeysLEYE_05-340x190.jpg 340w, https://www.cined.com/content/uploads/2020/11/PortKeysLEYE_05-409x230.jpg 409w, https://www.cined.com/content/uploads/2020/11/PortKeysLEYE_05-1600x900.jpg 1600w, https://www.cined.com/content/uploads/2020/11/PortKeysLEYE_05.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" /><figcaption>Image credit: PortKeys</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Like the PortKeys OEYE-3G, the LEYE doesn&#8217;t have a built-in battery. You can power it via the DC 7-24V barrel port or 5V USB Type-A port on the device&#8217;s right side. It means that you&#8217;ll have to use an external battery to power the EVF, either a V-Lock/Gold-Mount battery or a power bank.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, there&#8217;s an HDMI input port on the right side, above the power inputs, that can take video signals of up to 4K30p. There is no video output port.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.cined.com/content/uploads/2020/11/PortKeysLEYE_08-640x360.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-163128\" srcset=\"https://www.cined.com/content/uploads/2020/11/PortKeysLEYE_08-640x360.jpg 640w, https://www.cined.com/content/uploads/2020/11/PortKeysLEYE_08-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.cined.com/content/uploads/2020/11/PortKeysLEYE_08-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.cined.com/content/uploads/2020/11/PortKeysLEYE_08-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://www.cined.com/content/uploads/2020/11/PortKeysLEYE_08-340x190.jpg 340w, https://www.cined.com/content/uploads/2020/11/PortKeysLEYE_08-409x230.jpg 409w, https://www.cined.com/content/uploads/2020/11/PortKeysLEYE_08-1600x900.jpg 1600w, https://www.cined.com/content/uploads/2020/11/PortKeysLEYE_08.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" /><figcaption>Image credit: PortKeys</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Monitoring Tools</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On top of the EVF, you&#8217;ll find four user-assignable buttons.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-cinema_single_featured_photo\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://www.cined.com/content/uploads/2020/11/PortKeysLEYE_06-1600x900.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-163122\" srcset=\"https://www.cined.com/content/uploads/2020/11/PortKeysLEYE_06-1600x900.jpg 1600w, https://www.cined.com/content/uploads/2020/11/PortKeysLEYE_06-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.cined.com/content/uploads/2020/11/PortKeysLEYE_06-640x360.jpg 640w, https://www.cined.com/content/uploads/2020/11/PortKeysLEYE_06-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.cined.com/content/uploads/2020/11/PortKeysLEYE_06-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://www.cined.com/content/uploads/2020/11/PortKeysLEYE_06-340x190.jpg 340w, https://www.cined.com/content/uploads/2020/11/PortKeysLEYE_06-409x230.jpg 409w, https://www.cined.com/content/uploads/2020/11/PortKeysLEYE_06.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" /><figcaption>Image credit: PortKeys</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Like all PortKeys products, the LEYE features all the monitoring tools you need, including;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>3D LUT monitoring</li><li>Waveform, Luma, Histogram, false color, and zebra</li><li>Peaking, zooming, and audio meters</li><li>Crosshair, framing guides, grids, aspects</li><li>Sharpness, chroma, brightness, backlight, display flip, tint, color temperature adjustments</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.cined.com/content/uploads/2020/11/PortKeysLEYE_09-640x360.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-163131\" srcset=\"https://www.cined.com/content/uploads/2020/11/PortKeysLEYE_09-640x360.jpg 640w, https://www.cined.com/content/uploads/2020/11/PortKeysLEYE_09-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.cined.com/content/uploads/2020/11/PortKeysLEYE_09-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.cined.com/content/uploads/2020/11/PortKeysLEYE_09-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://www.cined.com/content/uploads/2020/11/PortKeysLEYE_09-340x190.jpg 340w, https://www.cined.com/content/uploads/2020/11/PortKeysLEYE_09-409x230.jpg 409w, https://www.cined.com/content/uploads/2020/11/PortKeysLEYE_09-1600x900.jpg 1600w, https://www.cined.com/content/uploads/2020/11/PortKeysLEYE_09.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" /><figcaption>Image credit: PortKeys</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Price and Availability</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The PortKeys LEYE is available now for $399.
