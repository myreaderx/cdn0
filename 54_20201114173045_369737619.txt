These pages get website visitors to convert to the next stage in <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/what-is-the-buyers-journey\">the buyer's journey</a>. </span></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: transparent;\"></span></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: transparent;\">Rather than serving as a basic advertisement that shows a customer a product, a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/best-landing-page-builder\">landing page</a> aims to engage and delight a customer by offering them something that relates to the product or the company's industry. When they fill out the form and receive a reward of interesting content, they might be even more likely to trust your brand and become a customer.<br><br><strong>Quick tip:</strong> Want an easy way to add a form to your landing page? <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/forms\">HubSpot’s free form builder tool</a> can help you fill your CRM with leads from your website. <br></span></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: transparent;\">Let’s talk through an example of when a landing page can be especially effective. If a business wants to sell an AI product that helps salespeople, they might create a landing page that offers audiences a free video on how to use AI in the sales industry. Interested audiences might offer their contact information in exchange for the valuable information. If they enjoy the video they've received, they might be more likely to respond to or purchase a product from a company rep who calls them.</span></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: transparent;\">In another scenario, a publishing company that targets an audience of chief executives might create a landing page that invites audiences to sign up for a webinar hosted by an executive at a major company. </span></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: transparent;\">After giving their email address on the signup form presented on the landing page, the leads get an email with the webinar dates and log in information, as well as instructions on how to sign up for the publication's newsletter or subscription. If the user is pleased by the webinar, they might sign up for the newsletter or a subscription to keep up with similar publication content. </span></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: transparent;\">Although their purpose is simple enough in theory, actually designing a successful landing page requires some detailed planning and </span><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/design-website-experiments?_ga=2.259813322.1706660370.1562589600-1582690004.1559596502\" style=\"letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: transparent;\">creative testing</a><span style=\"letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: transparent;\">.</span></p> \n<p>Even after launching your landing page, you'll want to pay attention to conversion rates to see how well it's doing.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p><span>To determine your conversion rate, simply divide the number of conversions a webpage generates by the number of people who visited that page.</span></p> \n<p><span>If your conversion rate isn't close to the average just yet, don't worry. </span><a href=\"https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/03/17/what-is-a-good-conversion-rate\">Nailing those percentages </a>can be a bit challenging at first, especially is you have a lot of regular page visitors. Luckily, there are a number of simple <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/conversion-rate-optimization-guide\">conversion rate optimization strategies</a> that can help you boost your current rate quickly.</p> \n<p>Regardless of what your business is selling or the conversion action you hope to instigate, it's helpful to get inspired by seeing what other great landing pages look like. And because there's no one \"right\" way of <a href=\"http://pearl.stylemixthemes.com/landing/\">designing a landing page</a>, you'll want to check out examples from lots of different industries for different stages of the buying process.</p> \n<p>Want to get inspired? Check out the great landing page examples below.</p> \n<p>We don't have access to the analytics for each of these landing pages, so I can't tell you specifically how well they convert visitors, contacts, leads, and customers. But many of them do follow best practices while also implementing a few new experiments that could give you ideas for your own landing pages.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h2>13 Great Examples of Landing Page Design</h2> \n<h3>1. <a href=\"https://www.lyft.com/drive-for-lyft\">Lyft</a></h3> \n<p>We love that on Lyft's landing page, they zero in on their drivers' main motivation: earning money easily.</p> \n<p>We also love that, in addition to the \"Apply Now\" form, drivers can type their city and the number of hours they might drive for Lyft in a week to calculate how much they'd make. When visitors fill out that information and press \"Calculate,\" they aren't taken to a new page. Instead, they see a dollar amount followed by a new call-to-action button to \"Apply Now\" (which, once clicked, takes drivers up to the form).</p> \n<p>By offering these two conversion paths, they're able to address two different types of people in the conversion path: those who are ready to make the decision now <em>and</em> those who need a little more information before they convert.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/lyft-landing-page.png?width=667&amp;height=501&amp;name=lyft-landing-page.png\" alt=\"lyft-landing-page\" width=\"667\" height=\"501\"></p> \n<h3>2. <a href=\"http://www.theprofessionalwingman.com/apply-for-coaching-1\">The Professional Wingman</a></h3> \n<p>Okay, so the whole idea of having a professional wingman to help you find dates and a meaningful relationship is already pretty cool. But when you're faced with the prospect of hiring one, it also raises questions. How does it work? How much does it cost? Is this really going to help me?</p> \n<p>That's why we love this landing page for Thomas Edwards, the original Professional Wingman himself, which outlines exactly what a complimentary coaching session is going to achieve. Plus, it's clear that it's complimentary, thanks to the boldly-colored call-to-action button above the fold.</p> \n<p>Once you click that button, you aren't taken to a new page. Instead, an interstitial form appears right there. And while it does request a lot of information -- some of it a bit personal -- it also sends the message that The Professional Wingman is going to take this seriously, but only if you do, too.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/professional%20wingman.gif?width=669&amp;name=professional%20wingman.gif\" alt=\"professional wingman landing page\" width=\"669\" title=\"professional wingman.gif\" style=\"width: 669px;\"></p> \n<h3>3. <a href=\"http://muckrack.com/\">Muck Rack</a></h3> \n<p>This landing page design has it all. It's visually appealing and interactive, offers scannable yet descriptive headers about Muck Rack's services, and uses quotes from industry professionals as social proof. Plus, the page is intuitive and easy to navigate.</p> \n<p>The cool part about this landing page is that it can appeal to both of Muck Rack's audiences. The top of the page is split into two, featuring their two different services side by side. Once a visitor moves his or her mouse over either of the \"find journalists\" or the \"build free portfolio\" CTAs, a very <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/forms\">simple form</a> appears -- and that's important, so as not to distract the user from the task at hand.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" style=\"width: 669px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/muckrack.gif?width=669&amp;name=muckrack.gif\" alt=\"muckrack landing page\" width=\"669\" title=\"muckrack.gif\"></p> \n<h3>4. <a href=\"https://www.cigital.com/resources/ebooks-and-whitepapers/security-threat-modeling-misconceptions/\">Cigital</a></h3> \n<p>There are a few things that make this Cigital landing page work. It has simple and relevant imagery. The headline is straightforward and the description of the ebook informs viewers of the specific value they will get by downloading it. There is only one call-to-action -- \"READ THE EBOOK\" -- that stands out on the page thanks to a bright yellow CTA button.</p> \n<p>The only thing we'd change about this landing page is that we'd remove the navigation bar at the top. They tend to distract visitors and lead them away from the intended action. Not only is this a landing page design best practice, but <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/landing-page-navigation-ht\">we've also conducted A/B tests</a> that've shown removing navigation links from landing pages increases conversion rates.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" style=\"width: 669px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Cigital.gif?width=669&amp;name=Cigital.gif\" alt=\"Cigital landing page\" width=\"669\" title=\"Cigital.gif\"></p> \n<h3>5. <a href=\"https://www.khanacademy.org/\">Khan Academy</a></h3> \n<p>The hard part about using your homepage as a landing page is that you have to cater to several different types of audiences. But Khan Academy's homepage does that very well. This page is clearly designed for three different types of visitors: those who want to learn something, those who want to teach, and parents who are interested in using Khan Academy for their kids. Plus, how motivational is the emblazoned \"You can learn anything\" text at the top?</p> \n<p>The remainder of the page is designed for viewers who are not completely familiar with Khan Academy. It colorfully and largely spells out the key benefits of using the learning platform -- all of which are easy to scan and understand. There's also a recurring CTA: \"Start learning now.\" As soon as viewers feel they have enough information, they can click the CTA to get taken back up to the form at the top of the page without having to scroll.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" style=\"width: 669px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/khan%20academy.gif?width=669&amp;name=khan%20academy.gif\" alt=\"khan academy landing page\" width=\"669\" title=\"khan academy.gif\"></p> \n<h3>6. <a href=\"https://clubw.com/gifts/corporate/\">Club W</a></h3> \n<p>A little bit of <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33441/10-Companies-That-Totally-Nail-Copywriting.aspx\">delightful copy can go a long way</a> on your landing page. We love the playful little aside -- \"(Hint: It's Wine)\" -- that Club W included below the header of their corporate gifting landing page. It humanizes the brand and makes them likable, which could have a positive impact on their conversion rate.</p> \n<p>The images below that header make a nice use of negative space, showing the user exactly what his or her gift recipient might actually receive, should they choose to gift with Club W. And, of course, there's that bold call to action -- \"Email Us\".</p> \n<p>The one thing we'd change? The CTA prompts the users email software to open, which drives traffic away from the site and the browser entirely. A form might be more effective here -- not only would Club W be able to dictate what information it wants to capture, but also, it would keep the user on-site.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/club%20w.gif?width=669&amp;name=club%20w.gif\" style=\"width: 669px;\" width=\"669\" alt=\"club w landing page\" title=\"club w.gif\"></p> \n<h3>7. <a href=\"http://www.codecademy.com/\">Codecademy</a></h3> \n<p>I like this page because it's simple in both copy and design. The image above the fold is a computer screen displaying an HTML bracket with a blinking cursor -- a whimsical, clear visual to accompany the form on the right.</p> \n<p>The form itself is simple and only requires an email address, username, password, and a validation that you're not a robot to create an account. Or, you can just use your Facebook or Google Plus login, shortening the conversion path even further.</p> \n<p>For visitors who need more information before creating an account, the landing page also offers a video below the fold that explains their concept and value by way of a real-life success story. Again, this helps make the potentially intimidating world of coding more approachable for beginners.</p> \n<p>Those who need even more convincing can continue scrolling for additional testimonials and other forms of social proof.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/codecademy.gif?width=669&amp;name=codecademy.gif\" alt=\"codecademy landing page\" width=\"669\" title=\"codecademy.gif\" style=\"width: 669px;\"></strong></p> \n<h3>8. <a href=\"https://poachedjobs.com/choose/\">Poached</a></h3> \n<p>I don't think we've ever lived in a time when, culturally, we've been so food-obsessed. Poached has turned that into a B2B model with a platform to connect proprietors and culinary talent.</p> \n<p>When you visit the homepage, there's no mystery about what you're there to do -- the giant \"Post a job\" and \"Choose a city\" calls to action help with that. And once you click on one of them, you're taken to a no-frills form to become a member or log in, or a list of jobs in each city. It's colorful and comprehensive -- and, it makes us hungry.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/poached.gif?width=669&amp;name=poached.gif\" alt=\"poached landing page\" width=\"669\" title=\"poached.gif\" style=\"width: 669px;\"></p> \n<h3>9. <a href=\"https://breather.com/\">Breather</a></h3> \n<p>Here's another example of clever, delightful design on a landing page. As soon as you visit Breather.com, there's an instant call to action: indicate where you want to find a space. Plus, it uses location services to figure out where you are, providing instant options nearby.</p> \n<p>We love how Breather used simple, to-the-point copy to let the visitor know what the company does, followed immediately by the CTA to select a city. And if you need to scroll down for more information, you can see that Breather <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/writing-great-microcopy\">played with the microcopy</a> with personality (\"no commitment, ever\"), reminding us there are real humans behind the design. That brings us a little closer to the brand. The negative space and soothing color scheme are also aligned with the product -- essentially, room to breathe.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/breather.gif?width=669&amp;name=breather.gif\" style=\"width: 669px;\" width=\"669\" alt=\"breather.gif\" title=\"breather.gif\"></p> \n<h3>10. <a href=\"https://www.startupinstitute.com/apply/\">Startup Institute</a></h3> \n<p>Visitors to your website won't hand over their personal information without knowing what they're going to get in return. On its landing page, Startup Institute makes abundantly clear what will happen after you apply by listing a Q&amp;A right beside the form. It might prompt some people to say, \"They read my mind!\"</p> \n<p>To avoid hesitancy to fill out a form, use your landing page to set expectations upfront. That clears the air, and can also weed out the people who don't take your content, product or service seriously.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Startup%20Institute.gif?width=669&amp;name=Startup%20Institute.gif\" width=\"669\" alt=\"Startup Institute landing page\" title=\"Startup Institute.gif\" style=\"width: 669px;\"></p> \n<h3>11. <a href=\"http://edupath.com/planding/PSO020414/\">Edupath</a></h3> \n<p>Who is your landing page's target audience? While most of Edupath's website content is directed toward students, there are sections dedicated to advising parents on helping their teenagers through college applications and SAT preparation. The landing page below is in one of these sections.</p> \n<p>When parents fill out their teenager's name, email address, and mobile number, a link to download the Edupath app is sent directly to them. The folks at Edupath know students are likely to do something if their parents ask them to -- especially if it means they don't have to surrender their phones.</p> \n<p>Plus, it's an easy, one-click process. This whole conversion path is a clever and helpful way to get the apps on more students' phones by way of their parents.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/edupath.gif?width=669&amp;name=edupath.gif\" width=\"669\" alt=\"edupath landing page\" title=\"edupath.gif\" style=\"width: 669px;\"></p> \n<h3>12. <a href=\"https://www.tastersclub.com/\">Taster's Club</a></h3> \n<p>If there's anything we enjoy more than a fine whiskey, it's a whiskey club homepage that makes it easy to either join or learn more about membership. Case in point: Taster's Club, which immediately serves up those very two CTAs on its landing page -- which also happens to be its homepage.</p> \n<p>For those to wish to learn more, clicking that CTA will immediately scroll the user down to colorful, image-rich details on what a Taster's Club membership includes. Keep scrolling, and you get user testimonials.</p> \n<p>But clicking the \"Join Now\" button is where the real fun begins. After doing that, you get to pick your poison -- that is, the type of whiskey you like the most -- and view the membership or gifting options available for it. Once you make your selections, you're taken to an easy-to-navigate checkout page to enter your payment information. Good design and ease of use? We'll drink to that.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/taster's%20club.gif?width=669&amp;name=taster's%20club.gif\" width=\"669\" alt=\"taster's club landing page\" title=\"taster's club.gif\" style=\"width: 669px;\"></p> \n<h3>13. <a href=\"https://info.microsoft.com/US-SCRTY-WBNR-FY19-06Jun-20-SpeakingofsecurityPrivacycompliance-1712_LP02OnDemandRegistration-ForminBody.html\">Microsoft IT Showcase</a></h3> \n<p>The landing page below has been used to market and generate leads for one episode of Microsoft's IT Showcase webinar series.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Microsoft%20IT%20Showcase%20Webinar%20Landing%20page.jpg?width=1449&amp;name=Microsoft%20IT%20Showcase%20Webinar%20Landing%20page.jpg\" alt=\"Microsoft IT Showcase Webinar Landing page\" width=\"1449\" style=\"width: 1449px;\"></p> \n<p>This simple and straightforward design does a great job of presenting why the webinar being offered is important to IT professionals. Along with a quick blurb describing what the webinar will discuss, the page also includes links to similar webinars, details on the speakers, and links to Microsoft resources that touch on the topics that will be discussed.</p> \n<p>An IT company which has access to thought leaders or experts in their industry could similarly use this webinar landing page strategy to generate both leads and prospective customer trust. Audiences who feel informed after reading the landing page might sign up expecting the webinar to be insightful.</p> \n<p>If the webinar seems informative and credible, these audiences will think that the IT company has an expertise in the product and might have quality product offerings. This will make them more willing to talk to a representative to learn more or purchase a product.</p> \n<h2>Ready to build your landing page?</h2> \n<p>If these examples have inspired you, but you're not a design expert, we've also created a great list of <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/free-landing-page-templates\">free, professionally designed landing page templates</a>.</p> \n<p>If you're looking for more landing page design examples, check out some of our favorite <a href=\"https://academy.hubspot.com/examples#filter=.landing-page\">HubSpot landing page examples</a>.

Help Scout, makers of customer service software, uses a unique but minimalist design on its blog that we love -- it<span>&nbsp;limits the&nbsp;use of copy and visuals and embraces negative space.</span></p> \n<p>What we particularly like about this blog is its use of featured images for all posts, including a banner one at the top that highlights a recent or particularly popular entry. These icons are&nbsp;set in front of bright, block colors that catch the readers' eye and signal what the post is about. And it works -- everything about this&nbsp;blog's design says \"clean\" and \"readable.\"</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"content-post__body\"><span class=\"content-post__body\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Help_Scout_Blog-2.png?width=671&amp;name=Help_Scout_Blog-2.png\" width=\"671\" alt=\"Help_Scout_Blog-2.png\" title=\"Help_Scout_Blog-2.png\" style=\"width: 671px;\" /></span></span></p> \n<a></a> \n<h3><span class=\"content-post__body\"><span>2.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://news.microsoft.com/stories/index.html\">Microsoft Stories</a><a href=\"http://news.microsoft.com/stories/index.html\"></a></span></span></h3> \n<p><span class=\"content-post__body\">Full disclosure: We've totally gushed over Microsoft's \"Stories\" microsite <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/microsoft-stories-editorial-process?_ga=1.66271790.1053898511.1470656920\">before</a>. We can't help it -- what better way to revitalize an old-school brand than with a blog that boasts beautiful, interactive, and inspiring branded content? Plus,&nbsp;the square layout of these&nbsp;stories&nbsp;<span class=\"content-post__body\">is</span>&nbsp;reminiscent of&nbsp;the Microsoft logo, which achieves a valuable <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/unexpected-companies-twitter-content#sm.0000e1w1nuwvbeo5sq61j1tim2kyj\">brand consistency</a>.</span></p> \n<p>Microsoft Stories is also a prime example of how a business blog can be a major asset for an overall rebrand. In recent years, Microsoft has worked to humanize its brand, largely in response to <a href=\"http://www.brandknewmag.com/index.php/the-ad-battle-between-apple-and-microsoft-is-back/\">a rivalry&nbsp;with Apple</a>. The \"Stories\" microsite has a simple tagline -- \"Get an inside look at the people, places and ideas that move us.\" It's the softer side of Microsoft, so to speak.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>When you're trying to convey a certain brand message, your blog can be used to communicate it -- both aesthetically, and content-wise.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"content-post__body\"><span class=\"content-post__body\"><span class=\"content-post__body\"><span><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/00-Blog_Thinkstock_Images/Microsoft_Stories_Blog.png?width=671&amp;name=Microsoft_Stories_Blog.png\" width=\"671\" alt=\"Microsoft_Stories_Blog.png\" title=\"Microsoft_Stories_Blog.png\" style=\"width: 671px;\" /></span></span></span></span></p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>3.&nbsp;<a title=\"PandoDaily\" href=\"https://pando.com/\">Pando</a><a title=\"PandoDaily\" href=\"https://pando.com/\"></a></h3> \n<p>An important aspect of a well-designed blog is a consistent color scheme and style -- after all, <a href=\"http://www.webpagefx.com/blog/web-design/psychology-of-color-infographic/\">80% of consumers say that color boosts their recognition of a brand</a>.</p> \n<p>It's interesting to see how color consistency can unify the more diversified elements of design. Pando, a blog that explores the startup cycle, incorporates blue&nbsp;tones in several sections of its site -- the background, highlight bars, and certain areas of text. But it also uses several different fonts -- all of which manage to look seamless together,&nbsp;when tied together by a cohesive color scheme.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"content-post__body\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Pando_Blog.png?width=671&amp;name=Pando_Blog.png\" width=\"671\" alt=\"Pando_Blog.png\" title=\"Pando_Blog.png\" style=\"width: 671px;\" /></span></p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>4.&nbsp;<a title=\"Design Milk\" href=\"http://design-milk.com/\">Design Milk</a><a title=\"Design Milk\" href=\"http://design-milk.com/\"></a></h3> \n<p>Design Milk, an online contemporary design outlet, uses a very simple layout to highlight its posts. The sidebar to the right -- which remains visible&nbsp;when a blog post is opened to read -- is perfect for showcasing&nbsp;thumbnail images for&nbsp;new articles. That's an <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/inbound-links-faqs#sm.0000e1w1nuwvbeo5sq61j1tim2kyj\">internal link</a> strategy, which helps to encourage readers to remain on the site longer.</p> \n<p>The social icons at the top are a pleasant addition to the overall look and feel of the site -- they're easy to spot, and make it easy to share Design Milk's content. (And to learn more about adding social buttons to your blog, check out&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/29544/The-Ultimate-Cheat-Sheet-for-Creating-Social-Media-Buttons.aspx\">this post</a>.)</p> \n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen_Shot_2016-09-30_at_10.42.15_AM.png?width=671&amp;name=Screen_Shot_2016-09-30_at_10.42.15_AM.png\" style=\"width: 671px;\" width=\"671\" alt=\"Design Milk Blog.png\" title=\"Design Milk Blog.png\" /></h4> \n<a></a> \n<h3><span class=\"content-post__body\">5.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.fubiz.net/\">Fubiz</a><a href=\"http://www.fubiz.net/\"></a></span></h3> \n<p><span>Fubiz, an art and design blog, is an example of a&nbsp;really sleek design that also includes&nbsp;some cool personalization. </span></p> \n<p><span>Near the top of the blog's homepage, readers&nbsp;can side-scroll through \"highlighted\" posts. Below that is the Creativity Finder, where visitors&nbsp;can select their chosen&nbsp;personas -- from \"Art Lover\" to \"Freelance\" -- location, and the type of content they're looking for. From there, readers can browse content specifically catered to them.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span>We can't help but love the header image, too. It uses something called <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Mind-Surprising-Healthier-Connected/dp/0316252085\">\"blue mind\"</a> psychology, which has found that the sight of open water can naturally draw us in. By using it in a design scheme, Fubiz is able to visually attract visitors to its content.</span></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"content-post__body\"><span class=\"content-post__body\"><span class=\"content-post__body\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen_Shot_2016-09-30_at_10.45.16_AM.png?width=671&amp;name=Screen_Shot_2016-09-30_at_10.45.16_AM.png\" width=\"671\" alt=\"Fubiz blog.png\" title=\"Fubiz blog.png\" style=\"width: 671px;\" /></span></span></span></p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>6.&nbsp;<a title=\"Webdesigner Depot\" href=\"http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/\">Webdesigner Depot</a><a title=\"Webdesigner Depot\" href=\"http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/\"></a></h3> \n<p>With a name like \"Webdesigner Depot,\" it's no wonder that this design news site is visually appealing.</p> \n<p>One thing that we particularly like is the way Webdesigner Depot has incorporated social sharing icons on each individual post. While we of course suggest actually reading each piece, having those links readily available helps visitors immediately share a headline they find interesting. And check out those navigation arrows on the right -- never before has it been so easy to scroll to the top or bottom of a page.</p> \n<p>What's more, the color scheme, background, and fonts are all consistent -- which keeps this blog looking professional, but still distinct from the basic blog templates we&nbsp;might be&nbsp;used to seeing.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"content-post__body\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen_Shot_2016-09-30_at_11.00.18_AM.png?width=671&amp;name=Screen_Shot_2016-09-30_at_11.00.18_AM.png\" width=\"671\" alt=\"Webdesigner Depot Blog.png\" title=\"Webdesigner Depot Blog.png\" style=\"width: 671px;\" /></span></p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>7.&nbsp;<a title=\"Mashable\" href=\"http://mashable.com/\">Mashable</a><a title=\"Mashable\" href=\"http://mashable.com/\"></a></h3> \n<p>I mean, just look at that header image. The bold colors, the wiring overlay, the gripping pupil and the contrasting text. It absolutely catches the reader's eye -- no pun intended.</p> \n<p>Mashable breaks its content into three noticeable sections on the homepage: New posts are listed on the left in the smallest sized thumbnails.&nbsp;\"What's Rising\" posts are displayed in the center column as large&nbsp;thumbnails, and the \"What's Hot\" posts are shown to the right, also as large thumbnails. This three-pronged approach to displaying content can help readers decide which kind of news matters to them the most -- the attention-grabbing top story, or other posts that are currently trending.</p> \n<p>Plus, we like&nbsp;that the number of shares is displayed in each post preview -- that's a great form of social proof.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"content-post__body\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen_Shot_2016-09-30_at_11.02.47_AM.png?width=671&amp;name=Screen_Shot_2016-09-30_at_11.02.47_AM.png\" style=\"width: 671px;\" width=\"671\" alt=\"Mashable Homepage.png\" title=\"Mashable Homepage.png\" /></span></p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>8.&nbsp;<a title=\"Brit + Co.\" href=\"http://www.brit.co/\">Brit + Co</a><a title=\"Brit + Co.\" href=\"http://www.brit.co/\"></a></h3> \n<p>Everything about the Brit + Co homepage says \"clean,\" \"warm,\" and \"welcoming.\" It's free of clutter, making the content more digestible, and the layout is extremely organized.</p> \n<p>We dig the seasonality of the site, too. I mean, avocado jack-o'-lanterns on the dawn of October? Adorable, and replete with a colorful, fun photo to illustrate the story's content.</p> \n<p>The subtle \"trending\" header also serves as a nice way to promote popular content, without being too in-you-face about it. Plus, with such great visuals, we took note of the nod to Pinterest -- that icon is important to include when your blog incorporates attractive imagery.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"content-post__body\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen_Shot_2016-09-30_at_11.10.58_AM.png?width=671&amp;name=Screen_Shot_2016-09-30_at_11.10.58_AM.png\" width=\"671\" alt=\"Brit+Co Blog.png\" title=\"Brit+Co Blog.png\" style=\"width: 671px;\" /></span></p> \n<a></a> \n<h3><span class=\"content-post__body\"><span class=\"content-post__body\">9.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.tescoliving.com/\">Tesco Living</a><a href=\"http://www.tescoliving.com/\"></a></span></span></h3> \n<p>We love the colorful, consistent design of Tesco Living, the blog site of British grocery chain Tesco.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Remember how we keep harping away at brand consistency? Check out the rhombus-like designs in the top banner -- that reflects the same ones that appear in Tesco's logo.</p> \n<p>What Tesco Living has achieved is a great balance of simplicity and boldness. The layout is extremely minimal, but it isn't dull. Warm and welcoming shades&nbsp;underscore each content category, and the photos add dashes of colors throughout the site.

So when a blog dedicated to life as a dog owner came across our radar, it got our attention.</p> \n<p>BarkPost, the blog of canine subscription box company BarkBox, is a great example of design for a number of reasons. First, look how easy it is to subscribe -- the call to action is right there, above the featured content. The social share icons are easily noticeable, too -- and, of course, all in the brand-matching, trustworthy blue.</p> \n<p>We also like that BarkPost draws attention to its sister companies, all of which are owned under the Bark &amp; Co portfolio of brands. But at the same time,&nbsp;the blog&nbsp;doesn't hock its own products -- rather, it serves as an informational resource to dog parents and lovers alike.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"content-post__body\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen_Shot_2016-09-30_at_11.50.59_AM.png?width=671&amp;name=Screen_Shot_2016-09-30_at_11.50.59_AM.png\" width=\"671\" alt=\"BarkPost Blog.png\" title=\"BarkPost Blog.png\" style=\"width: 671px;\" /></span></p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>15.&nbsp;<a title=\"Salvation Army\" href=\"http://www.goodwill.org/category/blog/\">Goodwill Industries International</a><a title=\"Salvation Army\" href=\"http://www.goodwill.org/category/blog/\"></a></h3> \n<p>Who says nonprofit organizations can't blog?

And, visitors can pick the type of information that matters to them the most by choosing a topic from the drop-down menu on the top right.</p> \n<p>Finally, we love that there's a collaborative call to action in the introductory text that invites readers to contribute content to the Goodwill blog. After all, the organizations&nbsp;services have reached&nbsp;37 million people -- here's a way for them to share their stories, or invite donors to write about why they chose to support Goodwill.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen_Shot_2016-09-30_at_12.19.16_PM.png?width=671&amp;name=Screen_Shot_2016-09-30_at_12.19.16_PM.png\" width=\"671\" alt=\"Goodwill Blog.png\" title=\"Goodwill Blog.png\" style=\"width: 671px;\" /></p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>16.&nbsp;<a title=\"Charity: Water\" href=\"http://www.charitywater.org/blog/\">charity: water</a><a title=\"Charity: Water\" href=\"http://www.charitywater.org/blog/\"></a></h3> \n<p>Keeping the nonprofit blogging train going is charity: water, which makes&nbsp;excellent use of&nbsp;high-quality photography.</p> \n<p>Recently, the organization redesigned its blog with a lengthy post dedicated to its 10-year anniversary.

Its blog's simple color scheme and matching fonts help to create a unified user experience from the shop to&nbsp;general content, all the while throwing in bold, colorful images to catch readers'

valuable long-term solution for increased revenue and sustainable growth, but it’s not always easy to cultivate that kind of loyalty.</p> \n<p>When I think about the brands I like best, like J. Crew, Spotify, and SoulCycle, I know I’m not a loyal brand advocate because of their products alone. I can get cheaper clothes, music, and groceries from plenty of other places. Ultimately, I’m a brand advocate because I believe in what they promote and I feel invested in their stories, like SoulCycle’s: “We aspire to inspire. We inhale intention and exhale expectation.” I relate to their brand messaging.</p> \n<p>One of the ways J. Crew, Spotify, and SoulCycle cultivate customer loyalty is through valuable content. While there are many ways to do this, <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/email\">email marketing</a> is one of the most powerful ways to reach your target audience -- if done correctly.</p> \n<p>I subscribe to J. Crew’s email list to get their “Flash Sale: Midnight” offers. I subscribe to Spotify’s newsletter to receive special promotions. And I subscribe to SoulCycle’s emails to hear about unique classes happening near me.</p> \n<p>In short, I subscribe to their emails to get value.</p> \n<p>If you’re starting from zero, building an impressive email list can feel like an impossible feat. Here, we'll cover some high-quality strategies to build an email list from scratch. Best of all, these strategies are designed to cultivate a loyal email subscriber base, so you can use your emails to attract better long-term customers.</p> \n<h2><strong>How to Build an Email List From Scratch </strong></h2> \n<h3><strong>1. Create a personalized CTA (call-to-action) for each blog or landing page. </strong></h3> \n<p>HubSpot has found personalized calls-to-action have a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/personalized-calls-to-action-convert-better-data\">42% higher view-to-submission rate</a> than calls-to-action that are the same for all visitors -- that’s almost double your potential email subscribers.</p> \n<p>It makes sense: the people who visit your blog post or web page are looking for something specific, so your CTA needs to meet those unique needs. For instance, if you’ve got a ton of traffic visiting your “List-Building Strategy” blog article, why not entice those people to subscribe to your email list by including a simple CTA like this: “Click here to download a free list-building toolkit.”</p> \n<p>Of course, personalized CTAs only work if you have the resources to create that quality content in the first place, but that process doesn’t have to be expensive or time-consuming. Instead of a toolkit, you could also offer an e-book, a fun quiz, or an exclusive article from your CEO on list-building strategies.</p> \n<p>If you offer content directly related to your visitor’s needs, your email newsletter won’t feel like a gimmicky advertisement. Instead, it will feel helpful and valuable -- key principles for a long-term customer retention plan.</p> \n<h3><strong>2. Create a pop-up or slide-in for each page of your site. </strong></h3> \n<p>A pop-up might sound initially bothersome, but I’m not talking about those early 2000 pop-up’s that promised you’d “Become a Model NOW”.</p> \n<p>Instead, I’m talking about timed pop-up ads, or onsite retargeting. After a user spends a certain amount of time on your page, she can receive a pop-up relevant to the content on that page, or to her behavior. Examples include exit pop-ups, which appear when a user tries to leave the page, or scroll pop-ups, which appear after the user scrolls a certain percentage down the page.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.optimonk.com/blog/test-results-digital-marketer-generated-2689-leads-14-days-using-onsite-retargeting/#.WzO-H9hKjOQ\">Digital Marketer conducted a case study</a> to determine the value of onsite retargeting. For one experiment in particular, Digital Marketer introduced a pop-up ad to returning visitors only, which appeared after a visitor spent 15 seconds on their site:</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/How%20to%20Build%20an%20Email%20List%20from%20Scratch%2010%20Incredibly%20Effective%20Strategies-1.png\" alt=\"\">\n</div> \n<p>Digital Marketer ensured this pop-up didn’t show up if someone came to the page from the newsletter (in which case, they were already signed up), and also didn’t pop-up on a sales page (which could interrupt someone’s purchasing decision).</p> \n<p>As you can see, Digital Marketer also took the time to offer meaningful content, a digital marketing toolbox, in their pop-up ad. With an impressive offer, your pop-up is no longer obtrusive or interruptive -- it’s simply helpful.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, their campaign generated <a href=\"https://www.optimonk.com/blog/test-results-digital-marketer-generated-2689-leads-14-days-using-onsite-retargeting/#.WzO-H9hKjOQ\">2,689 leads in two weeks, and increased their average time on page by 54%</a>. Pop-ups aren’t always gimmicky, and if done right, you’re able to appeal to your visitor with quality content when and where they need it.</p> \n<h3><strong>3. Create a timed pop-up survey. </strong></h3> \n<p>Most people don’t visit a new website and think, “Huh, so where’s the email sign-up form?” Often times, you need your viewers to feel invested in your content before you present them with a request for their emails.</p> \n<p>To build your email list, you might want to reach out to visitors on specific pages with surveys related to that content. I’m more willing to answer an “A or B” survey question if I’m already invested in the content -- it feels like a fairer trade-off.</p> \n<p>For instance, University of Alberta’s email subscriber list <a href=\"https://neilpatel.com/blog/a-little-nudge/\">grew almost 500% </a>in one year alone, thanks to a timed pop-up survey they implemented:</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/How%20to%20Build%20an%20Email%20List%20from%20Scratch%2010%20Incredibly%20Effective%20Strategies.png\" alt=\"\">\n</div> \n<p>The University of Alberta’s pop-up survey only appears after a visitor remains on a news’ page for 10 seconds. At that point, the viewers’ seen some value from the content, so ideally they’re more inclined to sign up for emails from the source.</p> \n<p>The University of Alberta’s survey pop-up is also one of the easiest forms I’ve ever seen. You enter your email and you’re done. People are often deterred from signing up when the form is too long and they don’t have the time, so a simple yes or no question might be your best bet for growing your email list.</p> \n<h3><strong>4. Use humor or sarcasm in your CTA’s “no, thanks” copy. </strong></h3> \n<p>We’re so infiltrated with “Yes or No” web offers on a daily basis, we barely see them anymore. To increase your email lists, you might want to try injecting some personality into your CTA copy.</p> \n<p>I always pause and laugh when I see a CTA with a small, “No thanks, I don’t want to lose weight,” button underneath a prominent “Yes, sign me up!” link. It reminds me there’s a person behind the button, and, while it’s meant to be a joke, it also incentivizes me to hesitate before clicking “no, thanks”. It’s easy to click “no” when the CTA is “sign up for more emails!”, but it’s a little harder to say no to losing weight or getting richer.</p> \n<p>I was reading an <a href=\"https://www.optimonk.com/\">Optimonk</a> blog post recently, and this CTA popped up:</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/How%20to%20Build%20an%20Email%20List%20from%20Scratch%2010%20Incredibly%20Effective%20Strategies-2.png\" alt=\"\">\n</div> \n<p>I was all set to click “No” without another thought, when I read the “my business isn’t important” part. It gave me pause, made me laugh, and, most importantly, made me reconsider my almost immediate decision to exit the offer.</p> \n<h3><strong>5. Describe value in your CTA. </strong></h3> \n<p>We’ve talked a lot about different formatting you might use in your CTA’s (including pop-up ads or personalized offers embedded in blog posts), but what about the language in the CTA itself? You can rely on more than humor and sarcasm to get clicks.</p> \n<p>To optimize sign-ups, ironically, you don’t want to use the words “sign up.” Who wants to “sign up” or “subscribe” to more junk emails? Instead, you want to outline the value you can offer upfront, using language like, “Download,” “Featured”, “Exclusive,” “Access.”</p> \n<p>For instance, you might write, “Download our exclusive e-book now,” and include an email subscription form, or, you might say, “Access all our exclusive offers.” Both of these CTAs make clear the value you’ll gain from providing your email address.</p> \n<p>Your web viewers need to hear how your emails can offer unique and exclusive content that isn’t already available on your website. They want to believe your company is offering something special via email, or what’s the point?</p> \n<h3><strong>6. Pitch your email newsletter on your social media accounts and email signature.</strong></h3> \n<p>You might not have a long list of email subscribers, but that doesn’t mean you don't have a network. If you have a following on Twitter, a fan base on Facebook, or businesses you communicate with via email, why not use those firm and loyal connections to build an email list?</p> \n<p>You might try pitching an email newsletter on your business’s Facebook, Twitter, or LinkedIn accounts. The people who follow you on those sites already know they like you, but they aren’t necessarily the same people who receive your newsletter. Give them the option.</p> \n<p>If you’re uncomfortable pitching your email newsletter on social media, or if you don’t have a large following on any of your accounts, you could also include a link in your email signature -- that link could go directly to your email newsletter, or it could be a link to a blog post or <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/best-landing-page-builder\">landing page</a> with email subscription CTA’s.</p> \n<p>You communicate daily with a diverse group of people via email, and when they get value from your personal emails, they might want the option to click a link and explore your company in more depth.</p> \n<h3><strong>7. Create more landing pages. </strong></h3> \n<p>HubSpot conducted research and found companies see a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33756/why-you-yes-you-need-to-create-more-landing-pages.aspx\">55% increase in leads</a> when you increase the number of landing pages from 10 to 15.</p> \n<p>It makes sense: individual and <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/landing-pages\">personalized landing pages</a> allow you to appeal to a wider demographic. Every person who visits your site needs something different, so the more landing pages you can create to answer each person’s individual concerns, the more sign-ups you’ll gain.</p> \n<p>It’s like a restaurant menu. The more you can offer to cater for specific demographics, the more customers you’ll bring in. Someone could be looking for the best gluten-free pizza, while someone else might just want some good sushi.</p> \n<h3><strong>8. Encourage everyone to sign up immediately. </strong></h3> \n<p>You want to strategically place personalized CTAs where it counts -- on landing pages and blog posts. But what about the rare, but real, visitors who want to sign up immediately?</p> \n<p>If your newsletter primarily centers around one or two topics, it’s relatively easy to create a personalized CTA -- simply write a CTA that mirrors your newsletter’s purpose, such as, “Want free SEO hacks? Sign up for our newsletter!”</p> \n<h3><strong>9. Include a CTA on your About Us page. </strong></h3> \n<p>Your About Us page is one of the most potent pages in terms of conversion potential. Think about it -- how often do you visit About Us pages for businesses you don’t care about?</p> \n<p>Ideally, your About Us page will prime visitors to want more from your business, but it might not be enough to convince them to purchase. A CTA that encourages them to sign up for a newsletter is easier to concede to than a “buy now” plea.</p> \n<h3><strong>10. Try a scroll box. </strong></h3> \n<p>Timing is everything. Your call-to-action works best if you catch visitors when they are, in fact, ready to take action.</p> \n<p>Figuring out when your visitor is ready to convert depends on your website viewers’ behavior, so you’ll want to conduct A/B testing to determine where you need to place your CTA. Does it work best towards the bottom of a blog page, when it slides out to the right, or does it get higher conversions at the beginning of the page, sliding out from the left?</p> \n<p>Ultimately, it will vary depending on your page’s content and your viewers, but a scroll box is a subtle and useful option to help you catch your viewers when they’re most ready to convert.</p> \n<p></p> \n<div>\n <a class=\"close\">&nbsp;</a>\n</div>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Flist-building&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 04 Nov 2020 12:15:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/How%20to%20Build%20an%20Email%20List%20from%20Scratch%2010%20Incredibly%20Effective%20Strategies-1.png","linkMd5":"f274b28afd8e9e2da56af561d2e4ce7a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn18@2020_4/2020/11/14/17-30-18-525_12c755005a46bc43.webp","destWidth":1138,"destHeight":964,"sourceBytes":391944,"destBytes":391944,"author":"Caroline Forsey","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/How%20to%20Build%20an%20Email%20List%20from%20Scratch%2010%20Incredibly%20Effective%20Strategies-1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn18@2020_4/2020/11/14/17-30-18-525_12c755005a46bc43.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/How%20to%20Build%20an%20Email%20List%20from%20Scratch%2010%20Incredibly%20Effective%20Strategies.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn54@2020_3/2020/11/14/17-30-23-707_a7b3d7a86b566036.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/How%20to%20Build%20an%20Email%20List%20from%20Scratch%2010%20Incredibly%20Effective%20Strategies-2.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn32@2020_3/2020/11/14/17-30-20-601_e74b34f000c8d33e.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Flist-building&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn77@2020_3/2020/11/14/17-30-23-864_833b2473234bfb1a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605375018204},{"createdTime":"2020-11-15 01:30:18","updatedTime":"2020-11-15 01:30:18","title":"The Ultimate Guide to Brand Awareness","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/brand-awareness","description":"<p>Have you ever heard people refer to themselves as “Apple people,” “Nike people,” or “Trader Joe’s” people?</p>  \n<p>This is what brand awareness can do for a brand: embed itself into consumer lifestyles and purchase habits so that they don’t have to think twice before becoming a customer — time and time again.</p> \n<p>This guide will help you better understand brand awareness, establish it among your audience, and build campaigns that allow it to continually grow and morph with your business. Let’s dive in.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Brand awareness might seem like a vague concept, and in truth, it is. For those marketers and business owners out there who like to gauge success with neat and tidy numbers, brand awareness will likely ruffle your feathers.</p> \n<a></a> \n<p>But just because it isn’t a metric that can be perfectly determined doesn’t mean it doesn’t carry value. Brand awareness is incredibly important for business success and overall marketing goals. Here’s why.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>Brand awareness fosters trust.</h3> \n<a></a> \n<p>In a world where consumers rely on <a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/HubSpot/the-hard-truth-about-marketing\">extensive research and others’ opinions</a> before making a purchase, brand trust is everything. Once a consumer bonds to your brand, they’re more likely to make repeat purchases with little to no forethought –– which then bridges the gap between trust and loyalty.</p> \n<p>Brand awareness establishes that brand trust. When you put a proverbial face to your brand name, consumers can trust easier. Brand awareness efforts give your brand a personality and outlet to be sincere, receive feedback, and tell a story. These are all ways that we, as humans, build trust with one another. The human/brand relationship isn’t any different.</p> \n<h3>Brand awareness creates association.</h3> \n<p>When you’ve had a paper cut, I bet you’ve put on a Band-Aid. When you had a pressing question, I’m sure you’ve Googled it. When you needed to make a few copies, I’m guessing that you Xeroxed them. And when you’ve packed for a nice picnic, I’m willing to bet you grabbed a Coke to drink.</p> \n<p>Am I correct? Most likely. But ... notice how the some of the words above are capitalized. These are brands, not nouns or verbs.</p> \n<p>Speaking in <i>brand-less</i> terms, Band-Aid should be referred to as bandage, Google, as a search engine, and Xerox as a copier. But it’s more fun to refer to the brand itself, even if we aren’t using their <i>specific</i> product.</p> \n<p>That’s what brand awareness does. It associates actions and products with particular brands, subconsciously encouraging us to replace common words with branded terms. And before you know it, simple paper cuts or picnics are doing the marketing for us.</p> \n<h3>Brand awareness builds brand equity.</h3> \n<p>Brand equity describes a brand’s value, which is determined by consumer experiences with and overall perception of the brand. Positive experiences and perception equal positive brand equity, and the same goes for negative notions.</p> \n<p>Here are a few valuable things that come from positive brand equity:</p> \n<ul> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Higher prices due to higher perceived value</li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A higher stock price</li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ability to expand business through product or service line extensions</li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Greater social impact due to brand name value</li> \n</ul> \n<p>How does a brand establish (and increase) brand equity? By building brand awareness and consistently promoting positive experiences with the brand. Brand awareness is the foundation of brand equity.</p> \n<p>Once a consumer is aware of a brand, they start to recognize it without assistance, seek it out to make a purchase, begin to prefer it over other similar brands, and establish a loyalty that not only spurs on other purchases but also inspires recommendations to family and friends.</p> \n<p>That, my friends, is why brand awareness is so important. It establishes trust with your customers, creates positive associations, and builds invaluable brand equity that allows your brand to become a household name and consumer staple.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>How to Establish Brand Awareness</h2> \n<a></a> \n<p>Brand awareness among your audience and the general public doesn’t happen overnight. It also doesn’t happen from a simple advertisement or marketing campaign.</p> \n<p>Strong brand awareness is a result of multiple simultaneous efforts that extend beyond trying to get paying customers.</p> \n<p>If you expect to raise awareness of your brand by running a few product advertisements on Facebook, you won’t get very far. Not only will the consumer be focused on the product (not the brand), but the ad will also lack impact beyond a simple sale.</p> \n<p>Here are some ways to establish a solid brand awareness foundation and make a lasting impact with your audience:</p> \n<h3>Be a person, not a company.</h3> \n<p>When you get to know a new friend, what do you like to discover about them? I like to learn about hobbies, passions, likes and dislikes, and more. I also pay attention to how they speak, what they like to talk about, and what stuff gets them excited.</p> \n<p>These are the traits your brand should determine and promote about itself. To leave an impact with your audience, you’ve got to define yourself as more than a company that sells <i>stuff</i>. How else would you define yourself? What words would you use if you had to introduce your brand to a new friend?</p> \n<h3>Socialize.</h3> \n<p>Introvert or extrovert, outgoing or quiet, all humans benefit from social contact and spending time with one another. It’s how we stay connected, learn new things, and become known by others.</p> \n<p>The same goes for your brand. If you only attempt to connect with others when trying to make a sale or get support, you won’t be known as anything beyond a business with a singular intention (and the same goes for a person).</p> \n<a></a> \n<p>To raise awareness of your brand, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/powerful-techniques-boost-brand-social-media-list\">you’ve got to be social</a>. Post on social media about things unrelated to your product or services. Interact with your audience by asking questions, commenting on posts, or retweeting or sharing content you like. Treat your social accounts as if you were a person trying to make friends, not a business trying to make money.</p> \n<p>Research shows that <a href=\"https://www.webershandwick.com/uploads/news/files/NA_SocialBrand_ExecSummary.pdf\">over 50% of brand reputation</a>&nbsp;comes from online sociability. Being social leads to greater awareness and simply being <i>known</i>.</p> \n<h3>Tell a narrative.</h3> \n<p><a href=\"https://academy.hubspot.com/lessons/the-power-of-storytelling\">Storytelling</a> is an incredibly powerful marketing tactic, whether you’re marketing products or promoting your brand. Why? Because it gives something real for your audience to latch onto.</p> \n<p>Crafting a narrative around your brand humanizes it and gives it depth. And weaving this said narrative into your marketing inherently markets your brand alongside your products or services.</p> \n<p>What should your narrative be about? Anything, as long as it’s true. It can be the narrative of your founder, the tale of how your business had its first product idea, or the little-engine-that-could story of how your small business made it in this big world.</p> \n<p>People like hearing stories about each other. Authenticity is impactful, and it can lead to a big boost in brand awareness.</p> \n<h3>Make sharing easy.</h3> \n<p>Whatever your industry, product offering, or marketing strategies, make it easy for your audience to share your content. This could be blog posts, sponsored content, videos, social media posts, or product pages. It doesn’t matter what it is, as long as it’s shareable.</p> \n<p>Word-of-mouth marketing is the most effective way to establish trust and familiarity among customers. If someone sees that a friend or family member is recommending a product or service, they’ll take notice of that product … and brand. Is this a brand worth exploring? Do they have other great products I can rely on? What are their social accounts like, and what do they talk about?</p> \n<p>If you make it easy to post about your stuff, consumers will raise brand awareness for you by simply clicking “Share”.</p> \n<p><em>Brand awareness is about impact.</em></p> \n<p>It’s about interacting with your audience in ways that don’t only ask for money, participation, or loyalty.</p> \n<p>Imagine if you met a new person who wanted to be your friend. If they asked for any of the above, you’d probably laugh and walk away, right? Not only is that a shallow approach to friendship, but it also leaves no lasting impact on you.</p> \n<p>The same goes for establishing brand awareness among your audience.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>How to Increase Brand Awareness</h2> \n<a></a> \n<p>What about expanding your established brand awareness and building on that strong foundation? What can you do as a brand to campaign for awareness and constantly increase it?</p> \n<p>Here are a few campaign ideas to boost your brand awareness:</p> \n<h3>Offer freemium.</h3> \n<a></a> \n<p>Freemium is a business model that offers a basic product or product line for free, only charging for any products deemed premium or enterprise-level. It’s a popular pricing strategy for software companies, like <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/crm\">HubSpot</a> and <a href=\"https://trello.com/\">Trello</a>.</p> \n<p>Offering a freemium option allows customers to get a taste of your brand and product before making a purchase. It’s a try-before-you-buy opportunity that can, technically, last forever (as opposed to a free trial period that some companies choose).</p> \n<p>It’s common to offer a freemium option with the condition that the brand’s watermark will be shown on any public-facing parts of the product or service. This makes freemium a win-win situation: The consumer gets the product for free, and the brand gets free advertising when consumers use it.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.typeform.com/\">TypeForm</a> is another great example of this. TypeForm offers a freemium option of its survey software, but customers must include a thank-you page that features the TypeForm logo and message.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/brand%20awareness-typeform.png?width=600&amp;name=brand%20awareness-typeform.png\" alt=\"brand awareness-typeform\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>Depending on your type of business and product offer, Freemium may be the best way to raise awareness of your brand among your audience.</p> \n<h3>Create free content.</h3> \n<p>Nowadays, creating content is easier than ever … which is a good thing because today’s consumers turn to the internet for any and all questions, concerns, and DIY projects.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Content is a fun way to raise awareness of your brand because it’s the easiest way to show personality and share opinions and positioning on issues — two major components that personify and humanize your brand.</p> \n<p>Content doesn’t have to be in written form, either. You can also create videos, infographics, podcasts (which we’ll cover below), and more. Sure, written content like blogs and downloadable guides are arguably the easiest, but they’re definitely not the only option.</p> \n<p>Content doesn’t have to live on just your website, either. Guest posting and sponsored content provide opportunities to get in front of new audiences and diversify the type of content you create.</p> \n<p>If your brand isn’t creating content, you might be missing out on some major brand awareness opportunities. Content provides an amazing way to authentically connect with your audience while getting your brand name in front of people.</p> \n<p>To learn more about content creation, check out our guide here.</p> \n<h3>Sponsor events.</h3> \n<p>How many festivals, concerts, fairs, and exhibitions have you attended? These types of events are typically not possible without the help of brand sponsorships. (Take a look at a t-shirt, koozie, or string backpack you likely grabbed from the event. See any brand names?)&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Sponsoring events is a surefire way to get your brand in front of hundreds, thousands, or millions of people that likely fall into your target audience. From banners to flyers to water bottles, your brand name will be <i>everywhere</i> if you sponsor an event.</p> \n<p>Sponsoring an event also allows you to pin your brand name on an event that matches your personality, interests, and passions, meaning consumers will then associate your brand with that event and its aesthetic and character.</p> \n<p>Consider <a href=\"http://www.redbull.com/\">Red Bull</a>. Red Bull is an energy drink, and without any brand awareness efforts, we’d simply consider it an energy drink. But, thankfully, Red Bull took their marketing to the extreme — literally —&nbsp;by sponsoring extreme sporting events like cliff diving and motocross. They also sponsor <a href=\"https://teamfarang.com/blogs/news/132535299-how-to-get-sponsored-by-red-bull\">athletes</a>. Now, we inherently associate Red Bull with daring and adventurous … and believe that, if we drink it, we can be the same.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/brand%20awareness-red%20bull.jpg?width=600&amp;name=brand%20awareness-red%20bull.jpg\" alt=\"brand awareness-red bull\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<h3>Give your brand a personality.</h3> \n<p>Treating your brand as a person and defining your narrative are the first steps to giving your brand a personality. The next step would be infusing this personality into your marketing efforts.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>When you market your products and services with personality, you can’t help but boost your brand awareness because your <i>brand</i> will shine right through. Sure, your consumers will take note of the pants or pasta you’re marketing, but they’ll also experience your personality through your advertising.</p> \n<p>This is a great strategy when mixing your traditional marketing campaigns with brand awareness campaigns. They don’t always have to be one in the same, but they definitely can be.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Consider Old Spice. (Did you just picture the man on the horse? I did.) Their advertisements for their hygiene products are overflowing with personality and humor, and they still mention their products throughout. The advertisement not only makes an impact on its viewers, but a mere mention of the “Old Spice man” also sends consumers back to YouTube to watch the commercial … and to the store to buy some deodorant.</p> \n<div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 100%; height: auto; position: relative; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto;\"> \n <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.07%; margin: 0;\">\n  <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe hs-fullwidth-embed\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/owGykVbfgUE\" width=\"560\" height=\"314\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n </div> \n</div> \n<h3>Produce a podcast.</h3> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.edisonresearch.com/the-infinite-dial-2020/\">More than one-third of Americans 12 and older</a> listen to podcasts regularly. There’s no doubt podcasts play an important role in our lives … and marketing efforts.</p> \n<p>Podcasts used to be a complicated process, only created by those with a studio and fancy microphone. Now, it’s easier than ever to create and release a podcast, and doing so can do wonders for your brand awareness efforts.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Why? Because podcasts, like written or visual content, provide a way to connect with your audience authentically. Instead of blatantly promoting your product or service (which we’ve agreed isn’t the best way to go about boosting brand awareness), podcasts give you the opportunity to educate, inform, entertain, or advise your audience and build trust by doing so.</p> \n<p>Here are some examples of great podcasts produced by brands you know and love:</p> \n<ul> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/lipstories/id1370728732?mt=2\">#LIPSTORIES by Sephora</a></li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/trailblazers-with-walter-isaacson/id1212045046?mt=2\">Trailblazers by Dell</a></li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/the-growth-show\">The Growth Show by HubSpot</a></li> \n</ul> \n<p>See how these brands have chosen podcast topics that relate to their 1) overall brand message and 2) products or services? Doing this helps them relate the podcast back to their brand and continue to raise awareness, too.</p> \n<p>For more information on podcasts, check out our guide here.</p> \n<p>Building and growing brand awareness is a never-ending process, just as maintaining a friendship or relationship never really ends.</p> \n<p>&nbsp;Boosting your brand awareness through campaigns gives you a chance to dabble in marketing and advertising opportunities you’d otherwise not invest in — meaning new, powerful ways to connect with your audience.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>How to Measure Brand Awareness</h2> \n<a></a> \n<p>How do you know if your brand awareness efforts are working? How do you know if you need to change direction, top the competition, or fix a crisis? Just like any other marketing metric, you measure it.</p> \n<p><em>Wait … I thought you said brand awareness couldn’t be measured!</em></p> \n<p>Aha! You’ve been listening. I appreciate that.</p> \n<p>You’re right — brand awareness can’t be measured <i>in the traditional sense</i>. But, you can still review activities and metrics that’ll help you gauge where your brand stands in terms of popularity and consumer awareness.</p> \n<p>Here are a few ways to gauge your brand awareness and learn where you can tweak your efforts:</p> \n<h3>Quantitative Brand Awareness Measures</h3> \n<p>These numbers can help you paint the overall picture of your brand awareness. To measure quantitatively, check out these metrics:</p> \n<a></a> \n<ul> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Direct traffic.</strong> Firstly, direct traffic is the result of people <i>intentionally</i> typing in your URL and visiting your website. Your direct traffic number will tell you how much your marketing is prompting people to visit your website. This is an important metric, as many consumers today discover brands through social media, advertisements, or by typing in keywords related to your brand or product. When consumers go directly to your site, it means they were aware of your brand beforehand.</li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Site traffic numbers. </strong>This number just reflects overall site traffic, which will tell you how much of the general internet population is checking out your content and spending time with your brand. It won’t quite tell you where people came from, but that doesn’t matter, because they’re aware of your brand enough to check it out.</li> \n</ul> \n<a></a> \n<ul> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Social engagement.</strong> Engagement can refer to followers, likes, retweets, comments, and more. It’s a reflection of how many people are aware of your brand and socialize with it, as well as how impactful your content is. For instance, sites like <a href=\"https://sparktoro.com/tools/sparkscore\">Sparktoro</a> can give you a specific score for your Twitter impact.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>Qualitative Brand Awareness Measures</h3> \n<p>This step is where your brand awareness “score” gets a little murky. But these tactics can still help you gauge who and how many people are aware of your brand. To measure qualitatively, try:</p> \n<ul> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Searching Google and setting up </strong><a href=\"https://www.google.com/alerts\"><strong>Google Alerts</strong></a><strong>. </strong>Doing this gets you up to speed with how your brand is being talked about online. It will alert you to any news or mentions by third-party press. As your brand grows, its internet real estate will expand beyond your website, so keep an eye on that.</li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Social listening.</strong> Social listening is monitoring <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/29437/20-free-social-media-and-brand-monitoring-tools-that-rock.aspx\">social media management tools</a> for organic mentions and engagement. Who’s tagging your brand, mentioning it in comments, or using your hashtag in their posts? These tools can help you discover that. And the more your audience is discussing your brand on social media, the more they’re aware of it.</li> \n</ul> \n<ul> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Running brand awareness surveys. </strong>This process involves getting direct feedback from your customers and audience and can be incredibly helpful with not only understanding who knows of your brand but also what they think of it. You can release surveys through <a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/\">SurveyMonkey</a> or <a href=\"https://www.typeform.com/\">TypeForm</a> and share them on social media or directly with your customers. This <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service/create-a-survey\">guide</a> will help you create and promote them.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>These quantitative and qualitative metrics will help you understand your brand awareness among your audience and the general public. It’ll never be a perfect number, but keeping your pulse on this measure will help influence campaigns and stay connected to your audience. Regardless of how you gauge brand awareness for your company, avoid these <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/mistakes-measure-brand-awareness\">common mistakes</a> when measuring brand awareness.</p> \n<h2>Over to You</h2> \n<p>Brand awareness is a powerful (albeit vague) concept that can have a major impact on your marketing efforts, consumer perception, and revenue.</p> \n<p>Follow these techniques for establishing and building awareness for your brand, and you’ll find yourself with a loyal audience that recognizes your brand among competitors, chooses your products time and time again, and recommends their friends and family do the same.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fbrand-awareness&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 13 Nov 2020 13:54:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"e93c9572e4a6842e95d82642a5e93c22","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"adecker@hubspot.com (Allie Decker)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/brand%20awareness-typeform.png?width=600&name=brand%20awareness-typeform.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn98@2020_2/2020/11/14/17-30-25-088_3e669959bf452747.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/brand%20awareness-red%20bull.jpg?width=600&name=brand%20awareness-red%20bull.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn29@2020_3/2020/11/14/17-30-22-473_849a574ad5fd82df.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fbrand-awareness&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn25@2020_3/2020/11/14/17-30-22-475_ca7d91f5884c5efe.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605375018181},{"createdTime":"2020-11-15 01:30:18","updatedTime":"2020-11-15 01:30:18","title":"The Ultimate Guide to Marketing Interview Questions From HubSpot's CMO","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/marketing-interview-questions","description":"<p><span style=\"letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: transparent;\">Alright, everyone: I'm about to let you in on a few of my best-kept interviewing secrets. </span></p> \n<p><span style=\"letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: transparent;\">In this post, I'll uncover real questions I use when interviewing candidates for inbound marketing positions and the answers I'm looking for</span><span style=\"letter-spacing: 0px;\">.</span></p> \n<p><span class=\"content-post__body\">These questions are meant to assess candidates not only for their marketing talent, but also for who they are as people.</span></p> \n<p>Keep in mind that the best candidates aren't just qualified to do the job you're trying to hire them for. You want to look for people who are also passionate about marketing, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/34234/The-HubSpot-Culture-Code-Creating-a-Company-We-Love.aspx\">fit with your culture</a>, and show potential for growth at your company.</p> \n<p>Here's a quick look into my interview approach, followed by 14 excellent interview questions I recommend adapting for your industry and hiring needs.</p> \n<p><span style=\"font-size: 2rem; font-weight: bold;\">My Interview Approach</span></p> \n<p>During interviews, I put a lot of stake into each candidate as an individual. My goal is always to find someone amazing who also has great long-term potential, no matter where they are in their career.</p> \n<p>To uncover this, I like to ask questions that get at the core of who they are, how they think about things specifically, and how they've gotten things done in the real world. I then balance these questions with case-style questions, which usually involve a hypothetical business situation, because they give the candidate an opportunity to show how they think about and work on problems.</p> \n<p>Below is a list of 14 questions that make for an effective marketing job interview, the majority of which I've asked candidates with whom I've personally gotten to meet.</p> \n<p>Keep in mind that I don’t ask <em>all</em> of these questions during a single interview. In fact, one case-style question can evolve into a discussion lasting anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes, so I often only have time to cover two or three questions during one session.</p> \n<p>I also don't limit these questions to the position levels you'll see in each section below. This list is just one reasonable way to organize your job interviews based on the average experience of an intern, coordinator, manager, and director. Depending on the candidate and the needs of the role, a question to a marketing manager candidate might be a good question to ask a marketing coordinator candidate as well.</p> \n<p>Before the interview starts, carefully choose the questions you want to use based on the person's role and background. For an inbound marketing generalist, you could ask any or all of these questions. For someone with a more specific role on a larger inbound marketing team, like a blogger, you could focus only on the questions about blogging and content creation.</p> \n<p>Learn more in the following video, and check out some of my favorite interview questions below.</p> \n<div class=\"video-container-responsive\"> \n <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed hs-responsive-embed-youtube\">\n  <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/526ooiMvDqg\" width=\"640\" height=\"380\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n </div> \n</div> \n<h2>14 Interview Questions to Ask Marketing Job Candidates</h2> \n<h3>Case-Style Interview Questions</h3> \n<h4>1. \"Draw a funnel on the whiteboard showing 10,000 visitors, 500 leads, 50 opportunities, and 10 new customers (or any other numbers you think are interesting). Now, pretend you're the CMO for the company, and you have to decide what your marketing team should do to improve on these metrics. Which areas of the funnel would you focus on, and what would you do differently to change these results?\"</h4> \n<p><strong>The Follow-Up:</strong> The follow-up here is simply pushing on the candidate's answers. Typically, they'll pick one part of the funnel to focus on. (And if they don't, I like to push them to do just that.)</p> \n<p>Once they pick one area, I ask them follow-up questions like: \"Which tactics would you think about changing?,\" \"What have you done in your past role that's worked?,\" \"Do you think our company has any unique advantages to get some leverage out of that stage of the funnel?\" I don’t just want them to tell me to \"improve the visitor to lead conversion rate\" -- they need to tell me <em>how</em>.</p> \n<p>If I have time, I'll tell them to pretend they've implemented their ideas, and I'll ask them to go back through the whole funnel and explain how they think each of those initial metrics have changed.</p> \n<p><strong>What to Look For:</strong> Everyone on the marketing team needs to be able to understand how to think about and optimize the funnel. Here's where you assess their thought process, whether they have an intuitive sense of what good and bad conversion rates are, and whether they understand how the funnel steps are connected.</p> \n<p>You'll also gain some insight into whether they understand which different tactics you can use at each step to improve that particular step. (For example, if they say the lead-to-opportunity conversion rate is bad, the right answer is <em>not</em> to write more blog articles.)</p> \n<h4>2. \"We have two potential <a title=\"designs for the homepage\" href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/34006/15-Examples-of-Brilliant-Homepage-Design.aspx\">designs for the homepage</a> of our website, but we don’t know which one to use. The CEO likes one, and the COO likes another. Half the company likes one, and the other half of the company likes the other. Which one should we use?\"</h4> \n<p><strong>The Follow-Up:</strong> This type of question should elicit a ton of questions from the candidate, like who the target audience for the homepage is. If it doesn't, then they're either making up their answer or don't have enough knowledge to address the situation. Follow up by answering their questions with hypotheticals and seeing how they work through the problem.</p> \n<p>If they do pick one side or the other and give you a reason, ask them what the goals are for the homepage. Then, ask them how they'd determine which homepage meets those goals best. From there, tell them that Homepage A performed well based on one of the criteria, and Homepage B performed well based on another one of the criteria. This way, you can assess how they make choices when it's not possible to get data that's 100% conclusive, and they have to choose between two, imperfect variations.</p> \n<p><strong>What to Look For:</strong> While it might seem like this question is all about design, what you're really doing is understanding how candidates approach a conflict of interest. Do they care what each of these people think, or do they go to the data for their answers, such as through A/B testing, user testing, and customer interviews. The best candidates introduce logic and marketing methodology into their answers, while removing opinions. I also like when candidates say you should be constantly tweaking and improving the homepage, rather than always doing a complete redesign every nine or 18 months.</p> \n<h4>3. \"Let's say you have an Excel spreadsheet with 10,000 leads from a few months back -- long enough that those leads' sales cycle has passed. The file contains information about each lead, like their industry, title, company size, and what they did to become a lead (like downloading an ebook). Also in the file is whether they closed as a customer and how much their order was for. Can you use this information to create a lead score? How would you do it?\"</h4> \n<p><em><strong>Note: </strong>I often start this question by simply asking, “How should you create a lead score?” This is how I sort out the people who don't take a data-driven approach. Folks who answer, “You create a lead score by talking to the sales team and then assigning five or ten points to each of the criteria they say they want” are actually wrong. That is not <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/lead-scoring-instructions\">a data-driven approach to lead scoring</a>, and it is way too simplistic to work effectively in most cases.</em></p> \n<p><strong>The Follow-Up:</strong> Most people will answer by talking about \"looking at the data\" and \"sorting the data.\" Push them to tell you how they'd do that in Excel (or another program if they prefer something else). It's not practical to just \"look\" at the data when you have 10,000 rows -- you need to use statistical analysis.</p> \n<p>They also might zone in on one factor, perhaps industry, all alone. If they do that, you should ask them what they would say if the small companies in one industry are good leads, but the big companies in another industry are also good leads? Basically, just keep pushing them until they're at a loss for what to do next.</p> \n<p><strong>What to Look For:</strong> This case-style question is meant to test a candidate's quantitative abilities, and I'd only ask it for people applying for certain marketing roles (like operations). Here, I'm trying to figure out how the candidate thinks about analyzing data and what their sophistication level is around data.</p> \n<p>Most people don't get very far and are either unwilling or unable to look at more than one variable at a time, or understand how to analyze a lot of data in a simple way. At a minimum, you want to find candidates who:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Look at the leads who closed in one group and compare them to the leads who did not close</li> \n <li>Look at <a title=\"multiple variables\" href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33381/Lead-Scoring-13-Criteria-You-Should-Be-Using-to-Grade-Leads.aspx\">multiple variables</a> at a time</li> \n <li>Use statistical functions in Excel or another program to do that, like summary tables, pivot tables, and so on</li> \n</ul> \n<p>If you find someone who starts making a coherent argument about why you might want to use logistic regression, factor or cluster analysis, actuarial science, or stochastic modeling to figure this out ... refer them to me.</p> \n<h3>Marketing Internship Interview Questions</h3> \n<h4>4. \"What is one of your hobbies? How do you do it?\"</h4> \n<p>This question will help you assess a candidate's ability to explain a concept they know intimately to someone who isn't as familiar with it. If their hobby is training for a marathon, ask them what advice they'd give you if you woke up one day deciding you wanted to train for a marathon. Are they able to communicate it clearly?</p> \n<p>One candidate taught me how to make tagliatelle, which is hand-cut Italian pasta. She gave me the full run-down on how you make the noodles, how you form them and cut them, and which ingredients go into the sauce. She relayed the step-by-step process to me in a way that was very clear and understandable. I felt like I could've gone home and made tagliatelle myself. Not only did this tell me she knows how to convey information clearly, but it also gave me insight into her personality and interests.</p> \n<h4>5. \"What brands do you like or follow on social media and why?\"</h4> \n<p>This is another casual but useful question, as it can tell you both about a candidate's personal interests and how they perceive marketing content on social media. The best answers go further than which companies a candidate likes buying from -- they indicate why he or she trusts certain companies, what about their content strategy appeals to the candidate, and what specifically about those companies the candidate looks up to (and maybe wants to emulate in their own work).</p> \n<p>If you need a candidate to elaborate, follow up by asking them to describe a post from a brand they like or follow, and what made that post so memorable to them.</p> \n<h3>Marketing Coordinator Interview Questions</h3> \n<h4>6. \"What do you read, and how do you consume information?\"</h4> \n<p>Marketing is changing constantly at a rapid pace -- so anyone in a marketing role needs to know how to stay on top of and adapt to these changes. Do they know where to look for industry news? Are they familiar with and subscribed to<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/top-50-marketing-blogs-on-the-internet\"> top marketing blogs</a>? What do they do when they see a change has taken place, like when Google updates their algorithm?</p> \n<h4>7. \"What's an example of a lead-generating campaign you'd be excited to work on here?\"</h4> \n<p>Not every marketing campaign you run generates the same type or quality of leads. This is what makes this question so interesting. It's a chance for you to see how a marketing candidate thinks about the buyer's journey and what that journey should look like in your company.</p> \n<p>If you do pose this question to a candidate, don't expect him or her to know exactly how your business generates its leads. The ideal answer simply demonstrates an awareness of your customer and perhaps some on-the-spot brainstorming the candidate might be asked to participate in while on the job.</p> \n<p>Expect follow-up questions from the interviewee, too, especially if you pose this question to a more experienced candidate. For example, they might ask how qualified the leads should be, or how leads are scored as a result of this hypothetical campaign. The specific parameters matter less than the follow-up question itself -- a positive sign of an analytical marketer.</p> \n<h4>8. \"What are three components of a successful inbound or digital marketing strategy?\"</h4> \n<p>There's no \"right\" answer to this question -- a digital marketing strategy thrives on more than three things -- but certain answers show the candidate is up to date on how businesses attract and delight their customers today.</p> \n<p>\"A Facebook page,\" for instance, isn't a wrong answer, but it doesn't give you context around how a business would use this page in their marketing strategy. Here are a few sample answers to this interview question that are on the right track:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>A blog with calls to action (CTAs), landing pages for website visitors to download more content, and a defined social media strategy.</li> \n <li>An SEO strategy, website chat, and an analytics tool to track campaign performance.</li> \n <li>&nbsp;Buyer personas, a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/34212/how-to-create-a-service-level-agreement-sla-for-better-sales-marketing-alignment.aspx\">Marketing and Sales Service Level Agreement</a>, and a customer success strategy.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>You won't learn everything about a candidate from just these terms and phrases. But you should listen for them as the candidate responds -- and expect more sophisticated answers if you pose this question to managers or directors.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, the value you place on each of these inbound marketing components will depend on how important they are to your business and what the candidate would focus on as your employee. Before asking this question to anyone you interview, talk to your team and define your marketing strategy. Otherwise, you won't have an accurate measure on which to evaluate a candidate's answer.</p> \n<h3>Interview Questions for Marketing Manager</h3> \n<h4><strong>9. \"Why do you love marketing?\"</strong></h4> \n<p>Or, \"Which aspects of our business are you passionate about?\" You want to hire someone who's both qualified <em>and</em> has the desire to do the work. Otherwise, why would they work for you instead of the company next door?</p> \n<p>Part of their answer will lie in their body language and enthusiasm. The other part will lie in how concrete their answer is. Get at the details by asking a follow-up question, like: \"Let's say you're at home, kicking around, and doing something related to marketing. What is it that you're doing?\" Perhaps they're reading their five favorite marketing sites, or analyzing traffic patterns of websites for fun, or writing in their personal blog, or optimizing their LinkedIn profile. Whatever it is, you want to be sure they're deeply passionate about the subject matter you'd hire them for.</p> \n<h4><strong>10. \"Between videos, ebooks, blog articles, photos, podcasts, webinars, SlideShare, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Pinterest ... there's a lot of potential content our team should produce for inbound marketing. How do we do it all?\"</strong></h4> \n<p>The wisest candidates know you should<em> not</em> do it all, but rather, you should start with the content that's most important to your prospects and customers. They should also have a plan for talking to customers and prospects by way of interviews or surveys to figure out <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/which-social-networks-should-you-focus-on\">which social networks they use</a> and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/lead-gen-content-ideas\">which types of content</a> they prefer.</p> \n<h4><strong>11. \"Let’s pretend we have very convincing data that shows none of our potential customers use social media. Should we still do it? Why?\"</strong></h4> \n<p>Look for candidates who understand that being successful in social media is important even if your customers aren't there today. Here are a few reasons qualified candidates might cite:</p> \n<ul> \n <ul> \n  <li>Your customers will be there in the future, so you should get started now.</li> \n  <li>You'll gain industry clout. After all, journalists and influencers in your industry are probably using social media -- and it's important for them to follow you <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/31146/Why-You-Need-Social-Media-Followers-Who-Won-t-Ever-Buy.aspx\">even if they don't ever become customers</a>.</li> \n  <li>Social media activity <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33662/A-Crystal-Clear-Explanation-of-How-Social-Media-Influences-SEO.aspx\">impacts your organic search presence</a>, helping your content rank higher in search engines.</li> \n  <li>You'll have more control over your online presence.</li> \n  <li>Your competitors are likely using social media.</li> \n  <li>It may cost less to generate customers via social media.</li> \n </ul> \n</ul> \n<h3>Marketing Director Interview Questions</h3> \n<h4><strong>12. \"We have a new product coming out in three months. What would you do to launch it?\"</strong></h4> \n<p>This'll show you how well a candidate understands all the different tactics of inbound marketing and <a title=\"how to tie them together into a holistic plan\" href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/run-an-inbound-marketing-campaign\">how to tie them together into a holistic plan</a>. It'll also give you insight into how creative they are and whether they can come up with new and interesting ways to do marketing.</p> \n<h4><strong>13. \"Our CEO wants you to evaluate our blog. What would you say?\"</strong></h4> \n<p>Before giving you an answer, the best candidates will come back and ask you about the blog's metrics, how many leads and customers it generates, what the goals are for it, how much you're investing in it, and so on. This is also a great way to test whether they actually prepared for the interview by reading your blog.</p> \n<h4>14. \"What's the main relationship between marketing and sales?\"</h4> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2017/05/09/are-your-sales-and-marketing-teams-in-a-rivalry/#37219e289e60\">relationship between Marketing and Sales</a> is known for its unrest (Sales wants better leads from Marketing, and Marketing wants Sales to close more, faster).&nbsp;</p> \n<p><span>Similar to question #8, there's no right answer here, but there are answers you should listen for. \"M</span>arketers are the lead generators and salespeople are the lead closers\" isn't necessarily wrong, but the candidate who ends his/her answer here might not be someone who can align both departments around a single, unified approach.</p> \n<p>The best answers describe the responsibilities that Sales and Marketing have to each other, and the duties each commits to as part of this partnership. They have a plan for forging consensus on what makes leads marketing-qualified versus sales-qualified, creating a shared Service Level Agreement with agreed-upon metrics, and using content at different points in the marketing and sales funnel to turn strangers into customers.</p> \n<h2>The Candidate's Follow-Up</h2> \n<p>Most candidates know to follow up with each of their interviewers in the form of a thank-you note or email. But part of my assessment is the depth at which candidates follow up with me.</p> \n<p>The most impressive follow-ups are the thoughtful ones, where candidates call upon details of our discussion to show they're really engaged in the interview process. Perhaps they did more concrete thinking about a specific question I asked, and they send a long email including research on a question they don't think they nailed. Many times, they'll send me a light strategy document with ideas and/or research on something we talked about. These candidates tend to stand out.</p> \n<p>Well, the cat's out of the bag. You'll have to use these marketing interview questions as a basis to create your own, similar questions that are relevant to your industry and hiring needs. Good luck, and happy hiring!</p> \n<p>Want more interview tips?

What actually matters? <a href=\"https://academy.hubspot.com/courses/business-analytics?utm_source=marketing_blog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=business_analytics_course\">How do you visualize and analyze the data</a> so you can extract insights and actionable information?</p> \n<p><span class=\"content-post__body\">M</span>ore importantly, how can you make reporting more efficient when you're busy working on multiple projects at once?</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>One of the struggles that slows down my own reporting and analysis is understanding what types of graphs to use -- and why. That's because choosing the wrong visual aid or simply defaulting to the most common type of data visualization could cause confusion with the viewer or lead to mistaken data interpretation.</p> \n<p>To create charts that clarify and provide the right canvas for analysis, you should first understand the reasons why you might need a chart. In this post, I'll cover five questions to ask yourself when choosing a chart for your data.</p> \n<p>Then, I'll give an overview of 14 different types of charts you have at your disposal.</p> \n<h2>5 Questions to Ask When Deciding Which Type of Chart to Use</h2> \n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 22px; line-height: 1.5; background-color: transparent;\">1. Do you want to compare values?</span></h3> \n<p>Charts are perfect for comparing one or many value sets, and they can easily show the low and high values in the data sets. To create a comparison chart, use these types of graphs:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Column</li> \n <li>Mekko</li> \n <li>Bar</li> \n <li>Pie</li> \n <li>Line</li> \n <li>Scatter Plot</li> \n <li>Bullet</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>2. Do you want to show the composition of something?</h3> \n<p>Use this type of chart to show how individual parts make up the whole of something, such as the device type used for mobile visitors to your website or total sales broken down by sales rep.</p> \n<p>To show composition, use these charts:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Pie</li> \n <li>Stacked Bar</li> \n <li>Mekko</li> \n <li>Stacked Column</li> \n <li>Area</li> \n <li>Waterfall</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>3. Do you want to understand the distribution of your data?</h3> \n<p>Distribution charts help you to understand outliers, the normal tendency, and the range of information in your values.</p> \n<p>Use these charts to show distribution:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Scatter Plot</li> \n <li>Mekko</li> \n <li>Line</li> \n <li>Column</li> \n <li>Bar</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>4. Are you interested in analyzing trends in your data set?</h3> \n<p>If you want to know more information about how a data set performed during a specific time period, there are specific chart types that do extremely well.</p> \n<p>You should choose a:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Line</li> \n <li>Dual-Axis Line</li> \n <li>Column</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>5. Do you want to better understand the relationship between value sets?</h3> \n<p>Relationship charts are suited to showing how one variable relates to one or numerous different variables. You could use this to show how something positively effects, has no effect, or negatively effects another variable.</p> \n<p>When trying to establish the relationship between things, use these charts:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Scatter Plot</li> \n <li>Bubble</li> \n <li>Line</li> \n</ul> \n<h2>14 Different Types of Graphs and Charts for Presenting Data</h2> \n<p>To better understand each chart and how they can be used, here's an overview of each type of chart.</p> \n<h3>1. Column Chart</h3> \n<p>A column chart is used to show a comparison among different items, or it can show a comparison of items over time. You could use this format to see the revenue per landing page or customers by close date.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Agency_Post/Blog_Images/DataHero_Customers_by_Close_Date.png?width=669&amp;name=DataHero_Customers_by_Close_Date.png\" alt=\"Column chart - customers by close date\" title=\"Column chart - customers by close date\" width=\"669\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 669px;\"></p> \n<h4>Design Best Practices for Column Charts:</h4> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Use consistent colors</strong> throughout the chart, selecting accent colors to highlight meaningful data points or changes over time.</li> \n <li><strong>Use horizontal labels</strong> to improve readability.</li> \n <li><strong>Start the y-axis at 0</strong> to appropriately reflect the values in your graph.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>2. Bar Graph</h3> \n<p>A bar graph, basically a horizontal column chart, should be used to avoid clutter when one data label is long or if you have more than 10 items to compare. This type of visualization can also be used to display negative numbers.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Agency_Post/Blog_Images/DataHero_Customers_by_Role.png?width=669&amp;name=DataHero_Customers_by_Role.png\" alt=\"Bar chart - customers by role\" title=\"Bar chart - customers by role\" width=\"669\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 669px;\"></p> \n<h4>Design Best Practices for Bar Graphs:</h4> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Use consistent colors</strong> throughout the chart, selecting accent colors to highlight meaningful data points or changes over time.</li> \n <li><strong>Use horizontal labels</strong> to improve readability.</li> \n <li><strong>Start the y-axis at 0</strong> to appropriately reflect the values in your graph.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>3. Line Graph</h3> \n<p>A line graph reveals trends or progress over time and can be used to show many different categories of data. You should use it when you chart a continuous data set.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Agency_Post/Blog_Images/DataHero_Average_Days_to_Close_by_Date_Became_SQL.png?width=669&amp;name=DataHero_Average_Days_to_Close_by_Date_Became_SQL.png\" alt=\"Line chart - avg days to close\" title=\"Line chart - avg days to close\" width=\"669\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 669px;\"></p> \n<h4>Design Best Practices for Line Graphs:</h4> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Use solid lines only.</strong></li> \n <li><strong>Don't plot more than four lines</strong> to avoid visual distractions.</li> \n <li><strong>Use the right height</strong> so the lines take up roughly 2/3 of the y-axis' height.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>4. Dual Axis Chart</h3> \n<p>A dual axis chart allows you to plot data using two y-axes and a shared x-axis. It's used with three data sets, one of which is based on a continuous set of data and another which is better suited to being grouped by category. This should be used to visualize a correlation or the lack thereof between these three data sets.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Agency_Post/Blog_Images/DataHero_Revenue_by_Number_of_New_Customers_by_Date.png?width=669&amp;name=DataHero_Revenue_by_Number_of_New_Customers_by_Date.png\" alt=\"Dual axis chart - revenue by new customers\" title=\"Dual axis chart - revenue by new customers\" width=\"669\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 669px;\"></p> \n<h4>Design Best Practices for Dual Axis Charts:</h4> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Use the y-axis on the left side for the primary variable</strong> because brains are naturally inclined to look left first.</li> \n <li><strong>Use different graphing styles</strong> to illustrate the two data sets, as illustrated above.</li> \n <li><strong>Choose contrasting colors</strong> for the two data sets.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>5. Area Chart</h3> \n<p>An area chart is basically a line chart, but the space between the x-axis and the line is filled with a color or pattern. It is useful for showing part-to-whole relations, such as showing individual sales reps' contribution to total sales for a year. It helps you analyze both overall and individual trend information.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Agency_Post/Blog_Images/DataHero_Users_by_Creation_Date_and_Life_Cycle_Stage_1.png?width=669&amp;name=DataHero_Users_by_Creation_Date_and_Life_Cycle_Stage_1.png\" alt=\"Area chart - users by lifecycle stage\" title=\"Area chart - users by lifecycle stage\" width=\"669\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 669px;\"></p> \n<h4>Design Best Practices for Area Charts:</h4> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Use transparent colors</strong> so information isn't obscured in the background.</li> \n <li><strong>Don't display more than four categories</strong> to avoid clutter.</li> \n <li><span class=\"content-post__body\">Organize highly variable data at the top of the chart to <strong>make it easy to read.</strong></span></li> \n</ul> \n<h3>6. Stacked Bar Chart</h3> \n<p>This should be used to compare many different items and show the composition of each item being compared.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Agency_Post/Blog_Images/DataHero_When_MQLs_become_SQLs.png?width=669&amp;name=DataHero_When_MQLs_become_SQLs.png\" alt=\"Stacked bar chart - mqls to sqls\" title=\"Stacked bar chart - mqls to sqls\" width=\"669\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 669px;\"></p> \n<h4>Design Best Practices for Stacked Bar Graphs:</h4> \n<ul> \n <li><span class=\"content-post__body\">Best used to illustrate <strong>part-to-whole relationships.</strong></span></li> \n <li><span class=\"content-post__body\">Use <strong>contrasting colors</strong> for greater clarity.</span></li> \n <li><span class=\"content-post__body\"><strong>Make chart scale large enough</strong> to view group sizes in relation to one another.</span></li> \n</ul> \n<h3>7. Mekko Chart</h3> \n<p>Also known as a marimekko chart, this type of graph can compare values, measure each one's composition, and show how your data is distributed across each one.</p> \n<p>It's similar to a stacked bar, except the mekko's x-axis is used to capture another dimension of your values --&nbsp;<span>rather than time progression, like column charts often do.</span> In the graphic below, the x-axis compares each city to one another.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Bar%20Mekko%20Chart.png?width=600&amp;name=Bar%20Mekko%20Chart.png\" alt=\"Mekko chart - world's largest asset managers\" title=\"Mekko chart - world's largest asset managers\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Image via <a href=\"https://www.mekkographics.com/portfolio-item/deal-profile/\">Mekko Graphics</a></span></p> \n<h4>Design Best Practices for Mekko Charts:</h4> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Vary you bar heights</strong> if the portion size is an important point of comparison.</li> \n <li><strong>Don't include too many composite values</strong> within each bar. you might want to reevaluate how to present your data if you have a lot.&nbsp;</li> \n <li><strong>Order your bars</strong> from left to right in such a way that exposes a relevant trend or message.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>8. Pie Chart</h3> \n<p>A pie chart shows a static number and how categories represent part of a whole -- the composition of something. A pie chart represents numbers in percentages, and the total sum of all segments needs to equal 100%.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Agency_Post/Blog_Images/DataHero_Customers_by_Role_in_Company.png?width=669&amp;name=DataHero_Customers_by_Role_in_Company.png\" alt=\"Pie chart - customers by role\" title=\"Pie chart - customers by role\" width=\"669\" style=\"width: 669px;\"></p> \n<h4>Design Best Practices for Pie Charts:</h4> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Don't illustrate too many categories</strong> to ensure differentiation between slices.</li> \n <li>Ensure that the slice values <strong>add up to 100%.</strong></li> \n <li><strong>Order slices</strong> according to their size.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>9. Scatter Plot Chart</h3> \n<p>A scatter plot or scattergram chart will show the relationship between two different variables or it can reveal the distribution trends. It should be used when there are many different data points, and you want to highlight similarities in the data set. This is useful when looking for outliers or for understanding the distribution of your data.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Agency_Post/Blog_Images/scatter-plot-customer-happines.png?width=669&amp;name=scatter-plot-customer-happines.png\" alt=\"Scatter plot chart - customer happiness by response time\" title=\"Scatter plot chart - customer happiness by response time\" width=\"669\" style=\"width: 669px;\"></p> \n<h4>Design Best Practices for Scatter Plots:</h4> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Include more variables</strong>, such as different sizes, to incorporate more data.</li> \n <li><strong>Start y-axis at 0</strong> to represent data accurately.</li> \n <li>If you use <strong>trend lines</strong>, only use a maximum of two to make your plot easy to understand.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>10. Bubble Chart</h3> \n<p>A bubble chart is similar to a scatter plot in that it can show distribution or relationship. There is a third data set, which is indicated by the size of the bubble or circle.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Agency_Post/Blog_Images/bubble-chart.png?width=669&amp;name=bubble-chart.png\" alt=\"Bubble chart - hours spent online by age and gender\" title=\"Bubble chart - hours spent online by age and gender\" width=\"669\" style=\"width: 669px;\"></p> \n<h4>Design Best Practices for Bubble Charts:</h4> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Scale bubbles according to area</strong>, not diameter.</li> \n <li>Make sure <strong>labels are clear and visible.</strong></li> \n <li><span class=\"content-post__body\"><strong>Use circular shapes</strong> only.</span></li> \n</ul> \n<h3>11. Waterfall Chart</h3> \n<p>A waterfall chart should be used to show how an initial value is affected by intermediate values -- either positive or negative -- and resulted in a final value. This should be used to reveal the composition of a number. An example of this would be to showcase how overall company revenue is influenced by different departments and leads to a specific profit number.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Agency_Post/Blog_Images/waterfall-chart.png?width=669&amp;name=waterfall-chart.png\" alt=\"Waterfall chart - product profit analysis\" title=\"Waterfall chart - product profit analysis\" width=\"669\" style=\"width: 669px;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><em>Chart via <a href=\"http://baansconsulting.com/?p=2303\">Baans Consulting</a></em></span></p> \n<h4>Design Best Practices for <span class=\"content-post__body\">Waterfall Charts</span>:</h4> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Use contrasting colors</strong> to highlight differences in data sets.</li> \n <li>Choose warm colors to indicate increases and cool colors to indicate decreases.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>12. Funnel Chart</h3> \n<p>A funnel chart shows a series of steps and the completion rate for each step. This can be used to track the sales process or the conversion rate across a series of pages or steps.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Agency_Post/Blog_Images/DataHero_Marketing_Funnel.png?width=669&amp;name=DataHero_Marketing_Funnel.png\" alt=\"Funnel chart - marketing funnel process\" title=\"Funnel chart - marketing funnel process\" width=\"669\" style=\"width: 669px;\"></p> \n<h4>Design Best Practices for Funnel Charts:</h4> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Scale the size of each section</strong> to accurately reflect the size of the data set.</li> \n <li>Use <strong>contrasting colors</strong> or <strong>one color</strong> in gradating hues, from darkest to lightest as the size of the funnel decreases.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>13. Bullet Graph</h3> \n<p>A bullet graph reveals progress toward a goal, compares this to another measure, and provides context in the form of a rating or performance.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Agency_Post/Blog_Images/bullet-graph3.png?width=500&amp;name=bullet-graph3.png\" alt=\"Bullet graph - new customers\" title=\"Bullet graph - new customers\" width=\"500\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 500px;\"></p> \n<h4>Design Best Practices for Bullet Graphs:</h4> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Use contrasting colors</strong> to highlight how the data is progressing.</li> \n <li><strong>Use one color</strong> in different shades to gauge progress.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>14.

Starbucks is more than a coffee. Ray-Ban is more than a pair of sunglasses. Glossier is more than a tube of concealer.</p> \n<p>Interacting with these products provide <em>experiences</em>, and we buy them with that experience in mind. Better yet, the companies that create and market them know exactly the experience they want you to have when you make (or consider) a purchase. <strong>That’s why they create a brand.</strong></p> \n<p>From the language in their Instagram caption to the color palette on their latest billboard to the material used in their packaging, companies who create strong brands know that their brand needs to live <em>everywhere</em>. They know their names extend far beyond the label.</p> \n<p>The result? These brands are known, loved, and chosen out of a long lineup of options.</p> \n<p>Who doesn’t want that? I know I do. That’s why we built this guide — to equip you to create and manage a strong brand that’ll help your business be admired, remembered, and preferred.</p> \n<p>Use the links below to jump ahead to sections of interest, and don’t forget to bookmark this guide for later.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p> \n<h2>What’s a brand?</h2> \n<p>Before I dive into the importance of branding and how to build a brand, let’s go back to basics: What is a brand?</p> \n<p>A <strong>brand</strong> is a feature or set of features that distinguish one organization from another. A brand is typically comprised of a name, tagline, logo or symbol, design, brand voice, and more. It also refers to the overall experience a customer undergoes when interacting with a business — as a shopper, customer, social media follower, or mere passerby.<a></a></p> \n<h2>What is branding?</h2> \n<p><strong>Branding</strong> is the process of researching, developing, and applying a distinctive feature or set of features to your organization so that consumers can begin to associate your brand with your products or services.</p> \n<p>Branding is an iterative process and requires getting in touch with the heart of your customers and your business. It’s important for a variety of reasons — I dive into these next.<a></a></p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Branding <strong>can be the deciding factor for consumers</strong> when they make a purchase decision. In <a href=\"https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/news/2015/understanding-the-power-of-a-brand-name.html\">a 2015 global Nielsen survey</a>, almost 60% of shoppers said they actively buy from brands they know, and 21% said they bought a product because they liked the brand.</p> \n<p>Branding <strong>gives your business an identity</strong> beyond its product or service. It gives consumers something to relate to and connect with.</p> \n<p>Branding <strong>makes your business memorable</strong>. It’s the face of your company and helps consumers distinguish your business <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/branding#work\">across every medium (which I discuss later)</a>.</p> \n<p>Branding <strong>supports your marketing </strong>and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/advertising\">advertising efforts</a>. It helps your promotion pack that extra punch with added recognition and impact.</p> \n<p>Branding <strong>brings your employees pride</strong>. When you brand your company, you’re not only giving your business identity, you’re also creating a reputable, highly-regarded workplace. Strong branding brings in strong employees.<a></a></p> \n<h3>Branding Terms to Know</h3> \n<p>Here are some other brand-related buzzwords you should know. They further demonstrate the importance and value of branding your business.</p> \n<h4>Brand awareness</h4> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/brand-awareness\">Brand awareness</a> refers to how familiar the general public and your target audience is with your brand. High brand awareness leads to brands being referred to as “trending,” “buzzworthy, or “popular.” Brand awareness is important because consumers can’t consider purchasing from your brand if they’re not aware of it.</p> \n<p><em><span class=\"emoji\"><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/emojis\">👉🏼</a>&nbsp;</span>Strong branding makes your business known.</em></p> \n<h4>Brand extension</h4> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/brand-extensions\">Brand extensions</a> are when companies “extend” their brand to develop new products in new industries and markets. Consider <a href=\"http://powerequipment.honda.com/lawn-mowers\">Honda lawn mowers</a> or <a href=\"https://www.macys.com/shop/for-the-home/martha-stewart-bedding-bath?id=60363\">Martha Stewart bedding</a>. Brand extensions allow companies (or individuals) to leverage brand awareness and equity to create more revenue streams and diversify product lines.</p> \n<p><em><em><span class=\"emoji\">👉🏼</span></em> Strong branding brings in more money.</em></p> \n<h4>Brand identity</h4> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/agency/develop-brand-identity\">Brand identity</a> is the personality of your business and the promise you make to your customers. It’s what you want your customers to walk away with after they interact with your brand. <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/34238/the-marketer-s-guide-to-developing-a-strong-brand-identity.aspx\">Your brand identity</a> is typically comprised of your values, how you communicate your product or service, and what you want people to feel when they interact with it.</p> \n<p><em><em><span class=\"emoji\">👉🏼</span></em>&nbsp;Strong branding gives your business more than a name.</em></p> \n<h4>Brand management</h4> \n<p>Brand management refers to the process of creating and maintaining your brand. It includes managing the tangible elements of your brand (style guide, packaging, color palette) and the intangible elements (how it's perceived by your target audience and customer base). Your brand is a living, breathing asset, and it should be managed as such.</p> \n<p><em><em><span class=\"emoji\">👉🏼</span></em>&nbsp;Strong branding requires consistent upkeep.</em></p> \n<h4>Brand recognition</h4> \n<p>Brand recognition is how well a consumer (ideally in your target audience) can recognize and identify your brand <em>without</em> seeing your business name — through your logo, tagline, jingle, packaging, or advertising. This concept goes hand-in-hand with <em>brand recall</em>, which is the ability to think of a brand without any visual or auditory identifiers.</p> \n<p><em><em><span class=\"emoji\">👉🏼</span></em> Strong branding keeps your business top-of-mind.</em></p> \n<p><strong>Real-life brand example</strong>: Want to test your brand knowledge?

Do you deliver on your marketing promises? Do your salespeople and customer service go above and beyond? These things can create trust among your customers, which is important in a world where <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/1597/confidence-institutions.aspx\">a mere 25% of people</a> feel confident in large businesses.</p> \n<p><em><em><em><span class=\"emoji\">👉🏼</span></em></em>&nbsp;Strong branding builds trust with your customers.</em></p> \n<h4>Brand valuation</h4> \n<p>Brand valuation is the commercial valuation of your brand derived from consumer perception, recognition, and trust. This concept goes hand-in-hand with <em>brand equity</em>. A powerful brand can make your business invaluable to investors, shareholders, and potential buyers.</p> \n<p><em><em><em><span class=\"emoji\">👉🏼</span></em></em>&nbsp;Strong branding increases your business’s value.</em></p> \n<p><em>Want to build an effective, measurable brand?

So, grab a notebook and jot down ideas as you move through this section. Recognize that branding is an iterative process, so you might be repeating some of these steps as you brainstorm and build your brand.</p> \n<h3>1. Determine your target audience</h3> \n<p>Branding leads to awareness, recognition, trust, and revenue. We’ve talked about that. But let’s take a step back and understand where those stem from: consumers. And not just any consumers — your target audience and customers.</p> \n<p>If your brand doesn’t resonate with your audience, it won’t lead to that awareness, recognition, trust, and revenue. That’s where <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/market-research-buyers-journey-guide\">target market research</a> comes in.</p> \n<p>Before pressing pen to paper (or cursor to digital document), you must understand to whom your branding will be speaking. Who does your product serve? Who is your ideal customer? Why did you create your business in the first place?</p> \n<p>What you learn about your <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/target-market\">target market</a> and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/buyer-persona-research\">buyer personas</a> will influence your branding decisions down the line, so make this step your first priority.</p> \n<pre class=\"gutter-right\"></pre> \n<p><em><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/persona-templates?hubs_post-cta=pillar_allphrase\">Download our free Persona Templates to easily organize your target audience research and strengthen your marketing</a><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/persona-templates\">.</a></em></p> \n<h3>2. Establish your mission statement</h3> \n<p>Let’s return to a question I asked in the previous step: Why did you create your business? Answering this will help you build your mission statement, which defines your purpose and passion as an organization.</p> \n<p>Before you can craft a brand that your audience recognizes, values, and trusts, you must be able to communicate the purpose that your business provides. Then, every part of your brand (logo, tagline, imagery, voice, and personality) can reflect that <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/inspiring-company-mission-statements\">mission and vision</a>.</p> \n<p>Your mission statement is a building block of your <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/brand-manifesto\">brand manifesto</a>, which encompasses why your organization exists and why people should care about your brand.</p> \n<p><em>Download our free guide to <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/define-mission-and-vision-statements?hubs_post-cta=pillar_kwphrase\">Defining Inspiring Mission and Vision Statements</a> and learn the ins-and-outs of two of the most valuable strategic planning elements for businesses.</em></p> \n<h3>3. Define your unique values, qualities, and benefits</h3> \n<p>There are probably lots of businesses in your industry and niche. It’s easy to focus on your competition (and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/competitor-analysis-guide\">there’s a time and place for competitive analysis</a>), but, for now, let’s focus on you.</p> \n<p>What’s one thing that your business has that no one else can mimic (er, legally)? <strong>Your brand.</strong></p> \n<p>Because of that, you must ensure that your brand is comprised of and inspired by elements that are solely yours: the values, benefits, and qualities that make your company unique.</p> \n<p>Take a moment to jot down a list of what <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/agency/positioning-agency-branding\">sets your business apart from others</a>. I’m not talking about product features (like appearance, components, or capabilities); I’m referring to how your products or services improve lives and contribute to success.</p> \n<p><strong>Real-life brand example</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.alaninu.com/\">Alani Nutrition</a></p> \n<p>You’ve probably never heard of Alani Nu; they’re a nutrition company based in my hometown of Louisville, Kentucky. I order their vitamins because 1) <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alaninutrition/\">they’re proven to work</a>, and 2) I trust and respect the brand (and it’s gorgeous!). On their website, they’ve <a href=\"https://www.alaninu.com/pages/our-difference\">clearly and simply outlined their unique values and benefits</a> as part of their overall brand. Highlighting these makes it easy for customers like me to trust their products and choose them over competitors.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/branding-3.png?width=600&amp;name=branding-3.png\" alt=\"branding-3\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\"></span></img></p> \n<h3>4. Create your visual assets</h3> \n<p>At this point, you should understand your target audience, your mission statement, and the unique qualities that make up your business.</p> \n<p>If you can say with confidence that you’ve mastered these steps, it’s time to move onto one of the more exciting parts of branding — the visual design. We’re talking about your logo, color palette, typography (fonts), iconography, and other visual components.</p> \n<p>As you create these elements, build a set of brand guidelines (or a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/examples-brand-style-guides\">brand style guide</a>) to govern the composition and use of your visual assets. This will ensure that whoever uses your new branding does so accurately and consistently. <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/style-guide\">Check out HubSpot’s brand guidelines for reference.</a></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/branding-1-1.png?width=600&amp;name=branding-1-1.png\" alt=\"branding-1-1\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<p><em>Note</em>: Design can be just as intimidating as it is exciting. Consider hiring a professional with <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/design\">logo and identity design experience</a>&nbsp;or starting with a few <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/design-templates\">helpful design templates</a>.</p> \n<p><em><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/create-brand-style-guide?hubs_post-cta=pillar_allphrase\">Take your brand to the next level with this free e-book on creating a brand style guide. Download templates, too!</a></em></p> \n<h3>5. Find your brand voice</h3> \n<p>Next, consider the auditory component of your brand. What would your brand sound like if you had a conversation with it, or if it texted you?</p> \n<p>How you communicate with your target market is also considered part of your branding. You want to define a brand voice that connects and resonates with your audience — otherwise, they probably won’t pay attention. Because of that, don’t hesitate to return to step one to get familiar with to whom you’re speaking.</p> \n<p>From your advertising campaigns and social media captions to your blog posts and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/brand-story\">brand story</a>, ensure your tone is consistent throughout all of your written content. Give your audience a chance to get familiar with your brand and learn to recognize the sound of your voice. Better yet, master a fun, entertaining voice, and your customers will <em>look forward</em> to your social media and email updates.</p> \n<p><strong>Real-life brand example</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/integrations/mailchimp\">MailChimp</a></p> \n<p>MailChimp is a great example of a brand that speaks with a clear, consistent tone. When I used their free plan for my small business, I always chuckled when receiving their emails and working in their interface. From its web copy to its email blasts and social media captions, MailChimp has established a brand voice and personality that is personable, fun, and accessible — it can be hard to explain the technical parts of a software product <a href=\"https://mailchimp.com/features/ab-testing/\">(like A/B testing), but MailChimp has mastered that, too</a>.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/branding-4.png?width=600&amp;name=branding-4.png\" alt=\"branding-4\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\"><em><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BnJjDMJFMXT/\">Source</a></em></span></img></p> \n<h3><a></a>6. Put your branding to work</h3> \n<p>Your brand only works if you do. Once you finish designing and creating your new brand (or rebrand) integrate it throughout every inch of your business. Pay extra attention to ensure it’s displayed anywhere your business touches customers. Here are a handful of tips for applying your brand across your organization.</p> \n<h4>Website</h4> \n<p>Splash your logo, color palette, and typography across your website. Don’t use anything but your predefined assets in your brand guidelines. Your website is a major part of your company identity — if it doesn’t reflect your brand, it will only provide a jarring customer experience. Also, be sure that all web copy, calls-to-action, and product descriptions reflect your brand voice.</p> \n<h4>Social media</h4> \n<p>All profile photos, cover art, and branded imagery should reflect your brand. Consider putting your logo as your profile photo — this will make it easier for customers to recognize your business. As with your website, be sure all profile information, posts, and captions reflect your brand voice.</p> \n<h4>Packaging</h4> \n<p>If you have a physical products business, your product is probably the most tangible way that customers interact with your brand. For that reason, your packaging should reflect your new branding — in its design, colors, size, and feel.</p> \n<p><strong>Real-life brand example</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.chobani.com/\">Chobani</a></p> \n<p>I love Chobani yogurt (confession: I’m eating it right now). <a href=\"https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logo_identity_and_packaging_for_chobani_done_in_house.php\">Their new branding</a> immediately tells me that they produce <a href=\"https://www.chobani.com/about/\">authentic, healthy</a> Greek yogurt. That’s one of the main reasons I buy Chobani. Recently, I realized that their yogurt packages are made with a very earthy, textured material — an <a href=\"https://www.packworld.com/article/package-design/redesign/chobani-stays-top-staying-front\">intentional decision</a> that supports the overall <em>experience</em> they’ve paired with purchasing and eating the Chobani brand.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/branding-2-1.jpg?width=600&amp;name=branding-2-1.jpg\" alt=\"branding-2-1\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<h4>Advertising</h4> \n<p>Because advertisements (digital and print) are often used to establish brand awareness and introduce consumers to your brand, it’s critical that they reflect your branding. In fact, your branding should make the ad creation process easier — with your brand style guide, you already know how your ads should appear and what type of copy to write.</p> \n<h4>Sales and customer service</h4> \n<p>A brand is only as powerful as the people behind it, and if your people aren’t putting your brand to work, it won’t work for you. Moreover, your brand applies to more than your marketing. Inform your sales and customer service folks of your brand guidelines and tell them to use it, especially when they engage directly with customers. Whether they are sharing a branded product demo or answering customer support inquiries, encourage them to use your logo, tagline, imagery, and brand voice.</p> \n<p><em><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/essential-guide-to-branding-your-company?hubs_post-cta=pillar_allphrase\">Download our Essential Guide to Branding Your Company to learn everything you need to go from same-old business to must-have brand.</a></em></p> \n<div class=\"hsg-featured-snippet\"> \n <div class=\"hsg-featured-snippet__wrapper\"> \n  <h2><a></a>Branding Tips for Small Business</h2> \n  <ul> \n   <li class=\"hsg-featured-snippet__wrapper--content\">Treat your brand as a person</li> \n   <li class=\"hsg-featured-snippet__wrapper--content\">Prioritize consistency</li> \n   <li class=\"hsg-featured-snippet__wrapper--content\">Follow a brand strategy</li> \n   <li class=\"hsg-featured-snippet__wrapper--content\">Don’t let inspiration turn into imitation</li> \n   <li class=\"hsg-featured-snippet__wrapper--content\">Use branding to hire</li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n</div> \n<h3>Treat your brand as a person</h3> \n<p>To best wrap your head around the branding process, think of your brand as a person. Your brand should have an identity (who it is), personality (how it behaves), and experience (how it’s remembered).</p> \n<p>Ask yourself these questions about your brand:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>How would your brand introduce itself? If it had to describe its appearance, how would it do so?</li> \n <li>How would your brand talk about your products or services? Would it be serious and professional, or would it be humorous and edgy?</li> \n <li>What would someone say about your brand after “meeting” it for the first time? What are a few sentences they’d use to describe it?</li> \n</ul> \n<p>The purpose of branding is to create relationships with your customers. The easiest way to do this is to treat your brand as a person and understand that you want your customers to do the same.</p> \n<p><strong>Real-life brand example</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.whiskeyriff.com/\">Whiskey Riff</a></p> \n<p>Whiskey Riff is another brand you’re probably not familiar with. It’s a two-man media company based here in Chicago that’s dubbed themselves “the most entertaining country music site ever”. I’m a fan because I love country music, enjoy their written and podcast content, and proudly wear some of <a href=\"https://shop.whiskeyriff.com/\">their awesome apparel</a>.</p> \n<p>If Whiskey Riff was a person, here’s how I’d think it would answer the questions above:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>“Hey, I’m Whiskey Riff. I love country music and, you guessed it, Whiskey. My logo was inspired by the<span><span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"http://www.publicartinchicago.com/chicago-the-y-symbol-municipal-device/\">Y in the circle on the Chicago Theater marquee</a>, and I'm&nbsp;</span>adorned with horizontal red stripes and stars —&nbsp;which&nbsp;represent&nbsp;the American and Chicago flags.”</li> \n <li>“I publish in-your-face content about what’s going on in country music today. If you don’t like it, don’t read it. My podcast featured my founders interviewing country music artists and telling hilarious stories. Check out my apparel line; my t-shirts, tanks, hats, and accessories can be seen at country music festivals (and on stages) nationwide.”</li> \n <li>“Whiskey Riff is like that first shot of Jack Daniels — that much-needed, refreshing drink after a long day. Its a break from that cookie-cutter way of life, and you immediately appreciate — and trust — its candidness. There’s absolutely nothing like it in the industry.”</li> \n</ul> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/branding-5.png?width=600&amp;name=branding-5.png\" alt=\"branding-5\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<h3>Prioritize consistency</h3> \n<p>Inconsistency is <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/branding-mistakes\">the number one branding mistake</a> that companies make. Inconsistency undermines your brand and confuses your customers. Recognizable, valuable brands prioritize consistency — and they reap the benefits. When your brand is a unified presence across mediums and platforms, customers can easily get familiar with, recognize, and come to prefer your brand over time. Brand guidelines can help with this initiative.</p> \n<h3>Build and follow a brand strategy</h3> \n<p>A <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/31739/7-components-that-comprise-a-comprehensive-brand-strategy.aspx\">brand strategy</a> is more than your brand guidelines; it’s a plan with specific, long-term goals that can be achieved as your brand evolves. These goals typically revolve around your brand’s purpose, emotion, flexibility, competitive awareness, and employee involvement.</p> \n<p>Remember how I said that branding is a continuous process? There’s a lot that goes into it. A brand strategy can help you turn that process into a well-oiled practice that keeps your brand moving toward success and recognition.</p> \n<h3>Don’t let inspiration turn into imitation</h3> \n<p>Competitive analysis is important. Not only does it educate you on where your competition stands and how they are excelling, but it can also give you ideas on how you can improve or further set apart your brand.</p> \n<p>However, be conscious to not fall into an imitation trap. Keep your competitive research limited and focus on what your organization brings to the table. Just because a competitor (or two) has branded their company in a certain way doesn’t mean that you have to follow suit. New, unique, provocative brands are memorable brands.</p> \n<h3>Use branding to hire</h3> \n<p>Strong branding makes your employees proud. I know I’m proud to be associated with HubSpot, much less <em>work</em> there. Leverage your branding to attract talented people. If hiring is a strong initiative for your organization, dedicate some of your resources to <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/employer-branding\">employer branding</a>. Employer branding is how you market your company to job seekers and current employees. If you’re publically proud of your organization, others will be, too.</p> \n<h2>Ready, Set, Brand</h2> \n<p>Branding is your organization’s name, logo, color palette, voice, and imagery. It’s also more. It’s that <em>intangible</em> feeling your customers have when they interact with your brand. You know … that <em>experience</em> we talked about in the beginning.</p> \n<p>That’s how powerhouse brands deviate from all the others. The tangible components contribute to this — a gorgeous logo, a clever tagline, an authentic manifesto, and a clear brand voice — but truly strong brands thrive when they focus on the big picture of their brand. Get to the heart and soul of your target audience <em>and</em> your organization, and a successful brand will follow.&nbsp;</p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p> \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fbranding&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \" />","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 11 Nov 2020 20:35:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"20a44f6d45d52722906e29925395a01b","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"adecker@hubspot.com (Allie Decker)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/branding-6.png?width=600&name=branding-6.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn62@2020_2/2020/11/14/17-30-21-922_b1b8185b2ebfc704.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/branding-3.png?width=600&name=branding-3.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn40@2020_5/2020/11/14/17-30-22-539_15b3e4a2506a7b14.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/branding-1-1.png?width=600&name=branding-1-1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn94@2020_4/2020/11/14/17-30-24-035_24561727d79ae986.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/branding-4.png?width=600&name=branding-4.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn53@2020_5/2020/11/14/17-30-20-493_7683c76e38730255.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/branding-2-1.jpg?width=600&name=branding-2-1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn90@2020_1/2020/11/14/17-30-21-490_aff8d2cf5c619a1d.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/branding-5.png?width=600&name=branding-5.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn73@2020_1/2020/11/14/17-30-20-594_c1955359ef0d9a59.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fbranding&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn1@2020_1/2020/11/14/17-30-20-581_09cb2800cc9fcd61.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605375018186},{"createdTime":"2020-11-15 01:30:18","updatedTime":"2020-11-15 01:30:18","title":"Brand Strategy 101: 7 Essentials for Strong Company Branding","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/31739/7-components-that-comprise-a-comprehensive-brand-strategy.aspx","description":"<p>Let's say you've come to the difficult realization that quite frankly your brand -- if you can even call it that -- is <strong style=\"letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: transparent;\"><em>all over</em></strong> the place. Or perhaps worse, you have a defined brand, but you're noticing that it just doesn't seem to mesh with who you <em style=\"letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: transparent;\">really</em> are and what you <em style=\"letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: transparent;\">really</em> do.</p> \n<p>Don't panic.</p> \n<p>Before you get all hung up on what shade of green to use for your logo or what tone you're going to use when engaging with people on Twitter, you need to step back and take a look at the big picture.</p> \n<h3>What is Brand Strategy?</h3> \n<p>Brand strategy is a plan that encompasses specific, long-term goals that can be achieved with the evolution of a successful brand -- the combined components of your company's character that make it identifiable.</p> \n<p>(We'll get into that more in a bit.)</p> \n<p>A well-defined and executed brand strategy affects all aspects of a business and is directly connected to consumer needs, emotions, and competitive environments.</p> \n<p>First, let's clear up the biggest misconception about brand strategy: Your brand is not your product, your logo, your website, or your name.</p> \n<p>In fact, your brand is much more than that -- it's the stuff that feels intangible. But it's that hard-to-pin-down feeling that separates powerhouse and mediocre brands from each other.</p> \n<p>So to help you rein in what many marketers consider more of an art and less of a science, we've broken down seven essential components of a comprehensive brand strategy that will help keep your company around for ages.</p> \n<div class=\"video-container-responsive\">\n <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/z25lC85v9Zw\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div> \n<h2>7 Components for a Comprehensive Branding Strategy</h2> \n<h3>1) Purpose</h3> \n<p>\"Every brand makes a promise. But in a marketplace in which consumer confidence is low and budgetary vigilance is high, it’s not just making a promise that separates one brand from another, but having a defining purpose,\" <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/2009/11/11/brand-defining-marketing-cmo-network-allen-adamson.html\">explains Allen Adamson</a>, chairman of the North America region of brand consulting and design firm Landor Associates.</p> \n<p>While understanding what your business promises is necessary when defining your brand positioning, knowing <em>why</em> you wake up every day and go to work carries more weight. In other words, your purpose is more specific, in that it serves as a differentiator between you and your competitors.</p> \n<p>How can you define your business' purpose? According to <a href=\"http://www.brandingstrategyinsider.com/2014/08/defining-your-brand-purpose.html#.VcTD11PF-vo\">Business Strategy Insider</a>, purpose can be viewed in two ways:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Functional: </strong>This concept focuses on the evaluations of success in terms of immediate and commercial reasons -- i.e. the purpose of the business is to make money.</li> \n <li><strong>Intentional: </strong>This concept focuses on success as it relates to the ability to make money and do good in the world.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>While making money is important to almost every business, we admire brands that emphasize their willingness to achieve more than just profitability, like IKEA:</p> \n<p><img class=\"wt-blog__normal-image\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/00-Blog-Related_Images/IKEA_Vision.png?width=508&amp;height=322&amp;name=IKEA_Vision.png\" width=\"508\" height=\"322\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Source:<em> <a href=\"http://www.ikea.com/ms/en_SG/about_ikea/our_business_idea/index.html\">IKEA</a></em></span></p> \n<p>IKEA's vision isn't just to sell furniture, but rather, to \"create a better everyday life.\" This approach is appealing to potential customers, as it demonstrates their commitment to providing value beyond the point of sale.</p> \n<p>When defining your business' purpose, keep this example in mind. While making money is a priority, operating under that notion alone does little to set your brand apart from others in your industry.</p> \n<p>Our advice? Dig a little deeper. If you need inspiration, check out the brands you admire, and see how they frame their mission and vision statements.</p> \n<h3>2) Consistency</h3> \n<p>The key to consistency is to avoid talking about things that don’t relate to or enhance your brand. Added a new photo to your business' <a title=\"Facebook\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/Beyond-the-Facebook-Business-Page/\">Facebook Page</a>? What does it mean for your company? Does it align with your message, or was it just something funny that would, quite frankly, confuse your audience?</p> \n<p>In an effort to give your brand a platform to stand on, you need to be sure that all of your messaging is cohesive. Ultimately, consistency contributes to brand recognition, which fuels customer loyalty. (No pressure, right?)</p> \n<p>To see a great example of consistency, let's look at <a href=\"http://us.coca-cola.com/home/\">Coca-Cola</a>. As a result of its commitment to consistency, every element of the brand's marketing works harmoniously together. This has helped it become one of the most <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/powerful-brands/\">recognizable brands in the world</a>.</p> \n<p>Even on the surface of its social media accounts, for example, the seamlessness of its brand is very apparent:</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202017-10-05%20at%203.52.07%20PM.png?width=600&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202017-10-05%20at%203.52.07%20PM.png\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202017-10-05%20at%203.54.07%20PM.png?width=600&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202017-10-05%20at%203.54.07%20PM.png\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202017-10-05%20at%203.55.35%20PM.png?width=600&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202017-10-05%20at%203.55.35%20PM.png\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202017-10-05%20at%203.57.02%20PM.png?width=600&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202017-10-05%20at%203.57.02%20PM.png\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px;\"></p> \n<p>To avoid leaving potential customers struggling to put the disconnected pieces of your business together, consider the benefits of creating a style guide. A style guide can encompass everything from the tone of voice you'll use to the color scheme you'll employ to the way you'll position certain products or services.</p> \n<p>By taking the time to define and agree upon these considerations, your brand will benefit as a whole.</p> \n<h3>3) Emotion</h3> \n<p>Customers aren't always rational.</p> \n<p>How else do you explain the person who paid thousands of dollars more for a Harley rather than buying another cheaper, equally well-made bike? There was an emotional voice in there somewhere, whispering: <em>“Buy a Harley.” </em></p> \n<p>But why?</p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.harley-davidson.com/content/h-d/en_US/home.html\">Harley Davidson</a> uses emotional branding by creating a community around its brand. It began <a href=\"https://members.hog.com/website/index.jsp?redirectUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fmembers.hog.com%2Fwebsite%2Fmain.jsp%3Fhbx_camp_id%3Dhdredirect%26amp%3Burlvar%3Dhogcom%26amp%3Bcamp_id%3D16%26amp%3Bsource_cd%3DVanity_hogcom\">HOG</a> -- Harley Owners Group -- to connect their customers with their brand (and each other).</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202017-10-05%20at%203.59.16%20PM.png?width=600&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202017-10-05%20at%203.59.16%20PM.png\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Source:<em> <a href=\"https://members.hog.com/website/index.jsp?redirectUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fmembers.hog.com%2Fwebsite%2Fmain.jsp%3Fhbx_camp_id%3Dhdredirect%26amp%3Burlvar%3Dhogcom%26amp%3Bcamp_id%3D16%26amp%3Bsource_cd%3DVanity_hogcom\">HOG</a></em></span></p> \n<p>By providing customers with an opportunity to feel like they're part of a larger group that's more tight-knit than just a bunch of motorcycle riders, Harley Davidson is able to position themselves as an obvious choice for someone looking to purchase a bike.</p> \n<p>Why? People have an innate desire to build relationships. Research from psychologists Roy Baumeister and Mark Leary best describes this need in their \"<a href=\"http://www.scienceofrelationships.com/home/2012/4/16/the-need-to-belong-part-of-what-makes-us-human.html\">belongingness hypothesis</a>,\" which states: \"People have a basic psychological need to feel closely connected to others, and that caring, affectionate bonds from close relationships are a major part of human behavior.\"</p> \n<p>Not to mention, belongingness -- the need for love, affection, and being part of groups -- falls directly in the middle of Maslow's hierarchy of needs, which aims to categorize different human needs.</p> \n<p>The lesson to be learned? Find a way to connect with your customers on a deeper, more emotional level. Do you give them peace of mind? Make them feel like part of the family? Do you make life easier? Use emotional triggers like these to strengthen your relationship and foster loyalty.</p> \n<h3>4) Flexibility</h3> \n<p>In this fast-changing world, marketers must remain flexible to stay relevant. On the plus side, this frees you to be creative with your campaigns.</p> \n<p>You may be thinking, <em>\"Wait a minute, how am I supposed to remain consistent while also being flexible?\"</em></p> \n<p>Good question. While consistency aims to set the standard for your brand, flexibility enables you to make adjustments that build interest and distinguish your approach from that of your competition.</p> \n<p>In other words, \"effective identity programs require enough consistency to be identifiable, but enough variation to keep things fresh and human,\" <a href=\"http://www.peopledesign.com/brand-variation\">explains </a><a href=\"http://www.peopledesign.com/brand-variation\">president of Peopledesign</a>, Kevin Budelmann.</p> \n<p>A great example of this type of strategic balance comes from <a href=\"http://oldspice.com/en\">Old Spice</a>. These days, Old Spice is one of the best examples of successful marketing across the board. However, up until recently, wearing Old Spice was pretty much an unspoken requirement for dads everywhere. Today, it's one of the most popular brands for men of all ages.</p> \n<p>The secret? Flexibility.</p> \n<p>Aware that it needed to do something to secure its place in the market, <a href=\"https://www.wk.com/office/portland/client/old_spice\">Old Spice teamed up with Wieden+Kennedy</a> to position their brand for a new customer base.</p> \n<p><img class=\"wt-blog__normal-image\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Old_Spice_Before_and_After.png?width=560&amp;height=328&amp;name=Old_Spice_Before_and_After.png\" width=\"560\" height=\"328\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Source:<em> <a href=\"http://worksdesigngroup.com/brand-stories-old-spice-rebrand/\">Works Design Group</a></em></span> \n<p>Between new commercials, a new website, new packaging, and new product names, Old Spice managed to attract the attention of a new, younger generation by making strategic enhancements to its already strong brand.</p> \n<p>So if your old tactics aren’t working anymore, don’t be afraid to change. Just because it worked in the past doesn't mean it's working now.</p> \n<p>Take the opportunity to engage your followers in fresh, new ways. Are there some out-of-the-box partnerships your brand can make? Are there attributes about your product you never highlighted? Use those to connect with new customers and remind your old ones why they love you.</p> \n<h3>5) Employee Involvement</h3> As we mentioned before, achieving a sense of consistency is important if you wish to build brand recognition. And while a style guide can help you achieve a cohesive digital experience, it's equally important for your employees to be well versed in the how they should be communicating with customers and representing the brand. \n<p>If your brand is playful and bubbly through Twitter engagements, then it wouldn't make sense if a customer called in and was connected with a grumpy, monotone representative, right?</p> \n<p>To avoid this type of mismatched experience, take note of Zappos' approach.</p> \n<p>If you've ever been on the line with a customer service representative from Zappos, you know what I'm talking about. If you haven't, <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/InfinitOInc/10-inspiring-zappos-customer-support-stories\">check out this SlideShare</a> which details some of its most inspiring customer support stories.</p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.zappos.com/\">Zappos</a> is so committed to ensuring that not only its&nbsp;brand, <em>but all brands,</em> remain consistent across digital and human interactions that they've dedicated an entire department to the cause called <a href=\"http://www.zapposinsights.com/\">Zappos Insights.</a></p>  \n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"> \n <p>Come join us and learn the Zappos WOW approach to customer service!

Reward them for that love.</p> \n<p>These customers have gone out their way to write about you, to tell their friends about you, and to act as your brand ambassadors. Cultivating loyalty from these people early on will yield more returning customers -- and more profit for your business.</p> \n<p>Sometimes, just a thank you is all that's needed. Other times, it's better to go above and beyond. Write them a personalized letter. Sent them some special swag. Ask them to write a review, and feature them prominently on your website. (Or all of the above!)</p> \n<p>When we reached <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/15k\">15,000 customers here at HubSpot</a>, we wanted to say thank you in a big way, while remaining true to our brand ... so we dropped 15,000 orange ping pong balls from our fourth-floor balcony and spelled out thank you in big metallic balloons:</p> \n<div class=\"video-container-responsive\">\n <iframe style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_Nints9uh4o\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div> \n<p>And while it may have seemed a little out of the ordinary to some folks, for those who know our brand, the gesture made perfect sense.</p> \n<p>Loyalty is a critical part of every brand strategy, especially if you're looking to support your sales organization. At the end of the day, highlighting a positive relationship between you and your existing customers sets the tone for what potential customers can expect if they choose to do business with you.</p> \n<h3>7) Competitive Awareness</h3> \n<p>Take the competition as a challenge to improve your own strategy and create greater value in your overall brand. You are in the same business and going after the same customers, right? So watch what they do.</p> \n<p>Do some of their tactics succeed? Do some fail? Tailor your brand positioning based on their experience to better your company.</p> \n<p>A great example of how to improve your brand by learning from your competitors comes from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pizzahut\">Pizza Hut</a>:</p> \n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"> \n <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/TherealElysium?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@TheRealElysium</a> You know our vote. ^AB</p> — Pizza Hut (@pizzahut) \n <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pizzahut/status/711617215649349632?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 20, 2016</a>\n</blockquote> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">  </p> \n<p>When a pizza lover posed this question to his Twitter following, Pizza Hut didn't miss a beat, and playfully responded in minutes, before <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dominos\">Domino's</a> had a chance to speak up.</p> \n<p>If Domino's is keeping an eye on the competitors, they'll know to act fast the next time a situation like this arises.</p> \n<p>For HubSpot customers, keeping tabs on your competitor's social mentions is easy using the <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/social-inbox\">Social Monitoring App</a>. <a href=\"https://knowledge.hubspot.com/social-media-user-guide/how-to-create-streams-in-the-social-monitoring-tool\">Check out this article</a> to learn more about how to set up custom social streams.</p> \n<p>And while staying in tune with your competitor's strategies is important if you want to enhance your brand, don't let them dictate each and every move you make.</p> \n<p>Sure, you probably sell a similar product or service as many other companies, but you're in business because your brand is unique.

Ideally, if you've had a positive experience with one of American Express's customer service reps, you've seen this value displayed first-hand.</p>  \n<p>Alternatively, take a look at one of Google's values -- \"Focus on the user and all else will follow.\"</p> \n<p>Any Google search will show you they stand by their purpose to serve the user. Undoubtedly, you find most answers to your common questions on page one of Google, and more recently, it's likely separated in its own featured snippet, as well.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Having core company values can help you ensure each of your employees, from top leadership to entry-level, are working towards the same common goal, and share a bigger purpose.</p> \n<p>Purpose is undeniably critical for employee satisfaction. In fact, an Imperative survey of LinkedIn members found <a href=\"https://cdn.imperative.com/media/public/Global_Purpose_Index_2016.pdf\">73% of purpose-oriented members are satisfied</a> in their jobs, compared to 64% who are not purpose-oriented.</p> \n<p>Plus, purpose doesn't just improve employee satisfaction -- it also increases your bottom line. The same Imperative survey found <a href=\"https://cdn.imperative.com/media/public/Global_Purpose_Index_2016.pdf\">58% of companies with a clearly articulated and understood purpose</a> experienced growth of +10%, compared to just 42% of companies that don't prioritize purpose.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, core values are critical if you want to create a long-lasting, successful, and motivating place to work.</p> \n<p>Whether you work for a new company in need of core-value inspiration, or an older company in need of a value revamp, you're in luck -- here, we've cultivated a list of some of the best company values. Additionally, we'll examine how some companies truly honor their values.</p> \n<div class=\"hsg-featured-snippet\"> \n <h2>Company Values</h2> \n <ol> \n  <li>Integrity</li> \n  <li>Boldness</li> \n  <li>Honesty</li> \n  <li>Trust</li> \n  <li>Accountability</li> \n  <li>Commitment to Customers</li> \n  <li>Passion</li> \n  <li>Fun</li> \n  <li>Humility</li> \n  <li>Continuous Learning</li> \n  <li>Ownership</li> \n  <li>Constant Improvement</li> \n  <li>Leadership</li> \n  <li>Diversity</li> \n  <li>Innovation</li> \n  <li>Quality</li> \n  <li>Teamwork</li> \n  <li>Simplicity</li> \n </ol> \n</div> \n<h2><strong>Examples of Companies with Inspiring Core Values</strong></h2> \n<h3>1. <a href=\"https://www.americanexpress.com/us/supplier-management/supplier-standards/our-blue-box-shared-values.html\">American Express </a></h3> \n<ul> \n <li><em>Customer Commitment: We develop relationships that make a positive difference in our customers' lives. </em></li> \n <li><em>Quality: We provide outstanding products and unsurpassed service that, together, deliver premium value to our customers. </em></li> \n <li><em>Integrity: We uphold the highest standards of integrity in all of our actions. </em></li> \n <li><em>Teamwork: We work together, across boundaries, to meet the needs of our customers and to help our Company win. </em></li> \n <li><em>Respect for People: We value our people, encourage their development and reward their performance. </em></li> \n <li><em>Good Citizenship: We are good citizens in the communities in which we live and work. </em></li> \n <li><em>A Will to Win: We exhibit a strong will to win in the marketplace and in every aspect of our business. </em></li> \n <li><em>Personal Accountability: We are personally accountable for delivering on our commitments. </em></li> \n</ul> \n<p>American Express doesn't just hit the bare minimum when it comes to polite, helpful customer service -- they go above-and-beyond to solve for their customers, even when there's no protocol in place.</p> \n<p>For instance, Raymond Joabar, the Executive Vice President at American Express, recently told this story in a <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/micahsolomon/2017/12/15/american-expresss-customer-service-secrets-consulting-with-amex-on-what-makes-a-difference/#2f4b98b840ff\">Forbes interview</a>: \"One time, a hotel café manager [an Amex merchant] alerted my team that he had accidentally sold a display cake with harmful chemicals and needed to find the customers before they ate it. Obviously, there’s no procedure for that, but our team took ownership of the problem. They gathered all the information they could from the record of charge, identified 21 Card Members who used their cards at the café during that time frame, reviewed the accounts to find the right match, and then called the Card Member in time before they served the cake at an anniversary party.\"</p> \n<p>\"The important point here,\" Joabar noted, \"other than that everybody ended up safe and sound -- is that there isn’t a script for every situation, so we empower our care professionals to do what’s right for the customer. And we recognize what they do with this empowerment as well. We give awards to employees who go above and beyond to help customers and we share their stories across the company.\"</p> \n<p>This anecdote exemplifies American Express employees' commitment to their customers even when it's not easy, and demonstrates the company's dedication to living by its values.</p> \n<h3>2. <a href=\"https://www.google.com/intl/en/about/philosophy.html\">Google</a></h3> \n<ul> \n <li><em>Focus on the user and all else will follow.</em></li> \n <li><em>It’s best to do one thing really, really well.</em></li> \n <li><em>Fast is better than slow.</em></li> \n <li><em>Democracy on the web works.</em></li> \n <li><em>You don’t need to be at your desk to need an answer.</em></li> \n <li><em>You can make money without doing evil.</em></li> \n <li><em>There’s always more information out there.</em></li> \n <li><em>The need for information crosses all borders.</em></li> \n <li><em>You can be serious without a suit.</em></li> \n <li><em>Great just isn’t good enough.</em></li> \n</ul> \n<p>On Google's <a href=\"https://www.google.com/intl/en/about/philosophy.html\">philosophy page</a>, they don't just list their core values -- they also provide examples.</p> \n<p>For instance, consider their value, \"You can make money without doing evil.\" While many companies likely tout the benefits of integrity, Google references strategic efforts its made to avoid \"evil\" business, including -- \"We don’t allow ads to be displayed on our results pages unless they are relevant where they are shown … We don’t accept pop–up advertising, which interferes with your ability to see the content you’ve requested ... [and] Advertising on Google is always clearly identified as a 'Sponsored Link,' so it does not compromise the integrity of our search results.\"</p> \n<p>Ultimately, a core value doesn't have much power if your company can't list intentional, calculated decisions it's made to put values ahead of profit.</p> \n<h3>3. <a href=\"https://www.coca-cola.co.uk/about-us/mission-vision-and-values\">Coca Cola</a></h3> \n<ul> \n <li><em>Leadership: The courage to shape a better future.</em></li> \n <li><em>Collaboration: Leverage collective genius.</em></li> \n <li><em>Integrity: Be real.</em></li> \n <li><em>Accountability: If it is to be, it's up to me.</em></li> \n <li><em>Passion: Committed in heart and mind.</em></li> \n <li><em>Diversity: As inclusive as our brands.</em></li> \n <li><em>Quality: What we do, we do well.</em></li> \n</ul> \n<p>Coca Cola demonstrates its diversity core value with its public <a href=\"https://www.coca-colacompany.com/our-company/diversity/global-diversity-mission\">Global Diversity Mission</a>page, which lists the company's diversity-related efforts, such as, \"[collecting employee] feedback through formal surveys and informally through their participation in our business resource groups, various diversity education programs and our Resolution Resources Program, where associates can work to resolve issues they face in our Company.\"</p> \n<p>Additionally, Coca Cola's Global Diversity Mission page exemplifies their commitment to accountability, as well -- they've publicly included pie charts with statistics regarding their global employee gender and race ratios. By acknowledging both their efforts and their shortcomings, Coca Cola is able to show their desire to live up to their values, while taking responsibility for any mis-match between their ideals and reality.</p> \n<h3>4.<a href=\"https://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/mission-values/core-values\">Whole Foods</a></h3> \n<ul> \n <li><em>We Satisfy And Delight Our Customers -- Our customers are the lifeblood of our business and our most important stakeholder. We strive to meet or exceed their expectations on every shopping experience.</em></li> \n <li><em>We Promote Team Member Growth And Happiness -- Our success is dependent upon the collective energy, intelligence, and contributions of all of our Team Members.</em></li> \n <li><em>We Care About Our Communities And The Environment -- We serve and support a local experience. The unique character of each store is a direct reflection of a community’s people, culture, and cuisine.</em></li> \n <li><em>We Practice Win-Win Partnerships With Our Suppliers -- We view our trade partners as allies in serving our stakeholders. We treat them with respect, fairness and integrity – expecting the same in return.</em></li> \n</ul> \n<p>Underneath each of its values on its core value page, Whole Foods provides a link, such as, \"Learn more about how we care about our communities and the environment.\"</p> \n<p>Ultimately, their page demonstrates their ability to walk the walk. For instance, to exemplify their commitment to local communities, Whole Foods created a <a href=\"https://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/mission-values/caring-communities/local-producer-loan-program\">Local Producer Loan Program</a>, in which they provide up to $25 million in low-interest loans to independent local farmers and food artisans.</p> \n<p>Additionally, Whole Foods <a href=\"https://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/mission-values/environmental-stewardship/green-mission\">provides a list</a> of environmentally-friendly efforts they've practiced since 1980, including \"Printing and packaging using recycled paper and water- or vegetable-based, composting to decrease landfill waste, and no single-use plastic bags at checkout since 2008\".</p> \n<p>If you've ever been to a Whole Foods, you know they're serious about their efforts to reduce waste and help the local community. In fact, its part of the reason so many customers are brand loyalists -- because they support those efforts, too.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, good core values can help an audience identify with, and stay loyal to, your brand, rather than flipping between you and competitors. To ensure long-term success <em>and</em>long-term employee retention, it's critical you create -- and live by -- certain non-negotiable company values.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fcompany-values&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 12 Nov 2020 15:19:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"93e687f4eb626709e683d63da5b3f348","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Caroline Forsey","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fcompany-values&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn74@2020_1/2020/11/14/17-30-22-928_9fc3ef6f95eaf171.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605375018183},{"createdTime":"2020-11-15 01:30:18","updatedTime":"2020-11-15 01:30:18","title":"The Ultimate Guide to Storytelling","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/storytelling","description":"<p>An art.</p> \n<p>Not a process, method, or technique.

This <a href=\"https://www.referralcandy.com/blog/ultimate-storytelling-guide-infographic/\">graphic from ReferralCandy</a> helps outline what stories <i>are</i> and <i>are not</i>.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/storytelling-1.png?width=600&amp;name=storytelling-1.png\" alt=\"what-is-storytelling\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>Storytelling is an art form as old as time and has a place in every culture and society. Why? Because stories are a universal language that everyone — regardless of dialect, hometown, or heritage — can understand. Stories stimulate imagination and passion and create a sense of community among listeners and tellers alike.</p> \n<p>Telling a story is like painting a picture with words. While everyone can tell a story, certain people fine-tune their storytelling skills and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/two-simple-frameworks-thatll-make-you-a-better-storyteller-in-business-and-in-life\">become a storyteller</a> on behalf of their organization, brand, or business. You might’ve heard of these folks — we typically refer to them as <i>marketers</i>, <i>content writers</i>, or <i>PR professionals</i>.</p> \n<p>Every member of an organization can tell a story. But before we get into the how, let’s talk about why we tell stories — as a society, culture, and economy.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>Why Do We Tell Stories?</h2> \n<a></a> \n<p>There are a variety of reasons to tell stories — to sell, entertain, educate or brag. We’ll talk about that below. Right now, I want to discuss why we choose storytelling over, say, a data-driven powerpoint or bulleted list. Why are stories our go-to way of sharing, explaining, and selling information?</p> \n<p>Here’s why.</p> \n<h3>Stories solidify abstract concepts and simplify complex messages.</h3> \n<p>We’ve all experienced confusion when trying to understand a new idea. Stories provide a way around that. Think about times when stories have helped you better understand a concept … perhaps a teacher used a real-life example to explain a math problem, a preacher illustrated a situation during a sermon, or a speaker used a case study to convey complex data.</p> \n<p>Stories help solidify abstract concepts and simplify complex messages. Taking a lofty, non-tangible concept and relating it using concrete ideas is one of the biggest strengths of storytelling in business.</p> \n<a></a> \n<p>Take <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/mac/\">Apple</a>, for example. Computers and smartphones are a pretty complicated topic to describe to your typical consumer. Using real-life stories, they’ve been able to describe exactly how their products benefit users … instead of relying on technical jargon that very few customers would understand.</p> \n<h3>Stories bring people together.</h3> \n<p>Like I said above, stories are a universal language of sorts. We all understand the story of the hero, of the underdog, or of heartbreak. We all process emotions and can share feelings of elation, hope, despair, and anger. Sharing in a story gives even the most diverse people a sense of commonality and community.</p> \n<p>In a world divided by a multitude of things, stories bring people together and create a sense of community. Despite our language, religion, political preferences, or ethnicity, stories connect us through the way we feel and respond to them … Stories make us human.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.toms.com/\">TOMS</a> is a great example of this. By sharing stories of both customers and the people they serve through customer purchases, TOMS has effectively created a movement that has not only increased sales but also built a community.</p> \n<h3>Stories inspire and motivate.</h3> \n<p>Stories make us human, and the same goes for brands. When brands get transparent and authentic, it brings them down-to-earth and helps consumers connect with them and the people behind them.</p> \n<p>Tapping into people’s emotions and baring both the good and bad is how stories inspire and motivate … and eventually, drive action. Stories also foster brand loyalty. Creating a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/storytelling-diagram\">narrative around your brand</a> or product not only humanizes it but also inherently markets your business.</p> \n<p>Few brands use inspiration as a selling tactic, but ModCloth does it well. By sharing the real story of their founder, ModCloth not only makes the brand relatable and worth purchasing, but it also inspires other founders and business owners.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/storytelling-2.png?width=600&amp;name=storytelling-2.png\" alt=\"storytelling-modcloth\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Source: <a href=\"https://www.modcloth.com/about-us\">ModCloth</a></p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>What makes a good story?</h2> \n<a></a> \n<p>Words like “good” and “bad” are relative to user opinion. But there are a few non-negotiable components that make for a great storytelling experience, for both the reader and teller.</p> \n<p>Good stories are …</p> \n<ul> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Entertaining</strong><strong style=\"font-weight: 400;\">:</strong>&nbsp;Good stories keep the reader engaged and interested in what’s coming next.</li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Educational</strong><strong style=\"font-weight: 400;\">:</strong>&nbsp;Good stories spark curiosity and add to the reader’s knowledge bank.</li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Universal</strong><strong style=\"font-weight: 400;\">:</strong>&nbsp;Good stories are relatable to all readers and tap into emotions and experiences that most people undergo.</li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Organized: </strong>Good stories follow a succinct organization that helps convey the core message and helps readers absorb it.</li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Memorable</strong><strong style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: </strong>Whether through inspiration, scandal, or humor, good stories stick in the reader’s mind.</li> \n</ul> \n<a></a> \n<p>According to HubSpot Academy’s free <a href=\"https://academy.hubspot.com/lessons/the-power-of-storytelling\">Power of Storytelling course</a>, there are three components that make up a good story — regardless of the story you’re trying to tell.</p> \n<ol> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Characters</strong>. Every story features at least one character, and this character will be the key to relating your audience back to the story. This component is the bridge between you, the storyteller, and the audience. If your audience can put themselves in your character’s shoes, they’ll be more likely to follow through with your call-to-action.</li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Conflict</strong>. The conflict is the lesson of how the character overcomes a challenge. Conflict in your story elicits emotions and connects the audience through relatable experiences. When telling stories, the power lies in what you’re conveying and teaching. If there’s no conflict in your story, it’s likely not a story.</li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Resolution</strong>. Every good story has a closing, but it doesn’t always have to be a good one. Your story’s resolution should wrap up the story, provide context around the characters and conflict(s), and leave your audience with a call-to-action.</li> \n</ol> \n<p>Now that you know what your story should contain, let’s talk about how to craft your story.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>The Storytelling Process</h2> \n<a></a> \n<p>We’ve confirmed storytelling is an art. Like art, storytelling requires creativity, vision, and skill. It also requires practice. Enter: The storytelling process.</p> \n<p>Painters, sculptors, sketch artists, and potters all follow their own creative process when producing their art. It helps them know where to start, how to develop their vision, and how to perfect their practice over time. The same goes for storytelling … especially for <i>businesses</i> writing stories.</p> \n<p>Why is this process important? Because, as an organization or brand, you likely have a ton of facts, figures, and messages to get across in one succinct story. How do you know where to begin? Well, start with the first step. You’ll know where to go (and how to get there) after that.</p> \n<h3>1. Know your audience.</h3> \n<p>Who wants to hear your story? Who will benefit and respond the strongest? In order to create a compelling story, you need to understand your readers and who will respond and take action.</p> \n<a></a> \n<p>Before you put a pen to paper (or cursor to word processor), do some research on your <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/target-market\">target market</a> and define your <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/buyer-persona-research\">buyer persona(s)</a>. This process will get you acquainted with who might be reading, viewing, or listening to your story. It will also provide crucial direction for the next few steps as you build out the foundation of your story.</p> \n<h3>2. Define your core message.</h3> \n<p>Whether your story is one page or twenty, ten minutes or sixty, it should have a core message. Like the foundation of a home, it must be established before moving forward.</p> \n<p>Is your story selling a product or raising funds? Explaining a service or advocating for an issue? What is the point of your story? To help define this, try to summarize your story in six to ten words. If you can’t do that, you don’t have a core message.</p> \n<h3>3. Decide what kind of story you’re telling.</h3> \n<p>Not all stories are created equal. To determine what kind of story you’re telling, figure out how you want your audience to feel or react as they read.</p> \n<p>This will help you determine how you’re going to weave your story and what objective you’re pursuing. If your objective is to …</p> \n<ul> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">... <strong>incite action</strong>, your story should describe a how a successful action was completed in the past and explain how readers might be able to implement the same kind of change. Avoid excessive, exaggerated detail or changes in subject so your audience can focus on the action or change that your story encourages.</li> \n</ul> \n<ul> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">… <strong>tell people about yourself</strong>, tell a story that features genuine, humanizing struggles, failures, and wins. Today’s consumer appreciates and connects to brands that market with authenticity and storytelling is no exception.</li> \n</ul> \n<ul> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">… <strong>convey values</strong>, tell a story that taps into familiar emotions, characters, and situations so that readers can understand how the story applies to their own life. This is especially important when discussing values &nbsp;that some people might not agree with or understand.</li> \n</ul> \n<ul> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">… <strong>foster community or collaboration</strong>, tell a story that moves readers to discuss and share your story with others. Use a situation or experience that others can relate to and say, “Me, too!” Keep situations and characters neutral to attract the widest variety of readers.</li> \n</ul> \n<ul> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">… <strong>impart knowledge or educate</strong>, tell a story that features a trial-and-error experience, so that readers can learn about a problem and how a solution was discovered and applied. Discuss other alternative solutions, too.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>4. Establish your call-to-action.</h3> \n<p>Your objective and call-to-action (CTA) are similar, but your CTA will establish the action you’d like your audience to take after reading.</p> \n<p>What <i>exactly</i> do you want your readers to do after reading? Do you want them to donate money, subscribe to a newsletter, take a course, or buy a product? Outline this alongside your objective to make sure they line up.</p> \n<p>For example, if your objective is to foster community or collaboration, your CTA might be to “Tap the share button below.”</p> \n<h3>5. Choose your story medium.</h3> \n<p>Stories can take many shapes and forms. Some stories are read, some are watched, and others are listened to. Your chosen story medium depends on your type of story as well as resources, like time and money.</p> \n<p>Here are the different ways you can tell your story.</p> \n<ul> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>A written story</strong> is told through articles, blog posts, or books. These are mostly text and may include some images. Written stories are by far the most affordable, attainable method of storytelling as it just requires a free word processor like <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/google-docs\">Google Docs</a> … or a pen and paper.</li> \n</ul> \n<ul> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>A spoken story</strong> is told in person, like &nbsp;a presentation, pitch, or panel. TED talks are considered spoken stories. Because of their “live”, unedited nature, spoken stories typically require more practice and skill to convey messages and elicit emotions in others.</li> \n</ul> \n<ul> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>An audio story</strong> is spoken aloud but recorded — that’s what sets it apart from the spoken story. Audio stories are usually in podcast form, and with today’s technology, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/everything-you-need-to-know-before-starting-a-podcast\">creating an audio story</a> is more affordable than ever. (For a great story-driven podcast, check out <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/the-growth-show\">The Growth Show</a>!)</li> \n</ul> \n<ul> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>A digital story</strong> is told through a variety of media, such as video, animation, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/interactive-content-examples\">interactive stories</a>, and even games. This option is by far the most effective for emotionally resonant stories as well as active, visual stories … which is why it’s also the most expensive. But don’t fret: video quality doesn’t matter as much as conveying a strong message.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>6. Write!</h3> \n<p><i>Now</i> it’s time to put pen to paper and start crafting your story.</p> \n<p>With your core message, audience objective, and call-to-action already established, this step is simply about adding detail and creative flair to your story. Read more about <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/psychology-of-stories-storytelling-formula\">our storytelling formula</a> to help you with this step.</p> \n<h3>7. Share your story.</h3> \n<p>Don’t forget to share and promote your story! Like with any piece of content, creating it is only half the battle — sharing it is the other.</p> \n<p>Depending on your chosen medium, you should definitely share your story on social media and email. In addition, written stories can be promoted on your blog, <a href=\"https://medium.com/\">Medium</a>, or through guest posting on other publications. Digital stories can be shared on YouTube and Vimeo. While spoken stories are best conveyed in person, consider recording a live performance to share later.</p> \n<p>The more places you share your story, the more engagement you can expect from your audience.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>Storytelling Resources</h2> \n<a></a> \n<p>Storytelling is a trial-and-error process, and no one tells a story perfectly on the first try. That’s why we’ve collected these resources to help you fine-tune your storytelling skills and learn more about the different ways a story can be told.</p> \n<h3>For a Written Story</h3> \n<a></a> \n<a></a> \n<ul> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://oedb.org/ilibrarian/150-writing-resources/\">OEDb’s writing resources</a></li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/improving-writing-skills-tools\">HubSpot’s list of writing tools</a></li> \n</ul> \n<h3>For a Spoken Story</h3> \n<ul> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"http://storage.ted.com/tedx/manuals/tedx_speaker_guide.pdf\">The TEDx Speaker Guide</a></li> \n</ul> \n<h3>For an Audio Story</h3> \n<ul> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/how-to-start-a-podcast?hubs_post-cta=anchor&amp;hsCtaTracking=e84f333b-91fb-4c8e-bacd-5c4cd1ebaf9b%7Cc7d2eb5e-8212-471b-8aea-12752a82ae26\">HubSpot’s guide on How to Start a Podcast</a></li> \n</ul> \n<h3>For the Digital Story</h3> \n<ul> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"http://vimeo.com/videoschool/lessons\">Vimeo’s Video School</a></li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"http://animoto.com/\">Animoto</a></li> \n</ul> \n<h2>Over To You</h2> \n<p>Storytelling is an art. It’s also a process worth mastering for both your business and your customers. Stories bring people together and inspire action and response. Also, today’s consumer doesn’t decide to buy based on what you’re selling, but rather why you’re selling it.</p> \n<p>Storytelling helps you communicate that “why” in a creative, engaging way. Plus, isn’t storytelling more fun?</p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fstorytelling&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 11 Nov 2020 13:45:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"9c1effd6aa7de13bbf6d6fce8c4c0885","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"adecker@hubspot.com (Allie Decker)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/storytelling-1.png?width=600&name=storytelling-1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn98@2020_5/2020/11/14/17-30-23-180_85c921821ecd1762.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/storytelling-2.png?width=600&name=storytelling-2.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn46@2020_5/2020/11/14/17-30-20-603_e5f87d90006c87d1.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fstorytelling&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn89@2020_6/2020/11/14/17-30-23-012_2138754c998fb085.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605375018185},{"createdTime":"2020-11-15 01:30:18","updatedTime":"2020-11-15 01:30:18","title":"9 Types of Organizational Structure Every Company Should Consider","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/team-structure-diagrams","description":"<p>Choosing the best organizational structure for your company, division, or team is a lot like picking out a new car.</p> \n<p>At the most basic level, you're always looking for something road-worthy -- something that can take you (and your passengers) from point A to point B without a hitch.But beyond that, there are a lot of options to consider. Automatic or manual? Four-wheel drive or two? Built-in GPS? Leather interior? Flux capacitor? (Only if you're going <a href=\"http://backtothefuture.wikia.com/wiki/Flux_capacitor\">back in time</a>, of course.)</p> \n<p>In the world of organizational structures, the options you have to choose from include things like chain of command (long or short?), span of control (wide or narrow?), and centralization (centralized or decentralized decision-making?), just to name a few.</p> \n<div class=\"hsg-featured-snippet\"> \n <h2>Organizational Structure</h2> \n <p>An organizational structure is a visual diagram of a company that describes what employees do, whom they report to, and how decisions are made across the business. Organizational structures can use functions, markets, products, geographies, or processes as their guide, and cater to businesses of specific sizes and industries.</p> \n</div> \n<p>What's the point of an organizational structure? As a business leader, do you even need one? As I said, org structures help you define at least three key elements of how your business is going to run.</p> \n<p>As your company gets bigger, an organizational structure can also be helpful for new employees as they learn who manages what processes at your company.</p> \n<p>Then, if you need to pivot or shift your leadership, you can visualize how the work flows would work by adjusting your organizational structure diagrams.</p> \n<p>To put it simply, this chart like a map that simply explains how your company works and how its roles are organized.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Here's what each of those elements means to an organization:</p> \n<h3>Chain of Command</h3> \n<p>Your chain of command is <strong>how</strong> tasks are delegated and work is approved. An org structure allows you to define how many \"<a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/corporate-ladder.asp\">rungs of the ladder</a>\" a particular department or business line should have. In other words, who tells whom to do what? And how are issues, requests, and proposals communicated up and down that ladder?</p> \n<h3>Span of Control</h3> \n<p>Your span of control can represent two things: <strong>who</strong> falls under a manager's, well, management ... and which tasks fall under a department's responsibility.</p> \n<h3>Centralization</h3> \n<p>Centralization describes <strong>where</strong> decisions are ultimately made. Once you've established your chain of command, you'll need to consider which people and departments have a say in each decision. A business can lean toward centralized, where final decisions are made by just one or two entities; or decentralized, where final decisions are made within the team or department in charge of carrying out that decision.</p> \n<p>You might not need an org structure right away, but the more products you develop and people you hire, the harder it'll be to lead your company without this crucial diagram.</p> \n<p>(To dive deeper into what all of these different organizational structure components are, check out my earlier post, \"<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/organizational-structure-building-blocks\">The 6 Building Blocks of Organizational Structure</a>.\")</p> \n<div> \n <p class=\"p1\"></p> \n</div> \n<p>In this post, we'll explore how you can combine those components to form different types of organizational structures. We'll also highlight the benefits and drawbacks of different structure types so you can evaluate which is the best option for your company, division, or team. Let's dive in.</p> \n<h2>Mechanistic vs. Organic Organizational Structures</h2> \n<p>Organizational structures fall on a spectrum, with \"mechanistic\" at one end and <br>\"organic\" at the other.</p> \n<p>Take a look at the diagram below. As you'll probably be able to tell, the mechanistic structure represents the traditional, top-down approach to organizational structure, whereas the organic structure represents a more collaborative, flexible approach.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-2160422824-jpg/offers/org-charts-mechanistic-vs-organic-blog.jpg?width=669&amp;name=org-charts-mechanistic-vs-organic-blog.jpg\" alt=\"Mechanistic vs organic organizational structure, compared in two diagrams side by side\" width=\"669\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<p>Here's a breakdown of both ends of the structural spectrum, their advantages and disadvantages, and which types of businesses are suited for them.</p> \n<h3>Mechanistic Structure</h3> \n<p>Mechanistic structures, also called <a href=\"https://smallbusiness.chron.com/bureaucratic-organization-20379.html\">bureaucratic structures</a>, are known for having narrow spans of control, as well as high centralization, specialization, and formalization. They're also quite rigid in what specific departments are designed and permitted to do for the company.</p> \n<p>This organizational structure is much more formal than organic structure, using specific standards and practices to govern every decision the business makes. And while this model does hold staff more accountable for their work, it can become a hindrance to the creativity and agility the organization needs to keep up with random changes in its market.</p> \n<p>As daunting and inflexible as mechanistic structure sounds, the chain of command, whether long or short, is always clear under this model. As a company grows, it needs to make sure everyone (and every team) knows what's expected of them. Teams collaborating with other teams <em>as needed</em> might help get a business off the ground in its early stages, but sustaining that growth -- with more people and projects to keep track of -- will eventually require some policymaking. In other words, keep mechanistic structure in your back pocket ... you never know when you'll need it.</p> \n<h3>Organic Structure</h3> \n<p>Organic structures (also known as \"flat\" structures) are known for their wide spans of control, decentralization, low specialization, and loose departmentalization. What's that all mean? This model might have multiple teams answering to one person and taking on projects based on their importance and what the team is capable of -- rather than what the team is designed to do.</p> \n<p>As you can probably tell, this organizational structure is much less formal than mechanistic, and takes a bit of an ad-hoc approach to business needs. This can sometimes make the chain of command, whether long or short, difficult to decipher. And as a result, leaders might give certain projects the green light more quickly but cause confusion in a project's division of labor.</p> \n<p>Nonetheless, the flexibility that an organic structure allows for can be extremely helpful to a business that's navigating a fast-moving industry, or simply trying to stabilize itself after a rough quarter. It also empowers employees to try new things and develop as professionals, making the organization's workforce more powerful in the long run. Bottom line? Startups are often perfect for organic structure, since they're simply trying to gain brand recognition and get their wheels off the ground.</p> \n<p>Now, let's uncover more specific types of organizational structures, most of which fall on the more traditional, <strong>mechanistic</strong> side of the spectrum.</p> \n<div class=\"hsg-featured-snippet\"> \n <h2>Types of Organizational Structure</h2> \n <ol> \n  <li>Functional Organizational Structure</li> \n  <li>Product-Based Divisional Structure</li> \n  <li>Market-Based Divisional Structure</li> \n  <li>Geographical Divisional Structure</li> \n  <li>Process-Based Structure</li> \n  <li>Matrix Structure</li> \n  <li>Circular Structure</li> \n  <li>Flat Structure</li> \n  <li>Network Structure</li> \n </ol> \n</div> \n<h3>1. Functional Organizational Structure</h3> \n<p>One of the most common types of organizational structures, the functional structure departmentalizes an organization based on common job functions.</p> \n<p>An organization with a functional org structure, for instance, would group all of the marketers together in one department, group all of the salespeople together in a separate department, and group all of the customer service people together in a third department.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-2245840802-jpg/org-charts-functional-blog-1.jpg?width=669&amp;name=org-charts-functional-blog-1.jpg\" width=\"669\" alt=\"Blue diagram of functional organizational structure\"></p> \n<p>The functional structure allows for a high degree of specialization for employees, and is easily scalable should the organization grow. Also this structure is mechanistic in nature -- which has the potential to inhibit an employee's growth -- putting staff in skill-based departments can still allow them to delve deep into their field and find out what they're good at.</p> \n<h4>Disadvantages</h4> \n<p>Functional structure also has the potential to create barriers between different functions -- and it can be inefficient if the organization has a variety of different products or target markets. The barriers created between departments can also limit peoples' knowledge of and communication with other departments, especially those that depend on other departments to succeed.</p> \n<h3>2. Product-Based Divisional Structure</h3> \n<p>A divisional organizational structure is comprised of multiple, smaller functional structures (i.e. each division within a divisional structure can have its own marketing team, its own sales team, and so on). In this case -- a product-based divisional structure -- each division within the organization is dedicated to a particular product line.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-2157030208-jpg/offers/org-charts-product-blog.jpg?width=669&amp;name=org-charts-product-blog.jpg\" alt=\"Green diagram of product-based divisional organizational structure\" width=\"669\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<p>This type of structure is ideal for organizations with multiple products and can help shorten product development cycles. This allows small businesses to go to market with new offerings fast.</p> \n<h4>Disadvantages</h4> \n<p>It can be difficult to scale under a product-based divisional structure, and the organization could end up with duplicate resources as different divisions strive to develop new offerings.</p> \n<h3>3. Market-Based Divisional Structure</h3> \n<p>Another variety of the divisional organizational structure is the market-based structure, wherein the divisions of an organization are based around markets, industries, or customer types.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-2161299342-jpg/offers/org-charts-market-blog.jpg?width=669&amp;name=org-charts-market-blog.jpg\" alt=\"Pink diagram of market-based divisional organizational structure\" width=\"669\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<p>The market-based structure is ideal for an organization that has products or services that are unique to specific market segments, and is particularly effective if that organization has advanced knowledge of those segments. This organizational structure also keeps the business constantly aware of demand changes among its different audience segments.</p> \n<h4>Disadvantages</h4> \n<p>Too much autonomy within each market-based team can lead to divisions developing systems that are incompatible with one another. Divisions might also end up inadvertently duplicating activities that other divisions are already handling.</p> \n<h3>4. Geographical Divisional Structure</h3> \n<p>The geographical organizational structure establishes its divisions based on -- you guessed it -- geography. More specifically, the divisions of a geographical structure can include territories, regions, or districts.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-2160255986-jpg/offers/org-charts-geography-blog.jpg?width=669&amp;name=org-charts-geography-blog.jpg\" alt=\"Yellow diagram of geographical divisional organizational structure\" width=\"669\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<p>This type of structure is best-suited to organizations that need to be near sources of supply and/or customers (e.g. for deliveries or for on-site support). It also brings together many forms of business expertise, allowing each geographical division to make decisions from more diverse points of view.</p> \n<h4>Disadvantages</h4> \n<p>The main downside of a geographical org structure: It can be easy for decision- making to become decentralized, as geographic divisions (which can be hundreds, if not thousands of miles away from corporate headquarters) often have a great deal of autonomy. And when you have more than one marketing department -- one for each region -- you run the risk of creating campaigns that compete with (and weaken) other divisions across your digital channels.</p> \n<h3>5. Process-Based Structure</h3> \n<p>Process-based organizational structures are designed around the end-to-end flow of different processes, such as \"Research &amp; Development,\" \"Customer Acquisition,\" and \"Order Fulfillment.\" Unlike a strictly functional structure, a process-based structure considers not only the activities employees perform, but also how those different activities interact with one another.</p> \n<p>In order to fully understand the diagram below, you need to look at it from left to right: The customer acquisition process can't start until you have a fully developed product to sell. By the same token, the order fulfillment process can't start until customers have been acquired and there are product orders to fill.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-2160256091-jpg/offers/org-charts-process-blog.jpg?width=669&amp;name=org-charts-process-blog.jpg\" alt=\"Orange diagram of process-based organizational structure\" width=\"669\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<p>Process-based organizational structure is ideal for improving the speed and efficiency of a business, and is best-suited for those in rapidly changing industries, as it is easily adaptable.</p> \n<h4>Disadvantages</h4> \n<p>Similar to a few other structures on this list, process-based structure can erect barriers between the different process groups. This leads to problems communicating and handing off work to other teams and employees.</p> \n<h3>6. Matrix Structure</h3> \n<p>Unlike the other structures we've looked at so far, a matrix organizational structure doesn't follow the traditional, hierarchical model. Instead, all employees (represented by the green boxes) have dual reporting relationships. Typically, there is a functional reporting line (shown in blue) as well as a product- based reporting line (shown in yellow).</p> \n<p>When looking at a matrix structure org chart, solid lines represent strong, direct-reporting relationships, whereas dotted lines indicate that the relationship is secondary, or not as strong. In our example below, it's clear that functional reporting takes precedence over product-based reporting.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-2131681595-jpg/offers/org-charts-matrix-blog.jpg?width=669&amp;name=org-charts-matrix-blog.jpg\" alt=\"Teal diagram of matrix organizational structure\" width=\"669\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<p>The main appeal of the matrix structure is that it can provide both flexibility and more balanced decision-making (as there are two chains of command instead of just one). Having a single project overseen by more than one business line also creates opportunities for these business lines to share resources and communicate more openly with each other -- things they might not otherwise be able to do regularly.</p> \n<h4>Disadvantages</h4> \n<p>The primary pitfall of the matrix organizational structure? Complexity. The more layers of approval employees have to go through, the more confused they can be about who they're supposed to answer to. This confusion can ultimately cause frustration over who has authority over which decisions and products -- and who's responsible for those decisions when things go wrong.</p> \n<h3>7. Circular Structure</h3> \n<p>While it might appear drastically different from the other organizational structures highlighted in this section, the circular structure still relies on hierarchy, with higher-level employees occupying the inner rings of the circle and lower-level employees occupying the outer rings.</p> \n<p>That being said, the leaders or executives in a circular organization aren't seen as sitting atop the organization, sending directives down the chain of command. Instead, they're at the center of the organization, spreading their vision outward.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-2161339582-jpg/offers/org-charts-circular-blog.jpg?width=669&amp;name=org-charts-circular-blog.jpg\" alt=\"Multi-colored diagram of circular organizational structure\" width=\"669\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<p>From an ideological perspective, a circular structure is meant to promote communication and the free flow of information between different parts of the organization. Whereas a traditional structure shows different departments or divisions as occupying individual, semi-autonomous branches, the circular structure depicts all divisions as being part of the same whole.</p> \n<h4>Disadvantages</h4> \n<p>From a practical perspective, the circular structure can be confusing, especially for new employees. Unlike with a more traditional, top-down structure, a circular structure can make it difficult for employees to figure out who they report to and how they're meant to fit into the organization.</p> \n<h3>8. Flat Structure</h3> \n<p>While a more traditional organizational structure might look more like a pyramid -- with multiple tiers of supervisors, managers and directors between staff and leadership, the flat structure limits the levels of management so all staff are only a few steps away from leadership. It also might not always take the form or a pyramid, or any shape for that matter. As we mentioned earlier, It's also a form of the \"Organic Structure\" we noted above.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202019-08-15%20at%204.01.59%20PM.png?width=256&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202019-08-15%20at%204.01.59%20PM.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-08-15 at 4.01.59 PM\" width=\"256\" style=\"width: 256px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">This structure is probably one of the most detailed, It's also thought that employees can be <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2013/11/hierarchy-is-overrated\">more productive</a> in an environment where there's <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jul/30/no-bosses-managers-flat-hierachy-workplace-tech-hollywood\">less hierarchy-related pressures</a>. This structure might also make staff feel like the managers they do have are more like equals or team members rather than intimidating superiors.</p> \n<h4>Disadvantages</h4> \n<p>If there's a time when teams in a flat organization disagree on something, such as a project, it can be hard to get aligned and back on track without executive decisions from a leader or manager. Because of how complicated the structure's design is, it can be tricky to determine which manager an employee should go to if they need approval or an executive decision for something. So if you do choose to have a flat organization, you should have a clearly marked tier of management or path that employers can refer to when they run into these scenarios.</p> \n<h3>9. Network Structure</h3> \n<p>A network structure is often created when one company works with another to share resources -- or if your company has multiple locations with different functions and leadership. You might also use this structure to explain your company workflows if much of your staffing or services is outsourced to freelancers or multiple other businesses.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The structure looks nearly the same as the Divisional Structure, shown above. However, instead of offices, it might list outsourced services or satellite locations outside of the office.</p> \n<p>If your company doesn't do everything under one roof, this is a great way to show employees or stakeholders how outsourcing of off-site processes work. For example, if an employee needs help from a web developer for a blogging project and the company's web developers are outsourced, the could look at this type of chart and know which office or which person to contact outside of their own work location.</p> \n<h4>Disadvantages</h4> \n<p>The shape of the chart can vary based on how many companies or locations you're working with. If it's not kept simple and clear, there may be a lot of confusion if multiple offices or freelancers do similar things. If you do outsource or have multiple office locations, make sure your org chart clearly states where each specific role and job function lies so someone can easily understand your basic company processes.&nbsp;</p> \n<h2>Navigating Organizational Structures</h2> \n<p>That concludes our exploration of different types of organizational structures. Keep in mind that what we've just looked at are simply archetypes -- in real-world applications, organizations often use hybrid structures, which can borrow elements from multiple structure types.</p> \n<p>Want to see some real-world examples of marketing team org structures from companies like GitHub and Rue La La?

You're not posting pictures skydiving in Australia -- you're posting pictures of your brunch. However, you could be more marketable than you think.</p> \n<p>Instagram has become an insanely popular channel for brands to promote their products. In fact, Influencer Central found consumers consider Instagram to be the <a href=\"http://influence-central.com/social-upends-traditional-media-in-driving-shopping-purchases/\">sixth most effective</a> at influencing their purchasing decisions.</p> \n<p>Instagram's popularity might make you feel the platform is already too crowded for you to stand out. But here's the thing -- brands are quickly realizing the power of normal people to promote their products. Micro-influencers, or people with a small number of followers compared to the big players, see <a href=\"https://shanebarker.com/blog/benefits-working-with-micro-influencers/\">the most engagement out of their audience</a>.</p> \n<p>Think of it this way: I'm going to trust my best friend's advice over Kim Kardashian's when I'm purchasing a product. I trust my best friend, we share similar interests, and I know she's genuine with her advice (no offense, Kim … ).</p> \n<p>It's the same concept for micro-influencers -- with the right strategy, your audience will begin to see you as one of their real friends. The more they trust your advice when seeking out purchasing decisions, the more likely you are to get sponsored.</p> \n<p>Here, we're going to show you everything you need to do to get sponsored on Instagram, even if you currently have zero followers. Keep reading to get started or click the links below to jump to a specific section of this article.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-get-sponsored-instagram#howto\">How to Get Sponsored on Instagram</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-get-sponsored-instagram#post\">What's a Sponsored Instagram Post?</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-get-sponsored-instagram#hashtags\">Using #ad and #spon Hashtags</a></li> \n</ul> \n<p><a></a></p> \n<p></p> \n<h3>1. Define your brand.</h3> \n<p>You'll see the best engagement if you're able to define your niche. Do you want to post food and health related content, or focus on fashion? Whatever the case, it's important to establish your brand.</p> \n<p>Besides the type of content you post, branding has a lot to do with your overall aesthetic. How do you want to style your posts? What's your messaging? To further solidify your brand, you might want to consider creating a cohesive feed theme (use <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/instagram-themes\">these feeds for inspiration</a>).</p> \n<p>Specificity is key. A good influencer's posts are distinguishable and unique -- when a user is flipping through her feed, she'll be able to pause and recognize every time she sees a post from that influencer. As she continues to see similar content, she'll grow to trust that brand as an expert in the field. If the influencer suddenly and randomly changed course, the user might not understand or trust the content anymore.</p> \n<p>Additionally, you might want to connect your Instagram brand with an online presence. Creating a website with similar aesthetic and messaging is a good way to do this -- the more you unify your social media accounts, the easier it will be for brands to distinguish how you can help them.</p> \n<h3>2. Know your audience.</h3> \n<p>Knowing your audience is critical for convincing a brand to work with you. It's mutually beneficial for you, as well -- if you understand your audience, you're able to correctly identify which brands will see the most success from using you as their sponsor.</p> \n<p>Start by gathering the basics -- what is the gender, age, and geographical location of your core demographic? Which of your posts do they like the best? What times of day do they respond best to content, and what can you infer from this?</p> \n<p>The demographic information you gather will help you pitch partnerships with brands. Brands want to know who they can reach if they work with you. Explaining \"You'll be reaching thirty-something, working women, primarily from New York, who often use Instagram first thing in the morning and prefer fitness content\" is certainly more powerful than saying, \"You'll be reaching women.\"</p> \n<h3>3. Post consistently.</h3> \n<p>CoSchedule <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/how-often-to-post-on-social-media/\">gathered research from 14 studies</a> to identity how often you should post on social media sites. For Instagram, they found you should post a minimum of once a day, but can post upwards of three times a day.</p> \n<p>CoSchedule <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/how-often-to-post-on-social-media/\">also found</a> 8:00 AM to 9:00 AM, and 2:00 AM, are the best times to post.</p> \n<p>To grow your following, it's critical you post at least once a day. Instagram's <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-does-the-instagram-algorithm-work\">algorithm favors new and fresh content</a>, and you don't want your audience to unfollow you or forget about you from lack of consistency.</p> \n<p>However, you'll need to figure out what works best for you and your audience. Perhaps your audience feels bombarded when you post three times a day, or maybe they prefer it. Maybe your audience engages most with your posts at noon. It will take some trial and error, as well as <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/instagram-analytics-tools\">Instagram metrics tools</a>, to figure this out.</p> \n<h3>4. Use hashtags and geotags.</h3> \n<p>Hashtags make your content more discoverable, so they're necessary for growing your following. You can use up to 30 hashtags per post, but <a href=\"https://www.socialmediatoday.com/social-networks/new-report-looks-optimal-hashtag-use-twitter-instagram-and-facebook\">TrackMaven found nine to be the optimal number</a> for boosting engagement.</p> \n<p>You'll want to use hashtags as relevant to your content as possible. You'll also need to check to make sure the hashtags you use aren't broken or banned (take a look at this list of <a href=\"https://thepreviewapp.com/list-of-banned-instagram-hashtags-2018/\">banned hashtags</a> if you're unsure).</p> \n<p>It's critical you choose hashtags that aren't too broad. #Healthyliving, for instance, has over 20,000,000 posts, while #healthylivingtips only has 13,000. The less competition, the easier it will be for your content to get discovered.</p> \n<p>When you peruse a hashtag's page, you can also get a deeper sense of what types of content your post will be up against. #Healthylivingtips might typically feature posts with food recipes, while your post is about cycling -- this could defer you from using that hashtag.</p> \n<p>Geotags are equally important, but for a different reason. Geotags can help people find you if they're interested in a certain location. This helps you gain more followers, and it also helps you appeal to brands that are interested in reaching a certain demographic. For instance, maybe a boutique sees you often post fashion tips from the California area, and they're looking to appeal to people in that region -- it's a win, win.</p> \n<h3>5. Tag brands in your posts.</h3> \n<p>Okay, now you're officially ready to begin reaching out to brands. You've defined your brand and audience and have created some quality, authentic posts. Now, you should have a pretty good idea what types of businesses would benefit from a partnership with you.</p> \n<p>It's important to start small. If you're interested in skincare, don't go straight for Estee Lauder -- instead, try tagging small skincare start-ups you've seen across Instagram already.</p> \n<p>Let's take a look at an example -- @Tzibirita, a travel influencer, posted this image of herself wearing a Paul Hewitt watch. The image is high-quality and fits with her brand, and she tags @paul_hewitt in her description. Even if you're not paid by Paul Hewitt, you can still post the same type of content and tag their brand in the post. Ideally, it will at least put you on their radar.</p> \n<div> \n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/How%20to%20Get%20Sponsored%20on%20Instagram%20(Even%20if%20You%20Currently%20Have%200%20Followers).png\" alt=\"\"> </img>\n</div> \n<p>Begin with small brands and tag them in your descriptions. Engage with your audience by responding to comments like \"Where can I get one?\" or \"How much?\" and the brand will soon see you've proven yourself a suitable sales partner.</p> \n<h3>6. Include contact information in your bio.</h3> \n<p>Consider your bio a chance to signal to brands your interest in becoming an influencer. Include an email or website so they can reach you, and include a press kit if possible.</p> \n<p>For instance, @tzibirita doesn't waste her bio space. She includes her email and website, and even adds a title -- \"content creator\". Brands will have no doubt she's open to doing business with them.</p> \n<div> \n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/How%20to%20Get%20Sponsored%20on%20Instagram%20(Even%20if%20You%20Currently%20Have%200%20Followers)-1.png\" alt=\"\">Furthermore, you should use a website or blog as your chance to expand on your brand and demonstrate your versatility. Consider adding a Press Page to your website, so brands can take a look at your services. Once you begin sponsoring brands, you can add them to this page so brands can see you have influencer experience. </img>\n</div> \n<h3>7. Pitch paid sponsorships.</h3> \n<p>There's nothing wrong with reaching out to brands and offering your services. With the right pitch, you might be able to land some gigs without waiting for brands to find you.</p> \n<p>Look for brands that clearly invest time and money into their Instagram presence. You might start by researching what similar influencers in your industry already sponsor. Remember, it's okay to start small. Working with smaller brands will allow you to build a portfolio.</p> \n<p>Once you've curated a list of brands that might want to partner with you, send them an email. In your pitch, clearly and briefly outline who you are, what you do, and any achievements you have in the field that make you an expert. Then, explain why you're a good fit for the brand, and include data such as follower count and average engagement rate.</p> \n<p>Alternatively, you might consider sending a brand a DM straight from Instagram. It's certainly more relevant to the job you're vying for, but it might get lost if a brand get hundreds of DMs a day.</p> \n<h3>8. Know your worth.</h3> \n<p>Make sure you know how much you're going to charge when brands reach out to you. The <a href=\"https://www.thattravelblog.com/blog/quick-start-guide-to-get-paid-for-your-instagram-posts\">industry standard is $10 for 1,000 followers</a>, but it could also vary depending on how many likes you get per post. Additionally, as you grow, you'll be able to charge more.</p> \n<p>While you'll want to have a minimum set, you can negotiate to encourage brands to pay more. Perhaps for $300, you'll throw in five Instagram Story posts, and a link in your bio to their website for 24 hours. You can use other Instagram features to sweeten the deal.</p> \n<p>Once you have your pricing structure nailed down, you'll need to know how to sponsor a post on behalf of the brand you're working with. Now, keep in mind there are two different kinds of \"sponsored\" posts: those for which brands pay <em>Instagram</em>, and those for which brands pay <em>another user</em>.</p> \n<p>Confused? Here's what I mean:</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>What's a Sponsored Instagram Post?</h2> \n<p>A sponsored post on Instagram is paid for by the poster to reach a wider audience. There are two main types of sponsorships: In one, a brand creates a post and pays Instagram for access to a custom audience. In the other, a brand sponsors another Instagram user -- often called an \"Influencer\" -- who creates a post that features the brand in some way.</p> \n<p>Here's more detail on each type of sponsored post:</p> \n<h3>Promoted Posts &amp; Ads</h3> \n<p>Just like Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook, Instagram comes with a native ad management platform. Advertisers can use this tool to customize a target audience -- using attributes like age, sex, location, and interests -- and invest a specific amount of money to getting their post in front of Instagrammers who identify with this audience.</p> \n<p>The thing to remember here is that the advertiser is making and publishing the post. They're paying Instagram for the audience they want access to, but the post is theirs to create.</p> \n<h3>Paid Sponsorships</h3> \n<p>Paid sponsorships take place between a brand and another Instagram user. Typically, this user has a personal brand and attracts an audience of his or her own. This user is often called an \"influencer.\"</p> \n<p>This person can then use the steps explained earlier in this article to find and work with brands that appeal to a similar audience. When they find a brand who wants to sponsor them, they can charge this client a certain amount to create a post that features their product or service. Think of it like social media product placement; just like a business might pay a TV show to have their brand of soda on the countertop in the series finale, they can also pay a person on Instagram to hold that same soda in a picture on their Instagram feed.</p> \n<p>Clearly there are more creative sponsorship ideas you can come up with -- I decided to go with a cliché ...</p> \n<p>Influencers are similar to Instagram's ad manager in the sense that they both draw an audience that brands might not otherwise have access to. However, the differences in this type of sponsorship are that the brand is paying the influencer -- rather than Instagram -- for access to their audience, and the influencer -- rather than the advertiser -- is the one creating and publishing the post.</p> \n<p>There are numerous influencers for each industry. <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/instagram-influencers\">Here's a big list of today's known influencers</a> and the types of audiences they attract.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>Using #ad and #spon Hashtags</h2> \n<p>In the past couple years, brands have come under fire for hiring influencers but not making it clear to the audience that these influencers were getting paid.</p> \n<p>Department store Lord &amp; Taylor, for instance, <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2016/03/15/lord--taylor-settles-ftc-charges-over-paid-instagram-posts/81801972/\">settled charges with the FTC in 2016</a> after paying 50 influencers to wear a dress in their posts without hashtagging #sponsorship or #ad.</p> \n<p>Influencers are supposed to hashtag #ad or #sponsored in posts they're being paid for, but these tags make some brands uncomfortable because it makes the post appear inauthentic.</p> \n<p>In 2017, Instagram <a href=\"https://business.instagram.com/blog/tagging-and-insights/\">released a paid partnership feature</a> to combat this issue -- if you tag a brand in a post and the brand confirms the relationship, the ad will be marked at the top with a \"paid partnership\" label. This also helps the brand gather data regarding how well the campaign is performing.</p> \n<p>It's critical your followers know if you're getting paid to promote a product. Ethics aside, it could destroy your account's credibility if you're caught, and lose everything you've worked hard to build -- namely, an authentic, trusting community.</p> \n<p>If you truly don't want to post #ad or #spon, there are some ways around it -- for instance, Airbnb created the hashtag #Airbnb_partner, to signal a paid partnership without using the word \"ad\".</p> \n<p>When in doubt, adhere to Instagram's policies. You can read Instagram's branded content policies in full <a href=\"https://help.instagram.com/116947042301556\">here</a>.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, getting sponsored on Instagram isn't easy -- it takes time, effort, and perseverance.

Is it engaging? Too short? Too long? Too boring? Will people click 'delete' because of it? Or will they open it? Will it even get to them, or will it trigger SPAM filters? It's the last of these concerns that we're here to help with today.&nbsp; </p> \n<p>SPAM filters can be triggered for a variety of reasons, causing your email to skip recipients' inboxes and land straight in their SPAM box. One of easiest ways to avoid SPAM filters is by carefully choosing the words you use in <a title=\"your email's subject line\" href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/best-email-subject-lines-list\">your email's subject line</a>. Trigger words are known to cause problems and increase the chances of your email getting caught in a SPAM trap. By avoiding these words in your email subject lines, you can dramatically increase your chances of getting beyond SPAM filters.</p> \n<p>Next time you sit down to write an email subject line, consult the exhaustive list below and make sure you aren't using any words that will get you in trouble. In fact, you might want to bookmark this list so you can refer back to it every time you craft an email subject line.

found out the Tooth Fairy wasn't real. My whole world was shattered. Granted, I was about eight, but I was furious to find out that <em>my </em><em>parents </em>had been putting a quarter under my pillow every time I'd lost a tooth, not a sweet fairy named Daphne who lived in a castle made out of my pearly whites.</p> \n<p>Luckily, believing in the Tooth Fairy is pretty harmless. Other myths, especially those that affect your business, are not.</p> \n<p>In previous posts, we've debunked myths about <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/insiders/marketing-automation-facts\">marketing automation</a>, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33734/20-Common-Social-Media-Marketing-Myths-BUSTED.aspx\">social media</a>, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/blogging-myths-ht\">blogging</a>, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33926/7-Common-SEO-Myths-to-Throw-Out-the-Window-Immediately.aspx\">SEO</a>, and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/34254/11-Common-A-B-Testing-Myths-BUSTED.aspx\">A/B testing</a>... but we've never touched on <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/best-landing-page-builder\">landing pages</a>.</p> \n<p>Keep reading so you don't miss out on information that'll help you convert visitors into leads and leads into customers. We'll debunk the most common landing page myths and arm you with information to take your landing pages to the next level.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h2><strong>Myth #1: You only need a few of them.</strong></h2> \n<p>Lots of people think that you don't need many landing pages. Maybe you have a 'Contact Us' page and a demo page, and that's pretty much it, right? Wrong. If you only have a few landing pages, you're missing out on traffic, leads, and customers <em>big time.</em></p> \n<p>Every new landing page you create is another opportunity for you to appear in search engines and get your link shared on social media -- and better search engine rankings and social media posts mean that you'll have more opportunity to drive traffic and conversions for your website.</p> \n<p>Additionally, besides landing pages on your website, you're going to need landing pages to convert leads. These pages are probably not available on search engines, but will help you track how many leads have clicked into an offer and how many have downloaded your content offers.</p> \n<p>Need more convincing about the importance of having more landing pages? <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33756/Why-You-Yes-You-Need-to-Create-More-Landing-Pages.aspx\">Check out this post.</a></p> \n<h2><strong>Myth #2:</strong><strong>Short forms are better than long forms.</strong></h2> \n<p>No <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/forms\">form</a> length is the \"best\" -- it all depends on what you're trying to accomplish with the form. Are you trying to get a ton of new leads? Keep the form short. Are you trying to get really qualified leads? Make the form longer. One is not better than the other -- they just address different goals.</p> \n<p>Your form length will most likely end up somewhere in the middle. To find <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/32079/How-Long-Should-Your-Landing-Page-Forms-Be.aspx\">your form length sweet spot</a>, run A/B tests and adjust your form length according to their results.</p> \n<h2><strong>Myth #3:</strong><strong>If I copy someone else's landing page, my conversion rates will go up.</strong></h2> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/landing-page-examples-list\">Landing page examples</a> and templates are great jumping off points for your own landing pages, but you shouldn't expect to plug your content into someone else's landing page and end up raking in the conversions. A landing page is successful because of interaction of many nuanced elements -- the content on the page, the design of the page, and the audience viewing the page.</p> \n<p>If you're going to copy a landing page layout, use best practices to <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/conversion-centered-design\">tweak it to help</a> <em>your</em> audience convert on <em>your</em> offer, then test it and test it to make it better.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, a landing page will only succeed if the content offer matches the intent of the customer.</p> \n<h2><strong>Myth #4:</strong><strong>You need to have all conversion elements above the fold.</strong></h2> \n<p>Lots of people believe that all of the important content on your landing page should appear above the fold -- supposedly, people won't scroll to fill out the form or find out more crucial information about what lies behind the form.</p> \n<p>But the fold doesn't really affect conversion -- <a href=\"https://blog.kissmetrics.com/why-the-fold-is-a-myth/\">KISSmetrics found</a> that when people are motivated to convert on a page, they do, regardless of where the form submit button is. According to that article, the biggest factor in increasing motivation is compelling copy, regardless of length. So forget optimizing <em>only</em> for the fold -- through A/B testing, figure out how much information people need to convert.</p> \n<h2><strong>Myth #5: Trust seals always increase conversions.</strong></h2> \n<p>Think about the situations in which you often see trust seals. You're usually giving over your credit card number or some other sensitive contact information, right? It makes sense to get a little visual reminder that your information is safe, because you really are giving over sensitive information.</p> \n<p>But what if you saw a trust seal on a page where you <em>weren't </em>giving over sensitive information? It'd be out-of-place, making you wonder what the heck the company was really collecting from you, right? Trust elements can help tremendously on pages that need them -- but they can also deter folks if they're included on pages that don't.</p> \n<h2><strong>Myth #6: If you change your form button from green to red, you'll increase conversions.</strong></h2> \n<p>Full disclosure: <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/20566/The-Button-Color-A-B-Test-Red-Beats-Green.aspx\">we've run this test</a> and found that a red call-to-action (CTA) outperformed a green CTA ... but that doesn't mean that red buttons are <em>always</em> better than green ones. That test worked for that page, with that page's design, for that page's audience. If you run the same test on your site, you might find that the opposite is true.</p> \n<p>This myth goes for any color test really --<strong>there is no one <em>right</em> color that'll convert tons and tons more people</strong>. Test out colors yourself to see what works best.</p> \n<h2><strong>Myth #7: Landing page copy should <em>always</em> be short and sweet.</strong></h2> \n<p>Like color, there's no right length of landing page copy. We kind of touched on this in Myth #4, but the copy length myth is perpetuated enough it deserved a section of its own.</p> \n<p>Landing page copy length is like what your teachers would say when you'd ask them how long an essay should be -- however long it needs to be to cover the subject. In the case of landing pages, it should be however long you need it to be to have people convert on your landing page's form. For complex offers that require people ponying up a lot of money or their sensitive information, more information could be better. For simple offers, like an ebook, you probably don't need a ton of landing page copy.</p> \n<p>Like almost all of these myths, this one's nuanced. Run tests on your landing pages to find out what copy length your visitors need.</p> \n<h2><strong>Myth #8: Conversion rate is the only metric to watch.</strong></h2> \n<p>Landing pages are a stepping stone in your marketing funnel. You're not just trying to get people to fill out a form. You'd hope that eventually they'll become a customer from you.</p> \n<p>So if you're trying to get the most out of your landing pages, you shouldn't just look at the percent of people who converted on that form -- you want to look and see what happens after.</p> \n<p>What percentage of them become customers? By looking at your <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/definition-closed-loop-analytics-under-100-words-sr\">closed-loop analytics</a>, you may find that a landing page that has a low initial conversion rate actually brings in customers like crazy, or vice versa ... which is something your boss would care to know and fix.</p> \n<h2><strong>Myth #9: You should include as many things as possible on your landing page to get people to convert on <em>something</em>.</strong></h2> \n<p>Your landing page isn't a last-ditch effort to capture someone's information. It's there to get people to convert on your form and move down your marketing funnel. You don't want to give people too many options because they'll get distracted and your conversion rate goes down. This means you should <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/landing-page-navigation-ht\">try removing your navigation </a>and any extraneous forms. More is not better when it comes to landing page elements.</p> \n<h2><strong>Myth #10: You build 'em and leave 'em.</strong></h2> \n<p>You could probably guess this last myth from one piece of advice I've repeated over and over throughout this post: Test your landing pages. There are almost always ways you can tweak and improve them. If you build them and leave them alone, you're losing out on valuable conversions. Landing pages support the backbone of your marketing funnel -- so make sure you're getting the most you can out of them by running A/B tests often.</p> \n<p>Building a landing page can feel like a daunting task with the contradictory advice out there. That's why you should use a <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/landing-pages\">landing page builder</a> to assist you.</p> \n<p><em>Editor's note: This post was originally published in March 2014 and has been updated for comprehensiveness.</em></p> \n<p><em></em></p> \n<p><em></em></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Flanding-page-myths-list&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 13 Nov 2020 12:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"a4f91e6fc23bf48ad60bfbc8f54c6f1d","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"gsoskey@hubspot.com (Ginny Mineo)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Flanding-page-myths-list&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn6@2020_6/2020/11/14/17-30-25-101_bffbcbd64f5d4549.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605375018181},{"createdTime":"2020-11-15 01:30:18","updatedTime":"2020-11-15 01:30:18","title":"YouTube SEO: How to Optimize Videos for YouTube Search","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/youtube-seo","description":"<p>As recently as a decade ago, inbound marketing was a brand new idea. Marketers were learning that they couldn't just publish a high volume of content -- it also had to be high-quality and optimized in ways that made it as discoverable as possible through search engines.</p> \n<p>That content was once largely limited to the written word. Today, that's no longer the case.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Today, a comprehensive content strategy includes written work like blogs and ebooks, <em>as well as</em> media like podcasts, visual assets, and videos.</p> \n<p>That last part -- video -- continues to be on the rise. According to the 2018 <a href=\"http://stateofinbound.com/\">State of Inbound</a> report, 45% of marketers are investing more in YouTube over the course of this year -- more than any other marketing channel available to them.</p> \n<p>And with the rise of other content formats comes the need to optimize them for search. One increasingly important place to do that is on YouTube, a video distribution website used by the masses -- HubSpot included.</p> \n<div class=\"hs-embed-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; height: auto; padding: 0px; max-width: 560px; max-height: 315px; min-width: 256px; display: block; margin: auto;\"> \n <div class=\"hs-embed-content-wrapper\"> \n  <div style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 0px;\"> \n   <iframe width=\"480\" height=\"270\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pNnMBwS4Bdc?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe> \n  </div> \n </div> \n</div> \n<p>But how does YouTube SEO work? What are the steps you need to take to optimize your YouTube channel for search? We've outlined some major tips and tools below.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\"></p> \n<div class=\"hsg-featured-snippet\"> \n <h2>YouTube SEO Tips</h2> \n <ol> \n  <li>Rename your video file using a target keyword.</li> \n  <li>Insert your keyword naturally in the video title.</li> \n  <li>Optimize your video description.</li> \n  <li>Tag your video with popular keywords that relate to your topic.</li> \n  <li>Categorize your video.</li> \n  <li>Upload a custom thumbnail image for your video's result link.</li> \n  <li>Use an SRT file to add subtitles &amp; closed captions.</li> \n  <li>Add Cards and End Screens to increase your YouTube channel's viewership.</li> \n </ol> \n</div> \n<h3>1. Rename your video file using a target keyword.</h3> \n<p>Just like you would when optimizing written content, you'll use an SEO tool to first identify keywords you'd like your video to focus on (you can browse popular <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/youtube-seo#tools\">YouTube SEO tools</a> below these tips, or just click that link earlier in this sentence).</p> \n<p>With a keyword identified, the first place you should put it is your video file -- before you even upload it to YouTube. Why? YouTube can't actually \"watch\" your video to see how relevant it is to your target keyword, and as you'll learn in the tips below, there are only so many places you can safely insert this keyword on your video's viewing page once it's published. But, YouTube <em>can</em> read your video's file name and all the code that comes with it when it's uploaded.</p> \n<p>With that in mind, replace the \"business_ad_003FINAL.mov\" file name (don't be embarrassed ... we've all been there during post-production) with your desired keyword. If your keyword is \"house painting tips,\" for example, your video's file name should be \"house-painting-tips\" followed by your preferred video file type (MOV, MP4, and WMV are some of the most common that are compatible with YouTube).</p> \n<h3>2. Insert your keyword naturally in the video title.</h3> \n<p>When we search for videos, one of the first things that our eyes are drawn to is the title. That's often what determines whether or not the viewer will click to watch your video, so the title should not only be compelling, but also clear and concise.</p> \n<p>Although your keyword plays a big part in your video title, it also helps if the title closely matches what the viewer is searching for. Research conducted by Backlinko found that videos with an exact keyword match in the title have only a slight advantage over those that don't. Here's a linear representation of those findings:</p> \n<img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/exact-match-title.png?width=669&amp;name=exact-match-title.png\" alt=\"exact-match-title.png\" width=\"669\" title=\"exact-match-title.png\" style=\"width: 669px;\"> <span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><em>Source: <a href=\"http://backlinko.com/youtube-ranking-factors\">Backlinko</a></em></span> <p>So, while \"using your target keyword in your title may help you rank for that term,\" report author <a href=\"http://backlinko.com/youtube-ranking-factors\">Brian Dean</a> explains, \"the relationship between keyword-rich video titles and rankings\" isn't always a strong one. Nonetheless, it's a good idea to optimize your title for this keyword so long as it fits naturally into a title that tells viewers exactly what they're about to see.</p> <p>Lastly, make sure to keep your title fairly short -- HubSpot campaigns manager <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/aliciacollins/\">Alicia Collins</a> recommends limiting it to 60 characters to help keep it from getting cut off in results pages.</p> <h3>3. Optimize your video description.</h3> <p>First things first: According to <a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/3027950?hl=en\">Google</a>, the official character limit for YouTube video descriptions is 1,000 characters. And while it's okay to use all of that space, remember that your viewer most likely came here to watch a video, not to read an essay.</p> <p>If you do choose to write a longer description, keep in mind that YouTube only displays the first two or three lines of text -- that amounts to about 100 characters. After that point, viewers have to click \"show more\" to see the full description. That's why we suggest front-loading the description with the most important information, like CTAs or crucial links.</p> <p>As for optimizing the video itself, it doesn't hurt to add a transcript of the video, especially for those who have to watch it without volume. That said, Backlinko's research also found no <a href=\"http://backlinko.com/youtube-ranking-factors\">correlation between descriptions that were optimized for a certain keyword and the rankings for that term</a>.</p> <img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/keyword-in-description.png?width=669&amp;name=keyword-in-description.png\" alt=\"keyword-in-description.png\" width=\"669\" title=\"keyword-in-description.png\" style=\"width: 669px;\"> <span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><em>Source: <a href=\"http://backlinko.com/youtube-ranking-factors\">Backlinko</a></em></span> <p>Dean is careful <em>not</em> to encourage ditching an optimized description altogether, though. \"An optimized description helps you show up in the suggested videos sidebar,\" he writes, \"which is a significant source of views for most channels.\"</p> <h3>4. Tag your video with popular keywords that relate to your topic.</h3> <p>YouTube's official <a href=\"https://creatoracademy.youtube.com/page/lesson/discovery#yt-creators-strategies-2\">Creator Academy</a> suggests using tags to let viewers know what your video is about. But you're not just informing your viewers -- you're also informing YouTube itself. Dean explains that the platform uses tags \"to understand the content and context of your video.\"</p> <p>That way, YouTube figures out how to associate your video with similar videos, which can broaden your content's reach. But choose your tags wisely. Don't use an irrelevant tag because you think it'll get you more views -- in fact, Google might <a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/7002331?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=4355198\">penalize</a> you for that. And similar to your description, lead with the most important keywords, including a good mix of those that are common and more long-tail (as in, those that answer a question like \"how do I?\").</p> <h3>5. Categorize your video.</h3> <p>Once you upload a video, you can categorize it under \"Advanced settings.\" Choosing a category is another way to group your video with similar content on YouTube so it winds up in different playlists and gains exposure to more viewers who identify with your audience.</p> <p>It might not be as simple as it looks. In fact, YouTube's <a href=\"https://creatoracademy.youtube.com/page/lesson/overview-categories?cid=platform&amp;hl=en#yt-creators-strategies-2\">Creator Academy</a> suggests marketers go through a comprehensive process to determine which category each video belongs in. It's helpful, the guide writes, \"to think about what is working well for each category\" you're considering by answering questions like:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Who are the top creators within the category? What are they known for and what do they do well?</li> \n   <li>Are there any patterns between the audiences of similar channels within a given category?</li> \n   <li>Do the videos within a similar category have share qualities like production value, length, or format?</li> \n  </ul> <h3>6. Upload a custom thumbnail image for your video's result link.</h3> <p>Your video thumbnail is the main image viewers see when scrolling through a list of video results. Along with the video's title, that thumbnail sends a signal to the viewer about the video's content, so it can impact the number of clicks and views your video receives.</p> <p>While you can always pick one of the thumbnail options auto-generated by YouTube, we highly recommend uploading a custom thumbnail. The Creator Academy reports that \"<a href=\"https://creatoracademy.youtube.com/page/lesson/thumbnails#yt-creators-strategies-1\">90% of the best performing videos on YouTube have custom thumbnails</a>,\" recommending the use of images that are 1280x720 pixels -- representing a 16:9 ratio -- that are saved as 2MB or smaller .jpg, .gif, .bmp, or .png files. If you follow those parameters, it can help to ensure that your thumbnail appears with equally high quality across multiple viewing platforms.</p> <p>It's important to note that your YouTube account has to be <em>verified</em> in order to upload a custom thumbnail image. To do that, visit <a href=\"http://youtube.com/verify\">youtube.com/verify</a> and follow the instructions listed there.</p> <h3>7. Use an SRT File to add subtitles &amp; closed captions.</h3> <p>Like much of the other text we've discussed here, subtitles and closed captions can boost YouTube search optimization by highlighting important keywords.</p> <p>In order to add subtitles or closed captions to your video, you'll have to upload a supported text transcript or timed subtitles file. For the former, you can also directly enter transcript text for a video so that it auto-syncs with the video.</p> <p>Adding subtitles follows a similar process, however, you can limit the amount of text you want displayed. For either, head to your video manager then click on \"Videos\" under \"Video Manager.\" Find the video you want to add subtitles or closed captioning to, and click the drop-down arrow next to the edit button. Then, choose \"Subtitles/CC.\" You can then select how you'd like to add subtitles or closed captioning.</p> <p>Find out how to add closed captions to your YouTube video in the video below.</p> \n  <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"width: 100%; height: auto; position: relative; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; min-width: 256px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin: 0px auto;\"> \n   <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 59.38%; margin: 0;\"> \n    <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe hs-fullwidth-embed\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/h-HlBPx8ek4\" width=\"640\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n   </div> \n  </div> <h3>8. Add Cards and End Screens to increase your YouTube channel's viewership.</h3> <h4 class=\"p1\">Cards</h4> <p>When you're watching a video, have you ever seen a small white, circular icon with an \"i\" in the center appear in the corner, or a translucent bar of text asking you to subscribe? Those are Cards, which <a href=\"https://creatoracademy.youtube.com/page/lesson/cards?cid=get-discovered&amp;hl=en#yt-creators-strategies-1\">Creator Academy</a> describes as \"preformatted notifications that appear on desktop and mobile which you can set up to promote your brand and other videos on your channel.\"</p> <img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202017-05-25%20at%206.02.40%20PM.png?width=641&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202017-05-25%20at%206.02.40%20PM.png\" alt=\"&quot;i&quot; icon to create End Cards in YouTube video \" width=\"641\" title=\"Screen Shot 2017-05-25 at 6.02.40 PM.png\" style=\"width: 641px;\"> <span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><em>Source: <a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6140493?hl=en\">Google</a></em></span> <p>You can add up to five cards to a single video, and there are six types:</p> \n   <ol> \n    <li>Channel cards that direct viewers to another channel.</li> \n    <li>Donation cards to encourage fundraising on behalf of U.S. nonprofit organizations.</li> \n    <li>Fan funding to ask your viewers to help support the creation of your video content.</li> \n    <li>Link cards, which direct viewers to an external site, approved crowdfunding platform, or an approved merchandise selling platform.</li> \n    <li>Poll cards, which pose a question to viewers and allow them to vote for a response.</li> \n    <li>Video or playlist cards, which link to other YouTube content of this kind.</li> \n   </ol> <p>For detailed steps on adding a card to your video, follow these <a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6140493?hl=en\">official steps</a> from Google, or check out the video below.</p> \n   <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"width: 100%; height: auto; position: relative; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; min-width: 256px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin: 0px auto;\"> \n    <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 59.38%; margin: 0;\"> \n     <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe hs-fullwidth-embed\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/-Sex3r_CNWU\" width=\"640\" height=\"380\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n    </div> \n   </div> <h4>End Screens</h4> <p>End screens display similar information as cards, but as you may have guessed, they don't display until a video is over, and are a bit more visually detailed in nature. A good example is the overlay with a book image and a visual link to view more on the video below:</p> <img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202017-05-25%20at%206.09.28%20PM.png?width=669&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202017-05-25%20at%206.09.28%20PM.png\" alt=\"End screens displayed on a YouTube video\" width=\"669\" title=\"Screen Shot 2017-05-25 at 6.09.28 PM.png\" style=\"width: 669px;\"> <span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><em>Source: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyB_GZNpCQE\">Jamie Oliver on YouTube</a></em></span> <p>There are a number of detailed instructions for adding end screens depending on what kind of platform you want to design them for, as well as different types of content allowed for them by YouTube.

In those cases, you can create topic clusters that have both blog <em>and</em> YouTube content belonging to them.</p> <p>Clustering your content -- and linking from videos to blog posts, and vice-versa -- can give you more authority in the eyes of Google and YouTube, while giving you more ways to capture traffic from the people searching your topic.</p> <h3>4. <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vidiq-vision-for-youtube/pachckjkecffpdphbpmfolblodfkgbhl?hl=en\">vidIQ Vision</a></h3> <p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/vidiq-vision-for-youtube.png?width=500&amp;name=vidiq-vision-for-youtube.png\" alt=\"vidiq-vision-for-youtube\" width=\"500\" style=\"width: 500px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">This is a Chrome extension, available through Chrome's web store in the link above, that helps you analyze how and why certain YouTube videos perform so well.

It's not like you start out aimlessly. You have a simple goal in mind, like cropping a photo, improving the resolution, or changing the size of the canvas. But then, you look at how many options there are -- and trying to figure out which buttons to press to execute a single task suddenly turns into an attempt to solve The Riddle of the Sphinx.</p> \n<p>Wouldn't it be nice if you could just press a button, and magically, do what you wanted to do? Well, we've got good news for you: It turns out there are a wealth of Photoshop shortcuts that pretty much work just that way.</p> \n<p>By pressing a few keys on your computer keyboard at the same time, you can select tools, manipulate images and layers, and even make adjustments to your project's canvas. But if we're being honest, if you're just starting out with the software, there might be far too many Photoshop shortcuts to remember them all. That's why we created this guide -- for you to bookmark and return to next time your design project leaves you stumped.</p> \n<p><strong>Note:</strong> All of these shortcuts can be accessed on PC and Mac, but sometimes, they're different on each operating system. We've included both types below, and in the cases where they might be different, Mac instructions appear in italicized parentheses. Also, in these formulas, the plus sign (+) is present only to represent the combination of key commands. On occasion, it might be part of the command itself, like when you press the plus sign to zoom into a part of an image, but otherwise, don't press the plus sign between commands.</p> \n<div class=\"hsg-featured-snippet\"> \n <h2>65 Photoshop Shortcuts to Save You Time</h2> \n <ol> \n  <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/photoshop-keyboard-shortcuts-list#setup\">Getting Set Up</a></li> \n  <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/photoshop-keyboard-shortcuts-list#tools\">Choosing the Right Tools</a></li> \n  <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/photoshop-keyboard-shortcuts-list#brushtool\">Using the Brush Tool</a></li> \n  <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/photoshop-keyboard-shortcuts-list#marqueetool\">Using the Marquee Tool (for Slicing/Selecting)</a></li> \n  <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/photoshop-keyboard-shortcuts-list#blendingoptions\">Using Different Blending Options</a></li> \n  <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/photoshop-keyboard-shortcuts-list#layersobjects\">Manipulating Layers &amp; Objects</a></li> \n  <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/photoshop-keyboard-shortcuts-list#savingwork\">Saving Your Work for Later</a></li> \n </ol> \n</div> \n<a></a> \n<h3>Getting Set Up</h3> \n<p>You'd think setting up your content in Photoshop would be second nature. But sometimes, the shortcuts to change the background size, or zoom into your project aren't what you think. Here are some of the most crucial fundamental shortcuts to know:</p> \n<p><strong>1) Control</strong> +<strong> Alt </strong>+<strong> i (<em>Command</em></strong><em> +<strong> Option </strong>+</em><strong><em> i </em>)</strong> = Change the image size.</p> \n<p><strong>2) Control </strong>+ <strong>Alt </strong>+ <strong>c (<em>Command</em></strong><em> +<strong> Option </strong>+</em><strong><em> c </em>)</strong> = Change canvas size.</p> \n<p><strong>3) Control </strong>+ <strong>+ (<em>Command </em></strong><em>+</em><strong><em> + </em>)</strong> = Zoom in.</p> \n<p><strong>4) Control </strong>+ <strong>- (<em>Command </em></strong><em>+</em><strong><em> - </em>)</strong> = Zoom out.</p> \n<p><strong>Control </strong>+<strong> ' (<em>Command </em></strong><em>+ </em><strong><em>' </em>)</strong> = Show or hide the <em>grid</em>, the automatically-generated horizontal and vertical lines that help align objects to the canvas.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>Choosing the Right Tools</h3> \n<p>These shortcuts will activate different groups of tools, like \"Lasso,\" \"Brush,\" or \"Spot Healing Brush.\" Within these tools, though, there are different functions. Under the \"Magic Wand\" tool group, for example, you have the option to execute a new selection or add and subtract from a current one.</p> \n<p>Each one of these tools has a keyboard shortcut, and we've outlined some of them below.</p> \n<p><strong>5) v </strong>= Pointer, a.k.a.

the size, shape, and transparency of your brush strokes to achieve a number of different visual effects. To use these keyboard shortcuts, first select the Brush tool by pressing <strong style=\"letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: transparent;\">b</strong>. <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/00-Blog-Related_Images/brush-tool.png?width=30&amp;height=23&amp;name=brush-tool.png\" alt=\"brush-tool.png\" title=\"brush-tool.png\" width=\"30\" height=\"23\" style=\"letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: transparent;\" /></p> \n<p><strong>29) , </strong>or<strong> . </strong>= Select previous or next brush style.</p> \n<p><strong>30) Shift </strong>+<strong> , </strong>or<strong> . </strong>= Select first or last brush style used.</p> \n<p><strong>31) Caps Lock or Shift </strong>+<strong> Caps Lock <em>(Caps Lock)</em></strong> = Display precise crosshair for brushes.</p> \n<p><strong>32) Shift </strong>+<strong> Alt </strong>+<strong> p<em> (Shift </em></strong><em>+</em><strong><em> Option </em></strong><em>+</em><strong><em> p)</em></strong> = Toggle airbrush option.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>Using the Marquee Tool (for Slicing/Selecting)</h3> \n<p>When used correctly, the marquee tool will let you select individual elements, entire graphics, and determine what is copied, cut, and pasted into your graphics.</p> \n<p>To use these keyboard shortcuts, first select the Marquee tool by pressing <strong>m</strong>. <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/marquee-tool-2.png?width=29&amp;height=23&amp;name=marquee-tool-2.png\" alt=\"marquee-tool-2.png\" title=\"marquee-tool-2.png\" width=\"29\" height=\"23\" /></p> \n<p><strong>33) Control <em>(Command)</em></strong> = Toggle between Slice tool and Slice Selection tool.</p> \n<p><strong>34) Shift </strong>+ <strong>drag</strong> = Draw square slice.</p> \n<p><strong>35) Alt </strong>+ <strong>drag <em>(Option </em></strong><em>+ </em><strong><em>drag)</em></strong> = Draw from center outward.</p> \n<p><strong>36) Shift </strong>+ <strong>alt</strong> + <strong>drag <em>(Shift </em></strong><em>+ <strong>option</strong> + <strong>drag) </strong></em>= Draw square slice from center outward.</p> \n<p><strong>37) Spacebar </strong>+ <strong>drag</strong> = Reposition the slice while creating the slice.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>Using Different Blending Options</h3> \n<p>Blending options include a number of features to enhance the look of your graphic. You can always choose a blending option by going to the top menu bar, under <strong>Layer</strong> &gt; <strong>Layer Style</strong> &gt; <strong>Blending Options. </strong>Or, you can double-click any layer to bring up the options for that particular layer.</p> \n<p>Once you open blending options, you can use keyboard shortcuts to select them without moving your mouse. To use the shortcuts, select the Move tool (\"<strong>v</strong>\"), and then select the layer you'd like to use the blending options on. Below are some of the most popular modes.</p> \n<p><strong>38) Shift </strong>+<strong> + </strong>or<strong> – </strong>= Cycle through blending modes.</p> \n<p><strong>39) Shift </strong>+<strong> Alt </strong>+<strong> n <em>(Shift </em></strong><em>+</em><strong><em> Option </em></strong><em>+</em><strong><em> n)</em></strong> = Normal mode</p> \n<p><strong>40) Shift </strong>+<strong> Alt </strong>+<strong> i <em>(Shift </em></strong><em>+</em><strong><em> Option </em></strong><em>+</em><strong><em> i)</em></strong> = Dissolve</p> \n<p><strong>41) Shift </strong>+<strong> Alt </strong>+<strong> k <em>(Shift </em></strong><em>+</em><strong><em> Option </em></strong><em>+</em><strong><em> k)</em></strong> = Darken</p> \n<p><strong>42) Shift </strong>+<strong> Alt </strong>+<strong> g <em>(Shift </em></strong><em>+</em><strong><em> Option </em></strong><em>+</em><strong><em> g)</em></strong> = Lighten</p> \n<p><strong>43) Shift </strong>+<strong> Alt </strong>+<strong> m <em>(Shift </em></strong><em>+</em><strong><em> Option </em></strong><em>+</em><strong><em> m)</em></strong> = Multiply</p> \n<p><strong>44) Shift </strong>+<strong> Alt </strong>+<strong> o <em>(Shift </em></strong><em>+</em><strong><em> Option </em></strong><em>+</em><strong><em> o)</em></strong> = Overlay</p> \n<p><strong>45) Shift + Alt + u <em>(Shift + Option + u)</em></strong> = Hue</p> \n<p><strong>46) Shift + Alt + t <em>(Shift + Option + t)</em></strong> = Saturation</p> \n<p><strong>47) Shift + Alt + y <em>(Shift + Option + y)</em></strong> = Luminosity</p> \n<p>For more niche blending shortcuts, check out <a href=\"https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/using/default-keyboard-shortcuts.html\">these tips</a> from Adobe.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>Manipulating Layers &amp;

Note: This step gets you one, combined layer, with all elements of that layer in separate layers below -- which is different than a traditional merge-and-flatten layers command.</p> \n<p><strong>63) Control </strong>+<strong> t <em>(Command </em></strong><em>+ <strong>t)</strong></em> = Transform your object, which includes resizing and rotating</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>And Finally -- Save Your Work for Later</h2> \n<p>Congratulations -- you've finished working on your project, and now, you want to share it with the world.

a product or service or help you assess how your brand stands out in your competitive landscape, thought-provoking, open-ended questions are <em>essential</em> to a productive discussion.</p>  \n<p>However, it's easier said than done. What can you ask beyond <em>\"</em>What do you think of our product?\" that can provoke the most useful answers?</p> \n<p>Here, we've pulled together 53 questions you can ask in your next focus group to pull the most interesting and useful insights you can out of your participants.</p> \n<p><span style=\"color: #33475b; font-family: AvenirNext, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400;\">Simply copy-and-paste the questions you like below into the notetaking template for a ready-to-go, printable document you can bring to the session.</span></p> \n<p style=\"font-size: 30px; text-align: center;\"><strong>Featured Resource: <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/market-research-kit?hubs-post_cta=body\">Market Research Focus Group Template</a></strong></p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202019-10-29%20at%203.00.45%20PM-3.png?width=566&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202019-10-29%20at%203.00.45%20PM-3.png\" width=\"566\" style=\"width: 566px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/market-research-kit?hubs-post_cta=body\">Download the Template</a></em></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">For a free template for notetaking during focus groups, a guide on conducting market research, and several other templates, download our <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/market-research-kit?hubs-post_cta=body\">Market Research Kit</a>.</p> \n<h3>Questions for Building Trust Among Focus Group Members</h3> \n<p>Before diving into deeper questions, it's best to warm up the group with a couple of open-ended questions that allow participants to get to know each other a little bit. Participants should be able to decide how much they want to share with the group -- don't force anyone to share something they may not feel comfortable sharing.</p> \n<p>By including a question that allows people to talk about something tangential to the topic of the focus group, your participants will begin to build empathy for each other. That empathy can grow into trust, which is key for eliciting honest insights out of your group.</p> \n<p>Here are a few questions you might ask to build trust:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Share an aspect of your work or life experience that's brought you here today.</li> \n <li>Why did you decide to join our focus group today?</li> \n <li>When and how did you first come across our brand/product/service?</li> \n</ul> \n<p></p> \n<h3>Questions to Encourage Follow-up and Continuation of Ideas</h3> \n<p>The most helpful insights that come out of focus groups are often the most specific points. Challenge your participants to reflect more on the points they've made if you hear something that you're curious about. For instance:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>That's a fascinating point that [name] just said -- what do you all think of that?</li> \n <li>Do you agree or disagree with [name]'s statement, and why?</li> \n <li>[Name], you've been a bit quiet recently. Did you have any thoughts on this topic that you wanted to share?</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>Questions for Understanding Customer Perception of Your Product or Service</h3> \n<p>These questions will help you understand how people <em>truly</em> feel about your brand, product, or service. The focus here is on your company -- not the larger industry landscape or your competitors.</p> \n<p>Avoid stopping conversation here unless the group gets completely sidetracked. Open-ended questions can be daunting at first. Participants may not know where to start. However, hearing from the other participants will spark reflection on various aspects of your product or service. Be sure to allow each group member who has something to say to speak up before moving on to the next question.</p> \n<ul> \n <li>How would you describe our company to other people?</li> \n <li>How would you describe our product/service to other people?</li> \n <li>What words or feelings come to mind when you think about our company?</li> \n <li>How likely are you to recommend our product/service to a friend?</li> \n <li>How well do you feel we incorporate feedback from you, our customers, into our service/product?</li> \n <li>What ultimately pushed you to purchase this product/service?</li> \n <li>Where would you buy this product/service?</li> \n <li>What do you like about this product that you may not find in a similar one?</li> \n <li>When you think about our industry, which brands come to mind first?</li> \n <li>Which other brands in our industry did you consider when you were shopping around?</li> \n <li>Why didn't you go with one of our competitors?</li> \n <li>What other products/services come to mind when you look at this one?</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>Questions to Learn What Your Leads and Customers Want to See From You</h3> \n<p>Listening to your customers' feedback and suggestions for improvement is crucial to retaining customers and turning them into promoters of your brand. It may be difficult to hear the answers to these questions, but turning customer pain points around will elevate your product or service to the next level.</p> \n<p>Avoid defending your product or service or setting any limitations on these questions. Instead, frame them in a way that allows anyone to voice anything at all that they're feeling. Recognize that it can be daunting for anyone (especially people with whom you've built relationships) to share negative feedback, so thank them for their candor.</p> \n<ul> \n <li>If you could wave a magic wand and change one thing about our product/service, what would it be?</li> \n <li>What would you most like to add to or improve about this product?</li> \n <li>What do you envision is the lifespan of this product/service before you upgrade or replace it?</li> \n <li>Is there anything we haven't touched on today that you'd like us to know?</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>Questions for Understanding Your Buyer Personas</h3> \n<p>The following eight questions will help you understand what motivates your target <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/buyer-persona-research\">buyer persona</a>, their habits, their responsibilities and decision-making power, and their preferences.</p> \n<p>These questions are written to spark discussion about topics other than your company, product or service, and the competitive landscape.</p> \n<p>Don't worry if the conversation seems to stray far from your brand, as the insights that people end up sharing will likely reveal what's significant to them in their life and work. However, it's important you keep the group focused on the specific question you've asked.</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Describe your job title and your day-to-day responsibilities.</li> \n <li>What's one task on which you feel you spend way too much time?</li> \n <li>How do you define success in your role/your life?</li> \n <li>What is the biggest challenge you face in your role/when it comes to the problem to which this product is a solution?</li> \n <li>When you're browsing online, on which websites do you spend most of your time?</li> \n <li>What are the first three apps you open on your phone in the morning?</li> \n <li>How do you prefer to receive communications from our company? (Specify what type of communication here -- product updates, renewal notices, product/service coaching, meeting reminders, urgent alerts, etc.)</li> \n <li>Would you be the one using this product/service most in your household/job? If not, who would be?</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>Questions for Getting a Better Sense of the Competitive Landscape</h3> \n<p>These questions are intended to spark discussion about the brands in your industry that are top-of-mind for consumers. These are helpful in removing any biases that you and your team might have as people who work in the industry and know various players very well.</p> \n<p>To encourage honesty, avoid agreeing with any disparaging comments that your participants make about your competitors. Instead, use the opportunity to ask follow-up questions about exactly what the participants don't like about a specific product or brand.</p> \n<p>If you're looking to do a complementary research-based analysis of your competitors, download our <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/market-research-kit?hubs-post_cta=body\">Market Research Kit</a> to gain access to a S.W.O.T. analysis template.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/53%20Focus%20Group%20Questions%20for%20Any%20Purpose-1.png\" alt=\"\">\n</div> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/market-research-kit?hubs-post_cta=body\">Download the Template</a></em></p> \n<h3>Questions for Generating Content on Your Industry</h3> \n<p>You might be looking to <a href=\"https://academy.hubspot.com/courses/content-strategy\">develop a content strategy</a> for your brand, branch out into a new content medium, or simply generate new content ideas. Any successful content strategy prioritizes what's most engaging and interesting for your target buyer persona, so a focus group can be an effective way to be sure that you're producing material on the right topics and in the medium that your audience wants to consume.</p> \n<ul> \n <li>What is one recent trend you've noticed in our industry?</li> \n <li>What's one strategy or tactic you think is underrated in our industry?</li> \n <li>Where do you go to get a pulse on the things going on in our industry?</li> \n <li>Who are the people in our industry who you look to as experts?</li> \n <li>What format of content do you consume to keep up with our industry? Social media posts? Blogs/long-form posts? Podcasts? News outlets?</li> \n <li>Which specific sources do you go to for information on our industry?</li> \n <li>What gaps do you see in the content about our industry online? What are the topics on which you'd like to see more education?</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>Questions for Understanding Product Demand for Something You Haven't Yet Put Out in the Market</h3> \n<p>These eleven questions are intended to help you understand the demand for a new product or service. These questions will uncover buying habits for a product like the one you're envisioning and whether there's true product-market fit.</p> \n<ul> \n <li>What is/was your first reaction to the product?</li> \n <li>How often do you/would you use this type of product?</li> \n <li>Would you be the one deciding to purchase this product/service? If not, who would be?</li> \n <li>When and where do you use our product?</li> \n <li>When you think about the product, do you think of it as something you absolutely need, something you could do without, or something that's somewhere in the middle?</li> \n <li>How much would you be willing to pay for a product like this?</li> \n <li>How would you ideally like to buy this product? Would you talk to a sales rep, or would you rather purchase it on your own?</li> \n <li>What do you think this product is missing?</li> \n <li>How would you describe someone who you think would use this product/service?</li> \n <li>If you ended up liking your experience with this product, could you see yourself repurchasing it? If so, how often?</li> \n <li>If you could either have this product/service or the equivalent dollar value for you/your business, which would you choose? Why? (Specify the dollar value of your product/service when asking this question.)</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>Questions for Establishing (or Re-establishing) Your Name and Branding</h3> \n<p>The following questions are helpful for running word association brainstorms and generating potential names or parts of names for a new product or company.</p> \n<ul> \n <li>What words come to mind when you think of our product category?

I know they need to look nice, but figuring out how to make them aesthetically pleasing and informative is tough.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>I’m sure my experience isn’t unique, as finding the correct balance between content, design, and timing can be difficult. Marketers know this more than anyone, as success in the role is often marked by being able to create engaging campaigns that tell a story and inspire audiences to take a specific action, like purchasing a product.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>However, PowerPoint presentations are different from advertisements. Understanding how to leverage your marketing knowledge when creating PowerPoints can be tricky. Still, there are various resources for marketers to use when creating presentations, one of which is the 10/20/30 rule.&nbsp;</p> \n <p></p> \n <p></p> \n <p>Coined by Guy Kawasaki, the rule is a tool for marketers to create excellent PowerPoint presentations. Each element of the formula helps marketers find a balance between design and conceptual explanations, so you can capture audience attention, emphasize your points, and enhance readability.&nbsp;</p> \n</div> \n<h2>Guy Kawasaki PowerPoint</h2> \n<p><a href=\"https://guykawasaki.com/\">Guy Kawasaki</a>, one of the early Apple employees, championed the concept of a ‘brand evangelist’ to describe his position. He spent most of his time working to generate a follower base for Macintosh, the family of Apple computers. Today he works as a brand evangelist for Canva, an online graphic design tool.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Given that he’s had significant experience giving presentations to captivate audiences, he’s figured out that the <a href=\"https://guykawasaki.com/the_102030_rule/\">10/20/30</a> is a successful formula to follow. Kawasaki’s book, <a href=\"https://guykawasaki.com/books/the-art-of-the-start/\">Art of The Start</a>, is where he first introduced the concept and described how it works.</p> \n<p>Let’s cover each part of the rule in more detail.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>10 Slides</h3> \n<p>Kawasaki believes that it’s challenging for audiences to comprehend more than ten concepts during a presentation. Given this, marketers should aim to create PowerPoints with no more than ten slides, i.e., ten ideas you’ll explain. Using fewer slides and focusing on the critical elements helps your audience grasp the concepts you’re sharing with them.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In practice, this means creating slides that are specific and straight to the point. For example, say you’re presenting on the success of your recent campaign. Your marketing strategy was likely extensive, and you took a series of different actions to obtain your end result. Instead of outlining every aspect of your campaign, you would use your slides to outline its main elements of your strategy. This could look like individual slides for summarizing the problem you hoped to solve, your goals, the steps you took to reach your goals, and post-campaign analytics data that summarizes your accomplishments.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>It’s important to note that there shouldn’t be overwhelming amounts of text on your slides. You want them to be concise. Your audience should get most of the information from the words you’re speaking; your slides should be more supplemental than explanatory.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>20 Minutes</h3> \n<p>After you’ve spent time coming up with your ten key points, you’ll need to present them in 20 minutes. Knowing that you’ll only have 20 minutes also makes it easier to plan and structure your talk, as you’ll know how much time to dedicate to each slide, so you address all relevant points.</p> \n<p>Kawasaki acknowledges that presentation time slots can often be longer, but finishing at the 20-minute mark leaves time for valuable discussion and Q&amp;A. Saving time in your presentation also leaves space for technical difficulties.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>30 Point Font</h3> \n<p>If you’ve been in the audience during a presentation, you probably know that slides with small font can be challenging to read and take your attention away from the speaker.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Kawasaki’s final rule is that no font within your presentation should be smaller than 30 point size. If you’ve already followed the previous rules, then you should be able to display your key points on your slides in a large enough font that users can read. Since your key points are short and focused, there won’t be a lot of text for your audience to read, and they’ll spend more time listening to you speak.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Given that the <a href=\"https://www.digitalauthority.me/resources/ada-compliant-font-size/#:~:text=What's%20the%20right%20size%20font,font%20for%20the%20body%20text.\">average recommended font size</a> for accessibility is 16, using a 30-point font ensures that all members of your audience can read and interact with your slides.&nbsp;</p> \n<h2>Make Your Presentations More Engaging</h2> \n<p>The 10/20/30 rule of PowerPoint is meant to help marketers create powerful presentations.&nbsp;</p> \n<p class=\"hs-migrated-cms-post\">Each element of the rule works in tandem with the other: limiting yourself to 10 slides requires you to select the most salient points to present to your audience. A 20-minute timeline helps you ensure that you’re contextualizing those slides as you speak, without delving into unnecessary information. Using a 30-point font can act as a final check for your presentation, as it emphasizes the importance of only displaying key points on your slides, rather than huge blocks of text. Font size then circles back around to the ten slides, as you’ll craft sentences from your key points that will fit on your slides in 30-point font.&nbsp;</p> \n<p class=\"hs-migrated-cms-post\">Being mindful of slide count, text size, and presentation length ensures that your audiences are captivated by your words as you explain the value behind your work.&nbsp;</p> \n<p class=\"hs-migrated-cms-post\"></p> \n<p class=\"hs-migrated-cms-post\">  </p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fblog%2Ftabid%2F6307%2Fbid%2F1056%2Fsteve-jobs-guy-kawasaki-powerpoint-best-practices.aspx&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 12 Nov 2020 12:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"775ac25bb5e7d660f8d604fc6f7c94cd","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"bhalligan@hubspot.com (Brian Halligan)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fblog%2Ftabid%2F6307%2Fbid%2F1056%2Fsteve-jobs-guy-kawasaki-powerpoint-best-practices.aspx&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn17@2020_2/2020/11/14/17-30-24-428_93ac085e0bd011aa.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605375018184},{"createdTime":"2020-11-15 01:30:18","updatedTime":"2020-11-15 01:30:18","title":"How to Tell a Compelling Brand Story [Guide + Examples]","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/brand-story","description":"<p>Last year, a buzzword ripped through the content marketing space that most marketers were surprisingly thrilled about and eager to implement. Shockingly, it didn’t start with “virtual” or end with “intelligence”. Instead, it was what attracted most marketers to the industry in the first place -- \"storytelling\".</p>  \n<p>Content marketing’s steady adoption of storytelling is an exciting new opportunity for content creators.&nbsp;The human brain is <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/the-strange-thing-that-happens-in-you-brain-when-you-hear-a-good-story-and-how-to-use-it-to-your-advantage\">wired to respond to well-crafted narrative</a> -- neuroscience proves that storytelling is the best way to capture people’s attention, bake information into their memories, and forge close, personal bonds. Your audience is programmed to crave and seek out great stories -- that’ll never change.</p> \n<p>However,&nbsp;since we’ve spent the majority of our careers optimizing content for algorithms, it can be challenging to flex a creative muscle that’s slowly withered away from inactivity and, in turn, move people emotionally and sear your brand into their memories.</p> \n<p>So, to help you strengthen that creative muscle and write compelling stories again, we’ve created a guide about the fundamentals of brand story structure and provided examples of three small-to-medium sized businesses who have leveraged their brand story to resonate with huge audiences, despite their comparatively small size.</p> \n<p></p> \n<div class=\"hsg-featured-snippet\"> \n <h2>What is a brand story?</h2> \n <p>A brand story recounts the series of events that sparked your company’s inception and expresses how that narrative still drives your mission today. Just like your favorite books and movies’ characters, if you can craft a compelling brand story, your audience will remember who you are, develop empathy for you, and, ultimately, care about you.</p> \n</div> \n<p>When HubSpot first started, we noticed traditional, interruptive marketing didn’t appeal to consumers anymore. Due to the digital age, people were in complete control of the information they consumed -- and they were sick and tired of receiving direct mail, email blasts, and cold calls. People wanted to be helped, so we started creating educational content that aided people in solving their marketing problems.</p> \n<p>Today, we’ve built a passionate community of inbound marketers, expanded our inbound marketing approach to the sales and customer service industries, and strengthened the inbound movement more than ever before.</p> \n<p>This our brand story -- a simple, digestible narrative that&nbsp;explains&nbsp;why HubSpot began, and how this reason still serves as our purpose today.</p> \n<h2>How to Write a Brand Story</h2> \n<h3>1. Highlight your story’s conflict.</h3> \n<p>Check out the following story. Does it resonate with you?</p> \n<p>A girl wearing a red-hooded cloak is strolling through the woods to give her sick grandma some much-needed food and TLC. She passes by a wolf on the way. They exchange a slightly awkward soft smile-nod combination that random colleagues usually greet each other with as they pass in the hallway. She makes it to her grandma’s house without a scratch. They eat lunch and play a game of Clue together. Grandma wins by deducing that Colonel Mustard killed Mr. Boddy in the Billiard Room with the candlestick -- what a shocker! The End.</p> \n<p>So ... what’d you think? Did this story keep you on the edge of your seat? Or does it feel … off? For some reason, it doesn’t work, right? That’s because there’s no conflict. Despite the intense game of Clue at the end, there’s nothing at stake. There’s no tension. The wolf didn’t try to eat the girl. He didn’t even go to Grandma’s house. He barely acknowledged Little Red Riding Hood.</p> \n<p>At their core, stories are about overcoming adversity. So if there’s no conflict presented, there’s no drama or emotional journey that people can relate to. And if your story has no drama or emotional journey, it won’t hold anyone’s attention -- let alone resonate with and inspire them.</p> \n<p>Unfortunately, in the business world, brands are horrified to reveal any adversity or conflict they’ve faced. They believe that spinning a rosy, blemish-free story about how their company only experiences hockey stick growth will convince people that they’re the industry’s best-in-class solution. Any adversity or conflict during their company’s history will expose their imperfections, deterring potential customers from buying their product.</p> \n<p>But, in reality, this is a huge misconception. Nothing’s perfect. Everything, including companies (<em>especially</em> companies), has flaws. Plus, people don’t relate to perfection. They relate to the emotional journey of experiencing adversity, struggling through it, and, ultimately, overcoming it. Because, in a nutshell, that’s the story of life.</p> \n<p>Conflict is key to telling compelling stories. So be transparent about the adversity your company has faced, and own it. The more honest you are about your shortcomings, the more people will respect you and relate to your brand.</p> \n<h3>2. Don’t forget about your story’s status quo and resolution.</h3> Conflict isn’t the only thing you should focus on when crafting your brand story. A compelling story has two other fundamental elements -- the status quo and resolution. \n<p>The status quo is the way things are or the initial nature of your situation. The conflict disrupts this situation and puts something at stake, forcing the protagonist (your brand) to actively find a solution to this problem. The resolution describes how the protagonist solves the problem, giving your audience an emotional payoff.</p> \n<p>In sum, your brand’s story structure should look like this -- status quo, conflict, and resolution. It’s as simple as that.</p> \n<p>If you need an example to crystalize brand story structure in your mind, let’s go over the actual Little Red Riding Hood story, as well as some brands who are nailing their brand stories right now.</p> \n<h4>Little Red Riding Hood</h4> \n<p><strong>Status Quo:</strong> Little Red Riding Hood walks through the woods, on her way to deliver food to her sick grandma.</p> \n<p><strong>Conflict:</strong> A Big Bad Wolf approaches her, and asks where she’s going. She naively tells him where her grandmother’s house is, so he suggests she picks some flowers as a present for her. While she’s distracted, he breaks into Little Red Riding Hood’s grandmother's house, eats her, and puts on her clothes to impersonate her.</p> \n<p>When Little Red Riding Hood gets to her grandmother’s house, she notices some subtle changes in her grandmother appearance but ultimately ignores them and hops into bed with her. The wolf swallows her whole. He falls asleep from a massive food coma.</p> \n<p><strong>Resolution:</strong> A hunter hears Little Red Riding Hood’s screams, bursts through grandma’s door, and cuts open the wolf’s stomach, setting Little Red Riding Hood and her grandmother free. They then fill the wolf’s body with heavy stones, and when he wakes up and tries to run away, he topples over and dies.</p> \n<p>Now -- wouldn’t you say that was a little more compelling and entertaining than finding out Colonel Mustard can wield a candlestick as a murder weapon? I would, too.</p> \n<p>The thing is, some small brands are leveraging this same exact story structure to generate massive amounts of brand awareness and affinity. Read on to find out exactly how they do it.</p> \n<div class=\"hsg-featured-snippet\"> \n <h2>Brand Story Examples</h2> \n <ol> \n  <li>Unthinkable Media</li> \n  <li>Grado Labs</li> \n  <li>Drift</li> \n </ol> \n</div> \n<h3>1.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.unthinkablemedia.com/\">Unthinkable Media</a></h3> \n<p>Unthinkable Media is a creative agency that produces original, narrative-driven podcasts for B2B brands. Their mission is to create refreshing, entertaining shows for clients that can actually retain people’s attention, not just acquire it.</p> \n<p>Here’s a rundown of their brand story, which is also fleshed out in one of the founder’s <a href=\"http://jayacunzo.com/blog/one-simple-story-better-brand-storytelling\">blog posts</a>:</p> \n<p><strong>Status Quo:</strong> As makers and marketers, we want our audience’s attention, and so for years, we focused our efforts on acquiring it.</p> \n<p><strong>Conflict:</strong> But today, thanks to multiple screens, ubiquitous and instantly accessible content, and endless choice in nearly every competitive niche, the buyer now has total control. They only choose experiences they genuinely enjoy. It is no longer enough for us to simply acquire our audience's attention.</p> \n<p><strong>Resolution:</strong> We need to hold it. That is our new mandate as makers and marketers. We need to shift our focus from impressions and traffic to subscribers and community. Everything we are trying to achieve becomes possible and gets easier when our audience spends minutes or even hours with us, not seconds. Don't just acquire attention. Hold it.</p> \n<h3>2.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://gradolabs.com/\">Grado Labs</a></h3> \n<p>Grado Labs is a third-generation, family-owned headphone and cartridge company. They don’t believe in advertising, have operated in the same building for over a century, and even make their headphones by hand. So why do they choose to operate like this when huge brands like Beats by Dre, Sony, and Bose have celebrity endorsers and mass-produce their headphones? Check out our interpretation of their brand story to find out.</p> \n<p><strong>Status Quo:</strong> Music is an essential part of the human experience. Without it, life just isn’t as colorful and exciting. And we believe quality headphones amplify the pleasant, emotional experience of listening to music.</p> \n<p><strong>Conflict:</strong> In a market where every headphone brand has an enormous advertising budget, state-of-the-art facilities, and high-tech machines that can churn out as much product as they want, all of which we don’t have, why do we choose to not conform?</p> \n<p><strong>Resolution:</strong> Sound comes first. We’re craft-driven creators, meaning we prioritize producing the best product over generating the most hype. And by creating a better pair of headphones at the expense of publicity and growth, we can serve our customers better and foster a fervent passion for our product.</p> \n<h3>3.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.drift.com/\">Drift</a></h3> \n<p>Drift is a conversational marketing platform that helps businesses connect with prospects through genuine, empathetic conversations and interactions. In 2016, <a href=\"https://www.drift.com/blog/forms-vs-conversations-data/\">they shocked the content marketing world</a> by scrapping arguably the most reliable lead generator from their website -- forms.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.drift.com/blog/unlock-unprecedented-growth/\">Even though they were initially anxious</a> about getting rid of a lead generation machine, they knew ungating every piece of content on their website would allow them to align with their mission, put their customers first, and offer as much value as possible, which would produce better long-term results. Here’s our interpretation of their brand story.</p> \n<p><strong>Status Quo:</strong> The crux of content marketing is treating people like humans. So, we’ve done what most other companies have done: created content that aims to help and educate our customers. And in exchange for adding value to their lives, customers are likely to return the favor with their attention, trust, and action.</p> \n<p><strong>Conflict:</strong> But as much as we preach about putting the customer first, we don’t practice it. Instead of offering the most value we possibly can, we make people give us their contact information in exchange for the very thing we promise is free. Then, with their contact information, we email and call them until they either unsubscribe or eventually buy. No one actually enjoys filling out forms, becoming a lead, and getting nurtured. Our ulterior motive is crystal clear. So are we actually being customer-centric?</p> \n<p><strong>Resolution:</strong> Let’s get rid of all our forms. If we really want to practice what we preach -- putting our customers first and providing a more human and empathetic marketing experience -- we should offer all of our content for free, with no strings attached.</p> \n<h3>Tell your brand’s real story, not it’s highlight reel.</h3> \n<p>Whether you’re publishing your brand story on your website or using it to inform your overall mission, make sure it’s fact, not fiction. Spitting out a highlight reel, like almost every other brand does, won’t actually resonate with people. Instead, it's crucial you tell the honest truth about the adversity your company has faced, and how you’re working to overcome it. Because what people relate to and get inspired by isn’t endless success -- it’s the rocky journey of pursuing a goal, getting knocked down, and, ultimately, finding a path toward success.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fbrand-story&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 04 Nov 2020 18:27:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"6e5d4019bcd2cd9ad34fd9a4d3769f50","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"cchi@hubspot.com (Clifford Chi)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fbrand-story&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn6@2020_6/2020/11/14/17-30-24-186_875c253fa2507219.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605375018204},{"createdTime":"2020-11-15 01:30:18","updatedTime":"2020-11-15 01:30:18","title":"The Ultimate Guide to B2B Marketing in 2020","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/b2b-marketing","description":"<p>Effective marketing is difficult to get right.

Here are a few examples of B2C companies:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>An e-commerce company that sells office supplies to remote or self-employed individuals (like <a href=\"https://www.poppin.com/\">Poppin</a>)</li> \n <li>A store that sells t-shirts and other clothing and accessories (like <a href=\"https://www.target.com/\">Target</a>)</li> \n <li>A music platform that sells streaming subscriptions (like <a href=\"https://www.spotify.com/\">Spotify</a>)</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Take a look at this chart comparing B2B and B2C customers.</p> \n<table style=\"width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td style=\"width: 33.3333%;\">&nbsp;</td> \n   <td style=\"width: 33.3333%;\"><strong>for b2b marketing</strong></td> \n   <td style=\"width: 33.3333%;\"><strong>for b2c marketing</strong></td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td style=\"width: 33.3333%;\"><strong>Goal</strong></td> \n   <td style=\"width: 33.3333%;\">Customers are focused on ROI, efficiency, and expertise.</td> \n   <td style=\"width: 33.3333%;\">Customers are seeking deals and entertainment (which means marketing needs to be more <em>fun</em>).</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td style=\"width: 33.3333%;\"><strong>Purchase Motivation</strong></td> \n   <td style=\"width: 33.3333%;\">Customers are driven by logic and financial incentive.</td> \n   <td style=\"width: 33.3333%;\">Customers are driven by emotion.</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td style=\"width: 33.3333%;\"><strong>Drivers</strong></td> \n   <td style=\"width: 33.3333%;\">Customers want to be educated (which is where <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/b2b-marketing#b2b-content-marketing\">B2B content marketing</a> comes in).</td> \n   <td style=\"width: 33.3333%;\">Customers appreciate education but don’t always need it to make a purchase decision.</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td style=\"width: 33.3333%;\"><strong>Purchase Process</strong></td> \n   <td style=\"width: 33.3333%;\">Customers like (if not prefer) to work with account managers and salespeople.</td> \n   <td style=\"width: 33.3333%;\">Customers like to make purchases directly.</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td style=\"width: 33.3333%;\"><strong>People Involved in Purchase</strong></td> \n   <td style=\"width: 33.3333%;\">Customers often have to confer with decision makers and other members of their chain of command before making a purchase decision.</td> \n   <td style=\"width: 33.3333%;\">Customers rarely need to confer with others before making a purchase decision.</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td style=\"width: 33.3333%;\"><strong>Purchase Purpose</strong></td> \n   <td style=\"width: 33.3333%;\">Customers make purchases for long-term solutions, resulting in a longer sales cycle, longer contracts, and longer relationships with companies.</td> \n   <td style=\"width: 33.3333%;\">Customers aren’t necessarily looking for long-term solutions or long-term relationships.</td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table> \n<p>As much as they differ, though, B2B and B2C also intersect in many ways. While Poppin sells office supplies to remote or self-employed individuals, they also design corporate office spaces and branded supplies. On the flip side, Printful not only offers order fulfillment and warehousing to businesses; they also fill e-commerce printing orders for individuals.</p> \n<p>As distinct as the B2B and B2C marketing audiences can be, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/agency/b2c-campaigns-b2b-marketers-learn\">B2B marketers can always learn from B2C campaigns</a>, too.</p> \n<h2><a></a>B2B Marketing Strategies</h2> \n<p>As I said above, marketing depends on its audience. While B2B and B2C marketing vary, not every piece of B2B marketing material is alike, either.</p> \n<p>In this section, we’ll talk about various <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/b2b-customer-marketing\">B2B marketing strategies</a> you can implement to reach your <em>specific</em> business audience. Before we dive in, though, make sure you understand the B2B <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/what-is-the-buyers-journey\">buyer’s journey</a>. Take note of how each of these stages may affect your marketing strategies and how you implement them.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/b2b-marketing-buyers-journey-hubspot.png?width=600&amp;name=b2b-marketing-buyers-journey-hubspot.png\" alt=\"b2b-marketing-buyers-journey-hubspot\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<h3>B2B Email Marketing</h3> \n<p>Email marketing is a tried and true method of reaching both individual consumers and business customers. Did you know that <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/email-marketing-stats\">93% of B2B marketers</a> use email? Are you one of them? You should be. Emails lead to engagement which turns subscribers into leads … and then <em>customers</em>.</p> \n<p><em><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/free-guide-to-optimizing-email-marketing-for-conversions?hubs_post-cta=pillar_allphrase\">Download our guide to optimizing email marketing for conversions and learn how to grow your email list, ensure deliverability, and increase </a><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/free-guide-to-optimizing-email-marketing-for-conversions\">engagement</a><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/free-guide-to-optimizing-email-marketing-for-conversions\">.</a></em></p> \n<p>Unlike B2C customers who respond best to emotions and entertainment, B2B customers look for logic and positive ROI. Essentially, they’re asking themselves, <em>How can your business help my business grow?</em> Because of this, your email marketing must consistently resonate with your business customers and focus on things that matter to them — like time, money, and resources.</p> \n<p>Email marketing is also a powerful vehicle for sharing your brand’s content. <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/email-marketing-stats\">83% of B2B companies</a> use email newsletters as part of their content marketing program, and 40% of B2B marketers say these newsletters are <em>most</em> critical to their content marketing success.</p> \n<p>With the constant barrage of emails flooding our inboxes today, it’s more important than ever to create and send out effective marketing emails.</p> \n<h4>B2B Email Marketing Best Practices</h4> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Write enticing subject lines.</strong> Think about your email subject lines as a Netflix trailer — if you can’t hook your audience with a two-minute clip (or, in this case, a few dozen characters), don’t expect them to open and watch (or read) the whole thing. We recommend spending almost as much time on your email subject lines as you do on the emails themselves.</li> \n <li><strong>Stick to one call-to-action (CTA) per email.</strong> If you think the number of emails you receive is a lot, take a look at the <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics\">CTAs in those emails</a> … some are packed with two, three, and sometimes up to 10 different CTAs. Don’t make this mistake, which can leave your recipients’ heads spinning, asking “What should I click on first?” and ultimately clicking on <em>nothing</em>. With one CTA per email, you allow your audience to focus on your email content and ultimately one action … a welcome reprieve from today’s frequent decision-making and analysis paralysis.</li> \n <li><strong>Segment your email to reach the most relevant audience. </strong>Not every email you send will be appropriate for everyone on your list. Your subscribers may be at different stages of the buyer’s journey or be seeking different solutions. That’s where <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/32848/Why-List-Segmentation-Matters-in-Email-Marketing.aspx\">email list segmentation</a> comes into play. Not only does this help you relate to your audience better, but it gives your emails that personal feel that says “Hey, I’m listening and I know what you’d like to see.” Consumers prefer email quality over quantity anytime.</li> \n <li><strong>Make sure your email designs are responsive.</strong> Over 80% of email users access their inbox on their phones, and emails that don’t show up correctly on mobile devices are often <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics\">deleted in three seconds</a>. Ouch. Don’t let your email be one of those.</li> \n <li><strong>Don’t be afraid of the cold email.</strong> As uncomfortable as it is, the right email can convert new customers — like this <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/the-cold-email-template-that-won-16-new-b2b-customers\">cold sales email that won 16 new B2B customers</a>.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>👉🏼<strong>HubSpot Tip</strong>: You can’t send marketing emails without any recipients — these people make up your lists. There are plenty of <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/32028/25-Clever-Ways-to-Grow-Your-Email-Marketing-List.aspx\">easy ways to grow your email list</a>. Begin with opt-in forms on your website homepage, About page, and blog. Check out <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/forms\">HubSpot’s Free Form Builder tool</a> to get started.</p> \n<h3>B2B Digital Marketing</h3> \n<p>Every business, whether B2B or B2C should have a digital presence — which is comprised of paid ads, search engine optimization, a website, and any other place your B2B company is active online. Let’s walk through a handful of tactics that can strengthen your B2B digital marketing strategy.</p> \n<h5>Define your target audience</h5> \n<p>A strong B2B digital marketing strategy starts with defining your target audience, or <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/buyer-persona-research\">buyer persona</a>. This demographic and psychographic information will inform almost every other marketing activity thereafter, ensuring your content and digital material is absorbed by the right eyes and ears (and that no resources go to waste on your end).</p> \n<h5>Create your website</h5> \n<p>Secondly, digital marketing can’t quite function without an informative, engaging website. Over <a href=\"https://www.adweek.com/digital/81-shoppers-conduct-online-research-making-purchase-infographic/\">80% of buyers</a> visit a website before making a purchase. Moreover, since the typical B2B sales cycle often involves many key players (such as <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/identify-sales-prospects-influencers-decision-makers-ht\">gatekeepers, decision makers</a>, and other folks who have to buy into a purchase), websites are easy, straightforward ways for influencers to share information about your product or service.</p> \n<h5>Optimize your digital presence</h5> \n<p>Your website needs to be more than informative and engaging, though … it needs to be discoverable. You can do this with <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33655/a-step-by-step-guide-to-flawless-on-page-seo-free-template.aspx\">on-page SEO</a> and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/technical-seo\">technical SEO</a> tactics. These include everything from image alt-text and meta descriptions (what your visitors can see) to structured data and site speed (what your visitors can’t see). <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/6487/The-ABCs-of-Off-Page-SEO-Tactics.aspx\">Off-page SEO</a> is also at play here, which refers to external linking strategies and social sharing — SEO tactics that take place <em>off</em> your website.</p> \n<h5>Run PPC campaigns</h5> \n<p>Finally, round out your digital presence with <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ppc\">pay-per-click (PPC) advertising</a>, which allows you to get your content and brand in front of new audiences via search engines and other advertising platforms. I recommend maximizing your PPC investment by advertising more than your specific products or services — such as your brand personality, blog or social media content, or company tagline.</p> \n<p>The best way to see an ROI from your paid ads is by 1) incorporating your buyer persona data and 2) boosting content that they can relate to. For example, it’s highly unlikely a brand new consumer who’s never heard of you is searching for your exact product. They may be searching for a location-based solution or product feature. To reach the greatest number of potential customers, pay to target relevant categories within your brand vs. promoting your product or services.</p> \n<h3><a></a>B2B Content Marketing</h3> \n<p>We’ve talked about how B2B customers are focused on expertise, driven by logic, and desire to be educated. What better marketing tool to satisfy these priorities than B2B content marketing?</p> \n<p>Whereas a traditional PR marketing strategy interrupts a consumer’s day-to-day with promotional material, a content marketing strategy adds valuable information and informs the consumer — which is precisely what B2B customers are looking for. Not to mention that content marketing supports SEO efforts, which involves <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/google-search-statistics\">anticipating what your audience is searching for</a>, helping them discover your website and content … and potentially converting them to customers.</p> \n<p><em><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/b2b-vs-b2c-content-lessons?hubs_post-cta=pillar_allphrase\">Download our free guide and learn what topics convert at the highest rate with insight from 175,000 B2B &amp; B2C blog posts.</a><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/b2b-vs-b2c-content-lessons\"></a></em></p> \n<p>In fact, <a href=\"https://b2bprblog.marxcommunications.com/b2bpr/top-b2b-pr-mistakes-to-avoid?utm_content=10778068&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=Webbiquity.com\">80% of business decision makers</a> prefer to get information from an article than an ad. Knowing this, I’d say you should be putting the same (if not more) resources into your content marketing than your traditional advertising strategy.</p> \n<p>Because the B2B buyer’s journey is slightly different than the B2C buyer’s journey (which has shorter sales cycles and fewer decision makers involved), the content you create for your B2B content marketing strategy may vary more than the content you’ve seen as a consumer yourself, as illustrated in the below graphic.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/b2b-marketing-content-for-the-buyers-journey-graphic.png?width=600&amp;name=b2b-marketing-content-for-the-buyers-journey-graphic.png\" alt=\"b2b-marketing-content-for-the-buyers-journey-graphic\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<p>Before you start creating content, though, I recommend creating a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/47/engineering-blog-readership-7-ways-to-drive-prospects-to-your-small-business.aspx\">business blog</a>. (Don’t worry, <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/blog-readers\">growing your blog readership</a> is easier than you think.) Your blog will house all the content you create and serve as a home-base for readers to visit and subscribe to.</p> \n<h3>B2B Social Media Marketing</h3> \n<p>Did you know that <a href=\"https://www.idg.com/blog/5-statistics-will-change-view-b2b-buyers-journey/\">75% of B2B buyers and 84% of C-Suite executives</a> use social media when making a purchase? That’s right — social media marketing isn’t just for brands targeting individual consumers.</p> \n<p>Many B2B companies struggle with social media marketing, though. It can be harder to use social media to connect with business customers, especially because (as we mentioned above) there’s typically a lengthier sales cycle and longer chain of command.</p> \n<p>Honestly, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/32765/how-b2b-marketers-can-succeed-on-the-6-big-social-networks.aspx\">B2B social media marketing</a> might not be where you convert the greatest number of leads, and that’s OK. It likely comes into play near the beginning of your customers’ buyer’s journeys.</p> \n<p>Social media is a powerful tool for building brand awareness, giving your company an online personality, and humanizing your business — all very powerful factors when it comes to marketing and connecting with potential customers. Like email marketing, social media is also a highly effective channel for sharing your content and enhancing your brand expertise, the latter of which we know B2B customers appreciate.</p> \n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/social-inbox?hubs_post-cta=pillar_allphrase\">Overwhelmed by social media? Spend more time connecting with your followers with our time-saving suite of social tools.</a></em></p> \n<p>While your social media accounts might not convert as frequently as your content or email marketing, they’re just as important. In this case, followers are just as valuable — you never know when they might convert to leads or customers.</p> \n<p>👉🏼 <strong>HubSpot Tip</strong>: Why? Content shared by employee advocates <a href=\"https://www.socialmediatoday.com/content/employee-advocate-mobilize-your-team-share-your-brand-content\">receives over eight times more engagement</a> than content shared by brands. So, involve your employees in your B2B social media marketing strategy. Encourage them to create their own social media channels and share about life at your company. Create a culture account (<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/hubspotlife/\">like our @HubSpotLife Instagram</a>) to show what’s going on at work, not just what you’re selling. You never know — this might attract strong talent, too.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/b2b-marketing-social-media-employee-engagement-hubspot-life-instagram.png?width=600&amp;name=b2b-marketing-social-media-employee-engagement-hubspot-life-instagram.png\" alt=\"b2b-marketing-social-media-employee-engagement-hubspot-life-instagram\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<h2><a></a>B2B Marketing Examples</h2> \n<p>A B2B marketing approach that works for one business may not work for another, but that’s not to say we can’t learn something from the pros. Here are four <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/b2b-content-marketing-examples\">B2B marketing examples</a> of businesses who did it right.</p> \n<h3>Email Marketing: Mattermark, Raise the Bar Newsletter</h3> \n<p><a href=\"https://mattermark.com/category/raise-the-bar/\">Raise the Bar</a> is a daily digest newsletter from Mattermark that features insights from leaders in sales, marketing, and growth engineering. It’s hand-picked by Mattermark executives and easy to scan, which is valuable in a world of elaborate, complicated newsletters and daily digests.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/b2b-marketing-email-marketing-mattermark-raise-the-bar.png?width=600&amp;name=b2b-marketing-email-marketing-mattermark-raise-the-bar.png\" alt=\"b2b-marketing-email-marketing-mattermark-raise-the-bar\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<p>This is a good example of B2B email marketing because Mattermark takes the time to educate their subscribers without blatantly selling to them. This action builds trust with their audience while also equipping them with everything they need to know to make a purchase and become a paying customer.</p> \n<h3>Digital Marketing: Maersk, Website Homepage</h3> \n<p>It’s nearly impossible to know the intent of everyone who lands on your website, but <a href=\"https://www.maersk.com/\">Maersk’s homepage design</a> makes it easy for visitors to find their way around.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/b2b-marketing-digital-marketing-maersk-homepage.png?width=600&amp;name=b2b-marketing-digital-marketing-maersk-homepage.png\" alt=\"b2b-marketing-digital-marketing-maersk-homepage\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\"><a href=\"https://www.maersk.com/\">Source</a></span></em></img></p> \n<p>By offering three main options (“Become a Customer,” “Access Your Account,” and “Start a Career”), Maersk clearly segments their audience and allows visitors to easily navigate to the site content that corresponds with their intent.</p> \n<p>This small design tweak also helps Maersk build trust and authority within each of these niche audiences — potential customers, current customers, and even employees.</p> \n<h3>Content Marketing: LeadPages, Blog + Resources</h3> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/integrations/leadpages\">LeadPages</a> has been bootstrapped since its inception in 2012 … yet it hit over $16 million in revenue just three years later. Its owner attributes its rapid success to its content strategy, which makes it a great example of B2B content marketing.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/b2b-marketing-leadpages-blog-content-marketing.png?width=600&amp;name=b2b-marketing-leadpages-blog-content-marketing.png\" alt=\"b2b-marketing-leadpages-blog-content-marketing\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\"><a href=\"https://www.leadpages.net/blog/\">Source</a></span></em></img></p> \n<p>LeadPages produces many different types of content resources, such as a blog, customer stories, a podcast, and a webinar. The variety in these resources allows the company to reach customers where they are using the method that best resonates with them.</p> \n<p>LeadPages offers a blog that covers themes such as A/B testing, lead generation, and other topics that relate to the product and brand, a <a href=\"https://www.leadpages.net/podcast\">weekly podcast</a> that chats with everyday entrepreneurs, and even a <a href=\"https://www.leadpages.net/ultimate-guide-to-landing-pages\">definitive guide to landing pages</a>, which equips its customers to properly use and optimize the LeadPages product — all for free.</p> \n<h3>Social Media Marketing: MailChimp, Instagram</h3> \n<p>Social media is an effective channel on which to engage with your audience. It’s also a fun place to post gorgeous graphics and show off your brand personality. On <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/mailchimp/\">Instagram, MailChimp</a> has excelled at both.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/b2b-marketing-social-media-mailchimp-instagram.png?width=600&amp;name=b2b-marketing-social-media-mailchimp-instagram.png\" alt=\"b2b-marketing-social-media-mailchimp-instagram\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BxHfxo7FmP3/\"></a></img></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 13px;\"><em><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BxHfxo7FmP3/\">Source</a></em></p> \n<p>Fewer than half of its Instagram posts have to do with email marketing or the MailChimp product, but the MailChimp team always finds a way to make the posts relevant to its audience and followers — all while featuring fun, engaging, on-brand graphics and videos.</p> \n<p>MailChimp also uses its Instagram to feature real customer stories and testimonials, which can have a big impact on potential consumers in the <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-for-every-funnel-stage\">Consideration and Decision stages</a>. Finally, MailChimp makes use of a took called LinkinBio, which allows Instagram users to click-through to its homepage or other digital content (since Instagram doesn’t offer live links on its platform).

Was it an ad agency? A small or medium business? A B2B tech company? No matter who it was, if I’m impressed, I want to see more from the content creator.</p> \n<p>So once the video is done, I click the link to visit their profiles.</p> \n<p>And from there, if the brand is really on top of its game, I’ll see its channel art -- the horizontal banner displayed across the top of the user’s YouTube channel that, hopefully, shows a combination of good design and brand presence.</p> \n<p>But how do they do it?</p> \n<p>We’ve all seen design work that inspires us, but can have a bad habit of not taking it any further than that. What makes something like strong YouTube banners so great? And how can you create your own gorgeous artwork? To answer those questions, we found three excellent resources for YouTube banner templates, as well as seven creative channel banners -- both old and new -- that inspire us as marketers.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h2>What Makes a Good YouTube Banner?</h2> \n<h3>Responsive Dimensions</h3> \n<p>A YouTube channel banner will take on different dimensions depending on what platform is being used to view it. For example, a banner might have different dimensions when viewed on a TV, desktop, or mobile device.</p> \n<p><span><a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2972003?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&amp;hl=en\">Google</a>'s suggested YouTube banner dimensions are:&nbsp;</span></p> \n<ul> \n <li>Recommended: 2560 x 1440 px</li> \n <li>Minimum for upload: 2048 x 1152 px</li> \n <li>Minimum \"safe area\" where text and logos are ensured not to be cut off: 1546 x 423 px</li> \n <li>Maximum width: 2560 x 423 px</li> \n <li>File size: 4MB or smaller</li> \n</ul> \n<p><span>The recommended resolution&nbsp;</span><span>seems like an exorbitantly large file size. But think about how YouTube banners would appear on a 30\" smart TV or higher. With a growing number of options to view YouTube videos in this way, you'll want to make sure your channel art is large enough to display with quality on larger screens.</span></p> \n<p>Here's a helpful visual representation of those dimensions:</p> \n<img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/youtube%20banner%20dimensions.png?width=600&amp;name=youtube%20banner%20dimensions.png\" alt=\"Template showing the dimensions YouTube banners should adhere to\" width=\"600\" title=\"Template showing the dimensions YouTube banners should adhere to\" style=\"width: 600px;\">\n<span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Source: <a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2972003?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&amp;hl=en\">Google</a></span> \n<h3>Balanced Design</h3> \n<p>Take note of the \"safe area\" we alluded to in the first section. Your banner is essentially the biggest branding opportunity for when people land on your channel, so you'll want to make sure your logo and supporting text is well-represented in the channel art. That's why it might be best to place your company name and logo in that center space -- this prevents viewer confusion if the name of the company behind the YouTube account is accidentally cut off.</p> \n<p>If you're not sure how to take up the entirety of a 2560 x 1440 frame, video production company <a href=\"https://www.minimatters.com/youtube-channel-art-tips/\">MiniMatters</a> suggests \"build[ing] the image from the middle out,\" putting the most important assets in the center, and going from there.</p> \n<p>Finally, as to what to put in your banner, we like to follow a few basic rules:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Use a high-resolution image. A pixelated or blurry banner doesn't exactly signal that there's high-quality video to follow.</li> \n <li>Keep it on-brand. While your channel art doesn't have to be a carbon copy of your logo or tagline, it should incorporate visual elements that you want associated with your brand, like certain colors, fonts, or keywords.</li> \n <li>Your banner should represent what your company does in a timely fashion. For example, if you run a bakery and you're gearing up for summer, an eye-catching banner might be a high-res photo of a brightly-colored work surface covered with flour and a rolling pin, along with accompanying text like, \"April showers bring May flours.\"</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>How to Make a YouTube Banner</h3> \n<p>\"That's just great, Amanda,\" you might be thinking about these tips. \"But where the heck am I supposed to get these beautiful design assets?\"</p> \n<p>You're in luck -- there are dozens of free resources for creating a great YouTube banner. Here are a few of our favorites:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Google</strong>: Why not start with the hosting platform itself? <a href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/723CF6954B9CC9B50AD58BCC2F5F14825FF4\">Google</a> has its very own channel art templates to help you get started with your banner design. (Note: Clicking this link will prompt an automatic download of the zip file containing these templates.)</li> \n <li><strong>Canva</strong>: One of our go-to destinations for DIY design, <a href=\"https://www.canva.com/create/banners/youtube-banners/\">Canva</a> offers several free YouTube channel art templates that allow you to use your own art, or its library of stock photography.</li> \n <li><strong>Fotor</strong>: Similar to Canva, <a href=\"https://www.fotor.com/features/youtube.html\">Fotor</a> also offers a selection of free YouTube banner templates that allow you to use both your own visual assets or its own library of images.</li> \n</ul> \n<h2>8 Cool YouTube Channel Art Examples</h2> \n<h3>1. Death Wish Coffee Company</h3> \n<img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Death%20Wish%20Coffee%20Company.png?width=669&amp;name=Death%20Wish%20Coffee%20Company.png\" alt=\"Death Wish Coffee Company's YouTube banner\" width=\"669\" title=\"Death Wish Coffee Company's YouTube banner\" style=\"width: 669px;\"> \n<p>In 2016, Death Wish Coffee was named the winner of a small business marketing competition held by software company Intuit. The reward? A <i>free</i> 30-second commercial during Super Bowl 50. Since then, the self-proclaimed maker of “the world’s strongest coffee” has capitalized on that momentum by making sure its branding stays just as robust.</p> \n<p>Its former&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/DeathWishCoffeeCo\">YouTube banner</a>&nbsp;banner is no exception. It’s straightforward, but also, bold. The company’s logo is displayed as the channel icon, as well as a tiled watermark that doesn’t interfere with the text display. And that message doesn’t leave any doubt about what the brand does. “World’s strongest coffee?” Okay, I’m watching.</p> \n<h3>2. Adobe Creative Cloud</h3> \n<img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Adobe%20Creative%20Cloud.png?width=669&amp;name=Adobe%20Creative%20Cloud.png\" alt=\"Adobe Creative Cloud's YouTube banner\" width=\"669\" title=\"Adobe Creative Cloud's YouTube banner\" style=\"width: 669px;\"> \n<p>Seeing as turquoise is my all-time favorite color, there might be a touch of aesthetic bias in our selection of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/AdobeCreativeCloud\">Adobe Creative Cloud’s YouTube</a> banner. But color can have quite an impact in marketing -- shades of blue, for example, have been found to <a href=\"https://blog.kissmetrics.com/color-psychology/?wide=1\">invoke feelings of trust</a>.</p> \n<p>This banner doesn’t just make great use of color, though. In a single photo, it connotes creativity and visual quality -- two things that the Adobe Creative Cloud promises with its suite products. The person depicted seems to be creating something remarkable -- an ocean inside of a balloon -- with accompanying text to confirm it: “Make wow.” Plus, to learn more, social buttons are right there within the image.</p> \n<h3>3. Bon Appétit</h3> \n<img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Bon%20Appe%CC%81tit.png?width=669&amp;name=Bon%20Appe%CC%81tit.png\" alt=\"Bon Appétit's YouTube banner\" width=\"669\" title=\"Bon Appétit's YouTube banner\" style=\"width: 669px;\"> \n<p>Is anyone else hungry? It only seems right that the channel art for a food magazine like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/BonAppetitDotCom\"><i>Bon Appétit</i></a> should be, well, appetizing. And with a phrase that’s used as frequently as “bon appétit” -- before a meal or as the title of a pop song -- it’s important that folks who land on this YouTube channel know what they’re getting into.</p> \n<p>That’s one thing that makes this banner so great. The branding is clear, from the logo icon to the iconic title text in the center of the image. Plus, the photo itself sends a signal of the type of content visitors can expect to consume -- no pun intended -- when they start watching the channel’s videos: All things food.</p> \n<h3>4. TauliaInc</h3> \n<img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/TauliaInc.png?width=669&amp;name=TauliaInc.png\" alt=\"TauliaInc's YouTube banner\" width=\"669\" title=\"TauliaInc's YouTube banner\" style=\"width: 669px;\"> \n<p>One great thing about YouTube banners is that they can be swapped out or modified whenever you want, time permitting. That makes them especially conducive to temporary promotions or campaigns. That’s what tech company <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/TauliaInc\">Taulia</a> did for “P2P Superheroes”: a campaign that shows how its software can eliminate difficult, time-consuming tasks, helping everyday professionals focus more on the work that matters and turn them into superheroes.</p> \n<p>The banner communicates two things: 1. That Taulia is in the business of P2P (“procure to pay”), and 2. the brand really celebrates procurement specialists. And by using original, cartoon-like art, Taulia is turning what could be a dry topic into something fun and engaging.</p> \n<h3>5. Refinery29</h3> \n<img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/r29.png?width=669&amp;name=r29.png\" alt=\"Refinery29's YouTube banner\" width=\"669\" title=\"Refinery29's YouTube banner\" style=\"width: 669px;\"> \n<p>We’re big fans of showcasing the people that make your brand great. That’s one thing that <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/Refinery29TV\">Refinery29</a> does well, by frequently featuring its writers, editors, and content producers in its videos. As it turns out, they’ve all become quite popular personalities -- which is why the brand put them front-and-center in its channel art.</p> \n<p>Creating a banner of this nature is two-fold. First, you have to find a way to incorporate your company’s talent into video content in a way that’s engaging and appealing to your target audience. Here at HubSpot, we have our blog writers, for example, recount important information from blog posts in video and audio summaries. Then, once you’ve produced enough of that media consistently -- and if it’s gaining the right kind of attention -- you can use those personalities to promote your channels.</p> \n<h3>6. TripAdvisor B2B</h3> \n<img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/TripAdvisor%20B2B.png?width=669&amp;name=TripAdvisor%20B2B.png\" alt=\"TripAdvisor's YouTube banner\" width=\"669\" title=\"TripAdvisor's YouTube banner\" style=\"width: 669px;\"> \n<p>TripAdvisor is a resource used by millions of travelers to discover and rate lodgings, restaurants, and much more information about endless destinations. But did you know it also offers B2B services for hotel and other property owners to make the most of their presence on the site?</p> \n<p>We like to think of it as a B2B hybrid of review site Yelp and vacation rental site Airbnb. On the one hand, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCM3TDVOr39aSgx-yyJGz3WA\">TripAdvisor B2B</a> helps business owners create a profile with photos, descriptions, and other information that’s going to be helpful to travelers. But, like Yelp, it also allows them to monitor and respond to the reviews their businesses receive.</p> \n<p>That’s represented in the YouTube banner by portraying what the site is all about -- travel -- but also depicts the act of visitors giving feedback on their experiences by way of rating symbols.</p> \n<h3>7. Nuvolari Lenard</h3> \n<img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/nuvolari%20lenard-1.png?width=669&amp;name=nuvolari%20lenard-1.png\" alt=\"Nuvolari Lenard's YouTube banner\" width=\"669\" title=\"Nuvolari Lenard's YouTube banner\" style=\"width: 669px;\"> \n<p>The thing that stands out to us the most about this banner is its simplicity. It represents a Italian yacht design company <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/nuvolarilenard/feed\">Nuvolari Lenard</a>, which is known for work that emulates a luxury and chic lifestyle. And while the channel art itself doesn’t portray anything specifically nautical, the use of capital letters and tiered monochrome does connote a brand that’s high-end.</p> \n<p>Those kinds of digital aesthetics create what’s often known as aspirational marketing -- the kind that symbolizes something that’s unattainable by most, but still has a vast following of people “who covet the look and feel of the brand,” as <a href=\"http://mediaboom.com/news/5-luxury-brand-marketing-strategies/\">Mediaboom</a> puts it. Can I afford a yacht? Of course not. But seeing something like this makes me want one anyway, and makes me want to consume the video content pertaining to it.</p> \n<h2>Channel Your Creativity</h2> \n<p>It’s important to note that really cool YouTube channel art is just one part of a comprehensive video content strategy. It doesn’t matter how beautiful your banner is, for example, if your channel lacks in quality video, or hasn’t added anything new in several weeks.</p> \n<p>So, along with great design must come consistency. And as you begin to create both, you can turn to these examples for inspiration.</p> \n<p><i>What are some of your favorite YouTube banners?
