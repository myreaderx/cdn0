Both look like very fine gaming laptops indeed, but it's the super narrow bezels on all four sides of the Zephyrus M16's display that have really caught my eye here.

Gearbox Entertainment CEO Randy Pitchford shot down some rumors about the studio co-developing a new vault hunter game by saying \"Gearbox is lead dev of any future games in the Borderlands franchise\". He followed up to add that the <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/borderlands-3\">Borderlands 3</a> developers are \"working on the big one\". The next one is pretty much always \"the big one\" when it comes to game developers, but perhaps Gearbox are considering teasing their plans this summer.\n</p>\n <p><a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/borderlands-3-developers-are-working-on-the-big-one-gearbox-ceo-says\">Read more</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?a=VQy7b6oD0TU:aCyvTWE3YXE:nQ_hWtDbxek\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=nQ_hWtDbxek\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?a=VQy7b6oD0TU:aCyvTWE3YXE:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/RockPaperShotgun/~4/VQy7b6oD0TU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 07 May 2021 20:42:44 +0000","feedId":46,"bgimg":"https://assets2.rockpapershotgun.com/borderlands-art.jpg/BROK/resize/1920x1920%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/borderlands-art.jpg","linkMd5":"3875796834366437c3995b117030badb","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn95@2020_2/2021/05/11/18-29-40-515_4536c16703682a83.webp","destWidth":1080,"destHeight":608,"sourceBytes":214938,"destBytes":150394,"author":"Lauren Morton","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets2.rockpapershotgun.com/borderlands-art.jpg/BROK/resize/1920x1920%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/borderlands-art.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn95@2020_2/2021/05/11/18-29-40-515_4536c16703682a83.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=nQ_hWtDbxek":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn14@2020_4/2021/05/11/18-29-46-028_4c56023a3ecf3679.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn6@2020_6/2021/05/11/18-29-46-100_8be694f2d9c61abe.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/RockPaperShotgun/~4/VQy7b6oD0TU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn94@2020_1/2021/05/11/18-29-46-050_f0e149ae43a1b59b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1620757773286},{"createdTime":"2021-05-12 02:29:33","updatedTime":"2021-05-12 02:29:33","title":"Overgrowth developer felt he \"had no choice\" in filing antitrust suit against Valve","link":"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/overgrowth-developer-felt-he-had-no-choice-in-filing-antitrust-suit-against-valve","description":"<img src=\"https://assets2.rockpapershotgun.com/overgrowth-header.jpg/BROK/resize/1920x1920%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/overgrowth-header.jpg\" /> <p>Last month, Wolfire Games - developers of bunny kung-fu game Overgrowth - filed an antitrust suit against Valve.

There were a non-zero number of rooms with black mold. There were also no activities to engage in, and I couldn't carry my PC tower down there, so I just had my MacBook. My games that week mostly consisted of watching the overfed young blackbird I named The Idiot Child (who fledged but didn't want to leave and kept trying to get back into his nest; I assume he thought if he managed it his parents would just shrug and keep bringing him food forever). </p><p>Luckily, my laptop can also run <a href=\"http://www.somewhere.com\">Glass Masquerade 2: Illusions</a>. This is a jigsaw game inspired by stained glass windows, and I love it because those stained glass windows are from the most ridiculous church ever dreamed of. I played a billion hours of it last week.</p><p>I will preface this by saying that Glass Masquerade 2 is a genuinely good puzzle game. There are different difficulty levels, so you can have the game automatically show you where to place some edgy bits if you need help getting started. At the same time, the shapes you end up placing are very unlike standard jigsaw puzzle pieces, so it's a fun little challenge no matter what difficulty you choose.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-salute-the-artists-on-glass-masquerade-2-going-all-in-on-scary-meets-horny\">Read more</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?a=rNGGh-MHkis:Gw0Bi-0rfz0:nQ_hWtDbxek\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=nQ_hWtDbxek\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?a=rNGGh-MHkis:Gw0Bi-0rfz0:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/RockPaperShotgun/~4/rNGGh-MHkis\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Mon, 10 May 2021 14:11:19 +0000","feedId":46,"bgimg":"https://assets2.rockpapershotgun.com/glass-masquerade-illusions-2.jpeg/BROK/resize/1920x1920%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/glass-masquerade-illusions-2.jpeg","linkMd5":"684a59146b401880a469c7b827212b57","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn44@2020_3/2021/05/11/18-29-33-519_258e5607e993794a.webp","destWidth":1920,"destHeight":1200,"sourceBytes":303676,"destBytes":206952,"author":"Alice Bell","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets2.rockpapershotgun.com/glass-masquerade-illusions-2.jpeg/BROK/resize/1920x1920%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/glass-masquerade-illusions-2.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn44@2020_3/2021/05/11/18-29-33-519_258e5607e993794a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=nQ_hWtDbxek":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn14@2020_4/2021/05/11/18-29-46-028_4c56023a3ecf3679.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn6@2020_6/2021/05/11/18-29-46-100_8be694f2d9c61abe.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/RockPaperShotgun/~4/rNGGh-MHkis":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn83@2020_5/2021/05/11/18-29-46-031_3fbdfc2fc4381f1c.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1620757773284},{"createdTime":"2021-05-12 02:29:33","updatedTime":"2021-05-12 02:29:33","title":"What are we all playing this weekend?","link":"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/what-are-we-all-playing-this-weekend-143","description":"<img src=\"https://assets2.rockpapershotgun.com/soprano-lightly-frocked-1600.jpg/BROK/resize/1920x1920%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/soprano-lightly-frocked-1600.jpg\" /> <p>Apparently in the UK May is National Walking Month, neatly coinciding with me being in a tiny village with no wired internet, where the chief entertainment is \"going for a walk.\" Well, I refuse.

But thankfully, Riot are adding in a little feature called Flashguard that should at least let you see for a couple of seconds. </p>\n <p><a
