As Disney ramps up its 50th anniversary celebration for the Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, Florida, they <a href=\"https://www.marvel.com/articles/culture-lifestyle/guardians-of-the-galaxy-cosmic-rewind-opening-at-epcot-in-2022\">announced</a> today that the new E-Ticket roller-coaster attraction Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind has an opening ... year. Yes, it's not quite time to plan your trip to the opening day of the big new roller coaster, but we now know that Cosmic Rewind will open at Epcot in 2022.</p><p>It doesn't have quite the same punch as the <a href=\"https://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2021/09/first-voyages-on-star-wars-galactic-starcruiser-begin-march-1-2022-general-bookings-open-oct-28-2021/\">announcement</a> that Disney's \"Star Wars\"-themed Galactic Starcruiser hotel will open its doors on March 1, 2022, granted. But seeing as Cosmic Rewind is literally years in the making (having first been teased at the D23 Expo in July of 2017), it can't get here soon enough. Cosmic Rewind has been teased as the first \"other world\" pavilion at Epcot, and replaces the longtime favorite Universe of Energy attraction, which closed its doors for good in August of 2017 so that construction on this Marvel-themed ride could begin.</p><h2>An Otherworldly Ride</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/disneys-guardians-of-the-galaxy-cosmic-rewind-ride-will-open-in-2022/an-otherworldly-ride-1633039786.jpg\" /><p>The announcement of Cosmic Rewind's impending arrival was accompanied by some further details, shared by the Imagineers in the above photo, Tom Fitzgerald and Scot Drake. They shared details of the Wonders of Xandar pavilion, which is still underway in construction, <a href=\"https://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2021/09/just-announced-guardians-of-the-galaxy-cosmic-rewind-opening-in-2022-at-epcot/\">teasing</a> a few fascinating details about what we can expect from Cosmic Rewind. The ride is a 360-degree roller coaster, and the Disney Parks Blog post goes out of its way to emphasize that it's family-friendly, an interesting detail to reconcile with the tease that it begins with a reverse launch (a first for Disney) and is going to be one of the longest enclosed roller coasters in the world.</p><p>Now, if you recall Universe of Energy, or its '90s-era replacement \"Ellen's Energy Adventure\" (which co-starred a pre-talk-show Ellen DeGeneres, Bill Nye, the late Alex Trebek, and Michael Richards of \"Seinfeld\", among others), then you may know that the earlier attraction was housed in a massive building and clocked in at 40 minutes. Cosmic Rewind will no doubt be shorter, but it's easy to imagine the attraction being pretty long just considering how big the space is. How family-friendly will this ride be, though? That's the question, seeing as the Marvel movies inspiring the attraction lean heavy on thrills, as does the Guardians of the Galaxy: Mission - Breakout! ride in Disney California Adventure at the Disneyland Resort. Unlike the Galactic Starcruiser, we have to wait a bit longer to find out. But you know, Epcot's 40th anniversary is October 1 of next year. Maybe we should mark that down on the calendar for this ride too.</p><p>Read this next: <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/595359/every-mcu-post-credits-sequence-ranked-from-worst-to-best/\">Every MCU Post-Credits Sequence Ranked From Worst To Best</a></p><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/620959/disneys-guardians-of-the-galaxy-cosmic-rewind-ride-will-open-in-2022/\">Disney's Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind Ride Will Open in 2022</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=ZhIlSNi-Yqw:A3r1DEAoGFg:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=ZhIlSNi-Yqw:A3r1DEAoGFg:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=ZhIlSNi-Yqw:A3r1DEAoGFg:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=ZhIlSNi-Yqw:A3r1DEAoGFg:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=ZhIlSNi-Yqw:A3r1DEAoGFg:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=ZhIlSNi-Yqw:A3r1DEAoGFg:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/ZhIlSNi-Yqw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 30 Sep 2021 22:11:42 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/disneys-guardians-of-the-galaxy-cosmic-rewind-ride-will-open-in-2022/intro-1633039786.jpg","linkMd5":"01c6d0c028d03f3c9a3c37119ead8af2","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn97@2020_6/2021/10/01/02-08-02-882_abd6b89378212161.webp","destWidth":780,"destHeight":438,"sourceBytes":99043,"destBytes":46150,"author":"Josh Spiegel","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/disneys-guardians-of-the-galaxy-cosmic-rewind-ride-will-open-in-2022/intro-1633039786.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn97@2020_6/2021/10/01/02-08-02-882_abd6b89378212161.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/disneys-guardians-of-the-galaxy-cosmic-rewind-ride-will-open-in-2022/an-otherworldly-ride-1633039786.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn3@2020_2/2021/10/01/02-08-28-559_33af49c74f3bd385.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn91@2020_6/2021/10/01/02-08-28-889_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=ZhIlSNi-Yqw:A3r1DEAoGFg:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn68@2020_4/2021/10/01/02-08-28-504_f0b0e22ee273399d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn32@2020_5/2021/10/01/02-08-29-180_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=ZhIlSNi-Yqw:A3r1DEAoGFg:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn83@2020_4/2021/10/01/02-08-29-149_2a0bb12ca280c341.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/ZhIlSNi-Yqw":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn32@2020_2/2021/10/01/02-08-28-527_4565192d6a9e03d0.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1633054082370},{"createdTime":"2021-10-01 10:08:02","updatedTime":"2021-10-01 10:08:02","title":"Detective Nick Amaro Is Returning To Law & Order: SVU For The 500th Episode","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/621029/detective-nick-amaro-is-returning-to-law-order-svu-for-the-500th-episode/","description":"<img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/detective-nick-amaro-is-returning-to-law-order-svu-for-the-500th-episode/intro-1633045266.jpg\" /><p dir=\"ltr\">Thinking about \"Law & Order: SVU\" reaching 500 episodes has both immediately aged me into nothing more than a cloud of fine dust as well as justified the hours upon hours spent binging my favorite melodramatic and problematic crime procedural. The first spin-off of Dick Wolf's \"Law & Order\" immediately became a cultural phenomenon, likely due to the evocative nature of the crimes featured.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Now, for its historic 500th episode, the series is bringing back an all-time favorite character, Detective Nick Amaro of the Manhattan Special Victims Unit. Played by Danny Pino, Detective Amaro was a regular on the series during seasons 13-16 but moved to California to be closer to his kids, and knowing the NYPD would never promote him further due to his past behavior.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">After the news of his return broke, Pino <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheDannyPino/status/1442581769304297474?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet\">tweeted</a>, \"So...anything new #SVUDiehards?\"</p><h2>The Legacy Of Law & Order: SVU</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/detective-nick-amaro-is-returning-to-law-order-svu-for-the-500th-episode/the-legacy-of-law-order-svu-1633045266.jpg\" /><p dir=\"ltr\">Premiering in 1999, \"Law & Order: SVU\" is currently the fourth longest-running primetime scripted series in history, surpassing the number of episodes of the flagship show, \"Law & Order.\" Over the course of the series run, the show has received 91 award nominations, and star Mariska Hargitay was the first regular cast member on any \"Law & Order\" series to win an Emmy Award, winning the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series in 2006.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">\"Law & Order: SVU\" focuses on the Special Victims Unit of the fictionalized New York City Police Department. The show was headed by division Captain Olivia Benson (Mariska Hargitay) and Detective <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/573269/eliot-stabler-series/\">Eliot Stabler</a> (Christopher Meloni) until his departure in 2011. As the opening narration from Steven Zirnkilton explains, \"In the criminal justice system, sexually-based offenses are considered especially heinous. In New York City, the dedicated detectives who investigate these vicious felonies are members of an elite squad known as the Special Victims Unit. These are their stories.\"</p><p dir=\"ltr\">DUN! DUN!</p><h2>Who Is Nick Amaro?</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/detective-nick-amaro-is-returning-to-law-order-svu-for-the-500th-episode/who-is-nick-amaro-1633045266.jpg\" /><p dir=\"ltr\">After Meloni's departure as Eliot Stabler at the end of season 12, \"Law & Order: SVU\" had to make some huge changes. Detectives Nick Amaro and Amanda Rollins (Kelli Giddish) joined the team in place of Stabler. The big question surrounds his return to New York City as we last left him in California, as well as how he'll react to his former partner, Detective Rollins, who now has a relationship with Assistant District Attorney Sonny Carisi (Peter Scanavino), who was a detective the last time Amaro saw him.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"></p><iframe width=\"320\" height=\"320\" frameBorder=\"0\" src=\"//www.instagram.com/p/CUVol5zhnNY/embed\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe><p dir=\"ltr\">Amaro had to clean up a lot of the messes Stabler left behind, and with Chris Meloni back with his own show, \"Law & Order: Organized Crime,\" Meloni frequently appears on \"Law & Order: SVU\" for crossover events. There's a huge likelihood that the 500th episode will show Amaro and Stabler meeting face to face, and hopefully some juicy detective drama.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The 500th episode is the sixth in the current 23rd season and airs October 21, 2021, on NBC.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"></p><p>Read this next: <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/577991/rocky-movies-ranked/\">Butkus To Punchy: Ranking All 8 'Rocky' Movies From Worst To Best</a></p><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/621029/detective-nick-amaro-is-returning-to-law-order-svu-for-the-500th-episode/\">Detective Nick Amaro Is Returning To Law & Order: SVU For The 500th Episode</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=acpLZx8f0KA:3hjlg5L75S0:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=acpLZx8f0KA:3hjlg5L75S0:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=acpLZx8f0KA:3hjlg5L75S0:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=acpLZx8f0KA:3hjlg5L75S0:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=acpLZx8f0KA:3hjlg5L75S0:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=acpLZx8f0KA:3hjlg5L75S0:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/acpLZx8f0KA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 30 Sep 2021 23:47:16 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/detective-nick-amaro-is-returning-to-law-order-svu-for-the-500th-episode/intro-1633045266.jpg","linkMd5":"09bdc33a2577a3a9469f2ac0586cff79","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn96@2020_1/2021/10/01/02-08-02-758_152df69eb9bdbcf7.webp","destWidth":780,"destHeight":438,"sourceBytes":63753,"destBytes":14052,"author":"BJ Colangelo","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/detective-nick-amaro-is-returning-to-law-order-svu-for-the-500th-episode/intro-1633045266.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn96@2020_1/2021/10/01/02-08-02-758_152df69eb9bdbcf7.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/detective-nick-amaro-is-returning-to-law-order-svu-for-the-500th-episode/the-legacy-of-law-order-svu-1633045266.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn52@2020_5/2021/10/01/02-08-28-555_6a678b52cfbc8878.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/detective-nick-amaro-is-returning-to-law-order-svu-for-the-500th-episode/who-is-nick-amaro-1633045266.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn31@2020_4/2021/10/01/02-08-28-919_47252370525cf113.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn91@2020_6/2021/10/01/02-08-28-889_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=acpLZx8f0KA:3hjlg5L75S0:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn8@2020_5/2021/10/01/02-08-29-236_231fcd5fe25bf6bc.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn32@2020_5/2021/10/01/02-08-29-180_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=acpLZx8f0KA:3hjlg5L75S0:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn67@2020_2/2021/10/01/02-08-28-999_12a69dc1dc4fe8b2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/acpLZx8f0KA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn43@2020_4/2021/10/01/02-08-28-455_38df1dbc3c0b293a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1633054082370},{"createdTime":"2021-10-01 10:08:02","updatedTime":"2021-10-01 10:08:02","title":"The 10 Scariest Scenes From The Alien Franchise","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/621067/the-scariest-scenes-from-the-alien-franchise/","description":"<img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/the-10-scariest-scenes-from-the-alien-franchise/intro-1628529743.jpg\" /><p>Ridley Scott's \"Alien\" is a profound, seminal piece of science fiction and horror. In space, no one can truly hear you scream (per the first movie's official tagline), though just because it's unheard, it doesn't mean it's not there. With a profound scope, unmatched awe, gorgeous visuals, and bonafide body horror, the series is operatic, high-concept horror -- basically, a <a href=\"https://bloody-disgusting.com/movie/3411754/alien-perfect-haunted-house-movie/\">haunted house series set in space</a>. With talented directors at the helm, the Alien series offers visions of a horrific future that are as diverse as they are terrifying, which makes the wait for <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/more-alien-5-concept-art/\">any semblance of another mainline entry</a> all the more difficult.</p><p>Here, I review the 10 scariest scenes in the entire Alien franchise (including, yes, \"Prometheus\"). The scares extend far beyond the blackness of night into the infinite vastness of space, and while reducing a series known for gooey, Geiger-esque terror to just 10 scenes is difficult, the following sequences are simply the best in franchise with more scares than most. If you want to watch along, here is <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/alien-movies-streaming-or-for-rent/\">where you can find each of these movies online</a>. Just beware: <strong>spoilers</strong> follow.</p><h2>The Underwater Chase — Alien Resurrection</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/the-10-scariest-scenes-from-the-alien-franchise/10-the-underwater-chase-in-alien-resurrection-1628294009.jpg\" /><p>Jean-Pierre Jeunet's \"Alien Resurrection\" is arguably the weakest entry in the series, a grab bag of conventional shocks that's unfortunately tethered to the distinct (and dated) scare tactics of the late '90s. From its writer (none other than Joss Whedon himself) to its stars (Winona Ryder and Ron Perlman, in addition to franchise stalwart Sigourney Weaver), the entire enterprise feels immutably linked to the decade of its release.</p><p>Still, for all the hyper-masculine one-liners and arbitrary pick-up basketball games, \"Alien Resurrection\" still cultivates a genuinely tense atmosphere, with scares that shine brighter than the most magnificent supernovas. Chief among them is a mid-movie underwater chase sequence. As Ripley 8 (she's been cloned following her death in \"Alien 3\") and the remaining survivors of the Betty attempt to flee from the Xenomorph, they're forced to take a plunge into a flooded kitchen. One by one, they lower themselves into the water, take deep breaths, and swim. Soon enough, though, two alien pursuers arrive, moving through the water with fluid, almost dolphin-like, swiftness. It's an unconventional set-piece, and one the franchise should have made more use of. More aquatic aliens, please.</p><h2>The Backburster — Alien: Covenant</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/the-10-scariest-scenes-from-the-alien-franchise/9-the-backburster-in-alien-covenant-1628294009.jpg\" /><p>Ridley Scott's long-anticipated, ostensible <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2017/05/06/alien-covenant-review-prometheus-sequel-is-a-return-to-formula/?sh=57c7e5891ffa\">\"return to form\"</a> following his divisive \"Prometheus,\" the quasi-prequel that posed considerably more questions than the franchise needed, is a curious beast. \"Alien: Covenant,\" perched between the heady profundity of \"Prometheus\" and the sheer terror of Scott's original, proved just as divisive as its predecessor. Some praised the return of the iconic Xenomorph. Others lamented Scott's tenuous grasp on logic and consistency.</p><p>If nothing else (though there is a lot else, including a fabulous dual role for Michael Fassbender), \"Alien: Covenant\" is the closest the series has gone toward its horror roots since the first installment, especially a fervent, intense mid-movie setpiece. After responding to a mysterious radio signal containing a John Denver song, the Covenant crew lands on an ostensibly perfect planet. There, they track down the transmission's source and find a crashed alien ship. Meanwhile, Ledward (Benjamin Ridley) and Hallett (Nathaniel Dean) rush back to the pod after they're infected by an alien spore.</p><p>As Karine (Carmen Ejogo) endeavors to help, a neomorph (baby alien) bursts from Ledward's back. Maggie (Amy Seimetz) locks them both away, trapping Karine with Ledward's ooey-gooey corpse and a primal baby alien. The violence is off-the-charts and the tension palpable, augmented by a frenetic piece from Jed Kurzel's propulsive soundtrack. It's the best scene in \"Alien: Covenant,\" and is enough to make \"Covenant\" a trip worth taking.</p><h2>Facehuggers In The Medbay — Aliens</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/the-10-scariest-scenes-from-the-alien-franchise/8-aliens-has-facehuggers-in-the-medbay-1628294009.jpg\" /><p>Paul Reiser, you handsome, glorious trickster. Granted, he might as well have been wearing an \"I'm a Bad Guy\" sign for the entirety of James Cameron's action-oriented follow-up to \"Alien,\" but it's still a shocking and terrifying scene when, desperate to leave LV-426 with Xenomorph DNA, he traps both Ripley and Newt (Carrie Henn) in the med-bay with not one, but two facehuggers.</p><p>Facehuggers, of course, are an early developmental stage of the Xenomorph, a parasitoid creature that wraps itself around the face of its prey, shoves its reproductive organs down their throats, and implants a chestburster before promptly dying. The facehugger is terrifying on its own, tapping into primal fears about consent, pregnancy, and bodily autonomy -- it renders any victim a host for an alien creature -- yet the way Cameron frames the slowly-mounting tension makes this scene its best appearance in the long-running franchise. </p><p>It's a terrifying slow-burn, punctuated by two strong jolts, frenetic action, and last-minute escapes -- you can see its influence on Spielberg's own \"raptors in the kitchen\" sequence in \"Jurassic Park.\" \"Aliens\" is considerably heavier on action than Scott's original, but here, Cameron proves he's capable of delivering truly bone-chilling scares.</p><h2>The C-Section — Prometheus</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/the-10-scariest-scenes-from-the-alien-franchise/7-a-c-section-in-prometheus-1628294009.jpg\" /><p>The Alien franchise, at times, feels like it's all about topping the chestburster scene from the first (don't worry, we'll get to that later). As such, every entry at one point or another indulges in some gory body horror. \"Prometheus,\" Ridley Scott's long-awaited return to the series, is no different. Thematically and stylistically distinct from other Alien movies, \"Prometheus,\" written by Jon Spaihts and \"Watchmen\" and \"Lost\" scribe Damon Lindelof, is less horror and more heady sci-fi space opera, with the likes of Noomi Rapace, Charlize Theron, and Idris Elba navigating dense, otherworldly politics (without helmets).</p><p>Still, \"Prometheus\" is keen on horror when it counts most, and boy, does it count here.  As Rapace told <a href=\"https://www.independent.ie/entertainment/movies/rapace-prometheus-was-so-intense-26802770.html\">The Irish Independent</a>, \"I was out there filming for about six months and it was super-intense, my body was in so much pain sometimes but it was absolutely amazing.\" </p><p>The most intense scene occurs midway through. Shaw, after sex with her infected boyfriend, discovers she is in an advanced stage of pregnancy after a medical scan. Though infertile, Shaw rushes herself to a robotic surgery table, and in full, graphic detail, undergoes a cesarean section, during which a squid-like alien creature is removed from her chest. It's a gut-wrenching and painful scene, and Rapace sells the terror of accelerated space pregnancy well.</p><h2>LV-426 — Alien</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/the-10-scariest-scenes-from-the-alien-franchise/6-warning-or-distress-lv-426-in-alien-1628294009.jpg\" /><p>LV-426 would be further explored in James Cameron's follow-up, \"Aliens,\" but the original voyage to the planet remains one of the series' most haunting scenes. The crew of the commercial vessel, the Nostromo, is traveling to Earth. Mid-trip, they are awakened by Mother, the ship's computer, alerting them to a transmission from a nearby moon. Company policy mandates that distress signals be investigated, so the Nostromo lands. Dallas (Tom Skerritt), Kane (John Hurt), and Lambert (Veronica Cartwright) disembark on the strange, alien planet while the remaining crew-- including Weaver's Ripley -- remain on board.</p><p>The signal is coming from a derelict alien ship, and the ground crew enters, losing contact with the Nostromo just as Ripley deciphers the transmission -- it isn't a distress signal, it's a warning. The planet itself is stark, though rich in atmosphere, augmented by its scale and ambiguity. H.R. Giger designed the planet and the ship itself, working from <a href=\"https://alienseries.wordpress.com/2012/12/02/the-derelictpyramidsilo/\">Scott's brief note</a> that it look \"inhuman.\" The design is terrifying, modeled from plasticine and polystyrene over a metal frame, and remains one of the series' most iconic images. Three astronauts in awe of a Brobdingnag-esque, derelict spacecraft. It doesn't get more terrifying than that.</p><h2>A Familiar Friend Appears — Alien 3</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/the-10-scariest-scenes-from-the-alien-franchise/5-a-familiar-friend-in-alien-3-1628294009.jpg\" /><p>\"Alien 3\" is the black sheep of the \"Alien\" franchise. Part of that is linked to the movie's decision to unceremoniously kill off almost every survivor of \"Aliens,\" including Newt, before the movie even begins. The rest is linked to just how incongruous the movie feels both in the series and, frankly, within itself. \"Alien 3\" is like four different movies in one, with the machoism of Cameron's \"Aliens\" merging poorly with the more restrained tension of Scott's original. Director David Fincher has infamously disowned the movie. \"I'd always had this naïve idea that everybody wants to make movies as good as they can be, which is stupid,\" he told <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/feb/03/david-fincher-interview-transcript\">The Guardian</a> in 2009. \"I learned on ['Alien 3'] that nobody really knows, so therefore no one has to care, so it's always going to be your fault.\"</p><p>Still, in recent years, even the rough theatrical cut has been reconsidered, with <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/5/22/15660296/alien-3-david-fincher-defense\">Peter Suderman of Vox</a> remarking, \"Director David Fincher famously disowned his own entry in the Alien franchise -- but it's actually a showcase for his creative vision.\" That creative vision is in full swing when the Xenomorph on the prison planet ambushes Ellen Ripley and several others in the infirmary. The alien quickly dispatches the others and slowly crabs toward Ripley as she crawls away on the floor. It looks at her and moves in closer as she recoils. Then, it slowly backs away and leaves. It's a terrifying confrontation, rendered more poignant and frightening on account of Ripley's history with the creature.</p><h2>The Chestburster Scene — Alien</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/the-10-scariest-scenes-from-the-alien-franchise/4-a-friend-from-within-in-alien-1628294009.jpg\" /><p>Kane's death in the original \"Alien\" is arguably the most famous scene in the entire franchise. It's an enduringly popular, oft-emulated scare. Even series stars <a href=\"https://twitter.com/slashfilm/status/1422997405193187328\">were unaware of what was going to happen</a>, with the crew concealing how much animal blood and guts were going to be used to ensure an authentic reaction from the cast. Veronica Cartwright's <a href=\"https://www.empireonline.com/movies/features/alien-chestburster-scene/\">screams are genuine</a>. John Hurt's performance is visceral. Its legacy is undeniable. It's one of cinema's most terrifying, shocking sequences, known even among those who haven't seen the movie. It has terrified entire generations of moviegoers and will remain a perennial fixture of cinematic history.</p><p>Yet, for as profound as the scene is, its infamy has, in some capacity, reduced its ability to shock. It's a strange argument to make because the scene is perfect. The scare is infamous. Yet, as with the first of anything, the opportunity remains for it to be surpassed. While the chestburster is the most famous sequence in the entire franchise, in terms of pure, unadulterated terror, it isn't quite the scariest.</p><h2>A Stowaway — Alien</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/the-10-scariest-scenes-from-the-alien-franchise/3-a-stowaway-in-alien-1628294009.jpg\" /><p>In terms of haunting Gothicism, the concluding moments of \"Alien\" are more terrifying than the infamous chestburster scene, in part because of the chestburster itself. With the stakes and parameters set -- chiefly, nothing is off limits, so everything goes -- \"Alien\" ambles through its unpredictability masterfully.</p><p>Ellen Ripley has successfully detonated the Nostromo and escaped alongside the orange tabby cat, Jonesy. She is the sole survivor. She prepares for stasis while simultaneously making her last broadcast, an elegiac reflection on the preceding events. \"Final report of the commercial starship Nostromo, third officer reporting. The other members of the crew -- Kane, Lambert, Parker, Brett, Ash, and Captain Dallas -- are dead. Cargo and ship destroyed. I should reach the frontier in about six weeks. With a little luck, the network will pick me up. This is Ripley, last survivor of the Nostromo, signing off.\"</p><p>As Ripley prepares, director Ridley Scott unleashes one last scare. The Xenomorph, having camouflaged itself in the black, rubber tubing of the escape pod, awakens. Its hand moves, startling Ripley. It's enough to catapult audiences from their seats. Thoroughly tense, Ripley must then dress and prepare for one final battle as the Xenomorph, gloriously designed, unfurls itself and slowly makes its way toward her. The killer is never dead, and one of the most terrifying moments in \"Alien\" is a frightening confirmation of this trope.</p><h2>Monsters In The Vent — Alien</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/the-10-scariest-scenes-from-the-alien-franchise/2-monsters-in-the-vent-in-alien-1628294009.jpg\" /><p>Jump scares get a bad rap. To the undiscerning viewer, they lack artistry and intent. There is some truth to this argument. When deployed poorly, they're cheap, ephemeral scares, especially when used in lieu of genuine tension or atmosphere. When wielded effectively, though, they're an art form in and of itself. In recent years, supernatural horror maestro James Wan has <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/james-wan-malignant-frozen/\">perfected the colloquial jump scare</a>, though director Ridely Scott delivered a noteworthy jolt or two of his own.</p><p>With one person already dead, the remaining members of the crew take it upon themselves to track the alien down, trap it, and kill it. Tom Skeritt's Dallas enters the ducts while everyone else slowly locks the ship down to direct the Xenomorph's path toward Dallas, ready and armed with a flamethrower.</p><p>The Alien series' iconography extends beyond its visuals; the beeps of the motion tracker are an audial hallmark of the series. The tracker slowly rings out as the Xenomorph crawls closer to Dallas, who huddles in the cloistered ducts. Soon, it's right on top of him. A small torch on the tip of the flamethrower is Dallas' only light, and as he frantically looks around, he reports that the alien is nowhere to be seen. He descends a level and checks behind himself. Clear. When he turns around, though, the screeching hiss of the alien overwhelms -- it's right in front of him.</p><h2>A Monster In The Water — Aliens</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/the-10-scariest-scenes-from-the-alien-franchise/1-a-monster-in-the-water-in-aliens-1628294009.jpg\" /><p>The scariest scene in the Alien franchise is also, arguably, its simplest. \"Aliens\" director James Cameron had already flexed his horror chops when Ripley and Newt were ambushed in the med bay. The sly grandmaster of sci-fi terror, though, had one more trick up his sleeve. Newt falls down a grate as the survivors on LV-426 scramble to safety. She lands in a flooded corridor, clutching her doll to her chest. Luckily, Newt has a tracking device on, and Ripley and Hicks (Michael Biehn) use it to find her.</p><p>Newt slowly wades through the corridor, calling out for Ripley to come and rescue her. The silence contrasts with the frenetic, pulsating beeping and Ripley and Hicks' hollow footsteps. Finally, they reach the girl, though she's trapped below the metal floor. Hicks begins melting through the solder as sparks and embers drop below. Soon, though, the motion tracker beeps incessantly.</p><p>Suddenly, a Xenomorph emerges from the water, right behind Newt. She doesn't sense it at first, and the fluidity of the Xenomorph is gorgeous to behold as it twists right behind her, lit for maximum effect. Newt turns, and lets out a deathly scream. Ripley and Hicks break through the grate and find her doll floating aimlessly in the water. Newt is gone. It's terror in its purest form. After all, horror is always scarier when children are involved.</p><p>Read this next: <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/588264/movies-about-aliens-that-you-definitely-need-to-watch/\">20 Movies

Series","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/621048/things-to-know-about-kate-bishop-before-the-disney-hawkeye-series/","description":"<img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/12-things-to-know-about-kate-bishop-before-the-disney-hawkeye-series/intro-1633045032.jpg\" /><p dir=\"ltr\">With <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/578125/hailee-steinfeld-as-kate-bishop/\">Hailee Steinfeld</a> set to portray Marvel's world-famous female archer Kate Bishop on the new Disney+ \"Hawkeye\" series, it's time to brush up on our knowledge of the character.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Kate Bishop was only introduced to Marvel comics in the early '00s, but already has a complicated, Marvel-esque history replete with time travel, universe hopping, and tragic familial connections to villainy. While there's a lot to discuss when it comes to the junior Hawkeye, the most important elements (and those most likely to relate to the Disney+ series) come from her adventures in the first and second volumes of \"Young Avengers\" and the Matt Fraction and David Aja run of \"Hawkeye,\" which is the loose inspiration for the new show.</p><p>While Jeremy Renner's Clint Barton is often thought of as <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/602000/hawkeye-trailer-the-least-mighty-avenger-gets-his-own-disney-series/\">the least mighty Avenger</a>, his protégée Kate Bishop keeps him on his toes and frequently forces him to engage in exciting, if low stakes, heroics. How does this well-bred and well-moneyed young lady succeed in corralling an Avenger? Read on to learn the most important things you should know about Kate Bishop before \"Hawkeye\" premieres on November 24.</p><h2>Before She Was A Superhero, Kate Bishop Was A Debutante</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/12-things-to-know-about-kate-bishop-before-the-disney-hawkeye-series/before-she-was-a-superhero-kate-bishop-was-a-debutante-1633045032.jpg\" /><p dir=\"ltr\">Kate Bishop's father is a publishing magnate and a very wealthy man, which means that Kate hasn't wanted for much in her life, except for maybe a stable father figure who actually shows an interest in her.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">As Kate aged, she grew disillusioned with her father and took up her mother's influence, spending her time away from Hawthorne Academy in soup kitchens and women's shelters, critical of the way her family lavished money on themselves. Since then, Kate has found better ways to spend her family's wealth, including outfitting the Young Avengers with new uniforms and weapons and providing Clint Barton with access to exclusive villain-filled venues.</p><p>However, Kate has kept in touch with her high-class social circles and has Avenged a time or two in a designer dress. Most notably, she ripped apart an Emanuel Ungaro-designed garment to procure medicine and stop looters during an issue of \"Hawkeye\" devoted to the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy. Her experience in high society also comes in handy whenever heroes must tangle with the likes of Madame Masque, the mafia, or a troupe of high class circus performers. It seems likely Kate's experience with the social elite (and knowledge of designer fashion) will be helpful to Clint as they infiltrate <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/602433/hawkeye-trailer-breakdown-christmas-comes-with-a-bow-and-arrow/\">a Christmas party at Rockefeller Plaza</a> in the new series.</p><h2>She's Self-Assured, Stubborn, And (Almost) Always Right</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/12-things-to-know-about-kate-bishop-before-the-disney-hawkeye-series/shes-self-assured-stubborn-and-almost-always-right-1633045032.jpg\" /><p dir=\"ltr\">One of Kate's greatest qualities is her self-assurance. To many people that comes off as stubbornness or arrogance, but it's not really stubbornness or arrogance if you're only saying stuff because you're right. Kate cuts to the chase, saying exactly what she means and sparing few feelings. When the Scarlet Witch attempted to soften Kate's words after she referred to Victor Von Doom as a dictator (to his <em>face</em>), Kate hastily cut her off with, \"Kate said what she was trying to say.\" What a queen!</p><p>Kate's gentler with people she cares about, but only to the point at which their behavior negatively affects her. When Clint Barton started pushing away the people most willing to offer him help, she told him off and took a break from the man-child who wouldn't admit when he was in over his head. The decision to head out to L.A. on her own didn't land her in the best circumstances, as she ended up broke and trying to be a superhero for hire -- okay, maybe sometimes Kate's a <em>little</em> stubborn -- but she returned to New York when she uncovered a plot to kill Clint, sure she was the hero who could save him (and she was right).</p><h2>Disguises Are In Kate's Repertoire</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/12-things-to-know-about-kate-bishop-before-the-disney-hawkeye-series/disguises-are-in-katerepertoire-1633045032.jpg\" /><p dir=\"ltr\">Multiple times in Fraction and Aja's \"Hawkeye\" run, Kate dons disguises to infiltrate villainous lairs and rescue Clint from trouble. Presumably, a mix of being unassuming and just the right height and body type lets her get away with the ruse so many times.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">She knocked out circus performer Fifi, stealing her striped outfit and pink wig (conveniently barbed with arrows), and rescued Clint when he was captured and held at gunpoint.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Another time, Kate came to Clint's rescue in Madripoor when she infiltrated the Madripoor Pearl, a luxury hotel hosting an exclusive auction for the rich and evil. While Clint was busy sticking out, getting caught, and being used as a punching bag, Kate detained and replaced Madame Masque. She even swiped Clint's S.H.I.E.L.D.-issued Am-Ex Black card and attended the auction disgusied as the villain, securing a tape of Clint Barton assassinating an Asian dictator (never fear, the tape was a ruse to smoke out a S.H.I.E.L.D. mole). For this disguise, Kate at least had the benefit of a gold mask that covered her whole face, but it's still a good thing that all female superheroes and villains seem to have the same waist size.</p><h2>Madame Masque Is Her Arch Nemesis</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/12-things-to-know-about-kate-bishop-before-the-disney-hawkeye-series/9-madame-masque-is-her-arch-nemesis-1633045032.jpg\" /><p dir=\"ltr\">Every hero has a villain, and for Kate Bishop, her opposing antagonist is Madame Masque. They first butted heads in Madripoor, during the aforementioned auction and identity theft. What could be fueling Madame Masque's particular Kate-focused rage, however, is being hogtied in a bathroom while Kate used Masque's power and henchmen. That's sure to bruise any ego.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Following that embarrassing encounter, Madame Masque kept tabs on Kate, approaching her in Los Angeles with her face uncovered when Kate's financial strings were cut, her car was repo'd, and some bellmen made off with most of her possessions. In the guise of Whitney Frost, Masque offered Kate a place to stay, an offer Kate accepted with gratitude and exploding arrows. Masque retaliated by burning down Kate's next residence and killing an associate, pinning the murder on Kate. Oh, and Masque and her business associates took a hit out on the Hawkeyes. Needless to say, the feud is ongoing.</p><h2>Kate's Parents, Derek And Eleanor Bishop, Are Not The Kind Of Parents Superheroes Want</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/12-things-to-know-about-kate-bishop-before-the-disney-hawkeye-series/8-her-parents-derek-and-eleanor-bishop-are-not-the-kind-of-parents-superheroes-want-1633045032.jpg\" /><p dir=\"ltr\">Part of the reason why the feud between Kate and Madame Masque is ongoing is because Kate's parents are in cahoots with the villain! It's bad enough that Derek Bishop is an emotionally distant, self-serving, money-grubbing capitalist, but when Kate secretly spies him beating someone in his study, the walls of daddy adoration drop and disillusionment sets in. Kate still takes his calls and spends his money, and even makes nice with his new wife (who happens to be one of Kate's former classmates), but when she discovers that daddy dearest is in league with Madame Masque, who has spent an awful lot of time trying to torture and kill Kate, all bets are off.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Oh, and Derek was also part of the cabal who voted to kill the troublesome Hawkeyes for mucking up their real estate scheme. Dad of the Year, right there.</p><p>Of course, Kelly Thompson's 2017 \"Hawkeye\" solo series revealed that Eleanor Bishop is much less dead than previously advertised, and has been directing the activities of Madame Masque. Is no parental relationship sacred? Since the Disney+ series has cast <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/578147/hawkeye-cast/\">Vera Farmiga as Eleanor Bishop</a>, it's safe to assume this more recent connection to Madame Masque is the one the show will develop. It will be interesting to see how the MCU interprets Kate's complicit parents and their affiliations with the nefarious.</p><h2>Kate Bishop Is Trained As A World-Class Archer And Swordswoman</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/12-things-to-know-about-kate-bishop-before-the-disney-hawkeye-series/7-kate-bishop-is-trained-as-a-world-class-archer-and-swordswoman-1633045032.jpg\" /><p dir=\"ltr\">It takes a lot of skill to be Hawkeye, in addition to training, precision, and a certain level of devil-may-care regard for personal safety. But before Kate became a Young Avenger, she was kidnapped by El Matador and rescued by the Avengers, and then sexually assaulted in Central Park. The latter event left Kate feeling even more isolated and alone, and as a result she sought therapy, self-defense lessons, and combat training. Her mission? To make sure what happened to her never happened to anyone else. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">By the time the Young Avengers assembled in the ​​Allan Heinberg and Jim Cheung series, Kate was a skilled archer, fluent in fencing, and could wail on any bad guy with battle staves. She continued developing her skills in martial arts, boxing, and other hand-to-hand combat before officially falling in as Clint Barton's protégée. While Clint bested Kate in experience, through his tutelage -- and her good ol' fashioned determination -- Kate has grown to be as skilled and proficient as the original Hawkeye (and she actually organizes her trick arrows).</p><h2>She's A Founding Member Of The Young Avengers</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/12-things-to-know-about-kate-bishop-before-the-disney-hawkeye-series/6-shes-a-founding-member-of-the-young-avengers-1633045032.jpg\" /><p dir=\"ltr\">Kate met <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/578330/marvel-studios-young-avengers/\">the Young Avengers</a> during a hostage situation at Kate's sister's wedding. The team, then consisting of Iron Lad (Nathaniel Richards and the future Kang the Conqueror), Patriot (Eli Bradley), Hulking (Teddy Altman), and Asgardian (Billy Kaplan) destroyed a rose window, set a fire in St. Patrick's Cathedral, and almost became hostages themselves. Uh, they were not the most together superhero team at the start (or later, if we're being honest). But Kate's quick thinking and fast moves saved them, and together they took down the gunmen.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Kate later tracked the team to the recently demolished Avengers Mansion and insisted they let her join them. Reluctance gave way to need when Kate rescued them <em>again</em>, freeing them plus Cassie Lang (who would go on to become Stature) and joining them, Captain America, Iron Man, and Jessica Jones to take on Kang the Conqueror (yes, the future version of Iron Lad; yes, this story arc is full of time travel shenanigans). Before the ensuing battle, Kate outfitted herself with various parts of the Avengers' costumes, borrowing gear from Hawkeye, Mockingbird, and Swordsman (her codename was a little scattered at first).</p><p dir=\"ltr\">As the Young Avengers solidified, so did Kate's costume, weapons, and codename. She went on to co-lead the Young Avengers, splitting leadership duties with the equally stubborn Patriot. The \"Young Avengers\" run helmed by Kieron Gillen and Jamie McKelvie took the team into space and the multiverse, providing these young heroes with adventures as epic as the ones undertaken by their adult counterparts.</p><h2>Kate Bishop Is Not That Straight</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/12-things-to-know-about-kate-bishop-before-the-disney-hawkeye-series/kate-bishop-is-not-that-straight-1633047415.jpg\" /><p dir=\"ltr\">On the page, Kate has had romantic entanglements with several of her teammates, including Eli Bradley (introduced to the MCU <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/580066/falcon-and-the-winter-soldier-episode-2-review/\">in \"The Falcon and the Winter Soldier\"</a>) and Tommy Shepherd (Wanda's speedster son, last seen in the MCU dissolving into the \"WandaVision\" hex). During the 15-issue \"Young Avengers\" series by Gillen and McKelvie, Kate was romantically involved with Noh-Varr, a Kree super soldier from another universe. The series revolved partly around the teens' exes as super-foes, pitting the team against a phantom Patriot and three of Noh-Varr's ex-girlfriends.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Aside from those heterosexual romances, the Young Avengers is largely seen as the queer team, anchored by the central relationship between Billy Kaplan (Wiccan) and Teddy Altman (Hulkling). America Chavez (to be introduced to the MCU <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/578318/america-chavez-mcu/\">in \"Dr. Strange in the Multiverse of Madness\"</a>) is a lesbian, David Alleyne (Prodigy) comes out as bisexual in the series, and Loki explains that Asgardians don't really have the same understanding of sexual identity. When Noh-Varr admits he was on a Kree exploratory vessel and that \"exploratory\" has multiple meanings, Kate asks, \"Am I the only person on the team who's straight?\" To which America cheekily replies, \"Princess. I've seen the way you look at me. You're not that straight.\"</p><p dir=\"ltr\">While a romantic relationship between Kate and America still has not graced the pages of Marvel's comics, they are gals who are pals, appearing in each other's storylines and solo titles, continuing to give hope to those looking for role models that Kate Bishop will one day be confirmed to be queer.</p><h2>She's Got Hawkeye's Bow (And His Support)</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/12-things-to-know-about-kate-bishop-before-the-disney-hawkeye-series/4-shes-got-hawkeyes-bow-and-his-support-1633045032.jpg\" /><p dir=\"ltr\">When outfitting herself for her first Young Avengers mission, Kate swiped items from the Avengers' weapons cache, including Hawkeye's bow. Following that first mission (which included defeating Kang the Conqueror -- these teens were <em>not</em> playing around), Captain America and Iron Man decommissioned the Young Avengers, unwilling to encourage children to put themselves in harm's way.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">After it was obvious that the Young Avengers wouldn't stop assembling, and that helping them was a far better solution than continuing to treat super-powered heroes like they were normal teenagers, Steve Rogers returned the bow to Kate, since Clint Barton wasn't exactly using it at the time (Clint was dead, because comics).</p><p>After Clint Barton was resurrected (seriously, <em>comics</em>), he took up the mantle Ronin and tested the new Hawkeye, attacking her while she was on the worst date ever with Eli Bradley. Clint invited her to show off her skills at the Secret Avengers' base, where he revealed his identity. She put everything on a bet that he couldn't make \"the Robin Hood shot\" (splitting an arrow down the middle), but he did, so Kate had to give up the name <em>and</em> the bow. Luckily, Kate is stubborn as hell, so she broke into the secret headquarters to steal the bow back. That took guts and proved to Clint that Kate had exactly the right kind of fight in her to be a Young Avenger. He let her keep the bow and the name, and promised to have her back if she ever screwed up.</p><h2>Kate And Clint Barton Have Excellent Communication</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/12-things-to-know-about-kate-bishop-before-the-disney-hawkeye-series/3-kate-and-clint-have-excellent-communication-1633045032.jpg\" /><p dir=\"ltr\">Despite Kate getting so frustrated with Clint that she took a cross-country trip to clear her head, Kate and Clint have excellent communication. Sometimes Clint is a dummy when it comes to phrasing things and has difficulty expressing his feelings (Kate, too, actually), but they communicate when it counts and rarely have difficulty understanding each other, even without words (sometimes, they're much better without words).</p><p dir=\"ltr\">During the course of the Fraction and Aja \"Hawkeye\" run, Clint suffered hearing loss, forcing him to rely on hearing aids, sign language, and lip reading. From the Disney+ \"Hawkeye\" trailer, it looks as though the MCU's Clint may have similar problems after having the Avengers Compound explode around him in \"Avengers: Endgame.\" His ability to communicate with Kate in sign language may become an important element of the show, bringing increased diversity to the MCU and proving that you don't have to have a super-soldier serum fix your ailments before continuing as a hero.</p><h2>Her Dog Is Lucky The Pizza Dog</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/12-things-to-know-about-kate-bishop-before-the-disney-hawkeye-series/2-her-dog-is-lucky-the-pizza-dog-1633045032.jpg\" /><p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/602655/hawkeye-trailer-introduces-pizza-dog-the-most-important-character-in-the-mcu/\">Lucky the Pizza Dog</a> debuted in Fraction and Aja's \"Hawkeye\" run as the abused pup of Ivan, a member of the Tracksuit Mafia. He and Clint bonded over pizza, and later, Lucky attacked the Tracksuit Dracula shooting at Clint. Lucky was kicked into traffic for his heroism, and Clint did everything to save him. Lucky pulled through (with injuries fairly similar to what Clint was recovering from at the start of the issue), and Clint adopted him (Clint also changed his name from \"Arrow,\" which was too much kismet for certain archers).</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Lucky stayed in the background of most issues, popping up around Clint's apartment, often with a slice of pizza in his mouth. But Lucky continued to protect his people, leaping into the fray just like a Hawkeye. In an issue of \"Hawkeye\" told entirely from Lucky's point of view, he even tracked down the murderer of one of their neighbors and tried to do his own avenging. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">When Kate had enough of Clint Barton refusing to ask for help and pushing aside the most important people in his life, she took a break from their mentorship and headed out to Los Angeles. As she exited Clint's apartment, she wryly said, \"C'mon, Lucky,\" and Lucky followed her, because he had always been Kate's dog just as much as Clint's.</p><h2>A Shared Hawkeye Title Is Less Confusing Than It Sounds.</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/12-things-to-know-about-kate-bishop-before-the-disney-hawkeye-series/a-shared-hawkeye-title-is-less-confusing-than-it-sounds-1633047415.jpg\" /><p dir=\"ltr\">When Kate joined the Young Avengers, Clint Barton was kind of dead at the time, meaning the mantle \"Hawkeye\" was available. After giving Steve Rogers a dressing down for not agreeing to train the Young Avengers, Steve gifted Kate Clint's bow and arrows and bequeathed the codename to her. Despite her reservations, who's going to say no to Captain America?</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Since superheroes rarely stay dead, Clint Barton was revived following the \"House of M\" storyline by means that are truly too complicated to cover here. At the time of the Fraction and Aja \"Hawkeye\" run, which lasted from 2012 through 2015, Kate and Clint were sharing the codename. This caused some confusion, but not as much as you might think. In a genius moment of disambiguation, Grills, one of the tenants in Clint's building, mispronounces Clint's codename as \"Hawkguy,\" differentiating the two Hawkeyes no matter how much Clint really, really wishes it didn't. Kate seems fine with the verbal distinction.</p><p>Read this next: <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/595359/every-mcu-post-credits-sequence-ranked-from-worst-to-best/\">Every MCU Post-Credits

src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/ted-lasso-star-hannah-waddingham-heading-to-tom-jones-remake-for-masterpiece/intro-1633052283.jpg\" /><p>In what feels like a deeply British series of events, \"<a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/581830/ted-lasso-season-2-trailer-full/\">Ted Lasso</a>\" actress Hannah Waddingham has officially joined the cast of \"Tom Jones.\" That's right, your favorite fictional feisty football owner has set her eyes on the miniseries based on the classic British novel, which has nothing to do with the Welsh singer Tom Jones, even if the title does trigger \"It's Not Unusual\" to start blaring in your head. </p><p>It's best to get all the Tom Jones straightened out in your head now, otherwise, the singer's hits will be stuck in your head for the entirety of this story, and it will be no one's fault but your own.</p><p>The series, which is being produced by ITV, Mammoth Screen, and good old Masterpiece (the PBS variety), is based on the 1749 novel \"The History of Tom Jones, A Foundling\" by Henry Fielding. The original story follows the aforementioned Tom Jones, who is raised away from his parents by a wealthy family on a country estate and grows up to be an extroverted man who is looking for love in all the wrong places. The main cast includes Solly McLeod (\"The Rising\") as Tom Jones, Sophie Wilde (\"Eden\") as his love interest Sophia Western, Pearl Mackie (\"<a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/550148/doctor-who-gay-companion/\">Doctor Who</a>\") as Sophie's maid, Honour, and our girl Waddingham as Lady Bellaston, a high-society woman who wants Tom all for herself. </p><h2>What's New Pussycat?</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/ted-lasso-star-hannah-waddingham-heading-to-tom-jones-remake-for-masterpiece/whats-new-pussycat-1633051789.jpg\" /><p>In a press release for <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/masterpiece/specialfeatures/masterpiece-announces-new-adaptation-of-tom-jones/\">PBS</a>, writer and executive producer of the series Gwyneth Hughes describes the series best, saying, \"'Tom Jones' is the mother of all romcoms and isn't that just what we all need after the last couple of years of misery? It's a story where the sun barely stops shining, where love conquers all, and at its warm heart stand a pair of young sweethearts everyone can root for.\"</p><p>Although the story isn't all sunshine and rainbows, the novel was considered quite scandalous at the time due to its promiscuous plot lines and sexual scenarios. While the 1963 film (also named \"Tom Jones\") definitely maintained the novel's racy tone (just look at <a href=\"https://www.alamy.com/tom-jones-1963-mgm-poster-file-reference-31386-610tha-image218990295.html?pv=1&stamp=2&imageid=4745BE41-2071-4568-BFC9-9F97AA7FE9BE&p=729462&n=0&orientation=0&pn=1&searchtype=0&IsFromSearch=1&srch=foo%3dbar%26st%3d0%26pn%3d1%26ps%3d100%26sortby%3d2%26resultview%3dsortbyPopular%26npgs%3d0%26qt%3dtom%2520jones%25201963%2520poster%26qt_raw%3dtom%2520jones%25201963%2520poster%26lic%3d3%26mr%3d0%26pr%3d0%26ot%3d0%26creative%3d%26ag%3d0%26hc%3d0%26pc%3d%26blackwhite%3d%26cutout%3d%26tbar%3d1%26et%3d0x000000000000000000000%26vp%3d0%26loc%3d0%26imgt%3d0%26dtfr%3d%26dtto%3d%26size%3d0xFF%26archive%3d1%26groupid%3d%26pseudoid%3d%26a%3d%26cdid%3d%26cdsrt%3d%26name%3d%26qn%3d%26apalib%3d%26apalic%3d%26lightbox%3d%26gname%3d%26gtype%3d%26xstx%3d0%26simid%3d%26saveQry%3d%26editorial%3d1%26nu%3d%26t%3d%26edoptin%3d%26customgeoip%3d%26cap%3d1%26cbstore%3d1%26vd%3d0%26lb%3d%26fi%3d2%26edrf%3d%26ispremium%3d1%26flip%3d0%26pl%3d\">this vintage poster</a>), it looks like the miniseries won't be anything to scoff at either. As Hughes explains:</p><blockquote>\"Henry Fielding's 18th century novel is sexy and fun; it's also a dramatic rollercoaster, addressing so many modern concerns around consent, sexual equality and the pursuit of happiness.

Tom Hardy reprises his role as Brock, and Woody Harrelson is back with different hair as Kasady after appearing in a mid-credits scene in the first \"Venom\" movie. Serkis, who portrayed Ulysses Klaue in \"Black Panther\" and is the greatest mo-cap actor who ever lived, has taken over the directorial reins from Ruben Fleischer.</p><p>That's not the only piece of comic-book-related Serkis news, however. According to <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/andy-serkis-eternus-comic-1235022855/\">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, Serkis is set to co-create a new series for Scout Comics, with financing from Thunder Comics, a new label founded earlier this year, \"which seeks to team up talent from film and TV with comic book creators.\"</p><p>Serkis will be teaming up with screenwriter and director Andrew Levitas for \"Eternus,\" a seven-issue series inspired by Greek myth. The series is said to take place in 360 AD, \"30 years after the murder of Zeus in his own temples.\" Zeus' son, Heracles, better known by his Roman name, Hercules, \"is now a depressed drunk, while the old gods struggle to stay alive after decades of Christian disruption.\"</p><h2>The Eternus Creative Team</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/andy-serkis-is-making-a-comic-inspired-by-greek-mythology/the-eternus-creative-team-1633048330.jpg\" /><p>Heracles/Hercules has been the subject of countless films, everything from <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/568984/hercules-revisited/\">Disney animated features</a> to live-action Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson movies. Now, you'll be able to read his comic book adventures, with a story co-conceived by Serkis.</p><p>Though THR credits Serkis and Levitas as the co-creators of \"Eternus,\" it also notes that Don Handfield and Anastajza K Davis are writing the series.

While he frequently works with established franchises and adapts previously existing properties, Vaughn makes his stories feel original, and his confidence behind the camera has made him one of the most prominent voices of his generation.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Vaughn is brilliant in the way he approaches familiar genres. Espionage thrillers, romantic fairy tales, superhero origin stories, and underground mafia sagas are by no means new, but Vaughn knows his cinematic history and subverts expectations by tackling these stories from a less familiar perspective. A more traditional approach may have made these films feel stale and unoriginal, but with Vaughn at the helm they come across as fresh.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Vaughn has carved out an exciting future for himself. His \"Kingsman\" prequel, <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/586492/the-kings-man-red-band-trailer-the-super-spy-prequel-gets-bloody/\">the \"The King's Man,\"</a> hits theaters in December 2021 after a series of COVID-19-related pushbacks. After that, Vaughn will return to the world of spies and assassins <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/583148/apple-picks-up-matthew-vaughns-spy-movie-argylle-in-massive-200-million-deal/\">with \"Argylle,\"</a> a conspiracy thriller starring Bryce Dallas Howard, Sam Rockwell, Henry Cavill, and Samuel L. Jackson. Until then, here are all six Matthew Vaughn movies, ranked worst to best.</p><h2>Kingsman: The Golden Circle</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/ranking-all-of-matthew-vaughns-films-worst-to-best/kingsman-the-golden-circle-1633043079.jpg\" /><p dir=\"ltr\">Vaughn's \"Kingsman\" sequel is his weakest film by a wide margin. It's hard to doubt his ambition in crafting a follow up that outdoes the shocking extremes of the first film, but in aiming big, Vaughn lost the charm that made the original film unique. The first \"Kingsman\" had engaging characters and playful nods towards the history of spy films. However, \"The Golden Circle\" is so plot heavy that it often feels like Vaughn is trying too hard to cram all of his ideas into a single, convoluted story.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The main issue with \"The Golden Circle\" is that it doesn't justify the return of Colin Firth's Harry Hart. Hart's death in the first film was a real moment of darkness that showed that, despite the self-aware tone, the films are not spoofs. Not only is his survival in \"The Golden Circle\" implausible, but it destroys Eggsy's (Taron Egerton) character development. Eggsy had begun to grow and develop as a hero of his own, and no longer needed a mentor character. The time dedicated to explaining Hart's return also hampers the film's momentum.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Julianne Moore is underwhelming as villain Poppy Adams, a cartel overlord who launches a plot to kill all drug users. Moore's performance is too campy, even for the film's exaggerated style. The attempts at social satire, with a conspiracy involving the President of the United States (Bruce Greenwood), also fall flat.</p><h2>Kingsman: The Secret Service</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/ranking-all-of-matthew-vaughns-films-worst-to-best/kingsman-the-secret-service-1633043079.jpg\" /><p dir=\"ltr\">When it debuted, \"Kingsman: The Secret Service\" was a breath of fresh air. The James Bond and Jason Bourne films had become grittier than ever, making \"The Secret Service\" a throwback to the classic days of spy cinema with fun gadgets, outrageous locations, and eccentric villains. \"The Secret Service\" stays modern and has a surprising aptitude for dark humor and outrageous deaths, as evidenced in a frantic sequence in which Colin Firth takes out an entire church of fanatic extremists. The bloodbath should make even the most hardened viewer laugh and cringe in equal manner.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Taron Egerton is an extremely likable protagonist. Eggsy's backstory is compelling, as he's wrestling with living up to the expectations of a father he never knew. Growing up poor and struggling to stay out of trouble, Eggsy fulfills his potential by following in his father's footsteps and joining England's elite squad of gentlemen spies. Firth's character doesn't only teach Eggsy the tenets of the Kingsman's code, but how to be a man of honor as well.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">\"The Secret Service\" does drag during Eggsy's training, and the storyline about Firth investigating the sadistic billionaire Richmond Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson) is more interesting. The references to Roger Moore-era Bond films also grow irritating; it's nice that Vaughn knows his history, but callbacks are unnecessary when the film is creating an identity of its own.</p><h2>Layer Cake</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/ranking-all-of-matthew-vaughns-films-worst-to-best/layer-cake-1633043079.jpg\" /><p dir=\"ltr\">Prior to becoming a director, Vaughn worked as a producer for fellow British filmmaker Guy Ritchie, who codified the London crime thriller with films like \"Snatch\" and \"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.\" With his directorial debut, Vaughn took on a similar story to the ones told by his longtime friend, but \"Layer Cake\" is far from a Ritchie duplicate. While Ritchie's films are darkly comic and relentlessly paced, Vaughn opts for a slick and tragic tale about a man who is unable to escape the consequences of his criminal lifestyle.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">\"Layer Cake\" is the film that announced Daniel Craig as a major talent, and his role as the ruthless cocaine shipper known as \"XXXX\" is largely seen as the performance that helped him become James Bond. XXXX knows how dangerous the drug wars are getting, and he looks for an early retirement. After deciding to become a legitimate businessman, XXXX reenters into the game when his longtime ally Jimmy Price (Kenneth Cranham) asks him to oversee one last job. Craig brilliantly shows XXXX's conflicted feelings; he knows how to run a tight operation, but he's hesitant to engage out of fear of being drawn back in.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The various gangs and political players involved in the heists could be confusing, but Vaughn clearly explains each group's involvement in the story, giving them a purpose. Even minor characters, such as Tom Hardy's Clarkie, are memorable.</p><h2>Kick-Ass</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/ranking-all-of-matthew-vaughns-films-worst-to-best/kick-ass-1633043079.jpg\" /><p dir=\"ltr\">\"Kick-Ass\" came out right when superhero movies were beginning to dominate the film industry. The genre was in desperate need of a shake up, and \"Kick-Ass\" explored the filthy reality of what being a caped crusader would actually be like. The prospect of saving lives and fighting cruel villains seems fun in the pages of a comic book, but as a daily profession, it would make it impossible to live a normal life. \"Kick-Ass\" also satirizes the notion of hero worship; the titular crime fighter possesses no powers, has no reason to become a hero, and is far from charismatic.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The story's masterstroke is making the characters comic book fans, and the film references the history of superheroes through conversations that feel realistic. Aaron Taylor-Johnson is effective as the geeky Dave Lizewski, who begins fighting crime because he feels unsatisfied. Taylor-Johnson makes Lizewski initially pathetic, but shows his growth as he learns to accept the responsibility that he once thought he could reject.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">However, the real scene stealers are the veteran superhero Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage) and his young daughter, Hit-Girl (Chloe Grace Moretz), who was trained by her father from an early age. Vaughn utilizes Cage's unconventional sense of humor, but Big Daddy also gives important lessons to Lizewski about fighting evil no matter the personal cost. Moretz is a burst of energy, and seeing a child ruthlessly dispatch mobsters is hilariously awesome. Mark Strong is also fun as the main villain, Frank D'Amico.</p><h2>Stardust</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/ranking-all-of-matthew-vaughns-films-worst-to-best/stardust-1633043079.jpg\" /><p dir=\"ltr\">It's a real shame that \"Stardust\" underperformed financially, because the sweeping romantic adventure deserved to be \"The Princess Bride\" for a new generation. Compared to the sadistic nature of Vaughn's R-rated films, \"Stardust\" is charmingly sincere. The characters are quirky and the story lampoons familiar fantasy tropes, yet the emotional moments are still heartfelt. It showed a sweet, sensitive side to Vaughn and proved how versatile of a filmmaker he is.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The lovesick peasant Tristan Thorn (Charlie Cox) yearns for the love of the maiden Victoria (Sienna Miller). He embarks upon an epic quest, traveling across the magical fantasy kingdom of Stormhold in order to retrieve a fallen star with a humanoid form named Yvaine (Claire Danes). Not only is Tristan hopelessly naïve and limited in his abilities as a swordsman, but he's never traveled outside of the stone borders of his hometown. Cox brings the hero's journey to life as Tristan grows beyond his comic incompetence.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The heart of \"Stardust\" is the growing bond between Tristan and Yvaine. The pair bonds as they escape the vengeful Prince Septimus (Mark Strong), who wants a magic stone that Yvaine holds in order to take the throne of Stormhold. Gradually, Tristan realizes that, although he began the mission looking for Victoria's love, it's Yvaine's that he has earned. Strong chews the scenery as an insecure ruler, and Michelle Pfeiffer is having a blast as an ancient witch that Septimus unleashes.</p><h2>X-Men: First Class</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/ranking-all-of-matthew-vaughns-films-worst-to-best/x-men-first-class-1633043079.jpg\" /><p dir=\"ltr\">Before Vaughn's involvement, the X-Men franchise was in shambles. \"X-Men: The Last Stand\" ruined the setup of the first two films, and the disastrous \"X-Men Origins: Wolverine\" failed to tell a compelling origin story. Fans were skeptical that another prequel would work, especially considering how iconic the performances by Patrick Stewart as Professor X and Ian McKellen as Magneto already were. However, Vaughn's brilliant \"First Class\" told a fascinating story about two friends who bonded over their differences, only to be torn apart by how they chose to confront intolerance.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The young Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and Erik Lehnsherr (Michael Fassbender) come from opposite backgrounds. Xavier is born into privilege, living in an expensive mansion and granted the resources to research mutant development. Lehnsherr is raised with tragedy, and witnesses the violent slaughter of his family during the film's gripping Holocaust sequence. Xavier seeks to make amends with mankind while Lehnsherr chooses a path of vengeance, and Vaughn understands how privilege impacts both characters' perspectives. The younger versions of Beast (Nicolas Hoult) and Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) also flesh out characters not given enough depth in the original X-Men trilogy.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The recreation of the '60s is spot on, with fun period details recalling Vaughn's love of early James Bond movies. The incorporation of mutants in the Cuban Missile Crisis is an interesting way of tying the story to real history, and creates an exciting climax in which the mutants are divided by their loyalties to Professor X and Magneto.</p><p>Read this next: <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/594573/every-pre-mcu-marvel-movie-ranked/\">Every Pre-MCU Marvel Movie Ranked</a></p><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/621009/all-of-matthew-vaughns-films-ranked-worst-to-best/\">All of Matthew Vaughn's Films Ranked Worst To Best</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=cHhNTc_P1fM:74-OwQP3Bxs:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=cHhNTc_P1fM:74-OwQP3Bxs:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=cHhNTc_P1fM:74-OwQP3Bxs:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=cHhNTc_P1fM:74-OwQP3Bxs:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=cHhNTc_P1fM:74-OwQP3Bxs:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=cHhNTc_P1fM:74-OwQP3Bxs:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/cHhNTc_P1fM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 30 Sep 2021 23:11:42 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/ranking-all-of-matthew-vaughns-films-worst-to-best/intro-1633043458.jpg","linkMd5":"fed62f70817dbd792de5390f45415d1d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn26@2020_3/2021/10/01/02-08-12-930_91a168a35ae694a9.webp","destWidth":780,"destHeight":438,"sourceBytes":79597,"destBytes":28514,"author":"Liam Gaughan","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/ranking-all-of-matthew-vaughns-films-worst-to-best/intro-1633043458.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn26@2020_3/2021/10/01/02-08-12-930_91a168a35ae694a9.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/ranking-all-of-matthew-vaughns-films-worst-to-best/kingsman-the-golden-circle-1633043079.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn36@2020_1/2021/10/01/02-08-28-521_5c802ea02f12a96c.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/ranking-all-of-matthew-vaughns-films-worst-to-best/kingsman-the-secret-service-1633043079.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn47@2020_6/2021/10/01/02-08-29-065_2a2341092d68fbae.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/ranking-all-of-matthew-vaughns-films-worst-to-best/layer-cake-1633043079.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn64@2020_3/2021/10/01/02-08-28-551_78742f9cfbd89347.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/ranking-all-of-matthew-vaughns-films-worst-to-best/kick-ass-1633043079.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn51@2020_3/2021/10/01/02-08-28-778_2dfa1fe189f44f1c.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/ranking-all-of-matthew-vaughns-films-worst-to-best/stardust-1633043079.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn39@2020_6/2021/10/01/02-08-29-151_13b24f71df3da1a5.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/ranking-all-of-matthew-vaughns-films-worst-to-best/x-men-first-class-1633043079.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn99@2020_3/2021/10/01/02-08-28-495_56e10d592968c55d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn91@2020_6/2021/10/01/02-08-28-889_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=cHhNTc_P1fM:74-OwQP3Bxs:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn56@2020_5/2021/10/01/02-08-28-463_143ba134dfb64715.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn32@2020_5/2021/10/01/02-08-29-180_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=cHhNTc_P1fM:74-OwQP3Bxs:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn71@2020_2/2021/10/01/02-08-28-562_14da1e8a414649f7.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/cHhNTc_P1fM":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn47@2020_1/2021/10/01/02-08-28-537_ac55c8574162026a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1633054082370},{"createdTime":"2021-10-01 10:08:02","updatedTime":"2021-10-01 10:08:02","title":"Batman Movies Ranked From Worst To Best","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/621081/batman-movies-ranked-from-worst-to-best/","description":"<img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/batman-movies-ranked-from-worst-to-best/intro-1633050363.jpg\" /><p>Batman is one of the oldest superheroes depicted in the media, having first appeared in the pages of \"Detective Comics\" in 1939. Along with Superman and Wonder Woman, he's considered part of DC Comics' \"Holy Trinity\"; really, there's no bigger superhero in pop culture. While the character started out as a comic book character, he's made his way into live-action a number of times. Two low-budget serials screened in the '40s, while ABC's campy \"Batman\" series followed in 1966. The show ran for only three seasons, but was widely popular on its debut, and developed a cult following thanks to standout performances like Cesar Romero as the Joker and Yvonne Craig as Batgirl. </p><p>Batman quickly became a Saturday morning cartoon staple, but outside of the comics, he's still best known as a movie star. Adam West played the Caped Crusader in the first live-action \"Batman\" film, and a revolving door of actors have played Bruce Wayne and his alter-ego since, each with varying degrees of success. \"Twilight\" actor Robert Pattinson <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/matt-reeves-the-batman-filming-wraps/\">wrapped filming on \"The Batman\"</a> in spring 2021. His take will <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-batman-release-date-and-more/\">swing into theaters on March 4, 2022</a>.</p><p>Before then, though, it's important to remember how far this character has come, so here is a ranking of all the Batman movies that have been released. Just keep in mind that list only includes live-action movies that feature Batman as the main character, so films like \"Joker,\" \"Justice League,\" and \"Batman: Mask of the Phantasm\" will not be ranked. </p><h2>Batman Forever</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/batman-movies-ranked-from-worst-to-best/9-batman-forever-1628545065.jpg\" /><p>If a film that is more memorable for its supporting characters than its main protagonist, it deserves to be at the bottom of this list. \"Batman Forever\" (1995) was the third entry in Burton's original franchise, and saw Val Kilmer take over the role of Bruce Wayne from Michael Keaton. This was the first film in the series to feature a \"lighter\" tone, as the directing duties switched from Tim Burton, who has a dark aesthetic, to Joel Schumacher and his farcical debauchery. </p><p>While the film performed decently at the box office, \"Batman Forever\" received mixed reviews from both audiences and critics. Jim Carrey and Tommy Lee Jones as the film's villains Riddler and Two-Face, respectively, garnered the most praise. However, poor CGI, a one-note performance by Kilmer, and the tonal departure from the previous two movies didn't sit well with fans. It also didn't help that Kilmer had zero chemistry with co-star Nicole Kidman, who played Bruce Wayne's love interest, Dr. Chase Meridian. </p><p>The film isn't a total loss. At least it introduced Chris O'Donnell's Robin, complete with a backstory lifted directly from the source material. O'Donnell would be the only actor from the film to return to the franchise, reprising his role as Robin in 1997's \"Batman & Robin.\" Still, there's little doubt about it: \"Batman Forever\" is the worst Batman film to date.</p><h2>Batman (1966)</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/batman-movies-ranked-from-worst-to-best/8-batman-1966-1628545065.jpg\" /><p>Fans of the OG \"Batman\" series no doubt love this feature film, which includes most of the television show's main cast. In their first feature-length movie, Batman (Adam West) and Robin (Burt Ward) work together to take down some of Gotham's most formidable foes, like the Joker (Cesar Romero), the Penguin (Burgess Meredith), and Catwoman (Lee Meriwether). The film was released following the end of the show's first season, hyping up the series and satiating the appetites of fans over the break. </p><p>While the film is a lot of fun and full of goofy scenes, including the infamous shark attack on Batman, it's pretty much just more of the same stuff that we'd previously seen on the television show. There's no real plot and no real consequences for the villains, who would go on to appear in seasons two and three of the TV show, free of any repercussions from their actions in the movie. Also, Meriwether, who took over the role from Julie Newmar, is the least impressive on-screen Catwoman, which doesn't really help matters. </p><p>The film performed moderately well at the box office, but gained more notoriety and a larger fanbase in subsequent years thanks to video rentals and the occasional rebroadcast on ABC. Despite the film's lack of continuity, its cast was brought back in 2013 as part of new comic book series based on the television show. In 2016, West and Ward played Bruce and Dick Grayson again in \"Return of the Caped Crusaders,\" an animated movie based on <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/batman-return-of-the-caped-crusaders-sequel/\">an unproduced episode of the show</a>.</p><h2>Batman & Robin</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/batman-movies-ranked-from-worst-to-best/7-batman-robin-1628545065.jpg\" /><p>If \"Batman Forever\" was the first step towards a return to a campier Batman, \"Batman & Robin\" was a full-out run. George Clooney steps into the role of Bruce Wayne this time around, while O'Donnell returns as Dick Grayson, aka Robin. The film also features multiple villains, including Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze, Uma Thurman as Poison Ivy, and a bootleg version of Bane. Alicia Silverstone plays Batgirl, in the one and only time the character has been featured in a live-action film (although<a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-new-batgirl-is-in-the-heights-star-leslie-grace/\"> a new Batgirl film</a> is currently in production). </p><p>\"Batman & Robin\" turns the goofiness up several notches this time, including new costumes that emphasize the characters' nipples, cringe-worthy dialogue from both the heroes and the villains, and female characters who have nothing to do but stand around and strike sultry poses. Joel Schumacher returns to direct as well, though this was the last Batman film he was attached to. </p><p>To some, this film seems to be an excuse to sell children toys. To others, it's an absurd look at just how ridiculous the world of a superhero can be. The film is often referred to as the worst movie made, and it's the lowest-grossing Batman film to date. However, from our perspective, being notoriously bad is better than being straight-up boring. </p><h2>Batman Begins</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/batman-movies-ranked-from-worst-to-best/6-batman-begins-1628545065.jpg\" /><p>Eight years after \"Batman & Robin\" bombed at the box office, Warner Bros. resurrected the Batman franchise with the help of indie director Christopher Nolan (\"Memento\"). Nolan cast Christian Bale in the lead role, and surrounded him with a talented supporting cast that included Michael Caine as Alfred Pennyworth, Gary Oldman as James Gordon, Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes, Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, and Liam Neeson as Ra's al Ghul. The film is a return to the darker tone of the Keaton films, albeit with a bigger emphasis on realism, and revived the audience's emotional investment in the title character. </p><p>\"Batman Begins\" was a critical and box office success, with many fans happy to see the franchise return to a grittier tone after the previous two installments. The franchise's \"back to basics\" method utilized traditional stunt choreography and miniature effects in lieu of CGI, and it was all the better for it. Additional praise was given to Bale's performance, the emotional weight of the movie, the action sequences, and the score. </p><p>Christian Bale would be the longest-running actor to play Batman, donning the cowl for a consecutive three solo films, better known as \"The Dark Knight Trilogy.\" He is widely regarded as the second-best Batman of the franchise, coming in only behind Michael Keaton. Many of the supporting characters would continue to co-star alongside Bale, though the character of Rachel Dawes was recast for the following film, \"The Dark Knight.\"</p><h2>Batman V Superman: Dawn Of Justice</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/batman-movies-ranked-from-worst-to-best/5-batman-v-superman-dawn-of-justice-1628545065.jpg\" /><p>Technically a sequel to the Superman film \"Man of Steel,\" \"Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice\" is just as pretentious as it sounds. The storyline was certainly ambitious, bringing together two of DC's biggest superheroes and having them fight each other. The idea looks good on paper; the film simply falters when it comes to execution. </p><p>Henry Cavill reprises his role as Superman, but instead of Christian Bale, Ben Affleck was cast as Batman, thereby giving the character a cinematic reboot. Affleck is fine in the role, if a little one-note at times, and the supporting cast -- which includes Amy Adams as Lois Lane, Laurence Fishburne as Perry White, and Diane Lane as Martha Kent -- do the best they can with the material they're given. However, the film is saturated with poor CGI effects, a flimsy storyline that is full of plot holes, and amateurish writing, serving as an anti-climactic introduction to the DCEU's Justice League.</p><p>However, the film has one big saving grace: the introduction of Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman, although the character is never called by this name. This marks the first live-action cinematic portrayal of Wonder Woman, and her entrance during the final battle is one of the most-watched and most memorable scenes in \"Batman v. Superman.\"</p><h2>The Dark Knight Rises</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/batman-movies-ranked-from-worst-to-best/4-the-dark-knight-rises-1628545065.jpg\" /><p>All good things must come to an end. \"The Dark Knight Rises\" is a satisfying conclusion to the Dark Knight trilogy, wrapping up existing storylines while leaving the fates of some characters open-ended. It helps that the film draws inspiration from a few comic book storylines, most notably 1993's \"Knightfall,\" 1986's \"The Dark Knight Returns,\" and 1999's \"No Man's Land.\"</p><p>Bale returns for his final appearance as Batman, while Anne Hathaway joins him as Selina Kyle, in addition to Tom Hardy as Bane and Marion Cotillard as Talia al Ghul. \"The Dark Knight Rises\" received praise for its screenplay, action sequences, emotional depth, and various performances, including Hathaway's anti-hero take on Catwoman and Joseph Gordon-Levitt as a GCPD officer who may be Bruce Wayne's successor</p><p>It's also worth mentioning that \"The Dark Knight Rises\" is one of the few entries in the franchise to garner multiple awards, including ones for cinematography and acting. The film received the prestigious AFI Movie of the Year Award in 2012, a Hollywood Film Award for Cotillard's performance, and a Saturn Award and Teen Choice Award for Hathaway's work in the film. </p><h2>Batman Returns</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/batman-movies-ranked-from-worst-to-best/3-batman-returns-1628545065.jpg\" /><p>Following the huge box office success of \"Batman\" in 1989, a second entry into the franchise was fast-tracked. The film, titled \"Batman Returns,\" works on many different levels. One of the most layered entries on this list, \"Batman Returns\" centers on themes of family, identity, hope, and vengeance. Michael Keaton and Tim Burton return as the lead character and the director, respectively, for a sequel that also includes Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman, Danny DeVito as the Penguin, and Christopher Walken as Max Shreck. </p><p>There's nothing quite like Burton's lush, gothic cinematography; you can always tell when he's at directing a film. In \"Batman Returns\" audiences are transported to Gotham City during the holiday season. Each scene is as opulent as the last, whether it's a shot of the Batcave or a swanky holiday party. The cast does a marvelous job as well. DeVito and Walken revel in playing the film's villains, while Pfeiffer's Catwoman may be her career-defining performance. Keaton and Pfeiffer have amazing chemistry, making fans root for them as a couple, which only makes their ultimate fate all the more tragic. </p><p>The film was so successful that a Catwoman spin-off starring Pfeiffer was planned, but eventually landed in development hell. This may have been for the best; it eventually became Halle Berry's 2004 bomb \"Catwoman,\" which was a huge disappointment both critically and financially. </p><h2>The Dark Knight</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/batman-movies-ranked-from-worst-to-best/2-the-dark-knight-1628545065.jpg\" /><p>The success of \"Batman Begins\" reinvigorated the franchise, and Christopher Nolan upped the ante with the movie's sequel. \"The Dark Knight\" revived one of the biggest-ever rivalries in superhero comics, putting Christian Bale as Batman against Heath Ledger as the Joker. Maggie Gyllenhaal steps in as Rachel Dawes, originally played by Katie Holmes, while Aaron Eckhart joins the cast as Harvey Dent, who becomes the villainous Two-Face. </p><p>There's not a weak link in this film at all. The cast is top notch, the stakes are high, and the pacing is on point, making \"The Dark Knight\" the most intense entry on this list. Ledger's turn as the Joker was a career-defining moment for the young actor, who tragically died eight months before the film was released. His work won him a posthumous Academy Award for best supporting actor. This film holds the title of the fourth highest-grossing film of all time, as well as the highest-grossing film of 2008.   </p><p>What's special about \"The Dark Knight,\" though, is the onscreen magic between Bale and Ledger, who lived and breathed their roles throughout the filming process. Ledger even commented on how hard it was for him to shut his portrayal of the Joker off in order to go home and be with his family. </p><h2>Batman (1989)</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/batman-movies-ranked-from-worst-to-best/1-batman-1989-1628545065.jpg\" /><p>1989's \"Batman\" revolutionized the superhero film, reinvigorating a genre that had been in a lull since the days of Christopher Reeve's first few \"Superman\" movies. Michael Keaton, who up until then had been known as a comedic actor, was cast as Bruce Wayne, while Tim Burton signed on as a director, indicating that the character and his world -- including Kim Basinger as reporter Vicki Vale, Pat Hingle as Commissioner Gordon, and Billy Dee Williams as Harvey Dent -- were in good hands. As the city of Gotham and its various denizens were introduced, it felt like scenes had been lifted straight from the pages of comic books. And then, of course, there was the real draw: Jack Nicholson as Jack Napier, aka the Joker. </p><p>\"Batman\" was made on a budget of $48 million and went on to gross over $400 million at the box office, making it the fifth highest-grossing film ever at the time of its release. The movie received multiple award nominations and inspired the equally successful \"Batman: The Animated Series,\" which ultimately paved the way for the DC animated universe. </p><p>Keaton and Nicholson steal the show, each one stepping into the role of hero and villain as if they were born to play these characters. Keaton is brooding and heroic as the Dark Knight, and Nicholson is appropriately creepy and intimidating as the Joker. The supporting cast does well on their own, too, with Basinger's Vicki Vale serving as the audience's point-of-view character. \"Batman\" set the bar for modern marketing in Hollywood and established superhero movies as the go-to source for big, blockbuster spectacle, an influence that can be felt on the silver screen to this day. </p><p>Read this next: <a

Lawsuit","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/621082/after-two-months-disney-and-scarlett-johansson-settle-lawsuit/","description":"<img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/after-two-months-disney-and-scarlett-johansson-settle-lawsuit/intro-1633050294.jpg\" /><p dir=\"ltr\">After about two months, Disney and Scarlett Johansson have officially become friends again. According to <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/scarlett-johansson-disney-settle-black-widow-lawsuit-1235022598/#?utm_source=onesignal\">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, the \"Black Widow\" star and the streaming giant have settled the <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/582976/scarlett-johansson-sues-disney-over-black-widow-streaming-release/\">lawsuit she filed against them in late July</a>.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">However, the terms of the deal were not disclosed to the outlet.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">\"I am happy to have resolved our differences with Disney,\" Johansson told THR in a statement on Thursday, September 30, 2021. \"I'm incredibly proud of the work we've done together over the years and have greatly enjoyed my creative relationship with the team. I look forward to continuing our collaboration in years to come.\"</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Disney Studios chairman Alan Bergman also told the publication, \"I'm very pleased that we have been able to come to a mutual agreement with Scarlett Johansson regarding 'Black Widow.' We appreciate her contributions to the Marvel Cinematic Universe and look forward to working together on a number of upcoming projects, including Disney's 'Tower of Terror.'\"</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Well, that was quick. Usually, regular, everyday lawsuits take months or years to settle, let alone Hollywood ones. But it appears that the Marvel lead took the necessary steps to preserve her earnings while Disney managed to keep things out of court.</p><h2>Why Did Scarlett Johansson Sue Disney?</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/after-two-months-disney-and-scarlett-johansson-settle-lawsuit/why-did-scarlett-johansson-sue-disney-1633050294.jpg\" /><p dir=\"ltr\">In July, the \"Jojo Rabbit'' star filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles Superior Court and claimed that the major studio skimped out on the film's box office potential in an effort to continue to grow its Disney+ streaming service, which has many competitors in the market at this point. Disney responded and noted that Johansson was paid $20 million for the film.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In the filing, Johansson alleged that \"Black Widow\" had been guaranteed an exclusive theatrical release when she signed her deal. When the film was simultaneously released on Disney+, she claims the studio came in breach of her contract. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">Disney then went on to speak out and attempted to shed a light on the plight of the industry amid the pandemic, which <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/583037/women-in-film-reframe-and-times-up-call-disney-out-for-its-abhorrent-attack-of-scarlett-johansson-in-legal-battle/\">wasn't exactly Johansson's point</a>. </p><h2>What Was Disney's Response To The Suit?</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/after-two-months-disney-and-scarlett-johansson-settle-lawsuit/what-was-disneys-response-to-the-suit-1633050294.jpg\" /><p dir=\"ltr\">The studio issued a statement in response to Johansson's claims. \"The lawsuit is especially sad and distressing in its callous disregard for the horrific and prolonged global effects of the COVID-19 pandemic,\" a Disney spokesperson said at the time. \"Disney has fully complied with Ms. Johansson's contract and furthermore, the release of 'Black Widow' on Disney+ with Premiere Access has significantly enhanced her ability to earn additional compensation on top of the $20M she has received to date.\"</p><p dir=\"ltr\">CAA co-chairman Bryan Lourd <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/caa-co-chair-backs-scarlett-johansson-says-disney-shamelessly-attacked-stars-character-1234990777/\">defended Johansson</a> after the comments and alleged that the actress was having her character tampered with amid the claims from the studio.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">\"They have shamelessly and falsely accused Ms. Johansson of being insensitive to the global COVID pandemic, in an attempt to make her appear to be someone they and I know she isn't,\" he told THR in a statement in July. \"The company included her salary in their press statement in an attempt to weaponize her success as an artist and businesswoman, as if that were something she should be ashamed of.\"</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The talent agent added, \"Scarlett is extremely proud of the work that she, and all of the actors, writers, directors, producers, and the Marvel creative team have been a part of for well over a decade. [...] Disney's direct attack on her character and all else they implied is beneath the company that many of us in the creative community have worked with successfully for decades.\"</p><p dir=\"ltr\">We will update you as more information becomes available.</p><p>Read this next: <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/594573/every-pre-mcu-marvel-movie-ranked/\">Every Pre-MCU Marvel Movie Ranked</a></p><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/621082/after-two-months-disney-and-scarlett-johansson-settle-lawsuit/\">After Two Months, Disney and Scarlett Johansson Settle Lawsuit</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=oJ5Af0tr4UI:m4abhXKCOZo:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=oJ5Af0tr4UI:m4abhXKCOZo:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=oJ5Af0tr4UI:m4abhXKCOZo:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=oJ5Af0tr4UI:m4abhXKCOZo:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=oJ5Af0tr4UI:m4abhXKCOZo:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=oJ5Af0tr4UI:m4abhXKCOZo:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/oJ5Af0tr4UI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 01 Oct 2021 01:07:43 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/after-two-months-disney-and-scarlett-johansson-settle-lawsuit/intro-1633050294.jpg","linkMd5":"cc1d2cd92fba95d5c23694d0a6b1c0f3","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn7@2020_3/2021/10/01/02-08-24-835_9a057f17e2c50890.webp","destWidth":780,"destHeight":438,"sourceBytes":53259,"destBytes":17236,"author":"Lex Briscuso","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/after-two-months-disney-and-scarlett-johansson-settle-lawsuit/intro-1633050294.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn7@2020_3/2021/10/01/02-08-24-835_9a057f17e2c50890.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/after-two-months-disney-and-scarlett-johansson-settle-lawsuit/why-did-scarlett-johansson-sue-disney-1633050294.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn3@2020_4/2021/10/01/02-08-28-874_e26a8a5ced81b56a.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/after-two-months-disney-and-scarlett-johansson-settle-lawsuit/what-was-disneys-response-to-the-suit-1633050294.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn96@2020_2/2021/10/01/02-08-29-126_7e18094c2ac79b8c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn91@2020_6/2021/10/01/02-08-28-889_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=oJ5Af0tr4UI:m4abhXKCOZo:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn19@2020_5/2021/10/01/02-08-28-489_da7b7b648ada34af.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn32@2020_5/2021/10/01/02-08-29-180_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=oJ5Af0tr4UI:m4abhXKCOZo:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn42@2020_1/2021/10/01/02-08-28-681_4393a11c4650323d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/oJ5Af0tr4UI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn72@2020_3/2021/10/01/02-08-28-441_7090b1c96a032417.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1633054082371},{"createdTime":"2021-10-01 10:08:02","updatedTime":"2021-10-01 10:08:02","title":"Sexy Beasts Season 2 Trailer: Abandon All Hope, Ye Who Watch This Nightmare Fuel","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/621077/sexy-beasts-season-2-trailer-abandon-all-hope-ye-who-watch-this-nightmare-fuel/","description":"<img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/sexy-beasts-season-2-trailer-abandon-all-hope-ye-who-watch-this-nightmare-fuel/intro-1633049415.jpg\" /><p dir=\"ltr\">Whoever lit the black flame candle, played with a Ouija board, or angered an old witch to hex us all with a second season of \"<a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/581913/sexy-beasts-trailer/\">Sexy Beasts,</a>\" show yourself now or accept that my current greatest desire is to go full Liam Neeson in \"Taken\" and track you down. Netflix released the trailer today for the second season of their \"Love is Blind\" meets \"The Masked Singer\" dating show and all of us are now haunted by it.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">When the show debuted back in July, people went bananas over what looked to be their new favorite source of trash therapy. The premise is simple: it's a dating show where the contestants wear prosthetic masks and are transformed into monsters, animals, and whatever other weird creature the makeup artists have in store for the lucky suitors.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Anyway, here's the trailer. It's hella cursed. You've been warned.</p><h2>Sexy Beasts Season 2 Trailer</h2><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/bKJOsy3Kf18\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe><p dir=\"ltr\">The trailer absolutely leans into the feedback of the first season, noting reviews comparing the show to \"a sign of the end times,\" \"the rock bottom of culture,\" and \"your worst nightmares.\" It's clear that Netflix is living for the insults hurled at the show. It doesn't look like much has changed from the first to the second season, other than a new cast of characters and more recipes for waking nightmares.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">So far we've seen a rabbit, a tiger, some sort of storybook ogre, an armadillo, a lion, a red Medusa, a bird, a zombie/Frankenstein's monster hybrid, and some other unrecognizable critters that look like something from a first-grade monster illustration. The show continues to be narrated by comedian and star of \"Catastrophe,\" Rob Delaney.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">At one point a lizard, dinosaur, scale-man ... thing(?) notes how beautiful someone is, saying \"I couldn't see it through the mask.\" Well, literally everyone on the first season of the show was a knock-out, so I don't know what this lizard was expecting. The show claims the goal is to force people to get to know one another and judge their prospective partner beyond physical appearance, but considering everyone beneath the makeup is still conventionally hot, it defeats the entire purpose.</p><h2>Is Sexy Beasts Any Fun?</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/sexy-beasts-season-2-trailer-abandon-all-hope-ye-who-watch-this-nightmare-fuel/is-sexy-beasts-any-fun-1633049415.jpg\" /><p dir=\"ltr\">Based on the show that aired in the UK in 2014 and again in America in 2015 on A&E, \"Sexy Beasts\" is a show about unlikable people in ridiculously cool costumes going on dates looking for love. Unfortunately, once you take away the costumes, we're left with a dating show that feels a lot like a mid-2000s dating show on MTV. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">Some of the conversations are downright <em>cringey</em>, some of the people are complete jerks, and for a show that's centered around finding love despite appearances, all anyone can talk about after the masks are off is how relieved they are that the person they chose is hot or how happy they are the prospective dater finds them attractive. The relief is also super annoying to watch, considering the makeup only hides their hair and faces, and not the fact all of them <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/dear-reality-dating-shows-fat-people-fuck-too\">have fit bodies</a>. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">Apparently, we can cover a person in prosthetic makeup to look like a troll or a bird before we can consider believing a fat person would be a desirable candidate on a blind date.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Season 2 will premiere on Netflix with six new episodes on October 7, 2021.</p><p>Read this next: <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/587301/the-15-best-90s-comedies-ranked/\">The 15 Best '90s Comedies Ranked</a></p><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/621077/sexy-beasts-season-2-trailer-abandon-all-hope-ye-who-watch-this-nightmare-fuel/\">Sexy Beasts Season 2 Trailer: Abandon All Hope, Ye Who Watch This Nightmare Fuel</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=qz457r-LkYE:c9CZH6sr3qs:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=qz457r-LkYE:c9CZH6sr3qs:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=qz457r-LkYE:c9CZH6sr3qs:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=qz457r-LkYE:c9CZH6sr3qs:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=qz457r-LkYE:c9CZH6sr3qs:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=qz457r-LkYE:c9CZH6sr3qs:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/qz457r-LkYE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 01 Oct 2021 00:52:16 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/sexy-beasts-season-2-trailer-abandon-all-hope-ye-who-watch-this-nightmare-fuel/intro-1633049415.jpg","linkMd5":"fd32cb544ed9b0c988c28f43c74a7f87","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn93@2020_4/2021/10/01/02-08-02-739_3f4efd6bda9c32a0.webp","destWidth":780,"destHeight":438,"sourceBytes":83724,"destBytes":24492,"author":"BJ Colangelo","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/sexy-beasts-season-2-trailer-abandon-all-hope-ye-who-watch-this-nightmare-fuel/intro-1633049415.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn93@2020_4/2021/10/01/02-08-02-739_3f4efd6bda9c32a0.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/sexy-beasts-season-2-trailer-abandon-all-hope-ye-who-watch-this-nightmare-fuel/is-sexy-beasts-any-fun-1633049415.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn8@2020_4/2021/10/01/02-08-28-520_8d7e7f69a6ba66ca.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn91@2020_6/2021/10/01/02-08-28-889_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=qz457r-LkYE:c9CZH6sr3qs:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn55@2020_1/2021/10/01/02-08-28-724_b8a1ed003606f49d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn32@2020_5/2021/10/01/02-08-29-180_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=qz457r-LkYE:c9CZH6sr3qs:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn50@2020_1/2021/10/01/02-08-28-640_1b1296ea3fea2bb2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/qz457r-LkYE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn92@2020_1/2021/10/01/02-08-28-544_9328529604a57c95.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1633054082370}],"record":{"createdTime":"2021-10-01 10:08:02","updatedTime":"2021-10-01 10:08:02","feedId":21,"fetchDate":"Fri, 01 Oct 2021 02:08:02 +0000","fetchMs":157,"handleMs":1036,"totalMs":43952,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":10,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"af0629e1ae74a27744b4cbd27b40a78e","hostName":"us-018*","requestId":"9a2df9dada9f41b2a4821c447aa0157e_21","contentType":"text/xml;
