And, how to effectively pack a bag.</p>\n<p>When we recently asked former and current members of the military who <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/artofmanliness/?hl=en\">follow AoM on Instagram</a> for their best packing tips, we got a ton of responses. Far and away the #1 submission was this: Learn to roll your clothes. </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An effective packing technique whether you’re a soldier headed out for a deployment or a civilian headed out for vacation, the Ranger or Army Roll is a method of “folding” your clothes that keeps them both compact and tidy. It makes your clothes look like tight, well-rolled burritos, and minimizes the amount they wrinkle, as well as their footprint in your bag. Ranger-rolled clothes take up less space in your suitcase and keep it better organized. On the latter front, you can also roll up outfits — shirt, socks, underwear — together into a single, action-ready pouch.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The only downside to the Ranger Roll is that it does take longer to do than simpler folds — at least before you’ve practiced it a lot and gotten the technique down pat. You’ve really got to focus on making a nice, tight roll for each piece of clothing in order for this method to work. But the tradeoff in time is worth it, as it allows you to pack more in a single bag, saving you from schlepping around multiple pieces of luggage and paying the attendant fees for those extra bags if you’re flying. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Below we highlight how to Ranger roll four different pieces of clothing. Follow the instructions with military-esque precision, and you’ll be packing your bag like a seasoned veteran in no time.</span></p>\n<p>And if you’re curious as to what additional packing tips came up in our Instagram survey, here are some of the other most popular responses (thanks to everyone who submitted their tips!):</p>\n<div dir=\"auto\">\n<div dir=\"ltr\">\n<ul><li>Collect and assemble everything you need and lay it out to create a visual checklist; then pack it in bag.</li>\n<li>Pack the stuff you’ll need first/most frequently on top of the bag and in easy-to-access side pockets.</li>\n<li>Pack the bigger stuff first; the little things will fit in the cracks (good packing advice; <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/put-the-big-rocks-in-first-video/\">also good general life advice</a>).</li>\n<li>Pack light: “ounces makes pounds.”</li>\n<li>Stick your rolled up socks into your shoes to save room.</li>\n<li>If you’re packing a sea bag, bang it on the floor to settle what you’ve packed already and create more room to add items.</li>\n<li>If you’re packing a backpack/rucksack, pack the lighter things towards the bottom and the heavier things higher up, close to your back/body.</li>\n</ul><p><img style=\" display: block;

His name is Paul Cartledge, and he’s an ancient historian, professor of Greek culture, and the author of several books on Sparta, including <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PLVWCH9/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=B07PLVWCH9&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess&#38;linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\"><em>Thermopylae: The Battle That Changed the World</em></a>. At the start of the show, Paul describes Sparta’s martial training system which allowed it to become a dominant power in Greece, the Spartans relationship with other city-states, and how they ended up partnering with their sometimes enemy, Athens, in repelling a second Persian invasion. We discuss who made up the famous 300 Spartan warriors who would defend the Grecian pass to the death, how they armed and prepared for combat, and what happened over three days of battle. We end our conversation with the importance of the Spartans’ courageous stand at Thermopylae not only in the outcome of the Greco-Persian Wars, but the course of world history. <br></br><em><br></br>\nIf reading this in an email, click the title of the post to listen to the show.</em></p>\n<h3>Show Highlights</h3>\n<ul><li>What was the Spartans’ educational and training system like?</li>\n<li>What was Sparta’s relationship like with other city-states?</li>\n<li>Why did Sparta get an inkling to take over Greece?</li>\n<li>What led to the Battle of Thermopylae?</li>\n<li>How many soldiers were the Spartans really up against?</li>\n<li>How Spartans equipped themselves, both with weapons and wit </li>\n<li>The intense topography of Thermopylae </li>\n<li>Why did the Spartan’s have so much success at first?</li>\n<li>What led to Leonidas’ downfall?</li>\n<li>What were the lasting impacts of the battle?</li>\n<li>What can modern men take away from this ancient battle?</li>\n</ul><h3>Resources/Articles/People Mentioned in Podcast</h3>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/podcast-461-the-spartan-regime/\">The Spartan Regime</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/courage-vs-boldness-how-to-live-with-spartan-bravery/\">Courage vs. Boldness: How to Live With Spartan Bravery</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/travel-leisure/manly-knowledge/ancient-greece/\">The Spartan Way series</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/podcast-692-the-two-halves-of-the-warriors-life/\">The Two Halves of the Warrior’s Life</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Fetters\">Battle of the Fetters</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/books-about-war/\">43 Books About War Every Man Should Read</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1400031141/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=1400031141&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess&#38;linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\">Herotodus’ <em>Histories</em></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NJL7QO/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=B000NJL7QO&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess&#38;linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\"><em>Gates of Fire</em></a> by Steven Pressfield</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0521521009/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=0521521009&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess&#38;linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\">The Cambridge Illustrated History of Ancient Greece</a></li>\n</ul><h3><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-135934\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/05/cartledge.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"357\" height=\"550\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/05/cartledge.jpg 357w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/05/cartledge-320x493.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 357px) 100vw, 357px\"></img></h3>\n<h3>Listen to the Podcast!

There are few universal social mores to check our behavior, few cultural expectations to direct our courses. No particle of personal identity can be taken for granted. No molecule of meaning may be presumed upon. Within the expansive restrictions of law, you can pretty much dress, say, live, and do whatever you’d like. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On paper, this landscape of unbounded freedom seems like an unmitigated boon.

The human will, no matter how strong, doesn’t have the capacity to both engineer and superintend all of life’s details. It needs positions of command </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of psychic rest. Try to be sovereign over everything, and one’s kingdom turns to dust.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In some area, in some way, you must submit. To a system. To a code. To a faith.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Submission may smack of dependency, weakness, surrender. But it’s in yielding to authority that we gain authority.

But, without fail, there is always “that guy” at a wedding. The guy who is underdressed, embarrasses the couple, or in some other way does something everyone wishes they could forget. We have learned it may be impossible to have a wedding without having “that guy” there — even if we still do our best to minimize his impact on the overall experience. But it is possible for <em>you</em> to not be that guy. So here are a few tips on how to be a wedding guest the couple will be happy they invited.</p>\n<h3>RSVP</h3>\n<p>Etiquette as a wedding guest begins long before you arrive at the venue. You can start your tenure as a guest off well by responding to the invitation promptly. The bride and groom need to know who is attending as soon as possible so that they can plan and purchase accordingly. Make plans around the wedding immediately and respond.</p>\n<p>Pay attention to the specifics of your invitation. If it is addressed to “Brett McKay,” only Brett is invited, no matter how lonely he may be. If the invitation is for “Mr. &#38; Mrs. McKay,” “Brett &#38; Kate McKay,” or “Brett McKay &#38; Guest,” Brett may bring his wife, but no children or friends. Only if the “McKay family” were invited or specific children named would the whole family be welcome. While less common, it is not unheard of for some guests to be invited only to the ceremony or only to the reception. Read the invitation carefully and RSVP only for those guests who are actually invited and will definitely attend.</p>\n<h3>Attire</h3>\n<p>Another extremely important pre-wedding task is to dress yourself appropriately. This task can seem difficult these days. While many invitations used to include a dress code (“white tie,” “black tie,” “formal,” etc.), that is no longer the norm. If your invitation does include <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-dress-for-wedding-date-ceremony/\">a dress code</a>, follow it religiously. Not only do you not want to be the guy that wears jeans while everyone else is wearing tuxedos, but if a couple specifically asks you to dress in a certain manner, it is disrespectful to ignore those wishes.</p>\n<p>Where a lot of confusion arises for men is in the now-more-common instance of an invitation without a dress code. Do not take this as a license to dress as you please. Consider carefully the location and timing of the wedding as well as the couple. If the wedding is in a church or a ballroom, more formal dress will likely be appropriate. Whereas the lately-popular setting of a renovated barn will give you some freedom to <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/cowboy-boots/\">break out those (well-polished) cowboy boots</a>. Likewise, a wedding at 10:00 a.m. with a brunch reception to follow will require a different outfit than one at 6:00 p.m. with a formal dinner.</p>\n<p>Taking these factors into account, your goal should be to be better-dressed than the average attendee without drawing attention to yourself. Here is where having a versatile wardrobe is a valuable asset. For a wedding that does not require a tuxedo, you might wear a neutral or blue (not black, it’s not a funeral) suit and tie to ensure you are well-dressed. If you show up to find yourself immensely overdressed, you can always ditch the tie into your suit pocket or car or leave your jacket draped around a chair. As the night goes on, <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/the-complete-guide-on-how-to-roll-up-your-shirt-sleeves/\">you might even be free to roll up your sleeves</a>. But it is far better to have brought the jacket and tie with you than to find yourself underdressed. And remember: it is perfectly fine to look better than the average guest so long as you are not calling attention to yourself.</p>\n<p>If after thoughtful consideration you simply cannot determine what dress is appropriate, it is far better to ask permission than to beg forgiveness. A few months before the wedding, ask someone in the wedding party (close family, bridesmaid, or groomsman) what attire would be appropriate. Do not ask the bride or groom; they are already worried about many other details and should not have to cater to your lack of intuition. And do not make this call the morning of the wedding as you rummage through your closet; do everyone the courtesy of being prepared and conscientious.</p>\n<p>If all else fails, wear, at a <em>minimum</em>: pants (khakis or slacks), closed-toed dress shoes, a button-down shirt, tie, and a sport coat. Wear colors appropriate for the season.</p>\n<h3>Schedule</h3>\n<p>If this is your first wedding, it might help to know what to expect. There are usually two main features to a wedding: the ceremony and reception. The ceremony is for marrying the bride and groom, and the reception is for celebrating that enormous milestone. Often, a “cocktail hour” will serve as the bridge between these two features while the couple takes photos or space is rearranged. (Actual cocktails may or may not be served.) The reception will usually involve food of some sort, dancing, and some traditional wedding events like the first dance and the bouquet toss. There are many variations on this basic timeline, but most will adhere to that overall structure.</p>\n<h3>Arrival</h3>\n<p>Arrive 30 minutes before the ceremony and proceed directly to an usher or to your seat. There are no exceptions here. If a wedding starts at 6:00, the wedding party is walking down the aisle at 6:00. If you are unavoidably detained and late to the wedding, do everyone the courtesy of standing somewhere no photographer could ever capture your late arrival. Your option at that point is to sneak in after the wedding party is in place and attention diverted to the altar, <em>only</em> if you can do so without drawing attention to yourself. The entire gathering should not have to bear the penalty of being distracted by your tardiness.</p>\n<h3>Electronics</h3>\n<p>Unless a member of the wedding party has specifically instructed you in advance to record or photograph a part of the wedding, keep your phone in your pocket and your camera in the car. At absolutely no point during the ceremony itself should your phone leave your pocket, nor should it even be on. You do not want 100 heads turning toward you as you realize you forgot to silence your obnoxious ringtone.</p>\n<p>You may have a little more liberty to take photos during the reception, but use this liberty sparingly. Most couples have hired a professional photographer to capture their big day. They most assuredly do not need your amateur photography skills to supplement their professional. If you want to capture a private photo with friends or family, do it in a place and at a time during the reception that does not interfere with the larger gathering. Step outside or to a corner. Do not be deceived: the bride and groom do not want you to livestream your poor attempt at the Cupid Shuffle from the middle of the dance floor. If you absolutely must have a picture of the couple’s first dance or cake cutting, find the photographer and ask for her card so that you can discuss obtaining photos from her at a later time.</p>\n<h3><strong>Seating</strong></h3>\n<p>The first two rows on each side of the aisle are generally reserved for close family. Sometimes, these rows will have a “reserved” sign or will be designated by a special floral arrangement or decoration. If you are a friend or distant family not specifically instructed otherwise, do not sit in these rows. If you aren’t seated by an usher, choose to sit as close to those first two rows as possible. It is best that empty seats are left at the back — both because it is easier to accommodate late arrivals there and because full rows close to the altar photograph better.</p>\n<h3>Stand for the Bride</h3>\n<p>Stand when the bride enters and leaves. Often her entry will be signaled by a change in music, and some officiants will ask the audience to rise. But you are a man honoring a lady, and you do not need to be told to rise in her presence. You can be seated when she is fully situated at the altar or when she has left the room/site of the ceremony.</p>\n<h3>Stay Where You Are Intended to Be</h3>\n<p>Weddings are a complex affair often planned for many months at great expense. When a couple chooses a room or site for their ceremony, they intend for their guests to gather there. Unless directed otherwise, they do not want you wandering the grounds or the building. The same goes for the cocktail hour and reception. If the couple hosts a defined cocktail hour in an area separate from the reception space, do not go into the reception until invited. Sweat it out or control your bladder, whatever is required. Your simple act of being where you are intended to be demonstrates your respect for the couple and your own self-control. Plus, it could be that the couple has corralled you to a specific spot to avoid you stumbling into a photo or invading a private moment.</p>\n<h3>Wait Your Turn for Dinner</h3>\n<p>In many cases, dinner is served to you and arrangements/logistics are out of your hands. Simply wait patiently for your meal and be sure you’re at the table when it comes (or you might get skipped over).</p>\n<p>If there is a buffet, conduct yourself decently and wait for the emcee or a waiter to dismiss your table to dinner. The man who rushes out of order to secure his food shows himself a pig. Seconds are not your right. Wedding food is expensive. Whether you are serving yourself or being served, take a moderate amount of food and do not expect more. Many times there will be more food available for a second helping, but, again, don’t be the <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/50-old-fashioned-insults-we-should-bring-back/\">greedy guts</a> rushing to the front of the line.</p>\n<h3>Don’t Crowd the Bride and Groom</h3>\n<p>As important as you may think yourself to the happy couple, they invited many other guests to the wedding they would like to spend time with too. And they probably wouldn’t mind a few minutes to themselves. Do not visit the couple while they are eating unless invited. Many couples used to have a receiving line at which point they would greet all their guests. Some still do, but many now opt to visit guests at individual tables during dinner. In any event, wait until it is clearly your turn to visit with the couple or wait until later in the evening when they are taking a break from the dance floor. Keep any conversations congratulatory and complimentary of the couple: now is not the time to start discussing family conflict or your bad week at work.</p>\n<h3>Don’t Get Drunk</h3>\n<p>The bride and groom most assuredly did not get married so you would have an occasion to get hammered. Whatever your personal opinions on alcohol and your perceived tolerance for imbibement, you should never drink so much that anyone would even mistake you for drunk. Drunks make terrible guests, and your lowered inhibition will make you more likely to violate one of these other rules.</p>\n<h3>Toasts</h3>\n<p>Unless the couple themselves asked you in advance to give a toast, you are not invited to give one. There are few things more awkward for a couple and their guests than to sit through an unending drone of uninvited and unprepared speeches. Moreover, an invitation to give a toast is an honor. Do not usurp that honor and thereby devalue the invited toasters. Your role during the toasts is to laugh, cry, and clap where appropriate. Support the toasters and the couple by being a good audience. If you must convey your feelings to the couple, save your remarks for a brief, private moment.</p>\n<h3>Stay</h3>\n<p>Do not leave after the ceremony, or after dinner, or after cake, or when you are tired of the affair. Stay until you send the bride and groom off. You were not invited to a free meal or to a dance party; you were invited to a wedding. An enormous amount of time and money went into this event. The bride and groom asked you to come, witness their marriage, celebrate with them, and send them away into their new life. Do not think that if you just slip out it will have no effect on the crowd left at the end of the reception. Many others will have the same thought and the crowd will quickly dwindle, leaving the couple feeling unappreciated. After all the effort the couple put into the event and feeding you, the least you can do is stay awhile to see them off, even if you are bored or tired or would rather be somewhere else.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Weddings are a wonderful event. If you have been invited to one, it is because you are important to the couple in some way and they would like for you to share in the joy of the day. But the purpose and focus of a wedding are the bride and groom. This is not an event for your entertainment; you are there to honor the bride and groom. You can do so in the way you conduct yourself from the moment you are invited until you see the couple off.</p>\n<hr></hr><p><em>Paige and Cody are the owners of <a href=\"https://willowwildflower.weebly.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://willowwildflower.weebly.com/&#38;source=gmail&#38;ust=1621613557994000&#38;usg=AFQjCNGx5QPvrWycx149tZEYVTqAg38i_Q\">Willow + Wildflower</a> — a Nashville-based wedding coordination team focused on bringing couples’ dream days to life.

Well, it starts with simply opening your mouth. From there, my guest says, you want to progress through a conversation, or perhaps a series of conversations, in a particular sequence of stages that will form an effective on-ramp towards a stronger relationship.</p>\n<p>Her name is <a href=\"http://www.judyapps.co.uk/\">Judy Apps</a>, she’s a speaking and voice coach and the author of several books on communication, including<em> <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JJTUSGY/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=B00JJTUSGY&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess&#38;linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\">The Art of Conversation</a></em>. Today Judy and I discuss that art, beginning with why it’s so important to learn. We then get into the different levels a conversation should progress through in order to build intimacy and smoothly segue into discussing the things that matter most. Judy explains how to bring the kind of energy to a conversation that creates connection, and two exercises you can use to overcome the self-consciousness that can thwart that energy. Along the way, we discuss how conversation is both a game that you can have fun practicing, and a dance that can flow into some of life’s most magical moments.</p>\n<p><em>If reading this in an email, click the title of the post to listen to the show.</em></p>\n<h3>Show Highlights</h3>\n<ul><li>Where do most people falter when it comes to conversation?</li>\n<li>How is conversation like a dance?</li>\n<li>How should you approach conversation with someone new?</li>\n<li>Why you need to embrace small talk </li>\n<li>Thinking vs feeling in conversation </li>\n<li>Progressing through levels of conversation to get deeper and more intimate </li>\n<li>Conversational experiments to try out </li>\n<li>What should you do when you get anxious before or during a conversation?</li>\n<li>The benefits of thinking of conversation as a game </li>\n<li>How much tone and body language matters when conversing with people </li>\n</ul><h3>Resources/Articles/People Mentioned in Podcast</h3>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/podcast-634-how-to-design-conversations-that-matter/\">How to Design Conversations That Matter</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/the-power-of-conversation-a-lesson-from-cs-lewis-and-jrr-tolkien/\" data-mil=\"114131\">The Power of Conversation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/the-art-of-conversation-how-to-avoid-conversational-narcissism/\" data-mil=\"114131\">How to Avoid Conversational Narcissism</a> </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-start-a-conversation/\" data-mil=\"114131\">How to Start and Sustain Conversations</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-conversation-builds-character/\" data-mil=\"114131\">How Conversation Builds Character</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/podcast-155-reclaiming-conversation/\" data-mil=\"114131\">Reclaiming Conversation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/the-art-of-conversation/\" data-mil=\"114131\">The Art of Conversation: 5 Do’s and Don’ts</a> </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-make-small-talk/\">How to Make Small Talk</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-make-small-talk/\">Why You Need to Embrace Small Talk</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/social-briefing-7-initiate-small-talk-using-method/\">How to Initiate Small Talk</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/why-you-should-talk-to-strangers/\">Why You Should Talk to Strangers</a></li>\n</ul><h3><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-135911\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/05/apps.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"354\" height=\"550\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/05/apps.jpg 354w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/05/apps-320x497.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 354px) 100vw, 354px\"></img></h3>\n<h3>Connect With Judy</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.judyapps.co.uk/\">Judy’s website</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/judyapps\">Judy on Twitter</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/judy_apps_how_your_voice_touches_others_the_true_meaning_of_what_you_say\">How Your Voice Touches Others</a> (Judy’s TED talk)</p>\n<h3>Listen to the Podcast!

This article was originally published in July 2018.</em></p>\n<p>When Ernest Hemingway was working on the manuscript of a book about his safari in Africa, he played with a passage (which he later deleted) that listed all the things he loved and loved to do. He began with seeing, hearing, eating, drinking, sleeping, and reading; looking at pictures, cities, oceans, fishes, and fighting; thinking and observing; being in boats and battles or on saddle horses with “guns between your legs.”</p>\n<p>The list continued down the page:</p>\n<blockquote><p>To watch the snow, rain, grass, tents, winds, changes of season . . . To talk, to come back and see your children, one woman, another woman, various women, but only one woman really, some friends, speed, animals . . . courage, co-ordination, the migration of fishes, many rivers, fishing, forests, fields, all birds that fly, dogs, roads, all good writing, all good painting, the principles of revolution, the practice of revolution, the Christian theory of anarchy, the seasonal variation of the Gulf Stream, its monthly variation, the trade winds, counter currents, the Spanish bull ring, cafes, wines, the Prado, Pamplona, Navarra, Santiago de Compostella, Sheridan, Casper, Wyoming, Michigan, Florida, Arkansas, Montana.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Still not feeling he had encapsulated the things of life that filled his heart, he made another attempt:</p>\n<blockquote><p>To stay in places and to leave, to trust, to distrust, to no longer believe and believe again, to care about fishes, the different winds, the changes of the seasons, to see what happens, to be out in boats, to sit in the saddle, to watch the snow come, to watch it go, to hear rain on the tent, to know where I can find what I want.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In reference to the above, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2ucmhRg\">Hemingway’s biographer, Carlos Baker</a>, comments: “What he really wanted was a total immersion in the sensuous experience of living. The lists were nothing more than verbal talismans to help him achieve such an end.”</p>\n<p>Hemingway had a zeal for making the most of life, not only in his professional vocation, but in his leisure time as well. Papa always wanted to be where the action was, not just as a spectator but as a participant; he wanted to experience what the world had to offer firsthand, with all five senses. In this he certainly succeeded, becoming not only a war correspondent and writer of classic novels, but a hunter, fisherman, sailor, amateur boxer and bullfighter, and world traveler. Few others in modern history have seen, heard, smelled, tasted, and touched so much.</p>\n<p>How’d he do it all?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/ernest-hemingway-as-a-case-study-in-living-the-t-shaped-life/\">As discussed previously</a>, it was a strict daily writing routine that kept up his output of words.</p>\n<p>What may be surprising to learn about Hemingway’s life, however, is that the same disciplined approach he took to his job, was what allowed him to have so much fun outside of it.</p>\n<h3>Hemingway’s Approach to the “Challenge of Enjoyment”<strong> </strong></h3>\n<blockquote><p>I suppose the most remarkable thing about Ernest is that he has found time to do the things most men only dream about. He has had the courage, the initiative, the time, the enjoyment to travel, to digest it all, to write, to create it, in a sense. —A. E. Hotchner, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3b8F8Rz\"><em>Papa Hemingway: A Personal Memoir</em></a></p></blockquote>\n<p>Papa embraced what he called “the fiesta concept of life.” He was always seeking after excitement and adventure and looking to have a “hell of a good time.” Hemingway’s friend, A. E. Hotchner, “had never seen anyone with such an aura of fun and well-being. He radiated it and everyone [around him] responded.” He was always looking forward to what was around the corner, and began each day with high expectations for what it would bring. In fact, he typically stood on the balls of his feet, like a boxer, seemingly ever ready to move, to fight, to leap into action, to <em>go</em>.</p>\n<p>To get at the fun he so relished, we popularly imagine Hemingway taking a loose, fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants, party-on kind of approach to life.</p>\n<p>But as Hotchner explains, Papa’s philosophy of leisure was actually the opposite of spontaneous:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Ernest’s confidence in the unending order of good times was founded on a very disciplined point of view toward the hours of his days and weeks. <strong>Each day was a challenge of enjoyment, and he would plan it out as a field general plans a campaign</strong>.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Hemingway felt that “good times should be orchestrated and not left to the uncertainties of chance,” Hotchner writes, and he “planned fun as seriously as work, for he considered them of equal importance to Well-Being.”</p>\n<p>The gusto with which Hemingway attacked his “leisure” time not only created incredible adventures for himself, but for those who enjoyed the exhilaration of being pulled into his orbit. As one friend remembered, “He generated excitement because he was so intense about everything, about writing and boxing, about good food and drink. Everything we did took on a new importance when he was with us.”</p>\n<p>The fact that Hemingway rigorously planned out his good times, Hotchner adds, <strong>“</strong>did not mean that there was no flexibility.” A visit to Paris that was supposed to be a two-day trip, could turn into a two-month stay. But it did mean that Hemingway, whether at home or on vacation, had a detailed idea of what he wanted to do each day — the places he wanted to visit, the people he wanted to see, the activities he wanted to partake of, the restaurants and bars in which he wanted to eat and drink. As Hotchner observes, each day “was set up carefully before it dawned or, at the very latest, at its dawning.”</p>\n<h3>Plan for Good Times</h3>\n<p>Hemingway wanted a life filled with excitement, drama, and real interest, and understood that those qualities wouldn’t just happen — they had to be intentionally planned for and created.</p>\n<p>It’s a secret to good livin’ that commonly goes unrecognized. Even those who plan out their work days, don’t think of planning out their leisure time. Folks head into the weekend without any idea of what they’d like to do with it, and end up piddling around the house, surrendering to the inertia of television, and feeling restless come Monday that they let another 48 hours of potential fun slip away. Or they take trips without a real itinerary in mind, spend the days a little aimlessly, and return home feeling like they could have made more of their rare vacation time.</p>\n<p>Plotting your “off hours” can help you make much more out of them.</p>\n<p>It doesn’t mean scheduling out each hour of your evenings or weekends, nor carrying around a clipboard of activities on your vacation, and continually checking your watch to keep yourself moving between them. It doesn’t rule out flexibility, changing plans, and taking unforeseen detours. It doesn’t even necessarily require planning too far ahead.</p>\n<p>Rather, it’s as simple as having an idea for an activity you want to do and a new restaurant you want to try before the weekend starts. For example, <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/creating-a-positive-family-culture-how-to-plan-and-lead-a-weekly-family-meeting/\">at our weekly family meeting</a>, the McKays try to <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/my-8-week-microadventure-challenge/\">pick one microadventure</a> to do on Friday evening or Saturday. We’ve found that without this preset plan, we tend to fritter away the weekend without doing much of anything.</p>\n<p>Planning your leisure time is also as simple as spending 20 minutes each night you’re on vacation, looking at travel sites or books, and deciding on a few activities you’d like to do the next day. That way in the morning, you’re ready to hit the ground running.</p>\n<p>It’s also a matter of planning those trips, period. Turning those “We ought to do that someday” thoughts into reality.</p>\n<p>It’s worth generating a list of all the things you love and love to do, just as Hemingway once did. Then think about how to get more of them in your life more frequently. Then create a plan to make it happen.</p>\n<p>Don’t leave your good times to chance.  </p>\n<p>As Hemingway said, “Never regretted anything I ever did. Only regret things I didn’t do.”</p>\n<div id=\"pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg\"></div>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/a-lesson-from-ernest-hemingway-in-why-you-should-plan-your-weekends/\">A Lesson From Ernest Hemingway in Why You Should Plan Your Weekends</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com\">The Art of Manliness</a>.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/theartofmanliness/~4/AHksHLkDljc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 23 May 2021 12:37:22 +0000","feedId":13,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"c2064459da969259d6d212467701335b","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Brett and Kate McKay","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2018/07/Hemingway-Leisure-header.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn95@2020_5/2021/05/25/17-47-54-256_240f71a52953f226.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/theartofmanliness/~4/AHksHLkDljc":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn16@2020_6/2021/05/25/17-47-54-220_57c171a0b485c323.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1621964860786},{"createdTime":"2021-05-26 01:47:40","updatedTime":"2021-05-26 01:47:40","title":"9 Ways to Start a Fire Without Matches","link":"http://artofmanliness.com/?p=173","description":"<h4 id=\"pressboard-ad-sponsorship-tag\" style=\"margin-bottom: 35px;\"></h4><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-135875\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2008/04/hanks.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2008/04/hanks.png 750w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2008/04/hanks-320x179.png 320w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2008/04/hanks-640x358.png 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\"></img></p>\n<p><em>With our archives now 3,500+ articles deep, we’ve decided to republish a classic piece each Sunday to help our newer readers discover some of the best, evergreen gems from the past. This article was originally published in April 2008.</em></p>\n<p>Whether for warmth, cooking, or signaling, fire is a survival essential. As is the knowledge of how to make one without matches. You never know when you’ll find yourself without those convenient little red-tipped tools. Maybe your single engine plane goes down while you’re flying over the Alaskan wilderness, like the kid in <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2RRdz9K\"><em>Hatchet</em></a>. Or perhaps you’re out camping and you lose your backpack in <a title=\"How to Survive a Bear Attack: An Illustrated Guide\" href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-survive-a-bear-attack-visual-guide/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a tussle with a bear</a>. It needn’t even be something so dramatic — even extremely windy or wet conditions can render matches virtually useless.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, if you need to make fire and don’t have matches, you’re not at all out of luck; a wide variety of other options remain for catalyzing a flame.  Below, we go over nine of them, from those which utilize items you might scrounge in an urban environment to ones which only require the natural leavings of the wilderness. </p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Friction-Based Fire Making</strong></span></h3>\n<p>Friction-based fire making is not for the faint of heart, and represents the most difficult of the non-match methods. There are different techniques you can use to make a fire with friction, but the most important aspect is the type of wood you use for the fireboard and spindle.</p>\n<p>The spindle is the stick you’ll spin in order to create friction between it and the fireboard. If you create enough friction between the spindle and the fireboard, you can create an ember that can be used to create a fire. Cottonwood, juniper, aspen, willow, cedar, cypress, and walnut make the best fireboard and spindle sets.</p>\n<p>Before you can use wood to start a friction-based fire, the wood must be bone dry. If the wood isn’t dry, you’ll have to dry it out first.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/traditional-firestarting-part-ii-fire-from-friction/#handdrill\"><strong>1. The Hand Drill</strong></a></h3>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-135873\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2008/04/fire.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2008/04/fire.jpg 594w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2008/04/fire-320x237.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px\"></img></p>\n<p>The hand drill method is the most primeval, and the most difficult to do. All you need is wood, tireless hands, and some gritty determination. Here’s how it’s done:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/make-tinder-bundle/\"><strong>Build a tinder nest</strong></a>. Your tinder nest will be used to turn the ember you create into a flame. Make a tinder nest out of anything that catches fire easily, like dry grass, leaves, and bark.</p>\n<p><strong>Make your notch.</strong> Cut a v-shaped notch into your fireboard and make a small depression adjacent to it.</p>\n<p><strong>Place bark underneath the notch.</strong> The bark will be used to catch an ember from the friction between the spindle and fireboard.</p>\n<p><strong>Start spinning.</strong> Place the spindle into the depression on your fireboard. Your spindle should be about 2 feet long for this to work properly. Maintain pressure on the board and start rolling the spindle between your hands, running them quickly down the spindle. Keep doing this until an ember is formed on the fireboard.</p>\n<p><strong>Start a fire!</strong> Once you see a glowing ember, tap the fireboard to drop your ember onto the piece of bark. Transfer the bark to your nest of tinder. Gently blow on it to start your flame.</p>\n<h3><strong>2. Fire Plough</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Prepare your fireboard</strong>. Cut a groove in the fireboard. This will be your track for the spindle.</p>\n<p><strong>Rub!</strong> Take the tip of your spindle and place it in the groove of your fireboard. Start rubbing the tip of the spindle up and down the groove.</p>\n<p><strong>Start a fire.</strong> Have your tinder nest at the end of the fireboard, so that you’ll plow embers into as you’re rubbing. Once you catch one, blow the nest gently and get that fire going.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/traditional-firestarting-part-ii-fire-from-friction/\"><strong>3. Bow Drill</strong></a></h3>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-135878\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2008/04/bow.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2008/04/bow.jpg 650w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2008/04/bow-320x214.jpg 320w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2008/04/bow-640x427.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\"></img></p>\n<p>The bow drill is probably the most effective friction-based method to use because it’s easier to maintain the speed and pressure you need to create enough friction to start a fire. In addition to the spindle and fireboard, you’ll also need a socket and a bow.</p>\n<p><strong>Get a socket.</strong> The socket is used to put pressure on the other end of the spindle as you’re rotating it with the bow. The socket can be a stone or another piece of wood. If you use another piece of wood, try to find a harder piece than what you’re using for the spindle. Wood with sap and oil is good as it creates a lubricant between the spindle and the socket.</p>\n<p><strong>Make your bow.</strong> The bow should be about as long as your arm. Use a flexible piece of wood that has a slight curve. The string of the bow can be anything: a shoelace, rope, strip of rawhide, etc. Just find something that won’t break. String up your bow and you’re ready to go.</p>\n<p><strong>Prepare the fireboard.</strong> Cut a v-shaped notch and create a depression adjacent to it in the fireboard. Underneath the notch, place your tinder.</p>\n<p><strong>String up the spindle.</strong> Catch the spindle in a loop of the bow string. Place one end of the spindle in the fireboard and apply pressure on the other end with your socket.</p>\n<p><strong>Start sawing</strong>. Using your bow, start sawing back and forth. You’ve basically created a rudimentary mechanical drill. The spindle should be rotating quickly. Keep sawing until you create an ember.</p>\n<p><strong>Make your fire.</strong> Drop the ember into the tinder nest and blow on it gently. You’ve got yourself a fire.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/traditional-firestarting-part-i-how-to-make-fire-with-flint-and-steel/\"><strong>4. Flint and Steel</strong></a></h3>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-135877\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2008/04/steel-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2008/04/steel-1.jpg 650w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2008/04/steel-1-320x214.jpg 320w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2008/04/steel-1-640x427.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\"></img></p>\n<p>This is an old standby. It’s always a good idea to carry around <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3uEFJTP\">a good flint and steel set</a> with you on a camping trip. Matches can get wet and be become pretty much useless, but you can still get a spark from putting steel to a good piece of flint.</p>\n<p>If you’re caught without a flint and steel set, you can always improvise by using quartzite and the steel blade of your pocketknife (you are <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/every-man-should-carry-a-pocket-knife/\">carrying your pocketknife</a>, aren’t you?). You’ll also need char cloth. <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/the-ultimate-firestarter-how-to-make-char-cloth/\">Char cloth is cloth that has been turned into charcoal</a>. It catches a spark and keeps it smoldering without bursting into flames. If you don’t have char cloth, a piece of fungus or birch will do.</p>\n<p><strong>Grip the rock and char cloth.</strong> Take hold of the piece of rock between your thumb and forefinger. Make sure an edge is hanging out about 2 or 3 inches. Grasp the char between your thumb and the flint.</p>\n<p><strong>Strike!</strong> Grasp the back of the steel striker or use the back of your knife blade. Strike the steel against the flint several times. Sparks from the steel will fly off and land on the char cloth, causing a glow.</p>\n<p><strong>Start a fire.</strong> Fold up your char cloth into a tinder nest and gently blow on it to start a flame.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Lens-Based Methods</strong></span></h3>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-135879 aligncenter\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2008/04/lens.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2008/04/lens.jpg 650w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2008/04/lens-320x214.jpg 320w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2008/04/lens-640x427.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\"></img></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Using a lens to start a fire is an easy matchless method. Any boy who has melted green plastic army men with a magnifying glass will know how to do it. If you have by chance never melted green plastic army men, here’s the technique.</p>\n<h3><strong>5. Traditional Lenses</strong></h3>\n<p>To create a fire, all you need is some sort of lens in order to focus sunlight on a specific spot. A magnifying glass, eyeglasses, or binocular lenses all work. If you add some water to the lens, you can intensify the beam. Angle the lens towards the sun in order to focus the beam into as small an area as possible. Put your tinder nest under this spot and you’ll soon have yourself a fire.</p>\n<p>The only drawback to the lens-based method is that it only works when you have sun. So if it’s nighttime or overcast, you won’t have any luck.</p>\n<p>In addition to the typical lens method, there are three odd, but effective, lens-based methods to start a fire as well.</p>\n<h3><strong>6. Balloons and Condoms</strong></h3>\n<p>By filling a balloon or condom with water, you can transform these ordinary objects into fire-creating lenses.</p>\n<p>Fill the condom or balloon with water and tie off the end. You’ll want to make it as spherical as possible. Don’t make the inflated balloon or condom too big or it will distort the sunlight’s focal point. Squeeze the balloon to find a shape that gives you a sharp circle of light. Try squeezing the condom in the middle to form two smaller lenses.</p>\n<p>Condoms and balloons both have a shorter focal length than an ordinary lens. Hold them 1 to 2 inches from your tinder.</p>\n<h3><strong>7. Fire From Ice</strong></h3>\n<p>Fire from ice isn’t just some dumb cliché used for high school prom themes. You can actually make fire from a piece of ice. All you need to do is form the ice into a lens shape and then use it as you would when starting a fire with any other lens. This method can be particularly handy for wintertime camping.</p>\n<p><strong>Get clear water</strong>. For this to work, the ice must be clear. If it’s cloudy or has other impurities, it’s not going to work. The best way to get a clear ice block is to fill up a bowl, cup, or a container made out of foil with clear lake or pond water or melted snow. Let it freeze until it forms ice. Your block should be about 2 inches thick for this to work.</p>\n<p><strong>Form your lens.</strong> Use your knife to shape the ice into a lens. Remember a lens shape is thicker in the middle and narrower near the edges.</p>\n<p><strong>Polish your lens.</strong> After you get the rough shape of a lens, finish the shaping of it by polishing it with your hands. The heat from your hands will melt the ice enough so you get a nice smooth surface.</p>\n<p><strong>Start a fire.</strong> Angle your ice lens towards the sun just as you would any other lens. Focus the light on your tinder nest and watch as you make a once stupid cliché come to life.</p>\n<h3><strong>8. Soda Can and Chocolate Bar</strong></h3>\n<p>A weird one that’s just cool to know.</p>\n<p><strong>Polish the bottom of the soda can with the chocolate.</strong> Open up your bar of chocolate and start rubbing it on the bottom of the soda can. The chocolate acts as a polish and will make the bottom of the can shine like a mirror. If you don’t have chocolate with you, toothpaste also works.</p>\n<p><strong>Make your fire.</strong> After polishing the bottom of your can, what you have is essentially a parabolic mirror. Sunlight will reflect off the bottom of the can, forming a single focal point. It’s kind of like how a mirror telescope works.</p>\n<p>Point the bottom of the can towards the sun. You’ll have created a highly focused ray of light aimed directly at your tinder. Place the tinder about an inch from the reflecting light’s focal point. In a few seconds you should have a flame.</p>\n<h3><strong>9. Batteries and Steel Wool</strong></h3>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-135894\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2008/04/steelwool-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2008/04/steelwool-1.jpg 650w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2008/04/steelwool-1-372x230.jpg 372w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2008/04/steelwool-1-320x198.jpg 320w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2008/04/steelwool-1-640x397.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\"></img></p>\n<p>This one is quite easy and is fun to try at home, especially with kids. </p>\n<p><strong>Stretch out the steel wool.</strong> You want it to be about 6 inches long and a ½-inch wide.</p>\n<p><strong>Rub the battery on the steel wool.</strong> Hold the steel wool in one hand and the battery in the other. Any battery will do, but 9-volt batteries work best. Rub the side of the battery with the “contacts” on the wool. The wool will begin to glow and burn. Gently blow on it.</p>\n<p><strong>Transfer the burning wool to your tinder nest.</strong> The wool’s flame will extinguish quickly, so don’t waste any time.</p>\n<div id=\"pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg\"></div>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/9-ways-to-start-a-fire-without-matches/\">9 Ways to Start a Fire Without Matches</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com\">The Art of Manliness</a>.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/theartofmanliness/~4/ozVJSTmjcmY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 16 May 2021 12:57:06 +0000","feedId":13,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"451941de4540f6bc7c886590a1ce7a5c","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Brett &#38; Kate McKay","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2008/04/hanks.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn59@2020_6/2021/05/25/17-47-55-526_9338d52982a3633b.webp","https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2008/04/fire.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn22@2020_2/2021/05/25/17-47-54-286_5203dc7c4c98082a.webp","https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2008/04/bow.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn51@2020_3/2021/05/25/17-47-54-265_a7177ac4175e7f45.webp","https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2008/04/steel-1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn68@2020_5/2021/05/25/17-47-54-188_8e12fca4355b4bb4.webp","https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2008/04/lens.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn92@2020_5/2021/05/25/17-47-56-244_d4462a1cf74318bc.webp","https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2008/04/steelwool-1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn55@2020_3/2021/05/25/17-47-54-278_8495a411f2a01b0d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/theartofmanliness/~4/ozVJSTmjcmY":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn72@2020_3/2021/05/25/17-47-54-256_ff8c7a8fedefead0.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1621964860786},{"createdTime":"2021-05-26 01:47:40","updatedTime":"2021-05-26 01:47:40","title":"How to Effectively Dry Wet Shoes","link":"https://www.artofmanliness.com/?p=135928","description":"<h4 id=\"pressboard-ad-sponsorship-tag\" style=\"margin-bottom: 35px;\"></h4><div><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-136008\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/05/Wet-Shoes-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/05/Wet-Shoes-1.jpg 750w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/05/Wet-Shoes-1-320x187.jpg 320w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/05/Wet-Shoes-1-640x374.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\"></img></div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>Whether you step into a puddle while walking, get pushed fully-clothed into a pool while partying, or slip in a stream while hiking, you’ll need to dry out your shoes — and often do so fairly quickly, having to wear the same pair the next day. Wet shoes are uncomfortable to wear, and can start to stink as well.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>If you’re in the wilds, <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-dry-wet-boots-with-hot-rocks/\">you can dry your boots out using hot rocks</a>. Back home, you may be tempted to throw your shoes in the dryer or place them by the furnace. But while this may work okay for some kinds of shoes, it’s not recommended, as direct heat can damage your footwear.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>To dry your shoes gently, yet effectively, the technique outlined above is best. (Note that you should only remove the insoles if they’re removable.)</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>If your shoes are very saturated with water, start by pressing a towel on the outside fabric, and then insert it inside and compress the shoe with your hands to soak up excess water. Then proceed to stuff the shoes with balled-up pieces of newspaper. If you don’t get a traditional newspaper, the newspaper-esque flyers and advertisements that arrive in your mailbox and on your driveway can work, though “drier,” more absorbent papers work better than glossier sheets, and papers with lots of ink run the chance of leaking onto lighter-colored shoes. If you don’t have newspaper of any kind, balls of paper towels will work, though you need to put more of them in to get sufficient “firmness” with your stuffing; you need to create ample contact surface between the paper and the shoe for the former to draw the water out of the latter.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>\n<p>Depending on how soaked your shoes are, and how often you change out the paper balls, your shoes can be completely dry in eight hours or so. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.storytellersworkshop.com\"><em>Illustrated by Ted Slampyak</em></a></p>\n</div>\n<div id=\"pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg\"></div>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-effectively-dry-wet-shoes/\">How to Effectively Dry Wet Shoes</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com\">The Art of Manliness</a>.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/theartofmanliness/~4/hiel_VwKDv8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 25 May 2021 15:53:36 +0000","feedId":13,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"befd840b2c92ae7931fd370ddbf7ca47","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Brett &#38; Kate McKay","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/05/Wet-Shoes-1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn100@2020_2/2021/05/25/17-47-56-278_08ebd44a55353cc1.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/theartofmanliness/~4/hiel_VwKDv8":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn36@2020_5/2021/05/25/17-47-56-223_72ef296fe5fb7c20.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1621964860786},{"createdTime":"2021-05-26 01:47:40","updatedTime":"2021-05-26 01:47:40","title":"5 Great Podcasts for Kids (That Are Enjoyable for Parents Too!)","link":"https://www.artofmanliness.com/?p=135917","description":"<h4 id=\"pressboard-ad-sponsorship-tag\" style=\"margin-bottom: 35px;\"></h4><p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-135924\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/05/podcast_for_kids_header-copy.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/05/podcast_for_kids_header-copy.jpg 650w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/05/podcast_for_kids_header-copy-372x230.jpg 372w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/05/podcast_for_kids_header-copy-320x197.jpg 320w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/05/podcast_for_kids_header-copy-640x394.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\"></img></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You’re cruising along with your family on a summer road trip and everyone is getting a little cranky. The air is stale, the drinks are stale too, and what’s needed is some sort of activity that everyone can agree on. Sure, each kid/parent could have their own device to waste away the hours, but it’s more fun to be able to engage with something together. That way the diversion can move from segregated consumption to common conversation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Landing on this shared entertainment is a tall task. Music is fine, but doesn’t pass the time very well, and it’s hard to get everyone to concur on a genre or station (Kidz Bop makes Mom and Dad want to gouge their eyes out). Playing various car-based games (20 questions, find all 50 license plates, ABC game, etc.) can be fun, but what to do when you’ve already cycled through them? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why not try a kid-oriented podcast? Along with the proliferation of podcasts for adults in recent years, the Kids and Family category has grown by leaps and bounds as well and can keep everyone entertained for extended periods of time (or simply on your daily commute to school). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The key, and the hard part, is selecting something that the kids will find engaging, and Mom and Dad will find tolerable, and ideally even enjoyable.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With that curation criteria in mind, I listened to a ton of podcasts with my almost-six-year-old son, and together we decided on some top picks: The shows featured below are kid- and adult-tested, kid- and adult-approved. Most shows here are geared towards somewhat younger audiences — starting at about age five (which seems to be when kids can begin to follow an audio story) and going through the preteen years. Once your children turn into teenagers, all bets are off and you might start delving into non-kid programming. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Almost all of these podcast hosts and creators have been in the audio production game for a long time. When you’re making something for kids, there needs to be that balanced constellation of traits: educational, entertaining, appropriate, and engaging (for just the right amount of time), typically with at least a little humor peppered in. It’s not easy to get it just right. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the following hit that sweet spot nicely, there are still many dozens of great options out there for kids’ podcasts; this list is but a jumping off point if you’re unsure of where to start. As with anything your children consume, it’s best to listen to an episode or two yourself to see if the tone and content match your family’s values, interests, and sensibilities. </span></p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.whatifworldpodcast.com/\"><i>What If World</i></a><i> </i></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are a lot of storytelling podcasts out there. My favorite is </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What If World</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. What If World is a separate planet where anything can happen. Taking ridiculous questions from kids themselves — the more outlandish the better — Mr. Eric (aka creator Eric O’Keeffe) spins answers into a rollicking, often funny story that’s entertaining for kids and adults alike. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What if parents went to school and kids went to work? What if puppies had laser eyes and could fly? What if unicorns and cars morphed together? What if every closet had a skeleton in it? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are these questions absurd? Of course. Are they perfect fodder for storytelling? Yes! </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What’s great about Mr. Eric, and what sets </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What If World</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> apart from other storytelling shows, are the great sound effects and voices he creates for his characters. (JFKat, for instance, is a hilarious recurring cat character.) Though not part of the episodes themselves, Mr. Eric provides a take-home lesson on each episode’s webpage, which makes a handy jumping off point for further conversations with your kiddos. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This show will also help your own storytelling chops as a parent — have your kids ask the silliest “what if” question they can conjure up and weave your own tale! </span></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://tinkercast.com/shows/wow-in-the-world/\"><i>Wow in the World</i></a></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you listen to any of NPR’s numerous podcasts, you’ve likely heard this one advertised. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wow in the World</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is hosted by Guy Raz (who also hosts </span><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510313/how-i-built-this\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How I Built This</span></i></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">) and Mindy Thomas. Given that it’s an NPR show, the production value is among the best you’ll find in a kids’ show. The sound effects, funny dialogue, and science/technology explanations are top-notch. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Weekly episodes explore some sort of idea or discovery in the STEM realm — sea shells, the whitest paint ever, how the brain registers pain. You get the idea. Each episode also provides a “WOW-sheet,” which is a printable activity that brings kids from the audio world to the real world. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Included in the feed for this show is a weekly episode of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two Whats?! and a Wow!</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which is a short quiz show that was created in response to the school closures of the last year. It’s interactive and very fun. There are also special weeks/episodes focused on a “tinker” project, which gives kids a short prompt for creating something at home and submitting their pictures/experiences to the hosts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In short, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wow in the World</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a kids’ show with a lot of variety and is far more interactive than most. Sometimes the potty humor is a little much (there are </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a lot</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of jokes about farts), but every episode is entertaining for kids and adults alike. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be sure to take advantage of </span><a href=\"https://tinkercast.com/listen?m_page=1&#38;m_search=\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the categorized database of shows</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which breaks them down by appropriate age level and topic. There are </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">hundreds</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of episodes in the archives, so this is a rather useful tool. </span></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.smashboom.org/\"><i>Smash Boom Best</i></a><i> </i></h3>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smash Boom Best </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">might just be the most fun show on this list. Geared towards kids </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> their families, it’s a simple debate show which argues the merits between two things: Bats vs owls. Castles vs caves. Invisibility vs flying. Mermaids vs bigfoot. Avengers vs Star Wars. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each episode features main host Molly Bloom, alongside a rotating cast of guests who serve as the two debaters, as well as the judge who decides a winner between them. Chefs, comedians, authors — they bring in a wide variety of fun, energetic people who get very passionate about the topic at hand. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are a few rounds of different styles of debate. The Declaration of Greatness sums up the history and awesomeness of the subject (followed by 30-second rebuttals). Then there’s a Micro Round, which is some sort of short, creative challenge that the debaters have prepared in advance — a persuasive sonnet, an exciting movie trailer, a letter to the editor, etc. After that is the Sneak Attack, in which they have to do basically the same thing, but without something pre-prepared. It ends with the Final Six, which requires debaters to sum up their argument in just six words. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beyond just the silly arguments, they get into real tips about debating, rebuttals, persuasiveness, and even logical fallacies! </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are a few dozen episodes, averaging about 35 minutes long (there are extra episodes for paid supporters). So they’re a little longer than your standard kids’ show, but since the intent is for this to spur conversation/debate among children and their parents (and anyone else tagging along!), it’s not too hard keeping everyone on track, especially when broken into a couple listening sessions. </span></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://thepastandthecurious.com/\"><i>The Past and the Curious</i></a></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For history-loving kiddos out there, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Past and the Curious</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a great show which presents dramatic first-person accounts of history’s unusual and unknown tales, featuring famous and not-so-famous names alike.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each episode is about 30 minutes long and features two stories around a theme: Women in flight, bears, “Great Moments in Communication!”, etc. The heavily researched, engaging stories are well-produced, often a little comedic/sarcastic, and provide great context as to why these narratives matter. That might sound a little heady, but my kiddo loves it and can often recite back to me an episode recap even a week or two after listening. Yes, the kid has a good memory, but it also shows how memorable the stories can be. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recent episode subjects include astronomer George Ellery Hale and the world’s largest telescope, Levi Strauss and his blue jeans, Willa Brown (the first black woman to earn a pilot’s license), the great limburger cheese war of 1935, and more. Even as an adult, you probably aren’t familiar with most of the stories and you’re guaranteed to learn something from each episode. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New episodes come out monthly and there are 50+ in the archives to sate your appetite between installments. </span></p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.finncaspian.com/\"><i>The Alien Adventures of Finn Caspian</i></a><b><i> </i></b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’re looking for a fictional story with recurring characters, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finn Caspian</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a great sci-fi adventure show. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finn is an 8-year-old boy aboard an interplanetary space station. He and his friends are part of an “Explorers Troop,” sort of a space version of the Scouts. They explore planets, encounter aliens, and solve mysteries together. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s no violence and just a little bit of suspense in this show that describes itself as “</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scooby-Doo</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> meets </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in space.” The host does all the voices, which gives it a little bit of a homemade feel, but John Messinger does a great job describing what you’re “seeing” as you listen. The sound effects are quite good, too.

If that’s you, my guests have some great tips for planning and executing an awesome road trip. Their names are Jeremy and Stephanie Puglisi and they’re the proprietors of the <a href=\"https://thervatlas.com/\">RV Atlas blog and podcast</a>, the authors of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1728221692/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=1728221692&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess&#38;linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\">several books</a> on camping and road tripping, and veteran road trippers themselves, having, together with their three boys, spent over a thousand nights at hundreds of campgrounds from coast to coast. </p>\n<p>We start off our conversation with how the Puglisis began road tripping with a pop-up camper, and the benefits of driving places rather than flying. We then get into how to dip your toes into RVing without a big commitment, and whether there’s an ideal age to start taking RV trips with your kids. From there we get into best practices for planning and executing a road trip, whether you’re going by RV or car, including the biggest mistakes people make, the art of road trip snacks, and when it’s better to fly versus drive. We also talk about how to keep kids entertained on the road, including how to handle the issue of screen time. We end our conversation with the benefits of staying at campsites rather than hotels, why you might want to look into private KOA campgrounds, and why planning a great road trip always starts with picking a great destination.<br></br><em><br></br>\nIf reading this in an email, click the title of the post to listen to the show.</em></p>\n<h3>Show Highlights</h3>\n<ul><li>How the Puglisis got into road-tripping with their family </li>\n<li>Their progression of campers and RVs</li>\n<li>The benefits of road-tripping vs. flying </li>\n<li>Advice for people who want to test the RV waters </li>\n<li>Is there a perfect age for starting kids on the road trip habit?</li>\n<li>The “startup” costs for renting/buying an RV</li>\n<li>What are the biggest mistakes people make when planning/executing road trips </li>\n<li>Is there an ideal length of road trip?</li>\n<li>What about kids and screens on the road?</li>\n<li>How to find and choose a campground </li>\n<li>The community you can find at campgrounds </li>\n</ul><h3>Resources/Articles/People Mentioned in Podcast</h3>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1492694657/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=1492694657&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess&#38;linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\"><em>See You at the Campground</em></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/podcast-437-dont-make-me-pull-over-a-history-of-the-road-trip/\">Don’t Make Me Pull Over!
