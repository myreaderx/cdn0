What is this thing working from anywhere? Or as Google says, work from right here in the office. As the vaccines roll on out, some of us are just not ready for returning to normal. On this edition of the Gillmor Gang, the office is a state of mind, served up by Zoom and Clubhouse. It sounds like Clownhouse, with unlimited fungible bozos on the menu.</p>\n<p>Surely we are binged out, election recalled, floating in a vat of VC alphabet soup. SPACs are everywhere and nowhere, water cooled conversations masquerading as big ticket conferences, right wing looneys seeking blanket pardons. And we&#8217;re applying for permission to stay home in our digital workshops? Yes, it will probably work for a hot second, but when will the research measure what has really changed. After a year of living a nightmare, some of us are ready for anything but the rest of our lives.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>The other day on Clubhouse, they celebrated the life and times of Hal Willner, a record producer extraordinaire who died suddenly of COVID at 64. My Gang colleague Michael Markman sent me a Clubhouse notification suggesting I might want to listen in, and I did. I knew Hal a little bit, worked with him on several of his projects, and made the mistake we all make too often of assuming he or she would be around for the duration. So I clicked on the link and found myself in a room full of people who knew him a whole lot better. It was cathartic to hear them try and describe the guy, his life&#8217;s work, his day job at Saturday Night Live, and his magical series of projects pairing the strangest combinations of artists you could not even imagine. But he did.</p>\n<p>So when we start to figure out this new world we&#8217;ve been propelled into, the normal we are fashioning out of the hints the virus has left us about what&#8217;s important, we all knew Willner and the mischievous glint in his eye just enough to wish for just a little more help in the now. His friends were on surer footing in this crazy clubhouse, chiming in from literally all over the world. Some saw him as a mentor, others as a collaborator, me with the twinge of regret for not being remotely brave enough to appreciate the brief window into this gentle giant for the luck of the encounter. I knew he was special, I knew it didn&#8217;t matter how or why we all got there at some time, and here was Clubhouse serving up a human experience only possible because people like Hal seized these moments of the days going by.</p>\n<p>Yet it&#8217;s easy to say these new constructs are built like a house of cards, that the hype will fade, the economics atrophy, the big get bigger. It may all be true, but what part of the really big idea Clubhouse or Medium or Substack is truly vulnerable? There is where it becomes political posturing as much as anything. Just because the current or pivoted business model is suspect doesn&#8217;t mean success isn&#8217;t lurking just around the corner. If the world is suddenly toxic, does that preclude the idea that adjusting to the emergency can produce new realities that can improve on the nature of conventional reality?</p>\n<p>Take Medium for a second. The writing platform announced a blogging flashback, blogrolls, as a new feature to amplify signals of affection for favorite authors. The Medium analytics are harnessed to project an organically-updating list of favorite follows informed by recent updates by the authors. For the readers, this is a convenient hybrid of social and feeds; for the writers an incentive to gain timely traction in the community of what on Twitter we call the social cloud. It is simple in execution but deep in purpose, as it encourages you to post to Medium. The platform has recently pivoted away from funding original content after pivoting away from eyeball-driven advertising, but this new feature could be a way of letting the existing architecture fund the growth of strategic analytics. The more you deliver signal to the follow notification stream, the more you prime the pump of handclaps and time to click metrics, which increases the strength of the blogroll signal and so it goes.</p>\n<p>You may ask yourself, what does this have to do with working from anywhere? Well, the idea you can nurture a self-healing community of co-workers through digital technologies is right at the top of the list of things we want to do to bolster the new economy. While audio is seen as subtractive from video, it is additive in terms of broadening the user base beyond so-called creators to the so-called doers, the folks who move the products and services from place to place. It&#8217;s radio, a companion stream of news, music, soap box, ideas, alerts, reminders, and coffee breaks that fuels the day and lights the night. It&#8217;s digital mom and pop.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong><em>from the <a href=\"https://www.getrevue.co/profile/gillmorgang/issues/gillmor-gang-newsletter-revue-5-514665\"> Gillmor Gang Newsletter</a></em></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">__________________</p>\n<p>The Gillmor Gang — Frank Radice, Michael Markman, Keith Teare, Denis Pombriant, Brent Leary and Steve Gillmor.

Nestor originally started with a simple idea to differentiate itself from food delivery giants, such as Deliveroo, Uber Eats and others.</p>\n<p>Every day, the startup offered a single menu for lunch. If you liked what was on the menu, you could order and get delivered 10 to 20 minutes later. By offering a single menu, a delivery person could deliver several clients in a single ride. Similarly, by managing its own kitchen, Nestor could improve its margins as it didn’t have to pay third-party restaurants.</p>\n<p>Since I first covered Nestor <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/30/nestor-focuses-on-delivering-lunch-for-office-workers-in-paris/\">in 2016</a>, the company has been capital efficient and mostly focused on this unique product offering. Elior says that Nestor managed to reach 10,000 meals per week.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>Over the past few months, Nestor has tried to launch new offers. For instance, companies can switch to Nestor for their canteens. The startup delivers meals in fridges directly. It reminds me of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/11/foodles-raises-another-10-million-for-its-cloud-canteen/\">Foodles</a>, another French startup focused on canteen-like services.</p>\n<p>Nestor can also deliver individually packed lunches in case you are spending the day with some clients for a big meeting. <a href=\"https://popchef.com\">Popchef</a> has also pivoted to focus more on that segment.</p>\n<p>Following the acquisition, Nestor is going to focus more and more on the B2B market. While Elior is working with big companies in glass towers, it has been quite hard to convince small and medium companies to open a canteen in the office.</p>\n<p>The sales pitch could be summed up in two sentences. Nestor clients don’t need to have their own kitchen as everything is prepared in advance. And employees don’t have to browse Deliveroo at lunch time to find something that isn’t a burger or a pizza.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\"

announcements, with fresh and unexpected news hailing from Natasha&#8217;s home state, New Jersey.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what we got into:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Box got a lifeline in the form of a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/kkr-hands-box-a-500m-lifeline/\">$500 million check from KKR</a>, and as Danny mentions, Box CEO Aaron Levie shifts his role a bit, too.</li>\n<li>Patreon, an early startup in the creator economy space, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/patreon-triples-valuation-to-4-billion/\">has tripled its valuation to $4 billion.</a> Another, not-so-old

Rather I think we will find a happy medium that incorporates fast growth and sustainability.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/tag/austin\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2136374\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/austin-footer-banner.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"141\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/austin-footer-banner.jpg 3200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/austin-footer-banner.jpg?resize=150,21 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/austin-footer-banner.jpg?resize=300,41 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/austin-footer-banner.jpg?resize=768,106 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/austin-footer-banner.jpg?resize=680,94 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/austin-footer-banner.jpg?resize=1536,211 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/austin-footer-banner.jpg?resize=2048,282 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/austin-footer-banner.jpg?resize=50,7 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=9qKVis1VgbU:sBHj-JIuuT4:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=9qKVis1VgbU:sBHj-JIuuT4:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=9qKVis1VgbU:sBHj-JIuuT4:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=9qKVis1VgbU:sBHj-JIuuT4:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=9qKVis1VgbU:sBHj-JIuuT4:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=9qKVis1VgbU:sBHj-JIuuT4:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=9qKVis1VgbU:sBHj-JIuuT4:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=9qKVis1VgbU:sBHj-JIuuT4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/9qKVis1VgbU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 09 Apr 2021 13:36:43 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/austin-footer-banner.jpg","linkMd5":"7156ea1738c1792670c81b7c41ce508c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn4@2020_1/2021/04/09/16-42-20-060_32b95dd1a90de01e.webp","destWidth":3200,"destHeight":440,"sourceBytes":426579,"destBytes":110676,"author":"Mary Ann Azevedo","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/austin-footer-banner.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn4@2020_1/2021/04/09/16-42-20-060_32b95dd1a90de01e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn35@2020_3/2021/04/09/16-41-36-205_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn47@2020_5/2021/04/09/16-42-25-878_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn4@2020_1/2021/04/09/16-42-25-351_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=9qKVis1VgbU:sBHj-JIuuT4:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn79@2020_5/2021/04/09/16-42-25-333_a1efe2d5e33bba3f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=9qKVis1VgbU:sBHj-JIuuT4:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn39@2020_3/2021/04/09/16-42-25-342_f746d5b5cc420587.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn67@2020_3/2021/04/09/16-42-25-759_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/9qKVis1VgbU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn36@2020_4/2021/04/09/16-42-25-791_dc1700c2eea4230c.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617986496016},{"createdTime":"2021-04-10 00:41:35","updatedTime":"2021-04-10 00:41:35","title":"So you want to raise a Series A","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2134119","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">During a seed funding round, a founder needs to convince a venture capital investor on a vision.

Moore explained that startups looking to move to their next round need to explain to investors why now is their moment.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The way I think about “why now” is [that] it is an opportunity for you as a founder to convey a unique insight and understanding of your market opportunity, the history of the space that you&#8217;re in, why companies have succeeded or failed in that space, historically speaking, and what are the known challenges from a go-to-market perspective; what headwinds will you be up against at a macro level.

More than half of the 3,215 votes cast broke in in factor of the retailer. The Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, which would have served as the workers&#8217; union, had the vote passed, was quick to challenge the results.</p>\n<p>RWDSU President Stuart Appelbaum said in a statement offered to TechCrunch,</p>\n<blockquote><p>Amazon has left no stone unturned in its efforts to gaslight its own employees. We won’t let Amazon’s lies, deception and illegal activities go unchallenged, which is why we are formally filing charges against all of the egregious and blatantly illegal actions taken by Amazon during the union vote. Amazon knew full well that unless they did everything they possibly could, even illegal activity, their workers would have continued supporting the union.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>That’s why they required all their employees to attend lecture after lecture, filled with mistruths and lies, where workers had to listen to the company demand they oppose the union. That’s why they flooded the internet, the airwaves and social media with ads spreading misinformation. That’s why they brought in dozens of outsiders and union-busters to walk the floor of the warehouse. That’s why they bombarded people with signs throughout the facility and with text messages and calls at home. And that’s why they have been lying about union dues in a right to work state. Amazon’s conduct has been despicable.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This initial defeat represents a large setback in the biggest unionization push in Amazon’s 27 year history. What might have represented a sea change for both the retail giant and blue collar tech workers has, for now, been fairly soundly defeated.</p>\n<p>Amazon has, of course, long insisted that it treats workers fairly, making such union efforts unnecessary. The company cites such standards as a $15 an hour minimum wage, a factor the company initial pushed back on, but ultimately instated after pressure from legislators.</p>\n<p>It was a hard fought battle on both sides. A number of legislators threw their weight behind unionization efforts, in an unlikely alliance that ranged from Bernie Sanders to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/12/marco-rubio-says-he-stands-with-amazon-warehouse-workers/\">Marco Rubio</a>. The conservative Florida Senator noted the company&#8217;s “uniquely malicious corporate behavior.” President Joe Biden also sided with the workers, calling himself, “the most pro-union president you’ve ever seen.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The company will no doubt tout the results as vindication. It noted in an early statement, &#8220;[O]ur employees are smart and know the truth—starting wages of $15 or more, health care from day one, and a safe and inclusive workplace. We encourage all of our employees to vote.” We&#8217;ve reached out to the company for a statement following this morning&#8217;s news.</p>\n<p>Among the expected challenges from the union are lingering questions around ballot boxes reportedly installed by the company in violation of labor board terms.&#8221;[E]ven though the NLRB definitively denied Amazon&#8217;s request for a drop box on the warehouse property, Amazon felt it was above the law and worked with the postal service anyway to install one,&#8221; the RWDSU writes. &#8220;They did this because it provided a clear ability to intimidate workers.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The Bessemer warehouse, which employees around 6,000 workers, was opened at the end of March 2020, as the company looked to expand the operation of its essential workers during the impending lock down. The conversation has surface variously long standing complaints around the company&#8217;s treatment of blue collar workers, including numerous reports that employees urinate in water bottles, in order to meet stringent performance standards.</p>\n<p>The company initially denied these claims during a social media offensive, but later clarified its stance in an apology of sorts, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/03/amazon-addresses-pee-bottle-denial-tweet/\">appearing to shift the blame</a> to wider industry problems. The company also ran anti-union ads on its subsidiary, Twitch, before the streaming platform pulled them, stating that they &#8220;should never have been allowed to run.&#8221;</p>\n<p>All told, 3,215 were cast, representing more than half of the workers at the Alabama warehouse. In spite of Amazon winning more than half the votes, counting will continue. Challenges are likely to stretch on for weeks.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"qgjL4q7Nla\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/amazon-goes-on-the-offensive-ahead-of-next-weeks-union-vote-counting/\">Amazon goes on the offensive ahead of next week’s union vote counting</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Amazon goes on the offensive ahead of next week’s union vote counting&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/amazon-goes-on-the-offensive-ahead-of-next-weeks-union-vote-counting/embed/#?secret=qgjL4q7Nla\" data-secret=\"qgjL4q7Nla\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=yeB3ptpiZzg:7e3BKd63eME:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=yeB3ptpiZzg:7e3BKd63eME:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=yeB3ptpiZzg:7e3BKd63eME:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=yeB3ptpiZzg:7e3BKd63eME:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=yeB3ptpiZzg:7e3BKd63eME:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=yeB3ptpiZzg:7e3BKd63eME:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=yeB3ptpiZzg:7e3BKd63eME:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=yeB3ptpiZzg:7e3BKd63eME:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/yeB3ptpiZzg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 09 Apr 2021 15:06:38 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"86f0d76ed2e1603aae8701bac2c22cd8","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn35@2020_3/2021/04/09/16-41-36-205_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Brian Heater","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn35@2020_3/2021/04/09/16-41-36-205_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn47@2020_5/2021/04/09/16-42-25-878_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn4@2020_1/2021/04/09/16-42-25-351_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=yeB3ptpiZzg:7e3BKd63eME:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn78@2020_2/2021/04/09/16-42-25-331_5d718053e6ee8afd.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=yeB3ptpiZzg:7e3BKd63eME:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn84@2020_4/2021/04/09/16-42-25-927_83351230b6862532.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn67@2020_3/2021/04/09/16-42-25-759_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/yeB3ptpiZzg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn83@2020_1/2021/04/09/16-42-25-472_7056e2528a65ea39.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617986495985},{"createdTime":"2021-04-10 00:41:35","updatedTime":"2021-04-10 00:41:35","title":"The 2022 Chevrolet Bolt EUV lowers the cost of entry for some of GM’s most advanced tech","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2133429","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">The 2022 Chevy Bolt EUV may look like a larger, slightly longer Chevrolet Bolt, but under that boxy exterior lies a whole lot of tech that&#8217;s both affordable and very advanced. With the launch of the Chevy Bolt EUV, and its available suite of advanced driver assistance systems, GM is putting both advanced driver assistance technology and electric drivetrains within reach of the masses.</p>\n<p>As part of GMs much-touted goal to introduce 30 new electric vehicles in the next four years, the company recently launched an updated Bolt, as well as the all-new Bolt EUV, or Electric Utility Vehicle. I had two separate opportunities to test prototypes of the Bolt EUV with GM&#8217;s advanced Super Cruise system.</p>\n<p>While the Bolt and Bolt EUV share similar DNA, they are two different vehicles. The EUV is the longer and larger of the two, with more bells and whistles, like Super Cruise: An advanced driver assistance system that allows for hands-free driving on certain highways, available as a $2,200 option. Super Cruise is not available on the 2022 Bolt.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<h2>Nuts and bolts</h2>\n<p>The Bolt EUV is powered by a 288-cell, 65-kWh battery pack that Chevy says makes 200 hp and 266 lb-ft of torque. Chevrolet estimates that the EUV will get 250 miles on a full charge, and when charging on the go, can regain up to 95 miles of range in 30 minutes on a Level 2 charger.</p>\n<p>On household power, (specifically 240V) the EUV will take around 7-8 hours to charge up to 100%, which is how Chevy says it expects most consumers will power their crossover. To assist with that, Chevrolet had teamed up with home charging installer Qmerit to offer free charger installation if you buy or lease a new Bolt or EUV. Installation of a home charger can cost as much as $2,000, so it&#8217;s a decent incentive.</p>\n<p>The Bolt EUV won&#8217;t get the upgraded Ultium battery pack and underlying architecture that&#8217;s coming on the Hummer EV, Cadillac Lyric and other future GM electric vehicles. Instead, the Bolt EUV is built on the BEV2 architecture, the same one on which the 2021 Bolt is built. As mentioned, it also gets Super Cruise as an optional add-on.</p>\n<p>Since Super Cruise&#8217;s introduction in 2017, the system has been siloed in Cadillac products, showing up on the 2018 CT6 and finally expanding to the 2021 CT5. The Bolt EUV is the first production vehicle outside of a luxury GM brand to offer the system even as paid upgrade.</p>\n<p>The Bolt EUV starts at $33,995, which is $2,500 less than the 2021 Bolt that is sitting on dealer lots today. The 2022 Chevy Bolt ($31,995) is also around $4,500 cheaper than the 2021 Bolt. Chevy&#8217;s press department says that the goal is to &#8220;make EVs attainable to everyone.&#8221; Although this is also likely an effort to bring the new vehicles in line with earlier Bolt models that qualified for the $7,500 federal tax credit. That incentive in the U.S. disappeared after GM sold 200,000 EVs nationwide.</p>\n<p>The Launch Edition, which included the optional Super Cruise, a lighted charging port and special badging, carried a sticker price of $43,495. As of this writing, reservations for the Launch Edition are completely full, but you can still reserve an LT or Premier trim in the 2022 Bolt EUV. Super Cruise, however, is only available as a $2,200 option on the Premier trim, which starts at $38,495. Keep in mind, these prices are all before including any state or local tax incentives or rebates for electric vehicles.</p>\n<p>In contrast, a Tesla Model Y Long Range model, the most affordable of the bunch since Tesla dropped that vehicle&#8217;s base option, starts at $41,990 before incentives. Getting Tesla&#8217;s so called Full-Self Driving feature — which is not self-driving and is actually a driver assistance system — will cost you an additional $10,000.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"DGvqcsFSbI\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/can-solid-state-batteries-power-up-for-the-next-generation-of-evs/\">Can solid state batteries power up for the next generation of EVs?</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Can solid state batteries power up for the next generation of EVs?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/can-solid-state-batteries-power-up-for-the-next-generation-of-evs/embed/#?secret=DGvqcsFSbI\" data-secret=\"DGvqcsFSbI\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<h2>User experience: Super Cruise</h2>\n<p>Super Cruise, while impressive, tends to err on the side of caution when it comes to implementing the technology. The system allows for drivers to take their hands and feet off the controls on more than 200,000 miles of mapped divided highway all over the country.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If we can bring congestion and crashes to zero, then developing fully-autonomous driving is worth it,&#8221; Jeremy Short, the vehicle chief engineer who is responsible for the engineering, development, validation, testing and manufacturing of the Bolt EUV, said during my second time with the crossover. &#8220;The next 10 years are going to get really interesting in the autonomy space. Five years ago, would you have thought we would have what we have now with Super Cruise?&#8221;</p>\n<p>That being said, Super Cruise isn&#8217;t perfect, and GM continues to iterate the product, even on the Bolt EUV. During my first drive in a Bolt EUV prototype from Marina Del Rey to Burbank and back in peak Los Angeles rush hour traffic, Super Cruise seemed a little bit &#8220;off.&#8221; The system ping-ponged in the wide lanes on the highway. When the vehicle was moving under 30 mph, the system lost track of the lane markings on mapped highways like the extremely busy 405, causing it to drift toward the other lanes and switch off a number of times.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2136083\" style=\"width: 1290px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2022-Chevrolet-BoltEUV-017.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2136083\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout wp-image-2136083 size-full\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2022-Chevrolet-BoltEUV-017.jpg\" alt=\"2022 Chevrolet Bolt EUV\" width=\"1280\" height=\"970\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2022-Chevrolet-BoltEUV-017.jpg 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2022-Chevrolet-BoltEUV-017.jpg?resize=150,114 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2022-Chevrolet-BoltEUV-017.jpg?resize=300,227 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2022-Chevrolet-BoltEUV-017.jpg?resize=768,582 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2022-Chevrolet-BoltEUV-017.jpg?resize=680,515 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2022-Chevrolet-BoltEUV-017.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2136083\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">2022 Chevrolet Bolt EUV. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> GM</p></div></p>\n<p>A few weeks later, on a second prototype drive that followed a 50-mile loop originating in Carson, the system appeared to have gained its sea legs. However, both Short, who was following in another prototype vehicle, and I noted that Super Cruise in the EUV still had problems when traffic slowed below 10 mph. When cars ahead slowed, the EUV would slow appropriately, but then begin to drift across the lane once traffic moved forward, as if it had lost the lane markings. Eventually, the alert to take over would sound and Super Cruise would shut off.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I did notice some ping-ponging at low speeds,&#8221; Short said after our drive. He then joked that it will require some more engineers driving that stretch of road to teach the system to navigate it without bouncing around the lane. He also said that speed and California&#8217;s strange concrete roadbeds (they have textured surfaces that can look like lane markings to AI) can affect Super Cruise. &#8220;Think of it like tracer fire; the more data you have coming in, the more accurate the car can be.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Short says that the Super Cruise system is continually learning and updating &#8212; even if it&#8217;s fully baked on vehicles like the CT5 and CT6. Every time Super Cruise is added to a new vehicle, the sensors, software and processing needs to be updated and tweaked because each car has different weights, potential speeds, dimensions, steering and braking, space for sensors and features. For example, you will be able to get a version of Super Cruise on the 2022 Cadillac Escalade which includes automatic lane changing features. The 2022 Bolt EUV, however, doesn&#8217;t get those sensors and therefore can&#8217;t automatically change lanes.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Each vehicle that has Super Cruise implemented has different anatomy so it needs to process and do different things,&#8221; Short said. &#8220;The Super Cruise on the Bolt EUV was developed at the same time that engineers were developing it on the Escalade. There&#8217;s very different steering and braking in each car so the two systems are different.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Super Cruise qualifies as an advanced Level 2 autonomous vehicle. As the driver, you still have to remain alert, and attentive, but you can remove your hands from the steering wheel and your feet from the pedals on roads where Super Cruise is available. Sensors embedded in the steering wheel track your eyes (even at night or when you&#8217;re wearing dark sunglasses) to ensure that you are paying attention to the road ahead and not watching a movie, napping or glancing at your phone. The system doesn&#8217;t give you much leeway to take your eyes off the road while using Super Cruise, either. At 65 mph, you can reach over and change the radio station on the 10.2-inch infotainment screen but alarms will sound if you look away for more than just a few seconds.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If you were on a long drive from Los Angeles to Las Vegas,&#8221; Short explained after I asked about it, &#8220;you&#8217;d essentially be a front passenger. Both you and your passenger would be looking down the road, keeping your eyes up for any potential issues. When I did that trip with a friend and used Super Cruise, I felt the same level of fatigue that he did, which is to say, not much.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>The other bells and whistles</h2>\n<p>We haven&#8217;t had the typical full week to test the 2022 Bolt EUV to fully evaluate. However, there was enough time to evaluate some of the vehicle&#8217;s features.</p>\n<p>Chevy&#8217;s new onboard infotainment and navigation system runs on the company&#8217;s Infotainment 3 software. The system&#8217;s voice control, which has natural language processing, allowed me to do a quick search to find local charging stations.</p>\n<p>The drawback? The system brought up a number of charging stations, but didn&#8217;t indicate which ones were available, in service, out of service, or if they were part of the EvGo system, the charging company that GM has partnered with. Driver&#8217;s also can&#8217;t page through results while using Super Cruise because the driver monitoring system will notice that their eyes aren&#8217;t on the road ahead.</p>\n<p>In order to find EvGo chargers, owners need to use the myChevrolet App to locate the chargers and then send the directions to the navigation system. While driving, the system does lock out some features, and Short notes that you won&#8217;t be able to flip through pages of apps.</p>\n<p>It will be interesting to see how this plays out once we get more time in the EUV. That being said, it&#8217;s not likely to be as seamless as the Tesla charging experience.</p>\n<p>At its core, the 2022 Chevrolet Bolt EUV offers some of the most advanced driver assistance technology on the market in an EV package for an attainable price. After spending two separate four-hour stints in prototype versions of the EUV, it&#8217;s clear that this compact SUV has the space, power and high-tech capability that will allow it to go head-to-head with the likes of the Tesla Model Y, Volvo&#8217;s XC40 Recharge, Ford&#8217;s Mach-E and Volkswagen&#8217;s ID.4.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"hX2xCsO6gx\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/the-2021-volkswagen-id-4-ticks-all-the-boxes-except-one/\">The 2021 Volkswagen ID. 4 ticks all the boxes, except one</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;The 2021 Volkswagen ID. 4 ticks all the boxes, except one&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/the-2021-volkswagen-id-4-ticks-all-the-boxes-except-one/embed/#?secret=hX2xCsO6gx\" data-secret=\"hX2xCsO6gx\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=OjGFxlC78Eo:v5Zt6Bon0gE:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=OjGFxlC78Eo:v5Zt6Bon0gE:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=OjGFxlC78Eo:v5Zt6Bon0gE:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=OjGFxlC78Eo:v5Zt6Bon0gE:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=OjGFxlC78Eo:v5Zt6Bon0gE:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=OjGFxlC78Eo:v5Zt6Bon0gE:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=OjGFxlC78Eo:v5Zt6Bon0gE:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=OjGFxlC78Eo:v5Zt6Bon0gE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/OjGFxlC78Eo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 09 Apr 2021 14:35:43 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2022-Chevrolet-BoltEUV-017.jpg","linkMd5":"338ba4055b230718bfcb286c38c8c91f","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn21@2020_5/2021/04/09/16-41-36-839_9aabf6dac1adda50.webp","destWidth":1280,"destHeight":970,"sourceBytes":257374,"destBytes":99252,"author":"Abigail Bassett","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2022-Chevrolet-BoltEUV-017.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn21@2020_5/2021/04/09/16-41-36-839_9aabf6dac1adda50.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn35@2020_3/2021/04/09/16-41-36-205_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn47@2020_5/2021/04/09/16-42-25-878_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn4@2020_1/2021/04/09/16-42-25-351_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=OjGFxlC78Eo:v5Zt6Bon0gE:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn71@2020_3/2021/04/09/16-42-25-297_fa97ae2f1a7c61db.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=OjGFxlC78Eo:v5Zt6Bon0gE:D7DqB2pKExk":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn67@2020_3/2021/04/09/16-42-25-759_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/OjGFxlC78Eo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn41@2020_2/2021/04/09/16-42-25-466_687bf0601e3dd608.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617986495991},{"createdTime":"2021-04-10 00:41:35","updatedTime":"2021-04-10 00:41:35","title":"SnackMagic picks up $15M to expand from build-your-own snack boxes into a wider gifting marketplace","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2136309","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">The office shut-down at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic last year spurred huge investment in digital transformation and a wave of tech companies helping with that, but there were some distinct losers in the shift, too &#8212; specifically those whose business models were predicated on serving the very offices that disappeared overnight. Today, one of the companies that had to make an immediate pivot to keep itself afloat is announcing a round of funding, after finding itself not just growing at a clip, but making a profit, as well.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.snackmagic.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SnackMagic</a>, a build-your-own snack box service, has raised $15 million in a Series A round of funding led by Craft Ventures, with Luxor Capital also participating.</p>\n<p>(Both investors have an interesting track record in the food-on-demand space: Most recently, Luxor co-led a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/spains-glovo-picks-up-528m-as-the-food-deliver-market-continues-to-heat-up/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">$528 million round in Glovo in Spain</a>, while Craft backs/has backed the likes of Cloud Kitchens, Postmates and <a href=\"https://www.craftventures.com/portfolio\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">many more</a>).</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>The funding comes on the back of a strong year for the company, which hit a $20 million revenue run rate in eight months and turned profitable in December 2020.</p>\n<p>Founder and CEO Shaunak Amin said in an interview that the plan will be to use the funding both to continue growing SnackMagic&#8217;s existing business, as well as extend into other kinds of gifting categories. Currently, you can ship snacks anywhere in the world, but the customizable boxes &#8212; recipients are gifted an amount that they can spend, and they choose what they want in the box themselves from <a href=\"https://www.snackmagic.com/menu/featured\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SnackMagic&#8217;s menu</a>, or one that a business has created and branded as a subset of that &#8212; are only available in locations in North America, serviced by SnackMagic&#8217;s primary warehouse. Other locations are given options of pre-packed boxes of snacks right now, but the plan is to slowly extend its pick-and-mix model to more geographies, starting with the U.K.</p>\n<p>Alongside this, the company plans to continue widening the categories of items that people can gift each other beyond chocolates, chips, hot sauces and other fun food items, into areas like alcohol, meal kits, and non-food items.&#160;There&#8217;s also scope for expanding to more use cases into areas like corporate gifting, marketing and consumer services, and analytics coming out of its sales.</p>\n<p>Amin calls the data that SnackMagic is amassing about customer interest in different brands and products &#8220;the hidden gem&#8221; of the platform.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s one of the most interesting things,&#8221; he said. Brands that want to add their items to the wider pool of products &#8212; which today numbers between 700 and 800 items &#8212; also get access to a dashboard where they monitor what&#8217;s selling, how much stock is left of their own items, and so on. &#8220;One thing that is very opaque [in the CPG world] is good data.&#8221;</p>\n<p>For many of the bigger companies that lack their own direct sales channels, it&#8217;s a significantly richer data set than what they typically get from selling items in the average brick and mortar store, or from a bigger online retailer like Amazon. &#8220;All these bigger brands like Pepsi and Kellogg not only want to know this about their own products more but also about the brands they are trying to buy,&#8221; Amin said. Several of them, he added, have approached his company to partner and invest, so I guess we should watch this space.</p>\n<p>SnackMagic&#8217;s success comes from a somewhat unintended, unlikely beginning, and it&#8217;s a testament to the power of compelling, yet extensible technology that can be scaled and repurposed if necessary. In its case, there is personalization technology, logistics management, product inventory and accounting, and lots of data analytics involved.</p>\n<p>The company started out as Stadium, a lunch delivery service in New York City that was leveraging the fact that when co-workers ordered lunch or dinner together for the office &#8212; say around a team-building event or a late-night working session, or just for a regular work day &#8212; oftentimes they found that people all hankered for different things to eat.</p>\n<p>In many cases, people typically make separate orders for the different items, but that also means if you are ordering to all eat together, things would not arrive at the same time; if it&#8217;s being expensed, it&#8217;s more complicated on that front too; and if you&#8217;re thinking about carbon footprints, it might also mean a lot less efficiency on that front too.</p>\n<p>Stadium&#8217;s solution was a platform that provided access to multiple restaurants&#8217; menus, and people could pick from all of them for a single order.&#160;The business had been operating for six years and was really starting to take off.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We were quite well known in the city, and we had plans to expand, and we were on track for March 2020 being our best month ever,&#8221; Amin said. Then, Covid-19 hit. &#8220;There was no one left in the office,&#8221; he said. Revenue disappeared overnight, since the idea of delivering many items to one place instantly stopped being a need.</p>\n<p>Amin said that they took a look at the platform they had built to pick many options (and many different costs, and the accounting that came with that) and thought about how to use that for a different end. It turned out that even with people working remotely, companies wanted to give props to their workers, either just to say hello and thanks, or around a specific team event, in the form of food and treats &#8212; all the more so since the supply of snacks you typically come across in so many office canteens and kitchens were no longer there for workers to tap.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s interesting, but perhaps also unsurprising, that one of the by-products of our new way of working has been the rise of more services that cater (no pun intended) to people working in more decentralised ways, and that companies exploring how to improve rewarding people in those environments are also seeing a bump.</p>\n<p>Just yesterday, we wrote about a company called <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/alyce-an-ai-based-personalised-corporate-gifting-startup-raises-30m/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Alyce raising $30 million for its corporate gifting platform</a> that is also based on personalization &#8212; using AI to help understand the interests of the recipient to make better choices of items that a person might want to receive.</p>\n<p>Alyce is taking a somewhat different approach to SnackMagic: it&#8217;s not holding any products itself, and there is no warehouse but rather a platform that links up buyers with those providing products. And Alyce&#8217;s initial audience is different, too: instead of internal employees (the first, but not final, focus for SnackMagic) it is targeting corporate gifting, or presents that sales and marketing people might send to prospects or current clients as a please and thank you gesture.</p>\n<p>But you can also see how and where the two might meet in the middle &#8212; and compete not just with each other, but the many other online retailers, Amazon and otherwise, plus the consumer goods companies themselves looking for ways of diversifying business by extending beyond the B2C channel.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We don’t worry about Amazon. We just get better,&#8221; Amin said when I asked him about whether he worried that SnackMagic was too easy to replicate. &#8220;It might be tough anyway,&#8221; he added, since &#8220;others might have the snacks but picking and packing and doing individual customization is very different from regular e-commerce. It&#8217;s really more like scalable gifting.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Investors are impressed with the quick turnaround and identification of a market opportunity, and how it quickly retooled its tech to make it fit for purpose.</p>\n<p>“SnackMagic’s immediate success was due to an excellent combination of timing, innovative thinking and world-class execution,” said Bryan Rosenblatt, principal investor at Craft Ventures, in a statement. “As companies embrace the future of a flexible workplace, SnackMagic is not just a snack box delivery platform but a company culture builder.”</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=kuVUz2L_1r0:hEjxSzgE7XM:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=kuVUz2L_1r0:hEjxSzgE7XM:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=kuVUz2L_1r0:hEjxSzgE7XM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=kuVUz2L_1r0:hEjxSzgE7XM:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=kuVUz2L_1r0:hEjxSzgE7XM:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=kuVUz2L_1r0:hEjxSzgE7XM:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=kuVUz2L_1r0:hEjxSzgE7XM:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=kuVUz2L_1r0:hEjxSzgE7XM:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/kuVUz2L_1r0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 09 Apr 2021 11:00:56 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"390410b2057c70d0e5267582cbe4fe6f","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn35@2020_3/2021/04/09/16-41-36-205_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Ingrid Lunden","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn35@2020_3/2021/04/09/16-41-36-205_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn47@2020_5/2021/04/09/16-42-25-878_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn4@2020_1/2021/04/09/16-42-25-351_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=kuVUz2L_1r0:hEjxSzgE7XM:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn32@2020_6/2021/04/09/16-42-25-462_ba87abe5954acb9d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=kuVUz2L_1r0:hEjxSzgE7XM:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn99@2020_1/2021/04/09/16-42-25-659_c0a40befbb8a91f0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn67@2020_3/2021/04/09/16-42-25-759_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/kuVUz2L_1r0":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn91@2020_6/2021/04/09/16-42-25-486_639667a6beb11c8a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617986495980},{"createdTime":"2021-04-10 00:41:36","updatedTime":"2021-04-10 00:41:36","title":"Daily Crunch: KKR invests $500M into Box","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2136193","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Box gets some financial ammunition against an activist investor, Samsung launches the Galaxy SmartTag+ and we look at the history of CryptoPunks.

when Facebook removed a mere 188 groups and disabled 24 user accounts. Although it&#8217;s not clear how many accounts the tech giant has banned and/or suspended this time it has removed orders of magnitude more groups. (We&#8217;ve asked.)</p>\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> We understand that the regulator has focused on the removal of groups trading misleading/fake reviews, rather than individual accounts &#8212; as banned or suspended users are able to create new profiles, whereas removing the group in which fake reviews are being traded is seen as a more effective way to impact and deter the activity.</p>\n<p>Facebook was also contacted with questions but it did not answer what we asked directly, sending us this statement instead:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“We have engaged extensively with the CMA to address this issue. Fraudulent and deceptive activity is not allowed on our platforms, including offering or trading fake reviews. Our safety and security teams are continually working to help prevent these practices.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Since the CMA has been raising the issue of fake review trading, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/06/facebook-still-full-of-groups-trading-fake-reviews-says-consumer-group/\">Facebook has been repeatedly criticised</a> for not doing enough to clean up its platforms, plural.</p>\n<p>Today the regulator said the social media giant has made further changes to the systems it uses for &#8220;identifying, removing and preventing the trading of fake and/or misleading reviews on its platforms to ensure it is fulfilling its previous commitments&#8221;.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not clear why it&#8217;s taken Facebook well over a year &#8212; and a number of high profile interventions &#8212; to dial up action against the trade in fake reviews. But the company suggested that the resources it has available to tackle the problem had been strained as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated impacts, such as home working. (Facebook&#8217;s <a href=\"https://investor.fb.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2021/Facebook-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2020-Results/default.aspx\">full year revenue</a> increased in 2020 but so too did its expenses.)</p>\n<p>According to the CMA changes Facebook has made to its system for combating traders of fake reviews include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>suspending or banning users who are repeatedly creating Facebook groups and Instagram profiles that promote, encourage or facilitate fake and misleading reviews</li>\n<li>introducing new automated processes that will improve the detection and removal of this content</li>\n<li>making it harder for people to use Facebook’s search tools to find fake and misleading review groups and profiles on Facebook and Instagram</li>\n<li>putting in place dedicated processes to make sure that these changes continue to work effectively and stop the problems from reappearing</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Again it&#8217;s not clear why Facebook would not have already been suspending or banning repeat offenders &#8212; at least, not if it was actually taking good faith action to genuinely quash the problem, rather than seeing if it could get away with doing the bare minimum.</p>\n<p>Commenting in a statement, Andrea Coscelli, chief executive of the CMA, essentially makes that point, saying: &#8220;Facebook has a duty to do all it can to stop the trading of such content on its platforms. After we intervened again, the company made significant changes &#8212; but it is disappointing it has taken them over a year to fix these issues.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;We will continue to keep a close eye on Facebook, including its Instagram business.

We have done that,&#8221; Li Yongqin, general manager of Indiegogo China, exhorted a room of entrepreneurs. &#8220;Next, we will bravely ride the tide and accept the challenge of coming the brands loved by users around the world.&#8221;</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>For Midea, &#8220;crowdfunding gives us a very direct way to understand consumers,&#8221; said Chen Zhenrui, who oversees the group&#8217;s overseas e-commerce initiative.

In most cases, backers get perks or rewards from the project they fund.</p>\n<p>Midea <a href=\"https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/midea-the-window-air-conditioner-reinvented#/\">raised $1.5 million</a> last year for a new air conditioner unit launched on Indiegogo, an almost negligible amount compared to the 280 billion yuan ($42 billion) annual revenue it generated in 2019. But the support from its 3,600 backers on Indiegogo was more a proof of concept.</p>\n<p>Within a few weeks, Midea learned that a compact air conditioner that saddles snugly on the window sill, blocks out noise and saves energy could entice many American consumers. Like other established Chinese home appliances makers, Midea had been exporting for several decades.</p>\n<p>But &#8220;in the past, much of our overseas business was in the traditional, B2B export realm. I think we are still far from being a world-class brand,&#8221; said Chen.</p>\n<p>When Midea first launched on Indiegogo, a user left comments on its campaign page calling the project a scam: How could a Fortune Global 500 company be on Indiegogo?</p>\n<p>&#8220;Through rounds of communication, we got to know each other. That user gave us a big push,&#8221; Chen recalled, adding that Midea used a dozen of suggestions from Indiegogo backers to improve its product.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2136299\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2136299\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2136299 size-full\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/45911617951684_.pic_hd.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/45911617951684_.pic_hd.jpg 4032w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/45911617951684_.pic_hd.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/45911617951684_.pic_hd.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/45911617951684_.pic_hd.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/45911617951684_.pic_hd.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/45911617951684_.pic_hd.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/45911617951684_.pic_hd.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/45911617951684_.pic_hd.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2136299\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Li Yongqin, general manager of Indiegogo China, exhorted a room of entrepreneurs to develop brands loved by global users.

Padmate, based in the southern coastal city of Xiamen, built a new earbud brand called Pamu from its foundation as a white-label maker of sound systems.</p>\n<p>Edison Shen, a director at Padmate, said that traditional export was getting harder as old-school distributors became squeezed by new retail channels like e-commerce. By creating their own brands and reaching consumers directly, factories could also improve profit margins. Padmate went on Indiegogo in 2018 and raised <a href=\"https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/pamu-slide-born-for-music-never-fall-out#/\">over $6.6 million</a> in one of its wireless headphone campaigns.</p>\n<p>Most of the projects on Indiegogo will go beyond the <a href=\"https://www.indiegogo.com/about/our-story\">9-million-backer</a> crowdfunding site onto mainstream platforms, listing on Amazon as well as advertising on Google and Facebook. Though the core services of these American Big Tech firms aren&#8217;t available in China, they have all set up some form of operational presence in China, whether it&#8217;s stationing staff in the country like Amazon or working through local ad resellers like Facebook.</p>\n<p>Indiegogo itself opened its China office in Shenzhen five years ago and has since seen China-based projects raise over $300 million through its platform, according to Lu Li, general manager for Indiegogo’s global strategy. China is now the company&#8217;s fastest-growing market and accounted for over 40% of the campaigns that raised over $1 million in 2020.</p>\n<p>Kickstarter, a rival to Indiegogo, also saw a surge in projects from China, which reached a <a href=\"https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/dLvvZ_AnMvamxS6AjjCi8A\">record $60.5 million</a> in funding in 2020. The Brooklyn-based company recently began looking for a <a href=\"https://jobs.lever.co/kickstarter/e4027911-54dd-4549-aacb-f7404f3d1665\">contractor</a> in Shenzhen or the adjacent city Hong Kong to help it research the Chinese market.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In recent years, more Chinese companies are getting the hang of crowdfunding and taking their brand global, so &#8216;blockbuster&#8217; campaigns [from China] are also on the rise,&#8221; observed Li.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"eHh9lTj29X\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/chinese-hardware-global-expansion-geopolitics/\">Despite global headwinds, Chinese hardware startups remain to take on the world</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Despite global headwinds, Chinese hardware startups remain to take on the world&#8221;

Kunst was unable to comment on her fundraising efforts.</p>\n<p>That new AUM number is close to what Cleo Capital initially set out to do. When Kunst first launched her firm, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/28/cleo-capital-sets-10m-target-to-fund-female-entrepreneurs/\">she targeted a $10 million close.</a> She ended up closing $3.14 million of that goal, and now, she’s back to double down.</p>\n<p>Fund II’s $20 million target, if closed, would allow Cleo Capital, which invests in primarily pre-seed companies, to start leading rounds. The firm has already been writing $1 million checks and targets about a 15-20% ownership in its rounds.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>“One of the reasons why we are a pre-seed fund is because in seed, especially late-seed, you have everyone from family offices to TikTok stars and rolling funds competing for hot rounds,” she said. “No one is competing in pre-seed.”</p>\n<p>There are firms such as Precursor and Hustle Fund that back pre-seed companies, and cut checks around $100,000 and $25,000 to start, respectively. Kunst sees the ability to write a $1 million pre-seed check as a “huge advantage.” Usually early-stage founders without family money or deep networks have to spend a big chunk of time raising their first round. It’s a lot of time to spend fundraising and not building a company. If a firm can cut a big pre-seed check, she thinks that Cleo is “buying back six months of a company‘s runway,” she said.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/11/as-covid-19-era-drags-on-vcs-look-beyond-zoom-calls-for-due-diligence-and-sourcing/\">Like many firms</a>, Cleo Capital has turned to creative measures to diversify deal flow in the era of Zoom investing and pandemic business. For example, Cleo Capital<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/28/cleo-capitals-sarah-kunst-launches-a-fellowship-for-laid-off-workers/\"> launched a fellowship program</a> for laid off workers during COVID-19 to promote entrepreneurship.</p>\n<p>Matt Pauker, a repeat founder who has sold companies to Coinbase and HP Enterprise, was one of the advisors of that program. Pauker has joined Cleo Capital as a general partner presumably to line up with the timing of Fund II.</p>\n<p>While the firm has no racial or gender investment focus, about 92% of its current investments are companies started by underrepresented founders.</p>\n<p>The firm’s portfolio includes Planet FWD, mmhmm, Lunch Club, and StyleSeat. As for new opportunities, Kunst says that Cleo Capital is looking at anything that helps the individual turn into a collective. With the growth of the creator economy and solo-entrepreneurs, people need to figure out the future of income, health care, and benefit, Kunst explained.</p>\n<p>“All of these things are hard for people to do as an individual,” she said.

For one, that new $6 billion valuation,  is up 50% from the $4 billion it was valued at last November when it raised $200 million in Series D financing. It’s also up tenfold from its $600 million valuation at the time of its </span><a href=\"https://news.crunchbase.com/news/better-com-raises-160m-series-c-at-600m-valuation-to-speed-up-mortgage-lending/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Series C raise</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in August 2019.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Secondly, it’s further proof that mortgage – a traditionally “unsexy” industry that has long been in need of disruption – is officially hot. For all its controversy, when SoftBank invests, people pay attention.</span></p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The COVID-19 pandemic and historically-low mortgage rates fueled acceleration in the online lending space in a way that no one could have anticipated. That, combined with the general fervour in venture funding, means it’s not a big surprise that Better.com has raised $700 million in just a matter of months.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The investment brings Better.com’s total funding raised to over $900 million since its 2014 inception. Other backers include Goldman Sachs, Kleiner Perkins, American Express, Activant Capital and Citi, among others.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/softbank-to-invest-500-million-in-mortgage-startup-better-11617899907\">Wall Street Journal</a>, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SoftBank is buying shares from Better’s existing investors, and agreed to give all of its voting rights to CEO and founder Vishal Garg “in a sign of its eagerness” to invest in the company. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During a one-on-one interview at Lendit Fintech’s USA 2020 virtual event in October, Garg had told me that an IPO was definitely in the works.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ll do it when it’s right,” he said. “One of the core tenets of American capitalism is the ability for your customers to buy your stock.”</span></p>\n<p>And in February, Bloomberg had reported that the startup had  tapped Morgan Stanley and Bank of America Corp. for a planned initial public offering in the U.S. But there&#8217;s been no further word since. It&#8217;s not unusual for companies to raise large sums before an IPO. Affirm did it <a href=\"https://finledger.com/2020/11/18/affirm-drops-s-1-revealing-sharply-rising-revenue-on-a-narrower-net-loss/\">last year</a>, for example.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also last October, Varg had told me that before the pandemic, Better was processing about $1.2 billion a month in loans. But as of October 2020, it was funding over $2.5 billion per month, and had gone from 1,500 staffers to about 4,000 worldwide. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When the pandemic started we were doing less than sort of like $50 million a month of revenue,” he said at the time. “We’re two-and-a half times that now.”</span></p>\n<p>Since then, those numbers have gone up even more. A company spokesperson told me today that Better.com funded $14 billion in loan volume in the first quarter of 2021 alone and that it is currently funding over $4 billions in loans a month. For some context,  Better.com funded $25 billion in loan volume in all of 2020. And, it currently has 6,000 employees – up 2,000 from last October.</p>\n<p><em>This article was updated post-publication with some additional numbers provided by the company.</em></p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=hq3sxL7IqHo:4etAW3XFd0A:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=hq3sxL7IqHo:4etAW3XFd0A:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=hq3sxL7IqHo:4etAW3XFd0A:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=hq3sxL7IqHo:4etAW3XFd0A:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=hq3sxL7IqHo:4etAW3XFd0A:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=hq3sxL7IqHo:4etAW3XFd0A:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=hq3sxL7IqHo:4etAW3XFd0A:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=hq3sxL7IqHo:4etAW3XFd0A:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/hq3sxL7IqHo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 09 Apr 2021 15:01:31 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"472ef401604269a4852ee8b2e06ff852","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn35@2020_3/2021/04/09/16-41-36-205_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Mary Ann Azevedo","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn35@2020_3/2021/04/09/16-41-36-205_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn47@2020_5/2021/04/09/16-42-25-878_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn4@2020_1/2021/04/09/16-42-25-351_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=hq3sxL7IqHo:4etAW3XFd0A:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn59@2020_5/2021/04/09/16-42-25-355_2dfda74a769708d7.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=hq3sxL7IqHo:4etAW3XFd0A:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn28@2020_3/2021/04/09/16-42-25-705_0d26f328f8394745.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn67@2020_3/2021/04/09/16-42-25-759_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/hq3sxL7IqHo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn75@2020_4/2021/04/09/16-42-25-422_0bdc3e6c46118f16.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617986495987},{"createdTime":"2021-04-10 00:41:35","updatedTime":"2021-04-10 00:41:35","title":"NLPCloud.io helps devs add language processing smarts to their apps","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2136311","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">While visual &#8216;<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/tag/no-code/\">no code</a>&#8216; tools are helping businesses get more out of computing without the need for armies of in-house techies to configure software on behalf of other staff, access to the most powerful tech tools &#8212; at the &#8216;deep tech&#8217; AI coal face &#8212; still requires some expert help (and/or costly in-house expertise).</p>\n<p>This is where bootstrapping French startup, <a href=\"https://nlpcloud.io\">NLPCloud.io</a>, is plying a trade in MLOps/AIOps &#8212; or &#8216;compute platform as a service&#8217; (being as it runs the queries on its own servers) &#8212; with a focus on natural language processing (NLP), as its name suggests.</p>\n<p>Developments in artificial intelligence have, in recent years, led to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/17/openai-text-generator-dangerous/\">impressive advances in the field of NLP</a> &#8212; a technology that can help businesses scale their capacity to intelligently grapple with all sorts of communications by automating tasks like Named Entity Recognition, sentiment-analysis, text classification, summarization, question answering, and Part-Of-Speech tagging, freeing up (human) staff to focus on more complex/nuanced work.

But businesses wanting to tap into NLP still need to have the DevOps resource and chops to implement NLP models.</p>\n<p>NLPCloud.io is catering to businesses that don&#8217;t feel up to the implementation challenge themselves &#8212; offering &#8220;production-ready NLP API&#8221; with the promise of &#8220;no DevOps required&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Its API is based on <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/hugging-face-raises-40-million-for-its-natural-language-processing-library/\">Hugging Face</a> and <a href=\"https://spacy.io\">spaCy</a> open-source models. Customers can either choose to use ready-to-use pre-trained models (it selects the &#8220;best&#8221; open source models; it does not build its own); or they can upload custom models developed internally by their own data scientists &#8212; which it says is a point of differentiation vs SaaS services such as Google Natural Language (which uses Google&#8217;s ML models) or Amazon Comprehend and Monkey Learn.</p>\n<p>NLPCloud.io says it wants to democratize NLP by helping developers and data scientists deliver these projects &#8220;in no time and at a fair price&#8221;. (It has a tiered <a href=\"https://nlpcloud.io/#plans\">pricing model</a> based on requests per minute, which starts at $39pm and ranges up to $1,199pm, at the enterprise end, for one custom model running on a GPU. It does also offer a free tier so users can test models at low request velocity without incurring a charge.)</p>\n<p>&#8220;The idea came from the fact that, as a software engineer, I saw many AI projects fail because of the deployment to production phase,&#8221; says sole founder and CTO Julien Salinas. &#8220;Companies often focus on building accurate and fast AI models but today more and more excellent open-source models are available and are doing an excellent job&#8230; so the toughest challenge now is being able to efficiently use these models in production. It takes AI skills, DevOps skills, programming skill&#8230; which is why it&#8217;s a challenge for so many companies, and which is why I decided to launch NLPCloud.io.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The platform launched in January 2021 and now has around 500 users, including 30 who are paying for the service. While the startup, which is based in Grenoble, in the French Alps, is a team of three for now, plus a couple of independent contractors. (Salinas says he plans to hire five people by the end of the year.)</p>\n<p>&#8220;Most of our users are tech startups but we also start having a couple of bigger companies,&#8221; he tells TechCrunch. &#8220;The biggest demand I&#8217;m seeing is both from software engineers and data scientists. Sometimes it&#8217;s from teams who have data science skills but don&#8217;t have DevOps skills (or don&#8217;t want to spend time on this). Sometimes it&#8217;s from tech teams who want to leverage NLP out-of-the-box without hiring a whole data science team.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have very diverse customers, from solo startup founders to bigger companies like BBVA, Mintel, Senuto&#8230; in all sorts of sectors (banking, public relations, market research),&#8221; he adds.</p>\n<p>Use cases of its customers include lead generation from unstructured text (such as web pages), via named entities extraction; and sorting support tickets based on urgency by conducting sentiment analysis.</p>\n<p>Content marketers are also using its platform for headline generation (via summarization). While text classification capabilities are being used for economic intelligence and financial data extraction, per Salinas.</p>\n<p>He says his own experience as a CTO and software engineer working on NLP projects at a number of tech companies led him to spot an opportunity in the challenge of AI implementation.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I realized that it was quite easy to build acceptable NLP models thanks to great open-source frameworks like spaCy and Hugging Face Transformers but then I found it quite hard to use these models in production,&#8221; he explains. &#8220;It takes programming skills in order to develop an API, strong DevOps skills in order to build a robust and fast infrastructure to serve NLP models (AI models in general consume a lot of resources), and also data science skills of course.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I tried to look for ready-to-use cloud solutions in order to save weeks of work but I couldn&#8217;t find anything satisfactory. My intuition was that such a platform would help tech teams save a lot of time, sometimes months of work for the teams who don&#8217;t have strong DevOps profiles.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;NLP has been around for decades but until recently it took whole teams of data scientists to build acceptable NLP models. For a couple of years, we&#8217;ve made amazing progress in terms of accuracy and speed of the NLP models. More and more experts who have been working in the NLP field for decades agree that NLP is becoming a &#8216;commodity&#8217;,&#8221; he goes on. &#8220;Frameworks like spaCy make it extremely simple for developers to leverage NLP models without having advanced data science knowledge. And Hugging Face&#8217;s open-source repository for NLP models is also a great step in this direction.</p>\n<p>&#8220;But having these models run in production is still hard, and maybe even harder than before as these brand new models are very demanding in terms of resources.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The models NLPCloud.io offers are picked for performance &#8212; where &#8220;best&#8221; means it has &#8220;the best compromise between accuracy and speed&#8221;. Salinas also says they are paying mind to context, given NLP can be used for diverse user cases &#8212; hence proposing number of models so as to be able to adapt to a given use.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Initially we started with models dedicated to entities extraction only but most of our first customers also asked for other use cases too, so we started adding other models,&#8221; he notes, adding that they will continue to add more models from the two chosen frameworks &#8212; &#8220;in order to cover more use cases, and more languages&#8221;.</p>\n<p>SpaCy and Hugging Face, meanwhile, were chosen to be the source for the models offered via its API based on their track record as companies, the NLP libraries they offer and their focus on production-ready framework &#8212; with the combination allowing NLPCloud.io to offer a selection of models that are fast and accurate, working within the bounds of respective trade-offs, according to Salinas.</p>\n<p>&#8220;SpaCy is developed by a solid company in Germany called Explosion.ai. This library has become one of the most used NLP libraries among companies who want to leverage NLP in production &#8216;for real&#8217; (as opposed to academic research only). The reason is that it is very fast, has great accuracy in most scenarios, and is an opinionated&#8221; framework which makes it very simple to use by non-data scientists (the tradeoff is that it gives less customization possibilities),&#8221; he says.</p>\n<p>&#8220;<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/17/hugging-face-raises-15-million-to-build-the-definitive-natural-language-processing-library/\">Hugging Face</a> is an even more solid company that <a title=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/hugging-face-raises-40-million-for-its-natural-language-processing-library/\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/hugging-face-raises-40-million-for-its-natural-language-processing-library/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/hugging-face-raises-40-million-for-its-natural-language-processing-library/&#38;source=gmail&#38;ust=1618050204207000&#38;usg=AFQjCNEmZDvxn9bG1Q7PE1ap2fYv2iJmDw\">recently raised $40M</a> for a good reason: They created a disruptive NLP library called &#8216;transformers&#8217; that improves a lot the accuracy of NLP models (the tradeoff is that it is very resource intensive though). It gives the opportunity to cover more use cases like sentiment analysis, classification, summarization&#8230; In addition to that, they created an open-source repository where it is easy to select the best model you need for your use case.&#8221;</p>\n<p>While AI is advancing at a clip within certain tracks &#8212; such as NLP for English &#8212; there are still caveats and potential pitfalls attached to automating language processing and analysis, with the risk of getting stuff wrong or worse. AI models trained on human-generated data have, for example, been shown reflecting embedded biases and prejudices of the people who produced the underlying data.</p>\n<p>Salinas agrees NLP can sometimes face &#8220;concerning bias issues&#8221;, such as racism and misogyny.

Using that baseline data, Neuralink was able to use machine learning to anticipate where Pager was going to be moving the physical controller, and was eventually able to predict it accurately before the move was actually made. Researchers then removed the paddle entirely, and eventually did the same thing with Pong, ultimately ending up at a place where Pager no longer was even moving its hand on the air on the nonexistent paddle, and was instead controlling the in-game action entirely with its mind via the Link hardware and embedded neural threads.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>\t<div class=\"article-block block--callout block--right\" >\n\t\t<h4 class=\"block--callout__title\">Read more on TechCrunch</h4>\n\t\t\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/16/greg-epstein-douglas-rushkoff-team-human-interview/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Douglas Rushkoff on ‘Team Human’ and fighting for our place in the future</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/28/deep-science-robot-perception-acoustic-monitoring-using-ml-to-detect-arthritis/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Deep Science: Robot perception, acoustic monitoring, using ML to detect arthritis</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/28/take-a-closer-look-at-elon-musks-neuralink-surgical-robot/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Take a closer look at Elon Musk’s Neuralink surgical robot</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/27/elon-musks-neuralink-wants-to-boost-the-brain-to-keep-up-with-ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Elon Musk’s Neuralink wants to boost the brain to keep up with AI</a></li>\n</ul>\n\t</div>\n\t</p>\n<p>The last we saw of Neuralink, Musk himself was demonstrating the Link tech live in August 2020, using pigs to show how it was able to read signals from the brain depending on different stimuli.

Things have been fairly quiet in the eye of the storm for most of it. That changed today, however, as vote counting began in earnest. Thus far, things are breaking pretty dramatically in the company’s favor, following a hard-fought <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/amazon-goes-on-the-offensive-ahead-of-next-weeks-union-vote-counting/\">anti-union campaign</a>.</p>\n<p>As of the end of the day, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/04/08/amazon-bessemer-mailbox-union/\">no votes have more than doubled</a> the yeses, at 1,100 to 463. With counting resuming &#8212; and likely concluding &#8212; tomorrow, the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, which would potentially serve as the worker’s union, is decrying the company’s tactics.</p>\n<p>“Our system is broken, Amazon took full advantage of that, and we will be calling on the labor board to hold Amazon accountable for its illegal and egregious behavior during the campaign,” RWDSU President Stuart Appelbaum said in a statement provided to TechCrunch. “But make no mistake about it; this still represents an important moment for working people and their voices will be heard.”</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>The comments appear to be as much about actions the company has taken during the campaign as it is bracing for a likely challenge to the results. The numbers constitute around half of the 3,215 ballots that are being counted. They put Amazon around 500 no votes away from defeating union efforts.</p>\n<p>We have reached out to the company for a response to Appelbaum’s comment, but have not heard back. In a comment offered to TechCrunch last month, the company had less than stellar words about Appelbaum, calling the union head the “Chief Disinformation Officer,” adding that “in an attempt to save his long declining union, [he] is taking alternative facts to a whole new level.”</p>\n<p>Regardless of the final count, this process is likely to be drawn out.

Clicking on the ad would open a fake Clubhouse website, including a mocked-up screenshot of what the non-existent PC app looks like, with a download link to the malicious app.</p>\n<p>When opened, the malicious app tries to communicate with a command and control server to obtain instructions on what to do next. One <a href=\"https://www.vmray.com/analyses/acc6e8793536/report/overview.html\">sandbox analysis of the malware</a> showed the malicious app tried to infect the isolated machine with ransomware.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>But overnight, the fake Clubhouse websites — which were hosted in Russia — went offline. In doing so, the malware also stopped working.

The company is currently testing its product with a soft launch. Users get a Mastercard payment card paired with an e-wallet.</p>\n<p>Each Vybe account comes with its own IBAN so that users can send and receive money. If you want to open an account and you are less than 18 years old, you have to go through the KYC process (know your identity) with your parent.</p>\n<p>As for parents, they can set up some limits on card payments or even block the card. Parents can also view transactions. The startup plans to generate revenue from interchange fees as well as partnership with brands and a reward system.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>While Vybe isn’t technically live, the company has attracted 375,000 downloads. Overall, 260,000 teens have pre-ordered a card already. Thousands of cards have been delivered and the first metrics are encouraging. Early adopters tend to use their card once every two days.</p>\n<p>Today’s fund is a round extension from existing investors. Investors include Ronan Le Moal, the former CEO of Crédit Mutuel Arkéa, Kick Club and Manoel Amorim.</p>\n<p>Banking products for teenagers are a lucrative segment. In France, there are several companies trying to position themselves on this segment, such as <a href=\"https://www.kard.eu\">Kard</a>, <a href=\"https://www.pixpay.fr\">PixPay</a> and <a href=\"https://www.xaalys.com\">Xaalys</a>. Most of these companies charge a subscription fee to access the service.</p>\n<p>Other fintech companies that aren’t specifically targeting young people could also work well with teenagers. For instance, young users can open a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/17/revolut-launches-revolut-junior-to-help-you-manage-allowance/\">Revolut Junior</a> or <a href=\"https://lydia-app.com\">Lydia</a> account and receive money from their parents.</p>\n<p>In the U.S., startups offering debit cards for children are about to reach unicorn status.
