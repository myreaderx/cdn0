They captured soil and rock and then sealed off the precious extraterrestrial material. </p><p>One of the samples, 73001, has been fastened shut for half a century. But in recent weeks, scientists pierced the metal tube to reveal what's inside. Mashable spoke with these researchers, clad in their white clean-room attire, via a video chat just after they'd collected rare moon gases from sample 73001. It's one of the last remaining unopened lunar specimens. </p><p>Apollo Astronauts Eugene Cernan and Harrison \"Jack\" Schmitt, who gathered 73001 from the ancient <a href=\"https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a17/a17.site.html\">Valley of Taurus-Littrow</a>, couldn't have known NASA would store the sample for the lengthy span of <i>10 presidential administrations</i> inside a specialized lab at NASA's Johnson Space Center. But the space agency waited until the technology to sleuth out the tube's untainted contents had progressed.</p><p>\"We were waiting for the instruments to get better,\" Ryan Zeigler, NASA's Apollo sample curator, told Mashable. Before we spoke on March 8, Zeigler worked with Juliane Gross, a planetary scientist at Rutgers University, and Rita Parai, a geochemist at Washington University in St. Louis, to collect the lunar gases.</p><q>\n    \"This gives us our best chance to learn what gas is leaking out of the moon.\"\n    </q>\n<p>Yet the decision to unseal the rare sample was nudged by more than scientific curiosity and technological advancement. NASA is building a new megarocket, the powerful Space Launch System, and has designs to return to the moon, <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/nasa-moon-artemis-training\">specifically the shadowy South Pole</a>, later this decade. All the lunar samples gathered between 1969 and 1972 &mdash; <a href=\"https://curator.jsc.nasa.gov/lunar/\">all 842 pounds</a> &mdash; are from the dayside of the moon, somewhat near the moon's equator. But before NASA returns to a disparate southern region to scour the area for valuable resources (like hydrogen, oxygen, and ice), the agency wants to know what gases seep from the moon, and what exactly is in the equatorial rock gathered by Apollo astronauts. NASA needs to gauge what they might discover in the South Pole, and compare how different &mdash; or valuable &mdash; the resources are in this new region.</p><p>That's where the gases sealed in sample 73001 come into play. \"This gives us our best chance to learn what gas is leaking out of the moon,\" NASA's Zeigler said. </p><div class=\"w-full mx-auto max-w-3xl font-sans mt-8 text-lg leading-loose md:text-xl md:leading-7\">\n        <span class=\"font-bold text-primary-400\">SEE ALSO:</span>\n        <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/space-diamond-carbonado-auction\" class=\"text-secondary-300\">\n            Is the mysterious 'space diamond' for real?

Different planetary scientists and geologists with different expertise will inspect the composition of these moon fragments. Some salient goals include better understanding resources on the moon (like water ice), and the origins of different elements. </p><p>When future astronauts, perhaps later this decade, collect moon samples, they'll work in remarkably different environs than the lunar explorers of half a century ago. The Apollo astronauts roved around the moon in bright sunlight. But in the lunar South Pole, the moon barely rises over the horizon. It's an eerie, dark, and shadowy place.</p><p>And if all goes as planned, astronauts will return new, precious lunar samples to the vault at NASA's Johnson Space Center.</p><div class=\"eloquent-imagery-image\">\n    <div class=\"flex justify-center\">\n        <img class=\"border border-gray-100 h-full\" src=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/00BxoSpPV9jZhRiR4iF19rs/images-3.fit_lim.size_2000x.v1647015729.png\" alt=\"scientists collecting lunar gases from a moon sample\" srcset=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/00BxoSpPV9jZhRiR4iF19rs/images-3.fit_lim.size_800x.v1647015729.png 800w,https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/00BxoSpPV9jZhRiR4iF19rs/images-3.fit_lim.size_1400x.v1647015729.png 1400w,https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/00BxoSpPV9jZhRiR4iF19rs/images-3.fit_lim.size_2000x.v1647015729.png 1600w\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1408px) 100vw, 1408px\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1223\">\n\n\n    </div>\n            <div class=\"mt-4 subtitle-2 font-sans text-left\">\n            <span class=\"text-gray-1000 normal-case\">Scientists at Johnson Space Center using the manifold instrument to collect lunar gases.</span>\n            <span class=\"credit text-gray-600 capitalize\">Credit: NASA / James Blair</span>\n        </div>\n    </div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Sat, 12 Mar 2022 12:00:00 +0000","feedId":91,"bgimg":"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/00BxoSpPV9jZhRiR4iF19rs/hero-image.jpg","linkMd5":"01faa1ec9a17d33564482f592c272270","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn71@2020_1/2022/03/14/08-27-02-557_8fcde77992945cda.webp","destWidth":950,"destHeight":965,"sourceBytes":154672,"destBytes":154672,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/00BxoSpPV9jZhRiR4iF19rs/hero-image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn71@2020_1/2022/03/14/08-27-02-557_8fcde77992945cda.webp","https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/00BxoSpPV9jZhRiR4iF19rs/images-1.fit_lim.size_2000x.v1646945629.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn15@2020_3/2022/03/14/08-27-26-398_5fe1ec5f706254d5.webp","https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/00BxoSpPV9jZhRiR4iF19rs/images-2.fit_lim.size_2000x.v1646947350.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn26@2020_1/2022/03/14/08-27-26-118_4f5ad9f900363741.webp","https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/00BxoSpPV9jZhRiR4iF19rs/images-3.fit_lim.size_2000x.v1647015729.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn40@2020_3/2022/03/14/08-27-25-562_3fd05f4453adc2b9.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647246421750},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:27:01","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:27:01","title":"Expand your expertise with this massive eLearning bundle on sale for under £70","link":"https://mashable.com/uk/deals/stone-river-elearning-bundle-deal","description":"<img src=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/02v8mufsO4FopHRCMdR08Di/hero-image.jpg\" alt=\"Hands on laptop\"><p><b>TL;DR: </b>The <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/mm7wN\">Stone River eLearning and StackSkills Unlimited Lifetime Membership Bundle</a> is on sale for &pound;67.68, saving you 99% on list price.</p><hr><p>Growth is impossible without knowledge.

The baby, Exa Dark Sider&aelig;l Musk (also known by the nicknames \"Y\" and \"Sailor Mars\"), was born via surrogate, according to <i>Vanity Fair</i>. The couple <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/elon-musk-grimes-baby-new-name\">welcomed a son</a>, X &AElig; A-12, pronounced \"X A.I. Archangel\" or \"X\" for short, in March 2020 &mdash; which one might see as prophetic timing. </p><p>Perhaps even more surreal than a celebrity couple with a secret baby is the way in which writer Devin Gordon discovered little Y's existence. </p><div class=\"w-full mx-auto max-w-3xl font-sans mt-8 text-lg leading-loose md:text-xl md:leading-7\">\n        <span class=\"font-bold text-primary-400\">SEE ALSO:</span>\n        <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/elon-musk-grimes-baby-new-name\" class=\"text-secondary-300\">\n            Grimes says she and Elon Musk have changed their baby's name\n                            <svg class=\"ml-1 w-4 h-4 fill-current inline-block font-normal\"><use href=\"/images/icons/spritemap.svg#sprite-arrow-right-thin\"></use></svg>\n                    </a>\n    </div>\n<p>While discussing the \"Shinigami Eyes\" singer&rsquo;s upcoming album <i>Book 1</i>, Gordon heard \"what sounds vaguely like a lone cry from an infant upstairs.\" A few moments later, he heard even more wailing: \"This time it&rsquo;s multiple cries, and it&rsquo;s unmistakable. I&rsquo;ve got two kids. That&rsquo;s a baby. And I can tell by the frozen look on my host&rsquo;s face that she heard it too. So I brace myself to ask the strangest question of my career: Do you have another baby in your life, Grimes?\" </p><p>The answer was, of course, yes. But can you blame Grimes for wanting to keep Y's birth a secret? </p><p>\"Whatever is going on with family stuff, I just feel like kids need to stay out of it, and [first Musk baby] X is just out there,\" Grimes said. \"I mean, I think E is really seeing him as a prot&eacute;g&eacute; and bringing him to everything and stuff... X is out there. His situation is like that.\" </p><p>And Y, for now, is all hers. \"The best situation here,\" she revealed later in the piece, \"is me training the girl and [Musk] training the boy.\" Training for what? Life on Earth as celebrity children? Life on Mars alongside their father? </p><p>The way she sees it, X is more than Musk's prot&eacute;g&eacute;. More than the son of the wealthiest man in the world &mdash; Musk is valued <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/real-time-billionaires/#16ce9ab03d78\">at over $200 billion, according to Forbes</a> &mdash; X himself is the Chosen One in his mother's eyes, mirroring the destiny of one of her favorite sci-fi heroes: <i>Dune</i>'s Paul Atreides. </p><p>\"I just know X is going to have to go through all this really fucked-up shit that sort of mirrors Paul-type stuff,\" she said. </p><p>Speaking of Mars, Musk confirmed that the plan is to <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/elon-musk-moving-to-mars-interview\">depart for the red planet</a> within the next 10 years. Grimes may or may not follow him, eventually. She described the SpaceX founder's mission not as megalomania but rather \"for the benefit of humanity, and it&rsquo;s dangerous and it&rsquo;s expensive, and people are like, 'He&rsquo;s hoarding money!' No, he&rsquo;s spending everything on R&amp;D...

To the point where I was like, can we not live in a very insecure $40,000 house?

She's just...changed. Every simulation evolves over time.

There, a team were conducting tests on the rover's mobility performance on challenging ground, as well as examining both crewed and telerobotic operations. </p><p>Hadfield said \"it was just a joy\" to be able to drive the new rover.</p><p>\"To have a chance to drive that rover, to see it's potential, it immediately appears in my mind's eye, something that looks a lot like this is going to be helping people out when we start to live on the moon &ndash;&nbsp;and eventually Mars.\"</p><h2>Want more?</h2><ul><li><p><a href=\"https://mashable.com/video/why-life-on-venus-is-better-than-mars\">The ultimate case for living on Venus</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/rocket-moon-crash-space\">A rocket will crash into the moon.

But cloud gaming can bring previews to the people at home.","link":"https://mashable.com/article/e3-2022-rumor-cloud-gaming-for-e3-at-home","description":"<img src=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/03WqHxBNCTmZSNXCaHiMi6L/hero-image.jpg\" alt=\"An exterior view of the Los Angeles Convention Center as it appeared during the E3 video game trade show in 2006.\"><p>There's buzz about a theoretical E3 2022.</p><p>First, let's face facts: It's not happening. The rumor that's floating right now around is mostly based on some chatter from GamesBeat's Jeff Grubb, who mentioned during a recent podcast that <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6qYonSzdzI\">Microsoft is planning for an \"E3-style\" event</a> in June. But even if something called \"E3\" gets announced, it's not the in-person exhibition that was <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/e3-2022-cancels-in-person-event-digital-show-uncertain\">already cancelled</a> back in January.</p><p>The show has suffered in recent years, and not just because of the ongoing pandemic. The proliferation of high-quality video streaming has made it easy for publishers to share news with the public on their own terms, removed from the all-consuming buzz of gaming's biggest U.S. trade show. Electronic Arts has been doing its own event near E3 but not at the show itself since 2016. Other major names like Nintendo and Microsoft have also scaled back their presence in other ways.</p><p>The show's organizer, the Entertainment Software Association (ESA) has also had its share of troubles. The industry group has struggled to regain the trust of the press and influencer community after a <a href=\"https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2019-08-03-e3-accidentally-leaks-personal-details-of-journalists-youtubers-and-analysts\">shockingly careless leak of attendee data</a> in 2019. And new competition from the likes of Geoff Keighley's Summer Game Fest and <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/events/summer-of-gaming\">IGN's Summer of Gaming</a> has joined old standbys like PAX and Gamescom, giving publishers more places to go to make waves with their news during the pre-holiday summer months of what is traditionally trade show season for video games.</p><p>While all of this has been going on, however, cloud gaming capabilities have leveled up repeatedly. Stadia has had <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/google-stadia-closes-two-studios\">its share of struggles</a> as a business, but Google's cloud gaming service, along with competitors like <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/amazon-luna-cloud-gaming\">Amazon's Luna</a>, capably deliver on the promise of <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/google-stadia-review-first-impressions\">high-end gaming streamed straight to your device</a> (bandwidth permitting).</p><q>\n    There's no reason that cloud-based game previews can't be opened up for a wider audience.\n    </q>\n<p>For someone like me who works on the press side of the industry, I've had closer experiences than most with the true power of this technology. Multiple major publishers rely on cloud gaming services like Parsec to bring me the hands-on preview experience at home. It's fantastic. </p><p>From my perspective as a full-time remote worker, streaming a game preview to my home computer is a welcome alternative to shlepping off to meetings that are a two-hour commute away. And from the publisher perspective, the security benefit speaks for itself: No one can pirate a playing experience that is managed remotely, by the publisher. They flip a switch and it's game over, literally.</p><p>There's no technical reason that cloud-based game previews can't be opened up for a wider audience. Even if it's not under an \"E3\" banner, publishers have lots to gain and little to lose by letting you and your friends check out the kind of polished gameplay demonstration that gets trotted out at trade shows. </p><p>At the behind the scenes level, lots of demo experiences are projects unto themselves that stand apart from the ongoing work of building whatever game. If all that extra work is happening anyway, why not put it in front of more people? Reading a preview that someone else has written isn't nearly as instructive as playing the polished demo that write-up is derived from yourself.</p><p>Publishers have often shied away from showing off unfinished work to people who aren't industry professionals. Which is totally fair: Games that aren't finished are usually a hotbed of bugs and unexpected issues. Those who work in the industry understand and make allowances for that before forming a judgment.</p><p>But as loud as the community can sometimes be, gamers are a pretty plugged in bunch. The proliferation of \"early access\" games &mdash; which is to say, titles that are released unfinished, often at a reduced price, and developed as feedback comes in &mdash; and public beta tests in recent years has helped people better understand the process that unfolds as a game comes together. </p><p>In 2022, you don't need to be an industry professional to \"get it.\" Game makers have been implicitly teaching their audiences how the development process works for a very long time. They've even monetized it in some cases, turning something like access to a public beta test into the stuff of pre-order bonuses.</p><div class=\"w-full mx-auto max-w-3xl font-sans mt-8 text-lg leading-loose md:text-xl md:leading-7\">\n        <span class=\"font-bold text-primary-400\">SEE ALSO:</span>\n        <a href=\"https://mashable.com/video/devolver-digital-e3-2021-showcase\" class=\"text-secondary-300\">\n            If you've never seen an E3 showcase from Devolver Digital, it's time to treat yourself\n                            <svg class=\"ml-1 w-4 h-4 fill-current inline-block font-normal\"><use href=\"/images/icons/spritemap.svg#sprite-arrow-right-thin\"></use></svg>\n                    </a>\n    </div>\n<ul><li><p><a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/best-wordle-clones-alternatives\"><b>14 of the best 'Wordle' clones, because one word a day isn't enough</b></a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/god-of-war-amazon-series-cast-chris\"><b>Kratos in Amazon's 'God of War' series should be Christopher Judge's job to lose</b></a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/elden-ring-tips-soulsborne-beginners\"><b>3 crucial mistakes 'Elden Ring' newcomers should avoid to maximize the fun</b></a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/dota-2-how-to-play\"><b>How to start playing 'Dota 2'</b></a></p></li></ul><p>Now, bring that thinking to the trade show circuit. Anyone can stream Electronic Arts' slate of reveals in the publisher's annual EA Play broadcast. But what if you could, for a small fee, sign up for some kind of \"VIP access\" that would open the door to hands-on opportunities as well?</p><p>The premise I'm attacking this from is \"publishers <i>should</i> do this,\" but truly, I think it's only a matter of time before it actually happens. Cloud gaming has already changed the landscape for preview access in the press, with the switch away from in-person meetings opening them up to a wider range of people. It's not a far leap to imagine similar opportunities being offered to the general public, especially in a world where things like <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/steam-next-fest-coming-in-june-will-feature-hundreds-of-game-demos\">Steam Next Fest already exists</a>.</p><p>Don't forget, E3 was never a public event... until it <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/e3-2017-open-to-public-tickets\">started transforming into one</a> in 2016. So whether or not that specific trade show comes back, the thinking that's always guided it &mdash; a festival of video game reveals and previews &mdash; can now be extended from insiders-only to outsiders as well in a way that hasn't been possible before.

It&rsquo;s considered the best way to bring out aromas and flavors in your wine. Not all wines need <a href=\"https://www.thekitchn.com/do-you-have-a-wine-145131\">decanting</a>, but many can benefit from it.</p><p>If you don&rsquo;t own a decanter, and you&rsquo;re a &ldquo;go big or go home&rdquo; kind of wine drinker, the <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/jBjpy\">Wake Up Wine Pro S</a> is on sale for 43% off as of March 11. Featured <a href=\"https://mashable.com/deals/june-12-electronic-wine-decanter-sale\">previously</a>, it's a 750ml electronic glass decanter that can filter out impurities as fine as a millimeter with its sediment strainer.</p><p>You can easily set and adjust the decanting time at the push of a button. And with a full charge, you should get about eight hours of continuous decanting. If you need a little help and don&rsquo;t feel like scouring Google for answers, you can take a quick peek at the wine and spirit guide to understand decanting times.</p><p>To make your wine drinking experience even merrier, the base of the Wine Pro S also serves as a mini party hub. It features built-in Bluetooth 3D speakers, so you can play 360-degree, omni-directional music right from your device. Play your go-to girls night playlist to set the tone for a fun night, or go with more romantic jazz tunes for an upscale wine-tasting experience. The base&rsquo;s tricolor changing light ring even syncs with your tunes for a full audio-visual experience. Add the delicious smells and flavors mixing up in your wine and all of your senses can be heightened and enlightened.</p><p>Grab the Wine Pro S Electronic Decanter for just <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/jBjpy\">$169.99</a> (regularly $299) for a limited time.</p><p><i>Prices subject to change.</i></p><p></p><div class=\"max-w-3xl mx-auto mb-16 font-sans flex flex-col mt-8 md:flex-row\" data-ga-module=\"deal-card\" data-ga-element=\"offer\">\n    <div class=\"w-64 mx-auto md:mx-0 md:w-1/3\">\n                    <a class=\"block\" href=\"https://zdcs.link/jBjpy?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall&amp;short_url=jBjpy&amp;cd36=Standard&amp;t=deals&amp;m=deal-card&amp;e=offer&amp;i=image&amp;el=image\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" data-ga-action=\"product_image\" data-ga-label=\"image\" data-ga-item=\"image\" data-ga-click data-commerce-click>\n                <img class=\"w-full\" src=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/07nN28i6iUYEKS2KZck308Q/images-1.fit_lim.size_256x.jpg\" alt=\"People sitting around table with food, cheering with glasses of wine, with flask of wine on decanter on table\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"596\" height=\"447\">\n            </a>\n            <div class=\"mt-2 leading-none text-left\">\n                                    <span class=\"subtitle-2 text-gray-600 capitalize text-xs pr-5 mt-1\">Credit: Wake Up Wine</span>\n                            </div>  \n            </div>\n    <div class=\"w-full pl-0 mt-3 md:w-2/3 md:mt-0 md:pl-8\">\n        <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/jBjpy?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall&amp;short_url=jBjpy&amp;cd36=Standard&amp;t=deals&amp;m=deal-card&amp;e=offer&amp;i=title&amp;el=offer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\" class=\"block text-xl font-bold text-secondary-300 mb-5 leading-8 text-center md:text-left hover:underline md:text-2xl\" data-ga-action=\"offer-title\" data-ga-item=\"title\" data-ga-label=\"$text\" data-ga-click data-commerce-click>WAKE UP WINE&trade; Pro S: Electronic Decanter</a>\n                    <div class=\"font-bold text-coolgray-900 font-sans text-base leading-6 text-center md:text-lg md:text-left\">$169.99 at the Mashable Shop</div>\n                <a class=\"font-bold text-center hover:underline leading-6\" href=\"https://zdcs.link/jBjpy?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall&amp;short_url=jBjpy&amp;cd36=Standard&amp;t=deals&amp;m=deal-card&amp;e=offer&amp;i=buy-button&amp;el=offer\" target=\"_blank\" data-ga-action=\"buy-link\" data-ga-item=\"buy-button\" data-ga-label=\"$text\" data-ga-click data-commerce-click> \n            <button class=\"mt-3 inline-block text-base font-bold font-sans btn btn-secondary w-full tracking-wide md:w-auto px-5 md:text-lg\">Get Deal</button>\n        </a>\n    </div>\n</div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 11 Mar 2022 10:00:00 +0000","feedId":91,"bgimg":"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/07nN28i6iUYEKS2KZck308Q/hero-image.jpg","linkMd5":"485f778cc26d53de6f86f7eaf1fb885c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn3@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-27-02-933_3731f0462cac1333.webp","destWidth":1200,"destHeight":675,"sourceBytes":411637,"destBytes":62134,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/07nN28i6iUYEKS2KZck308Q/hero-image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn3@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-27-02-933_3731f0462cac1333.webp","https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/07nN28i6iUYEKS2KZck308Q/images-1.fit_lim.size_256x.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn3@2020_2/2022/03/14/08-27-24-902_d1191b9aee63dcc3.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647246421768},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:27:01","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:27:01","title":"How to take a screenshot on an iPad","link":"https://mashable.com/article/how-to-take-screenshot-on-ipad","description":"<img src=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/02HoV7b0wPMvzUbTgGhPl8o/hero-image.jpg\" alt=\"illustration of an ipad\"><p>Taking a screenshot on iPad has been a core feature since the first generation of Apple&rsquo;s popular tablet, and for good reason.&nbsp;</p><p>Whether you want to share a Twitter thread, save a receipt, or capture a moment of a video (for the memes), screenshots are an invaluable part of how we communicate today.

The pieces weren&rsquo;t standardized until the 19th century, then came clocks and tournaments.

If you&rsquo;re looking for the best of both worlds, <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/y2rEw\">Square Off Pro</a> has come up with a chessboard that combines the old world with the new.

You can play folks face-to-face like a classic game of chess. You can play solo, against an adaptive AI, with 20 difficulty levels and a guided coach. Or you can connect with over 50 million players around the world via Chess.com and Lichess for interactive online game play. Challenge your opponent via video call and play directly on your board. Feeling the pieces in your hand, rather than moving your mouse or dragging your finger across a touch screen, feels more authentic to the game.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re <a href=\"https://mashable.com/deals/march-11-the-ultimate-beginner-to-grandmaster-chess-course-bundle\">new to chess</a> or you need some pointers, the personal interactive coach, Viktor, will guide you through your moves and warn you of errors.

And they don't \"parachute\" from the sky.</p><p>The internet is awash in news about the spread of the invasive Joro spider, a big, striking arachnid that almost certainly hitched a ride to the U.S. aboard a shipping container, as many invasive species do. Since 2013, the palm-sized animals have colonized northern Georgia, and new, important research <a href=\"https://resjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/phen.12385\">published in the science journal </a><a href=\"https://resjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/phen.12385\"><i>Physiological Entomology</i></a><i> </i>presents compelling evidence that the species will inevitably expand around the Southeast and along the Eastern Seaboard.</p><p>Crucially, these spiders may look imposing, but they aren't a dangerous menace to people. Their potential impact on the environment remains unknown. (They might even have ecological benefits.) And the sizable mature adults definitely aren't going to \"parachute\" down from the sky en mass, like something out of a low-budget horror film. </p><p>Instead, the ways Joros will often expand to new regions in the U.S. are rather mundane. </p><p>\"It's more likely one of the spiders will hitch a ride on someone's car,\" Andy Davis, an ecologist at the University of Georgia and an author of the new research, told Mashable. </p><q>\n    \"It's more likely one of the spiders will hitch a ride on someone's car.\"\n    </q>\n<p>The spider will soon colonize more areas. \"It's definitely expanding its range,\" explained Davis. He suspects the Joros will occupy pockets of the Eastern Seaboard in the next year or so, and that they'll occupy most of the Southeast in five to 10 years. </p><p>Beyond cars, the Joros will likely hitch rides on cargo incessantly moving around the U.S. \"It got here hiding in cargo,\" said Robert Furey, a spider expert at the Harrisburg University of Science and Technology.</p><p>\"Cargo moves,\" Furey, who had no role in the new research, added. \"There's nothing to stop it.\"</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <a class=\"text-gray-600\" href=\"https://twitter.com/N8Swick/status/1501579004373082114\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tweet may have been deleted</a>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"w-full mx-auto max-w-3xl font-sans mt-8 text-lg leading-loose md:text-xl md:leading-7\">\n        <span class=\"font-bold text-primary-400\">SEE ALSO:</span>\n        <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/murder-hornet-hype\" class=\"text-secondary-300\">\n            Don't buy the 'murder hornet' hype\n                            <svg class=\"ml-1 w-4 h-4 fill-current inline-block font-normal\"><use href=\"/images/icons/spritemap.svg#sprite-arrow-right-thin\"></use></svg>\n                    </a>\n    </div>\n<ul><li><p><a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/how-many-species-live-on-earth\">The number of species on Earth is uncountable</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/giant-tortoise-wilderness\">Enthralled scientists spot a giant tortoise behaving in a strange, wild way</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/will-cockroaches-inherit-earth\">Will cockroaches really inherit the Earth?</a></p></li></ul><h2>Why the spiders won't \"parachute\" down</h2><p>The claim that Joro spiders will parachute down from the sky is \"super ridiculous,\" explained David Coyle, an assistant professor of forest health and invasive species at Clemson University.</p><p>Here's what's actually happening: Some little spiders, like a young Joro spider, may choose to \"balloon.\" This means they <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDL9VxLqdvw\">release a strand of silk from their abdomen</a> and they're able to ride through the air.

That's likely why some spiders don't balloon. \"You can end up in a lake &mdash; or on the hood of a truck,\" noted Coyle. \"Your fate is not in your control anymore.\"</p><p>As the Joros expand their reach in the U.S., you shouldn't expect to see any tiny baby spiders ballooning through the woods. When little spiders ride puffs of wind, it's extremely difficult to see. \"It happens all the time,\" said Furey. \"When's the last time you noticed it?\" </p><p>Furey has never seen a ballooning spider land. \"And I spend a lot of time with spiders,\" he said. </p><h2>Are Joro spiders poisonous or threatening? </h2><p>No. Joro spiders have much better things to do than seek out, or try to harm, humans.  </p><p>\"With very few exceptions, insects and arthropods want nothing to do with you,\" said Coyle, noting the spiders' need to build webs, eat, and mate. \"They're just doing their thing. People just need to chill out. This thing isn't there to get you.\"</p><p>They are not venomous like a black widow or brown recluse. Their fangs are tiny, so it's not easy for them to bite a person (maybe if you pick one up you'll get an insignificant pinch, noted Davis). And if you disturb them, they're likely to scurry away. </p><p>\"It turns out these spiders are real wimps,\" said Davis.</p><q>\n    \"People just need to chill out. This thing isn't there to get you.\"\n    </q>\n<p>But as the Joros spread in the U.S., more people will see their big conspicuous webs in the summer, when they mature. \"Their webs are huge,\" Davis marveled. \"They're all over my backyard.\" And they'll almost certainly become a nuisance. Some people will inevitably run into these big webs, perhaps out on a walk or hike. That will be unpleasant, or startling, because their silk is exceptionally strong.</p><p>\"It's stopped me in my tracks,\" said Furey.</p><div class=\"eloquent-imagery-image\">\n    <div class=\"flex justify-center\">\n        <img class=\"border border-gray-100 h-full\" src=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/05cjQAXoS77bANZQ5xv8PJY/images-2.fit_lim.size_2000x.v1646919298.png\" alt=\"spiderwebs from Joro spiders\" srcset=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/05cjQAXoS77bANZQ5xv8PJY/images-2.fit_lim.size_800x.v1646919298.png 800w,https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/05cjQAXoS77bANZQ5xv8PJY/images-2.fit_lim.size_1400x.v1646919298.png 1400w,https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/05cjQAXoS77bANZQ5xv8PJY/images-2.fit_lim.size_2000x.v1646919298.png 1600w\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1408px) 100vw, 1408px\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1544\">\n\n\n    </div>\n            <div class=\"mt-4 subtitle-2 font-sans text-left\">\n            <span class=\"text-gray-1000 normal-case\">A cluster of big spiderwebs from the Joro spider.</span>\n            <span class=\"credit text-gray-600 capitalize\">Credit: Benjamin Frick</span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<h2>Where will the Joros spread?</h2><p>A close relative of the Joro,&nbsp;the golden silk spider, can't tolerate the cold. That's why it hasn't spread beyond the Southeast.</p><p>But how will the Joro fair? To test their vulnerability to cooler climes, researchers exposed Joros to brief freezes in the laboratory, the type that often kill golden silk spiders. The Joros survived deep freezes considerably better (74 percent survived, versus 50 percent of golden silk spiders). Their faster metabolisms and bodies worked well in colder environments, too. What's more, in their native Japan, the Joros inhabit cooler, northern climes, similar to those on the Eastern Seaboard. </p><q>\n    \"They're going to expand.\"\n    </q>\n<p>\"The Joro seems more cold tolerant,\" said Davis, an author of the research. \"It will probably be able to exist much farther than the Southeast.\"</p><p>How far, exactly, is uncertain. People have already spotted them in the likes of Tennessee, North Carolina, and South Carolina.</p><p>\"They're going to expand,\" said Furey.</p><h2>What risks do invasive Joros pose to the environment?</h2><p>It's still unknown whether Joros will have a positive, neutral, or negative impact on the environment. Some invasive species wreak havoc on native habitats or agriculture. Take, for example, the colorful spotted lanternfly, which relentlessly destroys trees and crops in parts of the U.S. (\"Squash it, smash it...just get rid of it,\" <a href=\"https://www.agriculture.pa.gov/Plants_Land_Water/PlantIndustry/Entomology/spotted_lanternfly/SpottedLanternflyAlert/Pages/default.aspx\">urges the state of Pennsylvania</a>.) </p><p>But in the early stages of the Joro expansion, ecologists and biologists simply don't have adequate proof of how the arachnids might affect the natural world. \"It's guessing at this point,\" said Davis.</p><div class=\"w-full mx-auto max-w-3xl font-sans mt-8 text-lg leading-loose md:text-xl md:leading-7\">\n        <span class=\"font-bold text-primary-400\">SEE ALSO:</span>\n        <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/giant-hornet-bees-attack-scream-like-mammals\" class=\"text-secondary-300\">\n            Bees shriek like alarmed mammals when giant hornets attack\n                            <svg class=\"ml-1 w-4 h-4 fill-current inline-block font-normal\"><use href=\"/images/icons/spritemap.svg#sprite-arrow-right-thin\"></use></svg>\n                    </a>\n    </div>\n<p>Their multiplying numbers could potentially be a boon to the environment. Hanging out in the open, Joros could become prey to the likes of lizards, birds, and wasps, Davis said. Already, there's some evidence Joros devour another problematic invasive species, the brown marmorated stink bug.</p><p>Americans will see more Joros. But will they become a curse, a blessing, or just (at times) a nuisance?</p><p>\"Only time will tell,\" said Furey.</p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 11 Mar 2022 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":91,"bgimg":"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/05cjQAXoS77bANZQ5xv8PJY/hero-image.jpg","linkMd5":"be5adbef5b54dcc9f7b7344141750765","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn99@2020_5/2022/03/14/08-27-02-013_5cffd20d7c80f6fe.webp","destWidth":683,"destHeight":512,"sourceBytes":148650,"destBytes":148650,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/05cjQAXoS77bANZQ5xv8PJY/hero-image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn99@2020_5/2022/03/14/08-27-02-013_5cffd20d7c80f6fe.webp","https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/05cjQAXoS77bANZQ5xv8PJY/images-1.fit_lim.size_2000x.v1646886495.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn91@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-27-26-312_822c4e88df7613b5.webp","https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/05cjQAXoS77bANZQ5xv8PJY/images-2.fit_lim.size_2000x.v1646919298.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn33@2020_1/2022/03/14/08-27-26-458_c657d65f5443ee97.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647246421765},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:27:01","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:27:01","title":"A rare Kate McKinnon break highlights Zoë Kravitz's hilariously cat-filled 'SNL' monologue","link":"https://mashable.com/video/zoe-kravitz-snl-monologue-kate-mckinnon-break","description":"<img src=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/videos/07xX0LQNLS1mlY93MpXyWfM/hero-image.png\" alt=\"Kate McKinnon dressed like Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman from \" batman returns standing on the main night live stage with zo kravitz host.><p>Zo&euml; Kravitz, star of <i>The Batman</i>, is only the latest actor to take on the role of the Catwoman.

When Congress adopted the NASA Authorization Act of 2010, it directed the space agency to build the rocket. </p><p>SLS is literally and figuratively founded on <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/flyout/index.html\">the Space Shuttle legacy</a>, which operated between 1981 and 2011. NASA has upgraded components of the shuttle for the new rocket, using a larger version of the shuttle stack that swaps out the legendary winged orbiter for either a cargo or crew capsule. The vehicle's core rocket stage is a stretched shuttle fuel tank, powered by four shuttle main engines. </p><p>Rather than reusing those engines, though, NASA will ditch them in the ocean during the Artemis missions. Lightening the load enables the spacecraft to get on a moonbound trajectory.</p><p>House and Senate leaders, wanting to support their space industry constituents, legally required NASA to work with all the same contractors used for the shuttle. In 2010, during the Great Recession, those lawmakers sought to preserve thousands of jobs in their districts. About 1,100 U.S. companies and employees at every NASA center are now involved in the megarocket project. </p><p>The 2010 bill even told NASA to use the old \"cost-plus contracts,\" deals that pay the contractor for all of its expenses and then some to allow for a profit (as opposed to a \"fixed cost contract\" where the total budget is set). This model doesn't create an incentive for the contractor to finish its work within a set time and budget. Despite poor performance from Boeing, for instance, NASA gave the company 86 percent of all available award fees for developing the core, Martin said, \"despite being billions over budget and years behind schedule.\" </p><p>\"NASA was told what to build and told the kind of pieces to use,\" Dreier said. \"They couldn't just start fresh.\" </p><div class=\"eloquent-imagery-image\">\n    <div class=\"flex justify-center\">\n        <img class=\"border border-gray-100 h-full\" src=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/02hxFw4vA5m4mERId9Gft4X/images-2.fit_lim.size_2000x.v1647019850.jpg\" alt=\"Boeing joining the upper part of the SLS rocket\" srcset=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/02hxFw4vA5m4mERId9Gft4X/images-2.fit_lim.size_800x.v1647019850.jpg 800w,https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/02hxFw4vA5m4mERId9Gft4X/images-2.fit_lim.size_1400x.v1647019850.jpg 1400w,https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/02hxFw4vA5m4mERId9Gft4X/images-2.fit_lim.size_2000x.v1647019850.jpg 1600w\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1408px) 100vw, 1408px\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\">\n\n\n    </div>\n            <div class=\"mt-4 subtitle-2 font-sans text-left\">\n            <span class=\"text-gray-1000 normal-case\">Despite poor performance from Boeing, NASA gave the company 86 percent of all available award fees for developing the rocket core, according to the NASA Office of Inspector General.</span>\n            <span class=\"credit text-gray-600 capitalize\">Credit: NASA</span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<q>\n    \"I know what I could do for $4.1 billion, and it's a lot.\"\n    </q>\n<p>That's a key difference between the SLS and SpaceX Starship, which isn't tethered to decades-old technology or inefficient contracts.

When <a href=\"https://spaceexplored.com/2021/11/29/spacex-raptor-crisis/\">Musk wrote to his team</a> that a crisis with the Raptor engine production on Starship threatened to bankrupt the company, skeptics of space exploration privatization pointed to it as an example of why the United States has to have its own rocket.</p><q>\n    \"You're putting the entire national goal on the whims of one company.\"\n    </q>\n<p>\"You're saying that this one privately held company that is under the sway of a very powerful, influential individual whose vision drives the company, if anything happens to him or that company, the U.S. has no assured way to get astronauts to the moon,\" Dreier said. \"You're putting the entire national goal on the whims of one company.\"</p><p>The last three <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/specials/apollo50th/missions.html\">Apollo missions</a> in the 1970s &mdash; 15, 16, and 17 &mdash; cost about $3.8 billion each when adjusted for inflation, Dreier said. That makes the Artemis missions look significantly overpriced.

The well-known advice is that you shouldn't use the same password for everything because it's not safe, but that doesn&rsquo;t make it any less annoying as you&rsquo;re mentally shifting through every password and password variation you&rsquo;ve ever created as you try to log into a bank account or online shop.</p><p>This warning to use a different password for each site is definitely true though: <a href=\"https://https//www.secureauth.com/resources/blog/2017-dbir-misuse-stolen-credentials\">According to Verizon&rsquo;s Data Breach Investigations Report</a>, 81% of hacking related breaches involved the misuse of stolen or weak credentials &mdash; AKA crappy, overused passwords. And we probably don't have to tell you this, but having your money or identity stolen isn't exactly a good time either.</p><p>But even if you do manage to come up with Olympic-level strength passwords, remembering your complex, unique passwords for dozens of different sites is nearly impossible, especially when password requirements sound more like the recipe for a potion. Uppercase letter, number, symbol, eye of newt, etc.</p><p>So before you know it, you&rsquo;ve used up your three guesses and you&rsquo;re locked out because you can&rsquo;t remember your genius combination of letters, numbers, and symbols. And now you need to create a new amazing password <i>again. </i>So you try something you think you&rsquo;ll remember and &nbsp;just like that, you get the alert that &ldquo;new password cannot be the same as old password.&rdquo;</p><p>Enter: password managers. AKA your new best friend to help keep your online accounts safe and keep <i>you </i>from tossing your device across the room every time you need to remember or create a new password.&nbsp;</p><h2><b>What does a password manager really do?</b></h2><p>The best password managers are essentially a way to safely store all your logins and passwords in a safe place.&nbsp;</p><p>All you have to do is remember one master password and then your password manager will autofill the rest for you, plus more security stuff you probably didn't even think about.</p><p>In other words, a password manager is like a secure list of passwords in your phone's notes (or a notebook, if you&rsquo;re old-school), except losing your phone or notebook won't mean that your entire life is about to be hacked.</p><p>Password managers can be apps on your mobile phone, plugins in your browser, or desktop software you install.&nbsp;</p><p>Some will also help you create, not just store, some super secure passwords that a hacker wouldn&rsquo;t be able to guess so you don&rsquo;t have to keep thinking of variations based on your pets&rsquo; or kids' names.&nbsp;</p><p>The best password managers will also allow you to secure your devices &mdash; like your Kindle or Apple Watch &mdash; and even your photos and other private documents that you won&rsquo;t want easily accessible on your computer or smartphone. Think of it as a form of personal encryption to add even more security to your digital life.</p><h2><b>Things to consider when choosing a password manager:</b></h2><ul><li><p><b>Do you want passwords to be remembered on your phone and laptop?</b> If so, you'll need to make sure the password manager allows syncing on multiple devices. (As you'll see, most free versions other than LastPass do not allow more than one device.) </p></li><li><p><b>Are you storing passwords just for personal use</b> or do you need to share with a group? Some password managers will allow you to share logins with colleagues or family without actually telling them what the password is. That will allow you to give them access to a site or platform you all use &mdash; and remove their access if you need to &mdash; without having to worry that they can share the password with people you don&rsquo;t approve. Others will allow you to set up a family account so that you and your spouse or children can share passwords easily.</p></li><li><p><b>Two-factor authentication: </b>Using the Google Authenticator app, an external device, text message, or something similar, does the password manager require a second form of insurance to make sure that it's actually you trying to log in? Without this, if someone gets ahold of your master password, they have access to all of your stuff.</p></li><li><p><b>Emergency contacts: </b>If you forget your master password, you need to make sure you're not completely screwed. Many password managers are equipped with emergency contacts, which are basically the password version of writing someone into your will. This is where you give a trusted friend, family member, or boss access to your master password in the event that you can't provide it.</p></li></ul><h2><b>What are some of the best password managers on the market?</b></h2><p>Interested in employing a password manager to help make your online life a little easier? We&rsquo;ve sifted through a whole bunch of password manager programs out there so you don&rsquo;t have to.

It&rsquo;s not much to want hot coffee to be hot &ndash; both for flavor and comfort. Because, as Barry Green, a taste perception scientist at Yale University told <u><a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/19288-room-temperature-coffee-taste.html\">Live Science</a></u>, &ldquo;hot coffee releases more aromatic compounds than room-temperature coffee&hellip;[and] milk, coffee's frequent companion, tastes worse at room temperature.&rdquo; Lukewarm coffee can ruin a morning &mdash;&nbsp;and reheating it on the stove or in the microwave does away with nearly everything good about the drink.</p><p>You can get up and make another cup, but if you&rsquo;re operating in the pour over method, that&rsquo;ll take an additional 15 minutes of labor. So, what&rsquo;s the fix? After months of struggling with this seemingly minute problem, I found a simple and affordable solution: the <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/E3Ey4\">V60 insulated server</a> from Hario, the legendary Japanese coffee and tea brand. It&rsquo;s an insulated, stainless steel server, tailor made for the <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/P25bO\">V60 pour over dripper</a> &mdash; though it works nicely with an AeroPress, and can also be used as an ordinary thermos.</p><div class=\"w-full max-w-4xl mx-auto mt-8\">\n    <div id=\"video-container-YaNZEs-4ZcE\"></div>\n</div>\n\n\n<p>As more people work from home due to the pandemic, some have purchased aspirational <a href=\"https://mashable.com/category/kitchen\">home and kitchen</a> appliances. But there&rsquo;s something to be said about the Hario server, which is practical in a turbulent time. It&rsquo;s more durable than other carafes that I&rsquo;ve had, and it&rsquo;s sleek and ergonomic with a double-wall interior. It&rsquo;ll make your routine all the better because you&rsquo;ll have fresh coffee well into the afternoon.</p><h2>Testing the V60</h2><p>I tested the coffee temperature inside my Hario server in intervals of 30 minutes after using my preferred brewing method: the pour over (which is demonstrated in the above video). Simply place a dripper directly on the carafe&rsquo;s opening &mdash; or if you&rsquo;re using an AeroPress, throw that on top instead. After brewing you&rsquo;ll want to tightly seal the lid back on the carafe.&nbsp;</p><div class=\"eloquent-imagery-image\">\n    <div class=\"flex justify-center\">\n        <img class=\"sm:object-scale-down h-full mx-auto\" src=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/reviews/07sSKDlILO33Y44bxsGfD2a/images-1.fit_lim.size_2000x.v1646853239.jpg\" alt=\"Hario coffee server with coffee dripper on top\" srcset=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/reviews/07sSKDlILO33Y44bxsGfD2a/images-1.fit_lim.size_800x.v1646853239.jpg 800w,https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/reviews/07sSKDlILO33Y44bxsGfD2a/images-1.fit_lim.size_1400x.v1646853239.jpg 1400w,https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/reviews/07sSKDlILO33Y44bxsGfD2a/images-1.fit_lim.size_2000x.v1646853239.jpg 1600w\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1408px) 100vw, 1408px\" width=\"2000\" height=\"2665\">\n\n\n    </div>\n            <div class=\"mt-4 subtitle-2 font-sans max-w-3xl text-center mx-auto\">\n            <span class=\"text-gray-1000 normal-case\">The Hario V60 server is designed to work seamlessly with the Hario V60 coffee dripper.</span>\n            <span class=\"credit text-gray-600 capitalize\">Credit: Harrison Malkin/Mashable</span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>I used a full serving of coffee (600 milliliters) and made sure not to fiddle with the switch and gasket, because that keeps it vacuum sealed. I also preheated my mug upon first serving,&nbsp;which I think is a great idea in the winter time. If your mug is frozen, the benefits of the server will diminish and the temperature of your coffee will decrease. But with my second and third pouring, I was lazy and drank it straight.</p><p>When I checked in at the 30-minute mark, the temperature was nearly unchanged from the initial brewing. And after 90 minutes, my coffee was still hot and delicious when I poured a cup with my lunch of roasted veggies and an open-faced sandwich. Stainless steel servers rely on the beverage&rsquo;s original heat, unlike a hot plate, so you don&rsquo;t get that odd burnt aroma or taste.</p><p>Hours later, when I got home from the gym, I unexpectedly found the coffee warm enough to still drink &mdash; that was an added bonus with my post-workout snack. Having hot coffee for this long is ideal, and longer than what I was used to when I had the glass Hario server.&nbsp;</p><p>That glass carafe actually shattered when it fell on my kitchen floor, so the stainless steel model is an improvement in durability and utility. However, my current server does lose points for heaviness and clunkiness compared to the glass one. It can feel wonky to pour because coffee leaks into the back of the server, and you need to turn the carafe upside down to get every drop.&nbsp;</p><h2>Cleaning it&nbsp;</h2><div class=\"eloquent-imagery-image\">\n    <div class=\"flex justify-center\">\n        <img class=\"border border-gray-100 h-full\" src=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/reviews/07sSKDlILO33Y44bxsGfD2a/images-2.fit_lim.size_2000x.v1646858967.jpg\" alt=\"metal server sitting on wood surface\" srcset=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/reviews/07sSKDlILO33Y44bxsGfD2a/images-2.fit_lim.size_800x.v1646858967.jpg 800w,https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/reviews/07sSKDlILO33Y44bxsGfD2a/images-2.fit_lim.size_1400x.v1646858967.jpg 1400w,https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/reviews/07sSKDlILO33Y44bxsGfD2a/images-2.fit_lim.size_2000x.v1646858967.jpg 1600w\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1408px) 100vw, 1408px\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\">\n\n\n    </div>\n            <div class=\"mt-4 subtitle-2 font-sans text-left\">\n            <span class=\"text-gray-1000 normal-case\">The Hario coffee server is durable, but a little difficult to clean.</span>\n            <span class=\"credit text-gray-600 capitalize\">Credit: Harrison Malkin/Mashable</span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>The server&rsquo;s interior gets coffee stains and a metallic odor easily, so I recommend cleaning it a few times per week. A quick rinse with hot water will do, but for a more holistic cleaning, it&rsquo;s best to use a mixture of hot water and baking soda or dish soap. Although, it&rsquo;s difficult to scrub the interior, and the lid is tricky to wash completely because it cannot be disassembled.</p><h2>Is the server worth buying?&nbsp;</h2><p>I've owned this server for about a year and it's a staple in my coffee-making process &mdash; along with my beans (often from <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/Lx7nO\">ModCup</a> or <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/y2rw2\">Black River</a>), <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/bZknr\">Stagg EKG kettle</a>, and <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/pVn6l\">Escali Primo scale</a>. I bought the 600-milliliter version, which is nice because it doesn&rsquo;t take up much counter space. The only downside is that it&rsquo;s too tiny if you&rsquo;re making coffee for multiple guests.&nbsp;The server is also available in an 800-milliliter option. Whichever size, the <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/E3Ey4\">Hario insulated server</a> is practical and affordable, and will be a worthwhile long-term investment for those looking to extend that perfect coffee taste.</p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Sat, 12 Mar 2022 10:00:00 +0000","feedId":91,"bgimg":"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/reviews/07sSKDlILO33Y44bxsGfD2a/hero-image.jpg","linkMd5":"7beb74d20f5a77f3854899c251e63d4b","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn91@2020_5/2022/03/14/08-27-02-716_6077b720fcf1fe54.webp","destWidth":1920,"destHeight":1080,"sourceBytes":389052,"destBytes":389052,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/reviews/07sSKDlILO33Y44bxsGfD2a/hero-image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn91@2020_5/2022/03/14/08-27-02-716_6077b720fcf1fe54.webp","https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/reviews/07sSKDlILO33Y44bxsGfD2a/images-1.fit_lim.size_2000x.v1646853239.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn43@2020_1/2022/03/14/08-27-24-850_83d969c710c6b61c.webp","https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/reviews/07sSKDlILO33Y44bxsGfD2a/images-2.fit_lim.size_2000x.v1646858967.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn68@2020_3/2022/03/14/08-27-24-845_9bf020a0c6ac6364.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647246421753},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:27:01","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:27:01","title":"Samuel L.

For many, puberty hits hard, transforming our bodies into strange creatures we no longer recognize. Our limbs stretch; our curves swell. A natural musk blooms from our skin. We grow hair in places where there was no hair before. And our emotions attack in a wild rush. For Meilin \"Mei\" Lee, the heroine of the latest Disney/Pixar movie, <i>Turning Red</i>, all of this is true, <i>also,</i> she turns into a giant red panda. This cuddly cute shape-shift is a metaphor for puberty that's bold, bonkers, and totally brilliant &mdash; while being a boatload of fun.&nbsp;</p><p>Co-written and directed by Domee Shi, <a href=\"https://mashable.com/video/pixar-turning-red-trailer\"><i>Turning Red</i></a><a href=\"https://mashable.com/video/pixar-turning-red-trailer\"> </a>is set in 2002 Toronto, where 13-year-old Mei (Rosalie Chiang) is a straight-A student with a bit of a double life. With her Chinese-Canadian family, she is a devoted daughter, volunteering at their temple, helping with dinner, and ever-poised and polite. With her friends, she's a headstrong goofball who loves karaoke, boy bands, and imagining her crushes as mermen. With these dueling identities, Shi and co-writer Julia Cho set the child that Mei is to her parents against the young woman she's becoming. When the pressure to be perfect for her mom and her friends becomes too much, Mei transforms into a towering, fluffy red panda.&nbsp;</p><h2><i><b>Turning Red </b></i><b>brings back to the poppy fun of the 2000s</b></h2><p>Steeped in 2000s nostalgia, this transformation is less traumatizing and more terrific, making Mei as cute and appealing as her Tamagochi virtual pet. With flip-phones and old-school emojis, she and her friends find the fun to be had in her panda. But to her mother, this \"gross red monster\" is a shameful secret that must be hidden, suppressed, and banished with the blood moon. As the moon approaches, so does the concert date for Mei and her friends' favorite boy band, 4 Town. And so comes a showdown full of panda action, mother-daughter drama, and deliciously catchy pop music (written by Billie Eilish and Finneas).&nbsp;</p><div class=\"eloquent-imagery-image\">\n    <div class=\"flex justify-center\">\n        <img class=\"border border-gray-100 h-full\" src=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/01NZEuVj0eidqvgWW4gmfmC/images-3.fit_lim.size_2000x.v1646257376.jpg\" alt=\"A mom looks at her young daughter's notebook; both look alarmed. \" srcset=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/01NZEuVj0eidqvgWW4gmfmC/images-3.fit_lim.size_800x.v1646257376.jpg 800w,https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/01NZEuVj0eidqvgWW4gmfmC/images-3.fit_lim.size_1400x.v1646257376.jpg 1400w,https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/01NZEuVj0eidqvgWW4gmfmC/images-3.fit_lim.size_2000x.v1646257376.jpg 1600w\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1408px) 100vw, 1408px\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\">\n\n\n    </div>\n            <div class=\"mt-4 subtitle-2 font-sans text-left\">\n            <span class=\"text-gray-1000 normal-case\"></span>\n            <span class=\"credit text-gray-600 capitalize\">Credit: Disney / Pixar</span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<h2><b>Kids and grown-ups will love </b><i><b>Turning Red</b></i></h2><p>Panda aside, Mei's journey to young womanhood is similar to those seen in cringe-comedies like <a href=\"https://mashable.com/video/eighth-grade-pool-party-clip-exclusive\"><i>Eighth Grade,</i></a><i> </i><a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/pen15-season-2-review\"><i>Pen15</i></a>, and <i>Bob's Burgers</i>' Tina Belcher plot lines. All possess a deep empathy for the harried heroine, who is flustered, awkward, and frantically horny. Their fumbles and foibles make us laugh not at them, but at ourselves way back then. <i>Turning Red</i> is less cringe-inducing than its thematic sisters, thanks to the '00s pop-optimism, vivid color palette, and Pixar's kid-friendly polish. Whether Mei is feeling insecure about her body, fighting with her mother, or fantasizing about a cute boy, the vibe is more romp than recoil. This is a genius move by Shi. Because while parents (and child-free grown-ups) will relish the nostalgia for the '00s in aesthetic and perhaps personal naivete, actual kids won't feel the crushing weight of all that cringe. <i>That</i> comes later, be it through age, wisdom, or therapy (or all three).</p><p>Kids won't put together what Mei's mom (an apoplectic Sandra Oh) means when she asks if daughter's \"red peony has bloomed.\" The central metaphor will go over their heads, as will the reason Mei's mom reacts so intensely when she discovers a notebook swamped in steamy doodles. To youngsters, this will be a bouncy story about a girl fighting for her right to grow up, find her own identity, and rock out with her best friends. More importantly, they'll get to see a group of girls who don't fit the typical Disney/Pixar heroine mold not only be heroes but also be loved just as they are.&nbsp;</p><div class=\"eloquent-imagery-image\">\n    <div class=\"flex justify-center\">\n        <img class=\"border border-gray-100 h-full\" src=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/01NZEuVj0eidqvgWW4gmfmC/images-2.fit_lim.size_2000x.v1646257376.jpg\" alt=\"Four young girls dance in a goofy way. \" srcset=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/01NZEuVj0eidqvgWW4gmfmC/images-2.fit_lim.size_800x.v1646257376.jpg 800w,https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/01NZEuVj0eidqvgWW4gmfmC/images-2.fit_lim.size_1400x.v1646257376.jpg 1400w,https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/01NZEuVj0eidqvgWW4gmfmC/images-2.fit_lim.size_2000x.v1646257376.jpg 1600w\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1408px) 100vw, 1408px\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\">\n\n\n    </div>\n            <div class=\"mt-4 subtitle-2 font-sans text-left\">\n            <span class=\"text-gray-1000 normal-case\"></span>\n            <span class=\"credit text-gray-600 capitalize\">Credit: Disney / Pixar</span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<h2><b>Mei breaks the mold of Disney heroines</b></h2><p>Forget the flawless and poised princesses of Disney past, who get ball gowns and sea creature serenades in their quests for romance. Mei is not crushing on princes, but those pretty boys of elementary school, who'd toss their long floppy bangs with no idea how it made our hearts skip a beat. (Shi re-creating exactly this move in slo-mo is dead-on and divine.)&nbsp;</p><p>Mei doesn't make pretty smiles or flirty lip bites when she swoons. Her face contorts in a way typically denied Disney's female characters. It's a face that's not cute but is crucial to expressing that juvenile pang of lust that's so abrupt and confounding that your face basically short-circuits. Even in these moments, Mei's got her girls, each of whom is a familiar yet distinct brand of 8th-grade awkward. Always a booster, Miriam (Ava Morse) is enthusiastic but a bit oblivious. Priya (<a href=\"https://in.mashable.com/entertainment/28286/turning-red-maitreyi-ramakrishnan-on-diversity-and-female-friendships-in-the-pixar-film\">Maitreyi Ramakrishnan</a>)&nbsp;is steadily chill, but will give in for a dance break. Abby (Hyein Park) is a girly girl who loves pink, flowers, and fluffy friends, but also will punch you in the face with a moment's notice. Just like the red panda, they break the mold on what being a girl means in a Disney movie. They do it with verve and style &mdash;&nbsp;and we love them for all of it.&nbsp;</p><div class=\"w-full mx-auto max-w-3xl font-sans mt-8 text-lg leading-loose md:text-xl md:leading-7\">\n        <span class=\"font-bold text-primary-400\">SEE ALSO:</span>\n        <a href=\"https://mashable.com/video/turning-red-pixar\" class=\"text-secondary-300\">\n            'Turning Red''s creators on how the coming of age Pixar film captures teen angst\n                            <svg class=\"ml-1 w-4 h-4 fill-current inline-block font-normal\"><use href=\"/images/icons/spritemap.svg#sprite-arrow-right-thin\"></use></svg>\n                    </a>\n    </div>\n<h2><b>A coming-of-age tale that shows maturity in the Disney/Pixar brand</b></h2><p>I could go on and on about the joys of <i>Turning Red</i>, from the visual gags of bunny slippers crushed under big panda feet to the concert merch that becomes a pivotal prop. There's the rollicking pace that makes the movie feel like a roller coaster, full of swerves and thrills. The soundtrack is both throwback and self-aware, nudging at the message while gently parodying boy band jams <i>while</i> being an undeniable bop. The wealth of '00s details will amuse kids but will pitch grown-ups full-bodied back into the era of choker necklaces, flannel fashion, and emo kids. The jubilant animation builds a world familiar yet fresh, perfect for a perplexed giant red panda running amuck. Led by Chiang, the voice cast is sensational, bringing to life characters who get to be cranky, frantic, caring, and occasionally \"kind of a perv.\" But the most remarkable thing about this movie is how it marks a maturity for Disney animation.&nbsp;</p><div class=\"eloquent-imagery-image\">\n    <div class=\"flex justify-center\">\n        <img class=\"border border-gray-100 h-full\" src=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/01NZEuVj0eidqvgWW4gmfmC/images-1.fit_lim.size_2000x.v1646257376.jpg\" alt=\"A little bespectacled girl walks down a Toronto street. \" srcset=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/01NZEuVj0eidqvgWW4gmfmC/images-1.fit_lim.size_800x.v1646257376.jpg 800w,https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/01NZEuVj0eidqvgWW4gmfmC/images-1.fit_lim.size_1400x.v1646257376.jpg 1400w,https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/01NZEuVj0eidqvgWW4gmfmC/images-1.fit_lim.size_2000x.v1646257376.jpg 1600w\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1408px) 100vw, 1408px\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\">\n\n\n    </div>\n            <div class=\"mt-4 subtitle-2 font-sans text-left\">\n            <span class=\"text-gray-1000 normal-case\"></span>\n            <span class=\"credit text-gray-600 capitalize\">Credit: Disney / Pixar</span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>For decades, Disney sold little girls polished princess fantasies to sell toys.

The 6.1-inch iPhone 13 and the 5.4-inch iPhone 13 mini won tech reporter Stan Schroeder over with their improved battery life, starting storage capacity of 128GB, and \"cool\" new Cinematic camera mode, and wound up taking home a Mashable's Choice Award.

These upgrades \"won't transform your life,\" cautioned deputy tech editor Joseph Volpe, but if you're really into photography (and have some cash to spare), those cameras are a serious flex.

obsessive about the things we love. You may say we kind of geek out about things. Okay, fine, we are geeks. We're not bothered by this, because geeks are awesome.</p><p>Dating as a geek requires combing through normies and too much dating through the same group of locals. This is where dating sites can help.</p><h2><b>What are the benefits of using a dating site?</b></h2><p>Even the most awesome geeks can use a bit of assistance in the dating department. Not because there aren't enough geeks out there, but because dating as a geek is tough. For <a href=\"https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-dating-sites-women-uk\">women</a>, it can involve a lot of creepy guys who want their manic pixie dream girl. For <a href=\"https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-dating-sites-for-men-uk\">men</a>, it can involve a lot of simply trying to not be that guy. If you're in the majority of geeks who are a little bit <a href=\"https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-dating-sites-for-introverts-uk\">introverted</a>, dating can be really intimidating.</p><p>News flash: Loving sci-fi and being madly in love are not mutually exclusive, and success stories from dating sites prove this. You can still find love out there in the real world, but subscribing to a dating site shortens your odds of making a connection.</p><h2><b>Should you consider free dating apps?</b></h2><p>The good news is that there are plenty of free dating sites and apps out there, and the likes of Tinder and Hinge are seriously popular options with huge networks of users. Most of the biggest and best dating sites also offer free versions of their services (with limitations on certain features). You can easily enter the online dating game without spending anything, but sometimes free apps simply don't cut it.</p><p>You get what you pay for with dating sites and apps. For the best experience with the greatest possibility of finding exactly what you're looking for, you are going to dig a little deeper in your pockets. The best dating sites don't come cheap, and whilst you can still find a hookup with a free app, you should upgrade is you're looking for compatibility tests, chat rooms, videos, and a greater level of control.</p><h2><b>What is the best dating site for geeks?</b></h2><p>We have compared all of the internet's top dating sites, trendy swiping apps, and geek-specific sites to find the ones where geeks can express themselves and find that special someone. Hidden in the millions of users, you could find that person who hated the <u><a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/game-of-thrones-finale-fan-reactions\"><i>Game of Throne</i></a></u><u><a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/game-of-thrones-finale-fan-reactions\">s</a></u> ending as much as you, or someone who dreams of the perfect couples cosplay. Maybe you're a geek in the streets and a freak in the sheets &mdash;&nbsp;there are plenty of apps where geeks can just find a <u><a href=\"https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-hookup-apps-uk\">hookup</a></u>, too.</p><p>In terms of general dating sites, we really like Match, which has a tried-and-true algorithm and huge user base. Geek-specific dating sites that aren't totally outdated are few and far between, but we were impressed by Gamer Dating. We've checked out everything on offer and lined up a handpicked selection of the best dating options for geeks and nerds, including popular services like <a href=\"https://r.zdbb.net/u/b0yl\">Match</a>, <a href=\"https://r.zdbb.net/u/76yf\">eharmony</a>, and <a href=\"https://r.zdbb.net/u/b12r\">AdultFriendFinder</a>.</p><p>These are the best online dating sites for geeks and nerds in 2022.</p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 10 Mar 2022 12:22:11 +0000","feedId":91,"bgimg":"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/roundups/03KUjp3tFeCfdTinI1gxGIh/hero-image.png","linkMd5":"ac26fa78c89eb77d8d0acd1d50548874","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn42@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-27-03-659_97f7dae9ab35684a.webp","destWidth":5000,"destHeight":2812,"sourceBytes":7343093,"destBytes":473442,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/roundups/03KUjp3tFeCfdTinI1gxGIh/hero-image.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn42@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-27-03-659_97f7dae9ab35684a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647246421777},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:27:01","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:27:01","title":"Jennifer Garner and Greg Kinnear teaching James Corden to trash talk goes from bad to worse","link":"https://mashable.com/video/jennifer-garner-greg-kinnear-james-corden-trash-talk","description":"<img src=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/videos/024GKe40dXw6hlcAPhdveYy/hero-image.jpg\" alt=\"Jennifer Garner, Greg Kinnear, James Corden sit in the bleachers wearing team colours and calling out trash talk.\"><p>How do you strike the delicate balance between trash talk that's far too tame, and trash talk that's far too aggressive?</p><p>That's the quandary at heart of the silly <i>Late Late Show</i> sketch above, which sees Jennifer Garner and Greg Kinnear teaming up to teach James Corden how to fire an appropriate zinger from the sidelines of a basketball game.</p><p>Needless to say, he doesn't quite manage to strike the balance.</p><h2>Want more?</h2><ul><li><p><a href=\"https://mashable.com/video/michelle-obama-james-corden-celebrity-dodgeball\">Michelle Obama takes on James Corden in a celebrity-packed dodgeball game</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://mashable.com/video/james-corden-wheels-vs-doors\">Wheels vs. doors: James Corden and his staff's debate gets very heated, very fast</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://mashable.com/video/james-corden-nfl-players-dancing\">James Corden attempts to teach NFL players how to twerk and slow dance and it's a sight to behold</a></p></li></ul>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 11 Mar 2022 10:58:43 +0000","feedId":91,"bgimg":"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/videos/024GKe40dXw6hlcAPhdveYy/hero-image.jpg","linkMd5":"b9e31425201afcbd18741f497a24519d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn65@2020_1/2022/03/14/08-27-03-652_b0b76e67f45af418.webp","destWidth":1920,"destHeight":1080,"sourceBytes":290931,"destBytes":137136,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/videos/024GKe40dXw6hlcAPhdveYy/hero-image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn65@2020_1/2022/03/14/08-27-03-652_b0b76e67f45af418.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647246421766},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:27:01","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:27:01","title":"Peloton finally connects with your Apple Watch","link":"https://mashable.com/article/peloton-apple-watch-integration","description":"<img src=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/05cfOvpRZiJbHoFdVDmT38d/hero-image.png\" alt=\"apple watch with peloton app\"><p>Peloton obsessives, fire up <a href=\"https://mashable.com/category/apple-watch\">your Apple Watches</a> &mdash; or maybe go out and get one.

Search engine DuckDuckGo is the latest platform to take measures in the information war that's being battled online.</p><p>According to DuckDuckGo's founder and CEO, Gabriel Weinberg, the privacy-focused search engine has \"down-ranked\" websites in its search results that are \"associated with Russian disinformation.\"</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <a class=\"text-gray-600\" href=\"https://twitter.com/yegg/status/1501716484761997318?s=21\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tweet may have been deleted</a>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\"Like so many others I am sickened by Russia&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine and the gigantic humanitarian crisis it continues to create. #StandWithUkraine&#65039;,\" Weinberg wrote in a tweet thread on his personal Twitter account explaining DuckDuckGo's actions.</p><p>To those unfamiliar with DuckDuckGo, the move may not feel too out of the ordinary. Social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter have updated their policies to <u><a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/social-media-misinformation-ukraine-russia\">deal with disinformation</a></u> about Russia's war. Search engines like <u><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/28/google-facebook-battle-to-stop-spread-of-russian-disinformation.html\">Google</a></u> and even <u><a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/618016/microsoft-pulls-russia-news-sources-rt-from-bing-start.html\">Microsoft's Bing</a></u> have taken actions against disinformation, too.</p><p>However, the overwhelming response to Weinberg's tweets about the \"down-rankings\" has been outrage from DuckDuckGo's user base. Some even claim to have already changed their default search engine preference due to this decision.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <a class=\"text-gray-600\" href=\"https://twitter.com/AdamantPluto/status/1501772591211687936\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tweet may have been deleted</a>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\"Can you see how swiftly most of your user base has been put off by this announcement?\" reads a <u><a href=\"https://twitter.com/AdamantPluto/status/1501772591211687936\">reply</a></u> from @AdamantPluto. \"Loyal long time supporters are talking about abandoning the service.

Let us make our own calls about that.\"</p><p>Whenever the topic of alternative online platforms comes up, the focus is usually on social media services like <u><a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/trump-truth-social-free-speech-bans\">so-called</a></u> \"free speech\" networks <u><a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/inside-truth-social-trump-social-network-tour\">Truth Social</a></u> or <u><a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/gettr-hacked\">Gettr</a></u>. Yet perhaps the most successful alternative to Big Tech platforms is actually DuckDuckGo, which was founded in 2008 as an alternative to the big search engine giants like Google. The company has always focused on privacy and emphasized user privacy. </p><p>According to the <i>New York Times</i>, DuckDuckGo currently makes up around <u><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/23/technology/duckduckgo-conspiracy-theories.html\">3 percent</a></u> of the U.S. search engine market share. The service's growth points to a strong interest from users looking for a more privacy-oriented search platform. DuckDuckGo says it currently has a U.S. user base of 30 million people from all across the political spectrum. However, it has also gained traction over the past few years as <u><a href=\"https://www.inputmag.com/culture/duckduckgo-more-misinformation-than-google-conspiracy-theories\">conspiracy theorists</a></u> and far-right internet users sought out alternative online platforms as a response to Big Tech companies' content moderation policies.</p><p>Unlike most other recent alternative platforms, though, DuckDuckGo was not built to placate users with a certain political ideology. Still, DuckDuckGo has found themselves lumped in with those platforms just by <i>being </i>an alternative platform in this day and age. So, whether DuckDuckGo likes it or not, many of those types of users have adopted the search engine.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <a class=\"text-gray-600\" href=\"https://twitter.com/JasonHayward87/status/1501720436224241666\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tweet may have been deleted</a>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\"The whole point of DuckDuckGo is for you to NOT do that,\" <u><a href=\"https://twitter.com/JasonHayward87/status/1501720436224241666\">replied</a></u> @JasonHayward87 to the DuckDuckGo down-rankings announcement.</p><p>\"So the one thing that differentiates you from Google's uselessly politicized search - you're binning that,\" <u><a href=\"https://twitter.com/MorganColeBooks/status/1501801221270777856\">complained</a></u> another user, @MorganColeBooks.</p><p>Weinberg responded to the previous reply on Twitter.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <a class=\"text-gray-600\" href=\"https://twitter.com/yegg/status/1501733167291674627\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tweet may have been deleted</a>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\"The whole point of DuckDuckGo is privacy,\" he stated. \"The whole point of the search engine is to show more relevant content over less relevant content, and that is what we continue to do.\"</p><p>Privacy and data collection policies don't necessarily mean content policies. DuckDuckGo itself, however, has marketed the fact that its search engine results don't create a content \"filter bubble\" that's often found with personalized search results based on users' data.</p><p>DuckDuckGo's dedication to and frequent advertisement of its \"<u><a href=\"https://twitter.com/DuckDuckGo/status/1114524914227253249\">unbiased results</a></u>\" &ndash; again, based on its privacy policies &ndash; have caused confusion among its user base after this most recent action.&nbsp;</p><p>When it comes to content policies <i>unrelated</i> to user data, DuckDuckGo has actually moderated its search results before. The search engine already bans <u><a href=\"https://www.webpronews.com/duckduckgo-follows-content-farm-banning-with-promoting-wikihow-content/\">content farms</a></u> on its platform due to the low-quality content often found on these websites.</p><p>DuckDuckGo is also often beholden to the content policies of Big Tech search engines, because that's where it actually gets its search results. For example, when the infamous \"Tank Man\" Chinese protest photo temporarily <u><a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/microsoft-bing-tank-man\">disappeared</a></u> from Bing last year, the photo stopped appearing in DuckDuckGo's search results as well.</p><p>These nuances don't appear to affect how DuckDuckGo's users feel about Weinberg's announcement. At the time this piece was published, Weinberg's tweet about the \"down-rank\" has been replied to more than 10,000 times and received over 3,000 quote tweets. The tweet has less than 600 retweets. In Twitter lingo, this is called being \"<u><a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/chris-cilizza-twitter-ratio\">ratioed</a></u>\" &ndash; when a tweet receives more replies than shares, signaling the broader Twitter user base is not in agreement with what's being said.</p><p>In addition to down-ranking certain websites, Weinberg also <a href=\"https://twitter.com/yegg/status/1501717193855283201\">announced</a> that DuckDuckGo would display \"news modules and information boxes\" pointing users to \"quality information\" for certain breaking topics. Many platforms like Facebook and YouTube already provide a similar features. Google calls them \"knowledge panels\" on its search engine. However, this feature doesn't seem to have caused an uproar like DuckDuckGo's down-rankings have.</p><p>Mashable has reached out to DuckDuckGo for comment. We will update this piece when we hear back.</p><p class=\"mx-auto\">\n   <em><strong>UPDATE: Mar. 10, 2022, 2:35 p.m. EST </strong>A DuckDuckGo spokesperson provided Mashable with a statement regarding its decision to \"down-rank\" Russian disinformation websites.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\"The primary utility of a search engine is to provide access to accurate information,\" writes a DuckDuckGo spokesperson. \"Disinformation sites that deliberately put out false information to intentionally mislead people directly cut against that utility...We are simply using the fact that these sites are engaging in active disinformation campaigns as a ranking signal that the content they produce is of lower quality, just like there are signals for spammy sites and other lower-quality content.\"</p><p>As mentioned earlier, this isn't the first time DuckDuckGo has moderated for quality. And as <a href=\"https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/duckduckgo-yandex-ukraine\">Protocol</a> covered earlier this month, it's also not the first time DuckDuckGo has taken action regarding Russia's war in Ukraine. The company has recently \"paused\" its partnership with the Russian search engine Yandex. DuckDuckGo was using the service's results for some of its search queries in certain countries.</p><p>DuckDuckGo's full statement as provided to Mashable can be found below:</p><blockquote><p><i>The primary utility of a search engine is to provide access to accurate information. Disinformation sites that deliberately put out false information to intentionally mislead people directly cut against that utility. Current examples are Russian state-sponsored media sites like RT and Sputnik. It's also important to note that down-ranking is different from censorship. We are simply using the fact that these sites are engaging in active disinformation campaigns as a ranking signal that the content they produce is of lower quality, just like there are signals for spammy sites and other lower-quality content. In addition to this approach, for newsworthy topics we're also continuing to highlight reputable news coverage and reliable &ldquo;instant answers&rdquo; at the top of our search results where they are seen and clicked the most. We're also in the process of thinking about other types of interventions.&nbsp;</i></p></blockquote><p></p><p class=\"mx-auto\">\n   <em><strong>UPDATE: Mar. 10, 2022, 3:33 p.m. EST </strong>Additional information from DuckDuckGo has been added to the piece regarding its U.S. user base stats and why people use the platform.</em>\n</p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 10 Mar 2022 18:32:13 +0000","feedId":91,"bgimg":"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/06rFJVPLAvqxYgVFJM9N59W/hero-image.jpg","linkMd5":"6877bc30d170a65e6ed3208cfffe4ae4","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn46@2020_5/2022/03/14/08-27-03-521_2995c1301e247099.webp","destWidth":4917,"destHeight":3278,"sourceBytes":1477384,"destBytes":1477384,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/06rFJVPLAvqxYgVFJM9N59W/hero-image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn46@2020_5/2022/03/14/08-27-03-521_2995c1301e247099.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647246421772},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:27:01","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:27:01","title":"Try this streaming-friendly VPN risk-free for 45 days","link":"https://mashable.com/uk/deals/best-free-trial-vpn","description":"<img src=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/05eT1zoiFunpkv9OE01gFGO/hero-image.jpg\" alt=\"Lit up laptop in dark room\"><p><b>SAVE 82%:</b> CyberGhost VPN is a streaming-friendly service that offers plenty of advanced security features.

Otherwise, the method is essentially a random \"hope this works\" pattern that covers less than the side-by-side lines you would probably do if you were the one controlling the vacuum. Though the robots try to hit every spot with this method, they're bound to miss every now and then.</p><p>Regardless, one thing to ask yourself is: Are you currently vacuuming your floors <i>every day</i>? Because robot vacuums can do that. Even if they miss a spot one day, they might catch it the next, leading to an overall increase in floor cleanliness. </p><h2>Are robot vacuums better for hardwood floors or carpet?</h2><p>Given the velcro-like grasp that carpets can have on daily droppings, most robot vacuums perform better on hardwood than on carpet. All robot vacuums have a main suction system and side brushes that push dry debris (crumbs, kitty litter, dirt) into the line of suction. Not all of them have impressive brush rolls or the sheer suction power to rake carpet threads, though, <a href=\"https://mashable.com/roundup/best-robot-vacuums-for-carpet\">which are a necessity for cleaning carpets</a>.</p><p>Sucking up hair (human or <a href=\"https://mashable.com/roundup/best-robot-vacuums-pet-hair\">pet</a>) is easier for robot vacuums on hard flooring because on carpet, the vacuums have to really be able to dig deep and pull up hair embedded in the fibers. On smooth floors, the hair has nothing to get stuck on. If you have both carpet and hard flooring, most robot vacuums automatically adjust between floor types, lowering or raising to get the closest clean possible.</p><h2>What about hard floors that aren't wood?</h2><p>Laminate floors, tile floors, and any other kind of hard, bare floors can get the same treatment as wood floors. Robot vacuums that work well on hardwood floors will also do a good job on these floors.</p><h2>Do robot vacuums scratch hardwood floors?</h2><p>Robot vacuums are purposefully are designed to work on hardwood floors without scratching them. They have rubber wheels and gentle rubber brushes that pull in dirt without gnawing at your floors.</p><p>Where you might get floor scratching is if an abrasive piece of sand, glass, rock, etc. gets caught under the wheel and drags throughout the house. This is pretty uncommon, but to be safe, make sure your floors are clear of any large, sharp debris before running the robot vacuum.</p><h2>Are robot mops safe for hardwood floors?</h2><p>Any avowed hardwood floor enthusiast is likely to be just as meticulous about dried shoe prints or wine spills as they are about dust and debris. A robot mop's light wet scrub offers a satisfying shine to a robot vacuum's dry sweep, especially if your hardcore mopping sessions with real hardwood cleaner are few and far between.</p><p>Many robot mops (especially hybrid robot vacuum-robot mop models, like the ones listed below) only mop with water, alleviating concerns about topcoat-damaging ingredients like vinegar, ammonia, or other alkaline products. Instructions typically strongly advise against adding any type of soap to the water tank to avoid messing with the vacuum's interior parts.</p><p>Here are our top picks for the best robot vacuums for wood floors in 2022:</p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 11 Mar 2022 15:58:49 +0000","feedId":91,"bgimg":"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/roundups/06Hlr4KYWtucB5fpC8tKf0O/hero-image.jpg","linkMd5":"9e88c9ce3fb1ee70ac2ce3a3f9669bad","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn11@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-27-02-734_cf540621ae102f81.webp","destWidth":2560,"destHeight":800,"sourceBytes":387478,"destBytes":387478,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/roundups/06Hlr4KYWtucB5fpC8tKf0O/hero-image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn11@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-27-02-734_cf540621ae102f81.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647246421762},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:27:01","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:27:01","title":"Megan Thee Stallion x Dua Lipa video is a terrifying Georgia O'Keeffe acid trip","link":"https://mashable.com/video/megan-thee-stallion-dua-lipa-sweetest-pie","description":"<img src=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/videos/05lKfPMAzkhZAEnLSDrS4CL/hero-image.png\" alt=\"Dua Lipa and Megan Thee Stallion lie entwined on a burning wasteland.\"><p>It's a musical collaboration of our wildest dreams: Dua Lipa and Megan Thee Stallion. </p><p>And the music video for \"Sweetest Pie\" is exactly the magical dreamscape you'd expect of these two powerhouses. </p><p>Directed by Dave Meyers and conceptualised by Megan Thee Stallion, the video sees Megan and Dua in various trippy fantasy scenes, fighting off scores of male suitors with murderous intent. </p><p>There's Salvador Dal&iacute;-esqe imagery, for instance, Dua Lipa removing a section of her own face and revealing that it's a slice of sweet pie.

Liza Winship, Uber&rsquo;s head of driver operations for the U.S. and Canada, said in the announcement that Uber was hoping to reduce this burden. </p><p>\"While earnings on our platform remain elevated compared to historical trends, the recent spike in gas prices has affected rideshare and delivery drivers,\" Winship wrote. Gas prices in the United States have hit <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/03/09/gas-prices-going-up-russia-ukraine/\">an average of $4.30</a>, breaking records set before the 2008 financial crisis. </p><p>So Uber, which doesn't cover the cost of gas for its drivers, is asking riders to pitch in. The exact cost of surcharges will depend on your location and state price increases, ranging from either $0.45 or $0.55 on Uber rides and either $0.35 or $0.45 on Uber Eats deliveries &mdash; 100 percent of the surcharge goes straight to the Uber driver, the company says. </p><p>The added fees will not apply to deliveries and rides originating in New York City, Uber also said, after the city recently <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/nyc-gig-drivers-pay-increase-012304976.html\">increased the minimum pay</a> for drivers. The company also credits the high amount of bike deliveries there for its lack of surcharges. </p><div class=\"w-full mx-auto max-w-3xl font-sans mt-8 text-lg leading-loose md:text-xl md:leading-7\">\n        <span class=\"font-bold text-primary-400\">SEE ALSO:</span>\n        <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/best-electric-vehicles\" class=\"text-secondary-300\">\n            The best EVs for all different types of drivers\n                            <svg class=\"ml-1 w-4 h-4 fill-current inline-block font-normal\"><use href=\"/images/icons/spritemap.svg#sprite-arrow-right-thin\"></use></svg>\n                    </a>\n    </div>\n<ul><li><p><a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/uber-rider-ratings\"><b>Uber reveals rider ratings breakdown for first time</b></a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://mashable.com/video/joseph-gordon-levitt-colbert-travis-kalanick-heckler\"><b>Joseph Gordon-Levitt reacts to footage of Uber founder being heckled on 'Colbert'</b></a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/uber-safety-features-route-change\"><b>Uber's new safety update detects if your route changes</b></a></p></li></ul><p>Many Uber drivers have expressed frustration with the company's decisions to place the offset costs on riders, saying the per-ride fees are too low to account for the many miles a single Uber ride or delivery can traverse (and the accompanying amount of gas used). </p><p>Ben Valdez, an Uber driver and ride share organizer, told <i>The Washington Post</i> that new surcharges <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/03/11/uber-gas-prices/\">wouldn't be enough</a> to actually help many drivers faced with increasing financial burdens, and explained that it would take at least 10 trips for the fees to offset a gallon of gas.

alt=\"Person having their hair styled\"><p>If you somehow predicted that a company best known for its high-end <a href=\"https://mashable.com/roundup/best-dyson-vacuums-uk\">vacuums</a> and <a href=\"https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-air-purifiers-uk\">air purifiers</a> would also wind up making the world's most coveted hair tool, please come collect your prize.</p><p>We're talking, of course, about Dyson and its legendary Airwrap. Launched in 2018, the multi-functional styler has since earned a cult following for its ability to dry, smooth, and curl without the use of extreme heat. Eight different brush and barrel attachments make it suitable for a range of different hair types and textures &mdash;&nbsp;plus, it comes with a sleek leather case for easy storage.</p><p>No blazing-hot plates, no blistering metal rods, and no need to head to the hairdressers for a bouncy hairdo anymore? If that all sounds too good to be true, it kind of is: The Airwrap is even more expensive than a <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/playstation-5-review\">PlayStation 5</a> and just as hard to find.</p><h2><b>Why is the Dyson Airwrap so popular?</b></h2><p>We'd love to tell you that the Airwrap is an overhyped gimmick so you could save your hard-earned money, unsubscribe from all of those restock email alerts, and finally close out the Stock Informer tab that's been pinned to your browser window for months. In fact, that's probably going to be the case if you're someone who doesn't go out of the way to style their hair every single day: The Airwrap has a semi-steep learning curve, it takes up a lot of space, and at the end of the day, it just isn't some miracle-worker for unruly tresses that can't be tamed by other gadgets, said Mashable tech reporter Rachel Kraus.</p><p>But believe it or not, there is an actual time and place for a &pound;450 hair tool. The Airwrap is designed for use on damp hair, so if you like getting ready right after you hop out of the shower, it'll fit effortlessly into your existing routine. If you're worried about frying your ends with daily styling, the Airwrap \"could just be your follicles' saving grace,\" noted Kraus. And if you're someone who frequently drops hundreds of pounds on professional styling, an Airwrap could actually save you money in the long run.</p><p>For her part, Kraus couldn't justify the price of the Airwrap despite it working <a href=\"https://mashable.com/review/dyson-airwrap-styler\">\"really, really well\"</a> on her hair. If you find yourself in a similar boat, it's time to explore some alternatives.</p><h2><b>What should you consider when shopping for an Dyson Airwrap alternative?</b></h2><p>First, a little bit more about the Airwrap itself. According to a <a href=\"https://www.dyson.com/newsroom/overview/features/january-2021/love-is-in-the-air\">press release</a>, its motor harnesses the power of an aerodynamic phenomenon called the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1kQFJcKEaM\">Coanda effect</a>. This produces a spinning vortex of warm air, which attracts and automatically wraps hair around the Airwrap's barrel to gently dry while adding volume. All the while, an intelligent heat control system is measuring the device's temperature over 40 times a second to ensure it never ventures beyond 150&deg;C.</p><p>Dyson's engineers perfected this technology across about 500 prototypes, so as far as the Airwrap's design is concerned, it's safe to say there really is no exact match or fair comparison elsewhere on the market. That being said, you may be able to get similar results out of simpler tools (with a little practice) &mdash; namely, hot air brushes and certain <a href=\"https://mashable.com/roundup/best-curling-irons-uk\">curling irons</a> and straighteners.</p><p>Start your search by pinpointing the top reason why you're drawn to the Airwrap in the first place, aside from the \"minimal heat damage\" thing, and pinpoint the device out there that specialises in that department. Once you've figured out what kind of tool will get you closest to your desired results, you can further narrow your search using the following criteria:</p><p><b>Power </b>&mdash;<b> </b>A styling tool's air-blowing power is typically measured in watts. Those with higher wattage will usually produce more heat than those on the lower end, meaning they work faster but can damage hair quickly if you're not careful. Most hot air brushes fall somewhere in the 1,000- to 2,000-watt range. (For comparison's sake, the Airwrap's 1,300-watt motor puts it just slightly below the average pro-quality hair dryer and makes it capable of taking tresses from wet-ish to ready in about 10 to 15 minutes.)</p><p><b>Multiple heat settings</b> &mdash; Any styling tool that forces you to scorch your hair on \"high\" the whole time is a no from us. Being able to choose from a few different temperature settings makes it way easier to avoid heat damage, especially at the end of your hair routine when you're already mostly dry. (Bonus points for any tools with a cool shot, which will seal your hair's cuticles and set the look in place.) Keep in mind that Airwrap has three airflow speeds and four heat settings, including a constant cold shot.</p><p><b>Cord length </b>&mdash; Professional-quality styling tools can have cords as long as 8 or 9 feet &mdash;&nbsp;the Airwrap's clocks in at 8.2 feet &mdash; but you can get away with a shorter one if there's an outlet right next to your vanity.</p><p><b>Weight </b>&mdash;<b> </b>You're going to be holding this thing above your head for a not-insignificant amount of time, so the lighter, the better.</p><p>No matter what kind of device you wind up buying, even if it's an actual Airwrap, consider adding some styling products to your cart while you're at it, too. Dyson itself recommends using <a href=\"https://www.dyson.com/hair-care/hair-stylers/airwrap/how-to-use\">hairspray</a> to \"maximize curls' longevity\" and a <a href=\"https://www.dyson.com/knowledge/hair-care/how-does-heat-damage-hair\">heat protectant</a> \"whenever possible.\" (It can only help.) And for extra volume, its Global Lead Stylist Amy Johnson <a href=\"https://www.dyson.com/newsroom/overview/features/december-2021/christmas-styling-tips-us\">suggests</a> applying a mousse to your roots while your hair is still wet.</p><h2><b>What is the best Dyson Airwrap alternative?</b></h2><p>We've searched high and low for the best Dyson Airwrap alternatives, and lined up a strong selection of your best options.

Even though cats have been domesticated for centuries, they're still animals with instincts and curiosity. If you don't get your cats the proper toys and accessories, your cat could take out their confusion and anxiety on your favorite leather chair instead of a gadget or gizmo that's made for them.</p><p>With the <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/6wWMd\">Interactive Balance Feather Cat Toy</a>, you can keep your cat challenged, motivated, and even maybe even alleviate some of their anxiety at the same time. This toy is equipped with two weighted balance wheels that allows it to always return upright after it's hit by your cat. Your cat will have to stretch out and stand to hit the top of the ball or the feather, and will do it over and over again since the toy can not be knocked over. It's a great way to sneak in a little exercise for your cat while keeping them entertained by the prospect of catching the feather. Plus, it could be a helpful gadget for cats adjusting to a new home or for those getting used to you <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/cat-separation-anxiety-tips-resources\">returning back to work</a> for the first time in awhile.</p><p>If your cat usually shows no interest in toys, this one's different, thanks to the secret compartment that allows you to place catnip inside. It works best on hardwood floors, but can be used on flatter carpets as well.&nbsp;</p><p>The Interactive Balance Feather Cat Toy retails for $39, but you can shave 52% off of the regular retail price and bring it home for just <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/6wWMd\">$18.99</a> for a limited time.</p><p><i>Prices subject to change.</i></p><p></p><div class=\"max-w-3xl mx-auto mb-16 font-sans flex flex-col mt-8 md:flex-row\" data-ga-module=\"deal-card\" data-ga-element=\"offer\">\n    <div class=\"w-64 mx-auto md:mx-0 md:w-1/3\">\n                    <a class=\"block\" href=\"https://zdcs.link/6wWMd?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall&amp;short_url=6wWMd&amp;cd36=Standard&amp;t=deals&amp;m=deal-card&amp;e=offer&amp;i=image&amp;el=image\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" data-ga-action=\"product_image\" data-ga-label=\"image\" data-ga-item=\"image\" data-ga-click data-commerce-click>\n                <img class=\"w-full\" src=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/04nloW9ZdLZmq7QeHIOV6Nn/images-1.fit_lim.size_256x.jpg\" alt=\"Two cats playing with black ball with yellow ball on antenna\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"596\" height=\"447\">\n            </a>\n            <div class=\"mt-2 leading-none text-left\">\n                                    <span class=\"subtitle-2 text-gray-600 capitalize text-xs pr-5 mt-1\">Credit: Pet Essentials</span>\n                            </div>  \n            </div>\n    <div class=\"w-full pl-0 mt-3 md:w-2/3 md:mt-0 md:pl-8\">\n        <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/6wWMd?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall&amp;short_url=6wWMd&amp;cd36=Standard&amp;t=deals&amp;m=deal-card&amp;e=offer&amp;i=title&amp;el=offer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\" class=\"block text-xl font-bold text-secondary-300 mb-5 leading-8 text-center md:text-left hover:underline md:text-2xl\" data-ga-action=\"offer-title\" data-ga-item=\"title\" data-ga-label=\"$text\" data-ga-click data-commerce-click>Interactive Balance Feather Cat Toy</a>\n                    <div class=\"font-bold text-coolgray-900 font-sans text-base leading-6 text-center md:text-lg md:text-left\">$18.99 at the Mashable Shop</div>\n                <a class=\"font-bold text-center hover:underline leading-6\" href=\"https://zdcs.link/6wWMd?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall&amp;short_url=6wWMd&amp;cd36=Standard&amp;t=deals&amp;m=deal-card&amp;e=offer&amp;i=buy-button&amp;el=offer\" target=\"_blank\" data-ga-action=\"buy-link\" data-ga-item=\"buy-button\" data-ga-label=\"$text\" data-ga-click data-commerce-click> \n            <button class=\"mt-3 inline-block text-base font-bold font-sans btn btn-secondary w-full tracking-wide md:w-auto px-5 md:text-lg\">Get Deal</button>\n        </a>\n    </div>\n</div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Sun, 13 Mar 2022 09:00:00 +0000","feedId":91,"bgimg":"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/04nloW9ZdLZmq7QeHIOV6Nn/hero-image.jpg","linkMd5":"24546324b00469a6fb17601b9093584b","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn74@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-27-05-433_6a5351556e9e5076.webp","destWidth":3744,"destHeight":2106,"sourceBytes":2755721,"destBytes":2274570,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/04nloW9ZdLZmq7QeHIOV6Nn/hero-image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn74@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-27-05-433_6a5351556e9e5076.webp","https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/04nloW9ZdLZmq7QeHIOV6Nn/images-1.fit_lim.size_256x.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn15@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-27-25-226_d62e76e90a7ad126.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647246421744},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:27:01","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:27:01","title":"The best camping hammocks for your next outdoor excursion","link":"https://mashable.com/roundup/best-camping-hammocks","description":"<img src=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/roundups/07F1W5VJY4gJefxyOOTz4vF/hero-image.jpg\" alt=\"Two people sitting in a hammock near a lake\"><p>There's nothing quite like hanging out in a hammock at the campsite. Imagine sitting in the woods in a hammock, cold drink in hand, surrounded by a bunch of friends. Immaculate vibes.</p><p>While most camping folks opt for hammocks to lounge in during the day and then move to their tent when it's time to sleep, hammocks can actually be a space-efficient way to snooze in the outdoors &mdash; if you know what you're looking for. Most regular hammocks aren't comfortable enough to sleep in all night, and hammocks designed specifically for camping will have a lot of extra bells and whistles that will keep you cozy all night long. </p><p>Whether you're backpacking, car camping, or just hanging outside for a few hours, we have all the best recommendations. Skip to the bottom to read about the hammocks we've tested and researched, or read on to learn about all the features you should look for in a camping hammock before you buy.</p><h2><b>What to keep in mind when shopping for a camping hammock</b></h2><ul><li><p><b>What are you going to use your hammock for? </b>This is the main thing to address before you add a hammock to your online shopping cart. If you're planning on using a hammock to hang out at base camp, read a book, or maybe take a nap, you won't need to worry as much about an included rainfly, bug net, and other comfort-focused features. If you want to ditch your camping tent in favor of a hammock though, these features will become a lot more important. While some dedicated backpackers will opt to sleep in a hammock with no rain or bug coverage, most casual campers will appreciate the extra bug net and rainfly. </p></li><li><p><b>Weight:</b> Whether you&rsquo;re hiking or driving to your campsite, it&rsquo;s important to look for a hammock that won&rsquo;t weigh you down. If you&rsquo;re used to lugging a 20-pound air mattress on car camping trips, an average two-pound hammock shouldn&rsquo;t matter, but if you're backpacking, every ounce counts.</p></li><li><p><b>How small can it pack down:</b> Likewise, if you&rsquo;re planning on bringing your hammock on a hike, you&rsquo;ll want to look for one that can pack down pretty small. Most hammocks have the capacity to pack down into about the size of a football or smaller, and many have integrated stuff sacks.</p></li><li><p><b>Weight capacity:</b> Consider what kind of camping you plan on doing. If you&rsquo;re going with your kids or a significant other, you may want to look for a hammock that can support more weight so you can comfortably hang out in one hammock. </p></li><li><p><b>Suspension system:</b> If you want a fast, easy setup and takedown, hammocks with no-knot suspension systems are a must. These often have to be purchased separately from the actual hammock, but they have the ability to cut your setup time down to just a few minutes and can allow you to set your hammock up on trees that would normally be too far apart. These no-knot systems can also protect trees, whereas rope suspension systems may damage bark on trees. Using rope as suspension is cheaper (and sometimes rope is included with hammocks) but you need to know how to tie knots really well if you want to string your hammock up that way.</p></li><li><p><b>Comfort: </b>While comfort is subjective, we recommend always investing in a high quality hammock that includes suspension straps and carabiners to keep you secure. If you're planning on sleeping in your hammock overnight, a structural ridge line and the ability to lie flat are important, too.</p></li><li><p><b>Bug net: </b>If you&rsquo;re particularly sensitive to insect bites or you know you&rsquo;ll be frequently camping in an area dense with mosquitos, you may want to consider looking into a built-in bug net. External netting is also available but can be more of a hassle to set up.</p></li><li><p><b>Rainfly:</b> When forgoing the tent in favor of a hammock, it's best to be safe and keep a rainfly handy. A rainfly isn't just good for when it's raining &mdash; it''ll also keep condensation, bugs, and foliage off of you while you sleep. Even if you don't end up using it, you'll be glad you have it.</p></li></ul><p>With that in mind, we&rsquo;ve pulled together some of the absolute best camping hammocks you can buy. Whether you&rsquo;re looking for something that&rsquo;ll take you through all four seasons, or you really just want something that&rsquo;s quick and easy to assemble and take down, these are the hammocks you&rsquo;ll actually want to hang out in.</p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 11 Mar 2022 18:17:55 +0000","feedId":91,"bgimg":"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/roundups/07F1W5VJY4gJefxyOOTz4vF/hero-image.jpg","linkMd5":"ec717f5bcd66498f0d0be466965ccec3","destWidth":1500,"destHeight":1500,"sourceBytes":462137,"destBytes":492950,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/roundups/07F1W5VJY4gJefxyOOTz4vF/hero-image.jpg":null},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647246421757},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:27:01","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:27:01","title":"Learn to code from home with this online bootcamp on sale for under $30","link":"https://mashable.com/deals/march-12-coding-bootcamp","description":"<img src=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/02OBtHor04NeSYguhdREcRj/hero-image.jpg\" alt=\"Child at computer showing coding screen\"><p><b>TL;DR: </b>As of March 12, <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/jBjrv\">The Coding 101 Bootcamp Beginners Bundle</a> &mdash;&nbsp;worth $2,000 &mdash; is just $29, which means you can get it for 98% off.</p><hr><p>The perfect time to learn to code may never arise, but the need for coders will always be there.

It's arrogant, dismissive, and a bit of a copout that saves the film having to explain its in-universe physics.

Between now and 2050, time travel is invented, implemented, and abused. Adult Adam (Reynolds) travels back from the future to stop time travel ever being discovered and to save his wife Laura (Zoe Saldana) &mdash; with the help of his 12-year-old self (Scobell).</p><p>Scobell is a sheer delight in his feature debut, if anything impeded by the demand to recreate Reynolds' signature snark with that incongruously sweet countenance. His Reynolds impression is also excellent, so this is not a critique so much as regret that we'll have to wait for yet another role to showcase Scobell independently. Surrounded by adult A-listers, he exudes the presence and conviction of a seasoned star (again, maybe imitating Reynolds &mdash; and again, not a bad thing).</p><div class=\"w-full mx-auto max-w-3xl font-sans mt-8 text-lg leading-loose md:text-xl md:leading-7\">\n        <span class=\"font-bold text-primary-400\">SEE ALSO:</span>\n        <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/the-batman-review\" class=\"text-secondary-300\">\n            'The Batman' Review: A crime-thriller suffocated by PG-13 demands\n                            <svg class=\"ml-1 w-4 h-4 fill-current inline-block font-normal\"><use href=\"/images/icons/spritemap.svg#sprite-arrow-right-thin\"></use></svg>\n                    </a>\n    </div>\n<p>Reynolds brings the aforementioned snark, albeit nowhere near <i>Deadpool</i> levels and tempered with moving moments Adam shares with his mother (Jennifer Garner), father (Mark Ruffalo), and younger self. He and Saldana make the most of their limited shared screen time, selling a time-torn romance that at least one of them thinks is worth dooming the rest of humanity. Catherine Keener is mesmerizing but underutilized as the villainous Sorian, hunting Adam and Laura with the dangerous composure of someone who knows they never lose.</p><p>With Levy's sensibilities at the helm, <i>The Adam Project</i>'s visuals are vibrant and dynamic, even with the specter of dystopia in our future. The aircraft and weaponry are sleek but not distracting. People do not bruise or bleed in this universe &mdash; except Reynolds in an early scene meant to underscore his physical attractiveness &mdash; but instead burst into chaotic prisms of light and color when they die outside of their own timeline. The low point is a needlessly de-aged Keener, intended to look 30 years younger but also deeply uncanny. Sometimes we can just cast younger actors or ignore the laws of aging.</p><div class=\"eloquent-imagery-image\">\n    <div class=\"flex justify-center\">\n        <img class=\"border border-gray-100 h-full\" src=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/03AV8JRgl2WZS4g31vFbwKq/images-2.fit_lim.size_2000x.v1646951145.jpg\" alt='Close up of actors Zoe Saldana and Ryan Reynolds with their foreheads together in a still from \"The Adam Project.\"' srcset=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/03AV8JRgl2WZS4g31vFbwKq/images-2.fit_lim.size_800x.v1646951145.jpg 800w,https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/03AV8JRgl2WZS4g31vFbwKq/images-2.fit_lim.size_1400x.v1646951145.jpg 1400w,https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/03AV8JRgl2WZS4g31vFbwKq/images-2.fit_lim.size_2000x.v1646951145.jpg 1600w\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1408px) 100vw, 1408px\" width=\"2000\" height=\"954\">\n\n\n    </div>\n            <div class=\"mt-4 subtitle-2 font-sans text-left\">\n            <span class=\"text-gray-1000 normal-case\">Rooting for them so hard.</span>\n            <span class=\"credit text-gray-600 capitalize\">Credit: Netflix</span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p><i>The Adam Project</i> succeeds by not bogging down a strong emotional core with too much sci-fi minutiae. We don't know why time travel was invented or what its purpose was before it got corrupted, nor do we know what went so wrong that adult Adam says of <i>The Terminator</i>: \"That's 2050 on a good day.\"</p><p>And crucially, we don't care. This is the story of a boy and his parents, a man and his wife, in which people sometimes zip through time and burst into colorful bubbles. Garner's scenes showcase the maternal warmth here she executed so well in <i>Juno</i>, here worn on her sleeve with remarkable vulnerability. She and Ruffalo tap into their winsome <i>13 Going on 30</i> chemistry like no time has passed, and his role as father to the two Adams wonderfully anchors the film's final act and emotional climax. These relationships give <i>The Adam Project</i> a strong foundation even if its genre elements have more flourish than depth, the way <i>Stranger Things</i> first struck such a chord with audiences by focusing on a separated mother and son.</p><p>Levy's love of '80s sci-fi is apparent. With this latest, he's on track to create a nostalgic sub-genre that will inform its own generation of film nerds &mdash; as long as we don't invent time travel. </p><p><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/search?q=the%20adam%20project&amp;jbv=81309354\"><i>The Adam Project</i></a><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/search?q=the%20adam%20project&amp;jbv=81309354\"> is now streaming on Netflix</a>.</p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 11 Mar 2022 12:00:00 +0000","feedId":91,"bgimg":"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/03AV8JRgl2WZS4g31vFbwKq/hero-image.jpg","linkMd5":"3cc784bde36490f37ecd75d9d6829f56","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn75@2020_3/2022/03/14/08-27-02-731_8a1db32c26d94d47.webp","destWidth":1921,"destHeight":1080,"sourceBytes":984865,"destBytes":458724,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/03AV8JRgl2WZS4g31vFbwKq/hero-image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn75@2020_3/2022/03/14/08-27-02-731_8a1db32c26d94d47.webp","https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/03AV8JRgl2WZS4g31vFbwKq/images-1.fit_lim.size_2000x.v1646951145.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn97@2020_1/2022/03/14/08-27-26-022_b8f090f82cb940c7.webp","https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/03AV8JRgl2WZS4g31vFbwKq/images-2.fit_lim.size_2000x.v1646951145.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn65@2020_5/2022/03/14/08-27-25-459_0fc2ab4b2ad06b8b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647246421763},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:27:01","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:27:01","title":"14 of the best 'Wordle' clones, because one word a day isn't enough","link":"https://mashable.com/article/best-wordle-clones-alternatives","description":"<img src=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/06rQ2AGLr5cl4wm6lFNwidE/hero-image.jpg\" alt=\"Image of phones with Wordle screen open\"><p>If you've spent any time on the internet lately, you know that <i>Wordle</i> has taken over. </p><p>Our obsession has been endlessly <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/wordle-word-game-what-is-it-explained\">analyzed</a> and dissected.

In trolling Russian president Vladimir Putin (\"I don't bite,\" Zelensky said when suggesting negotiations, referencing Putin's habit of sitting at the other end of long tables), as in mobilizing world opinion behind Ukraine, his prior experience as an actor and comedian has served him well.</p><p>Which is why this is a perfect time for western audiences to familiarize themselves with Zelensky's <i>Servant of the People</i> &mdash; one of the most intriguing and historically important shows you could possibly watch right now. And you <i>should</i> watch, as much and as fast as you can &mdash; despite a bizarre number of obstacles in accessing the whole thing.  </p><p>This is the TV show that ran in Ukraine for three seasons (plus a movie) from 2015 to 2018. Zelensky's character is a history teacher who is unexpectedly elected president in a landslide after his students post a viral video of him complaining about corruption and crowdfund his campaign online. Life imitated art when Zelensky started a Servant of the People Party, ran for president in a campaign run almost entirely on social media, and won in a landslide.</p><p>It may not explain why Russia started this war as well as, say, <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/death-of-stalin-trump-era\"><i>The Death of Stalin</i></a><a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/death-of-stalin-trump-era\"> </a>(in which we see a megalomaniacal Russian leader and his cowed underlings who can't even trust each other, let alone deliver bad news). Still, for outsiders, <i>Servant of the People</i> is something of a lesson in Ukrainian politics and culture, and yet the 24-minute episodes are easy to binge. The humor, a handful of references aside, is universal. </p><p>This is satire of the fast-moving, widely-accessible kind. The show consistently tells the terrible truth about real-life villains &mdash; the billionaire oligarchs who stop any government working for the people &mdash; in a way only the court jester of a hopeful democracy can. </p><div class=\"w-full mx-auto max-w-3xl font-sans mt-8 text-lg leading-loose md:text-xl md:leading-7\">\n        <span class=\"font-bold text-primary-400\">SEE ALSO:</span>\n        <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/ukraine-viral-heroes\" class=\"text-secondary-300\">\n            Ukraine's everyday heroes are owning social media\n                            <svg class=\"ml-1 w-4 h-4 fill-current inline-block font-normal\"><use href=\"/images/icons/spritemap.svg#sprite-arrow-right-thin\"></use></svg>\n                    </a>\n    </div>\n<p>Zelensky emerges from the show less a buffoon, more a heartfelt true believer in democracy. The nearest American analogue might be Jimmy Stewart in the classic Frank Capra movie <i>Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, </i>another great advertisement for democratic principles in dark times. In both stories a somewhat naive history-lover is elevated to high office, refuses to bow to corruption, suffers outrageous smears from the corrupt, and holds the line of morality with from-the-hip speeches. </p><div class=\"giphy-embed\">\n    <video class=\"w-full\" autoplay loop muted playsinline>\n        <source src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/BZzD3msZH8xE164gZj/giphy.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n        <img src=\"https://media4.giphy.com/media/BZzD3msZH8xE164gZj/giphy.gif\" title=\"Your browser does not support the mp4 video codec.\">\n    </source></video>\n    <small>Via <a href=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/BZzD3msZH8xE164gZj/giphy.gif\" target=\"_blank\">Giphy</a></small>\n</div>\n<p><i>Servant of the People</i> gives <i>Mr. Smith</i> a humor upgrade by way of <i>Veep</i>, with a little Walter Mitty-style daydreaming (Zelensky's character, Vasily Petrovich Goloborodko, often finds himself talking to historical figures in his head). I also saw scenes and setups that reminded me of <i>The Office, Parks and Rec, The Great, The Thick of It, Yes Prime Minister, Arrested Development, </i>and if you're chomping at the bit to watch it all after that name-checking, you're my kind of people. </p><h2><b>How to watch: with difficulty</b></h2><p>But therein lies the trouble: Watching it all. After tracking down the world's most wondered-about show, the best I can suggest is that you time-travel back a couple of years and convince yourself to watch it on Netflix in its entirety before it vanishes from the streaming service for still-unexplained reasons. Search for it on Netflix now and you'll get redirected to <i>Winter on Fire</i>, the documentary on the 2014 protests that forced Ukraine's pro-Putin, police-state-loving president Viktor Yanukovych to flee the country (which is well worth your time, but not exactly the same thing.) </p><p>If you're in the UK, <i>Servant of the People</i> is now screening on Channel 4 &mdash; but at a painfully slow rate. Currently, just three episodes out of the 24 in season 1 are <a href=\"https://www.channel4.com/programmes/servant-of-the-people\">available on the UK-only All 4 streaming app</a>. (Which is also pretty much what's available on torrenting services; not that you'd ever check such things, of course.) The company that owns TV rights has been doing brisk sales, <a href=\"https://qz.com/2137125/which-channels-are-airing-zelenskyys-servant-of-the-people/\">according to multiple reports</a>, but will not reveal if there's a U.S. taker yet. Given the amount of disinformation about Zelensky rife in certain dark corners of American politics &mdash; Rep. Madison Cawthorn was just caught on video calling Ukraine's leader a \"<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/10/politics/madison-cawthorn-volodymyr-zelensky-comments/index.html\">thug</a>\" &mdash; the show that proves the Putin apologists wrong can't come to U.S. screens soon enough. </p><p>For now, would-be <i>Servant of the People</i> viewers are left with YouTube, where there is good and bad news. Good news: Zelensky's own production company has uploaded every episode, so we're talking high-quality transfers, not bad user rips. Bad news for English speakers: Most of the episodes offer only Russian subtitles. (Conversely, this is good news for anti-Putin forces in Russia, where the show was already popular, YouTube still isn't banned, and Zelensky's heroism needs to be kept top of mind.) Some of the episodes with English subtitles are more comprehensible than others. If YouTube wanted to do some good in the world, and thank Zelensky for the millions of ad impressions he's brought to the online video giant, it could sink some money into a full-on worldwide <i>Servant of the People</i> translation project. </p><p>In the meantime, here's a quick guide to the best <i>Servant of the People</i> viewing experience currently possible.</p><h2>Episodes 1 and 2</h2><div class=\"w-full max-w-4xl mx-auto mt-8\">\n    <div id=\"video-container-GZ-3YwVQV0M\"></div>\n</div>\n\n\n<p>The double-length premiere is a great place to start. <i>Servant of the People</i> wisely skips over the whole election part, dropping us into the story the morning that history teacher Vasily Petrovich Goloborodko (who lives with his family) learns his campaign for the president was successful. He's then ushered through a dizzying round of interviews and makeovers by the prime minister, Yuri Ivanovich Chuiko, whose silky smoothness you would be right to distrust. The story of the viral video and the crowdfunding that kickstarted his campaign is told in flashback. And the shadowy oligarchs we'll come to know later in the show are anonymous, their faces always covered by items of furniture as they plot nefarious schemes. </p><p>And here, in all its glory, is the joke that was cut when the show aired in Russia. Vasily is offered a range of expensive watches, and is told which one Putin favors. \"Putin Hublot?\" he says innocently &mdash; a phrase that sounds a lot like \"Putin khuilo,\" a Ukrainian football chant that translates roughly to \"Putin is a dickhead.\"  </p><h2>Episode 3</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQSlZJVFKzg&amp;list=PLSoP62RB3ymmSC-1UmiVAOcMlTijhohVu&amp;index=2\">Episode 3</a> focuses on Vasily's family; in an early sign of the corruption that will surround him everywhere he goes, his mother, father, niece and sister are seen promising government positions to their friends and receiving \"100 percent discounts\" at their favorite stores. (A shopping trip is in order after the family fears it won't be able to dress as elegantly as Michelle Obama, who is said to be attending the inauguration.) The fourth wall shatters when a couple of policemen ask the family if they can \"do something about\" comedians who criticize the government. </p><h2>Episode 4</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-myY55Gjmw&amp;list=PLSoP62RB3ymmSC-1UmiVAOcMlTijhohVu&amp;index=3\">Episode 4</a> opens with what is hands-down my favorite scene of the show: Vasily being shown around his swanky new presidential residence. He finds a chandelier so expensive that it caused the country to default on its debt during the 2008 financial crisis, and a parrot that squawks \"no, you're the idiot!\" when it hears the name of ousted pro-Putin president Viktor Yanukovych; the show was actually filmed on the massive estate Yanukovych had vacated in a hurry less than two years earlier. Unfortunately the episode is the first to lose its English subtitles before the end, so if you want to see Zelensky's character chatting about his inauguration address with Abraham Lincoln, you'll need to watch <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AdMISdvbcc\">this version</a>. </p><h2>Episode 5</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yz3hsUi5qV4&amp;list=PLSoP62RB3ymmSC-1UmiVAOcMlTijhohVu&amp;index=4\">Episode 5</a> may be my favorite episode overall &mdash; and certainly the show's best example of physical comedy. In the first half, Vasily spends much of his time running away from his ridiculously large security detail. In the second, we're introduced to his presidential predecessor, who has barricaded himself into his office with a shotgun and a bar full of booze. Much of the show hits differently now Russia has invaded Ukraine, but this is the first scene that hits differently in the wake of Donald Trump's disastrous bid to cling on to power. </p><p>The quality of the English translation starts to go downhill with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PAZr1bQlkI&amp;list=PLSoP62RB3ymmSC-1UmiVAOcMlTijhohVu&amp;index=5\">episode 6</a>, in which Vasily falls out with his family, yells \"Putin has been overthrown\" to get the attention of squabbling deputies, and has a chat with Che Guevara. Subtitles then disappear early in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6gsVaBPxw&amp;list=PLSoP62RB3ymmSC-1UmiVAOcMlTijhohVu&amp;index=6\">episode 7</a>. In <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgMVWTcRw2E&amp;list=PLSoP62RB3ymmSC-1UmiVAOcMlTijhohVu&amp;index=7\">episode 8</a>, the show takes a turn towards screwball office comedy, as Vasily brings in a cabinet of outsiders like himself &mdash; only they all happen to be his old school pals. The show presents them as a cadre of trusted allies who are less likely to take bribes, but it's hard for a viewer not to notice that such nepotism is a form of corruption in itself. In <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0-vvSxsdsQ&amp;list=PLSoP62RB3ymmSC-1UmiVAOcMlTijhohVu&amp;index=8\">episodes 9</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayL8XFqm2SM&amp;list=PLSoP62RB3ymmSC-1UmiVAOcMlTijhohVu&amp;index=9\">10</a>, the oligarchs take a number of steps to bribe or bring down the new cabinet, including dosing one member with psychedelics. </p><p>As promising a plotline as that may be, we're lost without English subtitles for the next 13 episodes. (You can try auto-translating the Russian captions, but good luck with that.) Which brings us to the last and most epic English language experience in the current canon:</p><h2><i>Servant of the People 2: </i>The Movie</h2><div class=\"w-full max-w-4xl mx-auto mt-8\">\n    <div id=\"video-container-T9kL5XSMBxo\"></div>\n</div>\n\n\n<p>After Season 1 was a huge hit, Zelensky and company repackaged a planned plotline from Season 2 as a (mercifully well-subtitled) 90-minute movie, <i>Servant of the People 2</i>. Here you'll encounter mild spoilers; Yuri Ivanovich, the prime minister, is in jail, having been unmasked as a stooge of the oligarchs, and Vasily is dating an assistant who is also revealed to be one of their people. </p><p>To break up an alliance of the three most powerful oligarchs, Vasily and Yuri take a train to the east of the country (including, chillingly, several cities that are currently under heavy Russian bombardment). Classic road movie farce ensues. Meanwhile Ukraine has applied for a loan from the International Monetary Fund, which keeps piling on the onerous conditions even as Vasily's hapless foreign minister tries to keep the IMF leadership drunk.  </p><p>Vasily's speech at the end of the movie responding to the IMF loan offer is a thing of beauty, and in retrospect can be applied to any situation where Ukraine has been pushed too far. \"We're not a border region between orcs and elves,\" Vasily says. \"We are a nation of open, clever and talented people. When we understand this, when we understand that stealing is bad, that we need to roll up our sleeves and work hard ... Then the whole world will say 'glory to Ukraine!'\" <i>Slava Ukraini</i> indeed. </p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 11 Mar 2022 20:00:08 +0000","feedId":91,"bgimg":"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/05HoBiY7qLj1eoDk7zGNHvc/hero-image.jpg","linkMd5":"254b338bdd9ecebb7b21f07fc4805004","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn20@2020_5/2022/03/14/08-27-02-038_257a6fe24fda2734.webp","destWidth":1920,"destHeight":1033,"sourceBytes":198047,"destBytes":99234,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/05HoBiY7qLj1eoDk7zGNHvc/hero-image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn20@2020_5/2022/03/14/08-27-02-038_257a6fe24fda2734.webp","https://media4.giphy.com/media/BZzD3msZH8xE164gZj/giphy.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn35@2020_3/2022/03/14/08-27-26-393_743e77e33a0ccbce.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647246421756},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:27:01","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:27:01","title":"Air fryer breakfast cookies are super easy to make and pretty healthy","link":"https://mashable.com/article/air-fryer-breakfast-cookies-healthy","description":"<img src=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/04eNYUX8nb1fr210XA0j3qR/hero-image.png\" alt=\"cookie with airfryday logo\"><div class=\"raw-embed\">\n    <div style=\"position: relative; width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%\"><iframe style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0;\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" src=\"https://embedder.wirewax.com/8261313\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"yes\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n</div>\n<hr><p>I'll be upfront: I am not a sweet breakfast person.

If I didn't slow down for filming and photos, I think I could have made this breakfast in like 13 minutes, just a few of which would have involved actually <i>doing </i>anything. Just mash a bunch of stuff together, shape it into a puck, and air fry. Simple. </p><p>The only real tip I have about the beginning of the cooking process is concerning the mashed banana. In the TikTok from Addison, she mashes the banana in the big bowl with everything else. I did this step separately and I think it helped ensure the banana spread throughout the cookie instead of clumping to oats while being mashed. Here's how all my ingredients looked in the bowl.</p><div class=\"eloquent-imagery-image\">\n    <div class=\"flex justify-center\">\n        <img class=\"border border-gray-100 h-full\" src=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/04eNYUX8nb1fr210XA0j3qR/images-1.fit_lim.size_2000x.v1646951549.jpg\" alt=\"mashed ingredients in bowl\" srcset=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/04eNYUX8nb1fr210XA0j3qR/images-1.fit_lim.size_800x.v1646951549.jpg 800w,https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/04eNYUX8nb1fr210XA0j3qR/images-1.fit_lim.size_1400x.v1646951549.jpg 1400w,https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/04eNYUX8nb1fr210XA0j3qR/images-1.fit_lim.size_2000x.v1646951549.jpg 1600w\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1408px) 100vw, 1408px\" width=\"2000\" height=\"2000\">\n\n\n    </div>\n            <div class=\"mt-4 subtitle-2 font-sans text-left\">\n            <span class=\"text-gray-1000 normal-case\">Mmmmmm oat mash. </span>\n            <span class=\"credit text-gray-600 capitalize\">Credit: Mashable</span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>From there, I cut some parchment to size, then placed it in my air fryer.

My cookie turned out fine with those instructions, but the exterior was definitely a bit more charred than I would've liked. Keep an eye on your cookie because I suspect, with some air fryer models, you might want to cook for about eight minutes instead of 10. Here was my final product. </p><div class=\"eloquent-imagery-image\">\n    <div class=\"flex justify-center\">\n        <img class=\"border border-gray-100 h-full\" src=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/04eNYUX8nb1fr210XA0j3qR/images-3.fit_lim.size_2000x.v1646951549.jpg\" alt=\"cookie on plate\" srcset=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/04eNYUX8nb1fr210XA0j3qR/images-3.fit_lim.size_800x.v1646951549.jpg 800w,https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/04eNYUX8nb1fr210XA0j3qR/images-3.fit_lim.size_1400x.v1646951549.jpg 1400w,https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/04eNYUX8nb1fr210XA0j3qR/images-3.fit_lim.size_2000x.v1646951549.jpg 1600w\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1408px) 100vw, 1408px\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\">\n\n\n    </div>\n            <div class=\"mt-4 subtitle-2 font-sans text-left\">\n            <span class=\"text-gray-1000 normal-case\">Little burnt?

Not mind-blowing, but a good, quick breakfast. It tasted like baked oats in a cookie shape. And you know why? Because it was basically baked oats in a cookie shape.</p><p>But that's not a bad thing. The interior of the cookie was soft, fluffy, and tasty. There was enough sweetness from the banana and protein powder that there was no need for any added sugars. I split the cookie with (<i>Borat voice</i>) my wife and it was a nice midday snack. </p><p>I remain an egg-based breakfast person. You cannot change from savory to sweet overnight. There is nothing like a fried egg on a corn tortilla. Never gets old. But should I get the urge to mix things up, I could absolutely see this cookie in my future. </p><h2><b>More on Foodtok</b></h2><p><a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/best-tiktok-food-trends-of-2021\">The 7 TikTok recipes of 2021 that actually deserved the hype</a></p><p><a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/easy-air-fryer-breakfast-tacos-recipe\">$1 air fryer breakfast tacos are easy to make and so delicious</a></p><p><a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/air-fryer-oranges-viral-tiktok-recipe-review\">A recipe for air-fried oranges went viral.

The Pittsburgh-born artist, who rose to fame with his silkscreen paintings <i>Campbell's Soup Cans</i>, was so influential that his unique and multifaceted brand has gone on to influence countless painters, filmmakers, musicians, and social media stars. 35 years after his death, his fingerprints can be found smudged across our contemporary landscape. Yet the person behind his larger-than-life persona is a slippery mystery &mdash; one that Netflix's new documentary mini-series <i>The Andy Warhol Diaries</i> might set out to solve.&nbsp;</p><p>The title is literal, named after the posthumously published journals <i>The Andy Warhol Diaries</i>, which were edited by Warhol's longtime friend and collaborator, Pat Hackett. Across six episodes, director Andrew Rossi deep-dives into the diaries' stories with interviews from Hackett and a parade of colleagues, art experts, historians, and celebrity friends, including Debbie Harry, Rob Lowe, and John Waters. As Warhol was also a filmmaker and photographer, Rossi is spoiled for choice in terms of archival footage. His selections range from interviews with the artist to his films, news footage, and a flood of photographs, public and personal.&nbsp;</p><div class=\"eloquent-imagery-image\">\n    <div class=\"flex justify-center\">\n        <img class=\"border border-gray-100 h-full\" src=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/03vAnX0NkdSJMD8Gak8JFWG/images-4.fit_lim.size_2000x.v1646865506.jpg\" alt=\"Andy Warhol with his eyes closed next to a friend in heavy makeup and a straw hat.\" srcset=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/03vAnX0NkdSJMD8Gak8JFWG/images-4.fit_lim.size_800x.v1646865506.jpg 800w,https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/03vAnX0NkdSJMD8Gak8JFWG/images-4.fit_lim.size_1400x.v1646865506.jpg 1400w,https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/03vAnX0NkdSJMD8Gak8JFWG/images-4.fit_lim.size_2000x.v1646865506.jpg 1600w\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1408px) 100vw, 1408px\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\">\n\n\n    </div>\n            <div class=\"mt-4 subtitle-2 font-sans text-left\">\n            <span class=\"text-gray-1000 normal-case\"></span>\n            <span class=\"credit text-gray-600 capitalize\">Credit: Netflix</span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<h2>The controversial use of artificial intelligence in documentary narration</h2><p>Last summer, <a href=\"https://slate.com/culture/2021/07/anthony-bourdain-roadrunner-documentary-movie-ai-morgan-neville.html\">outrage arose over Anthony Bourdain-centered documentary </a><a href=\"https://slate.com/culture/2021/07/anthony-bourdain-roadrunner-documentary-movie-ai-morgan-neville.html\"><i>Roadrunner</i></a> because that documentarian employed AI to create narration in the late Bourdain's voice. Critics, fans, and Bourdain's family were shocked when this device was revealed after the film's release. A similar tool is used in <i>The Warhol Diaries</i>. However, it's never hidden. <a href=\"https://mashable.com/video/andy-warhol-netflix\">It was announced in the trailer,</a> it's made clear in the documentary, and its use has been approved by The Andy Warhol Foundation. So, Rossi has thoughtfully addressed all the issues raised by <i>Roadrunner</i>. But how does it play?&nbsp;</p><p>When the AI is announced via a title card, a quote by Warhol follows: &ldquo;Machines have less problems. I&rsquo;d like to be a machine, wouldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Throughout the film, this concept &mdash; this wish to be a machine &mdash;&nbsp; is echoed, as the man struggles with his body's weaknesses, desires, and crippling insecurity around his work and his looks. Warhol's actual voice has a signature flatness and aloofness. So the AI translation seems all the more fitting. However, there are times when a word comes out jarringly robot-y, reminding the viewer that the diary entries are being read by a machine. But since Warhol once <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he1XK7aQOrU\">participated in having a robot version of himself built</a>, this feels fitting too.&nbsp;</p><div class=\"eloquent-imagery-image\">\n    <div class=\"flex justify-center\">\n        <img class=\"border border-gray-100 h-full\" src=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/03vAnX0NkdSJMD8Gak8JFWG/images-1.fit_lim.size_2000x.v1646857812.jpg\" alt=\"A black and white photo of two men in suits; one is Andy Warhol. \" srcset=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/03vAnX0NkdSJMD8Gak8JFWG/images-1.fit_lim.size_800x.v1646857812.jpg 800w,https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/03vAnX0NkdSJMD8Gak8JFWG/images-1.fit_lim.size_1400x.v1646857812.jpg 1400w,https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/03vAnX0NkdSJMD8Gak8JFWG/images-1.fit_lim.size_2000x.v1646857812.jpg 1600w\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1408px) 100vw, 1408px\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\">\n\n\n    </div>\n            <div class=\"mt-4 subtitle-2 font-sans text-left\">\n            <span class=\"text-gray-1000 normal-case\">Jon Gould and Andy Warhol. </span>\n            <span class=\"credit text-gray-600 capitalize\">Credit: Netflix</span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<h2>Not for Warhol newbies</h2><p>If you're planning to sit down for a six-hour documentary on an artist, Rossi assumes you know the basics. The first episode will offer a manic montage that swiftly spells out the impact Warhol has had on modern pop culture. But the iconic soup cans, The Factory and its stars, and <a href=\"https://www.history.com/news/andy-warhol-shot-valerie-solanas-the-factory\">the assassination attempt</a> are regarded more as timeline markers than chapters unto themselves. Rather than focusing on these elements that have been much discussed already, <i>The Warhol Diaries</i> looks to understand who he was beyond the headlines and the screenprint coolness. So, Rossi takes us back to the Byzantine Catholic church and the rough blue-collar neighborhood where a young and <a href=\"https://www.villagevoice.com/2000/05/09/swish-myth/\">undeniably \"swish\"</a> Warhol faced inspiration and persecution.&nbsp;</p><p>From there, Rossi charts his journey to New York City. Then the episodes become focused on pivotal personal relationships &mdash; some romantic, some platonic, some much harder to pin down. The second episode, \"Shadows: Andy &amp; Jed\", focuses on Warhol and his long-term boyfriend, Jed Johnson, who became an illustrious interior designer to the stars. \"A Double Life: Andy &amp; Jon\" dives into the relationship between the artist and his closeted paramour, Paramount Pictures executive Jon Gould. \"Collab: Andy &amp; Basquiat\" explores the friendship between Warhol and Jean-Michel Basquiat, which was devoted but plagued by the pressures of the art world and personal blind spots.&nbsp;</p><div class=\"eloquent-imagery-image\">\n    <div class=\"flex justify-center\">\n        <img class=\"border border-gray-100 h-full\" src=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/03vAnX0NkdSJMD8Gak8JFWG/images-3.fit_lim.size_2000x.v1646865506.jpg\" alt=\"Andy Warhol and an associate, both carrying cameras.\" srcset=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/03vAnX0NkdSJMD8Gak8JFWG/images-3.fit_lim.size_800x.v1646865506.jpg 800w,https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/03vAnX0NkdSJMD8Gak8JFWG/images-3.fit_lim.size_1400x.v1646865506.jpg 1400w,https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/03vAnX0NkdSJMD8Gak8JFWG/images-3.fit_lim.size_2000x.v1646865506.jpg 1600w\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1408px) 100vw, 1408px\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\">\n\n\n    </div>\n            <div class=\"mt-4 subtitle-2 font-sans text-left\">\n            <span class=\"text-gray-1000 normal-case\"></span>\n            <span class=\"credit text-gray-600 capitalize\">Credit: Netflix</span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<h2>What it means to make a diary a documentary</h2><p>Diaries are not reliable narrators. Often, they are written in a fit of feeling for an audience of one. Still, Warhol was aware that his fame meant his decade-long diary-keeping could be preserved. So, on top of omissions, there are codes in the diaries, allusions to people and events he cannot bring himself to name. Other times, Warhol shares a thought that's insensitive or even outright bigoted. Rossi and his interview subjects bring to light these shadowy parts and do so with understanding but not excuses.&nbsp;</p><p>Those closest to Warhol flesh out the highs and lows of his life and loves, giving context to terse anecdotes and urgent scrawls. Old friends challenge some events as Warhol recounts them, noting he had a flair for the romantic when writing about a particular beau. However, other debates over the contents of the diaries are more problematic, spoiling an ideal image of Warhol. More on that in a bit. </p><div class=\"eloquent-imagery-image\">\n    <div class=\"flex justify-center\">\n        <img class=\"border border-gray-100 h-full\" src=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/03vAnX0NkdSJMD8Gak8JFWG/images-2.fit_lim.size_2000x.v1646857812.jpg\" alt=\"Keith Haring, Andy Warhol, and Jean-Michel Basquiat pose for a group photo.\" srcset=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/03vAnX0NkdSJMD8Gak8JFWG/images-2.fit_lim.size_800x.v1646857812.jpg 800w,https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/03vAnX0NkdSJMD8Gak8JFWG/images-2.fit_lim.size_1400x.v1646857812.jpg 1400w,https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/03vAnX0NkdSJMD8Gak8JFWG/images-2.fit_lim.size_2000x.v1646857812.jpg 1600w\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1408px) 100vw, 1408px\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\">\n\n\n    </div>\n            <div class=\"mt-4 subtitle-2 font-sans text-left\">\n            <span class=\"text-gray-1000 normal-case\">Keith Haring, Andy Warhol, and Jean-Michel Basquiat pose for a group photo.</span>\n            <span class=\"credit text-gray-600 capitalize\">Credit: Netflix</span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<h2>Andy Warhol: complicated queer icon</h2><p>Today, Warhol is embraced a legend of queer America, who captured queer desire and made queer art nationally recognized. However, Warhol struggled with his queer identity throughout his life, in part because of a Catholic upbringing that urged shame on homosexuals. His art, journals, and friends delve into this inner turmoil, which expressed itself in a desire to hide \"the real me.\" The Warhol persona wasn't just a living art installation, but also a shield that protected Warhol from some of the most vicious homophobia raging in America through the '60s, '70s, and '80s. This film, and its talking heads, dig unflinchingly into what that meant and how it looked. It's not all pretty. </p><p><i>The Warhol Diaries</i> also explores the ways in which Warhol fell short as a queer leader. His <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/andy-warhol-2121/ladies-and-gentlemen\"><i>Ladies and Gentlemen</i></a> portrait series could be viewed as a celebration of transgender people or exploitation of them. His relationship with Basquiat was one of admiration but also charged with racial tension, as Warhol was an older white man who didn't comprehend the challenges a young Black man faced in the New York art scene. Finally, as the AIDS crisis raged on, their friend Keith Haring became an outspoken advocate for gay men, while Warhol privately panicked about the ways in which he might be at risk.</p><div class=\"eloquent-imagery-image\">\n    <div class=\"flex justify-center\">\n        <img class=\"border border-gray-100 h-full\" src=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/03vAnX0NkdSJMD8Gak8JFWG/images-5.fit_lim.size_2000x.v1646865506.jpg\" alt=\"Andy Warhol portrait, with a large shadow cast on the wall behind him.\" srcset=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/03vAnX0NkdSJMD8Gak8JFWG/images-5.fit_lim.size_800x.v1646865506.jpg 800w,https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/03vAnX0NkdSJMD8Gak8JFWG/images-5.fit_lim.size_1400x.v1646865506.jpg 1400w,https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/03vAnX0NkdSJMD8Gak8JFWG/images-5.fit_lim.size_2000x.v1646865506.jpg 1600w\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1408px) 100vw, 1408px\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\">\n\n\n    </div>\n            <div class=\"mt-4 subtitle-2 font-sans text-left\">\n            <span class=\"text-gray-1000 normal-case\"></span>\n            <span class=\"credit text-gray-600 capitalize\">Credit: Netflix</span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<h2>Who is Andy Warhol?&nbsp;</h2><p>There is no simple answer to this deceptively simple question. <i>The Andy Warhol Diaries</i> probe the man behind the myth, but also recognize a diary is not the entirety of a person. Warhol gave so much of himself to the world in his prolific art, his public performance of an artist, in his diaries, and in the colleagues that he boosted and collaborated with. Experts and friends can point to pictures and passages and make pronouncements about who Warhol was, but these pieces do not complete the puzzle. That's by design.&nbsp;</p><p>In the end, Rossi has not spent six episodes dissecting, deifying, or demonizing Warhol. Instead, he explores how one of the most famous man of modern times is still a marvelous mystery, no matter how long we look. In that, there is a lot of beauty and humanity to be treasured for decades to come. </p><p><a href=\"https://zdcs.link/57owx\"><i>The Andy Warhol Diaries </i></a><a href=\"https://zdcs.link/57owx\">is now streaming on Netflix. </a></p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 11 Mar 2022 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":91,"bgimg":"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/03vAnX0NkdSJMD8Gak8JFWG/hero-image.jpg","linkMd5":"0a244b02d3b933cdea7cc97be88a6a95","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn17@2020_1/2022/03/14/08-27-03-975_40663039fd31e6fe.webp","destWidth":1920,"destHeight":1080,"sourceBytes":232171,"destBytes":141816,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/03vAnX0NkdSJMD8Gak8JFWG/hero-image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn17@2020_1/2022/03/14/08-27-03-975_40663039fd31e6fe.webp","https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/03vAnX0NkdSJMD8Gak8JFWG/images-4.fit_lim.size_2000x.v1646865506.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn59@2020_1/2022/03/14/08-27-25-428_441b9bf78c332a79.webp","https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/03vAnX0NkdSJMD8Gak8JFWG/images-1.fit_lim.size_2000x.v1646857812.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn31@2020_3/2022/03/14/08-27-25-721_86fbd4267c8dbb6f.webp","https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/03vAnX0NkdSJMD8Gak8JFWG/images-3.fit_lim.size_2000x.v1646865506.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn84@2020_2/2022/03/14/08-27-24-932_2265fb58374f4046.webp","https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/03vAnX0NkdSJMD8Gak8JFWG/images-2.fit_lim.size_2000x.v1646857812.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn60@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-27-25-007_c5901a9430512e00.webp","https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/03vAnX0NkdSJMD8Gak8JFWG/images-5.fit_lim.size_2000x.v1646865506.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn99@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-27-26-555_6d0b1435657ac0cd.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647246421789},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:27:01","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:27:01","title":"'The Boys' looks as brutal and bloody as ever in this R-rated Season 3 teaser","link":"https://mashable.com/video/the-boys-season-3-trailer","description":"<img src=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/videos/04zHrjygQV0ydHxqczVb1cx/hero-image.png\" alt=\"A still from \" the boys season homelander played by antony starr is seen from below in full costume floating downward. his arms are spread wide and he smiling.><p><i>The Boys</i> are almost back in town.</p><p>On June 3, Amazon Prime Video's subversive superhero series returns for a third season.

The Philips SmartSleep Wake Up Light is on sale for $79.95 at <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/6wWmq\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/4e0WG\">Walmart</a> as of March 10, down a full $20 from its $99.95 MSRP. </p><hr><p>Simply put, sleep is <a href=\"https://healthysleep.med.harvard.edu/healthy/matters/benefits-of-sleep/why-do-we-sleep\">important</a>. Whether it be for our day-to-day functioning, long term development, or overall health, getting a good night's rest goes a long way. Anything that disrupts sleep can be hard to deal with, which is why the arrival of daylight saving time can be such a pain. Yes, it finally won't be dark by 5 p.m., but it will be dark if you're trying to get up even somewhat early in the morning. Between that and our <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/best-youtube-videos-fall-asleep-calming-relaxing\">phones' blue lights</a> we're all staring at until just before we close our eyes, what're our circadian rhythms to do? </p><p>Well, maybe getting some light regulation built into your routine isn't a bad idea. And luckily enough, just before this year's daylight saving time change, the Philips SmartSleep Wake Up Light is on sale for $79.95 at both <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/6wWmq\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/4e0WG\">Walmart</a> (and at the time of writing, completely sold out on Philip's website).</p><p>For those unfamiliar, the Philips wake up light presents a much welcome alternative to blaring alarm clocks in early morning darkness and harsh overhead lighting just before bed. Instead, it's warm-sun colored light pairs with five soothing sounds to simulate the sunset or sunrise in your bedroom every night and morning. For the most peaceful morning possible, the light gradually increases its intensity over a period of 30 minutes as it turns on. If you're not quite ready to get up, it does come equipped with a one-tap snooze feature. </p><p>In addition to its sun simulation, this light also comes equipped with FM radio, a USB charging port, and a nightlight that can be activated with a tap. It may not have all the fanciest smart features, but those can run you up to $200. At the end (and start) of the day, if what you're looking for is a light to held you wind down and calmly wake you up with minimal effort on your part, the Philips SmartSleep Wake Up Light is an excellent option. </p><div class=\"max-w-3xl mx-auto mb-16 font-sans flex flex-col mt-8 md:flex-row\" data-ga-module=\"deal-card\" data-ga-element=\"offer\">\n    <div class=\"w-64 mx-auto md:mx-0 md:w-1/3\">\n                    <a class=\"block\" href=\"https://zdcs.link/6wWmq?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall&amp;short_url=6wWmq&amp;cd36=Standard&amp;t=deals&amp;m=deal-card&amp;e=offer&amp;i=image&amp;el=image\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" data-ga-action=\"product_image\" data-ga-label=\"image\" data-ga-item=\"image\" data-ga-click data-commerce-click>\n                <img class=\"w-full\" src=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/06sOOUTKUQ0xcoFF16Y32BE/images-1.fit_lim.size_256x.jpg\" alt=\"philips smartsleep light \" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1258\">\n            </a>\n            <div class=\"mt-2 leading-none text-left\">\n                                    <span class=\"subtitle-2 text-gray-600 capitalize text-xs pr-5 mt-1\">Credit: Philips </span>\n                            </div>  \n            </div>\n    <div class=\"w-full pl-0 mt-3 md:w-2/3 md:mt-0 md:pl-8\">\n        <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/6wWmq?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall&amp;short_url=6wWmq&amp;cd36=Standard&amp;t=deals&amp;m=deal-card&amp;e=offer&amp;i=title&amp;el=offer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\" class=\"block text-xl font-bold text-secondary-300 mb-5 leading-8 text-center md:text-left hover:underline md:text-2xl\" data-ga-action=\"offer-title\" data-ga-item=\"title\" data-ga-label=\"$text\" data-ga-click data-commerce-click>Philips SmartSleep Wake Up Light</a>\n                    <div class=\"font-bold text-coolgray-900 font-sans text-base leading-6 text-center md:text-lg md:text-left\">$79.95 at Amazon (save $20) </div>\n                <a class=\"font-bold text-center hover:underline leading-6\" href=\"https://zdcs.link/6wWmq?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall&amp;short_url=6wWmq&amp;cd36=Standard&amp;t=deals&amp;m=deal-card&amp;e=offer&amp;i=buy-button&amp;el=offer\" target=\"_blank\" data-ga-action=\"buy-link\" data-ga-item=\"buy-button\" data-ga-label=\"$text\" data-ga-click data-commerce-click> \n            <button class=\"mt-3 inline-block text-base font-bold font-sans btn btn-secondary w-full tracking-wide md:w-auto px-5 md:text-lg\">Get Deal</button>\n        </a>\n    </div>\n</div>\n<h2>Explore related content: </h2><ul><li><p><a href=\"https://mashable.com/roundup/best-smart-light-bulbs-for-smart-home\">The lighting is always flattering with the best smart bulbs &mdash; these are our faves</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://mashable.com/roundup/best-pillows-to-help-you-sleep-better\">The best pillows for a good night's sleep after a doomscrolling session</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://mashable.com/roundup/best-smart-speakers-amazon-reviews\">The best smart speakers: See where the Amazon Echo Dot, others rank</a></p></li></ul>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 10 Mar 2022 16:18:14 +0000","feedId":91,"bgimg":"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/06sOOUTKUQ0xcoFF16Y32BE/hero-image.jpg","linkMd5":"1342adefa4754151a3d1bd89aa7a8068","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn84@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-27-02-563_d32348ae973e9364.webp","destWidth":1080,"destHeight":608,"sourceBytes":28370,"destBytes":28370,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/06sOOUTKUQ0xcoFF16Y32BE/hero-image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn84@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-27-02-563_d32348ae973e9364.webp","https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/06sOOUTKUQ0xcoFF16Y32BE/images-1.fit_lim.size_256x.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn56@2020_3/2022/03/14/08-27-26-135_22e482f0be57780f.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647246421774},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:27:01","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:27:01","title":"The best dating sites and apps for women","link":"https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-dating-sites-women-uk","description":"<img src=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/roundups/04jrjFc43vLrLwlDTBGS3va/hero-image.jpg\" alt=\"Women staring into sunset\"><p>The online world isn't always the friendliest of places for women, particularly when it comes to trolling and misogyny on social media. From Twitter <u><a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/twitter-reply-guys\">reply guys</a></u>, to other forms of online harassment, to straight up cyberstalking, letting women exist in peace seems to be a hard concept to grasp. </p><p>When it comes to <a href=\"https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-dating-sites-uk\">dating apps</a> specifically &mdash;&nbsp;where others often assume that a dating app profile means that one is willfully subjecting themselves to creepy comments &mdash; the chance of women enduring such unsettling experiences feels doubled. The onslaught of men grasping at straws for attention with messages saying \"think they saw you somewhere\" or requesting nudes in their opening line is an online dating specialty.</p><p>Is it easier to shoot your shot by simply using a hot selfie on your Instagram story as bait for your crush? That's a classic tactic that'll never die. But unless you and said crush are already in some sort of flirtationship and already follow each other on social media, finding love, a hookup, or someone to grab a drink with could happen a lot faster with the right dating app (as opposed to waiting to meet someone at work or agreeing to a blind date). </p><p>This means not deleting and re-downloading Tinder after every breakup or every time you ghost (or get ghosted by) your current entanglement.&nbsp;Tinder can truly be a great place to meet genuine people who are open to getting serious, to find a reliable friend with benefits, or to get a good-old-fashioned confidence boost from a mutual right swipe. But if you're frustrated with horny users disguising themselves as relationship seekers or relationship seekers who can't handle it when you say you're just looking for a hookup, opting for a dating site more finely-tuned to what you're looking for means you'll spend less time dealing with people who aren't looking for the same thing.&nbsp;</p><p>Maybe you can't stand starting every conversation from scratch. Maybe your biggest fear is ending up on a date with someone who doesn't care about cats. Instead of a lazy bio, dating apps that delve into someone's hobbies, favourite movies, career goals, or political views before even talking to them opens up a wealth of clever ice breakers, and ensures that you aren't going into things blindly.&nbsp;</p><h2><b>How are dating apps trying to make dating safer?</b></h2><p>Meeting someone from the internet in person for the first time is nerve-wracking for anyone. But for women, it can dredge up the same fear that occurs when walking alone past a big group of men.&nbsp;</p><p>Match Group is making strides toward a safer dating experience: Tinder was the first to unveil new features coming out of its partnership with <u><a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/tinder-noonlight-safety-features-photo-verification\">Noonlight</a></u>, a safety app that tracks the location of users and notifies authorities if there are concerns. Before heading out on a date, Tinder users can log info about where they're going and who they're meeting, as well as hit a panic button to alert authorities if there's an emergency. </p><p>Match Group plans to roll out the same features for its other apps, like Hinge and OkCupid, later. In March 2021, Tinder announced plans to let users run a <u><a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/tinder-background-check-garbo\">background check</a></u> on their matches.</p><h2><b>How has the pandemic changed dating?</b></h2><p>COVID changed online dating dynamics forever. Being vaccinated becoming a genuine turn-on is the obvious addition to 2022 dating checklists, but there's something about dating discourse that we think could positively affect communication between strangers in the long run.</p><p>Waiting to meet each other and getting to know a match through FaceTime is kind of the norm now &mdash; and <u><a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/post-pandemic-dating-sex-dating-app-survey\">people don't really want that to change</a></u>, even once the pandemic has fully subsided. For the women who'd prefer to gather crumbs of someone's vibe before meeting in person, online dating's <u><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2020/4/3/21198794/coronavirus-video-dating-tinder-hinge-grindr\">shift to video dating</a></u> in 2020 could prove comforting. It goes without saying that you're never required to <u><a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/dating-app-meet-harassment-coronavirus-social-distance\">meet up with a match</a></u> in person immediately, but it'd be nice not to be pestered about it.</p><p>The communication skills gained through hashing out COVID-related issues aren't nothing, either. People have gotten comfortable with bringing up personal boundaries and bonding over universal anxieties with someone they met on a dating app &mdash; both of which could benefit women online. <u><a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/tinder-future-of-dating-is-fluid-report-2021\">Tinder</a></u> thinks the honesty will carry over when things are back to normal, and hopefully the creeps will continue to weed themselves out.&nbsp;</p><h2><b>Should you consider using free dating apps?</b></h2><p>There are plenty of free dating sites and apps out there, and the likes of Tinder and Hinge are popular options with massive networks of users. You can easily enter the online dating game without spending anything, but you get what you pay for with dating sites and apps. </p><p>For the best experience with the greatest possibility of finding exactly what you're looking for, you are probably going to need to cough up some cash. The best dating sites don't come cheap, and whilst you can still find a hookup with a free app, you should upgrade is you're looking for compatibility tests, chat rooms, videos, and a greater level of control. </p><h2><b>What are the best dating sites for women?</b></h2><p>Whether you're looking for a <a href=\"https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-hookup-apps-uk\">fun time</a> or your next <a href=\"https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-dating-sites-for-serious-relationships-uk\">long-term relationship</a>, we have picked out a wide range of apps and sites for different types of daters. So whatever you're looking for, we have you covered with this guide.</p><p>We have done the tough stuff, looked at all the <a href=\"https://www.datingadvice.com/online-dating/online-dating-statistics\">facts and figures</a>, and worked out which sites are the best options for every single type of woman out there.

That's 20% less than its regular price of $988.</p><hr><p>DJI is the leading brand for camera drones for a reason &mdash; their Hasselblad cameras, automated flight features, and intuitive controls are an industry standard other brands struggle to live up to. Their models populate just about every \"<u><a href=\"https://mashable.com/roundup/best-drones-with-cameras\">Best Drones</a></u>\" list, to widespread professional and amateur videographer consensus alike.</p><p>While these drones come at a range of price points, from the sub-$300<a href=\"https://zdcs.link/NX2ZD\"> </a><u><a href=\"https://zdcs.link/NX2ZD\">Mini SE</a></u> to the just-under-$3,000<a href=\"https://zdcs.link/lLGdX\"> </a><u><a href=\"https://zdcs.link/lLGdX\">Inspire 2</a></u>, they definitely sit on the pricier side of things &mdash; which is why a deal this good is hard to pass up.</p><h3>Why the DJI Mavic Air 2 Fly More Combo is a great buy</h3><p>The<a href=\"https://zdcs.link/bZkAG\"> </a><u><a href=\"https://zdcs.link/bZkAG\">Mavic Air 2</a></u> is a perfect example of DJI's brand reputation. Not only does it have a powerful camera (capable of 4K/60fps video, 48MP photo, and 8K hyperlapse), it also has various shooting modes to spice up your videography. And did we mention their excellent insurance coverage? I flew mine into the ocean the first time I took it out and got a brand new one delivered, no questions asked.</p><p>If there's one drawback to this versatile, powerful drone, it's that the battery life lasts 34 minutes &mdash; this is fairly long in comparison to other drones in the market, but it's never fun to lug a camera around on a six-hour hike for just half an hour of footage. This is where the Fly More combo comes in &mdash; it includes two extra batteries, three pairs of extra propellers, a battery charging hub (so that you don't have to switch out all three batteries one by one), battery to power bank adapter, and an ND filters set (for the camera), all in a padded shoulder bag designed to protect the drone.</p><h3>Seriously, this is a really good deal</h3><p>The Fly More package alone is worth $199, but with the 20% discount, the Mavic Air 2 Fly More Combo (drone + Fly More accessories) is actually $10 less than just the drone itself, which means you get all those add-ons for free <i>and</i> an extra $10 off the unit itself.</p><div class=\"max-w-3xl mx-auto mb-16 font-sans flex flex-col mt-8 md:flex-row\" data-ga-module=\"deal-card\"

Dobrik, the puckish subject of Casey Neistat&rsquo;s documentary <i>Under the Influence</i>, first crystallizes on screen during a high-pressure pitch to Netflix. It's 2020, and the then 24-year-old sits in front of a laptop, his eyes shining with anticipation as he describes his dream gig: a serotonin supercut of a late-night variety show. \"Do you watch <i>Extreme Makeover: Home Edition</i> or any of those reaction shows?\" he asks representatives from the streaming giant. \"You're really just waiting for that <i>final</i> moment. I kind of wish that there was a show that just skipped all that.\" He gestures urgently, \"I just want to get to that final moment, I want to be there <i>constantly.</i>\"</p><p>Dobrik has made a career out of chasing those \"final moments\" on camera, uploading breakneck, stake-raising romps often enhanced by alcohol and sex to YouTube. His videos have earned him more than <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmh5gdwCx6lN7gEC20leNVA\">18 million subscribers</a>, a show on Discovery+, and enough money to be crowned one of the <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/maddieberg/2020/12/18/the-highest-paid-youtube-stars-of-2020/?sh=7467a9bf6e50\">highest-paid YouTube creators</a> of 2020. His success has also made stars of a recurring cast of more than 15 friends collectively called the \"Vlog Squad.\" Most now have their own social media followings, merchandise, and brand sponsorships as a result of their affiliation with Dobrik and appearances in his videos.</p><div class=\"eloquent-imagery-image\">\n    <div class=\"flex justify-center\">\n        <img class=\"border border-gray-100 h-full\" src=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/00c35ddHD9FfjYru335EVJ5/images-1.fit_lim.size_2000x.v1647032871.jpg\" alt=\"Casey Neistat, in sunglasses, and David Dobrik pictured in Neistat's New York City studio.\" srcset=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/00c35ddHD9FfjYru335EVJ5/images-1.fit_lim.size_800x.v1647032871.jpg 800w,https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/00c35ddHD9FfjYru335EVJ5/images-1.fit_lim.size_1400x.v1647032871.jpg 1400w,https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/00c35ddHD9FfjYru335EVJ5/images-1.fit_lim.size_2000x.v1647032871.jpg 1600w\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1408px) 100vw, 1408px\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\">\n\n\n    </div>\n            <div class=\"mt-4 subtitle-2 font-sans text-left\">\n            <span class=\"text-gray-1000 normal-case\">Casey Neistat and David Dobrik in a still from a May 2017 YouTube video posted to Dobrik's second channel.</span>\n            <span class=\"credit text-gray-600 capitalize\">Credit: David Dobrik</span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p><i>Under the Influence</i> examines Dobrik's explosive rise to fame and inevitable reckoning in 2021 after two career-defining events: a March <u><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/vlog-squad-durte-dom-rape-allegation-david-dobrik-zeglaitis-video-2021-3?_ga=2.75570709.1077159610.1647012740-1795715067.1647012740\">report from Insider</a></u><i> </i>alleging that Dobrik was complicit in the 2018 sexual assault of a college student who appeared in his vlogs; and the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msWUXM-GQXk\">April reveal</a> of a 2020 accident that left a member of his Vlog Squad with a cracked skull, brain damage, and double vision in one eye.</p><p>The documentary is directed by Neistat, a filmmaker who, from 2015 to 2016, honed a daily vlog style that redefined the genre on YouTube. His snappy, vibrant portraits of his global travels and New York City gambols inspired Dobrik, who found success with his own brand of semi-scripted vlogs combining <i>Jackass</i>-type stunts, stand-up comedy, and reality television. \"Casey [was] my favorite vlogger on YouTube [until] about two years ago, and then I started and I just took over,\" Dobrik joked in a <u><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa7BvzZZP0g\">video</a></u> with Neistat from 2017. \"That would be funny if it wasn't the truth,\" Neistat countered.</p><div class=\"w-full mx-auto max-w-3xl font-sans mt-8 text-lg leading-loose md:text-xl md:leading-7\">\n        <span class=\"font-bold text-primary-400\">SEE ALSO:</span>\n        <a href=\"https://mashable.com/video/casey-neistat-most-expensive-plane-ticket\" class=\"text-secondary-300\">\n            Casey Neistat shows us what it's like flying on the 'most expensive plane ticket in the world'\n                            <svg class=\"ml-1 w-4 h-4 fill-current inline-block font-normal\"><use href=\"/images/icons/spritemap.svg#sprite-arrow-right-thin\"></use></svg>\n                    </a>\n    </div>\n<p>Despite Neistat and Dobrik's friendly relationship as contemporaries &mdash; or perhaps because of it &mdash; <i>Under the Influence </i>is a balanced and compelling chronicle of the ways in which power warps, incentivizes, and exploits the motivations of everyone in its orbit.&nbsp;</p><p>Dobrik's content relies mainly on the willingness of the Vlog Squad to perform: as crude caricatures, amateur stunt people, and supportive hype men. Safety and consent seem to come second to getting the shot, if they're considered at all. In the doc, Dobrik notes that a vlog he's filming is \"not funny, unless someone gets hurt.&rdquo; His assistant Natalie Mariduena calls herself \"Safety Sally\" but is later shown pressuring Vlog Squad member Corinna Kopf to remove her shirt while filming a fake party scene in a private jet, even after Kopf expresses her discomfort with the idea.&nbsp;</p><p>The Vlog Squad have made a lot of money by putting their lives on the line and sacrificing their dignity in front of Dobrik's audience of millions.

Dobrik is illegally operating an excavator on a shallow lake in Utah. Vlog Squad member Jeff Wittek, who made his first appearance in Dobrik's videos in 2018, is attached to the crane by a thin rope, swinging in a circle, when Dobrik panics and stops the machine. Wittek crashes into its metal arm and dangles upside down from the rope, his head below water, floundering as he waits to be rescued.</p><p>\"People are gonna say you're a fucking idiot for getting on that rope and allowing somebody to control your life like that,\" says Wittek, whose face has been reconstructed and whose brain and eyesight are permanently damaged. \"I wasn't thinking about it like that.

It's hard to say. In June 2021, he made his return to YouTube, Vlog Squad in tow, with videos that usually rack up more than 9 million views each. Sponsors like SeatGeek have returned to finance him. And he's promoting his Discovery+ series <i>Discovering David Dobrik</i>. Though Dobrik continues to spar publicly with Wittek and recently opened up about the <u><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRMQg2dEo_0&amp;feature=emb_title\">rocky state of his mental health</a></u>, the 25-year-old remains more successful than almost anyone his age. Most importantly, he still has millions of young people following his every move.</p><p>As it weaves a complex tapestry of power, abuse, and coercion, <i>Under the Influence </i>also communicates the scope and seriousness of Dobrik's global influence beyond YouTube. Among other ventures, Dobrik has developed a perfume and a photo-sharing app, and has a pizza chain in the works. He transcends the platform that made him famous, and so does his impact on the people who watch his videos. Netflix ends up passing on Dobrik's show because \"they don't see how a YouTuber can transition into that world.\" Neistat knows that Dobrik already has.&nbsp;</p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Sun, 13 Mar 2022 02:25:00 +0000","feedId":91,"bgimg":"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/00c35ddHD9FfjYru335EVJ5/hero-image.jpg","linkMd5":"c8026e79527f1ca1f2dce70e5812ae45","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn71@2020_5/2022/03/14/08-27-01-945_ebfea78ce16a399c.webp","destWidth":960,"destHeight":540,"sourceBytes":22990,"destBytes":22990,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/00c35ddHD9FfjYru335EVJ5/hero-image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn71@2020_5/2022/03/14/08-27-01-945_ebfea78ce16a399c.webp","https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/00c35ddHD9FfjYru335EVJ5/images-1.fit_lim.size_2000x.v1647032871.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn23@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-27-24-902_91d247353cd5accb.webp","https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/00c35ddHD9FfjYru335EVJ5/images-2.fit_lim.size_2000x.v1647032871.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn87@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-27-25-504_46627b8204dfdc1a.webp","https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/00c35ddHD9FfjYru335EVJ5/images-3.fit_lim.size_2000x.v1647033814.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn27@2020_2/2022/03/14/08-27-24-954_36b5a7fd41d3c857.webp","https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/00c35ddHD9FfjYru335EVJ5/images-4.fit_lim.size_2000x.v1647035795.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn24@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-27-24-934_7fdc6ce48c575d91.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647246421782},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:27:01","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:27:01","title":"Jane Campion calls Sam Elliott a 'B-I-T-C-H' over his 'The Power of the Dog' comments","link":"https://mashable.com/article/jane-campion-responds-sam-elliott-sexist-power-dog","description":"<img src=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/04E0SnTSDYYe1rWdr7kbBZ5/hero-image.jpg\" alt=\"Jane Campion attends \" the power of dog screening in hollywood><p>It appears the battle over who gets to tell (and critique) the traditionally hyper-masculine stories portrayed in American Westerns is alive and, well, annoyingly sexist in 2022.</p><p>On Saturday, March 12, Academy Award-winning director Jane Campion put actor Sam Elliott on blast for derogatory remarks he made recently about her new cowboy movie <i>The</i> <i>Power of the Dog </i>on the <a href=\"http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episode-1309-sam-elliott\">February 28 episode of Marc Maron's </a><a href=\"http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episode-1309-sam-elliott\"><i>WTF</i></a><a href=\"http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episode-1309-sam-elliott\"> podcast</a>.

The actor continued with other questionable justifications for his dislike of the New Zealand director's take on an American Western, which notably earned Campion one of the top awards at Saturday's ceremony and which also seems like a shoe-in to win at least some of the 12 Academy Award nominations it's up for this year, including one for Best Director.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <a class=\"text-gray-600\" href=\"https://twitter.com/Variety/status/1502839949212545028\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tweet may have been deleted</a>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\"He was being a bit of a B-I-T-C-H,\" <a href=\"https://variety.com/2022/film/news/jane-campion-says-sam-elliott-is-being-a-b-i-t-c-h-with-slam-against-the-power-of-the-dog-1235203098/\">she told Variety when asked about the comments</a>. \"I'm sorry to say it, but Sam's not a cowboy. He's an actor.\"</p><p>Campion went on to call out the underlying misogyny of Elliott questioning her right to subvert the American myths embedded in the Western genre, which he claimed rubbed him the wrong way because she's a foreigner who shot the movie in her home country of New Zealand. \"What the fuck does this woman &mdash; she&rsquo;s a brilliant director by the way, I love her work, previous work &mdash; but what the fuck does this woman from down there know about the American west?\" he raged to Maron.</p><p>As Campion rebutted, though, \"The West is a mythic space and there&rsquo;s a lot of room on the range...

Further, Elliott's comments ignore the highly relevant detail that Taiwanese-American filmmaker Ang Lee won an Oscar himself for 2005's even more explicitly homoerotic cowboy movie, <i>Brokeback Mountain</i>.</p><div class=\"w-full mx-auto max-w-3xl font-sans mt-8 text-lg leading-loose md:text-xl md:leading-7\">\n        <span class=\"font-bold text-primary-400\">SEE ALSO:</span>\n        <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/the-power-of-the-dog-review\" class=\"text-secondary-300\">\n            Benedict Cumberbatch seems wrong for 'The Power of the Dog,' but proves wickedly right\n                            <svg class=\"ml-1 w-4 h-4 fill-current inline-block font-normal\"><use href=\"/images/icons/spritemap.svg#sprite-arrow-right-thin\"></use></svg>\n                    </a>\n    </div>\n<ul><li><p><a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/where-to-stream-the-2022-oscar-nominees\"><b>How to watch the 2022 Oscar-nominated films from home</b></a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://mashable.com/video/turning-red-pixar\"><b>'Turning Red''s creators on how the coming of age Pixar film captures teen angst</b></a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/best-movies-sundance-now\"><b>15 of the best movies on Sundance Now for when you want something special</b></a></p></li></ul><p>With all that missing context, Elliott's disrespectful dismissal of Campion's take on such an inherently international genre sounds a lot more like grasping for slightly less bigoted excuses explaining why he thinks American Westerns shouldn't be queer or directed by women.</p><p>\"I consider myself a creator,\" Campion continued. \"And I think [Elliott] sees me as a woman or something less first.

That means it's time to put on your thinking caps and dive into the deeply rich history of women, both past and present. </p><p>The National Women's History Alliance chooses the month's theme each year, and 2022's focus is \"<u><a href=\"https://nationalwomenshistoryalliance.org/2022-theme/\">Women Providing Healing, Promoting Hope</a></u>.\" According to the organization's website, the choice of theme is \"a tribute to the ceaseless work of caregivers and frontline workers during this ongoing pandemic and also a recognition of the thousands of ways that women of all cultures have provided both healing and hope throughout history.\"</p><p>The origins of Women's History Month <u><a href=\"https://www.womenshistory.org/womens-history/womens-history-month\">stretch back to 1978</a></u> when the Education Task Force of the Sonoma County (California) Commission on the Status of Women <u><a href=\"https://www.history.com/topics/holidays/womens-history-month\">organized a \"Women's History Week\"</a></u> in March. After an association of women's groups and historians, led by the National Women's History Alliance (then the National Women's History Project), <a href=\"https://www.womenshistory.org/womens-history/womens-history-month#:~:text=Since%20many%20of%20the%20women's,Vote%3A%20Refusing%20to%20Be%20Silenced.\">successfully lobbied for national recognition in 1980</a>, the week of March 8th became National Women&rsquo;s History Week. And in 1987, Congress passed a law declaring March Women's History Month. </p><p>For too long, women's stories and contributions have been left out of our national narrative, says Jennifer Herrera, vice president of external affairs at the National Women's History Museum.</p><p>\"History is only as complete as the stories we teach, share, and learn. Women&rsquo;s history is exciting and inspiring and empowering, and by including women&rsquo;s voices and women&rsquo;s stories, we&rsquo;re telling a more inclusive, representative, and accurate history,\" she says.</p><p>With all that in mind, Mashable reached out to various organizations &mdash; including the National Women's History Museum, the National Women's History Alliance, the New-York Historical Society's Center for Women's History, the National Women's Hall of Fame, and the Smithsonian's Women's History Initiative &mdash; to curate a list of engaging resources that elevate the largely untold stories of underrepresented women.

As an entirely online museum (though, it's working to open a physical location in D.C. in 2022), it's well poised to boost your knowledge about women who contributed to history from afar.</p><p>In the museum's <a href=\"https://www.womenshistory.org/students-and-educators/biographies\">Biographies</a> section, for example, you can learn about both historical and contemporary women who broke barriers, including poet <a href=\"https://www.womenshistory.org/education-resources/biographies/maya-angelou\">Maya Angelou</a>, Supreme Court Justice <a href=\"https://www.womenshistory.org/education-resources/biographies/ruth-bader-ginsburg\">Ruth Bader Ginsburg</a>, the first Native American United States poet laureate <a href=\"https://www.womenshistory.org/education-resources/biographies/joy-harjo\">Joy Harjo</a>, and filmmaker <a href=\"https://www.womenshistory.org/education-resources/biographies/ava-duvernay\">Ava DuVernay</a>. </p><p>Its collection of <a href=\"https://www.womenshistory.org/womens-history/online-exhibits\">online exhibits</a> explore themes within women's history. It also profiles some of the women included within its biographies but includes more visual elements like photos and drawings. You can learn the names and stories of women who were an <a href=\"https://www.womenshistory.org/exhibits/women-nasa\">integral part of NASA</a>, sympathize with the struggles <a href=\"https://www.womenshistory.org/exhibits/representation-hyphen-latinas-fight-womens-suffrage\">Latina and Hispanic suffragists endured</a>, or delve into the fascinating life of abolitionist <a href=\"https://www.womenshistory.org/exhibits/harriet-tubman\">Harriet Tubman</a>. And that's only a taste of what's available. </p><p>During the COVID-19 lockdown, the museum hosted the Sundays@Home series, which offered virtual education, author talks, panel discussions, and more, all about trailblazing women throughout history. You can still view recordings from past events on the <u><a href=\"https://www.womenshistory.org/public-programs-events/nwhm-presents/sundayshome\">Sundays@Home webpage</a></u>.</p><p>For 2022, the museum wants visitors to download and use its <u><a href=\"https://www.womenshistory.org/sites/default/files/document/2022-03/NWHM%20Women%27s%20History%20Month%20Resource%20Toolkit%202022_1.pdf\">Women's History Month Toolkit</a></u>, which is intended for everyone \"from individuals, educators, and students, to small nonprofits and large businesses,\" the organization explains.

She told Mashable that through the series, she hopes to highlight women who were often the first in their fields, particularly those of color who faced additional hurdles due to racism and sexism.</p><p>Mangin and her team assembled a board of 13 academic advisors to ensure historical accuracy, cultural sensitivity, and help select the 26 women featured in the shorts.</p><p>UNLADYLIKE2020 also offers a free history curriculum and lesson plans based on the 26 women profiled.

The history lessons cover a lot of information, but all of it focuses on the role of women and women's narratives frequently left out of history courses.

As our lives have moved online in recent years, digital dating has allowed us more freedom to meet others how we choose.</p><p>The only real issue with online dating is that there are a lot of sites and apps out there to consider. With so many options, it can be really tricky knowing where to find the best crop of potential partners. Each of the dating apps on offer has a selection of features that will matter differently to you depending on your lifestyle, what you want, and what's most important to you. It's simply a case of finding something that works for you.</p><h2><b>What should you include on your dating profile?</b></h2><p>In many cases, the amount of information you can get from <a href=\"https://sociologicalscience.com/download/vol-4/september/SocSci_v4_490to510.pdf\">detailed profiles</a> is more than what would be covered in the \"traditional\" period of getting to know someone. The whole \"do you want to have babies\" thing is a huge piece of information that could decide your future with someone, but it's very possible that such a weighty subject won't be brought up until you've caught feelings or met their parents.</p><p>However, many dating sites ask about kids &mdash;&nbsp;whether you want them or already have them &mdash;&nbsp;during the sign-up process (as well as other potentially-awkward questions), and probably won't match you with someone who has different goals than you do. Similarly, some of OkCupid's matching is rooted in political and social justice views. Will you find out if someone opposes vaccinations on the first date? Probably not, but OkCupid won't send you to get a beer with someone you'd start a fight with on Facebook.</p><p>Plus, it's always nice when your current booty call doesn't suck as a person. Even if you're just in it for <a href=\"https://mashable.com/roundup/best-hookup-apps-uk\">something frisky and fleeting</a>, the personality you can gather from a simple bio might let you know who's worthy of your time &mdash;&nbsp;even if that time is strictly within \"You up?\" hours.</p><p>Julie Spira, dating expert and CEO of <a href=\"https://cyberdatingexpert.com/\">cyberdatingexpert.com</a>, says it wasn't always so easy to meet people online. She would know &mdash;&nbsp;she's been helping clients find love online since 1994.</p><p>\"People didn&rsquo;t have mobile phones and laptops, and the process was people would go home, log on slowly, see who had written to them and write back,\" she says. \"The courtship process was a lot slower, so it took quite a while to get from the first interaction to actually going on a date. Plus in those days, there was a stigma associated with online dating. You did not tell people you met your spouse, or partner, or even a date online.\"</p><p>The rhetoric has clearly come a long way since then, and the digital dating landscape has evolved with people's changing needs. OkCupid realised that the way a potential match votes matters romantically to a lot of people. Women were tired of men blowing up their messages with creepy first-liners, so Bumble came along. \"Tindering\" is now a verb, but it's far from your only option.</p><h2><b>What are the benefits of using a dating site?</b></h2><p>If you're lucky, you'll find a perfect match right away, but that's not usually how it works out. While you do know more about online matches than you would a stranger you met in person, there's only so much a quick dating profile can tell you.</p><p><a href=\"https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-dating-sites-women-uk\">Dating sites and apps</a> can make finding a compatible potential partner easier, but it's still dating. Not everyone is going to be a gem. While apps like Bumble let you display what kind of relationship you're looking for, others don't, so you might end up going out with someone only to realise you're not looking for the same thing.</p><p>That said, there will be people on dating sites who are looking for the same thing as you. And using a dating app to find them is a hell of a lot easier than going up to strangers on the street or in bars and asking if they're looking for a relationship. Apps and dating websites expand your dating pool and allow you to meet people with similar interests you might not run into naturally in your everyday life. You just might need a little patience to find The One.</p><p>We haven't reached full <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/future-online-dating\">AI-based or gene matchmaking</a> just yet, but many modern features facilitating more meaningful matches (or quicker, safer hookups) have sprung up even in the past five years.</p><h2><b>What is the best dating site?</b></h2><p>Whether you're looking for something specific or a site that ticks every box, we have produced a handy guide that gives you all of the essential details.

Join the club.</p><p>If you just can't quit thinking about Lumon and are impatiently waiting for Season 1, Episode 5 to drop, you've come to the right place. Apple TV+ shared an exclusive look at <i>Severance</i>'s March 11 episode, \"The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design,\" with Mashable, and it looks like another doozy.</p><p>The clip, titled \"Irving's Nightmare,\" shows Irving (John Turturro) dozing on the job again. A plop of cryptic black sludge lands on his right hand, and he looks up to see it seeping in from the light fixtures. After sludge starts raining down from the office ceiling, Mark (Adam Scott) peers around the cubicle to check on Irv. For a brief (extremely cursed) moment, Mark's eye starts leaking black goop. Thankfully, Irving wakes up a few seconds later and the nightmare comes to an end.</p><p>We first saw Irv fall asleep on the job in Episode 2, \"Half Loop.\" Once he slipped into a stressful slumber, a mess of black sludge (that looks a lot like the sludge from <i>Severance</i>'s opening sequence) started seeping down his cubicle, creeping across his desk, and overtaking his keyboard. He screamed himself awake, was sent for a wellness check with Ms. Casey, and met Burt (Christopher Walken) in the hallway. </p><p>What will come from Irving's latest nightmare? And will we finally find out what's up with all the goop?

photo of Valve's Steam Deck sitting on a wooden table.\"><p>Valve's Steam Deck is an impressive piece of gaming tech, but there's definitely a learning curve.</p><p>Even if you're familiar with the Steam store, and its TV-friendly \"Big Picture Mode\" that the Deck's SteamOS resembles, it still takes time to figure out how basic features from Steam on PC translate to the portable device's gamepad-style controls. It's easier than you might think at first, though.</p><p>Valve doesn't make it apparent up front, but Steam Deck users have a ton of button-based shortcuts they can lean on for help. All of those shortcuts involve holding the \"Steam\" button in tandem with one of the other buttons to produce different effects. Like I said, easy stuff.</p><p>The most important one to know <i>just</i> involves the Steam button. If you press and hold it at virtually any time, a whole list of all the available shortcuts pops up until you release the button. So for those times when you forget &mdash; like I have numerous times &mdash; you can refresh your memory painlessly, without having to turn to an internet search engine.</p><div class=\"eloquent-imagery-image\">\n    <div class=\"flex justify-center\">\n        <img class=\"border border-gray-100 h-full\" src=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/008v1OvybtqhgSQug8MAmNd/images-1.fit_lim.size_2000x.v1647200326.png\" alt=\"A screenshot of the Steam Deck's list of shortcut commands.\" srcset=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/008v1OvybtqhgSQug8MAmNd/images-1.fit_lim.size_800x.v1647200326.png 800w,https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/008v1OvybtqhgSQug8MAmNd/images-1.fit_lim.size_1400x.v1647200326.png 1400w,https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/008v1OvybtqhgSQug8MAmNd/images-1.fit_lim.size_2000x.v1647200326.png 1600w\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1408px) 100vw, 1408px\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1250\">\n\n\n    </div>\n            <div class=\"mt-4 subtitle-2 font-sans text-left\">\n            <span class=\"text-gray-1000 normal-case\"></span>\n            <span class=\"credit text-gray-600 capitalize\">Credit: Valve / Screenshot by Mashable</span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>In terms of what I've used most, the Take Screenshot shortcut (Steam + R1) captures whatever is on your screen and loads it into an on-device library. If you want to then make your screenshots accessible on a computer (or some other device where you have Steam installed), you can easily send them to the cloud. Head to the Steam Deck's Media menu, highlight the screenshot you want to upload, press the Options button, and select Upload. That's it!</p><p>The virtual keyboard shortcut is also extremely useful for the many Steam Deck-supported games that require occasional typing. Just press Steam + X to summon a smartphone-style keyboard in a flash.</p><p>There's one catch, however. The virtual keyboard only works when Steam is actually running. In the standard SteamOS mode, that means you can call up the keyboard from virtually anywhere. But the feature is more limited if you're using the Windows-style \"Desktop Mode.\" It still works in apps like Chrome, but you'll need to have the desktop version of Steam running in the background (there's an icon for it on the desktop). You probably won't use the feature too often in desktop, but it's useful for those times when you want to install non-Steam apps like Discord.</p><p>You can also tweak the screen brightness in an instant &mdash; which can help preserve battery life &mdash; by holding that Steam button and tilting the left thumbstick up or down to increase or decrease brightness, respectively. </p><div class=\"w-full mx-auto max-w-3xl font-sans mt-8 text-lg leading-loose md:text-xl md:leading-7\">\n        <span class=\"font-bold text-primary-400\">SEE ALSO:</span>\n        <a href=\"https://mashable.com/review/steam-deck-review-valve\" class=\"text-secondary-300\">\n            Valve's big swing with Steam Deck is a hit, but it's not a home run\n                            <svg class=\"ml-1 w-4 h-4 fill-current inline-block font-normal\"><use href=\"/images/icons/spritemap.svg#sprite-arrow-right-thin\"></use></svg>\n                    </a>\n    </div>\n<ul><li><p><a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/steam-deck-how-to-check-compatible-games\"><b>How to see if your favorite games will work on Steam Deck</b></a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/itchio-what-is-it\"><b>What is Itch.io?

Games mess up from time to time, and Steam Deck won't always be able to fix it for you. It's easy enough to reboot by pressing and holding the Power button, but the Steam + B \"Force Game Shutdown\" command gives you another option. I've used it plenty.</p><p>Take the time to dig through the menus if you've been lucky enough to score a Steam Deck. There's a lot of not-so-visible features that are easy to miss if you're not looking for them.</p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Sun, 13 Mar 2022 19:39:39 +0000","feedId":91,"bgimg":"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/008v1OvybtqhgSQug8MAmNd/hero-image.jpg","linkMd5":"c1bf60852cc1e9447e6a9f12b7b1a33c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn89@2020_5/2022/03/14/08-27-03-061_e6c22bf83d7176de.webp","destWidth":2500,"destHeight":1406,"sourceBytes":438472,"destBytes":438472,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/008v1OvybtqhgSQug8MAmNd/hero-image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn89@2020_5/2022/03/14/08-27-03-061_e6c22bf83d7176de.webp","https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/008v1OvybtqhgSQug8MAmNd/images-1.fit_lim.size_2000x.v1647200326.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn24@2020_2/2022/03/14/08-27-25-299_3b36ec27b1510959.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647246421740},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:27:01","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:27:01","title":"Save 37% on a Dyson dupe cordless vacuum that rivals the real thing","link":"https://mashable.com/deals/march-13-jashen-cordless-vacuum-cleaner","description":"<img src=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/00GidVEjlE2myJ2pxVRLBom/hero-image.jpg\" alt=\"Person using blue cordless vacuum cleaner to clean white floor in kitchen\"><p><b>TL;DR: </b>The <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/WlWWN\">JASHEN V18 350W Cordless Vacuum Cleaner</a> is on sale for $209.99 as of March 13, making it 37% off its regular price of $336.</p><hr><p><a href=\"https://mashable.com/roundup/best-dyson-vacuums\">Dyson vacuums</a> might have a cool factor associated with them, but it&rsquo;s hard to justify their prices.

The <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/WlWWN\">Jashen V18</a> appears to be a worthy Dyson dupe, however, with many positive <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/09/cnn-underscored/jashen-v18-review/index.html\">reviews</a> across the web. And right now, it&rsquo;s on sale for over $100 off.</p><p><a href=\"https://mashable.com/deals/june-18-jashen-v18-350w-cordless-vacuum-cleaner\">Featured</a> on Mashable before, the Jashen V18 is a super lightweight (just over six pounds) cordless vacuum that boasts impressive suction comparable to the Dyson V8, useful smart capabilities, and a battery life that offers 40 minutes of non-stop cleaning time. It's similar to Dyson&rsquo;s iconic stick vacuum aesthetic and modular design that can be transformed into a handheld model in an instant.&nbsp;</p><p>If you have both carpet and hard floors in your home, you can easily swap the brush to suit your needs. The brush roller for carpet sits low to the ground, creating higher suction with zero opening and digging deeper into the carpet. The soft roller sits higher off the ground, allowing it to suck up larger dirt and debris on hard floors.</p><p>The Jashen boasts a four-stage filtration system designed to capture 99.99 percent of the fine dust in your home.

Standing desks and fancy chairs cost a pretty penny. But there are ways you can improve your setup if you sit in a chair all day for work &mdash; like adding the <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/GxKPK\">Cubii Cushii Lumbar Cushion</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The Cubii Cushii is designed to help you sit with better posture by reducing stress placed on your lower back. Over time, this can help prevent muscle fatigue and tightness and increase blood flow to the body. That means potentially less pain and fewer back cramps when you get up from your office chair.</p><p>It's an easy way for people who have to sit at their computers all day to make their setup more comfortable without spending a fortune. Or it could even be used for anyone who needs some extra support as they drive the carpool or <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/best-electric-scooters\">commute</a> to work. You can easily strap the Cubii Cushii onto any car seat, whether you're driving or just a passenger.&nbsp;</p><p>The Cubii weighs just 22 ounces, so it's easy to take it with you anywhere and move it from seat to seat. It's designed to work on airplane seats, train seats, and can even be adjusted to fit wheelchairs.

alt=\"Two Black women (Andy Allo and Zainab Johnson) carry two iPads around their necks, showing the faces of two men.\"><p>When the first season of <i>Upload</i> premiered on Amazon Prime in 2020, creator Greg Daniels and some of his cast members <u><a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/upload-greg-daniels-interview-amazon-prime\">told Mashable he had an uncanny gift for accidental prediction</a></u>. Elements of the show, set in a 2033 where humans' digital selves can be uploaded to a virtual reality afterlife, kept popping up in real life during filming &mdash; like a joke about hospitals having \"vape lung\" units that was written before <u><a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/quit-vaping\">the phenomenon made real-life headlines</a></u>.</p><p>The idea of being able to whisk ourselves into a digital world where our every whim can be coded or gestured into being, and our vulnerable human bodies left behind in meatspace, has existed <u><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_Who_Awoke\">since at least the 1930s</a></u>. Nearly a century later, we're still years off the staggering computing power that would allow fully immersive VR, let alone transferring fully functioning human consciousness into a server. But between the release of the first season of <i>Upload</i> and the second, which arrives on Amazon Prime today, the world's most powerful tech company announced &mdash; <u><a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/iceland-roasts-mark-zuckerberg-meta-with-icelandverse\">to much derision</a></u> &mdash; a pivot to focus on the future of just such a product.</p><p>Because let's face it: <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/what-is-the-metaverse-explainer\">the Metaverse</a> is a product. For all Mark Zuckerberg's dead-eyed utopian promises, accessing whatever the Metaverse ends up becoming will require expensive equipment, connections, data plans &mdash; and that's all before you get in there and need to spend <u><a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nike-metaverse-rtfkt-nikeland-roblox-nft/\">real-world money on digital sneakers</a></u> or rack up a very macro number of microtransactions to make your experience worthwhile.&nbsp;</p><p>The future of our virtual worlds will be shaped not by what's possible, but what's profitable, and <i>Upload</i> gets that.</p><p>The series has been <u><a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/upload-greg-daniels-interview-amazon-prime\">compared relentlessly to </a></u><u><a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/upload-greg-daniels-interview-amazon-prime\"><i>The Good Place</i></a></u>, that other sprightly and sweet afterlife comedy by Daniels' <i>Parks and Recreation</i> co-creator Mike Schur (the two projects were conceived independently, but <u><a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/upload-greg-daniels-interview-amazon-prime\">Schur's happened to get made first</a></u>).

While those of us with office jobs complained (validly!) about our Zoom fatigue and our shitty sourdough and loneliness, millions of others were forced to keep the world running at enormous personal risk, or left without income or support at all.

Storylines where different characters are called to inhabit others' digital avatars draw some wonderfully funny and affecting performances out of the cast &mdash; Edwards, especially, is given a chance to flex her comedy muscles and flesh out Ingrid's controlling-girlfriend archetype with some real pathos. (Her arc here bears a fair bit of resemblance to that of <i>Jane The Virgin</i>'s Petra Solano, another cartoonish rich-bitch whose scheming conceals an emotionally stunted inner child.) </p><p>And as Nora's pragmatic, permanently exasperated work BFF Aleesha, Zainab Johnson emerges as the season's MVP; whether she's dismissing an annoying intern or developing convincing, charming chemistry with a dead man on an iPad, the show is all the better for having expanded her role. Most crucially, it's at its best when it lets itself get properly weird in the back half of this season.</p><div class=\"eloquent-imagery-image\">\n    <div class=\"flex justify-center\">\n        <img class=\"border border-gray-100 h-full\" src=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/02MjCfddnaOorjVHWNkvGze/images-3.fit_lim.size_2000x.v1646987555.jpg\" alt=\"A woman and a man in practical jackets stand in a garden, looking worried.\" srcset=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/02MjCfddnaOorjVHWNkvGze/images-3.fit_lim.size_800x.v1646987555.jpg 800w,https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/02MjCfddnaOorjVHWNkvGze/images-3.fit_lim.size_1400x.v1646987555.jpg 1400w,https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/02MjCfddnaOorjVHWNkvGze/images-3.fit_lim.size_2000x.v1646987555.jpg 1600w\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1408px) 100vw, 1408px\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1331\">\n\n\n    </div>\n            <div class=\"mt-4 subtitle-2 font-sans text-left\">\n            <span class=\"text-gray-1000 normal-case\"></span>\n            <span class=\"credit text-gray-600 capitalize\">Credit: Amazon Studios</span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>There are sometimes nods to outdated <i>Back To The Future</i>-style predictions &mdash; like an absurd office coffee machine that 3D-prints hot mugs of the brown bean juice, including the mug, all at once &mdash; and a lazy running joke about fast food chains buying up IRL social media platforms. (PaneraTok? OK, fine. KFCTwitter? C'mon.) But where <i>Upload</i>'s cheerful techno-cynicism shines most is in the smaller moments. When Nora arrives at a tech-free \"Ludd\" commune in the forest to hide from the corporate conspirators who had Nathan killed, she marvels at their \"unprinted\" vegetables: \"I had a window box [at home],\" she says ruefully, \"but my Monsanto seeds wouldn't grow without a code.\"</p><p><i>Upload</i> still doesn't feel as urgent or as existential as some of the other shows that explore similar questions: <u><a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/years-and-years-why-you-should-watch\">What's on the other side of death</a></u>? <u><a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/severance-apple-tv-plus-review\">Who owns your </a></u><u><a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/severance-apple-tv-plus-review\"><i>self</i></a></u>, when you outsource or loan it to technology and corporations in small but irreversible ways? <u><a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/years-and-years-why-you-should-watch\">Is technology a net good</a></u> if its benefits will only be available to those privileged enough to afford them? But ultimately, <i>Upload</i> doesn't need to be focused on solving those dilemmas.

Well, that and tooling up with the best gear available.</p><p>Investing in good tools is absolutely essential. The lawn mower is probably the most important purchase a gardener will make, but the strimmer is a close second. Grass strimmers, also known as trimmers, keep your lawn edges, borders, and even the lawn itself tidy by cutting back weeds and long patches of grass. Basically, these products handle everything that your lawn mower can't reach. </p><p>But unless you&rsquo;re a gardening expert, choosing a strimmer can be tricky. Here&rsquo;s some must-know info if you&rsquo;re looking to buy a new strimmer.</p><h2><b>Are there different types of lawn strimmer?</b></h2><p>The main types you&rsquo;ll have to choose from are electric strimmers that plug into the mains, cordless strimmers powered by rechargeable batteries, and petrol strimmers which give you extra power.&nbsp;The best option for you really depends on the size of your garden and its current state.</p><h2><b>Corded vs. cordless strimmers &ndash; which are best?</b></h2><p>It&rsquo;s less a case of which is best and more which type best suits your <a href=\"https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-robot-lawnmowers-uk\">garden and gardening needs</a>. Corded strimmers are generally cheapest and best for casual use, but they&rsquo;re slightly limited by the cord. You&rsquo;ll need easy access to a mains outlet &mdash; and you must check that the cord reaches far enough to cover your lawn.</p><p>Cordless strimmers are built for convenience &mdash; lightweight and easy to handle around the garden. The main drawback is that you have to recharge them after use. Look for a model with battery power to match the size of your garden.&nbsp;</p><h2><b>What are the benefits of a petrol strimmer?</b></h2><p><a href=\"https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-petrol-lawn-mowers-uk\">Petrol-powered</a> strimmers promise powerful strimming. If you have a large garden, or particularly tough grass and weeds to cut through, a petrol strimmer is likely the best option. They&rsquo;re not always the best option for more delicate or detailed jobs, such as edging.</p><h2><b>What is lawn edging?</b></h2><p>Lawn edging is pretty much as it sounds &mdash; the art of keeping your lawn neat, tidy, and even styled. It can be surprisingly hard to do if you don&rsquo;t have the right tools. Some strimmers are built for both regular trimming and edging, or may have a cutting head that converts into an edger.</p><h2><b>What are the most important lawn strimmer features?</b></h2><p>As well as edging, there are other handy features that can elevate a strimmer from good to great. They can include a telescopic shaft, adjustable handle, shoulder strap, and brush cutter for tackling brambles and shrubbery.</p><p>Another feature that can be a deal-breaker for some gardeners is an automatic line extension. The &ldquo;line&rdquo; is the thing that whips around quickly and does the actual business of grass cutting (though some strimmers use a blade). The lines sometimes break, so you need a system to replace the line mid-cut. Strimmers may have an automatic line feed, or can extend the line by you pressing a button &mdash; or even by giving the head a bump on the ground.</p><h2><b>What is the best lawn strimmer?</b></h2><p>There are plenty of impressive models out there from top brands like Bosch and Flymo. To help you find the right strimmer for you and your garden, we have lined up a selection of the very best models. We have considered customer reviews, specifications, and features to give you a clear idea of what's out there.</p><p>These are the best strimmers in 2022.</p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 10 Mar 2022 10:12:08 +0000","feedId":91,"bgimg":"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/roundups/03B3P1HGivoIiv5ebmt4NWk/hero-image.png","linkMd5":"f0345b9b528b7361eae7aea996c0f5fc","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn3@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-27-04-603_e7c1227e87ede1b8.webp","destWidth":6000,"destHeight":3375,"sourceBytes":44168699,"destBytes":739108,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/roundups/03B3P1HGivoIiv5ebmt4NWk/hero-image.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn3@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-27-04-603_e7c1227e87ede1b8.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647246421779},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:27:01","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:27:01","title":"I saw my family in the women of ‘Turning Red’","link":"https://mashable.com/article/turning-red-disney-pixar-thanks-i-love-it","description":"<img src=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/03RcIwiXMzwSrs9pjG2h6Z9/hero-image.jpg\" alt=\"Animated still of a mother and daughter looking at a notebook in \" turning red.><p>I knew that <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/turning-red-review\">Disney&rsquo;s </a><a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/turning-red-review\"><i>Turning Red </i></a><a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/turning-red-review\">is about teen angst in 2002,</a><i> </i>but I did not expect to relate to it as deeply as I did.</p><p><i>Turning Red</i> follows 13-year-old Chinese-Canadian, Meilin Lee (Rosalie Chiang) as she grapples with her changing body &mdash; not in the usual ways, but in the form of the giant red panda, which she turns into if she feels any strong emotion. It turns out that the panda problem runs in the family, and that all the women in her family, including Mei&rsquo;s mother (Sandra Oh), have faced it.</p><p>I grew up in an almost overwhelmingly female family (not overwhelming for me, but maybe for the odd boy cousin). My mother has a sister; my grandmother had six. Many of them had daughters, usually in pairs, who went on to have more daughters. When my cousin gave birth to a boy in 2018, the first in 14 years, another cousin told me nervously: &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t <i>have</i> boys!&rdquo;</p><p>Even as an only child living far away from my extended family, I always felt close to them &mdash; just like Mei. When the awkwardness of my teen years set in, any cousin or aunt was a phone call away, and my mother became a trusted confidante &mdash; when most people I knew were running fully in the opposite direction from their parents. I have seen countless shows and movies about teenagers who act out and rebel, but barely any where the kid unironically spends time with her parents or doesn't do anything more scandalous than lie about going to a concert (Mei and I kept things pretty PG, but I think I speak for us both when I say: No regrets).</p><div class=\"eloquent-imagery-image\">\n    <div class=\"flex justify-center\">\n        <img class=\"border border-gray-100 h-full\" src=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/03RcIwiXMzwSrs9pjG2h6Z9/images-1.fit_lim.size_2000x.v1646931119.jpg\" alt='An animated teen girl cringes in a classroom while her mother waves from outside, dodging a security guard; a still from \"Turning Red.\"' srcset=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/03RcIwiXMzwSrs9pjG2h6Z9/images-1.fit_lim.size_800x.v1646931119.jpg 800w,https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/03RcIwiXMzwSrs9pjG2h6Z9/images-1.fit_lim.size_1400x.v1646931119.jpg 1400w,https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/03RcIwiXMzwSrs9pjG2h6Z9/images-1.fit_lim.size_2000x.v1646931119.jpg 1600w\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1408px) 100vw, 1408px\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1161\">\n\n\n    </div>\n            <div class=\"mt-4 subtitle-2 font-sans text-left\">\n            <span class=\"text-gray-1000 normal-case\">My mom picking me up early to get on a plane to India, probably</span>\n            <span class=\"credit text-gray-600 capitalize\">Credit: DIsney</span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>When Meilin's red panda arrives, her mother tells the other women in the family. They share stories of their own pandas and gather to help her expel hers in a ceremony. Mei might want to get out of the house to see her friends and raise money for concert tickets, but she isn't generally averse to her family. The support isn't lost on her, nor is her unique circumstance and having people to share it with. As Mei grows reluctant to part with her panda, she never questions the other women's decision to stifle it, nor questions her place in the family.</p><p>Watching Mei gather with her mother and aunts took me instantly back to every big family gathering over the years &mdash; birthdays, weddings, and Bengali ceremonies where babies eat solid food for the first time. Wherever we meet suddenly echoes with the voices of sisters and cousins talking, laughing, fighting, and ordering each other around. We fall naturally into the roles we held as children or the last time we were in that home, we share stories that span decades and continents. When Mei's family squeeze in around the dining table at her Toronto home, I felt a physical pang for the counterparts in my life, all oceans away until we meet next. </p><q>\n    How incredible that I grew up thousands of miles away from some of the people I love and trust most in the world.\n    </q>\n<p><i>Turning Red</i> masterfully weaves together many threads; early 2000s nostalgia, boy band fever, the unique horror of being a teenage girl, and female familial relationships. I did not expect it to leave me warmly thinking about distant family members and wanting to call my mom (who would call me within hours asking about our Netflix password). The aunties and grandmother aren't central to the film, but they struck a chord that will stay with me for a long time.</p><p>My mom and her cousins grew up in the same city, no one more than an hour away from each other. I sometimes wonder what they were all thinking when they grew up, dreamt big, and scattered across the world. They can&rsquo;t have been thinking about the challenges of raising Indian children in unfamiliar countries, of being custodians of an entire culture, or of a generation of cousins that would sometimes not see each other for years. I say this with admiration, not resentment; for how remarkable is it that Ma&rsquo;s family managed to stay this close despite time and distance? How incredible, that I grew up thousands of miles away from some of the people I love and trust most in the world, and that she made that possible.&nbsp;</p><p>In <i>Turning Red</i>, Mei grapples with growing up and growing away from her family, but she realizes that it&rsquo;s ultimately her own choice. She may spend less time with her mother or share life&rsquo;s daily gossip with her friends, but there are bonds that can&rsquo;t be broken.

I&rsquo;ve spent way more time than I&rsquo;d like to admit at the bottom of a carton of ice cream, sitting on the couch watching <i>Selling Sunset</i>. I wanted to exercise more and eat healthier &mdash; more specifically, I wanted to get a <a href=\"https://mashable.com/roundup/best-blenders-for-smoothies\">blender to make smoothies</a>. But, because I live in a small apartment with an equally small kitchen, I didn&rsquo;t want a big blender that takes up too much of my sacred countertop space.</p><p>My mom (the amazing woman she is) bought me the portable <u><a href=\"https://zdcs.link/w25op\">PopBabies blender</a></u> for Christmas. I&rsquo;ve had it for a few months now and love it. I&rsquo;ve been making myself smoothies every day. And it wasn&rsquo;t that expensive, with prices ranging from $36.99 to $49.99 depending on the color. Plus, you can often find the blender on sale.&nbsp;</p><p>The PopBabies personal blender is ideal for smoothies, protein shakes, baby food, and more. It comes with a base, bottle, screwable top, mini-usb cable for charging, a recipe book, mini ice cube tray, and a funnel.

To see if the blender could really conquer it all, I made smoothies, protein shakes, and smoothie bowls. I found that this blender is maybe the easiest blender I&rsquo;ve ever used and it makes great smoothies for a <a href=\"https://mashable.com/roundup/best-personal-blenders\">single serving</a>. But, it&rsquo;s not very powerful at crushing ice and, while it&rsquo;s easy to drink out of the blender, it&rsquo;s not as great for traveling because of its consistent battery issues. Read on for all the details on the blending process, the included accessories, and more.</p><h2>How does the PopBabies personal blender work?</h2><p>The PopBabies blender is strong enough to crush mini ice cubes and small, frozen fruits. I <i>highly</i> recommend using the small, square-shaped ice cubes from the ice tray accessory included with the blender. The blades are definitely not strong enough to crush normal-sized ice cubes. When I first got this blender, I tried to make a smoothie with the regular ice cubes from my freezer and the results were tragic. The blender&rsquo;s blades could not break the ice cubes no matter how many times I adjusted and restarted or shook the blender. I had to pour everything out and completely start over. The tiny, square ice cubes are the way to go with this blender. And, while it feels ridiculous to say so, the mini ice cubes are a really cute size and perfect for my iced water and juices.</p><div class=\"w-full mx-auto max-w-3xl font-sans mt-8 text-lg leading-loose md:text-xl md:leading-7\">\n        <span class=\"font-bold text-primary-400\">SEE ALSO:</span>\n        <a href=\"https://mashable.com/roundup/best-blenders\" class=\"text-secondary-300\">\n            The best blenders for smoothies, soups, and everything in between\n                            <svg class=\"ml-1 w-4 h-4 fill-current inline-block font-normal\"><use href=\"/images/icons/spritemap.svg#sprite-arrow-right-thin\"></use></svg>\n                    </a>\n    </div>\n<p>For the fruits, veggies, and anything else you want in your smoothie, just make sure they&rsquo;re cut in small enough pieces for the blender to actually slice them. It&rsquo;s best to dice your ingredients. The instructions say not to fill the bottle more than two-thirds full, otherwise you might run into some blending issues. I have often gotten overzealous about what I could fit in the blender and have gone over that limit and had to awkwardly pour out some of my smoothie.</p><p>I find when I&rsquo;m battling a particularly nasty chunk of frozen mango, it&rsquo;s best to stop blending, move stuff around, and then restart because the blades are not the strongest and often get stuck. It also helps to turn it upside down and shake the blender to really get a smooth smoothie. Once you tackle all the tough fruit and ice cubes, it&rsquo;s smoothie sailing (sorry) to blending a great and healthy drink. The PopBabies blender is not horribly loud when it&rsquo;s on, but definitely don&rsquo;t be like me and use it early in the morning with a sleeping roommate in the next room.</p><p>Once it&rsquo;s done, I pop a straw in the 14-ounce cup, detach it from the base, and enjoy my creation. It's nice to not have to transfer the smoothie to a different cup &mdash; I can just drink straight from the blending cup. The blender's compact design at 10 inches tall is great for a small kitchen like mine. When I&rsquo;m done, I put the bottle and top in the dishwasher to clean.</p><div class=\"eloquent-imagery-image\">\n    <div class=\"flex justify-center\">\n        <img class=\"border border-gray-100 h-full\" src=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/reviews/02tD61GRLWBlnXQYgMzn2Yb/images-2.fit_lim.size_2000x.v1646857975.jpg\" alt=\"smoothie blending inside small personal blender\" srcset=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/reviews/02tD61GRLWBlnXQYgMzn2Yb/images-2.fit_lim.size_800x.v1646857975.jpg 800w,https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/reviews/02tD61GRLWBlnXQYgMzn2Yb/images-2.fit_lim.size_1400x.v1646857975.jpg 1400w,https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/reviews/02tD61GRLWBlnXQYgMzn2Yb/images-2.fit_lim.size_2000x.v1646857975.jpg 1600w\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1408px) 100vw, 1408px\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\">\n\n\n    </div>\n            <div class=\"mt-4 subtitle-2 font-sans text-left\">\n            <span class=\"text-gray-1000 normal-case\">As long as you use small ice cubes and small chunks of fruit/veggies, PopBabies blends seamlessly.</span>\n            <span class=\"credit text-gray-600 capitalize\">Credit: Georgia Dodd/Mashable</span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>The PopBabies blender makes great smoothies and power drinks because they are more smooth and liquidy, but, when I tried to make a smoothie bowl, I kept running into issues with the blades. Usually when I make a smoothie bowl on my parents&rsquo; Krups blender, I blend it on low to ensure a super thick smoothie and then, after adding milk, I ramp the speed up to medium and add a protein like peanut butter. But, the PopBabies personal blender only has one level for blending. To make a smoothie bowl &mdash; and not a good one &mdash; with this blender, I had to blend for a really long time. I recommend sticking to smoothies and protein shakes with this blender.</p><p>Compared to a Magic Bullet, the PopBabies portable can't compete. The PopBabies&rsquo; blades are definitely not as strong and the battery life is abysmal after a couple of months.</p><h2>Four hours to charge and it only lasts two blends</h2><p>Though charging (and therefore portability) is a major selling point for this blender, in reality it doesn't work quite as well as I&rsquo;d hoped. The blender comes with a mini-USB charging cable but no outlet block (taking one from Apple&rsquo;s book, I see). While PopBabies claims the battery will last for 20 drinks, it actually lasts between two and five drinks. So, it is portable, but needs to be recharged pretty regularly. The personal blender takes about four hours to fully charge, which can be annoying. But, you do have the option to run it while it charges. To avoid this issue, I constantly keep the PopBabies blender plugged in, which does mean that I don't travel with it.</p><h2>Verdict</h2><p>The PopBabies personal blender is definitely a good mini, portable blender. But, is it worth it?</p><p>I liked that it was easy to use, that it&rsquo;s a great size for a small kitchen, and that it&rsquo;s dishwasher safe. But it has a bad battery life and you have to put in a little more work into making good smoothies than blenders from more recognizable brands like NutriBullet or Vitamix. Overall, this mini but mighty personal blender helps me make great smoothies quickly despite its annoying caveats.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;P.s.
