Your days of <strong>Netflix</strong> free trials are at an end. The streaming giant has officially nixed the option for potential new Netflix subscribers to try out a free trial, and will instead start &#8220;looking at different marketing promotions in the US to attract new members.&#8221; Most streaming services offer a free trial period to lure in users, but it seems Netflix feels they don&#8217;t need that extra bump anymore.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-641243\"></span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21514661/netflix-free-trial-us-cancel-content-sampling-streaming\">The Verge</a> reports that Netflix has confirmed they&#8217;re no longer offering free trials. The Netflix site confirms this as well, providing the <a href=\"https://help.netflix.com/en/node/16282\">following message</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Free trials are not available, but you can still sign up and take advantage of all Netflix has to offer. There are no contracts, no cancellation fees, and no commitments. You have the freedom to change your plan or cancel online at any time if you decide Netflix isn’t for you.</p>\n<p>As a Netflix member, all our plans give you access to our full catalog of TV shows and movies. Choose a plan that works for you and sign up for Netflix!</p></blockquote>\n<p>Instead, the service is trying different things to draw in new users. Netflix has a portal that lets viewers watch a number of their shows for free right now. They also made their original film <em>To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before</em> available to view without a subscription. The other day, we ran a <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/narcos-streaming-free-pluto-tv/\">story</a> that Pluto TV would start running Netflix&#8217;s hit series <em>Narcos</em> for free, with Pluto TV stating: &#8220;Working in partnership with Gaumont, a longtime pioneer in the world of streaming, to bring the acclaimed Netflix Original series Narcos to Pluto TV is further testament to the evolving free streaming landscape that is rapidly gaining foothold for prestige partners, game-changing content and audiences alike.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The idea here seems to be that rather than offer up a free trail to <em>everything</em> on the platform, Netflix is instead dolling out free things in bits and pieces. Netflix is then hoping this will catch the eye of potential customers who will be so enraptured with the free stuff being offered that they&#8217;ll turn around and plop down money to get the rest.</p>\n<p>Will that work? It&#8217;s certainly possible! Other streaming services continue to embrace the free trial offer. Recent services Apple TV+, Disney+, and Quibi all offered free trials during their respective launches, and Apple TV+ just extended theirs to run into early next year. However, Netflix isn&#8217;t a new streaming service – it&#8217;s been around for quite a while, and has already built up a huge name for itself. The reasoning seems to be that they don&#8217;t need to play the same game as newcomers at this point.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/netflix-free-trials/\">Netflix Has Done Away With Free Trials</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=SYGaYdvVyHo:V-QSh6hi3Zg:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=SYGaYdvVyHo:V-QSh6hi3Zg:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=SYGaYdvVyHo:V-QSh6hi3Zg:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=SYGaYdvVyHo:V-QSh6hi3Zg:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=SYGaYdvVyHo:V-QSh6hi3Zg:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=SYGaYdvVyHo:V-QSh6hi3Zg:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/SYGaYdvVyHo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 14 Oct 2020 00:00:50 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Meghan-and-Harry-Netflix-Deal-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"b2fa2535f64650c843e2e50cc8da5087","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn71@2020_2/2020/10/14/02-06-50-665_a778e1c82ef105f8.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":23821,"destBytes":18644,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Meghan-and-Harry-Netflix-Deal-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn71@2020_2/2020/10/14/02-06-50-665_a778e1c82ef105f8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn43@2020_4/2020/10/14/02-07-19-127_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=SYGaYdvVyHo:V-QSh6hi3Zg:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn8@2020_4/2020/10/14/02-07-19-550_298ad3801dde0a28.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn64@2020_5/2020/10/14/02-07-19-783_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=SYGaYdvVyHo:V-QSh6hi3Zg:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn76@2020_2/2020/10/14/02-07-19-741_df1c09a2efdd4cfe.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/SYGaYdvVyHo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn98@2020_1/2020/10/14/02-07-18-618_58e11ea947fcb482.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602641209831},{"createdTime":"2020-10-14 10:06:49","updatedTime":"2020-10-14 10:06:49","title":"‘Jiu Jitsu’ Trailer: Nicolas Cage Trains a War Hero to Fight an Alien in the Battle for Earth","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=641232","description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Jiu-Jitsu-Trailer.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-641240\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Jiu-Jitsu-Trailer-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"Jiu Jitsu Trailer\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Jiu-Jitsu-Trailer-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Jiu-Jitsu-Trailer-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Jiu-Jitsu-Trailer-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Jiu-Jitsu-Trailer.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Hey, do you want to watch a trailer where <strong>Nicolas Cage</strong> calls an alien &#8220;a poet-warrior in the sci-fi sense&#8221;? Then today is your lucky day, my friends. In <strong><em>Jiu Jitsu</em></strong>, Cage plays an Obi-Wan Kenobi- like figure who has to train a war hero to fight an alien invader named Brax. I promise you I&#8217;m not making any of this up. Watch the <em>Jiu Jitsu</em> trailer below and see for yourself.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-641232\"></span></p>\n<h2><strong>Jiu Jitsu Trailer</strong></h2>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/YhIxOqv5Cs0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>In <em>Jiu Jitsu</em>, &#8220;Every six years an ancient order of expert Jiu Jitsu fighters faces a fearsome alien invader in a battle for Earth. For thousands of years, the fighters that protect Earth have played by the rules&#8230;until now. When Jake Barnes, a celebrated war hero and master Jiu Jitsu fighter, refuses to face Brax, the indomitable leader of the invaders, the future of humanity hangs in the balance. Injured and suffering from severe amnesia, Jake is captured by a military squad unequipped to fight the merciless intruder who have descended upon the planet. After a brutal alien attack on the military squad, Jake is rescued by Wylie (Nicolas Cage), and a team of fellow Jiu Jitsu fighters who must help him recover his memory and regain his strength in order to band together and defeat Brax in an epic battle that will once again determine the fate of mankind.&#8221;</p>\n<p>A couple of things: one, this looks amazing, in a dumb sort of way. Two: I love how the alien is just a low-rent <em>Predator</em> knock-off. And three: I&#8217;m positive that this trailer uses every single Nicolas Cage scene from the movie. Cage obviously isn&#8217;t the main character, but he&#8217;s all over this trailer, practically narrating it. And that&#8217;s fine! I love it! I just won&#8217;t be surprised if he ends up being in the movie for five minutes, tops. But based on this trailer, Cage is going to milk every scene he has for what it&#8217;s worth. And honestly, that&#8217;s why you hire a guy like Nic Cage for your movie.</p>\n<p>In addition to Cage, <em>Jiu Jitsu</em> also features <strong>A</strong><b>lain Moussi</b> (<i>Kickboxer: Retaliation</i>, <i>Kickboxer: Vengeance</i>),<b> Frank Grillo </b>(<i>The Purge: Election Year, Captain America: Civil War</i>), <b>Rick Yune </b>(<i>Alita: Battle Angel, Olympus Has Fallen</i>), <b>Marie Avgeropoulos </b>(“The 100,” <i>50/50</i>)<b>, Juju Chan </b>(“Wu Assassins,” <i>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon: Sword of Destiny)</i>, <b>Tony Jaa </b>(<i>Ong-Bak</i> franchise, <i>Furious 7</i>). <b>Dimitri Logothetis </b>(<i>Kickboxer: Retaliation</i>, <i>Kickboxer: Vengeance) </i>directs<i>.</i></p>\n<p><em>Jiu Jitsu</em> kicks its way into theaters, on-demand, and digital on <strong>November 20, 2020</strong>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/jiu-jitsu-trailer/\">&#8216;Jiu Jitsu&#8217; Trailer: Nicolas Cage Trains a War Hero to Fight an Alien in the Battle for Earth</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=msTPsVQ6u_Q:enTOmmFTdYU:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=msTPsVQ6u_Q:enTOmmFTdYU:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=msTPsVQ6u_Q:enTOmmFTdYU:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=msTPsVQ6u_Q:enTOmmFTdYU:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=msTPsVQ6u_Q:enTOmmFTdYU:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=msTPsVQ6u_Q:enTOmmFTdYU:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/msTPsVQ6u_Q\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 13 Oct 2020 23:30:48 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Jiu-Jitsu-Trailer-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"f96d880e032396dedfa0cafab64b04ca","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn44@2020_5/2020/10/14/02-07-08-754_1d8cf5583cb24b91.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":26181,"destBytes":12494,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Jiu-Jitsu-Trailer-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn44@2020_5/2020/10/14/02-07-08-754_1d8cf5583cb24b91.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn43@2020_4/2020/10/14/02-07-19-127_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=msTPsVQ6u_Q:enTOmmFTdYU:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn95@2020_5/2020/10/14/02-07-18-473_222377ca797735b5.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn64@2020_5/2020/10/14/02-07-19-783_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=msTPsVQ6u_Q:enTOmmFTdYU:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn91@2020_5/2020/10/14/02-07-19-501_ef2206a6c7ce4167.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/msTPsVQ6u_Q":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn79@2020_4/2020/10/14/02-07-19-549_edef522c3a59c942.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602641209828},{"createdTime":"2020-10-14 10:06:49","updatedTime":"2020-10-14 10:06:49","title":"‘Furiosa’ Movie Coming From George Miller, With Anya Taylor-Joy, Chris Hemsworth, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II Starring","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=641188","description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/furiosa-movie-cast.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-641196\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/furiosa-movie-cast-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"furiosa movie cast\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/furiosa-movie-cast-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/furiosa-movie-cast-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/furiosa-movie-cast-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/furiosa-movie-cast.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Fans have been hoping for a follow-up to <strong><em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em></strong> ever since<strong> George Miller</strong>&#8216;s 2015 flick left all our jaws on the floor. Finally, it&#8217;s happening.<strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>Furiosa</em></strong>, a prequel film focusing on the character made so iconic by <strong>Charlize Theron</strong> in <em>Fury Road</em>, will star <strong>Anya Taylor-Joy</strong> as the young Furiosa, leading a cast that also includes<strong> Chris Hemsworth</strong> and <strong>Yahya Abdul-Mateen II</strong>. Miller will direct, co-write, and produce.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-641188\"></span></p>\n<p>Multiple outlets are reporting the news that the <em>Furiosa</em> movie is happening, with Anya Taylor-Joy stepping into the role of the title character. Plot details are shrouded in secrecy for the moment, and we have no idea what characters Chris Hemsworth or Yahya Abdul-Mateen II will play. All we know for now is that the film will show the &#8220;genesis&#8221; of the Furiosa character. All I&#8217;ll say is that I <em>really</em> hope Hemsworth is playing young, hot Immortan Joe.</p>\n<p>The <em>Furiosa</em> news is both exciting and bittersweet. The prospect of George Miller returning to this world is incredibly thrilling, as is the cast he&#8217;s lined-up so far – Taylor-Joy, Hemsworth, and Abdul-Mateen II are all performers at the top of their game. However, I can&#8217;t help but feel a little sad that Charlize Theron isn&#8217;t returning. I get that this is a prequel showing Furiosa&#8217;s early days, but part of what made the character so amazing in <em>Fury Road</em> was Theron&#8217;s performance. Even Theron herself expressed displeasure with the turn of the events, <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/furiosa-movie/\">saying</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a tough one to swallow. Listen, I fully respect George, if not more so in the aftermath of making <em>Fury Road</em> with him. He&#8217;s a master, and I wish him nothing but the best. Yeah, it&#8217;s a little heartbreaking, for sure. I really love that character [Furiosa], and I&#8217;m so grateful that I had a small part in creating her. She will forever be someone I think of and reflect on fondly. Obviously, I would love to see that story continue, and if he feels like he has to go about it this way, then I trust him in that manner.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>All that said, I look forward to seeing what Taylor-Joy brings to the part, and I <em>really</em> look forward to seeing whatever crazy, death-defying action set-pieces Miller has up his sleeve. Miller will direct, produce, and co-write, with Nico Lathouris also handling writing duties. Deadline adds that production designer Colin Gibson, editor Margaret Sixel, sound mixer Ben Osmo, and makeup designer Lesley Vanderwalt, all of whom worked on <em>Fury Road</em>, are coming back as well, along with as first assistant director PJ Voeten and second unit director and stunt coordinator Guy Norris.

And those involved in the making of the film have uniquely close ties to the subject of the story, a teenage boy stricken with cancer who turned his terminal illness into a way to provide inspiration to others through song. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clouds</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is nice and well-meaning, but also very much like its title, wispy and transparent and easy to look past.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"more-641133\"></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fin Argus plays Zach Sobiech, a high-school senior in Minnesota in 2012 trying to make the best of his days in school with the reality that he’s diagnosed with osteosarcoma, a bone cancer that’s slowly but surely ravaging his body. Zach is taking the reality of his shortened life in as good a stride as possible, finding joy in performing music with his best friend Sammy (Sabrina Carpenter) and hoping to go to prom at the end of the year. As the school year progresses and Zach’s time becomes more finite, he winds up an unexpected YouTube sensation when his song “Clouds” becomes a viral hit.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Justin Baldoni (who some of you, including this reviewer, may know almost entirely from his role on the CW show </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jane the Virgin</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">) is no stranger to the material in two very different ways. Last year, he made his feature directing debut with </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Five Feet Apart</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a romantic drama in which two teenagers stricken with cystic fibrosis fall in love with each other, even as they’re instructed for medical and safety reasons to stay six feet apart at all times. (Talk about a film with an unexpectedly relevant logline.) But the wrinkle with </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clouds</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is that Baldoni is no stranger to Sobiech’s story, having directed a documentary about the young man before his death in 2013. Behind-the-scenes footage of the documentary shows up during the end credits, allowing us to both see the real Zach and the effect he had on so many people.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All of this means that </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clouds</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is an inherently respectful film, one that’s both low-key and unchallenging. (It is perhaps noteworthy that the book on which the film is based, written by Zach’s mother, name-checks God and faith in its subtitle. That subtitle is omitted from the end credits, and the film isn’t explicitly faith-based.) Like </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Five Feet Apart</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, there’s a romance at the core of the drama, with Argus and Madison Iseman doing a fine job of portraying two sweet high-school kids in an impossible situation. Where </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clouds</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> fails to truly lift off is in those key performances. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Five Feet Apart</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> had the benefit of Haley Lu Richardson as its exemplary lead performer; she all but forced the film to transcend its weepie foundations into a story whose emotions were vastly more earned.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s not that the performances from Argus, Carpenter, or Iseman are bad. The problem is that neither they nor the script are able to elevate beyond being a straightforward tearjerker in the vein of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A Walk to Remember</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The way that music plays a major role allows this movie to feel slightly more distinctive, but Zach’s transition into being a musical sensation &#8212; we see some archival footage, in which journalists like Katie Couric talked about the fast-paced popularity of his song “Clouds” &#8212; only occurs in the final third of the 121-minute movie. The main adult actors, including Lil Rel Howery as a kind teacher, and Neve Campbell and Tom Everett Scott as Zach’s parents, acquit themselves as well as the kids do, but the story never feels quite as special or profound on this side of the screen as it may have to those who brought this story to life. (Fans of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That Thing You Do!</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the 1996 film that served as Scott’s breakout role, will appreciate that there’s a scene in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clouds</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that recalls the earlier film when our characters leap in delight when they hear their big song play on the radio for the first time.)</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clouds</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is&#8230;fine. Baldoni has a solid eye as a director, and only a truly heartless person wouldn’t find something even remotely emotional or sad in the plight of young Zach Sobiech. This is a film with incredibly noble intentions, and there’s nothing exactly </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">wrong</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with it. It’s the kind of film that could easily grab an online audience much as the eponymous song did; </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clouds</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> was supposed to be released through Warner Bros. before they sold it to Disney+ earlier during the pandemic. But while </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clouds</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> absolutely has its heart in the right place, that heart doesn’t translate into a similarly winning story.</span></p>\n<p><strong>/Film Rating: 5 out of 10</strong></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/clouds-review/\">&#8216;Clouds&#8217; Review: A Perfectly Respectful and Perfectly Acceptable Weepie Drama</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=nDzAYQskmPU:pWC34-J2yFk:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=nDzAYQskmPU:pWC34-J2yFk:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=nDzAYQskmPU:pWC34-J2yFk:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=nDzAYQskmPU:pWC34-J2yFk:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=nDzAYQskmPU:pWC34-J2yFk:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=nDzAYQskmPU:pWC34-J2yFk:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/nDzAYQskmPU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 13 Oct 2020 17:00:30 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Clouds-Review-700x301.jpg","linkMd5":"497ca787e8f2990d8d6396d5c4a5e98c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn52@2020_5/2020/10/14/02-07-02-527_9b482a5296346698.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":301,"sourceBytes":31590,"destBytes":20506,"author":"Josh Spiegel","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Clouds-Review-700x301.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn52@2020_5/2020/10/14/02-07-02-527_9b482a5296346698.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn43@2020_4/2020/10/14/02-07-19-127_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=nDzAYQskmPU:pWC34-J2yFk:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn59@2020_2/2020/10/14/02-07-19-519_6dc1b555673c1448.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn64@2020_5/2020/10/14/02-07-19-783_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=nDzAYQskmPU:pWC34-J2yFk:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn20@2020_1/2020/10/14/02-07-18-566_b3093ddee6c4e604.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/nDzAYQskmPU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn41@2020_4/2020/10/14/02-07-18-605_e5473f055c8b9e40.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602641209806},{"createdTime":"2020-10-14 10:06:49","updatedTime":"2020-10-14 10:06:49","title":"‘The Doorman’ Review: Ruby Rose Puts a New Spin on Familiar Action Movie Tropes [Nightstream]","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=641122","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-641129 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/The-Doorman-Review-700x300.jpeg\" alt=\"The Doorman Review\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/The-Doorman-Review.jpeg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/The-Doorman-Review-360x154.jpeg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stop me if you’ve heard this one. A decorated military veteran suffers a traumatizing event in the line of duty and heads to the city to recuperate, only to find more trouble lying in wait. </span><i>Sudden Death</i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span><i>Speed</i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span><i>Skyscraper</i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span><i> Under Siege</i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span><i>The Rock</i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span><i>Passenger 57</i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span><i>White House Down</i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span><i>Con Air</i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span><i>Die Hard</i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Whether it be wreaking havoc on a bus, calculated action within the confines of a small ship or ravaging the top floors of the Nakatomi Plaza, the notion of a highly skilled assassin winding up at the wrong place at the wrong time and having to fight his way out is a narrative that many action movies have come to follow, with little distinction between the masses. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Luckily, </span><b><i>The Doorman</i></b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is here to put a new spin on the old familiar trope by giving audiences what they really want: </span><i>The Midnight Meat Train</i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> director <strong>Ryûhei Kitamura</strong> guiding action star <strong>Ruby Rose</strong> in a bloody battle down to the last man standing.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"more-641122\"></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Starring Rose as former U.S. Marine Ali Gorsky, the film begins with a flashback to the American Embassy in Bucharest, Romania where the Sergeant fails to protect a diplomat and her daughter from international terrorists. While transporting the family through a clearing in the woods, the precious cargo comes under attack from all sides, the cars flipping and burning and popping and exploding like oil in a frying pan. One week later, Gorsky wakes up in New York City, alone, unemployed and irrevocably scarred.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While drowning her sorrows at the local pub with her Uncle Pat (<strong>Philip Whitchurch</strong>), Gorsky keeps insisting that she’s fine, she just needs a job that can help her pay her pills now that the military has quietly cast her aside. Her shell-shocked hallucinations in the cab on the way over suggest different, but as a vet himself, her uncle knows better than to push. Pat brings his niece onboard as the new doorman at The Carrington, a luxurious old five-star hotel undergoing several renovations and mostly empty for Easter weekend. For a fleeting moment, it appears as though she might just be on the path back to normalcy. That is, until <strong>Jean Reno</strong>’s Victor Dubois starts knocking down walls and killing off trespassers while in the midst of hunting down expensive works of art, supposedly hidden somewhere on the property.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While working at the hotel, Gorsky runs into an old flame and his two young children in a romantic subplot that feels completely contrived and unnecessary. In a strange turn of events, this odd little marital affair is shockingly similar to the adultery revealed in </span><i>32 Malasaña Street</i>, another Nightstream title, which not only asks the question of why filmmakers feel it’s so crucial to make their characters cheat, but more importantly, sheds light on the cliché of women sleeping with their best friend’s husbands, or their sister’s husbands, and how tired that trope feels in 2020. Even <i>Palm Springs</i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> offers up the same exact scenario, only with the betrayal happening the night before the wedding as opposed to long after the nuptials are recited. Filmmakers, for the sake of audiences everywhere, please stop making your female leads unfaithful with people in their inner circle. There’s other ways to flesh out women characters, I promise.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A more effective way to explore Gorksy’s psyche and establish her as a tough cookie with inner turmoil is to grapple with the PTSD she is clearly experiencing as a result of her distress in Romania. After losing one child and her mother to the debauchery of war, Gorksy is being saddled with the responsibility of now protecting not just one, but two children while a hail of gunfire rains down on them wherever they go. However, instead of using this through line to better investigate the repercussions of a single soldier carrying the weight of the world on their shoulders, greater attention is paid to Max’s grievances, the little brother played by Julian Feder with whom Gorsky is tasked to guard. Max has always been a bit of a reluctant layabout, running scared at the sight of his own shadow, but with Gorksy’s help, he’s able to overcome his fears and grow as a person. It’s touching, but it would’ve been nice to see the same thought and care put into Gorksy’s character, who remains somewhat static throughout the feature.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An unexpected but welcome addition to this single location thriller is the advent of hidden doors concealed within the walls of the ancient hotel. While Dubois is busy searching for his lost paintings downstairs in the apartment, Max is stealthily leading his sister and Auntie Ali through the undisclosed passageways, pulling old books off of bookcases, opening secret doors and disappearing into the dark. Tunnels left behind by bootleggers and petty thieves, now serving as nifty escape routes that allow the gang to move around the premises without being seen, hiding from the bad guys in plain sight. It’s a charming little detail that helps distinguish this cinematic adventure from the many </span><i>Die Hard</i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> copycats that came before, while simultaneously proving that the trained killer in tow isn’t the only weapon in this crew’s arsenal.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the end of the day, the film’s shortcomings are wholly understandable. With a movie like </span><i>The Doorman</i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, you get what you paid for. This isn’t exactly a multi-layered, intricately navigated slow-burn cerebral thriller. This is a movie you watch at midnight with your friends, the volume at full blast and the spirits flowing freely. Machine guns. Claustrophic fight scenes. Large scale set pieces. Hand to hand combat. Grenade launchers. Heists gone wrong. Pompous pretenders electrocuted on sight. Hardened criminals tapping on the door of secretive steel coated safes. Tiny fighters hurdling over knife wielding giants. Massive explosions. The sheer power of Ruby Rose’s jawline. The greatest mistake the devil ever made was underestimating a woman with a gun, and director Kitamura has come to collect.</span></p>\n<p><strong>/Film Rating: 7 out of 10</strong></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-doorman-review/\">&#8216;The Doorman&#8217; Review: Ruby Rose Puts a New Spin on Familiar Action Movie Tropes [Nightstream]</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=NJccsEcTXvg:GbXeFHmCZeQ:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=NJccsEcTXvg:GbXeFHmCZeQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=NJccsEcTXvg:GbXeFHmCZeQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=NJccsEcTXvg:GbXeFHmCZeQ:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=NJccsEcTXvg:GbXeFHmCZeQ:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=NJccsEcTXvg:GbXeFHmCZeQ:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/NJccsEcTXvg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 13 Oct 2020 16:00:32 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/The-Doorman-Review-700x300.jpeg","linkMd5":"c75081fbb17f985d3f09aca30e28de0a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn39@2020_4/2020/10/14/02-06-53-793_0100198fa2c3a240.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":39898,"destBytes":24998,"author":"Kalyn Corrigan","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/The-Doorman-Review-700x300.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn39@2020_4/2020/10/14/02-06-53-793_0100198fa2c3a240.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn43@2020_4/2020/10/14/02-07-19-127_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=NJccsEcTXvg:GbXeFHmCZeQ:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn40@2020_5/2020/10/14/02-07-19-907_ac2d1c6668cb9e3e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn64@2020_5/2020/10/14/02-07-19-783_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=NJccsEcTXvg:GbXeFHmCZeQ:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn91@2020_6/2020/10/14/02-07-18-264_95b6dc854376aebf.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/NJccsEcTXvg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn44@2020_5/2020/10/14/02-07-19-771_0319b61c7c5a4727.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602641209827},{"createdTime":"2020-10-14 10:06:49","updatedTime":"2020-10-14 10:06:49","title":"‘I’m Your Woman’ Trailer: Rachel Brosnahan is a Mom on the Run","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=641201","description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/im-your-woman-trailer.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-641214\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/im-your-woman-trailer-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"i'm your woman trailer\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/im-your-woman-trailer-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/im-your-woman-trailer-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/im-your-woman-trailer-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/im-your-woman-trailer.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>Rachel Brosnahan</strong> is a mom on the run in <strong><em>I&#8217;m Your Woman</em></strong>. The new Amazon movie from <em>Fast Color</em> director <strong>Julia Hart</strong> has Brosnahan as a woman who hits the road with her young baby because of her husband&#8217;s secret criminal life. The end result looks pretty damn slick, with Brosnahan&#8217;s character slowly learning how to survive her new, unexpected life.

But one thing was clear as I watched: Hart was the real deal, and I couldn&#8217;t wait to see what she did next. And now, here it is – <em>I&#8217;m Your Woman</em>, a new &#8217;70s-set thriller with a well-cut trailer. Here&#8217;s the synopsis:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Set in America in the 1970s, <span class=\"highlight begin\">I’</span><span class=\"highlight end\">m Your</span> Woman revolves around Jean (Rachel Brosnahan) who must go on the run with her child due to her husband’s crimes. Their lives become intertwined with a man (<strong>Arinzé Kene</strong>) and a woman (<strong>Marsha Stephanie Blake</strong>), forming an unlikely partnership that teaches them more than just how to survive</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Bill Heck</strong> and <strong>Frankie Faison</strong> also star, with Hart co-writing with Jordan Horowitz. This is an all-around well-made trailer – it sells its premise without giving too much away. I&#8217;m intrigued! <em>I&#8217;m Your Woman</em>, like <em>Fast Color</em>, is another story of a woman on the run, and speaking with <a href=\"https://ew.com/movies/rachel-brosnahan-im-your-woman-first-look/\">EW</a>, Hart explained what keeps drawing her to this scenario:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s such a powerful metaphor for what it means to be a woman in the world. I just feel like we are constantly on the run, dodging misogyny and trying to push the glass ceiling up. So much of the world is against women or wants women to fail, or doesn&#8217;t want us to succeed or come into our power. I often feel like we&#8217;re constantly on the run and having to rescue ourselves, and give ourselves permission to come into our own powers since the world doesn&#8217;t always seem to want us to.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>The filmmaker also added: &#8220;One of the biggest inspirations for the film was the movie <em>Thief.</em> We actually thank Michael Mann, in the special thanks at the end of the movie, for that. There&#8217;s a line in the movie where Tuesday Weld says, &#8220;I&#8217;m your woman and you&#8217;re my man.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Look, I was already on board for this thing, but throwing out that <em>Thief</em> reference like that just sealed the deal. <em>I&#8217;m Your Woman</em> will open in select theaters on <strong>December 4</strong> ahead of its global launch on Prime Video on <strong>December 11</strong>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/im-your-woman-trailer/\">&#8216;I&#8217;m Your Woman&#8217; Trailer: Rachel Brosnahan is a Mom on the Run</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=xsjnQadHerQ:Uz06fhyMgL8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=xsjnQadHerQ:Uz06fhyMgL8:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=xsjnQadHerQ:Uz06fhyMgL8:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=xsjnQadHerQ:Uz06fhyMgL8:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=xsjnQadHerQ:Uz06fhyMgL8:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=xsjnQadHerQ:Uz06fhyMgL8:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/xsjnQadHerQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 13 Oct 2020 21:30:36 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/im-your-woman-trailer-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"2398a0636f6035c7d6c290050ccbb62d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn67@2020_4/2020/10/14/02-06-50-548_c32e01ced1c35c03.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":31244,"destBytes":19458,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/im-your-woman-trailer-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn67@2020_4/2020/10/14/02-06-50-548_c32e01ced1c35c03.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn43@2020_4/2020/10/14/02-07-19-127_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=xsjnQadHerQ:Uz06fhyMgL8:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn23@2020_5/2020/10/14/02-07-18-616_67cf06de2bdb8c92.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn64@2020_5/2020/10/14/02-07-19-783_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=xsjnQadHerQ:Uz06fhyMgL8:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn54@2020_1/2020/10/14/02-07-18-573_11e6496b975a4dc1.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/xsjnQadHerQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn1@2020_6/2020/10/14/02-07-19-555_61a4a58e570fb287.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602641209807},{"createdTime":"2020-10-14 10:06:49","updatedTime":"2020-10-14 10:06:49","title":"‘Train to Busan’ Follow-Up ‘Peninsula’ is Coming to VOD Just in Time for Halloween","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=641168","description":"<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-641171\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/peninsula-e1602604702213-700x362.jpeg\" alt=\"peninsula vod\" width=\"700\" height=\"362\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/peninsula-e1602604702213-700x362.jpeg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/peninsula-e1602604702213-360x186.jpeg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/peninsula-e1602604702213-768x397.jpeg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/peninsula-e1602604702213.jpeg 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><strong><em>Peninsula</em></strong> is making the stop to VOD much earlier than anticipated. <strong>Yeon Sang-ho</strong>&#8216;s <strong><em>Train to Busan</em></strong> follow-up is set to be available on Digital on <strong>October 27</strong>, just before Halloween.

But, just in time for spooky season, Well Go has set a surprise October video-on-demand release for <em>Peninsula</em>. <a href=\"https://bloody-disgusting.com/movie/3636328/surprise-train-busan-presents-peninsula-coming-digital-just-halloween/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bloody Disgusting</a> reports that <em>Peninsula</em> will be available on Digital in the U.S. on October 27, making the zombie blockbuster the perfect Halloween weekend watch.</p>\n<p>The video on demand release is slated to arrive a month ahead of <em>Peninsula</em>&#8216;s already-announced 4K Ultra HD, Blu-ray, and DVD debut on <strong>November 24</strong>, <strong>2020</strong>. It will also head to streaming soon enough, with Shudder set to debut the film on its horror service in 2021, where it will join all three movies of Yeon&#8217;s loose trilogy, including the animated <em>Seoul Station</em>.</p>\n<p>Though it was considered by many critics to be a disappointing follow-up to the modern zombie classic that is <em>Train to Busan</em>, in <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/peninsula-review/\">my review</a> I called <em>Peninsula</em> &#8220;a loud, over-the-top action flick completely removed from the emotional core that made <em>Train to Busan</em> an unexpected success. But for all its cartoony gore and gaudy imagery, <em>Peninsula</em> does at least fulfill its goal of being <em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em> with zombies.&#8221; While it doesn&#8217;t reach the heights of <em>Train to Busan</em>, or really of the George Miller apocalyptic action movie it&#8217;s trying to emulate, <em>Peninsula</em> is a solidly entertaining zombie flick that doesn&#8217;t take itself too seriously.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the movie&#8217;s official description:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Four years after South Korea’s total decimation in <em>Train to Busan</em>, the zombie thriller that captivated audiences worldwide, acclaimed director Yeon Sang-ho brings us <em>Peninsula</em>, the next nail-biting chapter in his post-apocalyptic world. Jung-seok, a soldier who previously escaped the diseased wasteland, relives the horror when assigned to a covert operation with two simple objectives: retrieve and survive.

In this case, he&#8217;s made Luke Skywalker&#8217;s X-wing the focal point by having the primary image be the spirit of Luke pulling the ship out of the ocean for Rey to use, and the glow-in-the-dark layer acts s a sort of flashback to the moment Yoda pulled Luke&#8217;s ship out of the swamps of Dagobah. It&#8217;s a great juxtaposition of images, and it makes me wish that I liked <em>The Rise of Sky</em>walker a bit more.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-641152 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/starwars-tros-mattferguson-regular-700x467.jpg\" alt=\"Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker - Matt Ferguson\" width=\"700\" height=\"467\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/starwars-tros-mattferguson-regular-700x467.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/starwars-tros-mattferguson-regular-360x240.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/starwars-tros-mattferguson-regular-768x513.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/starwars-tros-mattferguson-regular.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">The Rise of Skywalker by Matt Ferguson<br />\nScreen print<br />\n36 x 24 inches<br />\nHand-numbered edition of 200<br />\n$50<br />\nEstimated to ship in 4 &#8211; 6 weeks</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-641151 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/starwars-tros-mattferguson-variant-700x467.jpg\" alt=\"Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker - Matt Ferguson\" width=\"700\" height=\"467\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/starwars-tros-mattferguson-variant-700x467.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/starwars-tros-mattferguson-variant-360x240.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/starwars-tros-mattferguson-variant-768x513.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/starwars-tros-mattferguson-variant.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">The Rise of Skywalker &#8211; Variant by Matt Ferguson<br />\nScreen print<br />\n36 x 24 inches<br />\nHand-numbered edition of 100<br />\n$60<br />\nEstimated to ship in 4 &#8211; 6 weeks</p>\n<p>Matt Ferguson is back with another quad style poster to finish out the new <em>Star Wars</em> trilogy.

sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>As if 2020 wasn&#8217;t already weird enough, the family comedy <strong><em>The War with Grandpa</em></strong>, starring <strong>Robert De Niro</strong> and directed by <em>Garfield: A Tail of Two Kitties</em> filmmaker <strong>Tim Hill</strong>, has dethroned<strong> Christopher Nolan</strong>&#8216;s sci-fi action blockbuster <strong><em>Tenet</em></strong> from the top spot on the box office charts. All it took was $3.6 million to knock <em>Tenet</em> out of the number one spot, which it held for six weekends in a row. But how did the rest of the weekend fare? Did any other movies from the past return to the charts? Find out below.<span id=\"more-640991\"></span></p>\n<p>While <em>The War with Grandpa</em> came out on top, <em>Tenet</em> stuck around for second place with another $2.1 million added to its haul, making for a total of $48.3 million for its domestic run so far. Meanwhile, the re-release of <strong><em>Hocus Pocus</em></strong> cracked the top three with just $1.1 million, and the rest of the top five was filled out by holdovers <strong><em>The New Mutants</em></strong> and <strong><em>Unhinged</em></strong>, making $685,000 and $660,000 respectively.</p>\n<p>So as you can see, <em>The War with Grandpa</em> benefits from a total lack of competition, resulting in moviegoers seeing the only new movie with recognizable stars in it. Even so, <strong>Laurent Ouaknine</strong>, president, distribution of 101 Studios, appears to be proud of the movie&#8217;s achievement, telling Deadline, &#8220;Really pleased that 101 Studios was able to offer audiences a comedy that is bringing the whole family back to theaters.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Probably not the best time to be proud of that fact, since there&#8217;s still a pandemic that we&#8217;re dealing with. But for some reason, Deadline also uses this as an opportunity to say this:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;A big alert to the major motion picture studios out there: It’s important to note here that of those <em>War With Grandpa</em> moviegoers surveyed, 46% of them had not returned to theaters because there hasn’t been enough movies out there that they wanted to see. If you don’t supply the movies to theaters, audiences won’t come.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Sure, Jan. Except they didn&#8217;t really turn out in droves for a big movie like <em>Tenet</em>. And let&#8217;s not forget that just two days ago, we saw the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/10/health/us-coronavirus-saturday/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">highest number of new coronavirus cases</a> in the United States since August. Plus, 10 states in the Midwest, including Indiana, Minnesota, Missouri and Ohio, reported record one-day rises in cases on Friday. On top of that, Wisconsin and Illinois recently <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-usa-idUSKBN26V0GE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">had a two-day run</a> where they all reported over 3,000 new cases, a trend not seen since the height of the pandemic in the spring. But yes, let&#8217;s encourage studios to put movies in theaters for audiences to rush out to see at a time when we don&#8217;t need to be gathering indoors to see them.</p>\n<p>But <em>The War with Grandpa</em> featured testimonial ads from early screenings talking about how happy they were to be back in theaters and how safe they felt. They were aired all over the biggest network shows throughout the week and all over cable channels too. And yet, all the movie could muster was $3.6 million. Are we really sure that audiences are ready to go back to theaters?</p>\n<p>Head over to <a href=\"https://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/2020W41/?ref_=bo_hm_rw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Box Office Mojo</a> to see how the rest of the box office fared this past weekend, which included the return of <em>Coco</em> to the top 10.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-war-with-grandpa-box-office-defeats-tenet/\">&#8216;The War with Grandpa&#8217; Dethrones &#8216;Tenet&#8217; in the Continually Depressing Weekend Box Office</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=FFGPdUe4gZg:RpN48ZIbAKg:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=FFGPdUe4gZg:RpN48ZIbAKg:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=FFGPdUe4gZg:RpN48ZIbAKg:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=FFGPdUe4gZg:RpN48ZIbAKg:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=FFGPdUe4gZg:RpN48ZIbAKg:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=FFGPdUe4gZg:RpN48ZIbAKg:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/FFGPdUe4gZg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 13 Oct 2020 23:00:00 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/warwithgrandpa-shavingcream-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"49857efa8d7a57471d8c0c0ed8c6bbdd","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn31@2020_3/2020/10/14/02-06-50-471_d05ea29014642f76.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":21464,"destBytes":11646,"author":"Ethan Anderton","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/warwithgrandpa-shavingcream-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn31@2020_3/2020/10/14/02-06-50-471_d05ea29014642f76.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn43@2020_4/2020/10/14/02-07-19-127_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=FFGPdUe4gZg:RpN48ZIbAKg:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn9@2020_4/2020/10/14/02-07-18-280_c8b63e1c1b6ded05.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn64@2020_5/2020/10/14/02-07-19-783_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=FFGPdUe4gZg:RpN48ZIbAKg:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn48@2020_3/2020/10/14/02-07-19-194_812220815f69b134.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/FFGPdUe4gZg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn100@2020_1/2020/10/14/02-07-19-523_8eef4a7f16708224.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602641209814},{"createdTime":"2020-10-14 10:06:49","updatedTime":"2020-10-14 10:06:49","title":"LA Comic-Con Not Happening in December, Will Return in September 2021","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=641178","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-641183 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/lacomiccon-logo-datemarkedout-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"2020 LA Comic-Con Canceled\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/lacomiccon-logo-datemarkedout.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/lacomiccon-logo-datemarkedout-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Not too long ago, Comikaze Entertainment Inc. announced that they were somehow planning on having <strong>LA Comic-Con</strong> happen as an in-person event this December. This was rather shocking to a lot of fans, and had plenty of people questioning the logic behind such a decision considering the precarious times we&#8217;re all living in due to the coronavirus pandemic. Thankfully, they&#8217;ve now canceled their plans for the event to take place later this year, and it will return in the fall of 2021 instead.<span id=\"more-641178\"></span></p>\n<p>The announcement from Comikaze Entertainment Inc. came in an e-mail sent out to convention attendees and a post on the <a href=\"https://www.comicconla.com/new-2021-dates-announced/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">LA Comic-Con website</a>. Here&#8217;s their explanation as to why the event is no longer happening:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Last week on Oct. 7, Gov. Newsom finally gave an update on reopening plans for theme parks, which most people thought would precede event and convention guidelines. In his announcement, the Governor said he had decided NOT to provide reopening guidelines yet for theme parks, and by extension, events. Without guidelines, there is no way for LA County, the City, or event organizers like us to know if the plans and changes we made to be safe will be right, or enough. So with that new direction from the State, we are rescheduling.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The next LA Comic-Con will now happen from <strong>September 24 &#8211; September 26 2021</strong>, which is the usual time that the convention happens each year.</p>\n<p>Honestly, we&#8217;re not sure why they even tried to pull this event off this year, though they did somewhat try to explain their reasoning in the e-mail sent out to attendees. Comikaze Entertainment Inc. wrote:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;We know some of you questioned WHY we were trying to have a show in 2020. It was solely because our fan and exhibitor surveys asked us to try. We made every effort to change our event so it could be both fun and safe, and were awaiting guidelines from the governor to determine if that was possible. Without the guidelines, no one at the LA County Department of Public Health or in the Mayor&#8217;s Office could approve, or reject, our event plans &#8211; we just didn&#8217;t know. Now we know, so we cancelled right away.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>That doesn&#8217;t really explain why they thought you could get it off the ground this year to begin with. There&#8217;s no way an event like this could get the right resources in place to have a safe event during a pandemic. Sure, theme parks have reopened and it&#8217;s possible they can do so with the proper protocols in place, but they have infinitely more money to make it work (and they&#8217;re outdoors). This felt like an ill-advised scenario from the beginning, and we&#8217;re glad that it&#8217;s been pushed back to next year.</p>\n<p>If you paid for tickets, you can either choose to rollover the cost to next year&#8217;s event, or you can have a refund. Comikaze Entertainment Inc. promises to have all refund requests processed within one week. And if you choose the rollover option, you won&#8217;t have to pay a cent more in 2021, even if the prices happen to go up.</p>\n<p>As for the event itself, all the talent that was booked for 2020 will rollover into 2021. Apparently you can even buy tickets and autographs from some of the names right now, and you&#8217;ll be able to redeem them for 2021.</p>\n<p>Head over to the <a href=\"https://www.comicconla.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">LA Comic-Con website</a> for more information, and buy tickets for next year if you&#8217;re so inclined.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/2020-la-comic-con-canceled/\">LA Comic-Con Not Happening in December, Will Return in September 2021</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=SounmOsc3mo:AwFGspB-Jkk:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=SounmOsc3mo:AwFGspB-Jkk:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=SounmOsc3mo:AwFGspB-Jkk:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=SounmOsc3mo:AwFGspB-Jkk:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=SounmOsc3mo:AwFGspB-Jkk:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=SounmOsc3mo:AwFGspB-Jkk:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/SounmOsc3mo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 13 Oct 2020 19:30:44 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/lacomiccon-logo-datemarkedout-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"0a877a6703d34e2e4ea841f0de538808","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn8@2020_4/2020/10/14/02-06-56-142_09bc5ec614a03b50.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":45428,"destBytes":31184,"author":"Ethan Anderton","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/lacomiccon-logo-datemarkedout-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn8@2020_4/2020/10/14/02-06-56-142_09bc5ec614a03b50.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn43@2020_4/2020/10/14/02-07-19-127_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=SounmOsc3mo:AwFGspB-Jkk:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn19@2020_6/2020/10/14/02-07-18-686_d5e3d8d00964533a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn64@2020_5/2020/10/14/02-07-19-783_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=SounmOsc3mo:AwFGspB-Jkk:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn55@2020_5/2020/10/14/02-07-19-397_4edf20135e4057bf.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/SounmOsc3mo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn40@2020_5/2020/10/14/02-07-18-626_dd16f278d0cf1a43.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602641209832},{"createdTime":"2020-10-14 10:06:49","updatedTime":"2020-10-14 10:06:49","title":"‘The Matrix 4’: Lana Wachowski’s Filmmaking Will “Change the Industry Again”","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=641216","description":"<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-608156\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-matrix-4-production-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"the matrix 4 production\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-matrix-4-production-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-matrix-4-production-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-matrix-4-production-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-matrix-4-production.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>In 1999, the Wachowskis changed the face of Hollywood forever with their seminal sci-fi film <strong><em>The Matrix</em></strong> and its sleek vision of a dystopian future and its game-changing &#8220;bullet time&#8221; technology.

Yeah. Lana [Wachowski] is doing some really interesting things on a technical level in the same way that you know, she created a style back then.

That’s probably all I can say for that.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>While it&#8217;s hard to tell what Wachowski is up to with just vague descriptors like &#8220;never-before-seen camera rigs,&#8221; Henwick&#8217;s description matches fellow <em>The Matrix 4</em> actor Neil Patrick Harris&#8217; <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-matrix-4-style-neil-patrick-harris/\">recent statement</a> that the director, who is going solo this time around, has &#8220;shifted visually from what she had done&#8221; stylistically.</p>\n<p>What could it be this time around? It&#8217;s hard to tell whether Wachowski will be inventing a whole new filmmaking technique or whether she&#8217;ll be expanding with new cutting-edge technology like 3D filmmaking, which James Cameron has a pretty tight handle on, or high frame rates like Ang Lee or Peter Jackson have been tinkering with. We do know from Harris that <em>The</em> <em>Matrix 4</em> will be &#8220;ambitious&#8221; and feature plenty of wirework, which was a technology that the first film helped to revolutionize.</p>\n<p><em>The Matrix 4</em> has resumed filming in Berlin with new COVID-19 safety measures in place. Production for <em>The Matrix 4</em> began in San Francisco in February and moved to Berlin in March, but was <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-matrix-4-production-shuts-down/\">forced to halt</a> due to the coronavirus pandemic. <em>The Matrix 4</em> is being directed by Lana Wachowski, who co-wrote the script with David Mitchell and Aleksandar Hemon. Original franchise cast members <strong>Keanu Reeves</strong>, <strong>Carrie-Anne Moss</strong>, and <strong>Jada Pinkett Smith</strong> are all set to return, with new cast members including <strong>Priyanka Chopra</strong>, Jessica Henwick, <strong>Neil Patrick Harris</strong>, <strong>Toby Onwumere</strong>, <strong>Brian J.

White&#8217;s children&#8217;s fantasy story about a young boy who is imprisoned by a witch.

Get more <em>Night Books</em> movie details below.<span id=\"more-641237\"></span></p>\n<p>Deadline reports that a <em>Night Books</em> movie will be the next project for Brightburn director David Yarovesky, whose previous credits also include the 2014 horror film <em>The Hive</em>. The film is based on White&#8217;s 2019 novel Nightbooks (the book title is only one word), which &#8220;follows Alex (Fegley), a boy obsessed with scary stories, who is imprisoned by an evil young witch (Ritter) in her contemporary New York City apartment. He meets Yasmin (Jewett), who is also trapped there, and learns he must tell a new scary story every night in order to stay alive.&#8221;</p>\n<p>There must be something in the air, because this is the second project I&#8217;ve heard about over the past few weeks which involves the idea of characters telling scary stories to each other in high-stakes scenarios. (The other is an indie horror comedy called <em>Scare Me</em>, which is streaming right now on Shudder.)</p>\n<p>Casting Krysten Ritter as an evil witch sounds pretty perfect to me, although since this movie is described as a &#8220;family pic,&#8221; she won&#8217;t be able to get <em>totally</em> unhinged as this character. (Still, maybe this will inspire someone else to cast her as a witch in a project where she can really let loose.) Lidya Jewett played young Nakia in <em>Black Panther</em> and has had roles in <em>Hidden Figures</em>, <em>Good Girls</em>, and <em>Feel the Beat</em>. And look out world, because the Fegley clan is coming in to take over Hollywood. Winslow Fegley, who is playing the lead role in <em>Night Books</em>, is the younger brother of Oakes Fegley, the kid at the center of Disney&#8217;s <em>Pete&#8217;s Dragon</em> remake and who&#8217;s about to go to war with his grandpa in the Robert De Niro comedy <em>The War With Grandpa</em>. It&#8217;s only a matter of time until there&#8217;s a Fegley in every major project coming down the pike, so it&#8217;s probably in your best interest to go ahead and swear your undying fealty to them now.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/night-books-movie/\">&#8216;Night Books&#8217;: A Child Must Tell a Scary Story Every Night to Survive</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=rUKnDQLpulY:mT20wv13VmU:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=rUKnDQLpulY:mT20wv13VmU:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=rUKnDQLpulY:mT20wv13VmU:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=rUKnDQLpulY:mT20wv13VmU:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=rUKnDQLpulY:mT20wv13VmU:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=rUKnDQLpulY:mT20wv13VmU:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/rUKnDQLpulY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 14 Oct 2020 00:30:57 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Night-Books-movie-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"84782a5b9427d42015950f4100fbef24","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn63@2020_2/2020/10/14/02-06-50-598_dd77339286d0e858.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":49082,"destBytes":37694,"author":"Ben Pearson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Night-Books-movie-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn63@2020_2/2020/10/14/02-06-50-598_dd77339286d0e858.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn43@2020_4/2020/10/14/02-07-19-127_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=rUKnDQLpulY:mT20wv13VmU:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn28@2020_2/2020/10/14/02-07-19-569_335a68c5387be264.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn64@2020_5/2020/10/14/02-07-19-783_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=rUKnDQLpulY:mT20wv13VmU:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn28@2020_2/2020/10/14/02-07-18-632_b6bcfd45d92f9de1.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/rUKnDQLpulY":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn68@2020_2/2020/10/14/02-07-19-391_92e943968bd2f94d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602641209829},{"createdTime":"2020-10-14 10:06:49","updatedTime":"2020-10-14 10:06:49","title":"Park Chan-wook’s Next Movie, ‘Decision to Leave,’ Starts Shooting This Month","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=641182","description":"<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-641186\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/park-chan-wook-1-e1602608603327-700x329.jpg\" alt=\"decision to leave filming\" width=\"700\" height=\"329\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/park-chan-wook-1-e1602608603327-700x329.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/park-chan-wook-1-e1602608603327-360x169.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/park-chan-wook-1-e1602608603327-768x361.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/park-chan-wook-1-e1602608603327.jpg 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Park Chan-wook</strong> is getting started on his first feature film in four years.

He begins to suspect the man’s widow (Tang), whom he also develops romantic feelings for.</p></blockquote>\n<p><em>Decision to Leave</em> sounds like a noir in the vein of Alfred Hitchcock, which is intriguing territory for an envelope-pushing director like Park. The film comes four years after Park&#8217;s last feature film <em>The Handmaiden</em>, which made /Film&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/best-movies-of-the-decade-part-one/\">best of the decade list</a>, and two years after he made his foray into English-language TV with the John Le Carré adaptation for AMC/BBC, <em>The Little Drummer Girl, </em>starring Florence Pugh and Alexander Skarsgård.</p>\n<p>Park remains one of the most exciting Korean auteurs, with his brutal, bone-breaking <em>Vengeance Trilogy</em> setting the stage for Korean film to explode on a global scale. With his fellow Korean Wave filmmaker and friend Bong Joon-ho recently taking home a historic Oscar for <em>Parasite</em>, it&#8217;s only a matter of time before Park is back in the awards conversation in the U.S. and becomes the household name he deserves to be, especially after his electrifying erotic drama <em>The Handmaiden</em> was unfairly snubbed by the Academy four years ago.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/park-chan-wook-decision-to-leave-filming/\">Park Chan-wook&#8217;s Next Movie, &#8216;Decision to Leave,&#8217; Starts Shooting This Month</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=Wl2Y2NKHVEk:UCC0x-7Anyw:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=Wl2Y2NKHVEk:UCC0x-7Anyw:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=Wl2Y2NKHVEk:UCC0x-7Anyw:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=Wl2Y2NKHVEk:UCC0x-7Anyw:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=Wl2Y2NKHVEk:UCC0x-7Anyw:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=Wl2Y2NKHVEk:UCC0x-7Anyw:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/Wl2Y2NKHVEk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 13 Oct 2020 19:00:42 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/park-chan-wook-1-e1602608603327-700x329.jpg","linkMd5":"ec7f2e6436a23ba4bac835acb5de2fdc","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn12@2020_4/2020/10/14/02-06-50-513_5d230053853447cc.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":329,"sourceBytes":32405,"destBytes":20598,"author":"Hoai-Tran Bui","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/park-chan-wook-1-e1602608603327-700x329.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn12@2020_4/2020/10/14/02-06-50-513_5d230053853447cc.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn43@2020_4/2020/10/14/02-07-19-127_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=Wl2Y2NKHVEk:UCC0x-7Anyw:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn86@2020_1/2020/10/14/02-07-18-455_b28892919a9667ee.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn64@2020_5/2020/10/14/02-07-19-783_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=Wl2Y2NKHVEk:UCC0x-7Anyw:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn67@2020_3/2020/10/14/02-07-18-599_a0b73f5598b50398.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/Wl2Y2NKHVEk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn52@2020_3/2020/10/14/02-07-19-660_05b390e7ca911f51.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602641209829},{"createdTime":"2020-10-14 10:06:49","updatedTime":"2020-10-14 10:06:49","title":"Superhero Bits: ‘Spider-Man 3’ Rumors, New Set Photos from ‘The Batman’, ‘Blade’ on 4K & More","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=641195","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-641254 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/spiderman-milesmorales-ps5-dailybuglenow-700x325.jpg\" alt=\"Spider-Man: Miles Morales - Daily Bugle Now\" width=\"700\" height=\"325\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/spiderman-milesmorales-ps5-dailybuglenow-700x325.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/spiderman-milesmorales-ps5-dailybuglenow-360x167.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/spiderman-milesmorales-ps5-dailybuglenow-768x356.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/spiderman-milesmorales-ps5-dailybuglenow.jpg 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Who are the latest names rumored to be in <strong><em>Spider-Man 3</em></strong>?

Or, at least, as big of a big shot as a kid detective could be. When he was younger, he set up his own mini-detective agency and solved mini-mysteries, to much acclaim. Now, however, he&#8217;s a bored, sad-sack adult, pining for his days of youthful glory. He&#8217;s still a detective, albeit a less enthusiastic one, working lame, easy-to-solve cases. And then a <em>real</em> mystery falls into his lap. Watch <strong><em>The </em><em>Kid Detective</em></strong> trailer below.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-641173\"></span></p>\n<h2><strong>The Kid Detective Trailer </strong></h2>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KEyiKNXsVGo?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>In <em>Kid Detective</em>, &#8220;A once-celebrated kid detective, now 31, continues to solve the same trivial mysteries between hangovers and bout of self-pity. Until a naïve client brings him his first &#8216;adult&#8217; case – to find out who brutally murdered her boyfriend.&#8221; This sounds somewhat similar to the criminally underseen <em>Mystery Team</em>, albeit with a darker edge.</p>\n<p><strong>Adam Brody</strong> is the former kid detective, and I&#8217;ll confess right now that I&#8217;m not up-to-date on the work of Mr. Adam Brody. I only really know him from a memorable supporting turn in <em>Thank You For Smoking</em>, and, more recently, his scene-stealing work in the excellent <em>Ready or Not</em>. He definitely has that &#8220;I&#8217;m hiding my crushing misery with dry humor&#8221; thing down pat, so this seems like a good role for him.</p>\n<p>In addition to Brody, the <em>Kid Detective</em> cast includes<strong> Sophie Nélisse</strong>, <strong>Tzi Ma</strong>, <strong>Wendy Crewson</strong>, and <strong>Sarah Sutherland</strong>. <strong>Evan Morgan </strong>(<em>The Dirties</em>) writes and directs the pic. Brody told <a href=\"https://ew.com/movies/adam-brody-kid-detective-exclusive-trailer/\">EW</a> that his character in <em>Kid Detective</em> is a &#8220;self-absorbed and somewhat pathetic sleuth.&#8221; He added: &#8220;He&#8217;s obviously stunted. There&#8217;s unexamined trauma there. In detective stories there are archetypes. There&#8217;s the sleuth, the boozy sleuth, the down-on-his-luck sleuth, but then there&#8217;s also [Abe].&#8221;</p>\n<p><em>The Kid Detective </em>played at TIFF this year – sort of. It was part of the Industry Selects titles – movies that <em>would</em> have played at certain venues if TIFF had the festival run normally this year. But the coronavirus caused the fest to be mostly virtual, and I don&#8217;t remember hearing much buzz about this flick while the festival was ongoing. And there are zero reviews of it over at Rotten Tomatoes, even though there are a few reviews of the film floating around the web. Make of that what you will!</p>\n<p><em>The Kid Detective</em> is apparently opening in theaters on<strong> October 16</strong>, <strong>2020 </strong>– which is this Friday. I have a hard time buying that, just as I have a hard time understanding why this small-ish film <em>isn&#8217;t</em> going to VOD at a time like this.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-kid-detective-trailer/\">&#8216;The Kid Detective&#8217; Trailer: Adam Brody is a Grown-Up Child Detective</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=POnAaIU3XQw:coAtXaTy8mM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=POnAaIU3XQw:coAtXaTy8mM:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=POnAaIU3XQw:coAtXaTy8mM:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=POnAaIU3XQw:coAtXaTy8mM:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=POnAaIU3XQw:coAtXaTy8mM:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=POnAaIU3XQw:coAtXaTy8mM:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/POnAaIU3XQw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 13 Oct 2020 22:00:32 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-kid-detective-trailer-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"a8b3305df71b216032edaec90e1a0fc4","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn15@2020_3/2020/10/14/02-06-50-483_13d9a9138442e435.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":32672,"destBytes":19462,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-kid-detective-trailer-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn15@2020_3/2020/10/14/02-06-50-483_13d9a9138442e435.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn43@2020_4/2020/10/14/02-07-19-127_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=POnAaIU3XQw:coAtXaTy8mM:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn32@2020_3/2020/10/14/02-07-18-614_f85f15abf0a28b31.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn64@2020_5/2020/10/14/02-07-19-783_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=POnAaIU3XQw:coAtXaTy8mM:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn3@2020_4/2020/10/14/02-07-18-631_397d4232deabed4f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/POnAaIU3XQw":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn7@2020_5/2020/10/14/02-07-18-570_b629d770f90425cc.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602641209805},{"createdTime":"2020-10-14 10:06:49","updatedTime":"2020-10-14 10:06:49","title":"AMC Theatres May Be Out of Cash By the End of 2020, B&B Theatres Months Away from Bankruptcy","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=641161","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-343590 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/amctheatres-front-700x294.jpg\" alt=\"AMC Theatres Out of Money Soon\" width=\"700\" height=\"294\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/amctheatres-front-700x294.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/amctheatres-front-360x151.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/amctheatres-front.jpg 1300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>With a complete lack of major new releases coming to theaters over the next couple months, and potentially through the rest of the year, the movie theater industry is in trouble. Cineworld just <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/regal-cinemas-closing-starting-on-october-8/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">closed all of their Regal Cinemas locations</a> in the United States (with the exception of a handful of key locations in California) last week because of how many blockbusters shifted to 2021, but <strong>AMC Theatres</strong>, along with Cinemark, pledged to stay open, but it doesn&#8217;t mean they&#8217;re in a good position at all.</p>\n<p>AMC Theatres has revealed that if things don&#8217;t improve in the near future, they might be out of cash by the end of 2020 or sometime in early 2021. They&#8217;re not the only ones in imminent danger either, because <strong>B&#38;B Theatres</strong>, the sixth largest cinema chain in the U.S., has announced that they&#8217;re months away from filing for bankruptcy protection if nothing changes. Needless to say, this is bad news.<span id=\"more-641161\"></span></p>\n<p>Deadline has the latest troubling update on the state of AMC Theatres. The company&#8217;s SEC filing explains the precarious situation that they find themselves in. The company states:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Given the reduced movie slate for the fourth quarter, in the absence of significant increases in attendance from current levels or incremental sources of liquidity, at the existing cash burn rate, the Company anticipates that existing cash resources would be largely depleted by the end of 2020 or early 2021.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>AMC Theatres isn&#8217;t going through cash any faster than they anticipated, but they&#8217;re not bringing in as much money as they were hoping for when movie theaters reopened. That&#8217;s due to both decreased attendance from audiences and a lack of new movies to draw them back in. One might say that the latter caused the former, but the release of Christopher Nolan&#8217;s <em>Tenet</em> seems to have proved otherwise. Though one does wonder if a movie like <em>Black Widow</em> or <em>Wonder Woman 1984</em> might have fared better.</p>\n<p>AMC Theatres notes that they &#8220;will require additional sources of liquidity or increases in attendance levels&#8221; in order to avoid running out of cash sooner than later. The company notes that their survival is dependent on a variety of other factors including &#8220;the timing of resumption of theatre operations, including with respect to some of our most productive theatres which remain closed, the timing of movie releases and the slate of future releases, theatre attendance levels, landlord negotiations and minimum lease payments, costs associated with the AMC Safe and Clean initiative, and food and beverage receipts.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Over the summer, AMC Theatres had some major debt restructuring, and they brought in several hundred million dollars in cash along with negotiating reduced interest payments and extended maturities on loans. But since the situation with the coronavirus pandemic hasn&#8217;t improved much, neither has the resurgence of movie theaters. So now they&#8217;re looking at more debt and equity financing to stay afloat, and they&#8217;ll go back to the table with landlords to figure out what can be done about their lease payments. Apparently, they&#8217;re even considering striking arrangements with existing business partners and possibly even becoming a joint-venture by bringing in another company to help them out.</p>\n<p>Even though a lot of moviegoers are still leery about returning to theaters in general, AMC Theatres recently decided to follow in <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/cinemark-theatre-rental/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the footsteps of Cinemark</a> by offering private theater rental for a bargain price. AMC will now let you watch recent theatrical releases and older favorite with your own private group of friends, <a href=\"https://www.amctheatres.com/rentals\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">starting at $99</a>.</p>\n<p>But even so, AMC Theatres is essentially on life support, and they&#8217;re hoping for a miracle. And they&#8217;re not the only ones.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-641174 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/bbtheatres-webpage-logo-700x314.jpg\" alt=\"B&#38;B Theatres\" width=\"700\" height=\"314\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/bbtheatres-webpage-logo-700x314.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/bbtheatres-webpage-logo-360x162.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/bbtheatres-webpage-logo-768x345.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/bbtheatres-webpage-logo.jpg 1226w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/09/movie-theater-operator-bb-theatres-says-its-months-from-bankruptcy.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CNBC</a> has learned that B&#38;B Theatres, the sixth-largest movie theater chain in the United States, may be forced to file for bankruptcy if the current environment doesn&#8217;t improve. This is a company that&#8217;s been operating for nearly 100 years, and the coronavirus pandemic is on the verge of shutting them down.</p>\n<p>B&#38;B Theatres has 48 movie theaters in eight states, and they&#8217;ve been unable to pay full rent for them. Plus, after a majority of their locations were closed from March through August, they had to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to repair projectors after they were unused for that entire time. Brock Bagby, an executive vice president at B&#38;B Theatres and part of the fourth generation of his family to operate the theater, said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;We are probably a few months out if nothing changes. If we run the course that we are running now, we are probably a few months out. It’s bad.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>This is a family business. Bob Bagby is the CEO, and his siblings Bobbie Bagby Ford and Brittanie Bagby Baker also have executive vice president roles alongside his son Brock. So you can see where the B&#38;B name comes from.</p>\n<p>B&#38;B Theatres has been working with the National Association of Theatre Owners to plead their case to the government in order to receive some level of financial assistance in order to survive this economic downturn brought on by the coronavirus pandemic. But NATO sounds desperate too. Esther Baruh, director of government relations for NATO, said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;The stark reality is that many movie theaters will not be able to open again if they don’t receive government help. This is as urgent as it gets. The exhibition industry thrived before this pandemic and it will thrive again, but theaters and their employees need a bridge to get them to that point.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>If things don&#8217;t improve, NATO estimates that 69% of small and mid-sized cinema companies would be forced to file for bankruptcy or close permanently. And that will be a crushing blow to the movie theater industry, and it could end up hurting studios too, giving them fewer theaters for their movies to play in. Sure, movie studios could buy some of those movie theaters, but we&#8217;ve already talked about <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/paramount-consent-decrees/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">why that&#8217;s not a best-case scenario</a>. That&#8217;s why some of the biggest filmmakers in the business are also <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/hollywood-filmmakers-ask-congress-to-save-movie-theaters/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">pleading to the government for help</a>.</p>\n<p>A big part of the blame for the lack of a bigger box office is the fact that New York and California haven&#8217;t allowed most movie theaters to open yet. With New York City and Los Angeles driving box office in those states, they make up 21.5% of the total box office in the United States. But even when you take that into account, the rest of the country&#8217;s box office still isn&#8217;t doing nearly as well as it needs to be in order to save movie theaters.</p>\n<p>This sounds like the beginning of the end for the movie theater industry as we know it. Though movie theaters won&#8217;t disappear completely, this will cripple them for a long time unless something changes soon.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/amc-theatres-out-of-money-bb-theatres-may-go-bankrupt/\">AMC Theatres May Be Out of Cash By the End of 2020, B&#038;B Theatres Months Away from Bankruptcy</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=iRZwa1CY4IM:1-8976P0FFY:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=iRZwa1CY4IM:1-8976P0FFY:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=iRZwa1CY4IM:1-8976P0FFY:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=iRZwa1CY4IM:1-8976P0FFY:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=iRZwa1CY4IM:1-8976P0FFY:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=iRZwa1CY4IM:1-8976P0FFY:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/iRZwa1CY4IM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 13 Oct 2020 18:30:59 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/amctheatres-front-700x294.jpg","linkMd5":"e855991ce5ea059222cf3b5b5a28a87d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn60@2020_3/2020/10/14/02-06-50-410_76ee736aac2cf2b3.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":294,"sourceBytes":68918,"destBytes":37214,"author":"Ethan Anderton","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/amctheatres-front-700x294.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn60@2020_3/2020/10/14/02-06-50-410_76ee736aac2cf2b3.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/bbtheatres-webpage-logo-700x314.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn48@2020_6/2020/10/14/02-07-19-184_fa2b45ab23e75015.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn43@2020_4/2020/10/14/02-07-19-127_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=iRZwa1CY4IM:1-8976P0FFY:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn48@2020_1/2020/10/14/02-07-19-711_16f22c58ae515fcc.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn64@2020_5/2020/10/14/02-07-19-783_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=iRZwa1CY4IM:1-8976P0FFY:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn52@2020_3/2020/10/14/02-07-19-192_ac7406c5001a2777.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/iRZwa1CY4IM":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn31@2020_4/2020/10/14/02-07-19-599_4e18b2e2aaa8ef54.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602641209806},{"createdTime":"2020-10-14 10:06:49","updatedTime":"2020-10-14 10:06:49","title":"‘Nine Days’ Trailer: Winston Duke Guides Lost Souls in Sundance Award-Winning Existential Drama","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=641131","description":"<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-641165\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/nine-days-700x292.jpg\" alt=\"nine days trailer\" width=\"700\" height=\"292\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/nine-days-700x292.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/nine-days-360x150.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/nine-days-768x321.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/nine-days.jpg 1440w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>What if Pixar&#8217;s <em>Soul </em>was an existential arthouse drama?

Soon, several candidates — unborn souls — arrive at Will’s to undergo tests determining their fitness, facing oblivion when they are deemed unsuitable. But Will soon faces his own existential challenge in the form of free-spirited Emma (Zazie Beetz), a candidate who is not like the others, forcing him to turn within and reckon with his own tumultuous past. Fueled by unexpected power, he discovers a bold new path forward in his own life. Making his feature-film debut after a series of highly acclaimed and award-winning short films and music videos, Japanese Brazilian director Edson Oda delivers a heartfelt and meditative vision of human souls in limbo, aching to be born against unimaginable odds, yet hindered by forces beyond their will…</p></blockquote>\n<p>Sony Pictures Classics is set to release <em>Nine Days</em> sometime in 2021.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/nine-days-trailer/\">&#8216;Nine Days&#8217; Trailer: Winston Duke Guides Lost Souls in Sundance Award-Winning Existential Drama</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=szxyPZ1H0Vc:tzyx8L0nowk:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=szxyPZ1H0Vc:tzyx8L0nowk:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=szxyPZ1H0Vc:tzyx8L0nowk:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=szxyPZ1H0Vc:tzyx8L0nowk:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=szxyPZ1H0Vc:tzyx8L0nowk:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=szxyPZ1H0Vc:tzyx8L0nowk:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/szxyPZ1H0Vc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 13 Oct 2020 16:30:53 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/nine-days-700x292.jpg","linkMd5":"27b378fb5a46391d3f52a918ea997485","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn35@2020_4/2020/10/14/02-07-10-814_0087678950a3b19c.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":292,"sourceBytes":11692,"destBytes":5078,"author":"Hoai-Tran Bui","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/nine-days-700x292.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn35@2020_4/2020/10/14/02-07-10-814_0087678950a3b19c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn43@2020_4/2020/10/14/02-07-19-127_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=szxyPZ1H0Vc:tzyx8L0nowk:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn11@2020_3/2020/10/14/02-07-18-806_1122bfacc88c6e2f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn64@2020_5/2020/10/14/02-07-19-783_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=szxyPZ1H0Vc:tzyx8L0nowk:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn65@2020_4/2020/10/14/02-07-18-639_76b07b8bb6c9330b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/szxyPZ1H0Vc":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn84@2020_1/2020/10/14/02-07-19-442_b9a0ea37ca3a182d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602641209834},{"createdTime":"2020-10-14 10:06:49","updatedTime":"2020-10-14 10:06:49","title":"‘Star Trek’ Shows Are Planned Out Through 2027, Alex Kurtzman Says","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=641218","description":"<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-549460 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Star-Trek-Discovery-Such-Sweet-Sorrow-Review-700x300.png\" alt=\"Star Trek plan\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Star-Trek-Discovery-Such-Sweet-Sorrow-Review.png 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Star-Trek-Discovery-Such-Sweet-Sorrow-Review-360x154.png 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Alex Kurtzman</strong>, one of the architects and overseers of modern <em><strong>Star Trek</strong></em>, has a plan. He actually has several plans, all spinning at once like Earl Grey teacup saucers balancing on the ends of multiple sticks. Such is the case when you hold the future of a massive piece of intellectual property in the palm of your hand – but fans can rest easy, because <em>Trek</em> isn&#8217;t going anywhere any time soon. In a new interview, Kurtzman says he has mapped things out for the CBS All Access TV shows all the way through <strong>2027</strong>.<span id=\"more-641218\"></span></p>\n<p>Speaking on The Hollywood Reporter&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/tvs-top-5-inside-the-state-of-star-trek-with-franchise-captain-alex-kurtzman\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">TV Top 5 podcast</a> (via <a href=\"https://comicbook.com/startrek/news/star-trek-new-series-expansion-2027/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ComicBook.com)</a>, Kurtzman explained that he and his team have a plan for the <em>Star Trek</em> universe which lasts at least through the next seven years.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;<strong>Heather Kaden</strong> and <strong>Aaron Baiers</strong>, who work with me at [production company] Secret Hideout — we literally just got off a call with the network mapping out with us through 2027. Now when I say that, it&#8217;s not like it&#8217;s set in stone. It&#8217;s just, &#8216;Here&#8217;s a plan. Here&#8217;s what we&#8217;re looking at. Here&#8217;s how the different shows are going to drop.&#8217; Consider the fact that it takes a year from inception — from starting production — to airing, you have to plan way, way, way in advance to get these things done, and you have to stay on top of the zeitgeists and make sure that what you&#8217;re doing is relevant. So you have to plan so far in advance now in different kinds of ways [like safety and budget] to seem loose and improvisational, but there&#8217;s nothing loose and improvisational about it.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>There has only been one lengthy, significant dark period in <em>Star Trek</em> franchise history, when no TV shows or movies were being created. That lasted from 2005-2009, after the conclusion of <em>Star Trek: Enterprise</em> to when J.J. Abrams&#8217; first movie gave the franchise a jolt in the arm and helped usher in a new generation of fans. But Trekkies – er, Trekkers – can take a deep breath, because there&#8217;s no danger in the franchise running into another dark period any time soon. With a total of six shows either already on the air or announced, this is by far the busiest the <em>Trek</em> franchise has ever been and the busiest it&#8217;s been since the early 1990s, when <em>Deep Space Nine</em> was ramping up, the <em>Next Generation</em> was on, and the original series crew movies were coming to an end.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/star-trek-plan-2027/\">&#8216;Star Trek&#8217; Shows Are Planned Out Through 2027, Alex Kurtzman Says</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=5_RHgq3N1NM:z73tJ9dEOyg:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=5_RHgq3N1NM:z73tJ9dEOyg:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=5_RHgq3N1NM:z73tJ9dEOyg:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=5_RHgq3N1NM:z73tJ9dEOyg:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=5_RHgq3N1NM:z73tJ9dEOyg:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=5_RHgq3N1NM:z73tJ9dEOyg:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/5_RHgq3N1NM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 13 Oct 2020 20:00:57 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Star-Trek-Discovery-Such-Sweet-Sorrow-Review-700x300.png","linkMd5":"c58cee186eca23e1e7aaef9a669a4c08","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn28@2020_4/2020/10/14/02-07-16-941_f97dd2c7e0f42826.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":391456,"destBytes":28898,"author":"Ben Pearson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Star-Trek-Discovery-Such-Sweet-Sorrow-Review-700x300.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn28@2020_4/2020/10/14/02-07-16-941_f97dd2c7e0f42826.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn43@2020_4/2020/10/14/02-07-19-127_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=5_RHgq3N1NM:z73tJ9dEOyg:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn99@2020_2/2020/10/14/02-07-18-288_42c267b9d910b83c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn64@2020_5/2020/10/14/02-07-19-783_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=5_RHgq3N1NM:z73tJ9dEOyg:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn16@2020_5/2020/10/14/02-07-18-774_683a83c00edd4e6e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/5_RHgq3N1NM":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn95@2020_4/2020/10/14/02-07-19-465_68c132f41ddd6350.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602641209831},{"createdTime":"2020-10-14 10:06:49","updatedTime":"2020-10-14 10:06:49","title":"Horror-Comedy ‘Bad Hair’ Headed to Drive-Ins This Month","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=641217","description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/bad-hair-drive-in-release.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-641230\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/bad-hair-drive-in-release-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"bad hair drive-in release\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/bad-hair-drive-in-release-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/bad-hair-drive-in-release-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/bad-hair-drive-in-release-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/bad-hair-drive-in-release.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>Justin Simien</strong>&#8216;s horror-satire <strong><em>Bad Hair</em></strong> is headed to Hulu this month, but if you&#8217;re craving the theatrical experience, here&#8217;s some good news – it&#8217;s going to drive-ins, too.
