Launched on Friday, Juneteenth, also known as Freedom Day, it will remain open until July 3rd, the day before Independence Day. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This project marks the birth of See in Black, a historic initiative founded by the photographers <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/joshuakissi/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">Joshua Kissi</a> and <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/micaiahcarter/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">Micaiah Carter</a>. 100% of the proceeds for the limited sale will go towards supporting civil rights, criminal justice reform, education and the arts, community building, and intersectionality, with funds benefiting <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.knowyourrightscamp.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Know Your Rights Camp</a>, <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://youthempowermentproject.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Youth Empowerment Project</a>, <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://nbjc.org/node?page=16%22%3B=\" target=\"_blank\">National Black Justice Coalition</a>, <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://blackfutureslab.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Black Futures Lab</a>, and <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://bailproject.org/\" target=\"_blank\">The Bail Project</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We do not merely make images of Black figures, we document history that is often unrecorded with intentionality, respect, nuance, and care,&#8221; Kissi and Carter write. &#8220;We serve as a platform for Black people to stand proudly in their permanence.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team continues, &#8220;Historically, Black people have been on the receiving end of the camera lens as the subject matter. The gaze by which we were viewed was not ours. Now, it&#8217;s vital that we are narrators of how our stories are told and how we&#8217;re seen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;With the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, David McAtee, Tony McDade, and other Black people at the hands of law enforcement, See In Black formed as a collective of Black photographers to dismantle white supremacy and systematic oppression.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>From <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.braylendion.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Braylen Dion</a>&#8216;s tender portrait of his baby cousin to <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/internetbby/\" target=\"_blank\">Kennedi Carter</a>&#8216;s stirring exploration of Black womanhood in the American South, each one of these remarkable photos warrants careful viewing in person, not just today but every day. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;As a Black photographer, I always felt like I had the due diligence to tell the truth &#8212; to put something that felt near and dear to my heart out there in the best way possible,&#8221; Kissi recently told <em><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.artifactuprising.com/stories/see-in-black\" target=\"_blank\">Artifact Uprising</a></em>. &#8220;If it impacts the next kid, I could go to sleep that night. I feel like I&#8217;m doing my job as long as it&#8217;s impacting somebody in the world to feel more seen or to feel more heard. I feel like I&#8217;m doing exactly what I&#8217;m supposed to be doing as a Black photographer and a storyteller.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All the photos are currently available as large-format fine art prints. For just $100 a piece, and for a limited time only, any one of us can hold a piece of history&#8211;and support some of our nation&#8217;s most important and necessary causes in the process. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very excited for this platform to be the beginning of such a bigger picture,&#8221; Micaiah Carter writes <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CBoRH9Kl_kX/\" target=\"_blank\">on Instagram</a>. &#8220;With over 80+ it&#8217;s such a beautiful thing to see these images next to each other as a reflection of Black America in every facet. This is also a continuing thing, Round 2 and more is coming quickly&#8211;this is a lifetime community, not a performative moment.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Kennedi-Carter-38CB9F33-C3B7-42C6-A736-F0A6043AB2F4-1280x1600.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-143582\" srcset=\"https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Kennedi-Carter-38CB9F33-C3B7-42C6-A736-F0A6043AB2F4-1280x1600.jpeg 1280w, https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Kennedi-Carter-38CB9F33-C3B7-42C6-A736-F0A6043AB2F4-700x875.jpeg 700w, https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Kennedi-Carter-38CB9F33-C3B7-42C6-A736-F0A6043AB2F4-768x960.jpeg 768w, https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Kennedi-Carter-38CB9F33-C3B7-42C6-A736-F0A6043AB2F4-1229x1536.jpeg 1229w, https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Kennedi-Carter-38CB9F33-C3B7-42C6-A736-F0A6043AB2F4-610x762.jpeg 610w, https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Kennedi-Carter-38CB9F33-C3B7-42C6-A736-F0A6043AB2F4.jpeg 1586w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 339px) calc(100vw - 20px), (max-width: 740px) calc(100vw - 40px), 700px\"><figcaption><a href=\"https://seeinblack.com/Kennedi-Carter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">&#169;

So the BDC is looking at foreign policy, immigration, the media, nationalism and the environment in our Trump&#160;Revolution&#160;series. The environmental decisions made by Trump may very well have the most long lasting, destructive and &#160;far-reaching effects of anything that he has done.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Could you speak about what you see as the most important aspects facing the nation and the globe as a result of Trump White House policy on climate change?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Pulling out of the Paris accords was a devastating blow to international cooperation on reducing global warming. But it doesn&#8217;t stop there. Trump has literally put oil and coal lobbyists in leading positions at the EPA and other agencies as you can see on our exhibition site. He and his appointees have rescinded hundreds of regulations protecting the environment and stopping global warming. They are green-lighting fossil fuel projects at national parks around the country and deregulating our country&#8216;s largest polluters. From an ecological point of view the results are devastating.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How did you determine which photographers and stories you wanted to feature in the exhibition?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>&#8220;</strong>We looked at a broad range of projects from around the country. We wanted to make sure we had good geographic diversity as well as diversity in terms of subject matter. It was important to get the California wildfires in there but also to show rising sea levels, the melting of the&#160;permafrost&#160;in Alaska and the effect of fossil fuel companies that are continuing to pollute our environment in the American South.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/17a-Louisiana-2017-4-827-1280x1918.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-143691\" srcset=\"https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/17a-Louisiana-2017-4-827-1280x1918.jpg 1280w, https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/17a-Louisiana-2017-4-827-700x1049.jpg 700w, https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/17a-Louisiana-2017-4-827-768x1151.jpg 768w, https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/17a-Louisiana-2017-4-827-1025x1536.jpg 1025w, https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/17a-Louisiana-2017-4-827-1366x2048.jpg 1366w, https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/17a-Louisiana-2017-4-827-610x914.jpg 610w, https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/17a-Louisiana-2017-4-827.jpg 1668w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 339px) calc(100vw - 20px), (max-width: 740px) calc(100vw - 40px), 700px\"><figcaption><em>April 2017, Louisiana.

Exxon&#8217;s reporting consistently lacks enough detail to comply with regulations and does not provide nearby residents crucial information about their potential exposures to dangerous pollution.</em> <em>&#169; Stacy Kranitz</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Could you discuss the interconnections that exists between these various projects, such as the melting polar caps and rising sea levels, and their impact on states as far apart as Alaska and Florida?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It has been well documented at this point that there is no place on earth, and certainly not in the US, that has not been strongly affected by climate change. From the rising sea levels, to the increasing wildfires, to the extinction of species, we are in the midst of an interconnected environmental disaster that we have not yet begun to understand or to cope with. This is affecting Americans from Alaska to Florida to Maine.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Could you speak about how photographs can convey the issues of climate change, and how visualizing the issues at stake help people better understand the scale and scope of the crisis?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;As with many things, we frequently see a statistic that gives you a percentage or a degree. It can be very hard to actually visualize and understand the crisis at hand. The photos from our exhibition on the&#160;enormous&#160;wildfires ripping through California or the indigenous peoples in Alaska&#160;or the lives of African Americans in Louisiana&#8217;s Cancer Alley are undeniable documents that bring the crisis home.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Many people feel overwhelmed by the issues raised by climate crisis. Do you have any suggestions for how they can contribute the cause?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The BDC&#8217;s mission is not to tell people&#160;how to live and I think everyone needs to evaluate their own lifestyle and decide what is right for them. Small changes and increased awareness do make a big difference however.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;One of the biggest differences&#160;people&#160;can make is simply turning off their air conditioners. One air conditioner often uses more electricity than everything else in your house combined. Turning off AC when you&#8217;re not home goes a long way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Giving up meat is another step people can take in helping to protect the environment: the waste products and intensive feeding process for the millions of animals that we slaughter each year is catastrophic. And there are now quite good soy products available that taste very much like meat.&#160;&#8220;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Recycling, which many of us already do, makes a big difference but I find that many people don&#8217;t actually recycle correctly so learning about local guidelines can be a big step. Improperly recycling means that most or all of what you put in a recycle bin may get thrown into a landfill.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Of course driving a car less, riding a bike, flying less frequently, line drying your laundry and many more small changes add up to a real difference. Educating your children and neighbors about the importance of conservation&#160;is also important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Lastly,&#160;people can&#160;reach out to&#160;their&#160;local representatives to let them know that&#160;they&#160;care about this and vote for candidates that support&#160;their&#160;way of life and will keep the earth in better shape for our children.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ThomasB_BDC_PressImages_001-1280x1600.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-143693\" srcset=\"https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ThomasB_BDC_PressImages_001-1280x1600.jpg 1280w, https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ThomasB_BDC_PressImages_001-700x875.jpg 700w, https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ThomasB_BDC_PressImages_001-768x960.jpg 768w, https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ThomasB_BDC_PressImages_001-1229x1536.jpg 1229w, https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ThomasB_BDC_PressImages_001-1638x2048.jpg 1638w, https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ThomasB_BDC_PressImages_001-610x763.jpg 610w, https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ThomasB_BDC_PressImages_001-scaled.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 339px) calc(100vw - 20px), (max-width: 740px) calc(100vw - 40px), 700px\"><figcaption>Construction begins on the Auberge Beach Residences &#38; Spa in Fort Lauderdale-by-the-Sea.

Esegon says that she likes to be scratched behind her ears and behind her leg, saying that it calms her down, and puts her at ease.</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Years ago, on assignment from <em>TIME</em> magazine, the photojournalist <a href=\"https://www.justinmott.com/\">Justin Mott</a> went undercover in Hanoi to document the black-market sale of rhino horn; posing as a buyer, he held a severed horn in his hands. Like every other time he&#8217;s witnessed animal cruelty, the photographer wasn&#8217;t able to shake it, and the killing and suffering of rhinos continued to haunt him.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The memory of that severed horn stayed with Mott for about a decade&#8211;until in 2019, he traveled to Kenya&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.olpejetaconservancy.org/\">Ol Pejeta Conservancy</a> to meet the <a href=\"https://donate.olpejetaconservancy.org/projects/Sudan\">last two northern white rhinos</a>, Najin and her daughter Fatu, in person. &#8220;There I was in Kenya, touching the horn of Najin and feeling her in my hand,&#8221; he remembers. &#8220;I was so overwhelmed with a variety of emotions. It was just so damn powerful. I can&#8217;t even explain it properly.&#8221;&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a feeling the caretakers and guards at the Ol Pejeta Conservancy can understand&#8211;and it&#8217;s one that inspires them to risk their lives for the rhinos under their protection. As the first chapter in <a href=\"https://www.justinmott.com/kindred-guardians\"><em>Kindred Guardians</em></a>, Mott&#8217;s ongoing, self-funded project about people who care for animals, <a href=\"https://www.justinmott.com/northern-white-rhinos-kenya\"><em>No Man&#8217;s Land</em></a> tells their story.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Portfolio-Wildlife-photojournalist-Justin-Mott_014-1280x853.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-143786\" srcset=\"https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Portfolio-Wildlife-photojournalist-Justin-Mott_014-1280x853.jpg 1280w, https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Portfolio-Wildlife-photojournalist-Justin-Mott_014-700x467.jpg 700w, https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Portfolio-Wildlife-photojournalist-Justin-Mott_014-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Portfolio-Wildlife-photojournalist-Justin-Mott_014-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Portfolio-Wildlife-photojournalist-Justin-Mott_014-610x407.jpg 610w, https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Portfolio-Wildlife-photojournalist-Justin-Mott_014.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 339px) calc(100vw - 20px), (max-width: 740px) calc(100vw - 40px), 700px\"><figcaption><em>The shadow of Zacharia Kipkirui, 41, casts on Najin, one of two remaining northern white rhinos in the world. Kipkirui has worked at the conservancy for 14 years and has been with Fatu and Najin since they arrived at Ol Pejeta from Dvur Kralove Zoo in the Czech Republic in 2009.</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Sudan, the last remaining male of the northern white rhino species, died in 2018. He left behind a legacy that&#8217;s carried on by his daughter, Najin, and granddaughter, Fatu, at Ol Pejeta. At the conservancy, the rhinos live under the watchful eyes of caretakers and members of the NPR (National Police Reservists), as they patrol the area for potential poachers, who&#8211;along with habitat loss&#8211;have driven the sub-species to the brink of extinction.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Mott, the first challenge was gaining access to Ol Pejeta. &#8220;People can come to see Fatu and Najin, as the public is able to view them from a distance from behind a protective fence,&#8221; he says. But Mott is not a conventional wildlife photographer; his goal wasn&#8217;t to photograph the animals from a distance but to capture their relationships with people up-close. For that, he needed special permission, and in the end, his persistence, dedication to the cause, and willingness to be unobtrusive opened doors.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On his first trip to Ol Pejeta, the photojournalist spent about two weeks camping on the conservancy grounds, along with volunteers, researchers, and other journalists. He woke up every day at 4:30 in the morning, donned a headlamp, and made a cold cup of instant coffee station before continuing on through the bush and arriving at the conservancy gates an hour later&#8211;just in time to see the sunrise. The rest of his days were devoted to shadowing Zacharia and Peter, two of the rhino caregivers at Ol Pejeta, and documenting their work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The life of a rhino guardian is marked by passion and sacrifice. &#8220;Since the conservancy is so massive and on its own piece of land, many of the rangers and caretakers live far away from their families in an onsite camp and ultimately spend more time with the rhinos than they do with their families,&#8221; Mott explains. They spend 21 days on the job and six days off with their families.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Portfolio-Wildlife-photojournalist-Justin-Mott_013-1280x853.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-143788\" srcset=\"https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Portfolio-Wildlife-photojournalist-Justin-Mott_013-1280x853.jpg 1280w, https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Portfolio-Wildlife-photojournalist-Justin-Mott_013-700x467.jpg 700w, https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Portfolio-Wildlife-photojournalist-Justin-Mott_013-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Portfolio-Wildlife-photojournalist-Justin-Mott_013-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Portfolio-Wildlife-photojournalist-Justin-Mott_013-610x407.jpg 610w, https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Portfolio-Wildlife-photojournalist-Justin-Mott_013.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 339px) calc(100vw - 20px), (max-width: 740px) calc(100vw - 40px), 700px\"><figcaption><em>The NPR (National Police Reservists) patrol Ol Pejeta&#8217;s 360 km2 (140 sq mi) conservancy around the clock, even camping overnight in the bush with their weapons protecting the grounds from poachers.</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For the rangers, mortal danger is a fact of life. &#8220;They risk their lives daily,&#8221; the photographer says. &#8220;One of the rangers I got to know, who is only in his late twenties, had gotten in a firefight with some poachers and had to kill them in self-defense. Not only are they risking their lives by dealing with deadly poachers, but they also patrol and camp through the night surrounded by deadly predators. I have so much respect for them.&#8221;&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, despite the dangers, life at Ol Pejeta could be slow and peaceful, and for Mott, those quiet moments were some of the most precious. &#8220;The guys and the rhinos pretty much do the same thing every day: feed them some carrots and let them into the larger pasture,&#8221; he tells us. &#8220;The rhinos eat, drink, poop, nap, repeat.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Sometimes, the guys rest in the fields with them. Sometimes, they observe the rhinos while sitting on a gigantic pile of rhino feces. I just like to be there to observe and capture all these little things. It might seem monotonous, but it&#8217;s beautiful and special to be allowed into someone&#8217;s life and to be able to capture the little nuances.&#8221;&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Portfolio-Wildlife-photojournalist-Justin-Mott_022-1-1280x853.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-143791\" srcset=\"https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Portfolio-Wildlife-photojournalist-Justin-Mott_022-1-1280x853.jpg 1280w, https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Portfolio-Wildlife-photojournalist-Justin-Mott_022-1-700x467.jpg 700w, https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Portfolio-Wildlife-photojournalist-Justin-Mott_022-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Portfolio-Wildlife-photojournalist-Justin-Mott_022-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Portfolio-Wildlife-photojournalist-Justin-Mott_022-1-610x407.jpg 610w, https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Portfolio-Wildlife-photojournalist-Justin-Mott_022-1.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 339px) calc(100vw - 20px), (max-width: 740px) calc(100vw - 40px), 700px\"><figcaption><em>Zacharia Kipkirui (left) and Peter Esegon (right) sit and watch over Fatu and Najin in their holding area at Ol Pejeta conservancy in Central Kenya.</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Mott forged friendships with the caretakers that he maintains today. &#8220;I became closest with Zacharia, the lead caretaker, as we talked all day and learned about each other,&#8221; he tells us. &#8220;His father was a ranger, and he loves Fatu and Najin like family.&#8221;<br><br>That bond between caretaker and rhino goes both ways. &#8220;When Fatu or Najin got too close to me or the caretakers felt I was in a potentially dangerous situation, they would talk to them, and surprisingly, they would listen. It&#8217;s amazing to witness a human talking to an animal of that stature and having them listen.&#8221;&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The safety of the animals was just as important to Mott as his own, especially when it came to getting close. &#8220;My project is all about capturing intimate moments between people and animals, and at the same time, I must make sure everything is all done ethically and that people understand the context of why these people get close to the animals they are helping.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Portfolio-Wildlife-photojournalist-Justin-Mott_006-1280x959.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-143792\" srcset=\"https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Portfolio-Wildlife-photojournalist-Justin-Mott_006-1280x959.jpg 1280w, https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Portfolio-Wildlife-photojournalist-Justin-Mott_006-700x525.jpg 700w, https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Portfolio-Wildlife-photojournalist-Justin-Mott_006-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Portfolio-Wildlife-photojournalist-Justin-Mott_006-1536x1151.jpg 1536w, https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Portfolio-Wildlife-photojournalist-Justin-Mott_006-610x457.jpg 610w, https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Portfolio-Wildlife-photojournalist-Justin-Mott_006.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 339px) calc(100vw - 20px), (max-width: 740px) calc(100vw - 40px), 700px\"><figcaption><em>A portrait of Peter Esegon, 47, one of the primary caretakers of Fatu and Najin at Ol Pejeta conservancy in Central Kenya.</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;For example, these caretakers spend more time with the rhinos than they do with their own families, and the only reason the caretakers can get close to the rhinos is that the rhinos have grown up in captivity. You couldn&#8217;t do this with wild rhinos&#8211;nor should you&#8211;and it&#8217;s important my work conveys that message.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At one point during Mott&#8217;s visit, Zacharia and Peter invited him to visit the grave belonging to Sudan, the last male of the species. While attempts were made to mate Sudan during his lifetime, they were unsuccessful, and his death was a devastating blow not only to those who knew him but to conversationalists around the world.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;They asked me if I wanted to come along with them to see Sudan&#8217;s grave, a short distance from where Fatu and Najin roam daily,&#8221; the photographer remembers. &#8220;While we were, there I saw some families come by to teach their children about the plight of the rhinos. It was so sad to watch the children process this, but I&#8217;m glad people are teaching the youth about these issues.&#8221;&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rhino horn is sold as part of the wildlife trade in Vietnam, China, South Korea, and beyond, due in part to its rumored medicinal properties. Rhino horns are unique because they are composed entirely of keratin, the same substance that makes up fingernails and hair, although there is no evidence to suggest it can treat any illness in humans. &#8220;When I talked to the caretakers about how and why people consume the horn on false beliefs, they were just so disappointed and confused. It&#8217;s challenging for them.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Ovum-Procedure-Ol-Pejeta_Web-Resolution_Justin-Mott_035.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-143793\" srcset=\"https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Ovum-Procedure-Ol-Pejeta_Web-Resolution_Justin-Mott_035.jpg 1200w, https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Ovum-Procedure-Ol-Pejeta_Web-Resolution_Justin-Mott_035-700x467.jpg 700w, https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Ovum-Procedure-Ol-Pejeta_Web-Resolution_Justin-Mott_035-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Ovum-Procedure-Ol-Pejeta_Web-Resolution_Justin-Mott_035-610x407.jpg 610w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 339px) calc(100vw - 20px), (max-width: 740px) calc(100vw - 40px), 700px\"><figcaption><em>Ol Pejeta rhino caretakers try to rock Najin into position on the ground after she is slightly sedated to prepare her for the procedure where she will fully undergo anesthesia.</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, there might be reason to hope. Earlier this year, Mott returned to Ol Pejeta for a second time to document a historic procedure by the <a href=\"http://www.biorescue.org/project.html\">BioRescue Program</a>&#8211;a collaborative effort by Ol Pejeta Conservancy, the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research (Leibniz-IZW), Avantea, Dv?r Kr&#225;lov&#233; Zoo, and the Kenya Wildlife Service&#8211;in which veterinarians and scientists harvested eggs from Najin and Fatu.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The eggs were then moved to Italy, where an embryo was created with semen from deceased males of the species. The ultimate hope is that the embryos can be transferred into a female southern white rhino, a surrogate mother, who will then give birth to a healthy calf and save the subspecies from being lost forever.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Ovum-Procedure-Ol-Pejeta_Web-Resolution_Justin-Mott_041.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-143794\" srcset=\"https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Ovum-Procedure-Ol-Pejeta_Web-Resolution_Justin-Mott_041.jpg 1200w, https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Ovum-Procedure-Ol-Pejeta_Web-Resolution_Justin-Mott_041-700x467.jpg 700w, https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Ovum-Procedure-Ol-Pejeta_Web-Resolution_Justin-Mott_041-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Ovum-Procedure-Ol-Pejeta_Web-Resolution_Justin-Mott_041-610x407.jpg 610w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 339px) calc(100vw - 20px), (max-width: 740px) calc(100vw - 40px), 700px\"><figcaption><em>Najin, the elder of the two northern white rhinos, is looked after by one of the Kenya Wildlife Service Veterinary staff while undergoing anesthesia during the ovum pick up procedure on Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya.</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Mott tells us, &#8220;Each chapter is supposed to be a one time visit, but since this story has resonated with me, I&#8217;ve been back a second time (to document the procedure) and have plans to continue to document this story as it unfolds.&#8221; In the meantime, he has stayed in touch with the team at Ol Pejeta. &#8220;We collaborate quite a bit on charitable events, and I donate and do whatever I can to help their cause,&#8221; he says. &#8220;My project is completely self-funded at this point, and a series of each chapter of my images is donated to the people and organizations I document.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Saving a subspecies with only two surviving members is a historic undertaking&#8211;but despite the odds, Mott says the caretakers and rangers at Ol Pejeta hold onto hope for a better future, just as he once held onto Najin&#8217;s horn. &#8220;Many of the caretakers are optimistic that if they do their part, the rest of the world will do its part too,&#8221; he tells me. &#8220;I hope they are right. They see the worst of humanity, but they see the best of the animal kingdom.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://donate.olpejetaconservancy.org/projects/Sudan\">You can donate to Ol Pejeta and support the incredible work they are doing here</a>.

A visual storyteller, arts educator, and journalist, Maxon employs an interdisciplinary approach that acknowledges the socio-historical context to his work in order to create a space for multiple voices to address the issues at stake.</p> \n<p>Maxon recently won the <a href=\"https://localhost/awards2020/project_development\">2020 CENTER Project Development Grant</a> for <em>Livin’ the </em>Dream, a participatory media project made in collaboration with artists Leslie Castellano and Laura Montagna that brings together incarcerated people held at the Humboldt County Correction Facility in Eureka, CA. The program is one chapter of three that navigates substance abuse recovery for the currently and formerly incarcerated in Humboldt County.</p> \n<p>Individuals who participated in prison-based treatment followed by a community-based program post incarceration were 7 times more likely to be drug free and 3 times less likely to be arrested for criminal behavior than those not receiving treatment. Yet, of the roughly $81,000 California spends annually to house each of its prison inmates, just $2,478 (3%) just goes toward rehabilitation programs (2018-2019 fiscal year).</p> \n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\">\n <img src=\"https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Justin_Maxon10-1280x890.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-143660\" />\n</figure> \n<p>Inspired by a 2015 study on visualization techniques in goal achievement published by the Journal of Consulting Psychology released a study on visualization techniques in goal achievement, Maxon recognized the power of belief in helping individuals increase their capacities for achievement.</p> \n<p>He invited each participant to identify their dream — being a surfer, drummer, boat captain, motivational speaker, wizard — and invited them to act out the role for a series of photographs. The participant was then given their portrait, which they then cut out and set into a collage depicting the landscape of their desires in which they were the central protagonist.</p> \n<p>Each subject then captioned their work to give voice to their dream, their words speaking to the very power of visualization and art therapy. “I don’t know where to start. The inspiration for making art is to strengthen myself in the process. This is the first time I have ever gotten into a project,” Raymond writes.</p> \n<p>“This project has helped me realize things I didn’t know about myself. I didn’t realize the strength I had…also the beauty in the other people as well as myself. My art is a different type of art—it isn’t drawing or making shit…it is like a form of art of the mind. Thought it endless. There is more than one possible way to think. For myself, I hope to spread strength and love.”</p> \n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\">\n <img src=\"https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Justin_Maxon12-scaled.gif\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-143662\" />\n</figure> \n<p><em>All images: © Justin Maxon</em></p> \n<span class=\"inf_infusionsoft_bottom_trigger\"></span>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.featureshoot.com/2020/07/inspiring-incarcerated-individuals-to-visualize-their-dreams-in-photos/\">Inspiring Incarcerated Individuals to Visualize Their Dreams in Photos</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.featureshoot.com\">Feature Shoot</a>.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 14 Jul 2020 16:17:56 +0000","feedId":922,"bgimg":"https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Justin_Maxon08-1280x1006.jpg","linkMd5":"2844c1cc0238d62bdc7f022920197888","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn24@2020_6/2020/08/16/13-47-55-733_ce87248f62c27bf9.webp","destWidth":1280,"destHeight":1006,"author":"Miss Rosen","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Justin_Maxon08-1280x1006.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn27@2020_4/2020/08/16/13-47-56-164_ce87248f62c27bf9.webp","https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Justin_Maxon05-1280x853.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn3@2020_2/2020/08/16/13-47-56-319_0c926c590c327ff6.webp","https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Justin_Maxon10-1280x890.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx20/cdn55@2020_1/2020/08/16/13-47-55-901_6c270127a9b54398.webp","https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Justin_Maxon12-scaled.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn15@2020_2/2020/08/16/13-47-58-323_c4beaa081d4ee9a2.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 21:47:55","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 21:47:55","title":"The BirdLife Australia Photography Awards Celebrates Conservation","link":"https://www.featureshoot.com/?p=143764","description":"<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/email-header-photo-awards-open-1280x340.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-143769\" srcset=\"https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/email-header-photo-awards-open-1280x340.jpg 1280w, https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/email-header-photo-awards-open-700x186.jpg 700w, https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/email-header-photo-awards-open-768x204.jpg 768w, https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/email-header-photo-awards-open-1536x408.jpg 1536w, https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/email-header-photo-awards-open-2048x544.jpg 2048w, https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/email-header-photo-awards-open-610x162.jpg 610w, https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/email-header-photo-awards-open-scaled.jpg 2560w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 339px) calc(100vw - 20px), (max-width: 740px) calc(100vw - 40px), 700px\"></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bird-behaviour-1280x1920.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-143766\" srcset=\"https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bird-behaviour-1280x1920.jpg 1280w, https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bird-behaviour-700x1050.jpg 700w, https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bird-behaviour-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bird-behaviour-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bird-behaviour-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bird-behaviour-610x915.jpg 610w, https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bird-behaviour.jpg 1451w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 339px) calc(100vw - 20px), (max-width: 740px) calc(100vw - 40px), 700px\"><figcaption>&#8216;A Butterfly Snatch&#8217; &#169; Greg Norman, Winner of the Bird Behaviour Category 2019. Rainbow Bee-eater, Wyndham, Western Australia<br><br>&#8220;This shot was taken on a day where I was concentrating solely on bee-eaters in flight and feeding. They would perch in bushes along the bank of a dam then fly out over the water to catch an insect, which was usually a dragonfly; however, every once in a while, they would follow the base of the dam bank and grab a moth or butterfly. <br><br>&#8220;I could easily see where the bird flew back to with its catch, then I could just walk to that bush quietly to get the bird eating. The bee-eaters always throw their food up for a repositioning, and this is where I captured a burst of frames. I gained about four different series of this butterfly being thrown up, and each time, it was smaller and more tattered. Bee-eaters are such fun subjects.&#8221; </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Declines in bird numbers are often an early indication of wider environmental problems,&#8221; the team at <a href=\"http://birdlife.org.au/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">BirdLife Australia</a>, Australia&#8217;s largest independent, not-for-profit organization devoted to bird conservation, writes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birds are essential members of our ecosystem; they control pests, and they pollinate crops. Unfortunately, even species seen as common are in decline. In places around the world, bird populations have suffered due to insecticide use and habitat loss, among other threats. Over the course of 50 years, North America lost 3 billion birds, and the numbers warn of a potential collapse in environmental health. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Australia, <a href=\"http://birdlife.org.au/\">BirdLife</a> works to protect delicate native species from extinction, a danger that&#8217;s been intensified by recent bushfires. Their special interest group BirdLife Photography plays an important part in raising awareness and championing the cause through powerful images. The annual <a href=\"https://www.birdlifephotoaward.org.au/enter\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">BirdLife Australia Photography Awards</a> is a celebration of the country&#8217;s extraordinary, diverse wildlife&#8211;and a call to action that must be heeded around the world. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2020 BirdLife Australia Photography Awards are open for entries through Monday, August 3rd. This year, there are nine main categories: bird portrait, bird in flight; bird behaviour; backyard birds; human impact; birds in the landscape; fairy-wrens, emu-wrens &#38; grasswrens; plus a youth and portfolio award. The category winners will receive a $1,000 cash prize, and the portfolio winner will take home $5,000 cash. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>During this difficult time for bird populations in Australia and beyond, photography can serve as an enduring reminder of the beauty and fragility of the natural world. As these awards remind us year after year, the health and well-being of bird populations has far-reaching implications for us all. When they suffer, we suffer, but when they thrive, we do too. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The BirdLife Australia Photography Awards are sponsored bu Nikon Australia and Lake Cowal Foundation. <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.birdlifephotoaward.org.au/enter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Enter here</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bird-portrait-1-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-143770\"><figcaption>&#8216;Southern Cassowary&#8217; &#169; Jun Matsui, Winner of the Bird Portrait Category 2019.

She&#8217;s always longed for the sea and the sun, even after moving to New York with her family as an adult. She&#8217;s a painter of landscapes; she knits sweaters and blankets. This summer, she started working with clay sculptures. She&#8217;s also anorexic and has struggled with her mental health for as long as her daughter can remember.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Muscat, now an adult, photographer, and filmmaker, also spent her early years in the Mediterranean, and her mother&#8217;s illness informed her world from a young age. &#8220;I remember she would run after me and my sister when we were young, trying to measure our waists to see where we stood,&#8221; the artist says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;She used to be very depressed, paranoid, and suicidal. I&#8217;ve always had to be an adult, even at ten years old. I didn&#8217;t know a ten-year-old shouldn&#8217;t be responsible for someone&#8217;s life&#8211;especially a person who was supposed to be in charge of my life.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Muscat spent her early childhood with her mother, but Salvina returned to Malta when her daughter was thirteen years old and remained until she was eighteen. As a recent college graduate, the photographer has been living with her mother, father, and sister in New York during quarantine. Photographing Salvina has become part of her routine, and in some ways, it&#8217;s also served as a coping skill.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Muscat uses a simple 35mm camera with flash for this series, resulting in raw, harsh lighting. She&#8217;s used an old digital camera that audibly &#8220;screeches&#8221; when it focuses, and recently, she&#8217;s distorted some of the images in Photoshop to reflect the way her mother sees herself&#8211;and how she sometimes sees her mother.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although Salvina has seen the photographs, her daughter doesn&#8217;t feel she&#8217;s grasped their meaning within their relationship. &#8220;These days, it takes her a long time to process things or fully comprehend anything I&#8217;m saying,&#8221; Muscat says. &#8220;It feels like I&#8217;m talking to a child most times.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;When I say how I truly feel or that she traumatized me and my sister, she just responds with &#8216;I&#8217;m sorry.&#8217; It&#8217;s an automated response, but my feelings don&#8217;t register. Next week, I can tell her the same thing again, and she has no awareness of it.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Conversations at home are often limited to a few words, and Salvina&#8217;s pain, paranoia, and anxiety weigh heavily on her daughter. &#8220;For example, she blames when she eats a slice of cake&#8211;because cake starts with the letter &#8216;c&#8217; and my name is Chelsea and starts with the letter &#8216;c,&#8217;&#8221; the artist says. &#8220;She tells me I&#8217;m controlling her and making her gain weight so I don&#8217;t gain weight, and that might be my entire interaction with her for the day.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ongoing project and the resulting images might not bring about healing or acknowledgment from Salvina&#8211;of her daughter&#8217;s trauma or her accomplishments&#8211;but perhaps that&#8217;s not their purpose. Even if Salvina can&#8217;t process their relationship, maybe her daughter can. The artist tells us, &#8220;It&#8217;s about accepting her for who she is and trying to make peace with the fact that the mother I once knew does not exist, no matter how badly I want a support system.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She&#8217;s also made visible something that used to be tightly locked away, secret and invisible. &#8220;Filming and photographing is the only way I can show people what I go through,&#8221; she tells me. &#8220;I could never describe the details before, and it&#8217;s easier to see it and hear it. I also hope other people can relate out there and know that they aren&#8217;t alone.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the future, Muscat hopes to include pictures of her mother during happy moments too, like when she&#8217;s at work on a painting or sculpture. &#8220;When she is passionate about a project, she&#8217;ll do research, find tools and materials lying around, and get to work right away,&#8221; the photographer says. She admires her mother&#8217;s creativity and always has.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Muscat loves her mother. She also mourns for her. The photographs are a testament to both. &#8220;I think I&#8217;ll always feel like a lost kid wandering the streets, wanting and trying to go home, but knowing such a place doesn&#8217;t exist,&#8221; she admits. She visits Gozo, the island where both she and Salvina grew up, whenever she can. It&#8217;s where she goes to escape and to forget. Like her mother, she loves the sun and the sea.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/3.-Queen-bee-1280x1978.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-143701\" srcset=\"https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/3.-Queen-bee-1280x1978.jpg 1280w, https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/3.-Queen-bee-700x1082.jpg 700w, https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/3.-Queen-bee-768x1187.jpg 768w, https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/3.-Queen-bee-994x1536.jpg 994w, https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/3.-Queen-bee-1325x2048.jpg 1325w, https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/3.-Queen-bee-610x943.jpg 610w, https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/3.-Queen-bee-scaled.jpg 1656w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 339px) calc(100vw -

Throughout the years, Print Swap photographers have exhibited in Los Angeles, Sydney, London, Paris, Berlin, Hyderabad, with <a href=\"https://www.featureshoot.com/2020/07/submit-to-the-print-swap-exhibition-in-athens-greece/\">an exhibition in Athens</a> on the horizon.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, in 2020, we are launching the <a href=\"https://www.blurb.com/b/10227887-the-print-swap-a-project-by-feature-shoot\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">first-ever Print Swap photo book</a>, curated by our Founder Alison Zavos and comprising selected images from artists who participated in The Print Swap in 2019. The tradition of the physical, tangible photograph has always been at the heart of The Print Swap, and we couldn&#8217;t be happier to be sharing these images in a fresh, new way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you so much to all the artists who have made the Print Swap what it is today, from the streets of Nairobi to the forests of Rio, the neighborhoods of Mumbai to the skyscrapers of Manhattan, the dunes of Namibia to the trams of Lisbon&#8211;and far beyond. <a href=\"https://www.blurb.com/b/10227887-the-print-swap-a-project-by-feature-shoot\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Find the new book here</a>.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As always photographers can submit to The Print Swap by tagging their best images #theprintswap. Selected photographers give a print and receive a print of their choice delivered to their doorsteps for just $40 per image. Every photographer who participates in The Print Swap will be part of our fall exhibition at Blank Wall Gallery in Athens.

Swap, an international project by Feature Shoot, is headed to Berlin for an exhibition at <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://bba-gallery.com/\" target=\"_blank\">BBA Circle&#160;Gallery</a>&#160;in the heart of the city. After months of gallery closures, we are thrilled to be showing these stunning photographs together under one roof. To comply with social distancing regulations, we&#8217;ll forgo a traditional evening opening and instead keep the show open throughout the entire day (11AM-8PM) of July 25th, 2020. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This exhibition, open for one day near Berlin&#8217;s bustling Alexanderplatz square, features photographers from around the globe, including those based on the United States, Costa Rica, Mexico, Brazil, Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, Belgium, Italy, Greece, Spain, France, the Netherlands, Norway, Romania, Slovenia, Russia, India, Hong Kong, Singapore, Japan, Kenya, Australia, and beyond. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Print Swap has always reminded us of the global power of photography&#8211;and the importance of coming together across barriers and boundaries&#8211;and perhaps this exhibition serves to reinforce those ideals at a time when we need it most. The Print Swap will be opening up again for submissions in the coming weeks, with a brand-new exhibition opportunity, so feel free to tag your photos #theprintswap for consideration and visit our <a href=\"https://www.theprintswap.com/\">website</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/theprintswap/\">Instagram</a> for updates. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Melting_paradise_Bernarda_Conic_Sardegna_2019_30x40cm-1280x1707.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-143610\" srcset=\"https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Melting_paradise_Bernarda_Conic_Sardegna_2019_30x40cm-1280x1707.jpg 1280w, https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Melting_paradise_Bernarda_Conic_Sardegna_2019_30x40cm-700x933.jpg 700w, https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Melting_paradise_Bernarda_Conic_Sardegna_2019_30x40cm-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Melting_paradise_Bernarda_Conic_Sardegna_2019_30x40cm-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Melting_paradise_Bernarda_Conic_Sardegna_2019_30x40cm-1536x2048.jpg 1536w, https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Melting_paradise_Bernarda_Conic_Sardegna_2019_30x40cm-610x813.jpg 610w, https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Melting_paradise_Bernarda_Conic_Sardegna_2019_30x40cm-scaled.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 339px) calc(100vw - 20px), (max-width: 740px) calc(100vw - 40px), 700px\"><figcaption>Melting paradise, Sardegna <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.nibera.eu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">&#169;

Hermit for three years. &#8220;I like to work as a freelancer: to [do] cosplays of my favorite characters, as well as reviews of video games.&#8221;</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>When the Russian photographer <a href=\"https://nataliaershova.photographer.ru/\">Natalia Ershova</a> was in school, working on her journalism degree, she fell ill. As a result, she was unable to leave home for two months. To combat the isolation and loneliness, she communicated with friends online. &#8220;I often stayed up at night, working on my diploma, and corresponding simultaneously with those in my networks,&#8221; she remembers.<br><br>It was during this time that she discovered many of her peers were staying at home voluntarily, without going into an office to work every day. One was a young woman she&#8217;s known since childhood; another was her husband&#8217;s former classmate, and a third studied at the same university as she did. While she had trouble adapting to life at home, she found others prefered it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It surprised me that some of them would not want to simply go for a walk in the park or visit the cinema&#8211;that they had chosen to stay at home of their own free will,&#8221; she says. &#8220;As it turned out, communicating via the internet and social media was quite enough for them.&#8221; Her surprise turned to curiosity, which in turn turned to understanding, resulting in <a href=\"https://nataliaershova.photographer.ru/?item=7218&#38;lang=eng\"><em>Journey to the edge of the room</em></a>, a project examining the emerging culture of people in big cities who prefer to remain mostly homebound.&#160;&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ershova believes the lifestyle appeals to people, particularly those in urban centers, because it offers a respite from the stress of constant communication and busy schedules. Everyone she met had a different reason for making the decision, whether it was for convenience or comfort, but they all did so out of choice, rather than necessity, and they were all active on the internet.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the course of about a year, she met more and more people who stayed at home, and although it took time, it wasn&#8217;t hard to find participants. &#8220;I started looking for people through mutual acquaintances,&#8221; she says. &#8220;One guy turned out to be the brother of my hairdresser, and several people wrote to me themselves after hearing about the project.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of them work remotely in creative fields, including programming, design, photography, and retouching. Some have financial support from family, and, while some might get most of their essentials delivered, they do leave home from time to time. &#8220;For example, one girl always goes for paints and brushes herself, once every few months,&#8221; the photographer explains. &#8220;Another couple goes once a year to a major Anime festival. They spend a long time sewing their costumes, and then they make the trip.&#8221;&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some longed to leave the city someday and dreamed of moving to a secluded house in the forest with plenty of space and privacy. Others imagined buying a yacht and living on the water. For most, they remained dreams for now, but in the meantime, an apartment sufficed.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And most were not entirely alone. They have friends and family come to visit, and many live with romantic partners or parents, as housing in Moscow remains expensive. She also met several pets and animal companions. &#8220;In one apartment I visited, I was greeted by a cloud of cats&#8211;just a cloud!&#8221; she remembers. &#8220;I could not count them all. I lost count at 21.&#8221;&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to photographing the people she met, she interviewed them about why they chose to stay at home and how many years they&#8217;d led that lifestyle. While she was initially surprised to learn so many people had chosen to spend most of their time at home&#8211;sometimes months at a time&#8211;Ershova realized that, in many ways, they might represent the direction of our culture in the age of the internet.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She could not have known when she began the project that the global coronavirus pandemic would leave much of the population under stay-at-home orders, but she does understand why it feels so prescient now. &#8220;All of my acquaintances and friends transitioned to working from home, and many liked it,&#8221; she reflects. &#8220;They liked not spending hours on the road and not having to follow office dress codes. I think the future lies in remote work, though it won&#8217;t be as extreme as the stay-at-home lifestyle we&#8217;re experiencing now&#8211;or that the people in my photos prefer.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ershova does see the appeal of life at home. There&#8217;s a certain freedom that comes with not having places to be and people to see, and she understands that now. Still, she doesn&#8217;t think she could ever fully embrace it herself. When restrictions lift, she&#8217;ll get back to traveling for work and pleasure, but perhaps the idea of home will have taken on a new layer of meaning.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Ershova_Natalia_12_Journey-to-the-edge-of-the-room.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-143633\" srcset=\"https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Ershova_Natalia_12_Journey-to-the-edge-of-the-room.jpg 1200w, https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Ershova_Natalia_12_Journey-to-the-edge-of-the-room-700x338.jpg 700w, https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Ershova_Natalia_12_Journey-to-the-edge-of-the-room-768x371.jpg 768w, https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Ershova_Natalia_12_Journey-to-the-edge-of-the-room-610x295.jpg 610w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 339px) calc(100vw - 20px), (max-width: 740px) calc(100vw - 40px), 700px\"><figcaption>Anna and Eliza, 30 years old.
