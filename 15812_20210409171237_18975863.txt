We are looking for presentations and workshops that explore the dimensions of space and material: 3D modelling and animation, Libre architecture, Open Source product design and other fields of digital making and manufacture. We are also seeking contributions that offer reflections on the ‘other dimensions’ of open source communities and that engage with <span class=\"caps\">FLOSS</span> tools in various contexts including but not limited to teaching, learning, practice and co-production. This represents a desire to address the future sustainability of the Libre Graphics movement, through a growth of the core projects and topics that will, we hope, allow us to welcome more and more <span class=\"caps\">FLOSS</span> projects and participants to our&nbsp;community.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<h3 id=\"a-history-of-gimp-lgm\">A History of <span class=\"caps\">GIMP</span> + <span class=\"caps\">LGM</span><a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"https://www.gimp.org/news/2016/01/12/libre-graphics-meeting-2016/#a-history-of-gimp-lgm\" title=\"Permanent link\">¶</a></h3> \n<p>Over 10 years ago the annual meetings of <span class=\"caps\">GIMP</span> developers branched out to <span class=\"caps\">LGM</span>, and we have been attending the event every year since.
