This prevents Insiders from selecting a channel. We have <a href=\"https://aka.ms/WIPSettingsFix\">posted a workaround on Answers</a>.</li>\n \t<li><strong>[BETA CHANNEL]</strong> We’re investigating reports from Insiders in the Beta Channel where after upgrading to Windows 11, they are not seeing the new Taskbar and the Start menu doesn’t work. To workaround this if you are impacted, please try going to Windows Update &#62; Update history, uninstalling the latest cumulative update for Windows, and the reinstall it by checking for updates.</li>\n \t<li>Start:\n<ul>\n \t<li>In some cases, you might be unable to enter text when using Search from Start or the Taskbar.

As a workaround, users can switch their input language via any of the following hardware keyboard shortcuts: Alt + Shift, Ctrl + Shift, or Win + Space (the third option is available only if Sandbox is full-screened).</li>\n \t<li>Within Windows Sandbox, the IME context menu does not launch after clicking the IME icon in the Taskbar. As workarounds, users can access the functionalities of the IME context menu with either of following methods:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Accessing the IME settings via Settings &#62; Time &#38; language &#62;  Language &#38; region &#62; (e.g. Japanese) three dots &#62; Language options &#62; (e.g. Microsoft IME) three dots &#62; Keyboard options.\n<ul>\n \t<li>Optionally, you may also enable the IME toolbar, an alternative UI to quickly invoke specific IME functions. Continuing from above, navigate to Keyboard options &#62; Appearance &#62; Use IME toolbar.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n \t<li>Using the unique set of hardware keyboard shortcuts associated with each IME-supported language. (See: <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/windows/microsoft-japanese-ime-da40471d-6b91-4042-ae8b-713a96476916\">Japanese IME Shortcuts</a>, <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/windows/microsoft-traditional-chinese-ime-ef596ca5-aff7-4272-b34b-0ac7c2631a38\">Traditional Chinese IME Shortcuts</a>).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n \t<li>Localization\n<ul>\n \t<li>There is an issue where some Insiders may be some missing translations from their user experience for a small subset of languages running the latest Insider Preview builds. To confirm if you have been impacted, <a href=\"https://aka.ms/UnderLocIssue\">please visit this Answers forum post</a> and follow the steps for remediation.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n \t<li>Chat from Microsoft Teams\n<ul>\n \t<li>Experience is localized for English (US) only. Additional languages and locales forthcoming.</li>\n \t<li>When you make an outgoing call, while you do not hear a ring tone, the user interface shows that the call is getting connected.</li>\n \t<li>In a video call, sometimes people videos freeze or display a black image. There is a workaround to this issue, which is to pin the video that freezes and unpin it to fix the problem.</li>\n \t<li>When switching between calls, the previous call is not automatically put on hold, so audio and video streams continue on both calls. Be sure to complete a call before taking another.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Microsoft Store</strong></h2>\nWe are beginning to roll out the Store update (version 22108.1401.0) with auto-scrolling on Spotlight, new gaming PDP (product detail page) design, and the new Ratings and Reviews dialog to Windows Insiders in the Beta Channel.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_175199\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1556\"]<a href=\"https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/44/2021/08/auto-scroll_Trim.gif\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-175199\" src=\"https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/44/2021/08/auto-scroll_Trim.gif\" alt=\"When browsing, we’ll automatically scroll through content so you can discover your next favorite app, movie, or game.\" width=\"1556\" height=\"1080\" /></a> When browsing, we’ll automatically scroll through content so you can discover your next favorite app, movie, or game.[/caption]\n<h2><strong>For developers</strong></h2>\nYou can download the latest Windows Insider SDK at <a href=\"https://aka.ms/windowsinsidersdk\">aka.ms/windowsinsidersdk</a>.
