Source: Carlos Ortega Click to enlarge</p></div>\n<p>There are a number of improvements in Figure 2: The variables are ordered by size, it is more obvious that the labels on the horizontal axis refer to both figures, the redundant homeowners and renter labels are no longer needed, and the tick marks and their labels are treated consistently in the two figures. It is very clear from Figure 2 that the largest change comes from the category with the smallest expenditure: a fact that is lost in Figure 1. We would still like to see these figures in horizontal bar charts rather than vertical ones so that the labels could be read more easily.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 10 Jan 2013 11:06:40 +0000","feedId":46447,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"de4bdf948832be35ac630cb9a6975b80","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Naomi Robbins","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/naomirobbins/files/2013/01/CO1-300x192.png":null,"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/naomirobbins/files/2013/01/CO-Bar-V2-300x138.png":null},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603079180317}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-10-19 11:46:20","updatedTime":"2020-10-19 11:46:20","feedId":46447,"fetchDate":"Mon, 19 Oct 2020 03:46:20 +0000","fetchMs":61,"handleMs":9,"totalMs":121937,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":10,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"45545bae64f98079bf9fa9362b52b0a1","hostName":"us-028*","requestId":"0c0d10cd38ed45688cfdce102f92771d_46447","contentType":"application/rss+xml; charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":0,"bgimgsTotal":0,"bgimgsGithubTotal":0,"articlesImgsTotal":2,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":0,"successGithubMap":{},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-09-07 03:41:50","updatedTime":"2020-09-07 06:04:20","id":46447,"name":"Effective Graphs","url":"http://blogs.forbes.com/naomirobbins/feed/","subscriber":69,"website":null,"icon":"https://blogs.forbes.com/favicon.ico","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx63/cdn61@2020_4/2020/09/06/21-59-59-205_df10b0c8fbc25b62.ico","description":"[Please go to 'Settings' to change your Tagline]","weekly":null,"link":null},"noPictureArticleList":[{"createdTime":"2020-10-19 11:48:22","updatedTime":"2020-10-19 11:48:22","id":null,"feedId":46447,"linkMd5":"de4bdf948832be35ac630cb9a6975b80"}],"tmpCommonImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBodyImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBgImgCdnBytes":0,"extra4":{"start":1603079180246,"total":0,"statList":[{"spend":62,"msg":"获取xml内容"},{"spend":9,"msg":"解释文章"},{"spend":0,"msg":"上传封面图到cdn"},{"spend":1,"msg":"修正封面图上传失败重新上传"},{"spend":121864,"msg":"正文链接上传到cdn"}]},"extra5":2,"extra6":0,"extra7ImgCdnFailResultVector":[null,null,null,null],"extra10_invalidATagHrefValue":{},"extra111_proxyServerAndStatMap":{"http://europe-56.herokuapp.com/":{"failCount":1,"successCount":0,"resultList":[null]},"http://us-51.herokuapp.com/":{"failCount":1,"successCount":0,"resultList":[null]},"http://us-040.herokuapp.com/":{"failCount":1,"successCount":0,"resultList":[null]},"http://us-027.herokuapp.com/":{"failCount":1,"successCount":0,"resultList":[null]}},"extra12ImgCdnSuccessResultVector":[],"successGithubMap":{},"failGithubMap":{}}
