Judge John G. Koeltl has ordered all parties to be ready for trial by <strong>November 12, 2021.</strong> He set a deadline of <strong>December 1, 2020,</strong> to notify the court if the parties are willing to enter settlement talks with a magistrate judge.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Attorneys for the Internet Archive have met with representatives for the publishers, but were unable to reach an agreement. &#8220;We had hoped to settle this needless lawsuit,” said Brewster Kahle, Internet Archive’s founder and Digital Librarian. “Right now the publishers are diverting attention and resources from where they should be focused: on helping students during this pandemic.&#8221;&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The scheduling order lays out this timeline:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Discovery must be completed by September 20, 2021;</li><li>Dispositive motions must be submitted by October 8, 2021;</li><li>Pretrial orders/motions must be submitted by October 29, 2021;</li><li>Parties must be ready for trial on 48 hours notice by November 12, 2021.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In June, Hachette Book Group, Inc., HarperCollins Publishers LLC, John Wiley &#38; Sons, Inc., and Penguin Random House LLC—with coordination by the <a href=\"https://publishers.org/\">Association of American Publishers</a>—filed a lawsuit to stop the Internet Archive from digitizing and lending books to the public, demanding that the non-profit library destroy 1.5 million digital books.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/home/index.html\"><em>Publishers Weekly</em></a> Senior Writer Andrew Albanese has been <a href=\"https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/digital/copyright/article/84228-publishers-internet-archive-propose-yearlong-discovery-plan-for-copyright-case.html\">covering the story</a> from the beginning. In a July 31st <a href=\"https://beyondthebookcast.com/internet-archive-responds-to-piracy-charges/\"><em>Beyond the Book</em> podcast</a> for the Copyright Clearance Center, Albanese shared his candid opinions about the lawsuit. &#8220;If this was to be a blow out, open-and-shut case for the publishers, what do the publishers and authors get?” Albanese asked. “I’d say nothing.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Honestly, a win in court on this issue will not mean more sales for books for publishers. Nor will it protect any authors or publisher from the vagaries of the Internet,&#8221; the <em>Publishers Weekly</em> journalist continued. “Here we are in the streaming age, 13 years after the ebook market took off, and we’re having a copyright battle, a court battle over crappy PDFs of mostly out-of-print books? I just don’t think it’s a good look for the industry.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to make the vast majority of 20th Century books accessible to digital learners, libraries such as the Internet Archive have been digitizing the physical books they own and lending them on a 1-to-1 “own to loan” basis—a legal framework called <a href=\"https://controlleddigitallending.org/\">Controlled Digital Lending</a>. Publishers refuse to sell ebooks to libraries, insisting on temporary licenses on restrictive terms.&#160; This business practice “threatens the purpose, values, and mission of libraries and archives in the United States,” <a href=\"https://kylecourtney.com/2020/05/18/libraries-do-not-need-permission-fair-use-first-sale-and-the-fallacy-of-permission-culture/\">explains</a> Kyle K. Courtney, copyright advisor to Harvard University Libraries. “It undermines the ability of the public (taxpayers!) to access the materials purchased with their money for their use in public libraries and state institutions, and further, it is short sighted, and not in the best interest of library patrons or the public at large.”&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Libraries have always had the right to buy and lend books. It’s at the core of a library’s mission,” said Kahle. “The Internet Archive would like to purchase ebooks, but the publishers won’t sell them to us, or to any library. Instead they are suing us to stop all learners from accessing the millions of digitized books in our library.”</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://blog.archive.org/2020/09/03/judge-sets-tentative-trial-date-for-november-2021/\">Judge Sets Tentative Trial Date for November 2021</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://blog.archive.org\">Internet Archive Blogs</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 03 Sep 2020 18:35:09 +0000","feedId":13061,"bgimg":"https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Court-Trial-1024x683.jpg","linkMd5":"1f696b26cd1c47e073a0966e3a6147b2","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn41@2020_6/2020/09/05/08-45-15-324_0c97cb2010bf8b9c.webp","destWidth":1024,"destHeight":683,"sourceBytes":78186,"destBytes":57216,"author":"Wendy Hanamura","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Court-Trial-1024x683.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn41@2020_6/2020/09/05/08-45-15-324_0c97cb2010bf8b9c.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599295514418},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 16:45:14","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 16:45:14","title":"The Legend of GayBlade","link":"http://blog.archive.org/?p=21307","description":"\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"http://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GayBlade-screenshot.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-21308\" srcset=\"http://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GayBlade-screenshot.png 640w, http://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GayBlade-screenshot-300x225.png 300w, http://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GayBlade-screenshot-624x468.png 624w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The recently released video game documentary <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Score_(TV_series)\">High Score</a> includes a sequence in the third episode about a game called GayBlade. GayBlade is one of the first commercially-sold LGTBQ-themed video games, a role-playing romp for Windows and Macintosh occasionally referred to as &#8220;Dungeons and Drag Queens&#8221;. Once thought to have been lost, the game’s software was recently discovered and preserved—<a href=\"https://archive.org/details/gayblade\">and is now available in the Internet Archive!</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although LGTBQ people have been creating video games since the earliest days of the industry, there were very few games before the 21st century that explicitly had LGTBQ themes. Game creator Ryan Best hoped to change that with GayBlade, remarking, &#8220;This game gives lesbians and gays—and straight people—a chance to strike back at homophobia from behind our computer screen.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"http://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gayblade-cover-1024x792.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-21309\" srcset=\"http://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gayblade-cover-1024x792.jpg 1024w, http://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gayblade-cover-300x232.jpg 300w, http://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gayblade-cover-768x594.jpg 768w, http://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gayblade-cover-1536x1188.jpg 1536w, http://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gayblade-cover-2048x1584.jpg 2048w, http://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gayblade-cover-624x483.jpg 624w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The game is definitely political, racy and unafraid to make waves, as it definitely did in 1992 when it was released. Players are tasked with exploring a deep dungeon filled with homophobic enemies, trying to rescue the Empress Nelda and return her to Castle GayKeep. Best (and co-creator John Theurer) filled the game with humorous spells, items and antagonists while still keeping it all within the traditional role-playing genre. There are over 13 levels and 1,300 different rooms in this dungeon, reflecting the remarkable amount of work put into it by its creators—truly a unique work of art.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After being lost in a move from Honolulu to San Francisco, the game was thought to have disappeared forever. In High Score, creator Ryan Best laments that he was unable to find any of the game files, and was not very hopeful he would ever find them. But that’s not the end of the story—between the close of filming and the release of the documentary, Best discovered another copy of his game. Thanks to efforts by the <a href=\"https://lgbtqgamearchive.com/\">LGTBQ Game Archive</a>, <a href=\"https://www.museumofplay.org/\">Strong Museum of Play</a>, and Internet Archive, it was preserved.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"http://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-28-at-10.21.21-AM-1024x768.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-21310\" srcset=\"http://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-28-at-10.21.21-AM-1024x768.png 1024w, http://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-28-at-10.21.21-AM-300x225.png 300w, http://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-28-at-10.21.21-AM-768x576.png 768w, http://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-28-at-10.21.21-AM-624x468.png 624w, http://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-28-at-10.21.21-AM.png 1278w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to experience GayBlade for yourself, it’s available in our emulated games collection.

Courtney, Copyright Advisor at Harvard University, spoke at a press conference about the copyright lawsuit against the Internet Archive brought by the publishers Hachette, HarperCollins, Wiley, and Penguin Random House.</em>&#160;<em>He holds a J.D. with distinction in Intellectual Property Law and a Master of Science in Library and Information Science&#160;(MSLIS) degree.&#160;Courtney is a published author and nationally recognized speaker&#160;on the topics of copyright, technology, libraries, and the law.</em>  <em>These are his remarks:</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Part of my work in scholarship is about the roles of copyright and the library landscape. I wrote the white paper on <a href=\"https://controlleddigitallending.org/\">Controlled Digital Lending</a> of library books with my coauthor David Hansen at Duke University Libraries. And it presents the legal rationale supporting the overview document called the <a href=\"https://controlleddigitallending.org/statement\">Position Statement on Controlled Digital Lending</a>, which has been <a href=\"https://controlleddigitallending.org/signatories\">endorsed</a> by many national library organizations, regional library consortia, specific library systems, themselves, individual librarians, and legal experts. Ultimately, though, this is about how libraries can do what they&#8217;ve always done, right? Lend books. The paper looks at the underpinnings of the library&#8217;s historical mission through the lens of both fair use and first sale, true critical rights that I think any library uses in their programs, right? Both for lending and preservation. And I discuss how libraries can legally lend digital copies of their print collections using this technology.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I&#8217;d like to point out that a CDL system is not a brand new concept, like Corynne stated: libraries loan books to the public. It&#8217;s what they do, for centuries. And libraries do not need permission or a license to loan those books that they have purchased or acquired. Copyright law covers those exact issues. But the difference here, I think, and some of the conflict is that the vendors and publishers have to ask permission, right? They must license. This is their business model. Historically, libraries are special creatures of copyright law; libraries have a legally authorized mandate, by the way, granted by Congress, to complete their mission to provide both access to materials. Congress actually placed all of these specialized copyright exemptions for libraries in the Copyright Act itself. So that&#8217;s kind of fun to look at library&#8217;s unique role in copyright law, they sit right in the middle, both housing the economic purpose of copyright: &#8220;we buy the books, we buy lots of books,&#8221; and the access purpose of copyright, which is, &#8220;we loan the books out to our users.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or if you want to put that in the constitutional narrative: libraries are promoting the progress of science and the useful arts. Libraries have historically provided unfettered access and freedom to the books that they purchase for their communities. Now, because of that, there&#8217;s multiple versions of CDL-like systems that are currently used in libraries. But I think the origin of the real legal underpinning concept was first explored by Professor Michelle Wu at Georgetown University School of Law in an article that she wrote that I read many times, &#8220;<a href=\"https://scholarship.law.georgetown.edu/facpub/699/\">Building a Collaborative Digital Collection</a>.&#8221; Later, the Internet Archive formed up the <a href=\"https://openlibrary.org/\">Open Library</a> Program, which Chris talked about, which was nine years ago. And other institutions are exploring this option right in their own individual libraries or part of consortia or within affinity groups.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s exciting to see, but at its core, Controlled Digital Lending is about replicating, through the Controlled Digital Lending Process, the legal and economically significant aspects of physical lending. And in other words, let&#8217;s put this simply: it continues to preserve the powers in the print. A library has these significant legal usage rights and they have great fiscal value in their collections. Some public library systems have spent millions upon millions of dollars to make their collections accessible to the community. And I believe the CDL structure preserves that value by enhancing access of these works to the public through technology. And as Chris pointed out, it&#8217;s the same technology that&#8217;s used by publishers to distribute in the commercial marketplace.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, this may be about the fear of technology, certainly, but technology should be used to enhance access to materials and do what libraries have always done: increasing access to knowledge by loaning the materials to the public. Just because we&#8217;re using technology does not mean that suddenly these acts are new. And in fact, libraries have special authority to provide both access longterm to information and preserve these materials for much longer than the business model of any particular corporation, company, or vendor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this is especially true with the 20th Century works that are in libraries, right? They have not been available in the digital world across the board. They call this &#8220;The 20th Century Black Hole.&#8221; Many 20th Century books are not available for purchase as new copies or in print or digital versions online. And I don&#8217;t know if your students are like mine or anyone else or patrons: <em>if it&#8217;s not digital, it&#8217;s almost like it doesn&#8217;t exist.</em> Libraries would like to provide digital access, but we can&#8217;t, because these are not available in a licensed format or in a digital format that&#8217;s available to loan, but we have them on our shelves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So as many of our student patrons say, &#8220;We want access to these works,&#8221; and these could be long lost print works, by the way, that are really not lost; they&#8217;re on the shelves of our libraries, just trapped there, and in COVID maybe trapped there for a longer time than anticipated. So imagine the potentially enormous high social and scholarly value and relatively low risk if we make these works available to the public for reading, quoting, citing, adaption, using Wikipedia articles. So that&#8217;s kind of the exciting aspect of it. I&#8217;m not going to get into great detail, but our principle argument in this paper, which summarizes all these points, is that Controlled Digital Lending is a fair use, which is an equitable rule of reason, that permits libraries to do what they&#8217;ve always done.
