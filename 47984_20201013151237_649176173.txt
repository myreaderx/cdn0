Review the list, choose the top five, and create a definition for each.</li>\n<li><strong>What do you believe?</strong><br />\nList the top five things you know for sure about your life, yourself and your career.</li>\n<li><strong>Why do you believe them?</strong><br />\nDescribe the life experiences that have shaped your values and beliefs.</li>\n<li><strong>Whom do you care deeply about serving?<br />\n</strong>Who are the people you want to impact?<br />\nWhy are they important to you?<br />\nWhat will happen in their lives as a result of your support?</li>\n<li><strong>Which problems do you want to solve?</strong><br />\nWhat do you want to fix?<br />\nWhat could be made better in the world with your help?</li>\n<li><strong>What drives you to act?</strong><br />\nWhich thoughts, feelings, circumstances or beliefs drive you to act?</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Now that you have this information, look at your current work situation.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Are you in a role where you can act according to your values and beliefs?</li>\n<li>Are you serving those who you care most about serving?</li>\n<li>Are you making an impact on problems and issues you want to solve?</li>\n<li>Are you set up for success, so you have the support you need to take action?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If so, keep at it! Build on this success, and go deeper and stronger in your work next year.</p>\n<p>If not, look at changes you can make to get yourself in alignment with your values, up to and including changing jobs, changing your business model, or getting new partners.</p>\n<p>Life is too short to trade your well-being for a paycheck. Take action.</p>\n<p>&#8212;</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.escapefromcubiclenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/BODYofWORKsoft.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-8568\" alt=\"BODYofWORKsoft\" src=\"http://www.escapefromcubiclenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/BODYofWORKsoft-131x200.png\" width=\"73\" height=\"112\" srcset=\"http://www.escapefromcubiclenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/BODYofWORKsoft-131x200.png 131w, http://www.escapefromcubiclenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/BODYofWORKsoft-197x300.png 197w, http://www.escapefromcubiclenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/BODYofWORKsoft-672x1024.png 672w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 73px) 100vw, 73px\" /></a>Want to learn more about creating work-values alignment?
