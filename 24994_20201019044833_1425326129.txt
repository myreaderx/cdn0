A few seconds of warning can make a difference in giving you time to drop, cover, and hold on before the shaking arrives.</p><hr/><p>Related: <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/android/five-new-android-features--/\"><b>5 new things your Android phone can do</b></a></p><hr/></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \"><img alt=\"Asset1_nocaptions (1).gif\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Asset1_nocaptions_1.gif\"/></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>Building the world’s largest earthquake detection network </h3><p>Installing a ground network of seismometers, as California has done, may not be feasible in all impacted areas around the world. So we’re using the reach of Android’s platform to help detect earthquakes.  </p><p>Starting today, your Android phone can be part of the Android Earthquake Alerts System, wherever you live in the world. This means your Android phone can be a mini seismometer, joining millions of other Android phones out there to form the world’s largest earthquake detection network. </p><p>All smartphones come with tiny accelerometers that can sense signals that indicate an earthquake might be happening. If the phone detects something that it thinks may be an earthquake, it sends a signal to our earthquake detection server, along with a coarse location of where the shaking occurred. The server then combines information from many phones to figure out if an earthquake is happening. We’re essentially racing the speed of light (which is roughly the speed at which signals from a phone travel) against the speed of an earthquake. And lucky for us, the speed of light is much faster! </p><p>To start, we’ll use this technology to share a fast, accurate view of the impacted area on Google Search. When you look up “earthquake” or “earthquake near me,” you’ll find relevant results for your area, along with helpful resources on what to do after an earthquake. </p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \"><img alt=\"Asset3_nocaption (1).gif\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Asset3_nocaption_1.gif\"/></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>We’ve worked with globally-renowned seismology and disaster experts <a href=\"https://rallen.berkeley.edu/\">Dr. Richard Allen</a>, <a href=\"http://seismo.berkeley.edu/qingkaikong/\">Dr. Qingkai Kong</a> and <a href=\"http://drlucyjones.com/\">Dr. Lucy Jones</a> to develop this crowdsourced approach for detecting earthquakes all around the world.</p><p>You might be wondering, “what’s next?” We’re starting with earthquake alerts in California since there’s already a great seismometer-based system in place.
