It didn’t help that world events had us all doomscrolling for hours on end. But we know here at Pocket that through it all, you still saved countless hidden gems in your own Pocket. Our <a href=\"https://getpocket.com/explore/best-of-2020\">Best of 2020</a> was proof of all the thoughtful saving and reading we did together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This helped us prioritize the improvements we&#8217;re thrilled to share with you today.
