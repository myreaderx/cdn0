Here, nearly-programmable control of a beam’s group velocity results in alternating acceleration and deceleration regimes in a single propagation path.<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/commsphys/rss/current/~4/AI2rxJ2hiUE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 13 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":49439,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"7f09c3658452257293ae3fdcf627d668","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Zhaoyang Li","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/commsphys/rss/current/~4/AI2rxJ2hiUE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn54@2020_2/2020/11/15/23-32-38-288_ff4f537a1fdab186.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605483125969}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-11-16 07:32:05","updatedTime":"2020-11-16 07:32:05","feedId":49439,"fetchDate":"Sun, 15 Nov 2020 23:32:05 +0000","fetchMs":33,"handleMs":1701,"totalMs":34860,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":8,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"af469a76bfadba3f2d5c459afcf6b6e9","hostName":"us-036*","requestId":"a9c5544e00ec41f68b7b1d36973f5ecf_49439","contentType":"text/xml; charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":72,"bgimgsTotal":0,"bgimgsGithubTotal":0,"articlesImgsTotal":1,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":1,"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx30":1},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-09-07 03:52:52","updatedTime":"2020-09-07 03:52:52","id":49439,"name":"Communications Physics - nature.com science feeds","url":"http://feeds.nature.com/commsphys/rss/current","subscriber":64,"website":null,"icon":"http://feeds.nature.com/static/images/favicons/nature/favicon.62367f778b.ico","icon_jsdelivr":null,"description":"Communications Physics is an open access journal from Nature Research publishing high-quality research, reviews and commentary in all areas of physics.
