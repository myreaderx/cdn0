The push toward affordable 5G devices is clearly as much an indicator as the current state of the smartphone space as anything — people just aren’t upgrading devices as quickly as the used to. And even more to the point, they’re reluctant to pay $1,000 when they do.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 765G has been a piece of that puzzle. And unsurprisingly, the mid-tier chip in found in TCL’s new $400 5G handset. Of course, TCL is positioning it as “under-$400” with that $399.99 price tag, which is technically correct — the best kind of correct.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"b2tzh3Gz8Z\"><p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/21/nord-is-onepluss-sub-500-5g-handset/\">Nord is OnePlus&#8217;s sub-$500 5G handset</a></p></blockquote><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Nord is OnePlus&#8217;s sub-$500 5G handset&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/21/nord-is-onepluss-sub-500-5g-handset/embed/#?secret=b2tzh3Gz8Z\" data-secret=\"b2tzh3Gz8Z\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p class=\"p1\">It’s also not really right to say that the TCL 10 5G UW’s a”premium blend of performance, power, stylish design and 5G connectivity that until now has only been available on more expensive flagship smartphones.” Affordable 5G handsets isn&#8217;t an entirely new phenomenon &#8212; nor are affordable 5G handsets with decent specs and design. But even so, the price point is still notable at this stage in the 5G upgrade cycle — which, frankly, is why we’re writing about it here.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The price/5G combo is the main thing to like here, coming in at even less than, say, the OnePlus Nord, a recent high water mark in the 5G/price point combo. And there are a few other things that should appeal to potential buyers, as well, including a 4,500mAh battery coupled with reverse charging for other devices. There are three rear-facing cameras: a 48-megapixel main, an eight-megapixel ultra wide and a five-megapixel macro, the latter of of which is starting to appear on more phones.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It arrives October 29, and is, notably, a Verizon (TechCrunch’s parent company) exclusive here in the U.S., using the carrier’s mmWave technology.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"vOkmc3ABWg\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/16/verizons-5g-comes-to-parts-of-los-angeles/\">Verizon’s 5G comes to (parts of) Los Angeles</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Verizon’s 5G comes to (parts of) Los Angeles&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/16/verizons-5g-comes-to-parts-of-los-angeles/embed/#?secret=vOkmc3ABWg\" data-secret=\"vOkmc3ABWg\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=j2PvFyuYrIc:CZc6A48InQw:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=j2PvFyuYrIc:CZc6A48InQw:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=j2PvFyuYrIc:CZc6A48InQw:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=j2PvFyuYrIc:CZc6A48InQw:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=j2PvFyuYrIc:CZc6A48InQw:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=j2PvFyuYrIc:CZc6A48InQw:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=j2PvFyuYrIc:CZc6A48InQw:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=j2PvFyuYrIc:CZc6A48InQw:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/j2PvFyuYrIc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 27 Oct 2020 14:25:21 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"c37a136dfd8113605c1f4af4083c788e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn36@2020_3/2020/10/27/16-53-36-082_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Brian Heater","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn36@2020_3/2020/10/27/16-53-36-082_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn80@2020_2/2020/10/27/16-54-15-668_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn32@2020_5/2020/10/27/16-54-14-449_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=j2PvFyuYrIc:CZc6A48InQw:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn68@2020_5/2020/10/27/16-54-15-580_f035a6a6de639a64.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=j2PvFyuYrIc:CZc6A48InQw:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn9@2020_6/2020/10/27/16-54-14-892_aa589d1fc4a04f65.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn14@2020_2/2020/10/27/16-54-15-676_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/j2PvFyuYrIc":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn6@2020_4/2020/10/27/16-54-15-745_35bdb2c46293bc2d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603817615701},{"createdTime":"2020-10-28 00:53:35","updatedTime":"2020-10-28 00:53:35","title":"Lightyear scores $3.7M seed to digitize networking infrastructure procurement","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2066083","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a href=\"http://lightyear.ai\">Lightyear</a>, a New York City startup that wants to make it easier for large companies to procure networking infrastructure like internet and SD-WAN, announced a $3.7 million seed round today.</p>\n<p><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/amplo\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"amplo\">Amplo <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> led the round with help from Susa Ventures, Ludlow Ventures, Mark Cuban, David Adelman and Operator Partners. While it was at it, the company announced that it was emerging from stealth and offering its solution in public beta.</p>\n<p>Company CEO and co-founder Dennis Thankachan says that while so much technology buying has moved online, networking technology procurement still involves phone calls for price quotes that could sometimes take weeks to get. Thankachan says that when he was working at a hedge fund specializing in telecommunications he witnessed this first hand and saw an opportunity for a startup to fill the void.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>&#8220;Our objective is to make the process of buying telecom infrastructure, kind of like buying socks on Amazon, providing a real consumer-like experience to the enterprise and empowering buyers with data because information asymmetry and a lack of transparent data on what things should cost, where providers are available, and even what&#8217;s existing already in your network is really at the core of the problem for why this is frustrating for enterprise buyers,&#8221; Thankachan explained.</p>\n<p>The company offers the ability to simply select a service and find providers in your area with costs and contract terms if it&#8217;s a simple purchase, but he recognizes that not all enterprise purchases will be that simple and the startup is working to digitize the corporate buying process into the <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/lightyear\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"lightyear\">Lightyear <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> platform.</p>\n<p>To provide the data that he spoke of, the company has already formed relationships with over 400 networking providers worldwide. The pricing model is in flux, but could involve a monthly subscription or a percentage of the sale. That is something they are working out, but they are using the latter during beta testing to keep the product free for now.</p>\n<p>The company already has 10 employees and flush with the new investment, it plans to double that in the next year. Thankachan says as he builds the company, particularly as a person of color himself, he takes diversity and inclusion extremely seriously and sees it as part of the company&#8217;s core values.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Trying to enable people from non-traditional backgrounds to succeed will be really important to us, and I think providing economic opportunity to people that traditionally would not have been afforded several aspects of economic opportunity is the biggest ways to fix the opportunity gap in this country,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>The company, which launched a year ago has basically grown up during the pandemic. That means he has yet to meet any of his customers or investors in person, but he says he has learned to adapt to that approach. While he is based in NYC, his investors are are in the Bay Area and so that remote approach will remain in place for the time being.</p>\n<p>As he makes his way from seed to a Series A, he says that it&#8217;s up to him to stay focused and execute with the goal of showing product-market fit across a variety of company types. He believes if the startup can do this, it will have the data to take to investors when it&#8217;s time to take the next step.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=u4juFowivrc:EudeZcBNAFA:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=u4juFowivrc:EudeZcBNAFA:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=u4juFowivrc:EudeZcBNAFA:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=u4juFowivrc:EudeZcBNAFA:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=u4juFowivrc:EudeZcBNAFA:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=u4juFowivrc:EudeZcBNAFA:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=u4juFowivrc:EudeZcBNAFA:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=u4juFowivrc:EudeZcBNAFA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/u4juFowivrc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 27 Oct 2020 14:00:43 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"34fa1a08fac8da472e9c071cbf0ed95d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn36@2020_3/2020/10/27/16-53-36-082_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Ron Miller","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn36@2020_3/2020/10/27/16-53-36-082_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn80@2020_2/2020/10/27/16-54-15-668_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn32@2020_5/2020/10/27/16-54-14-449_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=u4juFowivrc:EudeZcBNAFA:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn79@2020_1/2020/10/27/16-54-14-813_3e552c4c07805815.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=u4juFowivrc:EudeZcBNAFA:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn35@2020_3/2020/10/27/16-54-14-617_1c014587cb64bd99.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn14@2020_2/2020/10/27/16-54-15-676_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/u4juFowivrc":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn7@2020_3/2020/10/27/16-54-14-425_bd3f743c3e06ff58.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603817615693},{"createdTime":"2020-10-28 00:53:35","updatedTime":"2020-10-28 00:53:35","title":"Discuss portfolio management and great storytelling with GV’s M.G.

Siegler <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a>. As a general partner at GV, he&#8217;s personally invested in his fair share of rocket ship companies early on in their lifecycles, including Anchor, Slack, Medium and Stripe. He&#8217;s also a TechCrunch alum and a former startup operator himself as a web dev. We&#8217;re thrilled to have Siegler joining us to talk about his investment experience and how his early career as a writer influenced his thinking about startup success on <strong><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/16/announcing-the-extra-crunch-live-event-series/\">Extra Crunch Live</a> on today live at 2 p.m. EDT/11 a.m. PDT.</strong></p>\n<p>Siegler&#8217;s career in startups began in 2005, working in web development at a startup agency focused on tech clients. He later reported on startups at both VentureBeat and later TechCrunch, before becoming a founded partner at CrunchFund and then eventually joining GV (then Google Ventures) to focus on early-stage companies. In addition to the companies listed above, Siegler has led investments in other successful early-stage companies including Universe, Giphy, The Players&#8217; Tribune, CTRL-Labs and AltspaceVR.</p>\n<p>At the outset of the current global pandemic, Siegler chatted with our own Lucas Matney about GV&#8217;s investment in mobile website-builder Universe and about how managing a portfolio changes in light of travel and social distancing restrictions. We&#8217;ll find out from Siegler what the ensuing months of living and working in the context of COVID-19 have changed about his perspective and about the early-stage companies he&#8217;s working with and scouting for potential investment.</p>\n<p>More broadly, Siegler also has a unique perspective and ample experience when it comes to early-stage startups and storytelling. His work as a journalist focused specifically on looking at new and emerging technology companies and assessing their ability to communicate their ambitions, the problems they&#8217;re solving and the technology they&#8217;re building. He brings that experience to his assessment of the investment potential of startups and their founders, and their ability to tell good and compelling stories about what they&#8217;re doing and why.</p>\n<p>All these topics, plus more questions from you, our audience.

Meanwhile, the emails to potential testers that <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/27/spacex-starlink-service-priced-at-99-a-month-public-beta-test-begins.html\">CNBC obtained</a> detail what users can expect in terms of pricing, speeds and latency.</p>\n<p>The initial Starlink public beta test is called the &#8220;Better than Nothing Beta Program,&#8221; SpaceX confirms in their app description, and will be rolled out across the U.S. and <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/canada-c0c7\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"canada-c0c7\">Canada <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> before the end of the year – which matches up with earlier stated timelines. As per the name, SpaceX is hoping to set expectations for early customers, with speeds users can expect ranging from between 50Mb/s to 150Mb/s, and latency of 20ms to 40ms according to the customer emails, with some periods including no connectivity at all. Even with expectations set low, if those values prove accurate, it should be a big improvement for users in some hard-to-reach areas where service is currently costly, unreliable and operating at roughly dial-up equivalent speeds.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2066317\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2066317\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2066317\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Starlink-UT.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"575\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Starlink-UT.jpg 1390w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Starlink-UT.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Starlink-UT.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Starlink-UT.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Starlink-UT.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Starlink-UT.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2066317\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> SpaceX</p></div></p>\n<p>In terms of pricing, SpaceX says in the emails that the cost for participants in this beta program will be $99 per moth, plus a one-time cost of $499 initially to pay for the hardware, which includes the mounting kit and receiver dish, as well as a router with wifi networking capabilities.</p>\n<p>The goal eventually is offer reliably, low-latency broadband that provides consistent connection by handing off connectivity between a large constellation of small satellites circling the globe in low Earth orbit.

We continue to monitor the satellites in the following hours and days as they disperse and begin their orbit raising sequences.</p></blockquote><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>The actual operational partnership has been active since March of this year, which means that LeoLabs has been tracking these deployments for a number of missions thus far. It&#8217;s also going to continue to do this for future launches going forward. Through their platform, SpaceX gets timely data on Starlink satellites and their orbits just a few hours post-launch, and the startup says it can typically deliver data within one hour of a Starlink satellite passing over one of its radar stations.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2066201\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2066201\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2066201\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1iVpIxiR90-9OcKt4ohtwPg.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"373\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2066201\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> LeoLabs</p></div></p>\n<p>LeoLabs has made headlines recently tracking potential collisions among objects in low Earth orbit, including most recently a near-collision with an 11-meter miss of two objects earlier this month. As low Earth orbit becomes more crowded – in no small part due to SpaceX&#8217;s planned massive increase in its Starlink fleet size – the company&#8217;s services are likely to only grow in demand in order to help with effective space traffic control.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=XJOpNkTJDiw:2ixZLnx82rs:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=XJOpNkTJDiw:2ixZLnx82rs:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=XJOpNkTJDiw:2ixZLnx82rs:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=XJOpNkTJDiw:2ixZLnx82rs:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=XJOpNkTJDiw:2ixZLnx82rs:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=XJOpNkTJDiw:2ixZLnx82rs:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=XJOpNkTJDiw:2ixZLnx82rs:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=XJOpNkTJDiw:2ixZLnx82rs:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/XJOpNkTJDiw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 27 Oct 2020 14:55:06 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1iVpIxiR90-9OcKt4ohtwPg.gif","linkMd5":"96158904834117cf33dc033fd9cb26b8","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn20@2020_1/2020/10/27/16-53-44-317_c418204f3d66733e.webp","destWidth":600,"destHeight":373,"sourceBytes":21003090,"destBytes":1284002,"author":"Darrell Etherington","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1iVpIxiR90-9OcKt4ohtwPg.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn20@2020_1/2020/10/27/16-53-44-317_c418204f3d66733e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn36@2020_3/2020/10/27/16-53-36-082_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn80@2020_2/2020/10/27/16-54-15-668_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn32@2020_5/2020/10/27/16-54-14-449_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=XJOpNkTJDiw:2ixZLnx82rs:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn79@2020_1/2020/10/27/16-54-14-477_5a611bafb93e8221.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=XJOpNkTJDiw:2ixZLnx82rs:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn48@2020_5/2020/10/27/16-54-15-615_c7c2428f345755a8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn14@2020_2/2020/10/27/16-54-15-676_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/XJOpNkTJDiw":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn52@2020_1/2020/10/27/16-54-15-527_26d5e2d613a8cbe6.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603817615709},{"createdTime":"2020-10-28 00:53:35","updatedTime":"2020-10-28 00:53:35","title":"10 favorite startups from Techstars’ October 2020 class","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2065818","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">A few weeks back, The Exchange <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/05/five-favorite-techstars-startups-ahead-of-its-next-rush-of-demo-days/\">dug through a number of Techstars demo days</a> and parsed a few dozen startups to find a few favorites.

It&#8217;s one of those things that when you feel it working, you immediately start thinking about how it could be used.</p>\n<p>What it does is allow not just precision vibration but actual resistance to be added to the triggers, something that sounds vague in theory but is very easy to grasp, so to speak, in practice.</p>\n<p>For instance, in the setup process for Astro&#8217;s Playroom the feature is introduced by simply asking you to pull the triggers and feel it. You&#8217;ll certainly have pulled them before that, so you know that they&#8217;re nearly frictionless normally. But suddenly they&#8217;re pushing back against your finger — then a click, and the resistance is gone.</p>\n<p>&#8220;What is this sorcery?&#8221; I recall saying out loud at the time, or something like it but more profane. It really is that immediately compelling.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2065846\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/astros-playroom.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2065846\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2065846\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/astros-playroom.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/astros-playroom.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/astros-playroom.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/astros-playroom.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/astros-playroom.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/astros-playroom.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/astros-playroom.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/astros-playroom.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2065846\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Sony</p></div></p>\n<p>Later, in the first stage I tried of the game, your little robot jumps into a sort of spring suit (a metal spring, not a linen two-piece) and you have to pull the trigger to make it jump. The haptics in this case truly give a feel of compressing something (though, having played with springs before, I know they don&#8217;t feel like this), and importantly give you a non-visual, intuitive indicator of how far you&#8217;ve depressed the trigger. My brain was quicker to register how far I&#8217;d pulled it with the combination of sound, haptics and graphics than graphics alone. And because the feeling is localized to the trigger you&#8217;re using, there&#8217;s no confusion with the greater vibrations of the all-purpose rumble system.</p>\n<p>The Switch&#8217;s Joy-Cons have a sort of precision haptics in them, and while the demo of that feature was interesting — feeling little objects rattle around &#8220;inside&#8221; the controller — it&#8217;s actually quite hard to think of ways it could be used in gameplay. And indeed few games have done so, though to be fair rumble in general is probably better because of it.</p>\n<p>In the DualSense&#8217;s case, I was immediately thinking, &#8220;this would be great for&#8230;&#8221; and wishing I&#8217;d had it in this or that game in the past. It opens up possibilities I&#8217;ve never liked the idea of, like &#8220;pull the trigger halfway to do one thing, all the way to do another. It&#8217;s also potentially a great accessibility feature.</p>\n<p>Having a speaker and microphone in the controller is nothing new, though they appear to have been upgraded for the DualSense. Few games have been able to use these features properly, and Astro&#8217;s Playroom resorts to the old &#8220;blow on the controller to make a propeller go&#8221; thing. I can&#8217;t imagine anyone wanting to do that in any real game — but why can&#8217;t I yell &#8220;Go, cyberdog! Attack the monster on the right&#8221; to direct my (sadly fictitious) companion, or something like that?</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"M9eGJlCKxO\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/16/sonys-playstation-5-arrives-november-12-priced-at-500/\">Sony&#8217;s PlayStation 5 arrives November 12, priced at $500</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Sony&#8217;s PlayStation 5 arrives November 12, priced at $500&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/16/sonys-playstation-5-arrives-november-12-priced-at-500/embed/#?secret=M9eGJlCKxO\" data-secret=\"M9eGJlCKxO\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>Unfortunately that gets to the heart of what makes even the excellent haptic feature a potentially lost cause. Developers need to design for them in a big way, and that&#8217;s difficult when you can&#8217;t guarantee that people will want or be able to use them. Not only that, but if you want to release on Xbox and PC too, you have to remove them. So they become optional features&#8230; and since they&#8217;re optional, they can&#8217;t be integrated into the game as deeply to begin with, making them less compelling overall. It&#8217;s happened over and over with various innovations gaming companies have come up with over the years, and it may happen with this generation&#8217;s gimmicks as well.</p>\n<p>Sony&#8217;s best bet is to make integration painless and highly incentivized, though it&#8217;s hard to imagine how multi-platform developers like Ubisoft can do much more than the minimum. Serious use will likely be limited to a handful of top-shelf Sony-funded PS5 exclusives that players will marvel at.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s an interesting new gameplay feature, but hardly one that screams &#8220;next-generation.&#8221; Indeed little about the next consoles from Sony or Microsoft screams that except the specs. That doesn&#8217;t mean they aren&#8217;t worth buying — but don&#8217;t expect anything transformative.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=18URJ5Gwges:IvP3D_P-1PE:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=18URJ5Gwges:IvP3D_P-1PE:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=18URJ5Gwges:IvP3D_P-1PE:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=18URJ5Gwges:IvP3D_P-1PE:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=18URJ5Gwges:IvP3D_P-1PE:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=18URJ5Gwges:IvP3D_P-1PE:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=18URJ5Gwges:IvP3D_P-1PE:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=18URJ5Gwges:IvP3D_P-1PE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/18URJ5Gwges\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 27 Oct 2020 16:31:54 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/dualsense-hero.jpg","linkMd5":"3a63d9c658b639d000766225a9a1aff2","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn43@2020_2/2020/10/27/16-53-36-418_38b5abcfe7f737ea.webp","destWidth":2500,"destHeight":1609,"sourceBytes":625005,"destBytes":89878,"author":"Devin Coldewey","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/dualsense-hero.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn43@2020_2/2020/10/27/16-53-36-418_38b5abcfe7f737ea.webp","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/astros-playroom.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn84@2020_1/2020/10/27/16-54-14-720_0ae6d19b6f94aaa0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn36@2020_3/2020/10/27/16-53-36-082_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn80@2020_2/2020/10/27/16-54-15-668_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn32@2020_5/2020/10/27/16-54-14-449_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=18URJ5Gwges:IvP3D_P-1PE:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn57@2020_2/2020/10/27/16-54-14-440_127360db1da3f5e2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=18URJ5Gwges:IvP3D_P-1PE:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn9@2020_1/2020/10/27/16-54-15-755_ff0f8b6c2a2df678.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn14@2020_2/2020/10/27/16-54-15-676_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/18URJ5Gwges":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn75@2020_2/2020/10/27/16-54-15-617_7de2aac103648a15.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603817615699},{"createdTime":"2020-10-28 00:53:35","updatedTime":"2020-10-28 00:53:35","title":"Panoply raises $10M for its cloud data platform","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2065879","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a href=\"https://panoply.io/\">Panoply</a>, a platform that makes it easier for businesses to set up a data warehouse and analyze that data with standard SQL queries, today announced that it has raised an additional $10 million in funding from Ibex Investors and C5 Capital.

Over the last few years, it also built more <a href=\"https://panoply.io/integrations/\">code-free data integrations</a> into the platform that make it easier for businesses to pull in data from a wide variety of sources, including the likes of Salesforce, HubSpot, NetSuite, Xero, Quickbooks, Freshworks and others.

But every once in a while I get to mess with a new piece of kit that is just so fully realized that I am literally shocked. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Backbone One controller is one of those situations. It’s a game controller for iPhones that has slick ergonomics, solid button feel, sensitive analog triggers and great build quality. But what makes Backbone One special is the companion app and service that ships with it and enables a truly clever software layer enabling cross-app multiplayer, game recording, highlight editing and quick swap. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Designers from Ideo and Astro Studios helped realize Backbone and the pedigree of people who have crafted devices like the Xbox 360 controller really show here. Wide L1/R1 buttons make it easy to tap on mobile. Analog L2/R2 triggers feel deep but tight. The latest Lightning connector standard means extremely low latency for control signals. </span></p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The controller is around 7” long in its compact state and uses a clever sliding mechanism to expand outwards to up to 10” in size. It easily fits Apple’s “Plus” sized phones and when you’re using one of those it feels like a full on game console for the first time I can remember.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are acoustic tunneling scoops at the inside edges that direct sound forward from the phone speakers and there is work being done behind the scenes to cancel out the specific sounds the Backbone One’s buttons make so that you don’t hear those while you’re playing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But it’s the software that makes Backbone One really special.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To co-opt a biblical phrase, hardware without software is dead. And the Backbone One is really, really alive.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Behind the Backbone One is Backbone itself, which is a ‘companion app’ but is really a live gaming service. It has integrated cross-game voice chat, game switching, parties and a friends list. It lets you get push notifications when your friends are on and slide right into a game with them with a single tap. It’s remarkably slick and feels as first-party as you could make something that is literally not first-party feel.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Backbone was founded by Maneet Khaira in the summer of 2018 while interning at YouTube and wrapping up at Columbia. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Khaira notes that one of the biggest issues in mobile gaming is that there is a ton of activation energy when it comes to jumping in and playing with friends. The major games are there: Call of Duty, Fortnite (eventually, again), PUBG &#8212; but the last mile issue is major. </span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2066273\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_0276.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_0276.jpg 4032w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_0276.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_0276.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_0276.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_0276.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_0276.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_0276.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_0276.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Khaira points out that while there are plenty of examples of top-tier gaming titles on iPhone, there is just a desert of content created on these platforms available to watch on Twitch or YouTube. He likens it to a hysteresis &#8212; a lagging behind of an effect from its cause. There are </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">so many</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> mobile gamers that there should be a </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ton</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of mobile content shared, but because the mechanisms to do so have been so poor and so under-crafted, we have next to nothing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Backbone changes that completely. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are the basic pillars of Backbone:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gameplay has to feel good. The Backbone controller had to be best-in-class hardware.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Content creation. It had to be easy and seamless to capture highlights, clips and footage and share them to your preferred platform. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Playing with friends has to be instantaneous. Backbone uses notifications about when friends start playing across any game and you can do so from one central friends list. </span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because Backbone is a support app, it gets a bunch of special privileges that would normally not be granted to a ‘regular’ class of app. Backbone One is always on while it’s attached, which means that the app can do whatever it needs to do no matter what app you’re in or for how long. This is huge because it enables the Backbone button on the controller to add games to your dashboard, swap easily between them and lets you get at your friends list contained in Backbone.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The stopwatch time for attaching the Backbone One to your phone and beginning to play a game in multiplayer is measured in seconds, not minutes. It’s exactly what you need in the mobile context.</span></p>\n<p>[gallery ids=\"2066280,2066277,2066262,2066265,2066258,2066259\"]</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It also enables any-time recording of clips and highlights that store locally on your device but can be uploaded anywhere at 1080p/30fps HEVC. When you’re in game you can just smash the Capture button to start recording and tap it to screenshot. The Backbone app also has some ML work going on to identify highlight-worthy clips and mark them automatically. You can also tag them yourself while you play.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And Backbone One does this on less power than the crap earbuds that (used to) come in an iPhone box. You won’t notice any major power drain from the accessory itself. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If Backbone can manage to get a partnership with one or two majors to have a built-in control scheme that takes advantage of the proper dead zones and timing it could be a real watershed moment for mobile gaming. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But right now it works with </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">most</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> games that have controller support right out of the box. No game needs to do anything special to take advantage of the majority of Backbone features. This basically adds on a layer of inter-game social and clip sharing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s all of the basic features of Game Center, Twitch, PSN and Xbox Live rolled into one &#8212; but on iPhone. And, of course, the BackBone one works just fine with Xbox and PlayStation remote play apps.</span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2066294\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-27-at-9.00.51-AM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"419\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-27-at-9.00.51-AM.png 5766w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-27-at-9.00.51-AM.png?resize=150,61 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-27-at-9.00.51-AM.png?resize=300,123 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-27-at-9.00.51-AM.png?resize=768,315 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-27-at-9.00.51-AM.png?resize=680,279 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-27-at-9.00.51-AM.png?resize=1536,629 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-27-at-9.00.51-AM.png?resize=2048,839 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-27-at-9.00.51-AM.png?resize=50,20 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes a list of investors can tell you a lot about how serious a company is about getting the right kind of money. For a company building a gaming service and peripheral hardware, Backbone couldn’t have a more solid column. Backbone is backed by MrBeast, Preston, Kwebbelkop, Typical Gamer, Night Media, Nadeshot, and Ludlow Ventures, as well as Ashton Kutcher and Guy Oseary’s Sound Ventures. Pretty much exactly the profile I would want to see for a company serious about social and mobile gaming. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In many ways, Backbone feels like a spiritual successor to <a href=\"http://www.openfeint.com/?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=3568b04772e91c33271d8c62b8f6753062efd764-1602291618-0-AQ3hlLqj7ObQTsCxKRMNjIBbP01TwQSTluv7I9LZksLLSfBld8wdYQAIw1a_RCr2KtgBK7m4_0Hkmd_7WS6BOso5WZgTaQUYJW6-H6h6E-TWNKT6jQg8TU7M3NcVi4CJZJe9FhUp1nbiVxUHucVrQoNveUwy5gNVgZC0UeJfgYw9Qs1wlsQPWZI8Y7gw9ErRU6LMgm-jCQw5dxEu5ev9csLYirjwkJt-aokiedcm8fJ4PIZvCAV19I47Bl5PgNHmqDX5yvUqxghGUWg0VI-nWg0\">OpenFeint</a>. If you’re not familiar, OpenFeint was the first modern mobile gaming network. It launched the year after the iPhone App Store and was part of a game called Aurora Feint. It enabled multiplayer, scoreboards and messaging. The founder of OpenFeint? Jason Citron. Jason’s current startup, that also shares a lot of spiritual luggage with OpenFeint? Discord.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s hard to overstate how important OpenFeint was at the time. As the app ecosystem was emerging it was clear that games would be a big part of what made the iPhone successful and this was the first cross-game network that allowed people to take advantage of one of the first phones to have a persistent, high-quality (ish) internet connection. Apple launched Game Center as a basic response to this need but it has never put any real investment behind it since. Backbone is so good that I could actually see Apple hauling out the repo and assigning engineering talent to get it working well again. The time has come for this idea and Backbone’s execution is so top notch here that it makes the case open and shut.</span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2066293\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-27-at-9.01.12-AM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"461\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-27-at-9.01.12-AM.png 4780w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-27-at-9.01.12-AM.png?resize=150,67 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-27-at-9.01.12-AM.png?resize=300,135 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-27-at-9.01.12-AM.png?resize=768,345 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-27-at-9.01.12-AM.png?resize=680,306 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-27-at-9.01.12-AM.png?resize=1536,691 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-27-at-9.01.12-AM.png?resize=2048,921 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-27-at-9.01.12-AM.png?resize=50,22 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ve been testing the controller for a few weeks now with a variety of games. I played a quick match of Call of Duty Warzone with Khaira and even though we didn’t secure the dub it was massively more playable than running with touch controls. My very first session of CoD I had a 28 kill game in cod mobile and, even though I was put into a lobby that prioritizes controller users the other players had like 5 kills each. Though you can now pair console controllers to iPhone, the Backbone is so much better than any of the other integrated controllers on the market that it will quickly become a must have for any mobile player that actually wants to be competitive. I have spent as much time with Apple mobile hardware and the people that have created it as probably anyone on the planet so please understand that I don’t say this lightly but this really feels like the game controller and network Apple would have made if it understood competitive games.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Backbone One controller runs $99 and can be </span><a

The firm also expects another $14 trillion to be invested in the energy grid by 2050.</p>\n<p>The rain on this new energy parade could come from India and China, which have long been reliant on coal power to keep their national economies humming. But even in these colossal coal consumers the Bloomberg report sees good news for people who like good news.</p>\n<p>They expect coal-fired power to peak in China in 2027 and in India in 2030. By 2050, coal is projected to account for only 12% of global electricity consumption. But even with the surge in renewables gas-fired power ain&#8217;t dead. It remains the only fossil-fuel to continue to grow until 2050, albeit at an anemic 0.5% per-year.</p>\n<p>No one should break out the champagne based on these projections, though, because the current trajectory still sees the globe on a course to hit a 3.3 degrees Celsius rise in temperature by 2100.</p>\n<p>“The next ten years will be crucial for the energy transition,&#8221; said Bloomberg New Energy Finance chief executive, Jon Moore. &#8220;There are three key things that we will need to see: accelerated deployment of wind and PV; faster consumer uptake in electric vehicles, small-scale renewables, and low-carbon heating technology, such as heat pumps; and scaled-up development and deployment of zero-carbon fuels.&#8221;</p>\n<p>And a three degree rise in temperature is bad. At that temperature huge swaths of the world would be unlivable because of widespread drought, rainfall in Mexico and Central America would decline by about half, Southern Africa could be exposed to a water crisis and large portions of nations would be covered by sand dunes (including chunks of Botswana and a large portion of the Western U.S.). The Rocky Mountains would be snowless and the Colorado River could be reduce to a stream, according to <a href=\"http://www.climatecodered.org/2010/09/what-would-3-degrees-mean.html#:~:text=Three%20degrees%20would%20likely%20see,to%20fall%2050%20per%20central.\">this description in Climate Code Red.</a></p>\n<p>“To stay well below two degrees of global temperature rise, we would need to reduce emissions by 6% every year starting now, and to limit the warming to 1.5 degrees C, emissions would have to fall by 10% per year,&#8221; Matthias Kimmel, a senior analyst and co-author of the latest report, said in a statement.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=6N9jRi2rf98:eQdJZhVCV3g:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=6N9jRi2rf98:eQdJZhVCV3g:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=6N9jRi2rf98:eQdJZhVCV3g:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=6N9jRi2rf98:eQdJZhVCV3g:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=6N9jRi2rf98:eQdJZhVCV3g:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=6N9jRi2rf98:eQdJZhVCV3g:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=6N9jRi2rf98:eQdJZhVCV3g:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=6N9jRi2rf98:eQdJZhVCV3g:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/6N9jRi2rf98\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 27 Oct 2020 14:59:12 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/unnamed-1-1.jpg","linkMd5":"7090d05f501b6869d4077037ac94aff7","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn39@2020_2/2020/10/27/16-54-10-701_3cdc4a14bfc698e1.webp","destWidth":1060,"destHeight":638,"sourceBytes":66993,"destBytes":28508,"author":"Jonathan Shieber","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/unnamed-1-1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn39@2020_2/2020/10/27/16-54-10-701_3cdc4a14bfc698e1.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn36@2020_3/2020/10/27/16-53-36-082_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn80@2020_2/2020/10/27/16-54-15-668_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn32@2020_5/2020/10/27/16-54-14-449_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=6N9jRi2rf98:eQdJZhVCV3g:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn43@2020_3/2020/10/27/16-54-15-463_07e05b8d62077fbb.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=6N9jRi2rf98:eQdJZhVCV3g:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn29@2020_4/2020/10/27/16-54-15-909_d52952300342819e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn14@2020_2/2020/10/27/16-54-15-676_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/6N9jRi2rf98":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn40@2020_6/2020/10/27/16-54-15-462_1d925e7d393ff08b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603817615705},{"createdTime":"2020-10-28 00:53:35","updatedTime":"2020-10-28 00:53:35","title":"Next-gen skincare, silk without spiders and pollution for lunch: Meet the biotech startups pitching at IndieBio’s Demo Day","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2066155","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Biotech can often, and sometimes literally, fly over our heads.

It costs $40/month to use Anima, or approximately $370 annually. Arbel confirmed to TechCrunch that pricing wouldn&#8217;t change with the launch of Anima 4.0 but that it may in the future. The reason for that is that Anima originally took developers out of the picture, allowing designers to build out their designs and translate it automatically into running HTML code.</p>\n<p>With this launch, Anima is looking to bring developers back into the fold, speaking to them in React (their native tongue, if you will). That opens the door to charging more per seat or introducing new revenue streams.</p>\n<p>Arbel said that Anima was profitable before it ever received its first funding, which came in the form of a $120K check from Y Combinator in the summer of 2018. This year, the company raised $2.5 million in seed funding led by Hetz Ventures, Zohar Gilon, and Ed Lando.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"awDaYwazJG\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2015/02/24/notifications-without-apps/\">Yo Tries To Make Itself Useful With Photo And Link Alerts From 150 Sources</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Yo Tries To Make Itself Useful With Photo And Link Alerts From 150 Sources&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2015/02/24/notifications-without-apps/embed/#?secret=awDaYwazJG\" data-secret=\"awDaYwazJG\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>Today, Anima is used by 300,000 designers, developers and product managers from companies like Google, Amazon,  Starbucks, and Walmart, among others.

Rockset supplied a few metrics to illustrate this. For starters, revenue grew 290% in the last quarter.

It&#8217;s just a tool for creation, editing and sharing.</p>\n<p>Using the app, you can either edit an existing filter or create one of your own from scratch.</p>\n<p>The app focuses on realistic photo editing, not using overlays of digital assets to create new styles &#8212; like apps that swap out the background, for example, or those that use AR.</p>\n<p>When your filter is complete, you tap the sharing button which adds a banner to your photo that reads: &#8220;Get this filter,&#8221; and offers download instructions along with a QR code. You then save this image to your iPhone Camera Roll, then post it anywhere you want &#8212; like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat, in an email, in a messaging app, or on your own website.</p>\n<p>When others see the shared image, they save it to their own Camera Roll by taking a screenshot.</p>\n<p>The next time those users open the Filtertune app, it will scan for new filters by looking for images with a QR code. When it finds them, the new filters will be added to the in-app collection.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2066302\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2066302\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2066302\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Filtertune-Results-With-Filter-Tag.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"678\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Filtertune-Results-With-Filter-Tag.png 1284w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Filtertune-Results-With-Filter-Tag.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Filtertune-Results-With-Filter-Tag.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Filtertune-Results-With-Filter-Tag.png?resize=768,766 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Filtertune-Results-With-Filter-Tag.png?resize=680,678 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Filtertune-Results-With-Filter-Tag.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Filtertune-Results-With-Filter-Tag.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Filtertune-Results-With-Filter-Tag.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Filtertune-Results-With-Filter-Tag.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Filtertune-Results-With-Filter-Tag.png?resize=128,128 128w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2066302\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Lightricks</p></div></p>\n<p>Users can then use Filtertune to edit photos with any of the custom filters discovered from across social media.</p>\n<p>It is interesting to see how much Filtertune leans on Instagram to drive discovery here.
