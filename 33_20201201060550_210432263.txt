How Can We Win?","link":"https://kottke.org/20/11/the-pandemic-is-a-marathon-without-a-finish-line-how-can-we-win","description":"<p>With the positive news about the Covid-19 vaccine trials, I assume many of you have started to think about the potential end of the pandemic — what we’ll do, where we’ll go, who we’ll see, and reckon with what’s changed and what’s been lost. I know I have. Alex Hutchinson has <a href=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-covid-19-is-like-running-a-marathon-with-no-finish-line-what-does/\">written an intriguing piece</a> on what sports science might be able to tell us about the psychology of a situation like the pandemic, where the finish line is poorly defined, ever-changing, or even non-existent.</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>As it happens, there’s a whole subfield of sports science, at the intersection of physiology and psychology, that explores this terrain. It’s called teleoanticipation, a term <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8641377/\">coined in 1996</a> by German physiologist Hans-Volkhart Ulmer to describe how our knowledge of an eventual endpoint (or telos) influences the entirety of an experience. Using endurance sports as their medium, researchers in this subfield have probed what happens when you hide the finish line, surreptitiously move it or take it away entirely. For those of us tempted by promising vaccine updates to start fantasizing about an end to the pandemic, these researchers have some advice: don’t.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>Instead, the key seems to be remaining in the moment instead of focusing on the goal.</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>It turns out that, if you ask yourself “Can I keep going?” rather than “Can I make it to the finish?” you’re far more likely to answer in the affirmative.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>This squares with mindfulness practices from Buddhism and Stoicism but also reminds me of a motivational trick I first heard a few years ago: that you can do anything for 10 seconds — and then you just begin a new 10 seconds. Turns out <a href=\"https://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/03/24/kimmy-schmidts-revolutionary-approach-to-pain/\">that was popularized by Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt</a>.

The logistics of getting the doses out to hospitals, clinics, and doctor’s offices is one concern but so is the question of who should get vaccinated first. Supplies of the vaccines will be limited at first, so we’ll need to decide as a society what distribution method is most fair and is of the most benefit to the greatest number of people.</p> \n<p>To this end, and in response to a request by the CDC and NIH, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine formed a committee to produce a report called <a href=\"https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/a-framework-for-equitable-allocation-of-vaccine-for-the-novel-coronavirus\">Framework for Equitable Allocation of COVID-19 Vaccine</a>. The 252-page report <a href=\"https://www.nap.edu/read/25917/chapter/1\">is available to the public for free to read online or download</a>.</p> \n<p>In addition several recommendations — including that the vaccine be distributed to everyone free of charge — a central feature of the report is a four-phase system of vaccine distribution, summarized in this graphic:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://kottke.org/plus/misc/images/equitable-covid-vaccine-distrib.jpg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"635\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Four-phase framework for the equitable allocation of a COVID-19 vaccine\" /></p> \n<p>I’d like to stress that this graphic does not show all groups of people included in each phase — please consult the text of the report for that before you go sharing that graphic on social media without context. For example, here’s the full description for “high-risk health workers” in Phase 1a:</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>This group includes frontline health care workers (who are in hospitals, nursing homes, or providing home care) who either (1) work in situations where the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is higher, or (2) are at an elevated risk of transmitting the infection to patients at higher risk of mortality and severe morbidity. These individuals — who are themselves unable to avoid exposure to the virus — play a critical role in ensuring that the health system can care for COVID-19 patients.</p> \n <p>These groups include not only clinicians (e.g., nurses, physicians, respiratory technicians, dentists and hygienists) but also other workers in health care settings who meet the Phase 1a risk criteria (e.g., nursing assistants, environmental services staff, assisted living facility staff, long-term care facility staff, group home staff, and home caregivers). The health care settings employing these workers who are at increased risk of exposure to the virus may also include ambulatory and urgent care clinics; dialysis centers; blood, organ, and tissue donation facilities; and other non-hospital health care facilities. Finally, there are community and family settings where care for infected patients occurs. Not all the workers in these settings are paid for their labor, but, while they are caring for infected people, they all need to be protected from the virus.</p> \n <p>Situations associated with higher risk of transmission include caring for COVID-19 patients, cleaning areas where COVID-19 patients are admitted, treated, and housed, and performing procedures with higher risk of aerosolization such as endotracheal intubation, bronchoscopy, suctioning, turning the patient to the prone position, disconnecting the patient from the ventilator, invasive dental procedures and exams, invasive specimen collection, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. In addition, there are other frontline health care workers who, if they have uncontrolled exposure to the patients or the public in the course of their work, should be in this initial phase. This group includes those individuals distributing or administering the vaccine — especially in areas of higher community transmission — such as pharmacists, plasma and blood donation workers, public health nurses, and other public health and emergency preparedness workers. The committee also includes morticians, funeral home workers, and other death care professionals involved in handling bodies as part of this high-risk group.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>The report declines to list specific industries which would be covered in Phase 2’s “critical workers in high-risk settings” but generally says:</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>The industries in which these critical workers are employed are essential to keeping society and the economy functioning. Since the beginning of the pandemic, millions of people have been going to work and risking exposure to the virus to ensure that markets have food; drug stores have pharmaceutical products; public safety and order are maintained; mail and packages are delivered; and buses, trains, and planes are operating.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Note also the text at the bottom of the graphic: they recommend that within each phase, priority be given to geographic areas where folks are more socially vulnerable in situations like these (e.g. as represented in <a href=\"https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/placeandhealth/svi/index.html\">the CDC’s Social Vulnerability Index</a>).</p> \n<p>In developing this phased approach, the committee focused on those who are at the most risk of exposure, severe illness or death, and passing along the virus to others as well as critical workers:</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>Risk of acquiring infection: Individuals have higher priority to the extent that they have a greater probability of being in settings where SARS-CoV-2 is circulating and of being exposed to a sufficient dose of the virus.</p> \n <p>Risk of severe morbidity and mortality: Individuals have higher priority to the extent that they have a greater probability of severe disease or death if they acquire infection.</p> \n <p>Risk of negative societal impact: Individuals have higher priority to the extent that societal function and other individuals’ lives and livelihood depend on them directly and would be imperiled if they fell ill.</p> \n <p>Risk of transmitting infection to others: Individuals have higher priority to the extent that there is a higher probability of their transmitting the infection to others.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>You should read (or at least skim) <a href=\"https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/a-framework-for-equitable-allocation-of-vaccine-for-the-novel-coronavirus\">the full report</a> for more information about the plan and the rationale behind it.</p> \n<p>On a personal parting note, as someone who is squarely in the 5-15% of Americans covered in Phase 4 — more specifically: as a 40-something straight white man who non-essentially works from home, isn’t low-income, doesn’t socialize widely even under normal circumstances, and should probably be the very last person on this whole Earth scheduled to be vaccinated under an equitable framework — I am content to wait my turn should the US adopt this framework or something like it.<sup id=\"fnref:1606254799\"><a href=\"https://kottke.org/20/11/a-framework-for-the-equitable-allocation-of-a-covid-19-vaccine#fn:1606254799\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></sup> Distributing vaccines to those who need them most is absolutely the right thing to do, both ethically and from the standpoint of getting society “back to normal” as quickly as possible and with as little additional death and suffering as possible.</p> \n<ol> \n <li class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn:1606254799\"><p>Being that equity often isn’t America’s thing, especially during the pandemic, I could see this going either way.

The legitimate government came back but it was divided and weak. We were divided and weak. We were vulnerable.</p> \n <p>Four months later, on Easter Sunday, some assholes attacked multiple churches and hotels, killing 269 of us. My wife and kids were at church, I had to frantically call them back. Our nation was shattered. Mobs began attacking innocent Muslims. It was out of control. The coup broke our government, and four months later, that broke us.</p> \n <p>The coup was a farce at the time but how soon it turned to tragedy. They called it a constitutional crisis, but how soon it became a real one. Right now, <strong>the same thing is happening to you</strong>. I’m trying to warn you America.

It was released in the United Kingdom on October 1st and should appear in the United States on February 23, 2021. </p> \n<p>Here’s an excerpt from the core of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/oct/04/tom-stoppard-a-life-review-smuggling-heart-into-a-scholars-story\">Kate Kellaway’s glowing review in The Guardian</a>:</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>“He put on Englishness like a coat,” Lee writes - and one imagines a particularly dashing coat because Stoppard compensated for his reserve by being an unretiring dresser (a recent photograph shows him, in his 80s, still modishly draped). But the English coat was possibly over-buttoned. Stoppard had an exile’s gratitude to England. He found his boarding school in 18th-century Okeover Hall “paradise”. Yet Lee qualifies the received idea - an oversimplified, dismissive slur - of Stoppard as unswervingly conservative. For a start, he is too entertaining to be stuffy… </p> \n <p>His championing of political causes is shown to have stemmed more from empathy with individuals than from abstract ideals. His support for Belarus Free Theatre makes particularly fascinating reading, as does the account of his friendship with Václav Havel, Czech playwright and president. Havel is presented as the person Stoppard might have been had he not become an Englishman.</p> \n <p>Lee’s studies of the plays are masterly - especially of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead (1966) and Arcadia (1993) - and her book will be a formidable resource for Stoppard enthusiasts. She makes a persuasive case for the importance of emotion, challenging - even in the early work - the old complaint that Stoppard is all head and no heart. Jumpers is “a sensational exercise in mental acrobatics” but also “a play of grief and love. It carries the sadness and the guilt of living in a malfunctioning marriage with a wife who is having a breakdown and it opened two days after his divorce.”</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>The British edition from Faber &amp; Faber is 992 pages long and weighs 1.33 kilograms (about three pounds). It also retails for £30 in the UK, about 40 USD (used to be more, but the exchange rate has been low—point is, it’s an expensive book). Mercifully, Knopf’s US hardcover will be only 897 pages and cost $37.50, with weight unchanged. </p> \n<p>It’s a big book by a biographer known for big books about major literary figures, sadly mostly dead. Stoppard is very much alive, and although quite private, agreed to sit for hours of interviews over a course of years. Lee was also able to interview Stoppard’s friends and colleagues, including actress Felicity Kendal (who starred in multiple Stoppard plays, including in roles written for her), director Trevor Nunn (in charge of three of Stoppard’s world premieres), and filmmaker Steven Spielberg.</p> \n<p>This last might seem like an odd choice, but Spielberg and Stoppard have multiple points of contact. Stoppard wrote the screenplay for Spielberg’s <em>Empire of the Sun</em>, and served as an uncredited ghostwriter on <em>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</em>. In fact, not only was Stoppard not credited, the lack of credit was actually given to a pseudonym, “Barry Watson.”</p> \n<p>Everything suggests that Stoppard’s contributions to the film were substantial. In a brief oral history of <em>The Last Crusade</em>, now lost to linkrot but <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20080808115836/http://www.empireonline.com/indy/day17/\">still preserved by the Wayback Machine</a>, Spielberg says, “Tom is pretty much responsible for every line of dialogue.” </p> \n<p>Last year, narrative analyst Mike Fitzgerald <a href=\"https://mffilm.wixsite.com/lastcrusade\">broke down in detail</a> differences between a draft version of the screenplay by credited writer Jeffrey Boam and the published draft, including revisions by Spielberg and a heavy rewrite by Stoppard. (You can actually download both versions of the screenplay on Fitzgerald’s site.) Again, Stoppard contributed not just lines of dialogue, but new scenes, a new structure, and changes in characterization. </p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>Vast enhancements were made to every element of the story - character, plot, pace, humor, action, tone, clarity, dialogue. The result is a markedly more coherent, charming, and enduring script that truly belongs in a museum. I suspect that, absent the final revisions, this film would have been regarded by audiences as inferior to its antecedent sequel THE TEMPLE OF DOOM in tone, wit, and entertainment value…</p> \n <p>TIGHTENING: The revised draft is 15 pages shorter, though material was not arbitrarily removed just to cut pages. I found 19 instances of scenes or beats being cut, 6 superfluous characters removed, several jokes deleted, and dialogue often pared down. Each of these extractions had a clear purpose to it, whether streamlining the plot, quickening the pace, avoiding redundancies, or simply that the material in question was superfluous and distracting. Note that the revised draft has also ADDED a substantial amount of new scenes, beats, jokes, and dialogue, so in order to counterbalance the new material and cut 15 pages, an ample sum of script was removed… </p> \n <p>DIALOGUE: One of Stoppard’s most obvious revisions is to vastly refine the dialogue, and only by reading both drafts side by side is it possible to study those differences. I would ballpark that 80% of the lines have been substantially changed.</p> \n <p>HUMOR: This manifests largely in the dialogue, but also in sight gags, character actions, edit points, and streamlining moments to make the jokes land with more precision. The quality of humor is also refined, by removing coarse innuendo and making the jokes smarter and less predictable.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>Stoppard was responsible for reshaping one of my favorite scenes in the film. At one point, Henry (Sean Connery’s character) was going to use Indy’s gun (down to just one bullet) to shoot at the seagulls, who would in turn fly into the engines of the plane pursuing them and make it crash. Stoppard had Henry chase them with his umbrella instead.</p> \n<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/q0vvYHuA10U\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p> \n<p>(The Charlemagne quote is totally made up. Unclear whether Henry Jones is supposed to believe that it’s real.)</p> \n<p>Stoppard emphasized elements of faith and history in the story. For example, he rewrote the character of Kazim, changing him from a Nazi stooge to a protector of the grail, and invented the Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword. </p> \n<p>Stoppard also rewrote Henry’s dialogue during the cavern collapse to have him finally call his son by his chosen name, Indiana.</p> \n<p>One last thing: if you watch <em>The Last Crusade</em> now, as opposed to thirty years ago, certain things stand out. They used a lot of projected backgrounds. Those don’t look great. More substantively, the Nazis, while generally faithful to their portrayal in <em>Raiders of the Lost Ark</em>, plus some updates, feel pretty… thin. They’re bad guys, evil and a little scary, but you’d be forgiven if you came away from the movie thinking the problem with the Nazis was that they liked to burn books and despoil antiquities, while good people love libraries and museums. That ain’t it.</p> \n<p>Stoppard was born Tomás Straüssler, in 1937, in Zlín, Czechoslovakia. In 1939, his parents, nonpracticing Jews, fled the Nazi invasion to Singapore. His father was killed in 1942 when the Japanese Air Force bombed Singapore, and Stoppard has no memory of him; Tom, his mother Marta, and his brother succeeded in reaching India, where he lived until 1946. His new stepfather, Major Kenneth Stoppard, was an antisemite; his mother hid her and her children’s Jewishness to be accepted by him and his circle, now in England.</p> \n<p>Three of Stoppard’s aunts, all four of his grandparents, and his great-grandmother all died in the Holocaust. And Stoppard did not know this about his extended family until 1993, four years after the release of <em>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</em>.</p> \n<p>It is tempting to ask, if Stoppard had been fully aware of and fully embraced his central European and Jewish roots, as he was when he wrote his new play Leopoldstadt, whether his approach to the Nazis, or the very Christian, very English themes of the Grail legend, or even the son striving to be reconciled to his father, might have been substantively different.</p> \n<p>In many ways, the Grail legend was perfect for Stoppard: more English than the English, but still a little resistant, a little outside the nation’s own history. A crusade, a quest, a reclamation, a reconciliation. </p> \n<strong>Tags:</strong> \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/biography\">biography</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Hermione%20Lee\">Hermione Lee</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Indiana%20Jones\">Indiana Jones</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Steven%20Spielberg\">Steven Spielberg</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/theater\">theater</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Tom%20Stoppard\">Tom Stoppard</a>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 21 Nov 2020 13:00:00 +0000","feedId":33,"bgimg":"https://kottke.org/plus/misc/images/Tom%20Stoppard%20-%20Young.jpg","linkMd5":"a1735762d0de936188b93153d45d5233","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn20@2020_3/2020/12/01/06-05-24-813_487e546112c47df7.webp","destWidth":2600,"destHeight":1560,"sourceBytes":285178,"destBytes":285178,"author":"Tim Carmody","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://kottke.org/plus/misc/images/Tom%20Stoppard%20-%20Young.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn20@2020_3/2020/12/01/06-05-24-813_487e546112c47df7.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1606802722597},{"createdTime":"2020-12-01 14:05:22","updatedTime":"2020-12-01 14:05:22","title":"This Village’s Adorable Christmas Lights Are Designed by Kids","link":"https://kottke.org/20/11/this-villages-adorable-christmas-lights-are-designed-by-kids","description":"<p>In the Scottish village of <a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/tpsU2NfYMp9i6JoKA\">Newburgh</a>, the Christmas lights hung up around town were designed from drawings done by local schoolchildren.

This applies to sports, arts, almost everything. It’s worth doing something for a long time, even if the benefits are not always clear. Good surprising things come out of it. You also learn about yourself in the process.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>His inspiration in doing the film was to “inform, delight, and inspire”:</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>I mentioned above Milton Glaser’s “inform and delight” definition of art. It’s brilliant, but I always felt something was still missing from it. So I’d say that art — and any creative’s work — should aim to “inform, delight and inspire”. Hopefully my film will inspire people to start something of their own, or share what they’re already doing with other people. That would bring joy to everyone, and there’s never too much of it.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>You can check out Barbarasa’s cycling cap collection <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/thecyclingcap/\">on Instagram</a>. I have never been much of a collector, but my 22+ years of efforts on this site (collecting knowledge/links?) and my sharing of photos on Flickr/Instagram over the years definitely have resulted in some of the same benefits.</p> \n<strong>Tags:</strong> \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/cycling\">cycling</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/design\">design</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/fashion\">fashion</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Iancu%20Barbarasa\">Iancu Barbarasa</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/sports\">sports</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/video\">video</a>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 23 Nov 2020 18:44:19 +0000","feedId":33,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"013b30f1eac4d18365e69f3d361f57f1","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Jason Kottke","publishedOrCreatedDate":1606802722576},{"createdTime":"2020-12-01 14:05:22","updatedTime":"2020-12-01 14:05:22","title":"How Are You Doing?","link":"https://kottke.org/20/11/how-are-you-doing","description":"<p>As a companion of sorts to <a href=\"https://kottke.org/20/11/how-to-help-a-friend-through-a-tough-time\">the previous post</a>, I ran across <a href=\"https://cohcwcovidsupport.org/\">this infographic</a> on a site of pandemic resources for Colorado healthcare workers that shows some typical responses to different levels of stress.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://kottke.org/plus/misc/images/stress-levels-chart.jpg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Stress Levels Chart\" /></p> \n<p>Sometimes having a tough time can make it difficult to determine just how tough a time you’re having.

Ok, a dystopian neo-noir future, but the future nonetheless. A YouTuber has reworked that score, along with ambient sounds and dialogue from the film, into a feature-length soundscape that, as Colin Marshall put it <a href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2020/11/blade-runner-remastered-soundtrack.html\">at Open Culture</a>, “feels a great deal like watching Blade Runner without actually watching Blade Runner”.

This means that Election Day 2020 in the United States was also my 41st birthday. It was a very strange birthday. But I believe that anyone born in the first week of November who lives and/or votes in this country often finds themselves celebrating strange birthdays. Their memories and experiences of those days are different, more vivid, and more hopelessly entwine the political, civic, and personal.</p> \n<p>I was very nearly born on November 2nd. That was my mother’s 28th birthday. She went into labor at lunch with my aunt and my grandmother. She was enjoying time away from my older brother and sister (then two and five) and didn’t want to change her plans. When she got home, she was well into labor but didn’t tell my father. My godmother, whom my whole family calls my Aunt Joette but who is not, strictly speaking, my aunt, and her husband, my Uncle Mike (same deal) came over to visit. </p> \n<p>Uncle Mike somehow picked up that my mother was having contractions, timed them in his head, and told her when it was time to go to the hospital. He also offered to watch my siblings while my father drove her there. He even cleaned and vacuumed the house, with my brother clinging to his leg. Aunt Joette, who was 26 but already had three children of her own, hopped in the back seat of my parents’ Thunderbird. My mom, now seriously uncomfortable, told my dad to punch it. He drove through Detroit at over 100 mph to Hutzel Hospital, where I would be born. My godmother, always terrified of expressways and fast driving, has never ridden in a car with my father since. My dad still says he has never made such good time downtown.</p> \n<p>But once they got to the hospital, everything stopped. My parents say it was the first sign of how stubborn I could be. (Frankly, this trait is overdetermined in my family.) My mother was in labor for more than 24 hours. Her doctors prepared for an emergency C-section before I arrived, about an hour and a half before the end of November 3. Since 1979 is an odd-numbered year, there wasn’t a federal election that week. But it would have been a good Election Day story if there had been one.</p> \n<p>My mother’s father’s birthday was October 29th. In Detroit, October 30th is Devil’s Night. October 31st is Halloween. November 1st is All Saints’ Day and Dia de los Muertos; this holiday is a pretty big deal in southwest Detroit’s Mexicantown, where Uncle Mike, Aunt Joette, and my cousins Rachel, Nikki, and Miguel went to church at Holy Redeemer. </p> \n<p>November 1st is also my mother’s brother’s birthday. My Uncle Chris is exactly fourteen years younger than my mother and fourteen years older than me. He turned 30 two days before I turned 16, and called my mother the day in between, and since my mom wasn’t home, he and I talked for about half an hour. With leap days included, he is just one day closer in age to my mother than he is to me. My mother’s birthday (and All Souls’ Day) is November 2nd, and mine is November 3rd. It’s a lot of birthdays and holidays in just a few days. My parents’ wedding anniversary is February 5th, which explains why I was born nine months later; the others in my family can plausibly be blamed on cold Michigan nights. This has always made the week of Election Day a pretty big deal in our family.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://kottke.org/plus/misc/images/2003-05-12%2020.03.16.jpg\" width=\"1588\" height=\"1956\" border=\"0\" alt=\"2003-05-12 20.03.16.jpg\" /></p> \n<p>The first President elected in my lifetime was Ronald Reagan, on November 4, 1980. I don’t remember this very well, but I have seen pictures of my first birthday party the day before. My parents, like a surprisingly large number of Americans, both voted for independent candidate John Anderson, supposedly moved that he might be driven to bankruptcy by his campaign debts if he didn’t receive enough of the vote. Either they’re misremembering or are suckers, because in September, Anderson had already qualified for matching funds. Anyways, they both worked multiple jobs and had three small children, and ready access to reliable political information was not very good 40 years ago either.</p> \n<p>I remember Reagan as President, but do not especially remember his reelection on November 6, 1984. I do remember my 5th birthday party extremely well. It was at McDonald’s, and my friends from kindergarten Andrew and Norman were invited. Ronald McDonald was there, I ate at least six Chicken McNuggets (which I still love), and Andrew gave me the He-Man action figure Jitsu, a bad guy with a golden hand that did a karate chop. He was kind of an evil knockoff of Fisto. Another of my uncles also gave me a copy of Jitsu, and I was excited about returning it and picking out a different He-Man character, but my younger brother took the second Jitsu out of its box, so we had two Jitsus, which is at least one too many. My brother was only three, but I was very upset with him.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://kottke.org/plus/misc/images/2003-05-12%2019.57.06.jpg\" width=\"1564\" height=\"1924\" border=\"0\" alt=\"2003-05-12 19.57.06.jpg\" /></p> \n<p>In 1988, my mom and I were pulling for Jesse Jackson, and both of us were pissed off when he didn’t win the nomination. (I’m still mad about this, actually.) This is when I start to remember Phil Hartman’s Ronald Reagan, Dana Carvey’s George H.W. Bush, and Jon Lovitz’s undersung Michael Dukakis (“I can’t believe I’m losing to this guy”). </p> \n<p>My parents were not around very much—my sister is really the one who raised me while the two of them worked, and I’ve always thought of her as an equal parent as well as a beloved sibling—but they indulged my watching late night television and asking questions about the conventions at a young age. George H.W. Bush was elected on November 8th. (See, it’s not really always the first Tuesday in November, because for whatever reason, November 1st doesn’t count.)</p> \n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n <em><strong>[Note, in lieu of art: I do not currently possess any photos of myself from age 12 or 13, which is right and just.] </strong></em>\n</div> \n<div>\n <p>Bill Clinton was elected President on November 3, 1992, my thirteenth birthday. In my junior high’s mock election, held the day before, Ross Perot won in a landslide. (We’d moved to the suburbs by this point.) Why were mostly-white suburban tweens entranced by Perot, who had simply nothing in his history or character to appeal to them, besides perhaps a funny voice? Some of it felt like a collective prank, a joke on the fact that the school was pretending to let us decide something we actually had no choice about: “Let’s all vote for Perot, and see what happens.” <p>I think some people were moved by the idea that something, anything unexpected might happen. It’s like why little kids are fascinated by dinosaurs: here are these creatures, older and bigger than your parents, older and bigger than <em>anything</em>, who once ruled the world. They all died, and anything, no matter how powerful or seemingly inevitable, can die again and be replaced by something new. I don’t know; maybe that was why my parents, still in their late twenties, wanted to vote for Anderson. Maybe that was part of why so many of my friends in college voted for Ralph Nader. Longing for change becomes something more than rational when so many external things determine your life.</p></p> \n <p>Anyways, Bill Clinton was a deeply flawed President and remains a deeply flawed human being. Still, given the choices, I’m happy with how it actually turned out.</p> \n <p>November 3rd was also the day of my last junior high football game. I was a starting defensive tackle, and our team was undefeated. So were our cross-town rivals at Wilkinson. They ran all over us that day: our defense, which had shut out all but one team we played and gone games without giving up any yards, could not stop Jason Byrd, a big, fast, 14-year-old athlete most of us knew from little league baseball. He died in 1997.</p>\n</div> \n<p><img src=\"https://kottke.org/plus/misc/images/2003-08-17%2012.23.51.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"438\" border=\"0\" alt=\"2003-08-17 12.23.51.jpg\" /></p> \n<p>In 2000, I turned 21. Four days later, I voted for the first time. I did not vote in the 1998 midterms, even though Michigan’s governor was on the ballot, because my college town made it difficult for students to register to vote, and because, having just turned 19, I briefly did not believe electoral politics could create genuine change. I was also lazy, and foolish, and preoccupied with many other things.</p> \n<p>But by 2000, I’d had a change of heart, and voted for Al Gore. I now think Gore would have been a better President than I believed then, partly because of the incredibly guarded, talking-out-both-sides-of-his-mouth campaign that he ran, but also because I did not foresee the disaster of the Bush years. I thought things would carry on mostly like they had, and that Bush, while dim and disengaged, would be a relatively benign conservative like I thought his father had been. I also thought he wouldn’t win anyways. I was a real putz. I had studied so much history but had no idea of what history had in store for us.</p> \n<p>That year, my senior year in college, I lived in a big co-op house with fourteen other people. The house was right around the corner from my favorite bar, where I’d rung in my 21st birthday at midnight. We all watched the election results on CBS—I don’t know who chose that network, but Dan Rather had a lot of homespun idioms he used to introduce all the tosses and turns. </p> \n<p>After the news came in that Florida had been called for Gore, then moved to toss-up, then called for Bush, then nobody was sure, my worst roommate, the one who let her dog shit all over the living room carpet, who installed her own private air conditioner even though we all split the utility bills, who everyone hated and nobody could figure out how she’d moved into the house or how to get her to leave, was openly celebrating a Bush win and taunting the rest of us (pretty even split Gore/Nader). I had one thought: <em>I need a drink.</em></p> \n<p><img src=\"https://kottke.org/plus/misc/images/2006-10-06%2013.06.29.jpg\" width=\"623\" height=\"396\" border=\"0\" alt=\"2006-10-06 13.06.29.jpg\" /></p> \n<p>Bush won again, defeating John Kerry after Election Day on November 2, 2004. For me, this was the biggest gut-punch election of my life. I followed it closely, I watched all the debates, I participated in antiwar, anti-Bush, and anti-Cheney demonstrations, and met up with other young people involved in politics in Philadelphia, where I’d moved in 2002. I had thought Gore would win, but was convinced Kerry would—even after the midterm losses in 2002, even after the bombs fell on Iraq the day after my first son was born. </p> \n<p>The next day, my 25th birthday, I walked around the city in a haze. I had to get groceries. The new Trader Joe’s on Market St had opened, right across the street from Center City’s small but lively porno district. I talked to my parents and each of my siblings on the phone, but I don’t remember what any of us said. Ohio was close, and there would be recounts, but it was over. Maybe Kerry would have been a good President, maybe he wouldn’t have, but at that moment, every possibility felt foreclosed upon. <em>This is what they want,</em> I thought. It wasn’t for the first time and certainly would not be the last.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://kottke.org/plus/misc/images/2007-04-02%2007.35.37.jpg\" width=\"604\" height=\"453\" border=\"0\" alt=\"2007-04-02 07.35.37.jpg\" /></p> \n<p>For years, I thought Barack Obama was elected on my birthday in 2008. I even told people in the run-up to the 2020 election, just weeks ago, <em>no, it’s OK, it’s actually good luck: Barack Obama won on my birthday</em>. It’s not true. He was elected on Tuesday, November 4th, the day after. </p> \n<p>But those few days all feel like one day, in the best sense. Now, my younger son had just turned one year old in September, had been walking (for some value of “walking”) since August, and his mother and I hadn’t properly slept yet. On November 3rd, my friends Matt Thompson and Robin Sloan celebrated the fifth anniversary of their blog <a href=\"http://snarkmarket.com/2008/2313\">Snarkmarket</a> by asking me to join them as the site’s third author. I was scrambling to finish my doctoral dissertation in comparative literature, and to send out applications for Assistant Professor and Visiting Fellow jobs that were rapidly disappearing thanks to the economic collapse. (More jobs I applied to cancelled their searches than gave me outright Nos.) </p> \n<p>It was total disaster. And yet somehow, the best thing had happened. Obama was the only Presidential candidate I’d supported in the primary who’d ever made it to the general election (that’s still true, by the way). He was the first Presidential candidate I’d voted for who’d won, and I had a young, multiracial family living in the birthplace of the Declaration of Independence who were counting on him. Health care for everyone, an end to the war in Iraq, real progress for Black and Latinx (we didn’t use the X then, but I will now) and Middle Eastern and South and Central Asian people seemed imminent. I was now 29, and even though I professed to know better, to have made myself properly jaded, properly paranoid, properly realistic about the limits of elected officials, the military, corporations, and the American people… I found myself quite carried away, like so many others. Meanwhile, the slaughterhouse continued its work.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://kottke.org/plus/misc/images/2013-04-02%2013.28.01.jpg\" width=\"960\" height=\"1280\" border=\"0\" alt=\"2013-04-02 13.28.01.jpg\" /></p> \n<p>By November 2012, I was separated. I was living in Manhattan’s Hell’s Kitchen, but still registered to vote in Philadelphia. I had completely bounced out of academia, but somehow wound up with a series of very good jobs writing for technology magazines and websites. My son and his mom had just moved from Philadelphia to Atlanta after Philly’s public schools fell apart, making it much harder for me to take the train to see them.</p> \n<p>My 33rd birthday was nevertheless my favorite ever. I was visiting Washington, DC for a few days, and all my friends in the area gathered to have brunch. Some of them knew each other, and some of them didn’t. We swapped stories about our “formative nerd texts,” the book that shaped our obsessions at an early age. (My answer: Calvin and Hobbes.) I had a crush on someone again, one of the first since my wife, and I didn’t know what to do with it. On the way back to New York, I stopped in Philadelphia to vote for Barack Obama again. (He won.) The city I’d lived in for a decade began to feel less and less like home. When I finally got from Penn Station to my apartment, I felt twin waves of longing and relief.</p> \n<p>I turned 37 on November 3, 2016. My mother had just turned 65. My uncle, whom I remember as eternally 30, turned 51. By then, all of my grandparents had died. I had moved back in with my parents in metro Detroit the year before, partly to help my parents after my father’s heart attack, and partly because I had no place else to go. </p> \n<p>I did not want to celebrate my birthday. I did not want to see or be seen by anyone. I closed off my wall on Facebook well before November. I stopped posting on Twitter a month before Election Day. Even though all the polls and polling averages, which had been so successful in 2008 and 2012 by controlling for known problems, had predicted until shortly before the end that Hillary Clinton would likely sail to an easy victory, I could feel what was coming. </p> \n<p>I felt it in the part of my brain that can recognize a rattlesnake in the grass. There was nothing statistical about it at all, nothing deductive, just pure anticipation. Certain other primates have a word that means “snake,” and everyone in their band knows what it means. When they hear that word, the monkeys run for the trees. My brain was screaming that word, and it was running for the trees. </p> \n<p>I thought, <em>I will vote. And if she wins and he loses, then I will have helped stop this. And then I can kill myself.</em></p> \n<p>Of course, it didn’t work out that way. </p> \n<p><img src=\"https://kottke.org/plus/misc/images/Xpectro%20Avatar.png\" width=\"938\" height=\"1280\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Xpectro Avatar.png\" /></p> \n<p>This Election Day and my 41st birthday have been even more unusual. It was my first birthday without my sister, Kelly. She had also been living with my parents after many years in New York, and died suddenly in April from a pulmonary embolism caused by COVID-19. My sister Kelly was 45 years old.</p> \n<p>She would have been so good at figuring out how to celebrate my birthday and my mom’s, to keep us all safe and still have fun. She would have been so happy to vote to turn Michigan blue again. She would have had my nieces and nephews rolling with laughter at the funeral she didn’t have. She was my parent, and she was my sister. And she had a whole life to live that had nothing to do with me, but still shared with me, that she would tell me about on long telephone calls and late-night talks. And if she loved you, family or friend, she loved every part of you: she loved your parents and partners and children. She was the only person in my family who could befriend every generation, who could tell the third cousins apart, who knew what your second cousins’ kids wanted for Christmas without having to ask.</p> \n<p>I feel like I lost all three people she was: sister, parent, protagonist. I still have so much I want to ask her about. I think I know, but I will never know.</p> \n<p>We couldn’t celebrate my or my mother’s birthday with my brothers and their families, so my mother, my father, and I tried to make an even bigger celebration ourselves. Her birthday bled into mine, as it always does. We bought a Grand Traverse Baking Company cherry crumb pie, which was delicious. We had all already dropped off our ballots in October, so on Election Day (my birthday), we ordered carry-out from my favorite Lebanese restaurant. I bought a bottle of Jameson Irish whiskey, but didn’t drink any of it. I was in a good mood all night (the pie definitely helped), even as Michigan and Pennsylvania remained uncounted, as Georgia remained uncertain, as the blue mirage turned into a red mirage and back again.</p> \n<p>Even now, although nearly all the votes have been counted (and Georgia’s, my son’s adopted home state, have been counted twice), Election Day is somehow not yet over. We knew it would be Election Week; few of us knew it would be Election Month. </p> \n<p>Yet that means somehow my birthday is not yet over; it has metastasized to become all of Scorpio season, perhaps to Thanksgiving and after. And that means I am still only on the verge of turning 41, still 40, still waiting for the clock to turn over to start this next part of my life, a second half if I am lucky, a final third if everything goes <a href=\"https://www.actionnetwork.com/education/chalk\">chalk</a>. I wasn’t born until late in the night on November 3, 1979, and I proved even before I was here that I can wait a very long time. </p> \n<p>Still, I would like this to end, and end properly, even if I have to march on the state house in Michigan’s capitol building with the family I have left to see it out. Everyone is dying again; they have never stopped dying, and I would like to end that too. </p> \n<p>I have no fantasies about Joe Biden or Kamala Harris. I don’t see them as avatars of hope like I saw Barack Obama, or as neoliberal schemers determined to betray their base. But I cannot survive (too many of us cannot survive) the petty fascist death cult of the Republican party under Trump. It has been building to this for generations, but now achieved its worst form yet. I will use every tool at my disposal, including the Democratic party, to crush them and drive them from power, like St. Patrick did Ireland’s snakes in legend.</p> \n<p>They let New Orleans drown; they poisoned Flint; they let the police and bigots fashioning themselves as police murder Black people throughout the country, and then said it was the victims’ fault. They let my sister die and called it a rounding error. They have always been my enemies, ever since I was a little boy watching Ronald Reagan on television and realized what he was, even though I didn’t know the words for it. This was a man who would let us all die and (if he said anything at all) call our deaths noble and brave and necessary, if it would suit his vision of his own power, and perhaps enrich people I would never know.</p> \n<p><em>Snake</em>. The word I was looking for, that I already knew at four years old, was <em>snake</em>.</p> \n<p>My father is terrified of snakes: he says that this is because in Ireland, where his parents were born, they have none. <em>Snake</em> is also what my mother’s people, the Ojibwe or Lake Superior Chippewa, called the Dakota and Lakota peoples when they fought them in what’s now Wisconsin: <em>Sioux</em> is a Chippewa word. (Literally, <em>nadouessioux</em>, or more properly <em>natowessiwak</em>, means “little snakes.”)</p> \n<p>I know that if we want elections worth the name in 2022 or 2024 or any year afterwards, we have to win. The GOP, despite their hold on state legislatures, the courts, and at worst a 50/50 split in the US Senate, are fighting like they will never win a fairly counted, fairly administered, unsuppressed election again. And they might be right. But Democrats have to fight too. For once, Democrats have to forget that they’ve won and continue to fight. </p> \n<p>I would like back everything that I have lost. But until the end of time and the return of the Messiah (and yes, <a href=\"https://kottke.org/18/12/gritty-the-philly-sports-messiah\">I do mean Gritty</a>), none of us can ever have that. All we can look forward to are more birthdays, more yahrzeits, and—I hope—more Election Days.</p> \n<p>Maybe they will even become a holiday. Wouldn’t that be beautiful?</p> \n<strong>Tags:</strong> \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/history\">history</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/politics\">politics</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Tim%20Carmody\">Tim Carmody</a>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 20 Nov 2020 16:30:00 +0000","feedId":33,"bgimg":"https://kottke.org/plus/misc/images/2003-05-12%2015.19.01.jpg","linkMd5":"105c8b2ea99851e6ec3a5e67929cdc3b","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn11@2020_5/2020/12/01/06-05-25-284_5cd196b742d48370.webp","destWidth":1940,"destHeight":1596,"sourceBytes":648492,"destBytes":161856,"author":"Tim Carmody","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://kottke.org/plus/misc/images/2003-05-12%2015.19.01.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn11@2020_5/2020/12/01/06-05-25-284_5cd196b742d48370.webp","https://kottke.org/plus/misc/images/2003-05-12%2020.03.16.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn75@2020_5/2020/12/01/06-05-48-885_8db230aebba89105.webp","https://kottke.org/plus/misc/images/2003-05-12%2019.57.06.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn71@2020_6/2020/12/01/06-05-49-038_e64efb3c0c0425b6.webp","https://kottke.org/plus/misc/images/2003-08-17%2012.23.51.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn57@2020_4/2020/12/01/06-05-48-240_1cb91aac4c02c780.webp","https://kottke.org/plus/misc/images/2006-10-06%2013.06.29.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn82@2020_6/2020/12/01/06-05-48-758_2f42298469d94afd.webp","https://kottke.org/plus/misc/images/2007-04-02%2007.35.37.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn69@2020_4/2020/12/01/06-05-48-492_d42517d578cdd4a1.webp","https://kottke.org/plus/misc/images/2013-04-02%2013.28.01.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn56@2020_1/2020/12/01/06-05-48-445_3b84dfa888bf31d4.webp","https://kottke.org/plus/misc/images/Xpectro%20Avatar.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn68@2020_6/2020/12/01/06-05-48-712_7ed1a092e80cbecc.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1606802722595},{"createdTime":"2020-12-01 14:05:22","updatedTime":"2020-12-01 14:05:22","title":"Rotating Circles Optical Illusion","link":"https://kottke.org/20/11/rotating-circles-optical-illusion","description":"<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/txhcdTS\">This</a> is one of the best optical illusions I’ve ever seen: aside from rotating, these circles don’t move.</p> \n<p><iframe src=\"https://gfycat.com/ifr/EnchantedClearcutBlackfish\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p> \n<p>The left/right/up/down arrows were freaky enough but the in &amp; out arrows really blew a gasket in my brain.

You may have also heard that last night, Maddow returned to her show (still filming from home) to reveal that this person was her partner of 20+ years, artist/photographer Susan Mikula. Mikula is recovering, but at at least one point, the couple genuinely feared for her life. Maddow herself is still testing negative; with Mikula in much less danger and Maddow nearing the end of quarantine, they felt it was time to open the curtain on their experience.</p> \n<p>If you haven’t seen it already, I’d like you to watch the video of Maddow describing her experience of living with a loved one who is suffering from COVID-19, whom you have to care for but cannot touch without grave risk to yourself, and then to others. (It is about Mikula’s own experience, but it’s really much more about Maddow’s experience, for good reason.)</p> \n<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/bLazQ2tlhyM\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p> \n<p>Here’s a quick excerpt, if you want a textual preview (<a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2020/11/rachel-maddow-reveals-her-partner-tested-positive-covid-19.html\">via Vulture</a>):</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>“Just believe me: Whatever you have calculated into your life as acceptable risk, as inevitable risk, something that you’re willing to go through in terms of this virus because statistically, hey probably, it will be fine for you and your loved ones, I’m just here to tell you to recalibrate that,” [Maddow] warned. “Frankly, the country needs you to recalibrate that because broadly speaking, there’s no room for you in the hospital right now.” </p> \n <p>She cites hospitals being overwhelmed with a “50 percent” increase in patients “in two weeks.” While it may be easy to risk your own life, the virus doesn’t let you make the choice. “What you need to know is whoever’s the most important person in your life, whoever you most love and most care for and most cherish in the world, that’s the person who you may lose and who you may spend weeks up all night freaking out about and calling doctors all over the place and over and over again all night long, trying to figure out how to keep that person breathing and out of the hospital,” she said. “Whatever you’re doing, however you’ve calibrated risk in your life, don’t get this thing.”</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Another moment worth noting in the video is shortly after she begins. Maddow is interrupted by a recurring beeping noise in a room off-camera. She has to attend to it herself, in the middle of a live television show, because there’s no one else at home who can do it. She takes off her microphone and earpiece, then has to put it back on. After already revealing at the beginning of the show that she’s not wearing makeup—she doesn’t know how to apply it herself, and no one can help her—it’s a nice peek behind the scenes.</p> \n<p>I don’t know if everyone always understands how much work it takes it is to perform for live television: how many accessories you need, how much support is required. People don’t see what you have to look like, sound like, or act like; they don’t see the almost cyborg contraption you have to become in order to make a successful television appearance. Being good at television is a specific skill. It’s as different from writing, reporting, or public speaking as football, baseball, and basketball are from playing polo. It doesn’t matter if you have your words on a teleprompter (although that does help): you still have to deliver them, in time, no backsies, and look and sound good while you’re doing it.</p> \n<p>The disruption of the show also happens in the middle of a charming metaphor Maddow uses to describe her relationship:</p> \n<blockquote>\n The way that I think about it is not that she is the sun and I’m a planet that orbits her—that would give too much credit to the other planets. I think of it more as a pitiful thing: that she is the planet and I am a satellite, and I’m up there sort of beep-beep-beeping at her and blinking my lights and just trying to make her happy.\n</blockquote> \n<p>Compare this to Farhad Manjoo’s essay in The New York Times today, “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/20/opinion/covid-bubble-thanksgiving-family.html\">I Traced My COVID-19 Bubble and It’s Enormous</a>.” Manjoo starts with a classic dilemma: they know it’s unsafe in general to travel for Thanksgiving, but they wonder if it might be safer for their family, given the size of their social circle and the precautions they’ve taken. They’d like to find out more, to replace their general intuitions, which pull them in both directions, with something more concrete. This is a time-honored journalistic premise (a rhetorical trope, really) for answering a question many people might have.</p> \n<p>In researching their close contacts, and their own exposure to other people, Manjoo quickly has cold water thrown on the notion that their bubble is in any way contained to the degree they’d imagined it to be. (This part of the story is well-illustrated: I’ll give you the text excerpts, but it’s worth clicking through and scrolling through yourself.)</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>I thought my bubble was pretty small, but it turned out to be far larger than I’d guessed.</p> \n <p>My only close contacts each week are my wife and kids.</p> \n <p>My kids, on the other hand, are in a learning pod with seven other children and my daughter attends a weekly gymnastics class.</p> \n <p>I emailed the parents of my kids’ friends and classmates, as well as their teachers, and asked how large each family’s bubble was.</p> \n <p>Already, my network was up to almost 40 people.</p> \n <p>Turns out a few of the families in our learning pod have children in day care or preschool.</p> \n <p>And one’s classmate’s mother is a doctor who comes into contact with about 10 patients each week.</p> \n <p>Once I had counted everyone, I realized that visiting my parents for Thanksgiving would be like asking them to sit down to dinner with more than 100 people.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>They aren’t actually done counting yet: from themself, they’ve only gone to three degrees of separation. But presumably, the point in the headline is made. The author’s bubble is enormous, and presumably the reader’s is, too.</p> \n<p>Then a curious thing happens. Manjoo decides that what they’ve learned doesn’t matter. They thinks their family and their contacts are special after all. “All of my indirect contacts are taking the virus seriously—none of them spun conspiracy theories about the pandemic, or suggested it was no big deal or told me to bug off and mind my own business.” (This is a very low threshold for “taking the virus seriously.”) And they would <em>really</em> like to take their wife and children to see their parents. An epidemiologist gives them some cover, saying their desire to see their parents is understandable, and it’s all a matter of assessing and evaluating risk.</p> \n<p>So, they change their mind again. They make a few concessions (drive, not fly; an outdoor meal rather than an indoor one; staying off-site rather than sleeping over). And they’re going to travel five hours each way with their wife and children and their 100+ direct and indirect contacts to celebrate Thanksgiving with their parents.</p> \n<p>This is contrarianism on a scale not usually seen in a newspaper article. (They’re usually too short to take this many turns.) It is one thing to counter received wisdom by posing a counterfactual. It is another to spend hours of reporting, gathering facts, calling in experts, putting everything on the record, and then deciding that none of that matters. </p> \n<p>On Twitter, I called it “<a href=\"https://twitter.com/tcarmody/status/1329839100699025409\">the full Gladwell</a>”; only Malcolm Gladwell at The New Yorker can <a href=\"https://niemanreports.org/stories/whys-this-so-good-no-35-malcolm-gladwell-ketchup-tim-carmody/\">consistently pull this hairpin twist off</a> and stick the landing, even if he frequently violates good sense and plain facts to do it.</p> \n<p>It’s important, though, that this is not just a rhetorical trick. These are the real lives of real people, both in the story itself, and radiating out to its readers and their contacts in a global newspaper, the United States’ paper of record. And the reasoning and evidence that are considered but discarded gives the illusion that this is a choice motivated not by setting reason aside, but considering all options and maximizing one’s expected utility.</p> \n<p>Not to “both sides” this, but I’m gonna “both sides” this: in some sense, both Maddow and Manjoo are putting their thumb on the scales, in opposite directions. For Maddow, the experience of almost losing the love of her life makes it so that she would take no willing risk that might endanger her or anyone else. (She acknowledges that a certain amount of unavoidable, unwilling risk remains.) </p> \n<p>Manjoo is different. They acknowledge that they have no such experience. They are less concerned with the possible loss of their parents’ lives than the loss of their presence in his life and in their childrens’ lives. They see the willing assumption of risk as an open moral question, and something that can be calculated and appropriately mitigated.</p> \n<p>Maddow has constructed a universe where she is a tiny satellite orbiting a much larger planet, whose continued health and existence is the central focus of her concern. Manjoo has drawn a map with themself at its center, where anyone beyond the reach of their telephone falls off the edges.</p> \n<p>Maddow is also explicitly pleading with her viewers to learn what they can from her experience, and adjust their behavior accordingly. Manjoo is performing their calculus only for themself; they implicitly present themself as a representative example (while also claiming they and their circle are extraordinarily conscientious and effective), but each reader can draw their own conclusions and make their own decision.</p> \n<p>At this point the balancing dominoes tip over. Maddow’s position, her argument, and her example are clearly more moral and more persuasive than Manjoo’s. Manjoo’s essay is worth reading, but the conclusion is untenable. It doesn’t do the work needed to arrive there or persuade anyone else to do the same. And at a time when many people are spinning conspiracies about the pandemic, or claiming that it’s no big deal, and in turn influencing others—when we haven’t even yet considered the virus’s impact on the uncounted number of people, from medical staff and many other essential workers to prisoners and the impoverished, who do not simply get to choose how to spend their holiday—it’s irresponsible.</p> \n<p>The larger moral tragedy is that because our leaders have failed, and too often actually worked to damage the infrastructure, expertise, and goodwill accumulated over generations, we have no consistent, authoritative guidance on what we should and should not do. We do not know who to trust. We have no money, no help, and no plan but to wait. We have no sense of what rules our friends and neighbors, colleagues and workers, are following when they’re not in our sight; we don’t even know what practices they would even admit to embracing. We have no money; we have no help. We are left on our own, adrift in deep space, scribbling maps and adding sums on the back of a napkin. We are all in this together, yet we are completely alone.</p> \n<p><strong>Update:</strong> An earlier version of this post used incorrect pronouns for Farhad Manjoo. Manjoo uses they/them pronouns. I regret the error, which, compunded, led to many errors. —TC</p> \n<p><strong>Second Update:</strong> Actually, Farhad uses both they/them <em>and</em> he/him pronouns. I am relieved I didn’t inadvertently offend the subject of my post with the first version, and since this one is still correct, I am not changing it back. </p> \n<strong>Tags:</strong> \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/COVID-19\">COVID-19</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/ethics\">ethics</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Farhad%20Manjoo\">Farhad Manjoo</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Rachel%20Maddow\">Rachel Maddow</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/television\">television</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/TV\">TV</a>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 20 Nov 2020 22:45:00 +0000","feedId":33,"bgimg":"https://kottke.org/plus/misc/images/deep-space.jpg","linkMd5":"a0034c0a3b81e143a6b9dcf0208c2b31","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn25@2020_1/2020/12/01/06-05-26-839_eb781a283109fd8f.webp","destWidth":4800,"destHeight":2700,"sourceBytes":2036513,"destBytes":1328364,"author":"Tim Carmody","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://kottke.org/plus/misc/images/deep-space.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn25@2020_1/2020/12/01/06-05-26-839_eb781a283109fd8f.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1606802722594},{"createdTime":"2020-12-01 14:05:22","updatedTime":"2020-12-01 14:05:22","title":"How to Help a Friend Through a Tough Time","link":"https://kottke.org/20/11/how-to-help-a-friend-through-a-tough-time","description":"<p>Based on the four separate conversations I had with friends this weekend (and reading/watching assorted social media posts), it seems like everyone is really struggling with the pandemic right now, perhaps more so than back in March/April/May.

I myself have been all right recently, thankful I’m able to do what I can to support others, but it really varies from week to week.</p> \n<p>A year ago, before the pandemic set in, clinical psychologist Kathryn Gordon wrote a piece for Vox <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/first-person/2019/12/10/21003228/how-to-help-a-friend\">on how to help people that you know through a tough time</a>. You may have seen similar advice before — e.g. <a href=\"https://kottke.org/18/10/how-do-you-help-a-grieving-friend\">How Do You Help a Grieving Friend?</a> — but now seems like a good time for a refresher. Here’s one of Gordon’s four tips on how to help:</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>Ask them how they are feeling. Then, listen non-judgmentally to their response. The simple act of asking someone how they’re doing, with an open-ended question, shows that you care. Listen attentively rather than interrupting or offering your opinion. Ask simple follow-up questions like, “What does that feel like?” or “What has been on your mind as you’re going through this?” This communicates that you genuinely want to know how they’re doing and feel comfortable hearing the truth.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>I hope you’re getting the support you need during all of this and are able to find small pockets of time &amp; energy in which to be useful to those around you. <span style=\"color:#cc0000;\">♥</span></p> \n<strong>Tags:</strong> \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/COVID-19\">COVID-19</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Kathryn%20Gordon\">Kathryn Gordon</a>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 30 Nov 2020 18:08:23 +0000","feedId":33,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"a1fc1043e16762a715943c273e36bc4b","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Jason Kottke","publishedOrCreatedDate":1606802722569},{"createdTime":"2020-12-01 14:05:22","updatedTime":"2020-12-01 14:05:22","title":"Imagining a Covid-19 Pandemic Memorial","link":"https://kottke.org/20/11/imagining-a-covid-19-pandemic-memorial","description":"<p><img src=\"https://kottke.org/plus/misc/images/covid-memorial.jpg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Covid Memorial\" /></p> \n<p>Even though we’re still in the midst of it, <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2020/11/what-should-a-covid-19-memorial-be/617137/\">The Atlantic commissioned three designers/artists to design hypothetical Covid-19 memorials</a>. Ian Bogost writes:</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>So this might seem like a strange time to imagine memorializing the pandemic in a formal way. A premature time. Maya Lin’s Vietnam Veterans Memorial was conceived in 1981, six years after the United States had withdrawn from the conflict. Michael Arad and Peter Walker’s 9/11 memorial broke ground at the site of the World Trade Center in 2006, almost five years after the attacks.</p> \n <p>But there are downsides to waiting. A traumatic event is an author of its own memorial; as a famous anecdote attests, when a Nazi soldier asked Pablo Picasso if he had made Guernica, the famous painting the artist created during the month following the Luftwaffe’s bombing of its Basque namesake in 1937, Picasso replied, “No, you did.” The feelings, facts, and ideas available during a calamity dissipate as it ebbs. The temptation arises to contain tragedy in a tidy box, closing the book on its history.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>Each of the three ideas is intriguing in its own way. I liked how Ronald Rael and Virginia San Fratello (who made those <a href=\"https://kottke.org/19/08/the-border-wall-seesaw\">border wall teeter-totters</a> last year) explained their thought process (which Rael elaborated on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CH-uf8MBvI1/\">here</a>).</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>Quarantine has limited our ability to use smell and touch for communion, so she and Rael became interested in finding a way to replicate the experience. That’s where pennies come in: Copper is an antiviral — a quality with obvious symbolism in the moment — and one that evolves over time, developing a patina as it interacts with water and air. So the pair latched on to it as a material.</p> \n <p>Rael San Fratello’s first idea was a pragmatic one: a traditional memorial made of copper molded into a bulbous, organic wall. The copper material would invite the touch lost to quarantine. Outdoors, it could develop a green or purple patina. “If touched constantly,” San Fratello said, “the patina might never occur, and the memorial will remain shiny.”</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>See also <a href=\"https://kottke.org/20/08/the-world-memorial-to-the-pandemic\">the design for a pandemic memorial already in the planning stages in Uruguay</a>.</p> \n<strong>Tags:</strong> \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/architecture\">architecture</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/art\">art</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/COVID-19\">COVID-19</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Ian%20Bogost\">Ian Bogost</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Ronald%20Rael\">Ronald Rael</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Virginia%20San%20Fratello\">Virginia San Fratello</a>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 25 Nov 2020 15:48:55 +0000","feedId":33,"bgimg":"https://kottke.org/plus/misc/images/covid-memorial.jpg","linkMd5":"a931190ff0be33ff98644c7924431e0d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn24@2020_1/2020/12/01/06-05-28-024_ff583787f5f21372.webp","destWidth":1000,"destHeight":1000,"sourceBytes":85239,"destBytes":27042,"author":"Jason Kottke","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://kottke.org/plus/misc/images/covid-memorial.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn24@2020_1/2020/12/01/06-05-28-024_ff583787f5f21372.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1606802722595},{"createdTime":"2020-12-01 14:05:22","updatedTime":"2020-12-01 14:05:22","title":"Rebecca Solnit: We Don’t Need to Meet Nazis Halfway","link":"https://kottke.org/20/11/rebecca-solnit-we-dont-need-to-meet-nazis-halfway","description":"<p>Writing for Lithub, Rebecca Solnit on <a href=\"https://lithub.com/rebecca-solnit-on-not-meeting-nazis-halfway/\">On Not Meeting Nazis Halfway</a>.</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito just complained that “you can’t say that marriage is a union between one man and one woman. Now it’s considered bigotry.” This is a standard complaint of the right: the real victim is the racist who has been called a racist, not the victim of his racism, the real oppression is to be impeded in your freedom to oppress. And of course Alito is disingenuous; you can say that stuff against marriage equality (and he did). Then other people can call you a bigot, because they get to have opinions too, but in his scheme such dissent is intolerable, which is fun coming from a member of the party whose devotees wore “fuck your feelings” shirts at its rallies and popularized the term “snowflake.”</p> \n <p>Nevertheless, we get this hopelessly naive version of centrism, of the idea that if we’re nicer to the other side there will be no other side, just one big happy family. This inanity is also applied to the questions of belief and fact and principle, with some muddled cocktail of moral relativism and therapists’ “everyone’s feelings are valid” applied to everything. But the truth is not some compromise halfway between the truth and the lie, the fact and the delusion, the scientists and the propagandists. And the ethical is not halfway between white supremacists and human rights activists, rapists and feminists, synagogue massacrists and Jews, xenophobes and immigrants, delusional transphobes and trans people. Who the hell wants unity with Nazis until and unless they stop being Nazis?</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>Reading this, I was reminded of <a href=\"https://kottke.org/17/08/the-paradox-of-tolerance\">the paradox of tolerance</a>:</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>Unlimited tolerance must lead to the disappearance of tolerance. If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant, if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>And also, I can’t remember where I heard this recently, but it’s perhaps worth noting that in game theory (I know, <a href=\"https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/its-time-for-some-game-theory\">I know</a>), when you’re dealing with an iterated <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma\">prisoner’s dilemma</a> situation (where two competitors are engaged in repeated confrontation), one of the the best strategies is called <a href=\"https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolab/segments/104010-one-good-deed-deserves-another\">generous tit-for-tat</a>. Playing a generous tit-for-tat strategy means cooperating on the first move and then mirroring whatever the other player did on their previous move — but, crucially, occasionally cooperating after an attack as a opening to potential future collaboration. So, if the other party cooperates, so do you. And if the other party attacks, attack back…but not every time. Attempting to collaborate in the face of repeated attack leaves the door open to reestablish a virtuous cooperation cycle. The real world of national politics is not quite so simple, but it seems like a shift in strategy for progressives might be in order.

The big thing? State officials recognized that those most at risk needed more support.</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>There’s a fatal flaw embedded in the basic Covid-19 test, trace, and isolate trifecta used around the world: It doesn’t account for the fact that the coronavirus is not an equal-opportunity pathogen. The people who are most likely to be tested, and to have the easiest time quarantining or isolating, are also the least likely to get sick and die from the virus.</p> \n <p>From the United Kingdom to Sweden to Canada, we have evidence that the virus preys on people employed in “essential service” jobs (bus drivers, nurses, factory workers), which don’t allow for telecommuting or paid sick leave; people in low-income neighborhoods; and people in “congregate housing” like shelters, prisons, and retirement homes.</p> \n <p>People of color tend to be overrepresented in these groups — but there’s no biological reason they’re more likely to get sick and die from the virus. Simply put: They tend to work jobs that bring them outside the home and into close contact with other people, live in crowded environments ideal for coronavirus contagion, or both.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>The state then directed efforts, resources, and money to nursing homes, the unhoused, prisons, and essential workers to make it easier for those folks to stay safe.</p> \n<p>I also thought this bit was really interesting:</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>There’s a simple adage in public health: “Never do a test without offering something in exchange,” said Johns Hopkins’s Stefan Baral. So when a patient gets tested for HIV, for example, they’re offered treatment, support, or contact tracing. “We’re not just doing the testing to get information but also providing a clear service,” Baral added, and potentially preventing that person from spreading the virus any further. “This is basic public health.”</p> \n <p>With Covid-19, the US has failed at basic public health. Across the country, people have been asked to get tested without anything offered in exchange.</p> \n <p>“If we are asking people to stay home and not work, we have to make sure society is supporting them,” Baral said. “An equitable program would support people to do the right thing.”</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>“Never do a test without offering something in exchange.” To the extent that federal and state governments have been asking to people to stay home, get tested, and wear a mask, many of those same governments have been unwilling or unable to provide people with much in return for doing so. And so, here we are months into this, paying for that inaction with 250,000 lives.</p> \n<p><strong title=\"Nov 23, 2020\">Update:</strong> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MarkLevineNYC/status/1329414312662765574\">How NYC does “never do a test without offering something in exchange”</a>:</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>You can access a free hotel room to safely isolate from your family, which include meals, Rx delivery, free wi-fi, medical staff on site, and transportation to and from hotel and medical appointments.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>(via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/agoX/status/1329505546895028231\">@agoX</a>)</p> \n<strong>Tags:</strong> \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/COVID-19\">COVID-19</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Julia%20Belluz\">Julia Belluz</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/medicine\">medicine</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/NYC\">NYC</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/science\">science</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/USA\">USA</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Vermont\">Vermont</a>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 19 Nov 2020 18:56:44 +0000","feedId":33,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"4dcd045fe98fe0447710c9f017a9c0a6","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Jason Kottke","publishedOrCreatedDate":1606802722586},{"createdTime":"2020-12-01 14:05:22","updatedTime":"2020-12-01 14:05:22","title":"Raising Baby Grey, a Gender-Neutral Child","link":"https://kottke.org/20/11/raising-baby-grey-a-gender-neutral-child","description":"<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/g4o87MOY5R4\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p> \n<p>In this short film from <a href=\"https://www.alexmallis.com/\">Alex Mallis</a>, we meet a Bronx couple who are raising their child Grey in a gender-neutral way until they make a decision for themselves.

Of course, it’s impossible to parent without error, and society does its share of damage, to many of us, without the help of parents. Asking a child to inhabit such a complex and politicized position is demanding, but so is asking a child to perform femininity or masculinity. I get the sense that many trans people would unambivalently prefer to have been raised without the gender they were assigned at birth and its attendant expectations. For me, it’s less clear. If my parents had made every effort to free me from the strictures of the gender binary, I might have rebelled against their liberal piety or appreciated their efforts — or maybe both.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<strong>Tags:</strong> \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Alex%20Mallis\">Alex Mallis</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Crispin%20Long\">Crispin Long</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/gender\">gender</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/LGBT\">LGBT</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/video\">video</a>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 24 Nov 2020 19:36:38 +0000","feedId":33,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"8cc3b973bd95b33d8fb3d320c8e6b9a1","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Jason Kottke","publishedOrCreatedDate":1606802722576},{"createdTime":"2020-12-01 14:05:22","updatedTime":"2020-12-01 14:05:22","title":"250 Days of Daily Pandemic Drawings","link":"https://kottke.org/20/11/250-days-of-daily-pandemic-drawings","description":"<p>Author and illustrator <a href=\"https://edwardcareyauthor.com/\">Edward Carey</a> has been making a drawing a day since the beginning of the pandemic.

The findings were perplexing. Two full doses of the vaccine appeared to be only 62% effective at preventing disease, while a half dose, followed by a full dose, was about 90% effective. That latter analysis was conducted on a small subset of the study participants, only 2,741.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>Hopefully more study will be done on that dosage question. <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/oxford-coronavirus-pandemic-c99d26eb2946f6fde45a1edc002ff028\">From the AP</a>:</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>“The report that an initial half-dose is better than a full dose seems counterintuitive for those of us thinking of vaccines as normal drugs: With drugs, we expect that higher doses have bigger effects, and more side-effects,” he said. “But the immune system does not work like that.”</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>The seemingly lower efficacy comes with some perhaps significant benefits: this vaccine is cheaper to produce and doesn’t require any special refrigeration.</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>The vaccine can be transported under “normal refrigerated conditions” of 2 to 8 degrees Celsius (36 to 46 degrees Fahrenheit), AstraZeneca said. By comparison, Pfizer plans to distribute its vaccine using specially designed “thermal shippers” that use dry ice to maintain temperatures of minus-70 degrees Celsius (minus-94 degrees Fahrenheit).</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines were pretty similar in many respects and this one seems quite different. These results were just released a few hours ago, so it will be interesting to follow the debate and expert commentary on this. Stay tuned…</p> \n<p><strong title=\"Nov 24, 2020\">Update:</strong> This is amazing: the seemingly more effective 1/2 dose + full dose regimen <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-astrazeneca-dosing-idUSKBN28327Q\">was a mistake</a>.</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>Around the time when Astra was initiating its partnership with Oxford at the end of April, university researchers were administering doses to trial participants in Britain.</p> \n <p>They soon noticed expected side effects such as fatigue, headaches or arm aches were milder than expected, he said.</p> \n <p>“So we went back and checked … and we found out that they had underpredicted the dose of the vaccine by half,” said Pangalos.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>A far smaller number of participants was given the initial half-dose, so more research will need to be done to determine if this mistake will be added to the long list of scientific discoveries made because of errors. <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03326-w\">There’s a good piece in Nature</a> that talks about what we know and don’t know about the vaccine results so far along with some informed speculation.</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>But, if the differences are bona fide, researchers are eager to understand why. “I don’t think it’s an anomaly,” says Katie Ewer, an immunologist at Oxford’s Jenner Institute who is working on the vaccine. “I’m keen to get into the lab and start thinking about how we address that question.” She has two leading theories for why a lower first dose might have led to better protection against COVID. It’s possible that lower doses of vaccine do a better job at stimulating the subset of immune cells called T cells that support the production of antibodies, she says.</p> \n <p>Another potential explanation is the immune system’s response against the chimpanzee virus. The vaccine triggers an immune response not only to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, but also to components of the viral vector. It’s possible that the full first dose blunted this reaction, says Ewer. She plans to look at antibody responses against the chimpanzee virus to help address this question.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p><strong title=\"Nov 24, 2020\">Update:</strong> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nataliexdean/status/1331355221549670400\">A short thread by Dr. Natalie Dean</a>, which leads with “AstraZeneca/Oxford get a poor grade for transparency and rigor when it comes to the vaccine trial results they have reported”.</p> \n<strong>Tags:</strong> \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/AstraZeneca\">AstraZeneca</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/COVID-19\">COVID-19</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/medicine\">medicine</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Natalie%20Dean\">Natalie Dean</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/science\">science</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/vaccines\">vaccines</a>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 23 Nov 2020 14:51:51 +0000","feedId":33,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"c0cac5e4addb0abd53b57e6f3fee11ee","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Jason Kottke","publishedOrCreatedDate":1606802722576},{"createdTime":"2020-12-01 14:05:22","updatedTime":"2020-12-01 14:05:22","title":"Our Friend","link":"https://kottke.org/20/11/our-friend","description":"<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GTWqGLnOxtA\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p> \n<p>That’s the trailer for Our Friend, a movie based on the true story told in this Esquire article by Matthew Teague: <a href=\"https://www.esquire.com/lifestyle/a34905/matthew-teague-wife-cancer-essay/\">The Friend: Love Is Not a Big Enough Word</a>.</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>His wife was just thirty-four.
