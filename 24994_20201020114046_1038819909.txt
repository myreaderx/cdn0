We started with expanded storage plans, the ability to share your storage with family members, live support for all your Google questions, and member benefits like Google Play credits and Google Store member rewards.</p><p>Last year, we launched <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/google-one/new-phone-backup/\">automatic phone backup</a> for members on Android devices. So no matter what happens to your phone, you won’t lose the important stuff like texts, contacts and apps, and photos and videos. <br/></p><p>To bring this peace of mind to more people, we’re making some Google One features—phone backup and a new storage manager tool—free for Google users <a href=\"https://support.google.com/googleone/answer/9080668\">wherever Google One is available</a>. You can back up your devices and clean up your files across Google Photos, Google Drive, and Gmail—all in the new Google One app for Android and iOS.<br/></p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p></p><h3>Back up your Android or iOS phone</h3>Automatic phone backup will be available on Android phones, even if you don’t have a Google One membership. And if you have an iPhone, we’re introducing a new iOS app that lets you store photos, videos, contacts, and calendar events with Google. Start backing up your phone with the Google One app, and save the stuff you care about using the free 15 GB of storage that comes with your Google Account. If you break, lose, or upgrade your phone, you can rest easy knowing that your data is safe in the cloud.<p></p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--medium h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--4 h-c-grid__col--offset-4 \"><img alt=\"G1_BackUp_Blog.gif\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/G1_BackUp_Blog.gif\"/></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p></p><h3>Clean up and organize your storage</h3>But peace of mind is about more than just safekeeping your information—it’s just as important to be able to easily manage and clean up your files across Drive, Gmail, and Photos.
