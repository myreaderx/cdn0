That isn&#8217;t to say there aren&#8217;t similar behaviors between the two, but the way they handle moving from one account to another is a very different experience when sat side by side.  For Chrome OS, you sign in with a profile (Google account) and can add other Google accounts inside that system-level log in for use with apps both on the web and via Android.  That is how I operate and how most people get around on a Chromebook.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are inherent limitations to this approach, however, since my personal Google account is logged in on my Chromebook, my Files app accesses my personal Google Drive, not my G Suite drive that is attached to my Chrome Unboxed account.  My bookmarks and Chrome browser settings are my personal setup, not separated into personal and work.  On Windows, Mac or Linux, however, this is handled quite differently.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On those operating systems, you log into Chrome and create user profiles.  Multiple profiles can exist on one version of Chrome and be accessed at the same time, allowing for a nice separation of work and personal setups.  You can even create desktop shortcuts to different profiles to keep things separated.  My current workflow mixes all my bookmarks together since that is the primary profile I&#8217;m logged into my Chromebook with and I honestly envy the setup Windows, Linux and Mac users get with the ability to truly separate out their work/personal accounts in Chrome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With all that in mind, these changes to the profile user flow won&#8217;t have any affect or be present on Chromebooks.  With Chromebooks handling the profile switching on an OS level, this all works in a very different way and the new profile setup we&#8217;re about to see simply isn&#8217;t present at all on Chromebooks and may never be.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"crp_related crp_related_block  \"><h5>more from Chrome Unboxed</h5><ul><li><a href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/chrome-os-account-log-in-settings-android-native/\"    target=\"_blank\"  class=\"post-10977\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  width=\"150\" height=\"150\"  src=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/newLogInChromeOSunifiedFeature-150x150.jpg\" class=\"crp_thumb crp_featured\" alt=\"This new feature in Chrome OS 76 makes Android feel so much more native on Chromebooks\" title=\"This new feature in Chrome OS 76 makes Android feel so much more native on Chromebooks\" /><span class=\"crp_title\">This new feature in Chrome OS 76 makes Android feel so much more native on Chromebooks</span></a><span class=\"crp_author\">  by <a href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/author/robbypayne/\">Robby Payne</a></span> </li></ul><div class=\"crp_clear\"></div></div>\n\n\n<p>Now then, let&#8217;s take a look at the updated UI for adding profiles to Chrome in Windows, Linux and MacOS coming in Chrome 87 (currently in Canary) that was <a href=\"https://techdows.com/2020/08/chrome-new-profile-picker.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">spotted by Techdows.</a>  There&#8217;s not really any new functionality going on here, but the interface looks very nice and is very clear when communicating what is going on for users new to the experience of adding multiple profiles to Chrome.

Ideally this is where you could go ahead and choose a theme as well, but we&#8217;re not seeing that yet.  There&#8217;s a large box under the name that is useless for now, but will likely be used for something down the road.  Finally, you can go ahead and choose to create a quick desktop shortcut for this new profile from this screen.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-attachment-id=\"24941\" data-permalink=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/new-chrome-user-profile-picker-canary-87/newprofileui-4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/newProfileUI-4.png\" data-orig-size=\"1800,1200\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&#34;aperture&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;credit&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;camera&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;caption&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;created_timestamp&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;copyright&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;focal_length&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;iso&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;shutter_speed&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;title&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;orientation&#34;:&#34;0&#34;}\" data-image-title=\"newProfileUI-4\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/newProfileUI-4-300x200.png\" data-large-file=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/newProfileUI-4-1024x683.png\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/newProfileUI-4-1024x683.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-24941\" srcset=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/newProfileUI-4-1024x683.png 1024w, https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/newProfileUI-4-300x200.png 300w, https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/newProfileUI-4-768x512.png 768w, https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/newProfileUI-4-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/newProfileUI-4.png 1800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Profile made, ready to log in</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, you get to this colorful screen where you can get started or choose to log in and sync an existing Google account.  Once synced up, all you usual Chrome settings and bookmarks will come along for the ride and this local profile will be tied to you cloud data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, the user flow update looks nice and is very clear in displaying and conveying the profile setup process.  I&#8217;m not sure how many users take advantage of this feature in Chrome, but if you are currently not on a Chromebook and using Chrome, I&#8217;d highly recommend getting started with profiles if you leverage multiple Google accounts.

Since the onset of the pandemic that sent so many of us into our homes, Google Meet, Zoom and other video conferencing platforms have experienced explosive growth and as a result, have been inclined to beef up features in a response to the growing growing trend of remote work and learning. While Zoom has become the platform for millions of users, Google too has risen to the challenge with new features and wider availability of video conferencing platform that was once exclusive to GSuite accounts. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Google Meet makes perfect sense for the countless institutions that already use Google Classroom and manage accounts and devices with GSuite&#8217;s Admin Console. However, despite the recent upgrades and improvements to Google Meet, there are a few attributes that are still lacking from Google&#8217;s robust video chat. In late June, Google announced that GSuite Education accounts would eventually add the ability for participants to use the &#8220;raise&#8221; hand&#8221; feature which allows teachers to maintain order in the virtual classroom. This feature is set to come along with other updates such as virtual whiteboards for collaboration and attendance tracking but they aren&#8217;t slated to arrive until October. <strong>So, what do you do in the mean time? </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a friendly IT admin who&#8217;s willing to help you out, there are some third-party tools to help you get the most out of you Google Meet virtual classroom. We&#8217;ve talked about some of these in the past but when the pandemic started, few of us expected that it would have the long-term effects that would potentially extend into 2021. So, we&#8217;re going to highlight three Chrome extensions that can help you manage your Google Meet video chats and hopefully, get the most out of your virtual school day. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Nod</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I can tell you from my daughter&#8217;s first day of online learning, teachers do not have it easy when it comes to managing a virtual room full of second graders. When you&#8217;re in-person, it&#8217;s much easier to directly address an individual student and handle feedback, in general. When you have 30+ students in a Google Meet chat, getting everyone to mute their mics and interact via chat or simply wave at the camera to get the teacher&#8217;s attention is a massive undertaking. It creates a bit of a chaotic environment and that takes away from the entire learning experience. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Nod - Reactions for Google Meet\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KpqifxNXrLA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While you&#8217;re waiting for Google to add the hand-raise feature to Meet, you can ask your IT admin to add this &#8220;handy&#8221; extension to your approved list and even push it to school-owned devices and accounts. Nod-Reactions for Google Meet gives every user the ability to grab the teacher&#8217;s attention with a silent raise of a digital hand. In addition to keeping order with hand raises, Nod offers a handful of emoji responses that are perfect for students to let their teacher know that they are on pace with the current lesson. Visual feedback is very important when you&#8217;re meeting online and Nod offers a simple and free way to do just that with minimal disruption to the learning environment. If you are using Google Meet without a GSuite account, you can use Nod right now. If you&#8217;re interested in getting for your classroom, contact your IT department and ask them to help you get it set up for you and your students. Find it in the Chrome Web Store below. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nod-reactions-for-google/oikgofeboedgfkaacpfepbfmgdalabej?hl=en\" class=\"BuyButton\" target=\"_blank\">Nod &#8211; Reactions for Google Meet</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Google Meet Attendance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Another feature that Google has promised is on the way for Meet is the ability for teachers to take attendance digitally right in the video chat. This will be a powerful tool when it finally arrives as it will save teachers hours upon hours of precious time throughout the school year. Thankfully, teachers are resourceful and many of them take it upon themselves to find solutions instead of waiting on someone else to do it. I found a couple of extensions that take on the task of attendance rosters in Google Meet but one, in particular, stood out because it&#8217;s simple, does exactly what you want it to and gets out of the way when you&#8217;re not using it. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"crp_related crp_related_block  \"><h5>more from Chrome Unboxed</h5><ul><li><a href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/zoom-responds-security-fixes-industry-standard-zoombombing-password-waiting-room/\"    target=\"_blank\"  class=\"post-16644\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  width=\"150\" height=\"150\"  src=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Zoom-White-150x150.jpg\" class=\"crp_thumb crp_featured\" alt=\"Zoom&#039;s response to its own flaws should set the industry standard\" title=\"Zoom&#039;s response to its own flaws should set the industry standard\" /><span class=\"crp_title\">Zoom&#8217;s response to its own flaws should set the industry standard</span></a><span class=\"crp_author\">  by <a href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/author/gabe/\">Gabriel Brangers</a></span> </li></ul><div class=\"crp_clear\"></div></div>\n\n\n<p>Google Meet Attendance was created by a Math and Computer teacher out of Ontario. Mr. Caughey developed the Chrome extension for the very same reason many of you landed on this article. <strong>Attendance</strong>. However, his free extension does even more that just punch the attendance roster. Teachers can create and save multiple class lists and when students join Meet, their attendance is registered. Not only that, the extension will tell you how long each student was in the meeting and their is support for eight languages with more on the way. The reports are saved in a neat, HTML form for teachers to use as needed. The developer does emphasize that the extension collects NO data so it&#8217;s safe for your students to use and you can find that policy and more on the Git page <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://github.com/al-caughey/Google-Meet-Attendance\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. You can download the Google Meet Attendance extension from the Web Store at the link below but don&#8217;t forget to get with you IT admin to get it enabled. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-meet-attendance/fkdjflnaggakjamjkmimcofefhppfljd/related?hl=en\" class=\"BuyButton\" target=\"_blank\">Google Meet Attendance</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t know about you, but this fine gentleman up in Canada deserves some major accolades. Not only has he been preparing for a school year of remote learning and working, he has taken the time and energy to invest in his fellow educators. Not only that, he&#8217;s doing it absolutely free and is very active on Facebook ready to take input, feedback and suggestions to improve an already amazing Chrome Extension and classroom tool. If you grab this extension and find it handy or maybe you just want to support someone who invests in the future our children, you can donate to this teacher/developer. You can find the link on the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/GoogleMeetAttendance/\" target=\"_blank\">Extension&#8217;s Facebook page</a> and on the Chrome Web Store in the description. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Google Meet Push To Talk</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Tired of yelling at your students and trying to get them to mute their mics? Make them work to chat with this handy little extension that adds a &#8220;CB radio&#8221; aspect to your video meetings. Google Meet Push to Talk does exactly what the name clearly states. With this extension installed, you have everyone in your meeting mute their mics by default. Then, if you want to speak, you just have to press the space bar. Just like two way radios when we were kids. This won&#8217;t take the place of hand raising or reactions but it&#8217;s a great way to keep the chatter at a minimum and eliminate everyone talking at once. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-meet-push-to-talk/pgpidfocdapogajplhjofamgeboonmmj?hl=en-US\" class=\"BuyButton\" target=\"_blank\">Google Meet Push To Talk</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Update</strong>: <em>I received an email from the CIO of a large school district who pointed out some very useful information about extensions of this nature. While they are very helpful tools, these extensions are not published or supported by Google. These are third-party tools and many of them are developed by teachers wanting to fill a gap in technology. Updates to Google Meet can often times break extensions like these when updates are pushed that cause conflicts that the developers can not foresee. If you are using these extensions and Meet is having issues, you will want to disable the third-party extensions before taking further troubleshooting steps. </em></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"newsletterSignupBlock\">\n\tGet Alerted About New Posts On <br class=\"forMobileOnly\"><span class=\"highlighter\">Your Schedule</span><br>\n\t<a class=\"BuyButton\" href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/newsletter-sign-up/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sign Up For The Official Chrome Unboxed Newsletter</a>\n<div class=\"divider\"></div>\n<h6>Latest Posts</h6>\n<div class=\"wp-rss-template-container\" data-wpra-template=\"default\" data-template-ctx=\"eyJmZWVkcyI6Im5ld2VzdHBvc3RzIn0=\">\n    <div class=\"wp-rss-aggregator wpra-list-template  \" data-page=\"1\">\n    \n    \n<ul class=\"wpra-item-list rss-aggregator \"\n    start=\"1\">\n                        <li class=\"wpra-item feed-item gurss\">\n            \n            \n\n    <a  href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/usi-stylus-pen-affordable-chromebooks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\">Affordable, stowable USI pens will arrive with the next generation of Chromebooks</a>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wprss-feed-meta\">\n    \n    \n    </div>\n\n            \n        </li>\n                    <li class=\"wpra-item feed-item gurss\">\n            \n            \n\n    <a  href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/the-rare-occasion-we-actually-recommend-a-refurbished-chromebook/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\">The rare occasion we actually recommend a refurbished Chromebook</a>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wprss-feed-meta\">\n    \n    \n    </div>\n\n            \n        </li>\n                    <li class=\"wpra-item feed-item gurss\">\n            \n            \n\n    <a  href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/the-chrome-cast-77-an-exclusive-interview-with-usi-chairman-peter-mueller/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\">The Chrome Cast 77: An exclusive interview with USI Chairman Peter Mueller</a>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wprss-feed-meta\">\n    \n    \n    </div>\n\n            \n        </li>\n                    <li class=\"wpra-item feed-item gurss\">\n            \n            \n\n    <a  href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/new-chromebooks-development-volteer-zork-kukui-dedede\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\">Time to add a ton of Chromebooks to the list of upcoming devices</a>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wprss-feed-meta\">\n    \n    \n    </div>\n\n            \n        </li>\n        </ul>\n\n        \n</div>\n\n</div>\n\n</div>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 26 Aug 2020 19:30:14 +0000","feedId":13345,"bgimg":"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/google-meet-nod-hand-raise-1024x576.jpg","linkMd5":"627eef446a90d6fa71ac8c76d7bcad3b","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn34@2020_2/2020/09/05/08-50-11-410_0d217cd9d660f377.webp","destWidth":1024,"destHeight":576,"sourceBytes":33489,"destBytes":20028,"author":"Gabriel Brangers","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/google-meet-nod-hand-raise-1024x576.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn34@2020_2/2020/09/05/08-50-11-410_0d217cd9d660f377.webp","https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Zoom-White-150x150.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn72@2020_6/2020/09/05/08-50-16-494_72294ab93b00c1c1.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599295810956},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:10","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:10","title":"Potential new Pixelbook 2 ‘Halvor’ will come with USB 4.0 and Thunderbolt support","link":"https://chromeunboxed.com/?p=25252","description":"<a href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/google-pixelbook-2-halvor-usb-4-thunderbolt\" title=\"Potential new Pixelbook 2 &#8216;Halvor&#8217;

For one, USB 4.0 will unify USB under one connector: USB Type C.  If it utilizing USB 4.0, it will have the Type C connector.  <strong>No more confusion there.</strong>  Additionally, we&#8217;re looking at 40GB/s transfer speeds, Thunderbolt 3, PD (power deliver for fast charging standards) and backwards compatibility with older USB 3.2 and USB 2.0 protocols.  This is a next-gen connectivity standard we will all come to expect as we move into 2021, so I&#8217;m glad to see &#8216;Halvor&#8217; will come equipped with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Thunderbolt is finally coming to Chromebooks, too</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/chromebooks-thunderbolt-3-support-chrome-os/\" target=\"_blank\">We&#8217;ve talked about Thunderbolt support for Chromebooks</a> on multiple occasions and, honestly, we thought we&#8217;d eventually see it hit a &#8216;Hatch&#8217;-based Chromebook like the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook or Acer Spin 713, but there&#8217;s been no real movement on that front with the current generation of Chromebooks.  Tiger Lake Chromebooks based on the &#8216;Volteer&#8217; baseboard, on the other hand, look set to deliver the benefits of Thunderbolt to Chrome OS and &#8216;Halvor&#8217; definitely looks to be getting in on the action.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The benefits?  Thunderbolt greatly increases data transfer speeds for things like external GPUs and SSDs, but is also plays a very important role in giving Chromebooks a far greater ability to leverage multiple external displays at once.  While not a tool every user is after right now, the additional headroom is definitely welcome on higher-end Chromebooks from a productivity standpoint and, with the addition of both USB 4.0 and Thunderbolt, it appears Google&#8217;s next Chromebook won&#8217;t be at a loss for external data transfer prowess.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/patreonInContentDesktop.jpg\" class=\"patreonDesktop\">\n\n\n\n<div class=\"newsletterSignupBlock\">\n\tGet Alerted About New Posts On <br class=\"forMobileOnly\"><span class=\"highlighter\">Your Schedule</span><br>\n\t<a class=\"BuyButton\" href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/newsletter-sign-up/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sign Up For The Official Chrome Unboxed Newsletter</a>\n<div class=\"divider\"></div>\n<h6>Latest Posts</h6>\n<div class=\"wp-rss-template-container\" data-wpra-template=\"default\" data-template-ctx=\"eyJmZWVkcyI6Im5ld2VzdHBvc3RzIn0=\">\n    <div class=\"wp-rss-aggregator wpra-list-template  \" data-page=\"1\">\n    \n    \n<ul class=\"wpra-item-list rss-aggregator \"\n    start=\"1\">\n                        <li class=\"wpra-item feed-item gurss\">\n            \n            \n\n    <a  href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/usi-stylus-pen-affordable-chromebooks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\">Affordable, stowable USI pens will arrive with the next generation of Chromebooks</a>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wprss-feed-meta\">\n    \n    \n    </div>\n\n            \n        </li>\n                    <li class=\"wpra-item feed-item gurss\">\n            \n            \n\n    <a  href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/the-rare-occasion-we-actually-recommend-a-refurbished-chromebook/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\">The rare occasion we actually recommend a refurbished Chromebook</a>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wprss-feed-meta\">\n    \n    \n    </div>\n\n            \n        </li>\n                    <li class=\"wpra-item feed-item gurss\">\n            \n            \n\n    <a  href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/the-chrome-cast-77-an-exclusive-interview-with-usi-chairman-peter-mueller/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\">The Chrome Cast 77: An exclusive interview with USI Chairman Peter Mueller</a>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wprss-feed-meta\">\n    \n    \n    </div>\n\n            \n        </li>\n                    <li class=\"wpra-item feed-item gurss\">\n            \n            \n\n    <a  href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/new-chromebooks-development-volteer-zork-kukui-dedede\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\">Time to add a ton of Chromebooks to the list of upcoming devices</a>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wprss-feed-meta\">\n    \n    \n    </div>\n\n            \n        </li>\n        </ul>\n\n        \n</div>\n\n</div>\n\n</div>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 03 Sep 2020 15:52:10 +0000","feedId":13345,"bgimg":"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/HalvorGooglePixelbookUSB4Thunderbolt-1024x576.jpg","linkMd5":"f710e9aec384942e10d71ab9d2681142","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn70@2020_2/2020/09/05/08-50-11-425_04c5fb5fe1c4488b.webp","destWidth":1024,"destHeight":576,"sourceBytes":58887,"destBytes":28986,"author":"Robby Payne","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/HalvorGooglePixelbookUSB4Thunderbolt-1024x576.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn70@2020_2/2020/09/05/08-50-11-425_04c5fb5fe1c4488b.webp","https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Halvor-USB-4-Thunderbolt.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn44@2020_5/2020/09/05/08-50-14-439_b772f7880623e4c6.webp","https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/patreonInContentDesktop.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn34@2020_5/2020/09/05/08-50-16-094_3e3fd54965f36783.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599295810954},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:10","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:10","title":"This tweak will help speed up Virtual Desk transitions on Chromebooks","link":"https://chromeunboxed.com/?p=25076","description":"<a href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/chromebook-chrome-os-virtual-desk-speed\" title=\"This tweak will help speed up Virtual Desk transitions on Chromebooks\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/virtualDesksWorkflowChromebookFeature-1024x576.jpg\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"display: block;

The feature has been so solid and great to use that it has become a regular part of my daily workflow and one I have a hard time imagining living without.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It looks like a solid upgrade will be coming to Virtual Desks via a small-but-helpful change for people that like to use these desks as a legitimate productivity tool.  <a href=\"https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/2376418\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">According to this commit from the Chromium Repositories,</a> Virtual Desks are getting an upgrade in the speed department that will allow quick moves between all four desks to happen with much higher rates of speed.  </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>desks: Allow multiple keyboard press to switch desks quickly. </p><p>Second CL to allow chaining keyboard shortcuts. </p><p>Follow up to <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://crrev.com/c/2354798\" target=\"_blank\">crrev.com/c/2354798</a> which allows RootWindowDeskSwitch to handle more than two screenshots. This CL fills it out by handling taking third and fourth screenshots and placing them on the animation layer to get a nice smooth continuous animation. Tests in a follow up.</p><cite><a href=\"https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/2376418\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">via the Chromium Gerrit</a></cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>As it stands right now, if you use the keyboard shortcut to move through your open desks <strong>( SEARCH + [ or ] )</strong>, you&#8217;ll notice you can only move to the next desk once the desk you just jumped to slides fully into view.  Hit that shortcut key before the animation finishes and nothing happens.  What this means is jumping from desk 1 to desk 4 can take a few seconds at best and a tad longer at worst.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If, like me, you use Virtual Desks on a regular basis, this can add up to a lot of wasted time moving through your open desks.  I tend to put the same stuff on my desks every day, so I always know that my music player and related media is always on my 4th desk, for instance, and moving to that desk from my 1st desk (where my primary stuff lives) takes a second or two no matter how I go about doing it.  Not a huge headache, but I can easily see where quicker transitions could go a long way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This upcoming change should allow users to move from desk to desk with much less time between animations, meaning if you are on desk 1 and need to skip right to desk 4, you can hit that keyboard shortcut 3 times in succession and land right on the desk you need without waiting for animations to load each time.  For users that are invested in using Virtual Desks on their Chromebook, this tiny change could go a long way towards saving us all quite a bit of time.  We&#8217;ll be on the lookout for this change to be merged and will give it a try in the Canary Channel as soon as we see it arrive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://chrmshop.com/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"BuyButton\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Shop Best Chromebooks of 2020 So Far on Chrome Shop</a></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"newsletterSignupBlock\">\n\tGet Alerted About New Posts On <br class=\"forMobileOnly\"><span class=\"highlighter\">Your Schedule</span><br>\n\t<a class=\"BuyButton\" href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/newsletter-sign-up/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sign Up For The Official Chrome Unboxed Newsletter</a>\n<div class=\"divider\"></div>\n<h6>Latest Posts</h6>\n<div class=\"wp-rss-template-container\" data-wpra-template=\"default\" data-template-ctx=\"eyJmZWVkcyI6Im5ld2VzdHBvc3RzIn0=\">\n    <div class=\"wp-rss-aggregator wpra-list-template  \" data-page=\"1\">\n    \n    \n<ul class=\"wpra-item-list rss-aggregator \"\n    start=\"1\">\n                        <li class=\"wpra-item feed-item gurss\">\n            \n            \n\n    <a  href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/usi-stylus-pen-affordable-chromebooks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\">Affordable, stowable USI pens will arrive with the next generation of Chromebooks</a>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wprss-feed-meta\">\n    \n    \n    </div>\n\n            \n        </li>\n                    <li class=\"wpra-item feed-item gurss\">\n            \n            \n\n    <a  href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/the-rare-occasion-we-actually-recommend-a-refurbished-chromebook/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\">The rare occasion we actually recommend a refurbished Chromebook</a>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wprss-feed-meta\">\n    \n    \n    </div>\n\n            \n        </li>\n                    <li class=\"wpra-item feed-item gurss\">\n            \n            \n\n    <a  href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/the-chrome-cast-77-an-exclusive-interview-with-usi-chairman-peter-mueller/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\">The Chrome Cast 77: An exclusive interview with USI Chairman Peter Mueller</a>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wprss-feed-meta\">\n    \n    \n    </div>\n\n            \n        </li>\n                    <li class=\"wpra-item feed-item gurss\">\n            \n            \n\n    <a  href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/new-chromebooks-development-volteer-zork-kukui-dedede\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\">Time to add a ton of Chromebooks to the list of upcoming devices</a>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wprss-feed-meta\">\n    \n    \n    </div>\n\n            \n        </li>\n        </ul>\n\n        \n</div>\n\n</div>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 31 Aug 2020 16:19:36 +0000","feedId":13345,"bgimg":"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/virtualDesksWorkflowChromebookFeature-1024x576.jpg","linkMd5":"c93f5d7326409aced30b807c110a1373","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn66@2020_2/2020/09/05/08-50-11-438_6d94833426424095.webp","destWidth":1024,"destHeight":576,"sourceBytes":68798,"destBytes":36152,"author":"Robby Payne","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/virtualDesksWorkflowChromebookFeature-1024x576.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn66@2020_2/2020/09/05/08-50-11-438_6d94833426424095.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599295810955},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:10","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:10","title":"Hands-On: USI pens for Chromebooks are finally arriving and they are awesome [VIDEO]","link":"https://chromeunboxed.com/?p=25054","description":"<a href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/usi-stylus-pen-chromebook-hands-on\" title=\"Hands-On: USI pens for Chromebooks are finally arriving and they are awesome [VIDEO]\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/USIpenChromebook-1024x576.jpg\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"display: block;

In a similar manner to unifying ports under one, universal standard (USB), USI aims to wrangle all the differing, proprietary digital pen technologies into one, unified standard.  That&#8217;s a big undertaking for any organization and part of the reason why after 5 years, we&#8217;re just now getting to the point where we have quite a few devices that can leverage the tech.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/rise-of-the-universal-stylus-usi-emerges-in-upcoming-chromebook-bloog/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">We began tracking USI input on upcoming Chromebooks all the way back in May of 2019</a> and knew that, eventually, we&#8217;d begin seeing some Chromebooks launch with it on board.  What we didn&#8217;t realize is the fact that most Chromebooks launching in 2020 would come equipped with USI capability if they chose to go with pen support.  While Samsung is a participant in the USI movement, they bucked the trend and shipped the Galaxy Chromebook very early in 2020 with their own internal stylus tech (EMR-based).  Apart from them, however, all Chromebooks launched this year that have digital pen support are based on USI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The ASUS Flip C436, HP x360 14c, HP x360 12b, Lenovo Flex 5, Lenovo Duet, Lenovo 10e, and Acer Spin 713</strong> are all big releases for 2020 that lean on the USI tech to offer users a pen experience.  <strong>The problem?</strong>  Up to this point, there have simply been no pens available for anyone to go and buy.  Pair that up with the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/the-chrome-cast-episode-69-interview-john-maletis-chrome-os-head-ux/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"19901\" target=\"_blank\">massive Chromebook growth we&#8217;ve seen across the board in 2020</a> and you have a large audience hungry for pens that have simply been non-existent up to this point.  It&#8217;s been a bit of bad timing, for sure, but it finally seems we&#8217;re on the other side of the issue as <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/certified-usi-universal-stylus-initiative-available-iplume-chromebook-compatible\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"25015\" target=\"_blank\">3rd-party USI pens have begun to show up here and there,</a> signaling an end to the USI pen drought.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Hands-On: USI Pens for Chromebooks are Finally Arriving\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0x-ekbCOOIg?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Testing one of many USI pens</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve recently had the opportunity to have a chat with the Chairman of USI &#8211; Peter Mueller &#8211; and we are excited about having him on the podcast this week, but as a part of that chat came the chance to finally get our hands on a few working, real-world USI pens being made by 3rd-party ODMs.  Specifically, the pen we have in the office is made by Waltop for a variety of resellers and is the <a href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/certified-usi-universal-stylus-initiative-available-iplume-chromebook-compatible\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"25015\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">exact same pen we came across recently on Amazon being sold and branded as iPlume.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting this pen in the office allowed us to finally test a working, production-level USI pen on a few Chromebooks we have around and, <strong>you know what?  These pens are legit.</strong>  Not only does the all-aluminum casing feel premium, the input lag is fantastic (even on the slowest USI Chromebook in the Lenovo Duet), the pressure sensitivity is responsive, and the feel of the pen on the screen is satisfying as well.  There was no need to pair the pen up or go through any setup processes: it simply jumped between all the USI-compatible Chromebooks we have around without even a hiccup.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"crp_related crp_related_block  \"><h5>more from Chrome Unboxed</h5><ul><li><a href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/amd-chromebook-zork-usi-stylus-pen-internal-charge/\"    target=\"_blank\"  class=\"post-19809\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  width=\"150\" height=\"150\"  src=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/AMDchromebooksCES2020-150x150.jpg\" class=\"crp_thumb crp_featured\" alt=\"Upcoming AMD-powered Chromebooks will internally stow and charge a USI stylus\" title=\"Upcoming AMD-powered Chromebooks will internally stow and charge a USI stylus\" /><span class=\"crp_title\">Upcoming AMD-powered Chromebooks will internally stow and charge a USI stylus</span></a><span class=\"crp_author\">  by <a href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/author/robbypayne/\">Robby Payne</a></span> </li></ul><div class=\"crp_clear\"></div></div>\n\n\n<p>This pen &#8211; and the others like it that are finally coming to market &#8211; is as good as any first-party pen on any Chromebook I&#8217;ve tested, and <strong>I&#8217;m so thrilled to be able to say that.</strong>  Our only USI pen experience has been with a pre-production HP pen that, frankly, hasn&#8217;t been great.  Up to this point, we were honestly unsure if the fault was with the pen or with the USI standard, but we can confidently tell you that USI is for real and pens that are built correctly work like a charm on any Chromebook you use them with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope you have a moment to watch the video we made on this because I can only tell you so much: watching brings it to life.  <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://universalstylus.org/members/\" target=\"_blank\">With so many big names on board with the USI pen efforts,</a> we can realistically see a near-term future when there are tons of USI pens to choose from and tons of laptops that utilize the universally-adopted tech.  It&#8217;s one thing to have a standard that just works; <strong>it&#8217;s a much bigger deal to have a universal standard that works well and is actually great to use in practice.</strong>  If you&#8217;ve purchased a Chromebook this year with the hopes of choosing the pen that you want for it, the time is finally arriving where that is going to be an option, and the end result will be a fantastic inking experience for everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://chrmshop.com/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"BuyButton\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Shop Best Chromebooks of 2020 So Far on Chrome Shop</a></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"newsletterSignupBlock\">\n\tGet Alerted About New Posts On <br class=\"forMobileOnly\"><span class=\"highlighter\">Your Schedule</span><br>\n\t<a class=\"BuyButton\" href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/newsletter-sign-up/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sign Up For The Official Chrome Unboxed Newsletter</a>\n<div class=\"divider\"></div>\n<h6>Latest Posts</h6>\n<div class=\"wp-rss-template-container\" data-wpra-template=\"default\" data-template-ctx=\"eyJmZWVkcyI6Im5ld2VzdHBvc3RzIn0=\">\n    <div class=\"wp-rss-aggregator wpra-list-template  \" data-page=\"1\">\n    \n    \n<ul class=\"wpra-item-list rss-aggregator \"\n    start=\"1\">\n                        <li class=\"wpra-item feed-item gurss\">\n            \n            \n\n    <a  href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/usi-stylus-pen-affordable-chromebooks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\">Affordable, stowable USI pens will arrive with the next generation of Chromebooks</a>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wprss-feed-meta\">\n    \n    \n    </div>\n\n            \n        </li>\n                    <li class=\"wpra-item feed-item gurss\">\n            \n            \n\n    <a  href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/the-rare-occasion-we-actually-recommend-a-refurbished-chromebook/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\">The rare occasion we actually recommend a refurbished Chromebook</a>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wprss-feed-meta\">\n    \n    \n    </div>\n\n            \n        </li>\n                    <li class=\"wpra-item feed-item gurss\">\n            \n            \n\n    <a  href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/the-chrome-cast-77-an-exclusive-interview-with-usi-chairman-peter-mueller/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\">The Chrome Cast 77: An exclusive interview with USI Chairman Peter Mueller</a>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wprss-feed-meta\">\n    \n    \n    </div>\n\n            \n        </li>\n                    <li class=\"wpra-item feed-item gurss\">\n            \n            \n\n    <a  href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/new-chromebooks-development-volteer-zork-kukui-dedede\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\">Time to add a ton of Chromebooks to the list of upcoming devices</a>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wprss-feed-meta\">\n    \n    \n    </div>\n\n            \n        </li>\n        </ul>\n\n        \n</div>\n\n</div>\n\n</div>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 30 Aug 2020 16:26:10 +0000","feedId":13345,"bgimg":"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/USIpenChromebook-1024x576.jpg","linkMd5":"4c8b2094acea890fb368f08d261fe810","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn21@2020_6/2020/09/05/08-50-11-450_fcfae64eaf4e6555.webp","destWidth":1024,"destHeight":576,"sourceBytes":48747,"destBytes":25316,"author":"Robby Payne","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/USIpenChromebook-1024x576.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn21@2020_6/2020/09/05/08-50-11-450_fcfae64eaf4e6555.webp","https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/AMDchromebooksCES2020-150x150.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn4@2020_2/2020/09/05/08-50-47-730_3bba4c69dd2019b2.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599295810955},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:10","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:10","title":"CTL debuts company-first 14-inch FHD Pentium Chromebook","link":"https://chromeunboxed.com/?p=25099","description":"<a href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/ctl-debuts-company-first-14-inch-fhd-pentium-chromebook/\" title=\"CTL debuts company-first 14-inch FHD Pentium Chromebook\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ctl-nl81-14-chromebook-1024x576.jpg\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"display: block;

If you&#8217;ve looked around the web in an attempt to find a decent device at a price that doesn&#8217;t induce a stroke, you probably know exactly what I&#8217;m talking about. As of this morning, Best Buy had less than six Chromebook models in stock and three of those were variants of the Pixelbook Go. While most manufacturers are working diligently to get new models into the market, it looks like late fall is going to be the earliest we see most devices back in stock on a regular basis. CTL has been at the mercy of high demand and short supply like everyone else but that hasn&#8217;t stopped the Oregon-base Chromebook maker from getting some new products in the pipeline.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a company first, CTL has debuted two 14&#8243; Chromebooks and these devices are looking to shake up the mid-range Chrome OS market thanks to some impressive specs with a very palatable price tag. For starters, CTL&#8217;s base model 14&#8243; Chromebook comes out of the gate with a Full HD display which is not the norm when we&#8217;re talking EDU devices. Both devices feature Intel Gemini Lake-R CPUs that boasts processing power that&#8217;s more than ample for the majority of users. I&#8217;m not just talking about your middle school student, either. We&#8217;ll talk a little more about that in a second. For now, let&#8217;s take a look at the new Chromebooks from CTL. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>CTL Chromebook NL81</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The entry-level 14&#8243; Chromebook NL81 features a Full HD anti-glare panel which should make for a great workspace. It is powered by the dual-core Intel Gemini Lake-R N4020 which we have seen in a handful of devices as of late. As you can see in <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/lenovo-chromebook-ideapad-3-review-cheap-good-review/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"19638\" target=\"_blank\">our review of the Lenovo Chromebook 3</a>, this small core CPU is a workhorse and will chew threw anything the average user can throw at it. This model is paired with 4GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. It&#8217;s a bit scant on that end but let&#8217;s remember, this is and EDU device. 4GB is still enough when used in conjunction with a decent processor. For the storage, you do get a MicroSD card slot and of course, you have Google Drive right there in your files app. Moving on. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As with all CTL Chromebooks, this model features its own share of rugged specifications. The keyboard is spill-resistant and the keys are anti-peel. We&#8217;ll have to get our hands on the NL81 to see just how tough it is but CTL does state that it is drop-tested with an IP rating and a non-slip design. Oh yeah, it also has Bluetooth 5 and Gigabit Wi-Fi. It&#8217;s not quite a zippy as Wi-Fi 6 but I doubt you&#8217;ll notice. Here&#8217;s a closer look at the CTL Chromebook NL81: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Chrome OS</strong></li><li><strong>Processor</strong>: Intel Gemini Lake R N4020</li><li><strong>RAM:</strong>&#160;4GB LPDDR4</li><li><strong>Storage:</strong>&#160;32GB eMMC</li><li><strong>Camera:</strong>&#160;HD 720P with LED indicator</li><li><strong>GPU:</strong>&#160;Intel® UMA GLK-R&#160;Integrated Graphics</li><li><strong>Display:</strong>&#160;16:9 14&#8243; 1920 X 1080p FHD LED Anti-Glare</li><li><strong>Ports:&#160;</strong>2x USB 3.0, 2x USB-C with PD function, 2-in-1 SD/MMC Card Reader, Audio Combo Jack</li><li><strong>Audio:&#160;</strong>Single Digital Microphone</li><li><strong>WLAN</strong>:&#160;WL/BT 802.11ABGN/AC 9560.NGWG.NV, Intel® 9560 Wireless, MU-MIMO support</li><li><strong>AUE June 2026</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s the best part of this device. It is available for pre-order for the discounted price of $279. The MSRP will eventually be $349 but I&#8217;d argue that you&#8217;d be hard-pressed to find another device, available or not, that carries this kind of price tag and offers this much in the way of specs. For reference, Acer&#8217;s Chromebook 314 has a 1366&#215;768 panel, the older N4000 CPU, and retails for $249. You may not think it would make a big difference but believe me, your eyes will appreciate having a FullHD panel and the performance boost of the N4020 is worth the extra few bucks, in my opinion. The Chromebook NL81 won&#8217;t ship until Nov/Dec but pre-orders are up and you will snag that discount if you reserve now. I know that doesn&#8217;t help if you need a Chromebook right now but this will be a great option for schools looking to boost their laptop fleets as we round out 2020. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a

This processor puts up Octane scores over 21,000 in devices that we have tested and this Chromebook gets the added boost of 8GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. It features the same rugged specs and generous port selection. Acer&#8217;s comparable model will retail for $429 but CTL is listing the NL81T for only $379 and you&#8217;re getting the exact same performance on top of the durability that CTL is known for in its Chromebooks. Pre-orders are open and the Chromebook NL81T will ship in late November or early December. We&#8217;ll get these in the office ASAP and let you know if the CTL NL81 will be the Chromebook to beat in this segment. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Chrome

have never heard about it, or are itching to know more, you really need to tune in for this episode of The Chrome Cast.  We were fortunate enough to have a fantastic and detailed conversation about the history, current status, and future of USI with none other than the <a href=\"https://universalstylus.org/board-of-directors/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Chairman of the Board for USI, Peter Mueller.</a>  Through a series of questions and discussion, Peter talks in depth about the technology that drives this new stylus standard and why it is the folks behind USI hope it can become the single, standardized stylus protocol for nearly all tech gadgets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We had a preliminary call with Pete before setting up the podcast recording and even though I knew quite a bit about USI going into today&#8217;s episode, I still left our discussion even more excited by the potential of USI pens across all aspects of the tech community.  We sincerely hope you enjoy this episode as much as we did making it.</p>\n\n\n\n<iframe class=\"podcst\"

data-large-file=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GoogleChromebookDevelopmentBoards-1024x576.jpg\" /></a>\n<p>I remember a day when finding one new Chromebook development board was cause for celebration and excitement.  I remember the thrill of the hunt and the days following a new find, filled with digging and questions around what this new Chromebook would end up becoming.  Those were simpler days and we always knew there would come a time when the number of Chromebooks in development would make it nearly impossible to keep tabs on them all.  <strong>We&#8217;re in that future, now, and the sheer volume of new Chromebooks in development is simply unprecedented.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have a post that I&#8217;d recommend you bookmark if you like keeping up with this kind of thing.  As we find new devices in development, <a href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/chromebooks-upcoming-development-boards-devices-chrome-os/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"18348\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">we add them to that single post</a> and try to keep it as updated as possible.  From that single page, you can see all the devices we are keeping an eye on and get a better feel for the absolute mess of Chromebooks that are coming to market in the coming months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For this post, however, I want to shine a light on a few newer devices we&#8217;ve come across while scouring the Chromium Repositories in search of new features and other Chrome OS goodies.  Like other devices we come across, we know very little about these Chromebooks apart from what baseboard they are built on at this point.  For some of them, details will end up surfacing over time and for others, we won&#8217;t know any other finer points until the device shows up in our office.  It&#8217;s just the way of things and when compared to only having a new board here or there to talk about, I&#8217;d rather be in the midst of this current deluge.  <strong>With that, let&#8217;s look at what&#8217;s new.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New &#8216;Volteer&#8217; Chromebooks</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The current bell of the ball is &#8216;Volteer&#8217; and the 11th-gen Tiger Lake chips devices built on this baseboard will contain.  These devices will have the option of USB 4.0, Thunderbolt, Intel&#8217;s new Xe GPU, and enhanced performance/battery life.  Just like the current &#8216;Hatch&#8217; Chromebooks we&#8217;ve watched launch in 2020 (Samsung Galaxy Chromebook, Acer Chromebook Spin 713, etc.), &#8216;Volteer&#8217; Chromebooks may show up late in 2020 and will dominate the release cycles in 2021.  Here are the new ones:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromiumos/platform/ec/+/2297074\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">&#8216;Lingcod&#8217;</a></li><li><a href=\"https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromiumos/platform/ec/+/2309512\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">&#8216;Lindar&#8217;</a></li><li><a href=\"https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromiumos/platform/ec/+/2327361\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">&#8216;Todor&#8217;</a></li><li><a href=\"https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromiumos/platform/ec/+/2321809\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">&#8216;Eldrid&#8217;</a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>New &#8216;Zork&#8217; Chromebooks</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The other big development category right now is the group of devices based on &#8216;Zork&#8217;.  These Chromebooks will be distinctive in the fact that they possess flagship-level AMD APUs that combine powerful AMD chips with Ryzen GPUs.  While we&#8217;ve had a handful of AMD A4 and A6 Chromebooks, the processors inside were budget and meant for affordable devices.  These &#8216;Zork&#8217; boards are meant for bigger, better things and we&#8217;re very excited to see them begin to arrive as the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/steam-games-chrome-os-chromebooks-web-install-app-manager\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"25260\" target=\"_blank\">movement on Steam gaming for Chromebooks is accelerating.</a>  Here are the newest additions:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromiumos/platform/ec/+/2306889\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">&#8216;Dirinboz&#8217;</a></li><li><a href=\"https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromiumos/platform/ec/+/2214445\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">&#8216;Woomax&#8217;</a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>New &#8216;Kukui&#8217; Chromebooks</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8216;Kukui&#8217; Chromebooks bring things back to 2020 development and are responsible for devices like the Lenovo Chromebook Duet and 10e.  Those devices only scratch the surface of what we&#8217;re expecting to see in the affordable Chromebook category from this baseboard.  There are many &#8216;Kukui&#8217; boards that have been in the works for quite some time and we&#8217;re adding a few more to the mix:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromiumos/platform/ec/+/2319495\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">&#8216;Willow&#8217;</a></li><li><a href=\"https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromiumos/platform/ec/+/2319498\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">&#8216;Burnet&#8217;</a></li><li><a href=\"https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromiumos/platform/ec/+/2319499\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">&#8216;Esche&#8217;</a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>New &#8216;Dedede&#8217; Chromebooks</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, our &#8216;Dedede&#8217; family is based on the upcoming Jasper Lake chip set from Intel.  These new chips may not be as flashy as the Tiger Lake chips that are pushing flagship machines, but their smaller process (10nm) and increased speed and graphics will make them awesome chips for mid-range Chromebooks.  The current crop of Gemini Lake Chromebooks are impressive in their battery life and performance at low prices, so we&#8217;d expect even better cost/performance ratios with Jasper Lake when they arrive.

That said, there are a number of reasons why one would want to update, change, or reset a Chromebook password. Thankfully, your Chromebook password is tied directly to your Google account and the credentials are one and the same. Perhaps you&#8217;re like millions of users whose email accounts have fallen victim to an unfortunate data breach. Maybe you&#8217;re like me and it&#8217;s just time to update your password for the sake of security. In another, all too familiar scenario, you may have lost or forgotten your account password and you need to reset it to regain access to your Google services. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, we&#8217;re going to take a look at the proper methods to change and/or reset your Google password depending on your specific situation. We&#8217;ll start with the easiest scenario and then, move on to the more sticky implementations of changing your password. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you simply want to change your login password for your Chromebook, you just have to update the password associated with the Google account that you use to log in. This is best done from the Chromebook you use regularly. This method takes presumes that you know your current Google password. To begin, open up a New Tab Page on your Chromebook. If you have a custom New Tab Page, you can just go to Google or any of your connected Google services such as Gmail or Google Drive. At the top-right corner, you should see your profile picture. Click the photo and select &#8220;Manage your Google account.&#8221; It will be the one directly below your photo, not the one at the bottom of the dropdown. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped\"><ul data-carousel-extra='{\"blog_id\":1,\"permalink\":\"https:\\/\\/chromeunboxed.com\\/how-to-reset-the-password-on-your-chromebook-the-right-way\\/\"}' class=\"blocks-gallery-grid\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><a href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Untitled-1-3.png\"><img data-attachment-id=\"25144\" data-permalink=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/how-to-reset-the-password-on-your-chromebook-the-right-way/untitled-1-3-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Untitled-1-3.png\" data-orig-size=\"1366,751\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&#34;aperture&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;credit&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;camera&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;caption&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;created_timestamp&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;copyright&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;focal_length&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;iso&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;shutter_speed&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;title&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;orientation&#34;:&#34;0&#34;}\" data-image-title=\"Untitled-1-3\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Untitled-1-3-300x165.png\" data-large-file=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Untitled-1-3-1024x563.png\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"563\" src=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Untitled-1-3-1024x563.png\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"25144\" data-full-url=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Untitled-1-3.png\" data-link=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/?attachment_id=25144\" class=\"wp-image-25144\" srcset=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Untitled-1-3-1024x563.png 1024w, https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Untitled-1-3-300x165.png 300w, https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Untitled-1-3-768x422.png 768w, https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Untitled-1-3.png 1366w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><a href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Untitled-1-4.png\"><img data-attachment-id=\"25145\" data-permalink=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/how-to-reset-the-password-on-your-chromebook-the-right-way/untitled-1-4-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Untitled-1-4.png\" data-orig-size=\"1200,391\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&#34;aperture&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;credit&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;camera&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;caption&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;created_timestamp&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;copyright&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;focal_length&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;iso&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;shutter_speed&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;title&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;orientation&#34;:&#34;0&#34;}\" data-image-title=\"Untitled-1 (4)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Untitled-1-4-300x98.png\" data-large-file=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Untitled-1-4-1024x334.png\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"334\" src=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Untitled-1-4-1024x334.png\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"25145\" data-full-url=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Untitled-1-4.png\" data-link=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/?attachment_id=25145\" class=\"wp-image-25145\" srcset=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Untitled-1-4-1024x334.png 1024w, https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Untitled-1-4-300x98.png 300w, https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Untitled-1-4-768x250.png 768w, https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Untitled-1-4.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></figure></li></ul></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have multiple accounts logged into your device, double-check to make sure that you are headed to the account you wish to update.

Now you can set your new Google password. <em><strong>Note</strong>: This will require you to sign in with the new password on any device that uses your Google account. That means your phone, PCs that you use with Chrome, and any smart devices that are linked to your Google account may need to be updated with the new password.</em> Once you&#8217;ve saved your new password, there is one last step. Close your tabs and any apps you may have open. Now, power down the Chromebook. This will update the TPM with the new password and you&#8217;re all set. If you&#8217;re like us, you might have more than one Chromebook around the house. Now would be a good time to go ahead and update the password on those devices. To do this, you will need to log into the other devices with the old password. Once you&#8217;ve done that, Chrome OS should prompt you to update your credentials and sign in again. It&#8217;s best to do this sooner than later so you don&#8217;t forget your old password and lock yourself out of a device. That leads us to the next scenario that would have you reset your password. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Lost or forgotten</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the event you forget your Google password, I have good news and bad news. In most cases, you can reset the password to your Google account. Unfortunately, your Chrome OS device can only be accessed with the password that you have forgotten. This is why it is imperative that you keep important data and <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/backup-and-restore-your-chromebooks-linux-setup/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"25047\" target=\"_blank\">files backed up</a> to your Google Drive account, external storage, or some other form of off-device storage. Most Android app data is synced to your Google Play account so that&#8217;s not a real concern but any saved files from the web, documents, applications (Android or Linux) or anything else will be lost forever if it is only saved locally on your device and you have lost your password. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have data saved that you absolutely do not wish to lose, make sure you have a sure-fire way to remember your password. That said, there are some instances where you simply can&#8217;t remember your password. If that is the case, logging back into your Chromebook will require a powerwash. This process will completely erase any data on the device. That includes any other accounts that may be logged into the Chromebook. As you can see, you want to avoid this path unless you have absolutely no other alternative. To get started, you will need access to a PC or even the guest mode on a Chromebook.

If you want to try an old password, go ahead. You may luck out and the process will continue. If you can&#8217;t think of one, select &#8220;try another way&#8221; and see what options you have. If you have a recovery email, you will be able to send a link to the other email that will let you reset your password. If you have set up 2FA with your Android device, you can choose to verify it with your phone. You will receive a notification on your mobile device asking for confirmation. Hit yes on your phone and your browser should forward you to the page where you can set up your new password. Save that and close your browser. This would be a good time to point out that your Google Account offers a number of ways to back up and recover your account. You should have that setup. Just sayin&#8217;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, it&#8217;s time to turn to your locked Chromebook. If you&#8217;re logged into your Chromebook, you can powerwash from the settings menu. Sadly, you can&#8217;t log in. If you could, you probably wouldn&#8217;t be reading this. Instead, we&#8217;ll have to do some keyboard gymnastics to reset your device. <strong>Remember, this will delete all data on your device. It will be reset to factory settings.</strong> To reset your device, make sure all users are logged out. from the sign-in screen, press the keys <strong>CTRL+SHIFT+ALT+R</strong>. The powerwash screen will pop up and prompt you to confirm the reset. The device will then restart on go through the reset process. Once it is finished, you will be able to log in with your Google Account and newly updated password. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a managed device from work or school, these methods do not necessarily work. You will need to contact your IT Admin to see what steps you will need to take in order to reset or recover your password. We will cover those various methods at another time. For now, I hope this helps get you back up and running sooner than later. </p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 01 Sep 2020 18:48:20 +0000","feedId":13345,"bgimg":"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/change-your-password-chromebook.jpg","linkMd5":"b15a25383b14859a76a604113ecf28a9","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn26@2020_3/2020/09/05/08-50-11-628_c9dd47830af22981.webp","destWidth":1024,"destHeight":614,"sourceBytes":28364,"destBytes":16286,"author":"Gabriel Brangers","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/change-your-password-chromebook.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn26@2020_3/2020/09/05/08-50-11-628_c9dd47830af22981.webp","https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Untitled-1-3-1024x563.png":null,"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Untitled-1-4-1024x334.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn80@2020_1/2020/09/05/08-50-14-470_ba5098848a2d010a.webp","https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Untitled-1-5-1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn37@2020_1/2020/09/05/08-50-15-769_973b89828a035e0a.webp","https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Untitled-1-6.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn60@2020_6/2020/09/05/08-50-14-649_94107f467bfce407.webp","https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/google-forgot-password-1024x555.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn52@2020_5/2020/09/05/08-50-14-686_bd5d53f39041c1c7.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599295810955},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:10","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:10","title":"Surprise!

As we had hoped, there are some unannounced features that came along for the ride and one of them blind-sided me this morning. Developers have been <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/printing-scanning-management-app-chromebook/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"15936\" target=\"_blank\">working on print management for Chrome OS</a> off and on over the past few months but I didn&#8217;t think that the feature was anywhere near ready for primetime. <strong>I was wrong. </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As one of our <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/patreon-community-launch-chrome-unboxed\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"25162\" target=\"_blank\">fellow Chromies pointed out in our Discord chat</a>, Chrome OS 85 added a new app to the launcher called &#8220;Print Jobs.&#8221; Originally branded &#8220;print management app,&#8221; the new feature appears to be a system web app and was recently updated to Print Jobs last month. As you&#8217;d expect, this app will give you a hub for viewing active and historical print jobs. There&#8217;s not a lot going on here at the moment but it does show active and past print jobs. During an active printing session, I was able to cancel the print job which is exactly what you&#8217;d expect this app to do. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img data-attachment-id=\"25223\" data-permalink=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/surprise-chrome-os-85-brings-print-jobs-management-app/screenshot-2020-09-02-at-12-13-02-pm/\" data-orig-file=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot-2020-09-02-at-12.13.02-PM.png\" data-orig-size=\"1043,401\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&#34;aperture&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;credit&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;camera&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;caption&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;created_timestamp&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;copyright&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;focal_length&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;iso&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;shutter_speed&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;title&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;orientation&#34;:&#34;0&#34;}\" data-image-title=\"Screenshot-2020-09-02-at-12.13.02-PM\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot-2020-09-02-at-12.13.02-PM-300x115.png\" data-large-file=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot-2020-09-02-at-12.13.02-PM-1024x394.png\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"394\" src=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot-2020-09-02-at-12.13.02-PM-1024x394.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-25223\" srcset=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot-2020-09-02-at-12.13.02-PM-1024x394.png 1024w, https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot-2020-09-02-at-12.13.02-PM-300x115.png 300w, https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot-2020-09-02-at-12.13.02-PM-768x295.png 768w, https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot-2020-09-02-at-12.13.02-PM.png 1043w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>As I said, we weren&#8217;t expecting to see a print management app in this update but it looks like developers were ready to get this one out the door. This builds on the ongoing updates to Chrome OS&#8217; ability to print with ease. Chromebooks are gaining network access to a wide number of printer types through this evolving process and Print Jobs is a small, albeit important piece to that puzzle. This will be a welcome change for long-time Chromebook users who were once cursed with the inability to install whatever printer they wanted. It will also be a necessary update when Cloud printing finally gets<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/google-cloud-print-shut-down-december-2020/\" target=\"_blank\"> laid to rest in December of 2020</a>. In related news, Chrome OS Canary now lists a &#8220;scanning&#8221; app that should, eventually, allow users to scan directly from their devices without the need to install an app or <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/chromebook-how-to-scan-with-hp-all-in-one-printers/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"2822\" target=\"_blank\">navigate to a web address like you can with HP and other printers.</a>  If you haven&#8217;t discovered the Print Jobs app yet, make sure you&#8217;ve updated to Chrome OS 85 and search the app launcher for &#8220;print jobs.&#8221; I&#8217;m excited to see what other features may be added to this system app in the future. It has definitely been a long time coming. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"newsletterSignupBlock\">\n\tGet Alerted About New Posts On <br class=\"forMobileOnly\"><span class=\"highlighter\">Your Schedule</span><br>\n\t<a class=\"BuyButton\" href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/newsletter-sign-up/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sign Up For The Official Chrome Unboxed Newsletter</a>\n<div class=\"divider\"></div>\n<h6>Latest Posts</h6>\n<div class=\"wp-rss-template-container\" data-wpra-template=\"default\" data-template-ctx=\"eyJmZWVkcyI6Im5ld2VzdHBvc3RzIn0=\">\n    <div class=\"wp-rss-aggregator wpra-list-template  \" data-page=\"1\">\n    \n    \n<ul class=\"wpra-item-list rss-aggregator \"\n    start=\"1\">\n                        <li class=\"wpra-item feed-item gurss\">\n            \n            \n\n    <a  href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/usi-stylus-pen-affordable-chromebooks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\">Affordable, stowable USI pens will arrive with the next generation of Chromebooks</a>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wprss-feed-meta\">\n    \n    \n    </div>\n\n            \n        </li>\n                    <li class=\"wpra-item feed-item gurss\">\n            \n            \n\n    <a  href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/the-rare-occasion-we-actually-recommend-a-refurbished-chromebook/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\">The rare occasion we actually recommend a refurbished Chromebook</a>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wprss-feed-meta\">\n    \n    \n    </div>\n\n            \n        </li>\n                    <li class=\"wpra-item feed-item gurss\">\n            \n            \n\n    <a  href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/the-chrome-cast-77-an-exclusive-interview-with-usi-chairman-peter-mueller/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\">The Chrome Cast 77: An exclusive interview with USI Chairman Peter Mueller</a>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wprss-feed-meta\">\n    \n    \n    </div>\n\n            \n        </li>\n                    <li class=\"wpra-item feed-item gurss\">\n            \n            \n\n    <a  href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/new-chromebooks-development-volteer-zork-kukui-dedede\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\">Time to add a ton of Chromebooks to the list of upcoming devices</a>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wprss-feed-meta\">\n    \n    \n    </div>\n\n            \n        </li>\n        </ul>\n\n        \n</div>\n\n</div>\n\n</div>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Sep 2020 18:12:50 +0000","feedId":13345,"bgimg":"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/chrome-os-management-print-jobs-1024x576.jpg","linkMd5":"44d2ac424a06edccd0df64ba3a31ae3b","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn85@2020_6/2020/09/05/08-50-11-569_606f206d80322e7f.webp","destWidth":1024,"destHeight":576,"sourceBytes":15074,"destBytes":3878,"author":"Gabriel Brangers","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/chrome-os-management-print-jobs-1024x576.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn85@2020_6/2020/09/05/08-50-11-569_606f206d80322e7f.webp","https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot-2020-09-02-at-12.13.02-PM-1024x394.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn23@2020_6/2020/09/05/08-50-14-501_019854d8c745926b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599295810954},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:10","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:10","title":"Fitbit is officially bringing Google Assistant to your wrist with two new watches","link":"https://chromeunboxed.com/?p=24885","description":"<a href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/fitbit-google-assistant-smartwatch-versa-3-sense\" title=\"Fitbit is officially bringing Google Assistant to your wrist with two new watches\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/fitbitSenseVersa3GoogleAssistant-1024x576.jpg\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"display: block;

As a Google user and an Assistant user, I leave the Alexa functionality on my Fitbit 2 turned off completely.  There are times where I could see some serious upside to having quick access to voice-enabled functions on my wrist, but not enough to wade into the Amazon waters of virtual assistants when I don&#8217;t really do much at all in Amazon&#8217;s current ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With this new option of Google Assistant at the ready on my wrist, I&#8217;m far more compelled to actually seek out virtual help from a smartwatch for more than just replies to text and instant messages.  Being able to queue up direction in Google Maps, check the weather, set reminders, create calendar events, set timers, set alarms, etc. will all become normal fare for me if I have a watch that uses the Assistant.  <strong>And before you say it, yes I know there are a myriad of WearOS watches out there</strong> that have access to the Assistant, but I&#8217;ve known too many friends who have tried and hated their WearOS watches to ever really consider buying one for myself.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"A New Era of Innovation: Fitbit Sense\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lJg1-lPmxMI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div><figcaption>Fitbit Sense promo</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Introducing Fitbit Versa 3\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/IHx_bL3YQLc?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div><figcaption>Fitbit Versa 3 promo</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n<div class=\"crp_related crp_related_block  \"><h5>more from Chrome Unboxed</h5><ul><li><a href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/fitbit-versa-2-google-assistant/\"    target=\"_blank\"  class=\"post-19056\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  width=\"150\" height=\"150\"  src=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/GoogleAssistantFitbitVersa2-150x150.jpg\" class=\"crp_thumb crp_featured\" alt=\"After buying Fitbit 7 months ago, Google is bringing the Assistant to the Versa 2\" title=\"After buying Fitbit 7 months ago, Google is bringing the Assistant to the Versa 2\" /><span class=\"crp_title\">After buying Fitbit 7 months ago, Google is bringing the Assistant to the Versa 2</span></a><span class=\"crp_author\">  by <a href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/author/robbypayne/\">Robby Payne</a></span> </li></ul><div class=\"crp_clear\"></div></div>\n\n\n<p>With both the Fitbit Versa and Versa 2 that I have owned, I&#8217;ve appreciated the simplicity, health tracking, battery life and very low weight of the watches more than anything.  As the versions have progressed, Fitbit just keeps getting better at design and their watches keep adding useful features that users actually need and want.  <strong>With the Versa 3 we get the addition of GPS in the watch and with the Fitbit Sense, we&#8217;re getting a ton of new, handy features like an ECG monitor, skin temp sensor, and a speaker for taking/making calls right on your wrist.</strong>  The Versa 3 will come in at $229.95 and the Sense will run $329.95.  Both are up for pre-order right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the regulatory steps still need to be cleared for Fitbit to become an official Google company, it will be great to have a direct path to the Google Assistant inside an already-great smartwatch experience while we await news of the deal actually going through.  For users like myself, the Fitbit Versa 2 has been a fantastic companion device that does all the basic things I really need in a smartwatch.  From the looks of these newer models, the Fitbit Versa 3 and Fitbit Sense will simply take that winning formula, add on a few niceties, and bring Google a tad bit more into the conversation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://chrmshop.com/fitbit-sense-versa-3/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"BuyButton\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Shop Fitbit Sense &#38;

The work/learn from home movement has hit large and small PC-makers alike and currently, there is an estimated Chromebook shortage of nearly 5 million units that are needed to equip students and workers. Everywhere you look, Chromebooks are back-ordered, sold out or &#8220;coming soon&#8221; but that&#8217;s no help to those who need a device and need it today.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Lenovo Chromebook Duet Review: Unreal Value\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GgJ-1qPM3FY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Thankfully, one of the most popular and most versatile devices to hit the market in 2020 is back in stock at Best Buy but you can guarantee it won&#8217;t be there for long. The Lenovo Chromebook Duet isn&#8217;t the most powerful device on the market but what it does offer is a resume full of premium features and a price tag that&#8217;s outright one of the best deals around. Lenovo quickly sold out of the 64GB variant and Walmart has listed the same model sporadically but you can only pick it up in-store at the moment. The only other option is to grab it from Amazon and pay $100 or more over the suggested retail price of $250-$280. Best Buy, however, has a store-exclusive 128GB model that&#8217;s only $299 which makes it the better bargain an you can have the unassuming 2-in-1 shipped to your local store and in your hands as early as next week. Check out the Lenovo Chromebook Duet from Best Buy at the link below but don&#8217;t dilly dally. We&#8217;ve seen this model and many others sell out within hours and who knows when it will return this time around. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://fave.co/3icTgfp\" class=\"BuyButton\" target=\"_blank\">Lenovo Chromebook Duet at Best Buy</a></p>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"newsletterSignupBlock\">\n\tGet Alerted About New Posts On <br class=\"forMobileOnly\"><span class=\"highlighter\">Your Schedule</span><br>\n\t<a class=\"BuyButton\" href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/newsletter-sign-up/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sign Up For The Official Chrome Unboxed Newsletter</a>\n<div class=\"divider\"></div>\n<h6>Latest Posts</h6>\n<div class=\"wp-rss-template-container\" data-wpra-template=\"default\" data-template-ctx=\"eyJmZWVkcyI6Im5ld2VzdHBvc3RzIn0=\">\n    <div class=\"wp-rss-aggregator wpra-list-template  \" data-page=\"1\">\n    \n    \n<ul class=\"wpra-item-list rss-aggregator \"\n    start=\"1\">\n                        <li class=\"wpra-item feed-item gurss\">\n            \n            \n\n    <a  href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/usi-stylus-pen-affordable-chromebooks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\">Affordable, stowable USI pens will arrive with the next generation of Chromebooks</a>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wprss-feed-meta\">\n    \n    \n    </div>\n\n            \n        </li>\n                    <li class=\"wpra-item feed-item gurss\">\n            \n            \n\n    <a  href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/the-rare-occasion-we-actually-recommend-a-refurbished-chromebook/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\">The rare occasion we actually recommend a refurbished Chromebook</a>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wprss-feed-meta\">\n    \n    \n    </div>\n\n            \n        </li>\n                    <li class=\"wpra-item feed-item gurss\">\n            \n            \n\n    <a  href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/the-chrome-cast-77-an-exclusive-interview-with-usi-chairman-peter-mueller/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\">The Chrome Cast 77: An exclusive interview with USI Chairman Peter Mueller</a>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wprss-feed-meta\">\n    \n    \n    </div>\n\n            \n        </li>\n                    <li class=\"wpra-item feed-item gurss\">\n            \n            \n\n    <a  href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/new-chromebooks-development-volteer-zork-kukui-dedede\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\">Time to add a ton of Chromebooks to the list of upcoming devices</a>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wprss-feed-meta\">\n    \n    \n    </div>\n\n            \n        </li>\n        </ul>\n\n        \n</div>\n\n</div>\n\n</div>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 28 Aug 2020 12:48:59 +0000","feedId":13345,"bgimg":"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/LenovoChromebookDuetBackToSchool-1024x576.jpg","linkMd5":"e67f21e7e87d82ec0fad683e740a3826","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn9@2020_2/2020/09/05/08-50-11-431_dba6a3364d46cf13.webp","destWidth":1024,"destHeight":576,"sourceBytes":44509,"destBytes":25708,"author":"Gabriel Brangers","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/LenovoChromebookDuetBackToSchool-1024x576.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn9@2020_2/2020/09/05/08-50-11-431_dba6a3364d46cf13.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599295810956},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:10","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:10","title":"Affordable, stowable USI pens will arrive with the next generation of Chromebooks","link":"https://chromeunboxed.com/?p=25311","description":"<a href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/usi-stylus-pen-affordable-chromebooks\" title=\"Affordable, stowable USI pens will arrive with the next generation of Chromebooks\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/hpusistylus-1024x576.jpg\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"display: block;

To this point, the only USI pens we&#8217;ve seen are full-sized pens that are meant to live as outer extensions to the Chromebook experience.  While pens like these are great to hold, they aren&#8217;t always the most practical to keep around.  After all, the best pen is the one you have on you at the time, and internally-stowed pens are the ones that find themselves ready for use at a moment&#8217;s notice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve made this argument often and while I&#8217;ve appreciated the growing number of Chromebooks that support the USI standard, the fact that this means you have to figure out a storage solution for that supported pen means that the times I need my pen, I usually don&#8217;t have it close by.  I&#8217;m not an artist or a person who loves handwriting, so my pen is only useful for tasks like signing documents or marking up notes on an image or draft of a document.  The cases for me to get my pen out are not that numerous, so most times I keep the pen in my bag and when the time comes where I might use it, it isn&#8217;t always within reach.  <strong>This is why I love a stowed stylus option.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this is precisely why I asked Peter about this &#8216;issue&#8217; during our conversation today.  Worried that USI pens would always be the larger, free-floating pens we&#8217;ve seen thus far, I was dubious that such a pen solution would ever make sense for users like me.  <strong>Thankfully, that isn&#8217;t the case.</strong>  According to Pete, with USI, the protocol is light enough and power-efficient enough that we should begin seeing Chromebooks with internally-stowed pens in the next generation of devices.  While the USI standard does need a bit of power to do all of its magic, a rechargeable pen can get juice when stored inside the Chromebook and always be ready for use when the user needs it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apart from our conversation today, <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/amd-chromebook-zork-usi-stylus-pen-internal-charge/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"19809\" target=\"_blank\">we&#8217;ve previously found commits pointing to stowed stylus support for some AMD &#8216;Zork&#8217; Chromebooks,</a> but nothing pointing to this feature for Chromebooks in the more affordable range.  That has changed, however, and we&#8217;ve now found proof of internal USI pen storage/charging on at least one &#8216;Dedede&#8217; Chromebook derivative in &#8216;Drawcia&#8217; that we just added to <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/chromebooks-upcoming-development-boards-devices-chrome-os/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"18348\" target=\"_blank\">our master list of upcoming Chromebook devices</a> we are tracking.  The commit is pretty straightforward, but you can see it below along with the commit that shows USI pen support for the same baseboard:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>UPSTREAM: mb/google/dedede/var/drawcia: Add elan USI touchscreen</p><cite><a href=\"https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromiumos/third_party/coreboot/+/2384903\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">via the Chromium Gerrit</a></cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>drawcia: enable stylus charging Drawcia has garage stylus, this patch enables stylus charging when stylus present.</p><cite><a href=\"https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromiumos/platform/ec/+/2373330\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">via the Chromium Gerrit</a></cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>There are two very cool things happening, here.</strong>  <strong>First,</strong> we&#8217;re seeing more support for stowable, rechargeable USI pens.  Pens that have a recharge method and can be kept safe inside a Chromebook are the right option in my opinion.  Users can always opt to buy an additional, larger USI pen if they want one, but having the built-in stylus always at the ready is obviously a nice touch.  <strong>Second,</strong> we&#8217;re not just seeing this in a flagship device.  &#8216;Dedede&#8217; Chromebooks like &#8216;Drawcia&#8217; will be small-core Intel devices that generally come in at lower prices, so <strong>you can count on internal pens becoming more normalized for even the most affordable Chromebooks once these begin showing up.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For me, this development and the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/usi-stylus-pen-chromebook-hands-on\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"25054\" target=\"_blank\"> ease of use we&#8217;ve seen in the first working USI pen we have in the office</a> combine to make me all-in on USI pens for Chromebooks and any other device that begins using them.  Standards are good in many cases, and I&#8217;d argue that a standard pen for electronics is one of those spaces.  I love &#8211; LOVE &#8211; the idea that one day down the road I may be able to pick up my USI pen and begin writing or navigating on any device I have in front of me.  Chromebook, Windows laptop, Android phone/tablet?  Sure.  <strong>One day it will all just work, and I&#8217;m very much looking forward to that.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/patreonInContentDesktop.jpg\" class=\"patreonDesktop\">\n\n\n\n<div class=\"newsletterSignupBlock\">\n\tGet Alerted About New Posts On <br class=\"forMobileOnly\"><span class=\"highlighter\">Your Schedule</span><br>\n\t<a class=\"BuyButton\" href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/newsletter-sign-up/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sign Up For The Official Chrome Unboxed Newsletter</a>\n<div class=\"divider\"></div>\n<h6>Latest Posts</h6>\n<div class=\"wp-rss-template-container\" data-wpra-template=\"default\" data-template-ctx=\"eyJmZWVkcyI6Im5ld2VzdHBvc3RzIn0=\">\n    <div class=\"wp-rss-aggregator wpra-list-template  \" data-page=\"1\">\n    \n    \n<ul class=\"wpra-item-list rss-aggregator \"\n    start=\"1\">\n                        <li class=\"wpra-item feed-item gurss\">\n            \n            \n\n    <a  href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/usi-stylus-pen-affordable-chromebooks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\">Affordable, stowable USI pens will arrive with the next generation of Chromebooks</a>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wprss-feed-meta\">\n    \n    \n    </div>\n\n            \n        </li>\n                    <li class=\"wpra-item feed-item gurss\">\n            \n            \n\n    <a  href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/the-rare-occasion-we-actually-recommend-a-refurbished-chromebook/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\">The rare occasion we actually recommend a refurbished Chromebook</a>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wprss-feed-meta\">\n    \n    \n    </div>\n\n            \n        </li>\n                    <li class=\"wpra-item feed-item gurss\">\n            \n            \n\n    <a  href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/the-chrome-cast-77-an-exclusive-interview-with-usi-chairman-peter-mueller/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\">The Chrome Cast 77: An exclusive interview with USI Chairman Peter Mueller</a>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wprss-feed-meta\">\n    \n    \n    </div>\n\n            \n        </li>\n                    <li class=\"wpra-item feed-item gurss\">\n            \n            \n\n    <a  href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/new-chromebooks-development-volteer-zork-kukui-dedede\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\">Time to add a ton of Chromebooks to the list of upcoming devices</a>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wprss-feed-meta\">\n    \n    \n    </div>\n\n            \n        </li>\n        </ul>\n\n        \n</div>\n\n</div>\n\n</div>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 05 Sep 2020 00:35:37 +0000","feedId":13345,"bgimg":"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/hpusistylus-1024x576.jpg","linkMd5":"4fdc38a52dfe422f266f194b07631148","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn13@2020_3/2020/09/05/08-50-11-478_2aad85b058505536.webp","destWidth":1024,"destHeight":576,"sourceBytes":132240,"destBytes":108288,"author":"Robby Payne","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/hpusistylus-1024x576.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn13@2020_3/2020/09/05/08-50-11-478_2aad85b058505536.webp","https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/patreonInContentDesktop.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn34@2020_5/2020/09/05/08-50-16-094_3e3fd54965f36783.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599295810954},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:10","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:10","title":"Project 10 Million: T-Mobile brings free high-speed internet and at-cost Chromebooks to students","link":"https://chromeunboxed.com/?p=25278","description":"<a href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/t-mobile-project-10-million-free-internet-at-cost-chromebooks\" title=\"Project 10 Million: T-Mobile brings free high-speed internet and at-cost Chromebooks to students\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/t-mobile-project-10-million-1024x576.jpg\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"display: block;

On the heels of the company finalizing its merger with Sprint, T-Mobile has been working steadily to expand 5G coverage and get high-speed internet into the hands of as many customers as possible. T-Mobile recently announced a three-part initiative that consists of <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.t-mobile.com/business/government/first-responders-connecting-heroes\" target=\"_blank\">free service to America&#8217;s First Responders</a> and the T-Mobile Connect plan that offers unlimited talk and text and 2GB of data for as little as $15/month. <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://prepaid.t-mobile.com/prepaid-plans/connect\" target=\"_blank\">T-Mobile Connect</a> also adds an extra 500MB of data each year for up to five years at no additional cost. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The third and final phase of this initiative comes in the form of a 10 billion dollar commitment to our country&#8217;s education systems. Project 10 Million will span five years and will provide eligible school districts access to free internet for underserved students. This will come in the form of a free mobile hotspot and 100GB of yearly data at no cost to eligible families. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Education is the great leveler, but without internet access, kids will be left behind.

Project 10 Million will soon provide eligible students with tablets, PCs and Chromebooks at-cost to ensure a viable solution for at-home learning. Among these devices are the Samsung Chromebook 4 and the Lenovo 100e Chromebook. Participants in the project can get up to 5 devices at cost per eligible line. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>At-cost devices</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Coolpad Tasker tablet</li><li>Samsung Chromebook 4</li><li>Lenovo 100e Chromebook (Coming soon)</li><li>Lenovo 100e Windows PC (Coming soon)</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>To find out if your school has joined Project 10 Million, contact your school administrator.

One of Stadia&#8217;s biggest draws right now is the fact that Google continues to go above and beyond in offering free games to Pro subscribers.  Initially promising only one or two titles a month, we&#8217;ve routinely seen months with 4-6 new titles added to play for free for users in the Pro tier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This month is no different as Stadia has given Pro subscribers an additional six games to begin playing for free, taking the grand total of free Pro games up over 30 since Stadia&#8217;s launch.  Along with these new titles, 3 free Pro games will drop from the list of games you can claim for free on August 31st, so make sure and go snag them while you can.  Those titles include <strong><em>Get Packed, Kona, and GRID.</em></strong>  For the new games being added, <a href=\"https://community.stadia.com/t5/Stadia-Community-Blog/This-Week-on-Stadia-Six-more-free-games-headed-to-Pro-in/ba-p/28703\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">here&#8217;s what Stadia has to say about each:</a></p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong>Bomberman R Online:</strong> ake on 63 other players in Super Bomberman R Online! It’s the biggest Bomberman challenge ever. <strong>(First on Stadia)</strong></p><p><strong>Gunsport:</strong> Gunsport is an action-packed two-on-two competitive challenge. Take on rival teams in a rapid-fire trick-shot competition on Stadia Pro. <strong>(First on Stadia)</strong></p><p><strong>Hitman:</strong> Hide in plain sight in Hitman, the stylish stealth action game where you use disguise and your wits to infiltrate fantastic international locales.</p><p><strong>Hello Neighbor:</strong> Something strange and sinister is going on down the street in Hello Neighbor. Can you solve the mystery, survive the cunning traps, and avoid a devilishly clever enemy who always seems one step ahead of you?</p><p><strong>Metro Last Light Redux: </strong>Return to the darkness of the Moscow subways and battle mutants in Metro Last Light Redux.</p><p><strong>Embr:</strong> Team up with friends in Embr! You can play it free with Stadia Pro starting September 1. Since Embr is still in Early Access, the developers are continuing to add to the game to give you the best experience.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>As Stadia&#8217;s library continues to grow with existing games many players already know and love and Stadia firsts like Bomberman R Online and Gunsport, Google keeps making the platform more and more attractive to new players.  As we&#8217;ve watched the development of game streaming happen over the past year, one thing is certain: <strong>this is a long play.</strong>  More games and better experiences will draw more players over time.  Once all three are in place, Stadia will thrive, but it will take time.  If Google keeps throwing free stuff at subscribers like this, its definitely another step in the right direction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://chrmshop.com/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"BuyButton\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Shop Best Chromebooks of 2020 So Far on Chrome Shop</a></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"newsletterSignupBlock\">\n\tGet Alerted About New Posts On <br class=\"forMobileOnly\"><span class=\"highlighter\">Your Schedule</span><br>\n\t<a class=\"BuyButton\" href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/newsletter-sign-up/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sign Up For The Official Chrome Unboxed Newsletter</a>\n<div class=\"divider\"></div>\n<h6>Latest Posts</h6>\n<div class=\"wp-rss-template-container\" data-wpra-template=\"default\" data-template-ctx=\"eyJmZWVkcyI6Im5ld2VzdHBvc3RzIn0=\">\n    <div class=\"wp-rss-aggregator wpra-list-template  \" data-page=\"1\">\n    \n    \n<ul class=\"wpra-item-list rss-aggregator \"\n    start=\"1\">\n                        <li class=\"wpra-item feed-item gurss\">\n            \n            \n\n    <a  href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/usi-stylus-pen-affordable-chromebooks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\">Affordable, stowable USI pens will arrive with the next generation of Chromebooks</a>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wprss-feed-meta\">\n    \n    \n    </div>\n\n            \n        </li>\n                    <li class=\"wpra-item feed-item gurss\">\n            \n            \n\n    <a  href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/the-rare-occasion-we-actually-recommend-a-refurbished-chromebook/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\">The rare occasion we actually recommend a refurbished Chromebook</a>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wprss-feed-meta\">\n    \n    \n    </div>\n\n            \n        </li>\n                    <li class=\"wpra-item feed-item gurss\">\n            \n            \n\n    <a  href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/the-chrome-cast-77-an-exclusive-interview-with-usi-chairman-peter-mueller/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\">The Chrome Cast 77: An exclusive interview with USI Chairman Peter Mueller</a>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wprss-feed-meta\">\n    \n    \n    </div>\n\n            \n        </li>\n                    <li class=\"wpra-item feed-item gurss\">\n            \n            \n\n    <a  href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/new-chromebooks-development-volteer-zork-kukui-dedede\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\">Time to add a ton of Chromebooks to the list of upcoming devices</a>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wprss-feed-meta\">\n    \n    \n    </div>\n\n            \n        </li>\n        </ul>\n\n        \n</div>\n\n</div>\n\n</div>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 26 Aug 2020 19:11:20 +0000","feedId":13345,"bgimg":"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/stadiaProFreeGamesSeptember2020-1024x576.jpg","linkMd5":"58dbda6524a69fc87842922cbbc0ec34","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn86@2020_5/2020/09/05/08-50-11-423_fac758a12cb00fc6.webp","destWidth":1024,"destHeight":576,"sourceBytes":85959,"destBytes":57622,"author":"Robby Payne","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/stadiaProFreeGamesSeptember2020-1024x576.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn86@2020_5/2020/09/05/08-50-11-423_fac758a12cb00fc6.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599295810956},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:10","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:10","title":"[Update: Sold Out] This certified USI stylus is available once again for $49","link":"https://chromeunboxed.com/?p=25015","description":"<a href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/certified-usi-universal-stylus-initiative-available-iplume-chromebook-compatible\" title=\"[Update: Sold Out] This certified USI stylus is available once again for $49\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/USIstylusPenChromebookAmazon-1024x576.jpg\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"display: block;

The concept is a brilliant one. Create a universal standard for digital pens so when you purchase one, it works on a range of devices with the same functionality and reliability. The biggest obstacle we&#8217;ve seen with the emerging tech is availability. More and more Chromebooks are hitting the market with the USI compatibility on board but the pens are nowhere to be found. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>HP <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/hps-rechargeable-usi-stylus-is-finally-available-for-purchase/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"17682\" target=\"_blank\">quietly released its rechargeable USI stylus</a> but it has since sold out and the only place you can find it is on Amazon at an inflated cost. ASUS and Lenovo both have pens on the way and you can even find listings for them but they simply haven&#8217;t hit the supply channels yet. Thankfully, there are some third-party companies that are and will be creating &#8220;universal&#8221; styluses and one such company has one available to ship within the next week and a half. iPlume&#8217;s USI pen is powered by a AAAA battery and features two barrel buttons. It happens to be identical to a couple of devices we have in the office. We&#8217;re still taking some time to do a full review but I can say that they work perfectly with devices such as the Lenovo Chromebook Duet, Chromebook 10e and the Acer Chromebook Spin 713. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The iPlume listing popped up a few days back but quickly sold out and the listing was marked as such. Now, you can order the stylus once again for $49 and shipping is slated to start September 8. If you are shopping for a USI stylus, this and the HP are the only two that we are aware of at the moment that are actually available. If you decide to check out other &#8220;universal&#8221; styluses, make sure you see the USI logo somewhere so you can be sure it is legit. You can find the iPlume USI stylus over on the Chrome Shop at the link below. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img data-attachment-id=\"25019\" data-permalink=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/certified-usi-universal-stylus-initiative-available-iplume-chromebook-compatible/screenshot-2020-08-29-at-12-52-16-pm/\" data-orig-file=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-08-29-at-12.52.16-PM.png\" data-orig-size=\"332,123\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&#34;aperture&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;credit&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;camera&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;caption&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;created_timestamp&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;copyright&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;focal_length&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;iso&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;shutter_speed&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;title&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;orientation&#34;:&#34;0&#34;}\" data-image-title=\"Screenshot-2020-08-29-at-12.52.16-PM\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-08-29-at-12.52.16-PM-300x111.png\" data-large-file=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-08-29-at-12.52.16-PM.png\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"332\" height=\"123\" src=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-08-29-at-12.52.16-PM.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-25019\" srcset=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-08-29-at-12.52.16-PM.png 332w, https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-08-29-at-12.52.16-PM-300x111.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 332px) 100vw, 332px\" /><figcaption>Look for the USI Logo</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Update</strong>: It looks like we&#8217;re not the only ones looking for USI pens.

Presumably the successor to the Pixelbook, &#8216;Halvor&#8217; is in possession of a Google-only feature that we&#8217;ve only seen in the Pixelbook, Pixelbook Go and Pixel Slate up to this point in the <strong>#madebyGoogle</strong> era of Chromebooks.  Obviously there&#8217;s a lot to unpack on this subject and its a fun discussion to have as we consider Google moving from a position of setting the bar for the ecosystem to simply being an active participant in it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also spend a bit of time in this podcast talking about USI pens and the duo of test pens we now have in the office that confirm how good USI compatibility will be once these accessories finally start shipping in the coming months.

After all, Stadia&#8217;s been at it for a solid 9 months at this point, so NVIDIA likely learned a thing or two about pushing game streaming services through web-based technologies from Stadia&#8217;s ups and downs.  Never mind the fact that much of the plumbing needed to make low-latency game streaming possible on the web is done in Chrome via open source standards for the Chromium projects.  <strong>All that work isn&#8217;t just for Stadia and can be easily leveraged by others like NVIDIA when needed.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stadia&#8217;s web player isn&#8217;t without faults and to test that assertion, I launched into PUBG right before writing this article and still have tons of odd mouse movement jitter and a recurring issue where holding the &#8216;W&#8217; key to move forward simply stops working.  When running from the dangerous, oncoming blue, it&#8217;s really a bummer when your character just stops all of the sudden.  Don&#8217;t get me wrong, the web portal for Stadia is still wildly impressive, <strong>but it isn&#8217;t without flaw.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/nvidia-geforce-now-chromebook-suppport-web-player-stadia-trouble/\" target=\"_blank\">When NVIDIA announced their take on their own web-based player,</a> I simply thought they&#8217;d base it in Chrome and make it available wherever Chrome lives.  While not necessary for the big two desktop platforms (Windows and MacOS have dedicated GeForce NOW apps, after all), I honestly thought the Chrome browser would be the primary factor involved in making GeForce NOW a reality on the web.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I didn&#8217;t realize at the onset of the service is the fact that <strong>NVIDIA chose to launch the GeForce NOW web experience for Chromebooks.  Period.</strong>  This isn&#8217;t a <em>Chrome-specific ability.</em>  Instead, this is a <em>Chrome OS-specific ability.</em>  And, honestly, that was exciting for us to learn.  You have to understand that as a Chromebook user and unabashed Chrome OS fan/nerd, I constantly &#8211; CONSTANTLY &#8211; deal with platform limitations when it comes to app support.  Believe it or not, many popular applications have either useless Android versions or don&#8217;t bother with web apps of any sort (please sense my sarcasm, here).  Though they could easily leverage either platform, they simply don&#8217;t, and that means Chromebook users are left out in the cold for a lot of things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m used to this reality by now and many other users are as well, but I can&#8217;t lie: <strong>when a big company chooses to target Chromebook users as a primary audience and makes a product for Chrome OS and for Chrome OS alone, I get a little giddy inside.</strong>  We Chromebook users don&#8217;t get a ton of stuff that is just for us, and when it happens I still find myself a bit dubious about the whole thing.  I honestly had trouble believing NVIDIA launched an entire web experience for GeForce NOW just for Chromebooks when they first announced it, but that is exactly what they have done.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"crp_related crp_related_block  \"><h5>more from Chrome Unboxed</h5><ul><li><a href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/nvidia-geforce-now-games-studios-cyberpunk-2077-million-users/\"    target=\"_blank\"  class=\"post-15434\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  width=\"150\" height=\"150\"  src=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/NVIDIAgeforceNowChromebookAndroid-150x150.jpg\" class=\"crp_thumb crp_featured\" alt=\"NVIDIA GeForce NOW loses some games but still gaining momentum\" title=\"NVIDIA GeForce NOW loses some games but still gaining momentum\" /><span class=\"crp_title\">NVIDIA GeForce NOW loses some games but still gaining momentum</span></a><span class=\"crp_author\">  by <a href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/author/robbypayne/\">Robby Payne</a></span> </li></ul><div class=\"crp_clear\"></div></div>\n\n\n<h2>Why it matters</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This all becomes important in two big ways.  <strong>On one hand, we now have a web-based game streaming experience that is flat-out fantastic on Chromebooks.</strong>  While I&#8217;ve played Stadia here and there on the web when I don&#8217;t have a TV/Chromecast handy, I&#8217;m drawn to GeForce NOW on the web as a stable, usable, and highly-playable platform for games like Fortnite, APEX Legends, and Hyper Scape.  <strong>It&#8217;s not just a novelty:</strong> it is supremely playable and so much fun that I honestly forget I&#8217;m streaming games from a server most times.  I don&#8217;t know this for fact, but I&#8217;d say part of that great experience is the fact that NVIDIA only focused on one version of Chrome for the experience instead of having to figure out all the issues that may arise on Windows and MacOS, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>On the other hand, the arguably more-important factor here is that a company the size of NVIDIA <em>sees</em> Chrome OS.  <em>Really sees it.</em></strong>  While Chromebooks haven&#8217;t historically been a legitimate development target, it seems that period may be coming to an end.  Instead of being the last group software makers consider, perhaps the recent growth and adoption of Chrome OS is finally starting to make the case that Chromebook users aren&#8217;t second-class citizens and are worth considering when building experiences.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take Adobe Premiere Rush as an example.  When the app launched on more-popular operating systems over a year ago, <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/adobe-premier-rush-android-chromebook-chrome-os/\" target=\"_blank\">Chromebook support was promised.</a>  Over a year later, we still have little proof that the app is actually going to ship any time soon.  <strong>Why is that? </strong> Adobe clearly doesn&#8217;t see the benefit in engaging Chromebook users with their services or at least didn&#8217;t until recently.  <a href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/adobe-premiere-rush-chromebooks-chrome-os-play-store\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"24820\">With the app showing up at random for some users</a> in the Play Store on Chrome OS, perhaps that is changing, but it doesn&#8217;t change the fact that Adobe &#8211; like many other software companies &#8211; views Chromebooks as a side project and not worth their full attention.  <strong>Can you imagine Premiere Rush just skipping out on iOS?  Exactly.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>NVIDIA is a massive company and well aware of the potential of different operating systems.  I don&#8217;t think many people would have blamed them if they just shelved the whole GeForce on Chromebooks idea.  <strong>But they didn&#8217;t. </strong> Instead, it seems they have fully leaned in and made something quite special, and that says something about the potential and benefit NVIDIA sees in the Chromebook user community.  As we&#8217;ve said for years, the population of Chromebook users is growing rapidly and those that see this and begin taking advantage of it will reap the benefits of a user base that is thirsty for great software for their hardware.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The ramifications of this could be quite large, honestly. </strong> If app developers who build web apps, Android apps, or Linux apps begin seeing larger companies like NVIDIA taking Chrome OS very seriously and having success, there&#8217;s a big chance that they will begin to follow suit.  <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/krita-android-chrome-os-chromebooks-free-painting-professional-desktop-app/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"18295\" target=\"_blank\">I&#8217;ve harped on this before</a> and I&#8217;ll say it until I&#8217;m blue in the face: Android has the ability to deliver solid desktop apps if developers choose to make it so.  Thus far, many have chosen not to and I&#8217;d wager they are missing a massive, growing crowd of users that could potentially adopt their app in droves if it was a solid experience on the larger screen of their Chromebook.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The same effect could happen with web apps and Linux apps, too.  As developers see the potential that sits in the ever-expanding user base for Chrome OS, perhaps more time, effort, and intentionality will follow.  As a long-time Chromebook user, I know that&#8217;s exactly what I&#8217;m after.  I want great app experiences regardless of where that app comes from.  I want solid options and apps that do awesome things and simply perform on my Chromebook.  Comapanies that see this, develop things like this, and deliver those products to market have a very good chance of earning my loyalty as a user. <strong>And I&#8217;d guarantee I&#8217;m far from the only one who thinks that.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://fave.co/2Sxx7wt\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"BuyButton\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sign Up for GeForce NOW</a></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"newsletterSignupBlock\">\n\tGet Alerted About New Posts On <br class=\"forMobileOnly\"><span class=\"highlighter\">Your Schedule</span><br>\n\t<a class=\"BuyButton\" href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/newsletter-sign-up/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sign Up For The Official Chrome Unboxed Newsletter</a>\n<div class=\"divider\"></div>\n<h6>Latest Posts</h6>\n<div class=\"wp-rss-template-container\" data-wpra-template=\"default\" data-template-ctx=\"eyJmZWVkcyI6Im5ld2VzdHBvc3RzIn0=\">\n    <div class=\"wp-rss-aggregator wpra-list-template  \" data-page=\"1\">\n    \n    \n<ul class=\"wpra-item-list rss-aggregator \"\n    start=\"1\">\n                        <li class=\"wpra-item feed-item gurss\">\n            \n            \n\n    <a  href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/usi-stylus-pen-affordable-chromebooks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\">Affordable, stowable USI pens will arrive with the next generation of Chromebooks</a>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wprss-feed-meta\">\n    \n    \n    </div>\n\n            \n        </li>\n                    <li class=\"wpra-item feed-item gurss\">\n            \n            \n\n    <a  href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/the-rare-occasion-we-actually-recommend-a-refurbished-chromebook/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\">The rare occasion we actually recommend a refurbished Chromebook</a>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wprss-feed-meta\">\n    \n    \n    </div>\n\n            \n        </li>\n                    <li class=\"wpra-item feed-item gurss\">\n            \n            \n\n    <a  href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/the-chrome-cast-77-an-exclusive-interview-with-usi-chairman-peter-mueller/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\">The Chrome Cast 77: An exclusive interview with USI Chairman Peter Mueller</a>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wprss-feed-meta\">\n    \n    \n    </div>\n\n            \n        </li>\n                    <li class=\"wpra-item feed-item gurss\">\n            \n            \n\n    <a  href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/new-chromebooks-development-volteer-zork-kukui-dedede\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\">Time to add a ton of Chromebooks to the list of upcoming devices</a>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wprss-feed-meta\">\n    \n    \n    </div>\n\n            \n        </li>\n        </ul>\n\n        \n</div>\n\n</div>\n\n</div>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 26 Aug 2020 16:28:58 +0000","feedId":13345,"bgimg":"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NVIDIAgeforceNOWChromebooks-1024x576.jpg","linkMd5":"6aa62717628611adc96ad02cae170096","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn81@2020_4/2020/09/05/08-50-11-404_94b547e161adde7c.webp","destWidth":1024,"destHeight":576,"sourceBytes":62697,"destBytes":40860,"author":"Robby Payne","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NVIDIAgeforceNOWChromebooks-1024x576.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn81@2020_4/2020/09/05/08-50-11-404_94b547e161adde7c.webp","https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/NVIDIAgeforceNowChromebookAndroid-150x150.jpg":null},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599295810956},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:10","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:10","title":"Two simple ways to grab a full-page website screenshot on a Chromebook","link":"https://chromeunboxed.com/?p=24949","description":"<a href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/chrome-full-website-screen-capture-extension-developer-tools\" title=\"Two simple ways to grab a full-page website screenshot on a Chromebook\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ChromeFullScreenWebCapture-1024x576.jpg\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"display: block;

After all, simple tasks like reviewing a document or design template aren&#8217;t as straight forward as they once were when most of us were in shared workspaces.  Without the ability to just walk over to a coworker&#8217;s desk and point out things that need an adjustment, <strong>the ability to capture media and annotate that media becomes pretty important.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve had countless times where I&#8217;ve needed to do something like this, but the thing I needed to annotate has been a website.  Not just the top fold, but the entire homepage or and entire internal page.  For me and many others, the task of getting a single image of the entirety of a website is a bit daunting and time consuming if you don&#8217;t have the right tools at your disposal.  With that in mind, after <a href=\"https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/how-to-screen-capture-a-full-webpage-on-a-chromebook/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">seeing a post by About Chromebooks on the same topic,</a> we wanted to offer up a couple ways to achieve this task in cleanest, fastest, simplest way possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The built-in Chrome method</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Highlighted in Kevin&#8217;s piece about this same thing, there is a way to snag a full website screen grab with no extensions or additional tools needed.  The functionality is hidden in the devleoper tools, so it&#8217;s not quite as simplistic as the second method we&#8217;ll highlight, but it is nice that this method will always be there in Chrome regardless of whether or not you&#8217;ve installed an extension prior.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To get this working, you simply need to open up the developer tools  by keyboard shortcut <strong>(CTRL + SHIFT + I)</strong> or by right-clicking anywhere on the website and selecting &#8216;Inspect&#8217; from the list.  Once there, open up a search by hitting <strong>CTRL + SHIFT + P</strong> and then type the word &#8216;screen&#8217; to see the handful of screenshot options.   Select the one called &#8216;Capture full size screenshot&#8217; and in a few seconds, you&#8217;ll be prompted to save your full screenshot via the Files app.  Easy!</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img data-attachment-id=\"24954\" data-permalink=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/chrome-full-website-screen-capture-extension-developer-tools/developertoolssearch/\" data-orig-file=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/developerToolsSearch.png\" data-orig-size=\"565,267\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&#34;aperture&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;credit&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;camera&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;caption&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;created_timestamp&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;copyright&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;focal_length&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;iso&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;shutter_speed&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;title&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;orientation&#34;:&#34;0&#34;}\" data-image-title=\"developerToolsSearch\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/developerToolsSearch-300x142.png\" data-large-file=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/developerToolsSearch.png\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"565\" height=\"267\" src=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/developerToolsSearch.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-24954\" srcset=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/developerToolsSearch.png 565w, https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/developerToolsSearch-300x142.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 565px) 100vw, 565px\" /><figcaption>searching developer tools for screenshot options</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>The even-simpler extension method</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If any of that up there feels like a bit too much work, there is an extension option for this exact same thing that is quite a bit more user-friendly, available in the Chrome Web Store, and comes highly-rated from the more than 4 million users and 45,000 reviews.  We went hands-on with the <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gofullpage-full-page-scre/fdpohaocaechififmbbbbbknoalclacl/related?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">GoFullPage extension</a> and, not-surprisingly, it works just as expected.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"crp_related crp_related_block  \"><h5>more from Chrome Unboxed</h5><ul><li><a href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/which-chromebook-buying-help-choices-5-questions/\"    target=\"_blank\"  class=\"post-12873\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  width=\"150\" height=\"150\"  src=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/chromebook-buying-guide-choice-5-questions-150x150.jpg\" class=\"crp_thumb crp_featured\" alt=\"How to choose the right Chromebook with 5 simple questions [VIDEO]\" title=\"How to choose the right Chromebook with 5 simple questions [VIDEO]\" /><span class=\"crp_title\">How to choose the right Chromebook with 5 simple questions [VIDEO]</span></a><span class=\"crp_author\">  by <a href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/author/robbypayne/\">Robby Payne</a></span> </li></ul><div class=\"crp_clear\"></div></div>\n\n\n<p>After installing the extension, you get a few options like image format (PNG vs. JPG), some resizing tools, and the ability to set parameters on what to do with the screen grab once it has been captured.  You can download your finished capture as an image or PDF and there is a simple image editor built in as well for adding stickers and basic shapes to your screen capture.  That last feature will cost you a small subscription fee, though, so if you have markup tools you already use, I&#8217;d just stick with those for now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, this method is by far an easier option for those that need to grab full website screenshots, but I&#8217;d still lean towards using the developer tools method for simplicity&#8217;s sake.  I like to keep my Chrome extensions as minimal as possible, so even though the developer tool method takes a few more steps to memorize, I love the fact that this functionality is simply built right into Chrome already.  I would love to see this just become an option built into the standard screen grab feature, but for now it will remain tucked away as a developer option.  Oh, and in the event that you are wondering about those basic screen capture options, a standard screen grab is performed by a <strong>CTRL + Overview Button</strong> and a re-sizable screen grab can be done with <strong>CTRL + SHIFT + Overview Button.</strong>  Have fun!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://chrmshop.com/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"BuyButton\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Shop Best Chromebooks of 2020 So Far on Chrome Shop</a></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"newsletterSignupBlock\">\n\tGet Alerted About New Posts On <br class=\"forMobileOnly\"><span class=\"highlighter\">Your Schedule</span><br>\n\t<a class=\"BuyButton\" href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/newsletter-sign-up/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sign Up For The Official Chrome Unboxed Newsletter</a>\n<div class=\"divider\"></div>\n<h6>Latest Posts</h6>\n<div class=\"wp-rss-template-container\" data-wpra-template=\"default\" data-template-ctx=\"eyJmZWVkcyI6Im5ld2VzdHBvc3RzIn0=\">\n    <div class=\"wp-rss-aggregator wpra-list-template  \" data-page=\"1\">\n    \n    \n<ul class=\"wpra-item-list rss-aggregator \"\n    start=\"1\">\n                        <li class=\"wpra-item feed-item gurss\">\n            \n            \n\n    <a  href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/usi-stylus-pen-affordable-chromebooks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\">Affordable, stowable USI pens will arrive with the next generation of Chromebooks</a>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wprss-feed-meta\">\n    \n    \n    </div>\n\n            \n        </li>\n                    <li class=\"wpra-item feed-item gurss\">\n            \n            \n\n    <a  href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/the-rare-occasion-we-actually-recommend-a-refurbished-chromebook/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\">The rare occasion we actually recommend a refurbished Chromebook</a>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wprss-feed-meta\">\n    \n    \n    </div>\n\n            \n        </li>\n                    <li class=\"wpra-item feed-item gurss\">\n            \n            \n\n    <a  href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/the-chrome-cast-77-an-exclusive-interview-with-usi-chairman-peter-mueller/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\">The Chrome Cast 77: An exclusive interview with USI Chairman Peter Mueller</a>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wprss-feed-meta\">\n    \n    \n    </div>\n\n            \n        </li>\n                    <li class=\"wpra-item feed-item gurss\">\n            \n            \n\n    <a  href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/new-chromebooks-development-volteer-zork-kukui-dedede\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\">Time to add a ton of Chromebooks to the list of upcoming devices</a>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wprss-feed-meta\">\n    \n    \n    </div>\n\n            \n        </li>\n        </ul>\n\n        \n</div>\n\n</div>\n\n</div>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 27 Aug 2020 18:42:40 +0000","feedId":13345,"bgimg":"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ChromeFullScreenWebCapture-1024x576.jpg","linkMd5":"b8ff85426013d8fe7e9007ee9c03c119","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn89@2020_3/2020/09/05/08-50-11-408_d5c1931f636fa274.webp","destWidth":1024,"destHeight":576,"sourceBytes":84836,"destBytes":53570,"author":"Robby Payne","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ChromeFullScreenWebCapture-1024x576.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn89@2020_3/2020/09/05/08-50-11-408_d5c1931f636fa274.webp","https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/developerToolsSearch.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn64@2020_5/2020/09/05/08-50-14-664_ad34cb363cf4bdf4.webp","https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/chromebook-buying-guide-choice-5-questions-150x150.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn19@2020_1/2020/09/05/08-50-14-546_063ca67da4f45e1e.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599295810956},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:10","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:10","title":"All the upcoming Chrome OS devices and boards we’re tracking right now [UPDATE: 9/4/2020]","link":"https://chromeunboxed.com/?p=18348","description":"<a href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/chromebooks-upcoming-development-boards-devices-chrome-os/\" title=\"All the upcoming Chrome OS devices and boards we&#8217;re tracking right now [UPDATE: 9/4/2020]\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"711\" src=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/NewWaveChromebooksEarly2020-1024x711.jpg\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"display: block;

9/4/2020: </strong>Based on the recent finds, we&#8217;re adding quite a few devices to the mix today.  We have some Tiger Lake Chromebooks, some AMD Chromebooks, some new MediaTek 8183 Chromebooks, and some Jasper Lake Chromebooks to add to the ever-expanding list in this update, so take a look!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From time to time, it is useful to get your thoughts in one place.  As we continue to track new baseboards and upcoming Chrome OS devices on a daily basis, it can become a bit confusing for us as writers and for you as readers exactly which board is expected to do what.  A few years ago, we&#8217;d be tracking a handful of devices, see those devices arrive, and move on to looking for more.  It was pretty easy to keep all the newness in front of us back then, <strong>but it&#8217;s a very different story these days.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking at my notes and my starred/saved changes from the Chromium Repositories, there are <strong><em>so many</em></strong> new devices in development across multiple different baseboards with a wide assortment of chip sets, configurations, and form factors.  As I began looking across all those boards and upcoming devices, it hit me that we&#8217;d do well to take some inventory of where we are, where we&#8217;re going, and what all these code-names and baseboards have to do with upcoming Chromebooks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A quick note in the event that all this is new to you:</strong> baseboards and overlays are code-named in the open source Chromium Repositories and usually exist these days in a particular structure.  There are unibuild boards that spawn multiple different devices with their own code-named overlays.  These devices will be similar on the inside, but each one could be a different Chromebook made by a different manufacturer.  The recently released Lenovo Flex 5 and ASUS Chromebook C436 are both based on the unibuild &#8216;Hatch&#8217; baseboard, for example, and are quite different on the outside. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>There&#8217;s a lot of info to take in here, so this is how we&#8217;ll proceed:</strong> we&#8217;ll put each main, unibuild board as a heading, explain what the main features are of that board, and then list the overlays and devices being built off of that board.  We&#8217;ll link the lists to what we know about these upcoming Chromebooks so you can research further if you&#8217;d like. So, with that in mind, let&#8217;s dive in and see everything we know about at this point in 2020.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>&#8216;Kukui&#8217;</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The &#8216;Kukui&#8217; baseboard is the unibuild that has already spawned the Lenovo 10e and the Chromebook Duet.  We know there are more devices coming based on this board with the possibility of at least one more tablet/detachable variant.  These Chromebooks will run on the MediaTek P60T chip set and, like the Duet, will be decent performers with great battery life.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/unboxing-the-lenovo-chromebook-duet/\" target=\"_blank\">&#8216;Krane&#8217; (Lenovo Chromebook Duet)</a></li><li><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/lenovo-chromebook-10e-duet-tablet-preview/\" target=\"_blank\">&#8216;Kodama&#8217; (Lenovo Chromebook 10e)</a></li><li><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/mediatek-chromebook-in-the-works-where-are-you-qualcomm/\" target=\"_blank\">&#8216;Jacuzzi&#8217;</a></li><li><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/mediatek-chromebooks-four-new-devices-in-the-works/\" target=\"_blank\">&#8216;Damu&#8217;</a></li><li><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/mediatek-chromebooks-four-new-devices-in-the-works/\" target=\"_blank\">&#8216;Kappa&#8217;</a></li><li><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/mediatek-chromebooks-four-new-devices-in-the-works/\" target=\"_blank\">&#8216;Kakadu&#8217;</a></li><li><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/mediatek-chromebooks-four-new-devices-in-the-works/\" target=\"_blank\">&#8216;Juniper&#8217;</a></li><li><a href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/new-chromebooks-development-volteer-zork-kukui-dedede\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">&#8216;Willow&#8217;</a></li><li><a href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/new-chromebooks-development-volteer-zork-kukui-dedede\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">&#8216;Burnet&#8217;</a></li><li><a href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/new-chromebooks-development-volteer-zork-kukui-dedede\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">&#8216;Esche&#8217;</a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h4>&#8216;Hatch&#8217;</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The &#8216;Hatch&#8217; baseboard is based on the 10th-gen Intel Comet Lake chips and these Chromebooks come with an armada of upgrades over their 8th-gen predecessors.  &#8216;Hatch&#8217;-based Chromebooks will have faster performance, WiFi 6, Bluetooth 5, optional NVMe storage, fingerprint scanners, pen support, and premium build options.  However, &#8216;Hatch&#8217; boards can also spawn devices like the Lenovo Flex 5 Chromebook that bring much of the goodness of the latest-gen hardware and keep the price in check.

The chip on board for this one is the MediaTek 8192 and it is a substantial upgrade over the 8183 (also called the Helio P60T) that is found in &#8216;Kukui&#8217; devices.  With the underlying similarities to &#8216;Kukui&#8217;, we expect development to move fast with &#8216;Asurada&#8217; and we&#8217;d expect it to spawn quite a few boards in the coming months.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>&#8216;Zork&#8217;</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>While we&#8217;ve become accustomed to seeing the latest Intel chips in new Chromebook boards, it is really awesome to see higher-powered AMD chips being worked on for use in a handful of upcoming Chromebooks.  We had a small wave of affordable AMD devices last year, but those were based on the older A4 and A6 chips that offered little in the way of upgrades from the more-affordable mobile Intel processors.  With these new Picasso chips from AMD, Intel may finally have a fight on its hands for top-tier Chromebook performance.  Additionally, there are a couple boards below that are a sort of tandem to &#8216;Zork&#8217; in &#8216;Dalboz&#8217; and &#8216;Ezkinil&#8217; that are swapping the AMD Picasso chips for the newer, more-mobile focused Dali processors.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/new-chromebook-zork-takes-amd-to/\" target=\"_blank\">&#8216;Zork&#8217;</a></li><li><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/amd-mobile-processors-athlon-ryzen-dali-chromebooks/\" target=\"_blank\">&#8216;Trembyle&#8217;</a></li><li><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/amd-ryzen-picasso-chromebook-morphius-vega-graphics/\" target=\"_blank\">&#8216;Morphius&#8217;</a></li><li><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/amd-chromebook-picasso-apu-ces-2020/\" target=\"_blank\">&#8216;Mandolin&#8217;</a></li><li><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/amd-mobile-processors-athlon-ryzen-dali-chromebooks/\" target=\"_blank\">&#8216;Dalboz&#8217;</a></li><li><a href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/amd-mobile-processors-athlon-ryzen-dali-chromebooks/\">&#8216;Ezkinil&#8217;</a></li><li><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/amd-chromebooks-zork-two-new-boards-development/\" target=\"_blank\">&#8216;Vilboz&#8217;</a></li><li><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/amd-chromebooks-zork-two-new-boards-development/\" target=\"_blank\">&#8216;Berknip&#8217;</a></li><li><a href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/new-chromebooks-development-volteer-zork-kukui-dedede\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">&#8216;Dirinboz&#8217;</a></li><li><a href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/new-chromebooks-development-volteer-zork-kukui-dedede\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">&#8216;Woomax&#8217;</a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h4>&#8216;Trogdor&#8217;</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>This chip set is one we&#8217;ve been looking at for a very, very long time.  &#8216;Trogdor&#8217; is the torch-bearer for what we hope will become the first Qualcomm Snapdragon Chromebook.  In development for years already, we used to keep tabs on &#8216;Cheza&#8217; as the first possible Snapdragon device, but it looks like &#8216;Cheza&#8217; may never materialize as it is based on the Snapdragon 845 chip that is rapidly becoming obsolete.  Instead, &#8216;Trogdor&#8217; looks to leverage the newer Snapdragon Compute 7c chip set that makes far more sense in Chromebooks.  </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-7c-chromebook/\" target=\"_blank\">&#8216;Trogdor&#8217;</a></li><li><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/chrome-os-tablet-phone-snapdragon-screen/\" target=\"_blank\">&#8216;Bubs&#8217;</a></li><li><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-7c-chromebook-development-lazor-trogdor/\" target=\"_blank\">&#8216;Lazor&#8217;</a></li><li>&#8216;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/?s=cheza\" target=\"_blank\">Cheza</a>&#8216;</li><li><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/pompom-qualcomm-snapdragon-chromebook-production-compal-quanta-coming-soon/\" target=\"_blank\">&#8216;Pompom&#8217;</a></li><li><a href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/snapdragon-7c-chromebook-limozeen-trogdor\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"25207\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">&#8216;Limozeen&#8217;</a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h4>&#8216;Dedede&#8217;</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>We only know a bit about this board, but the main highlight is the Jasper Lake Intel processors that will retain the low price of Intel&#8217;s small core, mobile-focused chips while giving users a very nice speed bump over the current Gemini Lake Chromebooks.

While we haven&#8217;t seen anything official about the update going live, Google has announced some new features for Chrome OS. Presumably, these features will be part of the update when it does happen. These updates may seem relatively insignificant in relation to the past few Chrome OS versions but they bring some very useful features to users that&#8217;s what we love to see. We&#8217;ll keep looking for an actual device to update and let you know when it looks like the rollout is live. In the meantime, here&#8217;s what&#8217;s new and headed our way in Chrome OS. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Wi-Fi Sync</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Syncing Wi-Fi passwords across devices may not be the first thing you think of when you&#8217;re logging into a new Chromebook. Most of us are used to uses a device for the first time and setting up the network before logging in. However, with Wi-Fi Sync, you&#8217;ll wish Google had done this years ago. The new feature will sync Wi-Fi credentials to your profile &#8220;keychain&#8221; and carry it to any other device you log into. It may seem like a minor thing but think about all the times you went to your parents&#8217; house and had to get the insanely long password off the back of the router that&#8217;s behind the television where dust bunnies go to die. Yeah, it&#8217;s a pain.

For example, if I search &#8220;wi-fi&#8221; on Chrome OS 84, I will see any wi-fi-related settings highlighted in yellow. If I change the search term to &#8220;wifi,&#8221; I get nothing. Chrome OS 85 will bring a more intuitive settings search and even give you suggestions for items that may be related to the setting your are seeking. Building on this new feature, future updates will add this search feature to the app launcher.

You&#8217;ll also be able to capture still images while recording video which is a feature that should be a part of any decent camera.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Untitled__Aug_20_2020_5_21_PM_3.gif\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As I said, Chrome OS 85 is scheduled to arrive today. As of the publishing of this article, we haven&#8217;t seen any sign that the server has updated any devices to 85 but we&#8217;ll keep a close watch and update you when it begins to roll out.

With so many of us working or learning from home, it is imperative that we can access coverage in every corner of our home or office. Google&#8217;s Nest Wi-Fi is one of the best solutions around to do just that. The Nest Wi-Fi router is capable of delivering upwards of 600 Mbps to a single device and it will cover up to 2200 sq. ft. When you toss in an add-on Nest Point, you can cover as much as 3800 sq. ft. and you&#8217;ll get the added bonus of a Google Assistant-enabled smart speaker. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"crp_related crp_related_block  \"><h5>more from Chrome Unboxed</h5><ul><li><a href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/googles-nest-wifi-is-now-available-read-this-before-you-buy/\"    target=\"_blank\"  class=\"post-12559\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  width=\"150\" height=\"150\"  src=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/nestwifipoint-150x150.jpg\" class=\"crp_thumb crp_featured\" alt=\"Google&#039;s Nest Wifi is now available: Read this before you buy\" title=\"Google&#039;s Nest Wifi is now available: Read this before you buy\" /><span class=\"crp_title\">Google&#8217;s Nest Wifi is now available: Read this before you buy</span></a><span class=\"crp_author\">  by <a href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/author/gabe/\">Gabriel Brangers</a></span> </li></ul><div class=\"crp_clear\"></div></div>\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re looking to get a larger space setup for better internet access, Woot! has a deal for you.

&#8211; Google&#8217;s upcoming Chromecast/Android TV dongle &#8211; and how this new take on a streaming device from Google will bring together the companies two differing takes on the smart TV market.  With the flexibility of Chromecast from both a use case and hardware standpoint to the more-robust UI and navigation that Android TV offers (there&#8217;s a remote, after all), <strong>this new device could be the best of both worlds when it does show up later this year.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>With <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://9to5google.com/2020/08/23/two-google-devices-fcc-possibly-sabrina-android-tv-remote/\" target=\"_blank\">what appears to be &#8216;Sabrina&#8217; spotted passing through the FCC</a> just last week, it looks like we won&#8217;t be waiting much longer for this new streaming hardware to arrive.  Everyone&#8217;s expectation is some sort of virtual October event from Google to announce their <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/google-pixel-4a-5g-pixel-5-announcement/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"24033\" target=\"_blank\">already-teased Pixel 4a 5G and Pixel 5 phones</a> and it seems a <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/new-google-home-nest-assistant-speaker-fcc-photos/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"19879\" target=\"_blank\">new Google Home</a> and this new Chromecast/Android TV dongle will join them.

It&#8217;s a bit ambiguous at this point, but <strong>three separate listings show a price for &#8216;Sabrina&#8217; between $49.99 and $59.99,</strong> and honestly, anything in that range is pretty amazing for <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/google-chromecast-ultra-android-tv-dongle-what-we-know/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"19275\" target=\"_blank\">all you&#8217;ll get in this single streamer.</a>  Don&#8217;t forget, you&#8217;ll be able to run Android TV apps and do all the standard streaming stuff you&#8217;d do with a regular Chromecast, too.  I see little reason why this dongle won&#8217;t be fully-capable of giving users a great experience for Stadia and NVIDIA GeForce NOW, too.  Slap on Google Assistant support and there&#8217;s not much this little dongle can&#8217;t do.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"crp_related crp_related_block  \"><h5>more from Chrome Unboxed</h5><ul><li><a href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/google-chromecast-android-tv-remote-sabrina/\"    target=\"_blank\"  class=\"post-18932\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  width=\"150\" height=\"150\"  src=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/chromecastAndroidTVdongleSabrina-150x150.jpg\" class=\"crp_thumb crp_featured\" alt=\"Why Google&#039;s new Chromecast/Android TV dongle could be a massive hit\" title=\"Why Google&#039;s new Chromecast/Android TV dongle could be a massive hit\" /><span class=\"crp_title\">Why Google&#8217;s new Chromecast/Android TV dongle could be a massive hit</span></a><span class=\"crp_author\">  by <a href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/author/robbypayne/\">Robby Payne</a></span> </li></ul><div class=\"crp_clear\"></div></div>\n\n\n<p>You can see a listing over at <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:3Jln4-gWfCQJ:https://www.walmart.com/ip/Bundle-Sabrina-Abbey-Rock-Candy-US/403830906+&#38;cd=2&#38;hl=en&#38;ct=clnk&#38;gl=us\" target=\"_blank\">Walmart&#8217;s website right</a> now for the higher price and Android Police&#8217;s <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://twitter.com/ArtemR/status/1300593308201185280\" target=\"_blank\">Artem Russakovskii tweeted about</a> a confirmed Target availability for the same price as well.

Today, we&#8217;re going to look at how to install and use one of the most popular package management tools for Debian/Ubuntu based operating systems. Synaptic Package Manager is a GUI (graphical user interface) for the in-built APT package management system we covered yesterday. Not only does Synaptic provide a visual interface for the installation, upgrading and removal of packages, but it also gives users the ability to add repositories to access additional packages. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I covered Synaptic Package Manager a few months back. Unfortunately, the updated of the Linux container on Chrome OS to Debian Buster created some dependency issues that prevented it from running properly. After testing our various package managers and software centers, I revisited Synaptic to find it working again with a small tweak or two. <strong>Why would you want to use Synaptic?</strong> Glad you asked. Many Linux users are well-versed in using the terminal to install and run applications and many Linux distros include their own software center for searching and installing packages. You won&#8217;t get that on Linux in Chrome OS. Chromebook users that are interested in exploring new tools and applications via Linux may have little to now experience using command line tools. Synaptic puts a face on the Debian package manager and does a lot of the heavy lifting for the user.

If this is the first time you&#8217;ve used the Linux container, you can find more information on getting started <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/the-command-line-getting-started-with-linux-apps-on-your-chromebook/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"15431\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. All set? Great. Let&#8217;s get started. Synaptic is available from the Debian repository so you don&#8217;t have to do any fancy footwork to get it installed. Open up your Linux terminal and type or paste the following command and hit enter. When prompted, hit &#8220;y&#8221; and enter. </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>sudo apt install synaptic</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Note: </strong><em>If your installation aborts when you hit &#8220;y&#8221; and enter, run the command again but replace <code>apt</code> with <code>apt-get</code> and you should be good to go</em>. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"crp_related crp_related_block  \"><h5>more from Chrome Unboxed</h5><ul><li><a href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/install-synaptic-package-manager-on-you-chromebook/\"    target=\"_blank\"  class=\"post-15582\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  width=\"150\" height=\"150\"  src=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/synapticmanagerchromeos-150x150.jpg\" class=\"crp_thumb crp_featured\" alt=\"[Update] Install Synaptic Package Manager on your Chromebook\" title=\"[Update] Install Synaptic Package Manager on your Chromebook\" /><span class=\"crp_title\">[Update] Install Synaptic Package Manager on your Chromebook</span></a><span class=\"crp_author\">  by <a href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/author/gabe/\">Gabriel Brangers</a></span> </li></ul><div class=\"crp_clear\"></div></div>\n\n\n<p>Now, to run Synaptic you should be able to use the <code>synaptic-pkexec</code> in the terminal. Unfortunately, Linux on Chrome OS is running as a virtual machine using the Chromebook as a host. For various reasons, using this command will run Synaptic without any privileges. That means you won&#8217;t be able to use Synaptic to install or upgrade packages and this will render it all but useless. To overcome this, we&#8217;ll run a different command using <code>sudo</code> but first, we have to give the virtual machine access to the host display or the graphic interface won&#8217;t work. To do this we need to run the following command in the terminal.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>xhost +si:localuser:root</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>The output for this command should be <code>localuser:root being added to access control list</code>. Now we&#8217;re ready to launch Synaptic. You can do this by running the following command in the terminal. </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>sudo synaptic</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Once Synaptic launches, you&#8217;ll be able to find packages by category or you can search by name. Clicking a package won&#8217;t install it automatically, Instead, you will &#8220;mark it for installation&#8221; and you&#8217;ll be prompted to review any necessary dependencies. Once you&#8217;ve mark the packages, simply click &#8220;apply&#8221; and wait for the installation to completer. Since Synaptic is just running &#8220;apt&#8221; commands, you&#8217;ll find your newly installed apps in your app launcher when applicable. To remove a package, just right click an installed package and click &#8220;mark for removal.&#8221; Then, click apply and the package will be removed. Synaptic is a great tool to help you find and install packages while learning your way around the terminal. Next week, we&#8217;ll explore how to add repositories to pull down packages not found in the Buster repository. Stay tuned. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"newsletterSignupBlock\">\n\tGet Alerted About New Posts On <br class=\"forMobileOnly\"><span class=\"highlighter\">Your Schedule</span><br>\n\t<a class=\"BuyButton\" href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/newsletter-sign-up/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sign Up For The Official Chrome Unboxed Newsletter</a>\n<div class=\"divider\"></div>\n<h6>Latest Posts</h6>\n<div class=\"wp-rss-template-container\" data-wpra-template=\"default\" data-template-ctx=\"eyJmZWVkcyI6Im5ld2VzdHBvc3RzIn0=\">\n    <div class=\"wp-rss-aggregator wpra-list-template  \" data-page=\"1\">\n    \n    \n<ul class=\"wpra-item-list rss-aggregator \"\n    start=\"1\">\n                        <li class=\"wpra-item feed-item gurss\">\n            \n            \n\n    <a  href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/usi-stylus-pen-affordable-chromebooks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\">Affordable, stowable USI pens will arrive with the next generation of Chromebooks</a>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wprss-feed-meta\">\n    \n    \n    </div>\n\n            \n        </li>\n                    <li class=\"wpra-item feed-item gurss\">\n            \n            \n\n    <a  href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/the-rare-occasion-we-actually-recommend-a-refurbished-chromebook/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\">The rare occasion we actually recommend a refurbished Chromebook</a>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wprss-feed-meta\">\n    \n    \n    </div>\n\n            \n        </li>\n                    <li class=\"wpra-item feed-item gurss\">\n            \n            \n\n    <a  href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/the-chrome-cast-77-an-exclusive-interview-with-usi-chairman-peter-mueller/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\">The Chrome Cast 77: An exclusive interview with USI Chairman Peter Mueller</a>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wprss-feed-meta\">\n    \n    \n    </div>\n\n            \n        </li>\n                    <li class=\"wpra-item feed-item gurss\">\n            \n            \n\n    <a  href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/new-chromebooks-development-volteer-zork-kukui-dedede\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\">Time to add a ton of Chromebooks to the list of upcoming devices</a>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wprss-feed-meta\">\n    \n    \n    </div>\n\n            \n        </li>\n        </ul>\n\n        \n</div>\n\n</div>\n\n</div>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 30 Aug 2020 01:41:30 +0000","feedId":13345,"bgimg":"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/synapticmanagerchromeos-1-1024x684.jpg","linkMd5":"7bce7e28c10b7a3133057667c7c13f32","destWidth":1024,"destHeight":684,"sourceBytes":59545,"destBytes":22904,"author":"Gabriel Brangers","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/synapticmanagerchromeos-1-1024x684.jpg":null,"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/synaptic-dependencies-1024x760.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn67@2020_1/2020/09/05/08-50-14-553_e2358548f719809c.webp","https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/synapticmanagerchromeos-150x150.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn67@2020_5/2020/09/05/08-50-14-417_459d434ac35f1653.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599295810956},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:10","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:10","title":"Steam gaming on Chromebooks inches closer as new details on install process emerge","link":"https://chromeunboxed.com/?p=25260","description":"<a href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/steam-games-chrome-os-chromebooks-web-install-app-manager\" title=\"Steam gaming on Chromebooks inches closer as new details on install process emerge\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/SteamGamesChromebooksWebInstallAppService-1024x576.jpg\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"display: block;

There have been methods that <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/how-to-install-steam-on-a-chromebook/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"18093\" target=\"_blank\">utilize Linux on Chrome OS</a> in a few different variations and then there&#8217;s the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/chrome-os-geforce-now-web-player-exclusive-important\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"24901\" target=\"_blank\">NVIDIA GeForce NOW approach</a> that recently became available for Chromebook users, but none of those options are what <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/official-steam-support-could-be-headed-to-chromebooks/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"14334\" target=\"_blank\">Kan Liu was speaking of at CES 2020</a> when he made the statement that Steam support for Chrome OS was officially in the works via the Linux container.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, as we&#8217;ve come to find out this summer, <a href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/borealis-steam-valve-gaming-chromebook-container-half-life-aperture-science/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"19806\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">the path to Steam gaming on Chromebooks will likely take the form of a custom container</a> much like what we&#8217;ll see with <a href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/parallels-details-emerge-on-how-windows-will-run-on-chrome-os/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"23995\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Parallels and Windows apps on Chromebooks later this year.</a>  It is the same basic method that the Chrome OS team has used to get Linux apps up and running on Chromebooks, but these custom containers can run different operating systems inside and thus, deliver different experiences for users.  For instance, there&#8217;s a ton of work being done on <a href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/chrome-os-android-11-apps-arcvm-crostini/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ARCVM, which will be a custom Android container that will bring the Android framework to Chromebooks</a> in a manner far more similar to what we see with Linux apps as opposed to the current ARC++ method we currently have.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The custom container that the Chrome OS team is building for this Steam experience goes by the name of Borealis</strong> and there are some really fun details that have emerged in the past week from the Chromium Repositories that shed a bit more light on what the Steam experience will be like once it does land on Chrome OS.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>There will be a web-based installer</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>First up, it is becoming clear that there will be a web-based install method for users to get Steam up and running.  This makes sense as the current install method for Steam revolves around <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/about/\" target=\"_blank\">heading to their installer page,</a> choosing your platform, and beginning an install process from there.  From what we&#8217;re seeing in the repositories, <a href=\"https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/2391891\">there will be a web-driven process that will get the entire installer up and running for Chromebooks.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><a href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot-2020-09-03-at-2.25.19-PM.png\"><img data-attachment-id=\"25263\" data-permalink=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/steam-games-chrome-os-chromebooks-web-install-app-manager/screenshot-2020-09-03-at-2-25-19-pm/\" data-orig-file=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot-2020-09-03-at-2.25.19-PM.png\" data-orig-size=\"766,1036\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&#34;aperture&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;credit&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;camera&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;caption&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;created_timestamp&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;copyright&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;focal_length&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;iso&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;shutter_speed&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;title&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;orientation&#34;:&#34;0&#34;}\" data-image-title=\"Screenshot-2020-09-03-at-2.25.19-PM\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot-2020-09-03-at-2.25.19-PM-222x300.png\" data-large-file=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot-2020-09-03-at-2.25.19-PM-757x1024.png\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot-2020-09-03-at-2.25.19-PM-757x1024.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-25263\" width=\"627\" height=\"848\" srcset=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot-2020-09-03-at-2.25.19-PM-757x1024.png 757w, https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot-2020-09-03-at-2.25.19-PM-222x300.png 222w, https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot-2020-09-03-at-2.25.19-PM.png 766w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 627px) 100vw, 627px\" /></a><figcaption><a href=\"https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/2391891\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">via the Chromium Gerrit</a></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>As you can see in these strings for the web install flow, there is language about <strong>setup, install, completion, VM configurations, errors, and launching.</strong>  Much of this is similar to the flow we see when Linux apps are turned on for a particular Chromebook and that shouldn&#8217;t come as a surprise.  The bigger deal here is the fact that <strong>this install process looks to be originating from a download via a web interface.</strong>  Ideally, users will click the install button, open a file, and the container install and setup will take care of itself.  It is unclear at this time whether or not the native ability to turn on Borealis will be there in the Chrome OS settings like we see with Android apps and Linux apps.  Since they are clearly setting up a web installer to get things going, I&#8217;d wager the answer is no.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Installed games will be handled like all other apps on a Chromebook</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;d argue that this next tidbit is even more impressive than the web installer.  <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/2362102/5/components/services/app_service/public/mojom/types.mojom\" target=\"_blank\">From the looks of what we&#8217;re seeing,</a> Steam games you install via the Borealis method will be standalone apps in your app drawer just like any other thing you install on a Chromebook.

In those cases, Chrome OS needs a fill-in icon to put in its place.  <a href=\"https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/2377770\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Thanks to the commit for this,</a> we have a basic, simple idea of what the logo for the Borealis project looks like.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img data-attachment-id=\"25266\" data-permalink=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/steam-games-chrome-os-chromebooks-web-install-app-manager/borealis/\" data-orig-file=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/borealis.png\" data-orig-size=\"192,192\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&#34;aperture&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;credit&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;camera&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;caption&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;created_timestamp&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;copyright&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;focal_length&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;iso&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;shutter_speed&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;title&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;orientation&#34;:&#34;0&#34;}\" data-image-title=\"borealis\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/borealis.png\" data-large-file=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/borealis.png\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"192\" height=\"192\" src=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/borealis.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-25266\" srcset=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/borealis.png 192w, https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/borealis-150x150.png 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 192px) 100vw, 192px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Simple, but still pretty cool, right?  This will likely stand in as the icon during the download/install process and will show up in your App menu in settings or in your app drawer any time a game doesn&#8217;t come equipped with a properly-oriented icon of its own.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Still work to be done</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>From the looks of the repositories right now, there&#8217;s likely a ton more work to be done before any of this hits open testing phases.  I don&#8217;t have a timeline in mind, but if we see anything before the end of the year, I&#8217;d be shocked.  Granted, a ton of the VM work and plumbing is already in place thanks to the years of work the Chrome OS team has done on the Crostini Project that brings Linux apps to Chromebooks.  Perhaps as this is simply a modified container, the work won&#8217;t be anywhere close to as intense for Borealis as it was for Crostini, <strong>but don&#8217;t expect anything too soon. </strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s encouraging that tests are happening with the web installer and that we&#8217;re already talking about app icons and inclusion in the App Service, but I&#8217;d say we&#8217;re months out at this point from seeing Steam appear on Chromebooks.  When it does, however, <a href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/google-pixelbook-2-halvor-usb-4-thunderbolt\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"25252\">Tiger Lake Chromebooks (like the hopeful Pixelbook 2)</a> and maybe even some <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/amd-ryzen-chromebooks-soon-benchmark-score-increase\" target=\"_blank\">AMD-powered Chromebooks</a> will be around and ready to offer up their far-superior GPUs to users, making for some pretty sweet, local gaming action on Chromebooks.  <strong>Who would have ever thought?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<img

repeating. Buying a Chromebook right now is a mind-searing undertaking. Finding even a decent device for you or your student is near impossible unless you&#8217;re willing to pay hundreds of dollars over retail and you can forget finding a big sale at the moment. Stores like Best Buy can barely keep inventory and Amazon is rife with third-party sellers that have snatched up Chromebooks at retail or on sale and are now charging outlandish prices knowing they can take advantage of desperate shoppers.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/patreonInContentDesktop.jpg\" class=\"patreonDesktop\">\n\n\n\n<p>That said, one of the most value-minded devices has just returned to Amazon at its original MSRP and you can grab one if you act very fast. The Lenovo Chromebook Flex 5 retails for $409 and offers many of the premium and powerful specs that come with more expensive devices such as the Acer Spin 713 and Samsung Galaxy Chromebook. Since its launch, the 13.3&#8243; Flex 5 2-in-1 Chromebook has been a hot item that gets snatched up every time it pops up on Amazon for this price. Over the past few weeks, demand has driven prices for the Flex 5 as high as $700. Thankfully, it appears that Amazon has gotten some back in stock and you can get one while supplies last. They are limited to 2 per order and I&#8217;d bet they&#8217;ll be gone before the end of the day. If you need a great Chromebook and don&#8217;t want to feel like you&#8217;ve been robbed, this is the best thing out there at the moment. Find the Lenovo Chromebook Flex 5 by heading to the Chrome Shop at the Link below. <strong>Note: If you don&#8217;t see the $409 listing, click &#8220;all buying options&#8221; and find the one that&#8217;s sold and shipped by Amazon</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://chrmshop.com/lenovo-chromebook-flex-5/\" class=\"BuyButton\" target=\"_blank\">Lenovo Chromebook Flex 5 on Chrome Shop</a></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"newsletterSignupBlock\">\n\tGet Alerted About New Posts On <br class=\"forMobileOnly\"><span class=\"highlighter\">Your Schedule</span><br>\n\t<a class=\"BuyButton\" href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/newsletter-sign-up/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sign Up For The Official Chrome Unboxed Newsletter</a>\n<div class=\"divider\"></div>\n<h6>Latest Posts</h6>\n<div class=\"wp-rss-template-container\" data-wpra-template=\"default\" data-template-ctx=\"eyJmZWVkcyI6Im5ld2VzdHBvc3RzIn0=\">\n    <div class=\"wp-rss-aggregator wpra-list-template  \" data-page=\"1\">\n    \n    \n<ul class=\"wpra-item-list rss-aggregator \"\n    start=\"1\">\n                        <li class=\"wpra-item feed-item gurss\">\n            \n            \n\n    <a  href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/usi-stylus-pen-affordable-chromebooks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\">Affordable, stowable USI pens will arrive with the next generation of Chromebooks</a>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wprss-feed-meta\">\n    \n    \n    </div>\n\n            \n        </li>\n                    <li class=\"wpra-item feed-item gurss\">\n            \n            \n\n    <a  href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/the-rare-occasion-we-actually-recommend-a-refurbished-chromebook/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\">The rare occasion we actually recommend a refurbished Chromebook</a>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wprss-feed-meta\">\n    \n    \n    </div>\n\n            \n        </li>\n                    <li class=\"wpra-item feed-item gurss\">\n            \n            \n\n    <a  href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/the-chrome-cast-77-an-exclusive-interview-with-usi-chairman-peter-mueller/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\">The Chrome Cast 77: An exclusive interview with USI Chairman Peter Mueller</a>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wprss-feed-meta\">\n    \n    \n    </div>\n\n            \n        </li>\n                    <li class=\"wpra-item feed-item gurss\">\n            \n            \n\n    <a  href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/new-chromebooks-development-volteer-zork-kukui-dedede\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\">Time to add a ton of Chromebooks to the list of upcoming devices</a>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wprss-feed-meta\">\n    \n    \n    </div>\n\n            \n        </li>\n        </ul>\n\n        \n</div>\n\n</div>\n\n</div>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 03 Sep 2020 18:30:30 +0000","feedId":13345,"bgimg":"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/LenovoFlex5ChromebookReview-1024x576.jpg","linkMd5":"b85c582efb56db2935de80371e96660e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn46@2020_1/2020/09/05/08-50-11-409_a6b993315259c7c0.webp","destWidth":1024,"destHeight":576,"sourceBytes":48538,"destBytes":26922,"author":"Gabriel Brangers","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/LenovoFlex5ChromebookReview-1024x576.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn46@2020_1/2020/09/05/08-50-11-409_a6b993315259c7c0.webp","https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/patreonInContentDesktop.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn34@2020_5/2020/09/05/08-50-16-094_3e3fd54965f36783.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599295810954},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:10","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:10","title":"We are excited to officially announce the Chrome Unboxed Patreon Community","link":"https://chromeunboxed.com/?p=25162","description":"<a href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/patreon-community-launch-chrome-unboxed\" title=\"We are excited to officially announce the Chrome Unboxed Patreon Community\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"577\" src=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/PatreonChromeUnboxedLaunch-1024x577.jpg\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"display: block;

There&#8217;s a little something for everyone and, at the same time, we get the opportunity as content creators to be <em>a bit less ad-funded and a bit more audience oriented.</em>  We tried in the past year to do something similar with YouTube Membership, but the platform simply didn&#8217;t offer all the connections we were after.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"We&#039;re Officially Launching a Patreon Community: Here&#039;s Why\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0AbpMgBr91c?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In the move to Patreon, we now have multiple contribution tiers with all sorts of great options when it comes to ways for us to connect to you all as our audience.  We extended the option of Patreon to our existing YouTube Membership group about a month ago, so we&#8217;ve been able to see Patreon in action already and <strong>it has been an absolute blast.</strong> Probably the group favorite right now is the access to our private Discord server, where the already-growing community is able to not only connect to us here at Chrome Unboxed, but with one another as well.  <strong>It&#8217;s been a ton of fun!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are multiple tiers you can join, giving you access to things like <strong>behind-the-scenes footage, early access to videos, private Discord server access, an ad-free experience on the mobile and desktop versions of the website, your name listed on all our YouTube videos, and monthly live stream Q&#38;A.</strong>  You can head over to <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/chromeunboxed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">patreon.com/chromeunboxed</a> to see the breakdown on the different levels to see which is right for you if you are interested.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/patreonInContentDesktop.jpg\" class=\"patreonDesktop\">\n<img src=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/patreonInContentMobile.jpg\" class=\"patreonMobile\">\n\n\n\n<p>For us, this all means we now have a simple-to-manage, easy-access way to deliver unique content to our most loyal fans and a much better way to interact with each of you.  With comment threads on the site and on YouTube, that just isn&#8217;t realistic and its not a great experience.  With Patreon, we&#8217;re very excited by the potential of this community and where we&#8217;ll be in 6 months or a year from now.  We hope you join and we hope you enjoy it all as much as we&#8217;ve enjoyed preparing all this.

When it comes down to hardware, there is little to differentiate Google&#8217;s own Chromebooks from those made by other manufacturers apart from hardware keys on the device, and as I was excited by the Assistant key appearing on &#8216;Halvor&#8217;, <strong>I looked right past another important key being included.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The humble play/pause button on Chromebooks is a relatively-new addition that only began with the Pixelbook.  It is part of what we all thought would be a new keyboard layout for Chromebooks moving forward after the launch of that device.  Oddly-enough, we didn&#8217;t see this particular layout again until the Pixel Slate a year later and not again until the Pixelbook Go a year after that.  There have been a few variations on the Chrome OS keyboard, like what we saw in <a href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/dell-latitude-chromebook-enterprise-review-expensive-consumers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Dell&#8217;s 2019 enterprise-focused, VM-ready Latitude Chromebooks,</a> but there have been no other sightings of the exact top-row layout that the Google devices carry on any other Chromebooks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While it is worth noting that the two third-party keyboards that have the Assistant key built in (Logitech K580 and Brydge C-Type) also get this unique top-row layout with the play/pause button added, <strong>no Chromebook has come with it built in except Google&#8217;s own devices. </strong> I went back and looked at videos and images of all the Chromebooks we&#8217;ve reviewed in the past few years and, much to my surprise, there was no other device with this setup.  <strong>Until &#8216;Halvor&#8217;, that is.</strong>  <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromiumos/platform/ec/+/2366317/5/board/halvor/board.c\" target=\"_blank\">According to this commit,</a> the layout of the keyboard for &#8216;Halvor&#8217; will match Google&#8217;s own Chromebooks down to the last key.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img data-attachment-id=\"25067\" data-permalink=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/halvor-pixelbook-2-chromebook-made-by-google/screenshot-2020-08-31-at-10-06-04-am/\" data-orig-file=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-08-31-at-10.06.04-AM.png\" data-orig-size=\"464,352\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&#34;aperture&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;credit&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;camera&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;caption&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;created_timestamp&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;copyright&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;focal_length&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;iso&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;shutter_speed&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;title&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;orientation&#34;:&#34;0&#34;}\" data-image-title=\"Screenshot-2020-08-31-at-10.06.04-AM\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-08-31-at-10.06.04-AM-300x228.png\" data-large-file=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-08-31-at-10.06.04-AM.png\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"464\" height=\"352\" src=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-08-31-at-10.06.04-AM.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-25067\" srcset=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-08-31-at-10.06.04-AM.png 464w, https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-08-31-at-10.06.04-AM-300x228.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 464px) 100vw, 464px\" /><figcaption><a href=\"https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromiumos/platform/ec/+/2366317/5/board/halvor/board.c#67\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">via the Chromium Gerrit</a></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Is this firm proof that &#8216;Halvor&#8217; is made by Google?  No, just like the addition of the Assistant key isn&#8217;t.</strong>  And as I&#8217;m fully aware of the existence of confirmation bias, I can&#8217;t even completely say that I&#8217;m not falling prey to it right now.  I&#8217;m looking in every nook and cranny for more proof that &#8216;Halvor&#8217; is made by Google not because I want to be right (I obviously do), but because I have a deep, deep desire for Google to show up with a Chromebook for us to love this year.  We&#8217;ll keep digging and we&#8217;re hoping we end up finding a smoking gun, but I&#8217;m also prepared to just be a hopeful Google fan going into October this year.  Who knows, may Stephen Hall over at 9to5 Google will just get this device before then and <a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2019/10/10/exclusive-this-is-google-pixelbook-go-gallery/\">leak it all out like he did with the Pixelbook Go.</a>  <strong>A guy can hope, right?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://chrmshop.com/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"BuyButton\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Shop Best Chromebooks of 2020 So Far on Chrome Shop</a></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"newsletterSignupBlock\">\n\tGet Alerted About New Posts On <br class=\"forMobileOnly\"><span class=\"highlighter\">Your Schedule</span><br>\n\t<a class=\"BuyButton\" href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/newsletter-sign-up/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sign Up For The Official Chrome Unboxed Newsletter</a>\n<div class=\"divider\"></div>\n<h6>Latest Posts</h6>\n<div class=\"wp-rss-template-container\" data-wpra-template=\"default\" data-template-ctx=\"eyJmZWVkcyI6Im5ld2VzdHBvc3RzIn0=\">\n    <div class=\"wp-rss-aggregator wpra-list-template  \" data-page=\"1\">\n    \n    \n<ul class=\"wpra-item-list rss-aggregator \"\n    start=\"1\">\n                        <li class=\"wpra-item feed-item gurss\">\n            \n            \n\n    <a  href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/usi-stylus-pen-affordable-chromebooks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\">Affordable, stowable USI pens will arrive with the next generation of Chromebooks</a>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wprss-feed-meta\">\n    \n    \n    </div>\n\n            \n        </li>\n                    <li class=\"wpra-item feed-item gurss\">\n            \n            \n\n    <a  href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/the-rare-occasion-we-actually-recommend-a-refurbished-chromebook/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\">The rare occasion we actually recommend a refurbished Chromebook</a>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wprss-feed-meta\">\n    \n    \n    </div>\n\n            \n        </li>\n                    <li class=\"wpra-item feed-item gurss\">\n            \n            \n\n    <a  href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/the-chrome-cast-77-an-exclusive-interview-with-usi-chairman-peter-mueller/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\">The Chrome Cast 77: An exclusive interview with USI Chairman Peter Mueller</a>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wprss-feed-meta\">\n    \n    \n    </div>\n\n            \n        </li>\n                    <li class=\"wpra-item feed-item gurss\">\n            \n            \n\n    <a  href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/new-chromebooks-development-volteer-zork-kukui-dedede\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\">Time to add a ton of Chromebooks to the list of upcoming devices</a>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wprss-feed-meta\">\n    \n    \n    </div>\n\n            \n        </li>\n        </ul>\n\n        \n</div>\n\n</div>\n\n</div>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 31 Aug 2020 14:18:26 +0000","feedId":13345,"bgimg":"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PixelbookFam-1024x682.jpg","linkMd5":"14a021c268a8dab1ac4fa533d1a20b38","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn37@2020_6/2020/09/05/08-50-11-543_a5b046e7d751b1e6.webp","destWidth":1024,"destHeight":682,"sourceBytes":80719,"destBytes":46080,"author":"Robby Payne","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PixelbookFam-1024x682.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn37@2020_6/2020/09/05/08-50-11-543_a5b046e7d751b1e6.webp","https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-08-31-at-10.06.04-AM.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn75@2020_6/2020/09/05/08-50-14-775_43055063682706f0.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599295810955},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:10","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:10","title":"Much-improved benchmark scores hint flagship AMD Chromebooks could be here soon","link":"https://chromeunboxed.com/?p=25129","description":"<a href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/amd-ryzen-chromebooks-soon-benchmark-score-increase\" title=\"Much-improved benchmark scores hint flagship AMD Chromebooks could be here soon\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"575\" src=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AMDchromebooksNewFamilyZork-1024x575.jpg\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"display: block;

We&#8217;re way more excited by the far-more-powerful Ryzen chips that PCs and laptops running Windows get to take advantage of.  AMD&#8217;s lower prices and similar performance are a great fit for Chrome OS when compared to Intel, but <strong>the path has been long as we&#8217;ve waited for these Chromebooks to arrive.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://browser.geekbench.com/v4/cpu/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&#38;q=zork\" target=\"_blank\">I just came across a new benchmark from yesterday (August 31st 2020) over on Geekbench</a> that tells me we may not be waiting much longer for these devices to finally show up.  You see, back when the original benchmarks showed up for the full-powered AMD Chromebooks, <strong>the multi-core scores didn&#8217;t look so hot.</strong> With most of the current-gen Intel Chromebooks like the Acer Chromebook Spin 713, single-core scores are in the 4000-5000 range and the multi-core scores fall in the 13,000-14,000 range.  When the AMD-powered &#8216;Trembyle&#8217; device showed up in April over on Geekbench, the single-core scores checked out, but the multi-core score was a fraction of what we&#8217;d expect from a true Intel competitor at only 7000-8000. <strong> It didn&#8217;t look good.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fast forward to this latest benchmark, however, and things are looking far, far better.  With a current score of 4059 on single-core and 13303 on multi-core, &#8216;Trembyle&#8217; (based on the &#8216;Zork&#8217; unibuild) looks way more competitive with the current crop of higher-end Chromebooks.  This is more in line with what we expect of the Ryzen 3700C processor that will ship in many of these AMD Chromebooks whenever they do show up.  Keep in mind, these Chromebooks will also come equipped with Radeon Vega Mobile GPU as well, giving them a graphic leg-up on basically anything else on the market until Tiger Lake Chromebooks start showing up later this year and early in 2021 with Intel&#8217;s new Xe integrated GPUs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>With these increased scores comes an increased expectation that we&#8217;ll begin seeing Chromebooks with AMD chips inside sooner than later.</strong>  It seems the kinks are getting ironed out for these chipsets and perhaps we&#8217;re finally getting closer to seeing what a Chromebook with an AMD processor and GPU can really do.  It is a general trend to see Chromebook benchmarks get better as they approach an actual public launch, so these score increases likely mean we&#8217;re getting much, much closer to seeing a manufacturer announce an AMD-powered Chromebook.  I certainly hope so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://chrmshop.com/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"BuyButton\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Shop Best Chromebooks of 2020 So Far on Chrome Shop</a></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"newsletterSignupBlock\">\n\tGet Alerted About New Posts On <br class=\"forMobileOnly\"><span class=\"highlighter\">Your Schedule</span><br>\n\t<a class=\"BuyButton\" href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/newsletter-sign-up/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sign Up For The Official Chrome Unboxed Newsletter</a>\n<div class=\"divider\"></div>\n<h6>Latest Posts</h6>\n<div class=\"wp-rss-template-container\" data-wpra-template=\"default\" data-template-ctx=\"eyJmZWVkcyI6Im5ld2VzdHBvc3RzIn0=\">\n    <div class=\"wp-rss-aggregator wpra-list-template  \" data-page=\"1\">\n    \n    \n<ul class=\"wpra-item-list rss-aggregator \"\n    start=\"1\">\n                        <li class=\"wpra-item feed-item gurss\">\n            \n            \n\n    <a  href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/usi-stylus-pen-affordable-chromebooks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\">Affordable, stowable USI pens will arrive with the next generation of Chromebooks</a>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wprss-feed-meta\">\n    \n    \n    </div>\n\n            \n        </li>\n                    <li class=\"wpra-item feed-item gurss\">\n            \n            \n\n    <a  href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/the-rare-occasion-we-actually-recommend-a-refurbished-chromebook/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\">The rare occasion we actually recommend a refurbished Chromebook</a>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wprss-feed-meta\">\n    \n    \n    </div>\n\n            \n        </li>\n                    <li class=\"wpra-item feed-item gurss\">\n            \n            \n\n    <a  href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/the-chrome-cast-77-an-exclusive-interview-with-usi-chairman-peter-mueller/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\">The Chrome Cast 77: An exclusive interview with USI Chairman Peter Mueller</a>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wprss-feed-meta\">\n    \n    \n    </div>\n\n            \n        </li>\n                    <li class=\"wpra-item feed-item gurss\">\n            \n            \n\n    <a  href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/new-chromebooks-development-volteer-zork-kukui-dedede\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\">Time to add a ton of Chromebooks to the list of upcoming devices</a>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wprss-feed-meta\">\n    \n    \n    </div>\n\n            \n        </li>\n        </ul>\n\n        \n</div>\n\n</div>\n\n</div>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 01 Sep 2020 15:21:31 +0000","feedId":13345,"bgimg":"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AMDchromebooksNewFamilyZork-1024x575.jpg","linkMd5":"059c8f8b83704f54dc3cb1abbf42af31","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn42@2020_6/2020/09/05/08-50-11-567_a6c72edd8da09dce.webp","destWidth":1024,"destHeight":575,"sourceBytes":32679,"destBytes":14846,"author":"Robby Payne","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AMDchromebooksNewFamilyZork-1024x575.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn42@2020_6/2020/09/05/08-50-11-567_a6c72edd8da09dce.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599295810955},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:10","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:10","title":"The upcoming Phone Hub for Chromebooks is getting another awesome feature","link":"https://chromeunboxed.com/?p=24994","description":"<a href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/google-phone-hub-chromebook-android-find-my-phone\" title=\"The upcoming Phone Hub for Chromebooks is getting another awesome feature\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ChromeOSAndroidPhoneHubFeature-1024x576.jpg\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"display: block;

At this point, we&#8217;re aware that the service will act as a deeper link between your Chromebook and Android phone by allowing users to share notifications between Chrome OS and Android and also give users the option to continue tasks when moving from phone to Chromebook.  While we&#8217;re not completely sure how it will all work, <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/chromebook-android-phone-hub-notifications-integration\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"24505\" target=\"_blank\">it is apparent that the feature is moving along fast</a> and today we have a new addition to the Phone Hub&#8217;s growing arsenal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.chromestory.com/2020/08/chromebook-ring-phone/\" target=\"_blank\">Found by Chrome Story,</a> a new ability being added to the Phone Hub will allow users to ring their Android phone at full volume if/when it has been misplaced.  As a frequent user of this feature on the Google Assistant side of things (you can ask any Assistant device to do this same task), I&#8217;m excited to see this added to the Phone Hub.  It is worth noting that you can ask the Assistant on your Chromebook to do the same thing right now, but also understood that not everyone uses the Assistant and may still want to have the ability to ring their phone when it is misplaced.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those wanting to simply hit a button and find their phone, this will be another great addition to the growing list of valuable functionality that the upcoming Phone Hub will bring to Chromebook users.  As this whole Android phone + Chromebook movement continues to push forward, I&#8217;m looking very forward to the day when my phone and Chromebook seamlessly work off of one another a bit more harmoniously.  It will be yet another reason for consumers to consider a Chromebook as their next purchase, for sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://chrmshop.com/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"BuyButton\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Shop Best Chromebooks of 2020 So Far on Chrome Shop</a></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"newsletterSignupBlock\">\n\tGet Alerted About New Posts On <br class=\"forMobileOnly\"><span class=\"highlighter\">Your Schedule</span><br>\n\t<a class=\"BuyButton\" href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/newsletter-sign-up/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sign Up For The Official Chrome Unboxed Newsletter</a>\n<div class=\"divider\"></div>\n<h6>Latest Posts</h6>\n<div class=\"wp-rss-template-container\" data-wpra-template=\"default\" data-template-ctx=\"eyJmZWVkcyI6Im5ld2VzdHBvc3RzIn0=\">\n    <div class=\"wp-rss-aggregator wpra-list-template  \" data-page=\"1\">\n    \n    \n<ul class=\"wpra-item-list rss-aggregator \"\n    start=\"1\">\n                        <li class=\"wpra-item feed-item gurss\">\n            \n            \n\n    <a  href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/usi-stylus-pen-affordable-chromebooks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\">Affordable, stowable USI pens will arrive with the next generation of Chromebooks</a>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wprss-feed-meta\">\n    \n    \n    </div>\n\n            \n        </li>\n                    <li class=\"wpra-item feed-item gurss\">\n            \n            \n\n    <a  href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/the-rare-occasion-we-actually-recommend-a-refurbished-chromebook/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\">The rare occasion we actually recommend a refurbished Chromebook</a>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wprss-feed-meta\">\n    \n    \n    </div>\n\n            \n        </li>\n                    <li class=\"wpra-item feed-item gurss\">\n            \n            \n\n    <a  href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/the-chrome-cast-77-an-exclusive-interview-with-usi-chairman-peter-mueller/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\">The Chrome Cast 77: An exclusive interview with USI Chairman Peter Mueller</a>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wprss-feed-meta\">\n    \n    \n    </div>\n\n            \n        </li>\n                    <li class=\"wpra-item feed-item gurss\">\n            \n            \n\n    <a  href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/new-chromebooks-development-volteer-zork-kukui-dedede\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\">Time to add a ton of Chromebooks to the list of upcoming devices</a>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wprss-feed-meta\">\n    \n    \n    </div>\n\n            \n        </li>\n        </ul>\n\n        \n</div>\n\n</div>\n\n</div>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 28 Aug 2020 19:46:24 +0000","feedId":13345,"bgimg":"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ChromeOSAndroidPhoneHubFeature-1024x576.jpg","linkMd5":"47e49612f872e45c644497454c9e9165","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn17@2020_2/2020/09/05/08-50-11-737_149ed5ac97852cfa.webp","destWidth":1024,"destHeight":576,"sourceBytes":46378,"destBytes":21404,"author":"Robby Payne","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ChromeOSAndroidPhoneHubFeature-1024x576.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn17@2020_2/2020/09/05/08-50-11-737_149ed5ac97852cfa.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599295810956},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:10","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:10","title":"Proof that Google may be making a Pixelbook 2 for 2020 after all","link":"https://chromeunboxed.com/?p=24972","description":"<a href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/google-pixelbook-2-assistant-key-proof-halvor-tiger-lake\" title=\"Proof that Google may be making a Pixelbook 2 for 2020 after all\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/PixelbookSlateFeature-1024x682.jpg\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"display: block;

Without question, there are more upcoming devices in development in the Chromebook world right now than there ever have been at any point in history.</p> \n<p>Yet, there’s one Chromebook many of us have been on the hunt for week after week that has yet to show itself: <strong>the next #madebyGoogle Chromebook.</strong> Not long ago, I’d even conceded the fact that <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/google-pixelbook-2-not-happening-soon/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"20097\" target=\"_blank\">Google may not be making a new Chromebook in-house for the </a><a href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/google-pixelbook-2-not-happening-soon/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"20097\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">foreseeable</a><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/google-pixelbook-2-not-happening-soon/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"20097\" target=\"_blank\"> future.</a> When you look at how the ecosystem is thriving right now, who could blame them if they just sat out for a year or two? After all, if Google’s intention was to ultimately set the bar for Chromebook manufacturers with the Pixelbook, Pixel Slate and Pixelbook Go, <strong>I think we’d all agree that their mission is accomplished at this point.</strong></p> \n<p>While I think all of that is true, as a big fan of Google’s hardware, <strong>I simply don’t care.</strong> I don’t care if Google did their part and put manufacturers on a good trajectory. I don’t care if Google accomplished what they set out to do. I don’t care if there isn’t a market need for a new Pixelbook: the fact of the matter is <strong>I want one.</strong> And I’m not alone, here. I see comments and receive emails constantly about users who want a new Chromebook and want one that is designed by Google. That’s not to throw shade on other Chromebooks. I love the Acer Spin 713 I’m typing this on right now, but <strong>it’s no Pixelbook. Nothing quite is.</strong></p> \n<p>There’s something that’s just inherently better about Google’s own Chromebooks: an attention to detail, a quality of build, and a thoughtfulness of design that not only is attractive at launch, but stands the test of time. Take a look at a Pixelbook the next time you see one and <strong>tell me another 3-year-old laptop that looks as distinctive yet is still just as aesthetically pleasing as it was on day one.</strong> I’ll save you some time: there’s nothing quite like it. Even the 7-year-old Chromebook Pixel retains an air of modernity few laptops can boast from that time. The current Pixelbook Go is designed in the same vein and every time I pick it up, I have an impulsive desire to just return to it again because of the way it looks and feels. Every time.</p> \n<h2>Proof another Pixelbook may be coming this year</h2> \n<p>Some of you may think I’m crazy, but if you’ve fallen in love with a Google-made Chromebook, you know exactly what I’m talking about and <strong>you should be as excited as I am about the fact that we have some pretty solid proof that a new Google Chromebook is in the works</strong> and could realistically be launched by the end of this year just like the past 3 in-house Google laptops before it.</p> \n<p>Say hello again to ‘Halvor’ and if – like me – <a href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/3-new-chromebooks-development-boards-tiger-lake-jasper-lake-intel/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"19886\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">you brushed by this baseboard when we originally reported on it,</a> don’t beat yourself up. You see, ‘Halvor’ is one of an absolute gaggle of new Chromebooks coming that is based on the ‘Volteer’ baseboard. ‘Volteer’ is the main board that is being used to usher in <a href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/chrome-os-begins-prepping-for-intels-10nm-tiger-lake-cpu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">the era of Intel Tiger Lake Chromebooks.</a> These devices will have things like <a href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/chromebooks-graphics-gpu-intel-tiger-lake-powerful/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Intel’s new Xe integrated graphics,</a> <a href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/chrome-os-begins-prepping-for-intels-10nm-tiger-lake-cpu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">a 10nm process for faster speeds and improved battery life,</a> <a href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/chromebooks-4k-tiger-lake-volteer-development/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">support for 4K screens,</a> <a href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/chromebooks-webcam-1080p-hdr-low-light-volteer-tiger-lake-intel/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">better webcams,</a> and <a href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/chrome-os-prepares-to-embrace-usb-4-0/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">USB 4.</a> Overall, they will be a fantastic update to the current Chromebooks being launched in 2020 so far and will be the next generation that will carry the flagship banner for Chrome OS into 2021.</p> \n<p><strong>Now that we have re-introductions covered, let’s get to the evidence.</strong> Tonight as I was browsing through the Chromium Repositories, I came across a commit that contained the message I’ve been seeking for months at this point: <strong>a message about the Assistant key.</strong> You see, the only Chromebooks ever made with the dedicated Assistant key up to this point are all Google-made devices. The Pixelbook began the trend in 2017, followed by the Pixel Slate in 2018 and the Pixelbook Go in 2019. Sure, there are a couple Chrome OS keyboards with this special key (Brydge and Logitech make them), but <strong>no Chromebooks other than Google’s own possess it. ‘Halvor’ is the lone exception:</strong></p> \n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n <p>Volteer: add support for ASSISTANT key on Halvor </p>\n <p>Halvor uses the METAL DOME keyboard, which supports ASSISTANT key. </p>\n <p>BUG=<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://issuetracker.google.com/166194260\" target=\"_blank\">b:166194260</a> TEST=scp 81-halvor-keyboard.hwdb into /etc/udev/hwdb.d udevadm hwdb –update reboot DUT, then to launch Google Assistant with ASSISTANT key</p>\n <cite><a href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/?p=24972/166194260\nTEST=scp 81-halvor-keyboard.hwdb into /etc/udev/hwdb.d\n     udevadm hwdb --update\n     reboot DUT, then to luanch Google Assistant with ASSISTANT ke\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">via the Chromium Gerrit</a></cite>\n</blockquote> \n<p>Add to this commit the fact that this change is being made for only one ‘Volteer’ device in ‘Halvor’ instead of across the board for all the ‘Volteer’ derivatives and you have some pretty good evidence that we’re looking at Google’s next Chromebook. We thought at one time we’d see all Chromebooks begin shipping with an Assistant key on the keyboard, but that has simply not been the case. For whatever reason, Google has always kept this to themselves and it is this fact that makes us feel very confident that ‘Halvor’ is a <strong>#madebyGoogle</strong> Chromebook.</p> \n<h2>The ‘Halvor’ timeline stacks up, too</h2> \n<p>There are a few more points that line up very well with a Pixelbook storyline for ‘Halvor’ if you look a bit deeper. First up is the overall timeline. With the Assistant key addition being added just a couple days ago, I was a bit dubious that this device could possibly show up in the fall like other Pixelbooks have. However, when you look at the timelines of other Google Chromebooks, ‘Halvor’ has had plenty of time for development, <a href=\"https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromiumos/third_party/coreboot/+/2126765\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">beginning it’s life in March of 2020</a> and being based on ‘Volteer’ that began all the way back in September of 2019.</p> \n<div class=\"crp_related crp_related_block  \">\n <h5>more from Chrome Unboxed</h5>\n <ul>\n  <li><a href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/chromebooks-upcoming-development-boards-devices-chrome-os/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"post-18348\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/NewWaveChromebooksEarly2020-150x150.jpg\" class=\"crp_thumb crp_featured\" alt=\"All the upcoming Chrome OS devices and boards we're tracking right now [UPDATE: 7/9/2020]\" title=\"All the upcoming Chrome OS devices and boards we're tracking right now [UPDATE: 7/9/2020]\" /><span class=\"crp_title\">All the upcoming Chrome OS devices and boards we’re tracking right now [UPDATE: 7/9/2020]</span></a><span class=\"crp_author\"> by <a href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/author/robbypayne/\">Robby Payne</a></span> </li>\n </ul>\n <div class=\"crp_clear\"></div>\n</div> \n<p>For reference, the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromiumos/chromite/+/1014264\" target=\"_blank\">Pixel Slate began life in April of 2018</a> and launched in the fall of that year. For a device on a fresh, new baseboard (the Pixelbook Go would ride that same board into 2019) to start in April and ship in November is pretty impressive, honestly. The Slate was no standard device, either, and had to clear the hurdles of a new display, a new form factor, and a custom keyboard solution. <strong>Come to think of it, that’s probably why it’s launch was a bit of a mess.</strong></p> \n<p>Going back to the original Pixelbook, the <a href=\"https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromiumos/overlays/board-overlays/+/544794\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Assistant key was added to it in late June the year it was launched.</a> Back then, the Assistant on a Chromebook wasn’t even a thing, so the fact that Google added the key to the keyboard only 3 months before they announced the Pixelbook tells me that this step is not essential to the overall development cycle of a device. After all, the difference in timing on the Pixelbook and ‘Halvor’ for adding the Assistant key is only two months. <strong>With the Assistant being settled in on Chrome OS at this point, a later addition isn’t actually surprising at all.</strong></p> \n<p>Finally, a Tiger Lake Chromebook is a logical fit for the next Pixelbook and why<strong> I think we could be looking at a Pixelbook 2 instead of something like a Pixelbook Go. </strong> The Pixelbook Go launched with a processor that was over a year old at the time to keep pricing down, so the fact that ‘Halvor’ is being built with the best available silicon means Google is likely making a flagship device this time around. Users have been clamoring for a proper follow-up to the original Pixelbook for quite some time now, so this move would make massive amounts of sense for Google at this stage.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/the-chrome-cast-episode-69-interview-john-maletis-chrome-os-head-ux/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">With Chromebook adoption through the roof in 2020</a> and the platform growing in every possible way, <strong>the Pixelbook 2 could be Google’s first truly breakout Chromebook made and designed by them. </strong> The Chromebook Pixels (2013 &amp; 2015), the Pixelbook and the Pixel Slate were too costly at a time when broader Chromebook adoption wasn’t anything like what it is now. A well-made, high-spec, Google-y Chromebook launched before the end of the year could finally deliver the mass-appeal Chromebook from Google we’ve all been waiting for. Now that we know ‘Halvor’ may be that Chromebook, we’ll be keeping a keen eye out for any further clues we can find.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://chrmshop.com/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"BuyButton\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Shop Best Chromebooks of 2020 So Far on Chrome Shop</a></p> \n<div class=\"newsletterSignupBlock\">\n  Get Alerted About New Posts On \n <br class=\"forMobileOnly\"><span class=\"highlighter\">Your Schedule</span><br> <a class=\"BuyButton\" href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/newsletter-sign-up/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sign Up For The Official Chrome Unboxed Newsletter</a> \n   <div class=\"divider\"></div> <h6>Latest Posts</h6> \n   <div class=\"wp-rss-template-container\" data-wpra-template=\"default\" data-template-ctx=\"eyJmZWVkcyI6Im5ld2VzdHBvc3RzIn0=\"> \n    <div class=\"wp-rss-aggregator wpra-list-template  \" data-page=\"1\"> \n     <ul class=\"wpra-item-list rss-aggregator \" start=\"1\"> \n      <li class=\"wpra-item feed-item gurss\"> <a href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/usi-stylus-pen-affordable-chromebooks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\">Affordable, stowable USI pens will arrive with the next generation of Chromebooks</a> \n       <div class=\"wprss-feed-meta\"> \n       </div> </li> \n      <li class=\"wpra-item feed-item gurss\"> <a href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/the-rare-occasion-we-actually-recommend-a-refurbished-chromebook/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\">The rare occasion we actually recommend a refurbished Chromebook</a> \n       <div class=\"wprss-feed-meta\"> \n       </div> </li> \n      <li class=\"wpra-item feed-item gurss\"> <a href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/the-chrome-cast-77-an-exclusive-interview-with-usi-chairman-peter-mueller/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\">The Chrome Cast 77: An exclusive interview with USI Chairman Peter Mueller</a> \n       <div class=\"wprss-feed-meta\"> \n       </div> </li> \n      <li class=\"wpra-item feed-item gurss\"> <a href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/new-chromebooks-development-volteer-zork-kukui-dedede\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\">Time to add a ton of Chromebooks to the list of upcoming devices</a> \n       <div class=\"wprss-feed-meta\"> \n       </div> </li> \n     </ul> \n    </div> \n   </div> </br></br>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 28 Aug 2020 03:20:00 +0000","feedId":13345,"bgimg":"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/PixelbookSlateFeature-1024x682.jpg","linkMd5":"4fad1284a1f27d9fd30b252f1ea460dd","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn49@2020_6/2020/09/05/08-50-11-384_29ee8e1d111753e3.webp","destWidth":1024,"destHeight":682,"sourceBytes":27625,"destBytes":6322,"author":"Robby Payne","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/PixelbookSlateFeature-1024x682.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn49@2020_6/2020/09/05/08-50-11-384_29ee8e1d111753e3.webp","https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/NewWaveChromebooksEarly2020-150x150.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn84@2020_6/2020/09/05/08-50-14-428_b0b31d3ad829269e.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599295810956},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:10","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:10","title":"Developers working on a “Diagnostics App” for Chrome OS","link":"https://chromeunboxed.com/?p=24950","description":"<a href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/developers-working-on-a-diagnostics-app-for-chrome-os/\" title=\"Developers working on a &#8220;Diagnostics App&#8221;

As it sits, getting support for your device boils down to one of two worthwhile methods. The first method is to head over to the <a href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/news/googles-chromebook-help-forum-gets-a-fresh-look/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"6543\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">official Chromebook Support Foru</a>m to see if the community of well-versed volunteers can assist you with your particular Chrome OS issue. The alternative is to use the in-built Chrome OS feedback option. You can use this method by pressing Alt+Shift+i on your keyboard and describing, in detail, the problem you&#8217;re having with your device. When you send your feedback, it will travel to developers with any necessary system information, diagnostics and screenshots, if you include them. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem with submitting feedback is that you aren&#8217;t going receive any direct assistance with your problem. The feedback option is geared specifically for giving developers information needed to address and fix bugs in the Chrome OS software. So, don&#8217;t expect an email back if you&#8217;re simply trying to figure out why you Chromebook won&#8217;t find your new printer you just set up. That&#8217;s not what feedback is for. For those kind of issues, you&#8217;ll need to refer to the aforementioned support forum or perhaps a site like ours. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"crp_related crp_related_block  \"><h5>more from Chrome Unboxed</h5><ul><li><a href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/5-keyboard-shortcuts-to-chromebook-like-a-pro/\"    target=\"_blank\"  class=\"post-19087\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  width=\"150\" height=\"150\"  src=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/dellchromeoskeyboard-150x150.jpg\" class=\"crp_thumb crp_featured\" alt=\"5 keyboard shortcuts to Chromebook like a pro\" title=\"5 keyboard shortcuts to Chromebook like a pro\" /><span class=\"crp_title\">5 keyboard shortcuts to Chromebook like a pro</span></a><span class=\"crp_author\">  by <a href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/author/gabe/\">Gabriel Brangers</a></span> </li></ul><div class=\"crp_clear\"></div></div>\n\n\n<p>For many of us that grew up on &#8220;other&#8221; operating systems, we&#8217;re accustomed to a certain level built in diagnostics to aide and assist in pinpointing technical issues. Chrome OS has a &#8220;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/chromebook-task-manager-ctrlaltdel-sort-of/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"2393\" target=\"_blank\">task manager</a>&#8221; but apart from being able to identify and terminate processes, it does little else. A new commit in the Chromium repository is looking to change that fact. The feature flag hit my device today after an update to Chrome OS 87 in the Canary channel and is listed simply as &#8220;Diagnostic App.&#8221; <strong>So, what does it do?</strong> For now, nothing. It is, as the commit states, a skeleton framework for the system web app that will come along in a future update. However, the description of the Diagnostic App gives us a good idea of what it will do. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Enables the Diagnostics app that allows Chrome OS users to be able to <br>view their system telemetric information and run diagnostic tests for <br>their device.</p><cite><a href=\"https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/2368102/4/chrome/browser/flag_descriptions.cc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Diagnostic App description</a></cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike the Chrome OS task manager, the Diagnostic App will allow users to view system information as well as run specific diagnostic tests that have yet to be identified. There is mention of battery health in one of the commits. There could very well be a test to replace the little-known battery test that lives inside the crosh terminal that outputs battery health as a percentage along with discharge rate and current battery level. A system web application for device diagnostics would be a much more user-friendly and visible way to get these sort of tools in the hands of general consumers. I would presume that this new app will also give users device-specific information that is currently difficult to find in the front-facing UI of Chrome OS. It would be great if the Diagnostic App shows real-time resource usage and system temperatures like the third-party Chrome app Cog. For now, we can only speculate as to what all the Diagnostic App will do but you can bet I&#8217;ll be checking with every update to the Canary channel. </p>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"zergnet-widget-85739\"></div>\n\n<script language=\"javascript\" type=\"text/javascript\">\n    (function() {\n        var zergnet = document.createElement('script');\n        zergnet.type = 'text/javascript';

This means it will posses the same Snapdragon 7c chip and, from the looks of one of only 3 commits available for this device, <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromiumos/platform/ec/+/2385020\" target=\"_blank\">it will likely be a convertible and have a backlit keyboard.</a></p>\n\n\n<div class=\"crp_related crp_related_block  \"><h5>more from Chrome Unboxed</h5><ul><li><a href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-7c-chromebook/\"    target=\"_blank\"  class=\"post-13421\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  width=\"150\" height=\"150\"  src=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/qualcommChromebookBubs-150x150.jpg\" class=\"crp_thumb crp_featured\" alt=\"Why we feel confident a Qualcomm Snapdragon 7c Chromebook is in development\" title=\"Why we feel confident a Qualcomm Snapdragon 7c Chromebook is in development\" /><span class=\"crp_title\">Why we feel confident a Qualcomm Snapdragon 7c Chromebook is in development</span></a><span class=\"crp_author\">  by <a href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/author/robbypayne/\">Robby Payne</a></span> </li></ul><div class=\"crp_clear\"></div></div>\n\n\n<p><strong>The truth is, we don&#8217;t know a ton about most of these Qualcomm-powered Chromebooks at the moment.</strong>  What is more important right now is the fact that new boards are being put into play and that signals the fact that more manufacturers are jumping on board to make Chromebooks with Qualcomm silicon inside.  Assuming it will be on par with something like the Qualcomm 765 we&#8217;re seeing in phones like the OnePlus Nord, the upcoming Google Pixel 4a 5G and Pixel 5, <strong>this chip will outperform all the other ARM-based options for Chromebooks currently available.</strong>  <em>It just needs to get here.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the entire Snapdragon-on-Chromebooks effort has been going on long enough to warrant a 2020 release, I still don&#8217;t feel like that is in the cards at this point.  We&#8217;re unsure what is taking so long, but my hope is an announcement of some sort happens sooner than later.  Just like with the aging &#8216;Cheza&#8217; board and its now 2-year-old 845 chip, these Chromebooks need to get released before they become obsolete.  If delays keep pushing these devices back, they&#8217;ll feel out of date by the time they actually arrive, and that&#8217;s never a good look.  Perhaps an announcement at Qualcomm&#8217;s yearly summit in December will bring Chromebooks into the fold in an official capacity and we&#8217;ll see something &#8211; virtually &#8211; from CES 2021.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/patreonInContentDesktop.jpg\" class=\"patreonDesktop\">\n\n\n\n<div class=\"newsletterSignupBlock\">\n\tGet Alerted About New Posts On <br class=\"forMobileOnly\"><span class=\"highlighter\">Your Schedule</span><br>\n\t<a class=\"BuyButton\" href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/newsletter-sign-up/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sign Up For The Official Chrome Unboxed Newsletter</a>\n<div class=\"divider\"></div>\n<h6>Latest Posts</h6>\n<div class=\"wp-rss-template-container\" data-wpra-template=\"default\" data-template-ctx=\"eyJmZWVkcyI6Im5ld2VzdHBvc3RzIn0=\">\n    <div class=\"wp-rss-aggregator wpra-list-template  \" data-page=\"1\">\n    \n    \n<ul class=\"wpra-item-list rss-aggregator \"\n    start=\"1\">\n                        <li class=\"wpra-item feed-item gurss\">\n            \n            \n\n    <a  href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/usi-stylus-pen-affordable-chromebooks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\">Affordable, stowable USI pens will arrive with the next generation of Chromebooks</a>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wprss-feed-meta\">\n    \n    \n    </div>\n\n            \n        </li>\n                    <li class=\"wpra-item feed-item gurss\">\n            \n            \n\n    <a  href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/the-rare-occasion-we-actually-recommend-a-refurbished-chromebook/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\">The rare occasion we actually recommend a refurbished Chromebook</a>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wprss-feed-meta\">\n    \n    \n    </div>\n\n            \n        </li>\n                    <li class=\"wpra-item feed-item gurss\">\n            \n            \n\n    <a  href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/the-chrome-cast-77-an-exclusive-interview-with-usi-chairman-peter-mueller/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\">The Chrome Cast 77: An exclusive interview with USI Chairman Peter Mueller</a>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wprss-feed-meta\">\n    \n    \n    </div>\n\n            \n        </li>\n                    <li class=\"wpra-item feed-item gurss\">\n            \n            \n\n    <a  href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/new-chromebooks-development-volteer-zork-kukui-dedede\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\">Time to add a ton of Chromebooks to the list of upcoming devices</a>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wprss-feed-meta\">\n    \n    \n    </div>\n\n            \n        </li>\n        </ul>\n\n        \n</div>\n\n</div>\n\n</div>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Sep 2020 13:38:07 +0000","feedId":13345,"bgimg":"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/snapdragonChromebooksTrogdor-1024x589.jpg","linkMd5":"c7702e5629164bfec2eee23607a76ca7","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn82@2020_6/2020/09/05/08-50-11-620_5e11987e28aca9ca.webp","destWidth":1024,"destHeight":589,"sourceBytes":30442,"destBytes":17806,"author":"Robby Payne","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/snapdragonChromebooksTrogdor-1024x589.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn82@2020_6/2020/09/05/08-50-11-620_5e11987e28aca9ca.webp","https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/qualcommChromebookBubs-150x150.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn28@2020_4/2020/09/05/08-50-15-733_eeacdab9075b4587.webp","https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/patreonInContentDesktop.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn34@2020_5/2020/09/05/08-50-16-094_3e3fd54965f36783.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599295810955},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:10","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:10","title":"Where to find Student Discounts for back to school tech","link":"https://chromeunboxed.com/?p=24894","description":"<a href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/where-to-find-student-discounts-for-back-to-school-tech/\" title=\"Where to find Student Discounts for back to school tech\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"685\" src=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/student-tech-discounts-1024x685.jpg\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"display: block;

While shopping for a Chromebook is a massive undertaking thanks to high demand and short supply, there are still devices to be found and you can save some cash if you shop retailers that offer student and education discounts. This can be a big money saver if you&#8217;re in the market for supplies, PC accessories and gear to get you or your student on their way back to the classroom. We&#8217;ve rounded up some retailers that offer student and teacher discounts when you verify your affiliation with a qualifying EDU institution. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Best Buy</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Best Buy&#8217;s student deals program is very well-known and easy to apply for if you have a student email. With the program, students have access to exclusive savings on a wide variety of products including Chromebooks, gear and accessories. The Student Deals page updates frequently and you can score savings year round. The best part? You can use your current Best Buy account and get verified for Student Deals with your EDU email address. Sign up for Best Buy Student Deals at the link below. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://fave.co/2y76Qva\" class=\"BuyButton\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy Student Deals</a></p>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Samsung</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I wasn&#8217;t aware, until recently, that Samsung had a discount program but they do and the savings are huge if you&#8217;re a teacher, student, first responders, military and more. Qualifying shoppers can grab as much as 30% off when you shop on Samsung.com. With the current sale on the Galaxy Chromebook, a student discount would save you an extra $119.85 when you buy the ultra-premium 10th Gen Intel convertible and that&#8217;s on top of the $200 that Samsung already took off of the MSRP. The 30% savings applies to most products from Samsung and shoppers can also add an additional 10% discount to many sale items. Check out the program below. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://fave.co/2E4veUc\" class=\"BuyButton\" target=\"_blank\">Samsung Discount Program</a></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"crp_related crp_related_block  \"><h5>more from Chrome Unboxed</h5><ul><li><a href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/chromebooks-hard-to-find-where-to-buy-deals/\"    target=\"_blank\"  class=\"post-17098\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  width=\"150\" height=\"150\"  src=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/nochromebooks-150x150.jpg\" class=\"crp_thumb crp_featured\" alt=\"[Update] It&#039;s not you, Chromebooks are getting hard to find\" title=\"[Update] It&#039;s not you, Chromebooks are getting hard to find\" /><span class=\"crp_title\">[Update] It&#8217;s not you, Chromebooks are getting hard to find</span></a><span class=\"crp_author\">  by <a href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/author/gabe/\">Gabriel Brangers</a></span> </li></ul><div class=\"crp_clear\"></div></div>\n\n\n<h2>Lenovo</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Lenovo could honestly be your one-stop-shop for everything tech and gear-related if you wanted to get all your shopping done in one fell swoop.

Students and teachers can sign up and complete a quick verification via ID.me and BOOM, instantly get a site-wide 8% discount on anything and everything Lenovo offers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;ll find a lot more than just PCs on Lenovo&#8217;s site. The offer Assistant-enabled smart displays, backpacks, PC accessories and you can even grab cool tech like a new <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://fave.co/3lvepDs\" target=\"_blank\">FitBit</a> or an <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://fave.co/32quAZX\" target=\"_blank\">Xbox One</a>. On top of the student discounts, you can get cash back every day on Lenovo.com when you <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.rakuten.com/r/GBRANG2?utm_campaign=RAF&#38;utm_medium=RAF%20share&#38;eeid=45830\" target=\"_blank\">shop with Rakuten</a>.

Kid Space by Google offers an integrated hub where kids can explore and discover new content to help them learn and create. We&#8217;ll cover more on that later. The more-relevant announcement from Lenovo was the addition of a new Google Assistant speaker to the company&#8217;s growing line of smart-home devices. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As some of you may know, Lenovo&#8217;s current Smart Clock with the Google Assistant is my favorite smart display with their 7&#8243; full-featured model coming in as a close second. The 4&#8243; bedside clock is the perfect marriage of alarm clock and smart display. You don&#8217;t get video playback or a camera but I don&#8217;t want those features on my nightstand so it&#8217;s perfect. The latest addition hones down the nightstand experience to an even smaller device called the Lenovo Smart Clock Essential.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Lenovo is once again

Clock Essential features the same 1.5&#8243; 3W speaker found in the larger clock from Lenovo which means it should be a decent-sounding device. I&#8217;d put my current one up against the Nest Mini any day of the week. Like its larger sibling, the Essential Smart Clock features a USB port on the back for charging your phone or whatever other accessory you have sitting around. I use it to charge my <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/ticwatch-pro-lte-review-the-wearos-smartwatch-for-the-masses-video/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"14708\" target=\"_blank\">Tic Watch Pro</a> and it works perfectly. The smaller display foregoes a touchscreen and instead, offers a true alarm clock style interface. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like the 4&#8243; Smart Clock, the Essential features soft touch volume buttons on the top of the fabric-encased chassis but this model adds a dedicated alarm button and a play/pause button. Lenovo has also added a &#8220;night light&#8221; to this model to help you navigate your bedroom when you have to get up in the middle of the night. I&#8217;m not sure if this will simply be a sensor-activated brightening of the display or if it actually has an in-built light. You&#8217;ll also get a button on the back for muting the microphone which should be standard on any smart speaker. Like any Assistant speaker, you&#8217;ll be able to control all of your connected things from the Essential and it even has a weather widget on the display so you can keep an eye on the temperature. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Lenovo Smart Clock Essential goes on sale next month and will retail for $49.99. That means we&#8217;ll likely see some really great prices come the holiday shopping season. In the mean time, the larger Smart Clock happens to be on sale at Best Buy right now for the same $49.99. While I definitely see the appeal of this smaller, more discrete model, $50 for the current Smart Clock is a solid deal and still my recommendation. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://fave.co/30mnUtm\" class=\"BuyButton\" target=\"_blank\">4&#8243;

Full Linux distros have various tools available to run backups and store them locally or off site depending on your personal preference. Chrome OS, however, has a built in tool for this task and you can keep you backup right on you Chromebook or better yet, put it on Google Drive so it&#8217;s safe. This is very handy if you run into a situation where you need to<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/chromebook-chrome-os-factory-reset-how-to-powerwash/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"19234\" target=\"_blank\"> power wash your device or heaven forbid have a system crash that requires a full recovery. </a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>To get started, it&#8217;s a good idea to make sure your Linux container is up to date. You can do this by opening your Linux terminal and pasting the following command. Press enter and wait for any upgrades to complete. Once that&#8217;s finished, head over to your Chrome OS settings by clicking the gear icon in the system tray at the bottom right of the display. (It&#8217;s where the clock lives.)</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>sudo apt update &#38;&#38; sudo apt upgrade -y</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<h2>Backup</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the settings, you should see Linux (Beta) in the left-hand menu. Click that and click the arrow on the right side of the Linux tab. This will open the Linux menu where you should see a tab that says &#8220;Backup &#38; restore.&#8221; Click that tab. We&#8217;re going to run a backup so click that option. When the file picker opens, you can set a custom filename for your backup and save it in the Files folder but I recommend selecting My Drive. This will save the backup to you Google Drive and you&#8217;ll be able to access it anywhere on any device. Once you&#8217;ve chosen your folder, click save an you will see the progress of the backup in the notification tray of your Chromebook. Now you have a full backup of all your Linux apps and associated data. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Restore</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To restore a previous backup, we will return to the Linux settings menu and select &#8220;restore&#8221; instead of backup. Once the file picker opens, navigate to the folder with the backup you wish to use and select it. Click &#8220;open&#8221; to initiate the restore but keep in mind, this will delete any apps or data you have in your current Linux container. You will once again see a progress bar in the notification tray and when it is finished, your previously backed up Linux setup will be ready to use on your device. Simply open the Linux terminal and type a command to open a package or head to the app launcher to find apps that you have installed. That&#8217;s it for today. Stay tuned for more tips from The Command Line. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"newsletterSignupBlock\">\n\tGet Alerted About New Posts On <br class=\"forMobileOnly\"><span class=\"highlighter\">Your Schedule</span><br>\n\t<a class=\"BuyButton\" href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/newsletter-sign-up/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sign Up For The Official Chrome Unboxed Newsletter</a>\n<div class=\"divider\"></div>\n<h6>Latest Posts</h6>\n<div class=\"wp-rss-template-container\" data-wpra-template=\"default\" data-template-ctx=\"eyJmZWVkcyI6Im5ld2VzdHBvc3RzIn0=\">\n    <div class=\"wp-rss-aggregator wpra-list-template  \" data-page=\"1\">\n    \n    \n<ul class=\"wpra-item-list rss-aggregator \"\n    start=\"1\">\n                        <li class=\"wpra-item feed-item gurss\">\n            \n            \n\n    <a  href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/usi-stylus-pen-affordable-chromebooks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\">Affordable, stowable USI pens will arrive with the next generation of Chromebooks</a>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wprss-feed-meta\">\n    \n    \n    </div>\n\n            \n        </li>\n                    <li class=\"wpra-item feed-item gurss\">\n            \n            \n\n    <a  href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/the-rare-occasion-we-actually-recommend-a-refurbished-chromebook/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\">The rare occasion we actually recommend a refurbished Chromebook</a>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wprss-feed-meta\">\n    \n    \n    </div>\n\n            \n        </li>\n                    <li class=\"wpra-item feed-item gurss\">\n            \n            \n\n    <a  href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/the-chrome-cast-77-an-exclusive-interview-with-usi-chairman-peter-mueller/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\">The Chrome Cast 77: An exclusive interview with USI Chairman Peter Mueller</a>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wprss-feed-meta\">\n    \n    \n    </div>\n\n            \n        </li>\n                    <li class=\"wpra-item feed-item gurss\">\n            \n            \n\n    <a  href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/new-chromebooks-development-volteer-zork-kukui-dedede\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\">Time to add a ton of Chromebooks to the list of upcoming devices</a>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wprss-feed-meta\">\n    \n    \n    </div>\n\n            \n        </li>\n        </ul>\n\n        \n</div>\n\n</div>\n\n</div>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 30 Aug 2020 13:36:36 +0000","feedId":13345,"bgimg":"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/linux-backup-restore-chromebook-1024x576.jpg","linkMd5":"59b13e95332af5a8bbaf7877256ae306","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn1@2020_2/2020/09/05/08-50-11-389_9058ade9aad26cda.webp","destWidth":1024,"destHeight":576,"sourceBytes":27530,"destBytes":16586,"author":"Gabriel Brangers","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/linux-backup-restore-chromebook-1024x576.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn1@2020_2/2020/09/05/08-50-11-389_9058ade9aad26cda.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599295810955},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:10","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:10","title":"The rare occasion we actually recommend a refurbished Chromebook","link":"https://chromeunboxed.com/?p=25302","description":"<a href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/the-rare-occasion-we-actually-recommend-a-refurbished-chromebook/\" title=\"The rare occasion we actually recommend a refurbished Chromebook\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/AcerChromebook715Review-1024x576.jpg\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"display: block;

That said, there are always exceptions to the rule. If a device makes sense monetarily speaking and you can add a little peace of mind with a warranty, refurbished can sometimes be the best choice. This happens to be one of those deals. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Outside of the Pixel Slate, the Acer Chromebook 715 was one of the first models to hit the market with a built-in fingerprint sensor. The 15.6&#8243; aluminum Chromebook is powered by 8th Gen Intel processors and features an integrated numeric keypad. Woot! is currently offering refurbished Core i3 or Core i5 versions of the Chromebook 715 at a price that&#8217;s significantly lower than a new model. Again, we shy away from renewed devices but in today&#8217;s market, we&#8217;re on the lookout for any and all Chromebooks that are worth buying. It&#8217;s very difficult to find premium devices at all let alone at a decent price. The Acer Chromebook 715 offers a ton of great features and picking up a refurbished model can save you a couple of hundred dollars. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Hands-On With the New Acer Chromebook 714 &#38; 715\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lYu4BoF7js8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re worried about warranty, Woot! has you covered. You can grab the Core i3 Acer with 8GB of RAM and 64GB of storage for $439.99 and tack on a 1-year protection plan for only $79.99. That nabs you a powerful 15.6&#8243; FullHD Chromebook with a lot of bells and whistles for just under $520 and that&#8217;s a tough deal to beat in the current climate. If you want more horsepower, you can pick up the Core i5 with a whopping 16GB of RAM for $669.99. Woot! usually runs these deals until they&#8217;ve sold out but the last time this model was on offer, it was gone in less than 24 hours.

In Chrome OS 85, however, those flags necessary to make these higher refresh rates happen are in the past and the new normal sees users able to connect up their external monitors that support higher refresh rates and fully take advantage of them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just today, we hooked up a Chromebook to a monitor in the office and realized that it actually supports more than 60hz and actually has the ability to leverage 75hz.  To be honest, we didn&#8217;t even know this particular monitor had that ability at all, but Chrome OS&#8217; new display settings make finding and changing the refresh rates on your connected monitors a snap.  <strong>Here&#8217;s how to make the changes and see if your monitor is capable of smoother refresh rates.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img data-attachment-id=\"25235\" data-permalink=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/chrome-os-85-refresh-rates-selector-smooth-external-display/chromeos85settingsdisplay/\" data-orig-file=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ChromeOS85SettingsDisplay.png\" data-orig-size=\"970,1071\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&#34;aperture&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;credit&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;camera&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;caption&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;created_timestamp&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;copyright&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;focal_length&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;iso&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;shutter_speed&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;title&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;orientation&#34;:&#34;0&#34;}\" data-image-title=\"ChromeOS85SettingsDisplay\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ChromeOS85SettingsDisplay-272x300.png\" data-large-file=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ChromeOS85SettingsDisplay-927x1024.png\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ChromeOS85SettingsDisplay-927x1024.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-25235\" width=\"493\" height=\"543\" srcset=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ChromeOS85SettingsDisplay-272x300.png 272w, https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ChromeOS85SettingsDisplay-768x848.png 768w, https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ChromeOS85SettingsDisplay.png 970w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 493px) 100vw, 493px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Navigate to your settings and head to <strong>Device &#62; Displays &#62; Select your display &#62; Refresh Rate</strong> and you&#8217;ll now have the option to choose all the possible refresh rates that your monitor supports.  Sadly, my daily driver display &#8211; an LG ultrawide 3440&#215;1440 &#8211; doesn&#8217;t support anything higher than 60hz.  After seeing Chrome OS running at 75hz on Gabriel&#8217;s monitor, I have to admit I&#8217;m already considering an upgrade.  There&#8217;s something about that fluid, buttery motion on higher refresh screens that <strong><em>looks so awesome.</em></strong>  If you&#8217;ve never seen it in action, you may want to go and hit up your settings to see if your connected display has the ability to push a better refresh rate.  <strong>Trust me, if it does, your eyes will thank you.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/patreonInContentDesktop.jpg\" class=\"patreonDesktop\">\n\n\n\n<div class=\"newsletterSignupBlock\">\n\tGet Alerted About New Posts On <br class=\"forMobileOnly\"><span class=\"highlighter\">Your Schedule</span><br>\n\t<a class=\"BuyButton\" href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/newsletter-sign-up/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sign Up For The Official Chrome Unboxed Newsletter</a>\n<div class=\"divider\"></div>\n<h6>Latest Posts</h6>\n<div class=\"wp-rss-template-container\" data-wpra-template=\"default\" data-template-ctx=\"eyJmZWVkcyI6Im5ld2VzdHBvc3RzIn0=\">\n    <div class=\"wp-rss-aggregator wpra-list-template  \" data-page=\"1\">\n    \n    \n<ul class=\"wpra-item-list rss-aggregator \"\n    start=\"1\">\n                        <li class=\"wpra-item feed-item gurss\">\n            \n            \n\n    <a  href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/usi-stylus-pen-affordable-chromebooks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\">Affordable, stowable USI pens will arrive with the next generation of Chromebooks</a>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wprss-feed-meta\">\n    \n    \n    </div>\n\n            \n        </li>\n                    <li class=\"wpra-item feed-item gurss\">\n            \n            \n\n    <a  href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/the-rare-occasion-we-actually-recommend-a-refurbished-chromebook/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\">The rare occasion we actually recommend a refurbished Chromebook</a>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wprss-feed-meta\">\n    \n    \n    </div>\n\n            \n        </li>\n                    <li class=\"wpra-item feed-item gurss\">\n            \n            \n\n    <a  href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/the-chrome-cast-77-an-exclusive-interview-with-usi-chairman-peter-mueller/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\">The Chrome Cast 77: An exclusive interview with USI Chairman Peter Mueller</a>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wprss-feed-meta\">\n    \n    \n    </div>\n\n            \n        </li>\n                    <li class=\"wpra-item feed-item gurss\">\n            \n            \n\n    <a  href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/new-chromebooks-development-volteer-zork-kukui-dedede\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\">Time to add a ton of Chromebooks to the list of upcoming devices</a>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wprss-feed-meta\">\n    \n    \n    </div>\n\n            \n        </li>\n        </ul>\n\n        \n</div>\n\n</div>\n\n</div>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Sep 2020 18:50:21 +0000","feedId":13345,"bgimg":"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/chromeOS85externalDisplayRefreshRate-1024x576.jpg","linkMd5":"2b41ee3eb1e098f01049b421c4510e63","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn25@2020_6/2020/09/05/08-50-11-432_f842974c2982b134.webp","destWidth":1024,"destHeight":576,"sourceBytes":101164,"destBytes":68424,"author":"Robby Payne","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/chromeOS85externalDisplayRefreshRate-1024x576.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn25@2020_6/2020/09/05/08-50-11-432_f842974c2982b134.webp","https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ChromeOS85SettingsDisplay-927x1024.png":null,"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/patreonInContentDesktop.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn34@2020_5/2020/09/05/08-50-16-094_3e3fd54965f36783.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599295810954},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:10","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:10","title":"3 ways to install Linux packages on your Chromebook","link":"https://chromeunboxed.com/?p=24997","description":"<a href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/3-ways-to-install-linux-packages-on-your-chromebook/\" title=\"3 ways to install Linux packages on your Chromebook\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/install-deb-package-how-to-1024x576.jpg\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"display: block;

You&#8217;ve probably spent precious time searching the web to figure out which Linux apps are available via your shiny, new Linux terminal. Speaking of the terminal, it&#8217;s completely understandable if you&#8217;ve slammed your Chromebook shut after a few hours of trying to grasp the Linux lingo and how to use the command line interface. Well, that&#8217;s why we&#8217;re here. The Command Line series was created to explore Linux on Chrome OS and help you make the most out of your device. We aim to demystify the newly found operating system inside your operating system. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, we&#8217;re going to take a look a three different methods for installing applications, or packages in the Linux container on Chrome OS. If you&#8217;ve downloaded a .deb file from a trusted source, most often you can simply double-click the file and the Linux installer will take over and install the package for you. However, learning your way around the terminal and the various methods by which you can install Linux packages can be very useful for a number of reasons. First, many of the packages regularly used in Linux are available directly from the Debian 10 (Buster) repository and you can download and install them from the terminal with a single command. Second and equally as useful, some command line tools will handle installing dependencies that don&#8217;t come along for the ride when you install a Linux package. Later, we&#8217;ll explore various package managers and building apps from the source. For now, let&#8217;s just look at these three terminal commands. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"crp_related crp_related_block  \"><h5>more from Chrome Unboxed</h5><ul><li><a href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/the-command-line-getting-started-with-linux-apps-on-your-chromebook/\"    target=\"_blank\"  class=\"post-15431\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  width=\"150\" height=\"150\"  src=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/AdaptaLinuxChromebook-150x150.png\" class=\"crp_thumb crp_featured\" alt=\"The Command Line: Getting started with Linux apps on your Chromebook\" title=\"The Command Line: Getting started with Linux apps on your Chromebook\" srcset=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/AdaptaLinuxChromebook-150x150.png 150w, https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/AdaptaLinuxChromebook-350x350.png 350w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" /><span class=\"crp_title\">The Command Line: Getting started with Linux apps on your Chromebook</span></a><span class=\"crp_author\">  by <a href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/author/gabe/\">Gabriel Brangers</a></span> </li></ul><div class=\"crp_clear\"></div></div>\n\n\n<h2>dpkg</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><code>dpkg</code> (Debian Package) is the base package management system that is built into the Debian operating system. If you have a locally saved .deb package, you  can use <code>dpkg</code> to install it. <code>dpkg</code> has some other functions but we&#8217;ll cover those in another article. To install a .deb package with <code>dpkg</code>, open up your Linux terminal to get started. The basic installation command is <code>dpkg -i some.deb</code>. and you will replace the some.deb with the exact file name that you are installing. This only works for local files and you will need to specify the path to the file. If you move your .deb package to the Linux folder in the Chrome OS files app, you don&#8217;t have to edit the command in any way. While dpkg is a sure-fire way to install locally stored packages, it&#8217;s not the go-to method for most Linux users. The more common tool for installation is <strong>APT</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>APT</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>APT</strong> is exactly what it stands for, Advanced Package Tool. It is a tool that builds on the <code>dpkg</code> package management system. Unlike <code>dpkg</code>, <strong>APT</strong> has the ability to fetch .deb packages from whatever repositories are present in your Linux OS. For Chromebooks, the repo is Buster Main and Google&#8217;s in-house repository specifically for Chrome OS. When you use <strong>APT</strong>, your requested packaged will be downloaded and installed in once action. Using APT in the Chrome OS Linux terminal also requires super user permissions. Therefore, it is used with the <code>sudo</code> command. For this example, we&#8217;ll install a random game I found called Blob and Conquer. You would install this package using APT with the following command. Once installed, you can launch the app by typing the package name in the terminal and hitting enter or finding the app icon in your app launcher.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>sudo apt install blobandconquer</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>To install from the repository, you will need to know exactly how the package is named in the repo. To find the full list of packages available in Debian Buster, you can check out the official list <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://packages.debian.org/stable/allpackages\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. <strong>APT</strong> can also install local packages with same command. Instead of the app name, you would use the filename just like we did with <code>dpkg</code>. If you have a .deb file in you Linux folder, simply use the following command to install it but replace the last part with the actual filename to include the .deb extension. </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>sudo apt install ./some.deb</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<h2>GDebi</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Last but not least, we have GDebi. This tool isn&#8217;t built into the Debian container on Chrome OS but you can install it directly from the repository using the APT command we just discussed. GDebi is another tool that can be used to install locally saved .deb files. That advantage to using GDebi instead of dpkg or APT for local files is that GDepi will ping the repository and pull down any necessary dependencies needed to install the locally saved .dep package. There are a lot of packages that require additional downloads to work properly and this tool will ensure you have all the right pieces to install your application. You can install GDebi with the following command. </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>sudo apt install gdebi</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>GDebi does come with a user interface that can be launched from your Chrome OS app drawer but I have found it to be unreliable on my device. Instead, you can use GDebi from the terminal in combination with the <code>sudo</code> command. Once you have a .deb file downloaded and moved to your Linux folder, you  can install it and any dependencies using GDebi with the following command. Make sure to replace the last portion with the actual filename. </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>sudo gdebi somepackage.deb</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>So, there you go. You&#8217;re now on your way to mastering three more tools in your Linux arsenal. Check back tomorrow when we will cover two very different package managers that can make installing packages a breeze. We&#8217;d love to hear from you. If you&#8217;re exploring Linux apps on Chrome OS, what obstacles have you run into? What tips would help you feel more confident inside the terminal? Drop a comment or shoot us an email and we&#8217;ll get it on the &#8220;how-to&#8221;  list. Stay tuned. There&#8217;s more Command Line headed your way. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"newsletterSignupBlock\">\n\tGet Alerted About New Posts On <br class=\"forMobileOnly\"><span class=\"highlighter\">Your
