Iterative filter methods for prediction signals based on classic inpainting methods are introduced and extensive parameter tests are described. In order to construct an alternative prediction filter for video coding, techniques originally employed for inpainting are applied. Thereby, the structures of the underlying prediction were incorporated into the filter construction making it signal adaptive. The resulting optimization problem is solved using the so-called Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). The undertaken novel parameter tests are described and it is shown that they improve the coding efficiency of the tool. The suggested filter is embedded into a software based on HEVC with additional QTBT (Quadtree plus Binary Tree) and MTT (Multi-Type-Tree) block structure. Overall, the proposed filter method obtains average bitrate savings of 1.35&#x0025; at an average encoder runtime increase of 28&#x0025; and decoder runtime increase of 38&#x0025;. UHD test sequences achieve bitrate savings of up to 3.66&#x0025; for Random Access.","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 01 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":5821,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"1e076d7275adb76e7f8e8a8d227c293e","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","publishedOrCreatedDate":1603818646041}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-10-28 01:10:46","updatedTime":"2020-10-28 01:10:46","feedId":5821,"fetchDate":"Tue, 27 Oct 2020 17:10:46 +0000","fetchMs":690,"handleMs":114,"totalMs":30368,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":646,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"ac7a0c7ef634bc8118941a5bc33d39c6","hostName":"europe64*","requestId":"a6e093acf3b9400c92a3fe3f538f9d93_5821","contentType":"text/xml","totalBytes":0,"bgimgsTotal":0,"bgimgsGithubTotal":0,"articlesImgsTotal":0,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":0,"successGithubMap":{},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 04:30:18","updatedTime":"2020-09-01 11:18:17","id":5821,"name":" IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC ","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/rss/TOC83.XML","subscriber":null,"website":null,"icon":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/favicon.ico","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx61/cdn12@2020_5/2020/09/01/03-18-15-913_645027bc9cf1c116.ico","description":"TOC Alert for Publication# 83 ","weekly":null,"link":null},"noPictureArticleList":[],"tmpCommonImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBodyImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBgImgCdnBytes":0,"extra4":{"start":1603818615676,"total":0,"statList":[{"spend":30253,"msg":"获取xml内容"},{"spend":114,"msg":"解释文章"},{"spend":0,"msg":"上传封面图到cdn"},{"spend":0,"msg":"正文链接上传到cdn"},{"spend":0,"msg":"修正封面图上传失败重新上传"}]},"extra5":0,"extra6":0,"extra7ImgCdnFailResultVector":[],"extra10_invalidATagHrefValue":{},"extra111_proxyServerAndStatMap":{},"extra12ImgCdnSuccessResultVector":[],"successGithubMap":{},"failGithubMap":{}}
