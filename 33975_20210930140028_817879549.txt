This is the third post in a four-part series exploring what the students have achieved during this year’s development stint.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<h2>Episode Three: Ahead of the Curve, On the Cutting Edge</h2> \n<p><br><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://code.blender.org/2021/09/gsoc-roundup-episode-two-editorial-endeavours/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"7361\" target=\"_blank\">While the second post of the series explored the GSoC projects dealing with the VSE and the UV Editors,</a> this third and penultimate post will go through the two projects aiming to improve a fundamental element of any DCC software: Modelling. More specifically, these projects tackle two areas and tools that are at the foundation of many modeling workflows. Dilith Jayakody was at the head of the<strong> Curve Improvements</strong> project, while Cian Jinks was responsible for the <strong>Knife Tool Improvements</strong> project.</br></p> \n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-dots\" /> \n<h2>Curve Improvements</h2> \n<h3>Straight Shooter</h3> \n<p>Under the supervision of project mentors Hans Goudey and Falk David, Dilith Jayakody aimed to improve the manipulation and creation of Blender curves, an area which the student had already contributed to before the beginning of the summer. As per the project proposal, Dilith ended up implementing two major new features at the end of his GSoC tenure:</p> \n<h4>Curve Fillet Node</h4> \n<p>Initially planned to be a regular tool, Dilith opted to implement this feature as a Geometry Nodes node at the recommendation of mentor Hans Goudey, this implementation having the same functionality but benefiting from(and to) the procedural breadth of the system. The goal of this node is to be able to create and control bevel-like rounding of curves at control points. <a href=\"https://wiki.blender.org/wiki/User:Dilithjay/GSoC_2021/Final_Report#Curve_Fillet_Node\">Learn More.</a></p> \n<figure class=\"wp-block-video\">\n <video controls=\"\" poster=\"\" src=\"https://code.blender.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Curve-fillet-demo-vid.mp4\"></video>\n <figcaption>\n   The Curve FIllet node’s different options in action\n </figcaption>\n</figure> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://developer.blender.org/D12115\">Curve Fillet Node patch</a> is ready for you to play with in the <a href=\"https://builder.blender.org/download/daily/\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://builder.blender.org/download/daily/\">latest builds</a> of Blender 3.0 Alpha!</p> \n<h4>Curve Pen Tool</h4> \n<p>The goal of the pen tool is to overhaul the curve editing and creation process, by concentrating old and new curve editing functionality and shortcuts into a single tool. <a href=\"https://wiki.blender.org/wiki/User:Dilithjay/GSoC_2021/Final_Report#Curve_Pen_Tool\">Learn More.</a></p> \n<figure class=\"wp-block-video\">\n <video controls=\"\" src=\"https://code.blender.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Curve-pen-demo-vid.mp4\"></video>\n <figcaption>\n  The Curve Pen tool makes the creation and editing of curves a breeze\n </figcaption>\n</figure> \n<h3>What comes next</h3> \n<p>Aside from working on getting these two patches merged with master, Dilith will be looking at implementing further improvements to the Curve Pen tool, including snapping support, vertex slide, and more.</p> \n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-dots\" /> \n<h2>Knife Tool Improvements </h2> \n<h3>Sharp as a Knife</h3> \n<p>The brainchild of student Cian Jinks, the Knife Improvements project holds the distinction of being fully merged with master, meaning that all the features discussed below are already available in the latest Blender 3.0 <a href=\"https://builder.blender.org/download/daily/\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://builder.blender.org/download/daily/\">daily builds</a>! Under the supervision of mentor Howard Trickey, Cian aimed to implement a plethora of features upgrading the Knife Tool’s usability and power. While the student’s <a href=\"https://wiki.blender.org/wiki/User:HobbesOS/GSOC2021/FinalReport\">final report</a> and <a href=\"https://developer.blender.org/D12600\">patch description</a> hold all the details on the newly implemented features, here is a rundown of some of the standouts:</p> \n<h4 class=\"mt-5 mb-3\">Visible Distance and Angle Measurements</h4> \n<p>Pressing S will enable measurements, and pressing S repeatedly will cycle between the three modes: Only Distance, Only Angles, Both. <a href=\"https://wiki.blender.org/wiki/User:HobbesOS/GSOC2021/FinalReport#Visible_Distance_and_Angle_Measurements\">Learn more.</a></p> \n<figure class=\"wp-block-video\">\n <video controls=\"\" src=\"https://code.blender.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Visible-Distance-and-Angle-Measurements.mp4\"></video>\n <figcaption>\n  Cian’s Knife Tool improvements include the ability to show measurements and angles between cut segments and mesh edges.\n </figcaption>\n</figure> \n<h4 class=\"mt-5 mb-3\">Constrained Angle Mode Improvements</h4> \n<p>Added setting to control increments, ability to enter snapping angle increment via number keys, and a new local constrained angle mode. <a href=\"https://wiki.blender.org/wiki/User:HobbesOS/GSOC2021/FinalReport#Snapping_to_Global_and_Local_Orientation\">Learn more.</a></p> \n<figure class=\"wp-block-video\">\n <video controls=\"\" src=\"https://code.blender.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/snapping-to-local.mp4\"></video>\n <figcaption>\n  The new local constrained angle mode in action\n </figcaption>\n</figure> \n<p></p> \n<h4 class=\"mt-5 mb-3\">Multi-Object Edit Mode</h4> \n<p>The Knife tool can now cut through multiple objects in edit mode. <a href=\"https://devtalk.blender.org/t/gsoc-2021-knife-tool-improvements-weekly-reports/19046/23\">Learn more.</a></p> \n<div id=\"tabs-block_61446b418988c\" class=\"tabs\"> \n <div class=\"\"> \n  <ul class=\"nav nav-tabs\" role=\"tablist\"> \n   <li class=\"nav-item\"> <a class=\"nav-link py-2 active\" id=\"t-multi-object-edit-mode-0-tab\" data-toggle=\"pill\" href=\"https://code.blender.org/?p=7432#t-multi-object-edit-mode-0\" role=\"tab\" aria-controls=\"t-multi-object-edit-mode-0\" aria-selected=\"true\"> Multi-Object Edit Mode </a> </li> \n   <li class=\"nav-item\"> <a class=\"nav-link py-2 \" id=\"t-orientation-snapping-w-multi-object-1-tab\" data-toggle=\"pill\" href=\"https://code.blender.org/?p=7432#t-orientation-snapping-w-multi-object-1\" role=\"tab\" aria-controls=\"t-orientation-snapping-w-multi-object-1\" aria-selected=\"false\"> Orientation Snapping w/ Multi-Object </a> </li> \n   <li class=\"nav-item\"> <a class=\"nav-link py-2 \" id=\"t-complex-meshes-2-tab\" data-toggle=\"pill\" href=\"https://code.blender.org/?p=7432#t-complex-meshes-2\" role=\"tab\" aria-controls=\"t-complex-meshes-2\" aria-selected=\"false\"> Complex Meshes </a> </li> \n  </ul> \n  <div class=\"tab-content text-center\"> \n   <div class=\"tab-pane show active\" id=\"t-multi-object-edit-mode-0\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"t-multi-object-edit-mode-0-tab\"> \n    <img src=\"https://code.blender.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/94bfeb0ecfd4b5537796e920dbfd11dbfe59d01b.gif?x94539\" class=\"img-fluid rounded\"> </img>\n   </div> \n   <div class=\"tab-pane \" id=\"t-orientation-snapping-w-multi-object-1\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"t-orientation-snapping-w-multi-object-1-tab\"> \n    <img src=\"https://code.blender.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/fec5a6b20dffc404b4611834972dcbca90d78df0.gif?x94539\" class=\"img-fluid rounded\"> \n     <div class=\"py-3 px-5 mx-5 lead\">\n      Takes the local orientation of the object the cut segment was started on.\n     </div> </img>\n   </div> \n   <div class=\"tab-pane \" id=\"t-complex-meshes-2\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"t-complex-meshes-2-tab\"> \n    <img src=\"https://code.blender.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/a7970821f16bb339c898aa45e7d9f5b8d336cec7.gif?x94539\" class=\"img-fluid rounded\"> </img>\n   </div> \n  </div> \n </div> \n <style type=\"text/css\"> #tabs-block_61446b418988c { color: ; } #tabs-block_61446b418988c .embed-responsive-item, #tabs-block_61446b418988c img { background: ; } </style> \n</div> \n<p></p> \n<h4>Undo Improvements</h4> \n<p>Pressing Ctrl-Z undoes the previous cut segment and re-adjusts starting point for the current cut segment. <a href=\"https://wiki.blender.org/wiki/User:HobbesOS/GSOC2021/FinalReport#Undo_Capability\">Learn More.</a></p> \n<figure class=\"wp-block-video\">\n <video controls=\"\" src=\"https://code.blender.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Undo-Improvements.mp4\"></video>\n <figcaption>\n  The knife tool now supports expected undo behavior.\n </figcaption>\n</figure> \n<h4>Snapping to Global and Local Orientation</h4> \n<p>Press X, Y, Z, to constraint to an axis.
