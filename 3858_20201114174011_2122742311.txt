Our passion is to make it completely open and free for everyone.\n\nToday we are proud to introduce the latest evolution of the Babylon Platform, the amazingly simple <strong>Babylon.js 4.2.</strong>\n\nhttps://youtu.be/vkLZMHYj8d4\n\nWe are artists, developers, creators, and dreamers and we want to make it as simple as possible to enable everyone to bring their ideas to life. With this new version of Babylon.js, we set out to make it even easier to develop with. From a ton of new tools, to improved workflows and features, new documentation and more, it is our sincere hope that <strong>Babylon.js 4.2</strong> will make your development process faster and easier while unlocking new simple ways to work.\n\nBefore diving into more detail, we want to take a quick moment to humbly thank the incredible community that contribute their knowledge, expertise, help, and passion to this amazing platform. Babylon.js would not be here without you.\n<h3>Powerful New Particle Editor</h3>\nYou may already know that Babylon.js features a rich particle system with seemingly endless properties and features that you can leverage to create the perfect particle effect. Well, today it gets a whole lot easier. Welcome to the brand new Babylon.js Particle Editor. Built directly inside of the Inspector, you can now create particle systems with the click of the mouse. With direct UI access to nearly every particle system property, you can edit and shape the perfect particle system without writing a single line of code! And of course, you can export your particle system or save it to the snippet server to load into your Babylon.js scene with one simple line of code. Creating incredible particles has NEVER been more simple.\n\nSee it in action here: <a href=\"https://aka.ms/4_2_particlePlayground\">Play with the Particle Editor</a>\n\nLearn more: <a href=\"https://aka.ms/4_2_particleDoc\">Particle Editor Documentation</a>\n<h4><img class=\"size-full wp-image-56061 aligncenter\" src=\"https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2020/11/1_bOFaMCZWXDd0o_FvdfEPMA.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" /></h4>\n<h3>Quick and Easy Sprite Editor</h3>\nCreating, controlling, and managing sprite systems has also just gotten a whole lot easier with the brand new Sprite Editor. Also built directly into the Inspector, the Sprite Editor allows you to create, control, and save sprite systems without writing a single line of code.
