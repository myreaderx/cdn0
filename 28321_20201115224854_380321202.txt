In the kinematical coarse-graining, the snapshots are clustered into a few centroids representing the whole ensemble. The dynamics is conceptualized as a directed network, where the centroids represent nodes and the directed edges denote possible finite-time transitions. The transition probabilities and times are inferred from the snapshot data. The resulting cluster-based network model constitutes a deterministic–stochastic grey-box model resolving the coherent-structure evolution. This model is motivated by limit-cycle dynamics, illustrated for the chaotic Lorenz attractor and successfully demonstrated for the laminar two-dimensional mixing layer featuring Kelvin–Helmholtz vortices and vortex pairing, and for an actuated turbulent boundary layer with complex dynamics. Cluster-based network modelling opens a promising new avenue with unique advantages over other model-order reductions based on clustering or proper orthogonal decomposition.</p>\n</div>","descriptionType":"text/plain","publishedDate":"Fri, 13 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":28321,"bgimg":"http://static.cambridge.org/content/id/urn%3Acambridge.org%3Aid%3Aarticle%3AS0022112020007855/resource/name/S0022112020007855_figAb.png?pub-status=live","linkMd5":"01e4310fd3c7f27413bf2748bea16cf2","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn87@2020_5/2020/11/15/22-48-53-835_d5d4f8b85130e81c.webp","destWidth":300,"destHeight":250,"sourceBytes":69185,"destBytes":16080,"author":"Li, Hao","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://static.cambridge.org/content/id/urn%3Acambridge.org%3Aid%3Aarticle%3AS0022112020007855/resource/name/S0022112020007855_figAb.png?pub-status=live":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn87@2020_5/2020/11/15/22-48-53-835_d5d4f8b85130e81c.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605480533286}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-11-16 06:48:53","updatedTime":"2020-11-16 06:48:53","feedId":28321,"fetchDate":"Sun, 15 Nov 2020 22:48:53 +0000","fetchMs":31428,"handleMs":9,"totalMs":32917,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":24,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"d30ce248a5f8ef1e93fb032827363e30","hostName":"us-012*","requestId":"99a5aa5bd9214abcba4f9450491605d3_28321","contentType":"application/rss+xml","totalBytes":16080,"bgimgsTotal":1,"bgimgsGithubTotal":1,"articlesImgsTotal":1,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":1,"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx11":1},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-09-07 02:43:47","updatedTime":"2020-09-07 04:47:11","id":28321,"name":"Journal of Fluid Mechanics","url":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/rss/product/id/1F51BCFAA50101CAF5CB9A20F8DEA3E4","subscriber":115,"website":null,"icon":"https://www.cambridge.org/themes/custom/corporate2020/favicon.ico","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx63/cdn13@2020_6/2020/09/06/20-47-09-780_6881cc9e5ee8419f.ico","description":"&#60;i&#62;Journal of Fluid Mechanics&#60;/i&#62; is the leading international journal in the field and is essential reading for all those concerned with developments in fluid mechanics.
