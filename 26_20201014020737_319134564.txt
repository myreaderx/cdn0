The original HomePod managed to impress audiophiles, but its high price served as a high barrier of entry to new users looking for a new smart speaker. Complicating that &#8220;smart speaker&#8221; designation is the fact that Siri was and is several years behind the intelligence of both Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, leaving the speaker as a more compromised choice for users who might have been hoping to embrace the fully smart home ecosystem.</p>\n<p>The new device starts shipping the week of November 16. The device comes in white and space grey colors.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>The HomePod Mini ditches the trashcan Mac Pro design of its bigger relative and is much more spherical in shape, still covered in a mesh fabric. It boasts the same onboard screen that allows users to summon Siri and adjust volume, while giving the device a more interesting visual look than smart devices from other companies. Also differentiating the device is Apple&#8217;s S5 chip, which the company says helps the HomePod Mini bring users its &#8220;computational audio.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Like with the original HomePod, users can arrange a stereo pair of two of the HomePod Minis and will also be able to utilize multiple HomePod devices in a home to operate a new &#8220;Intercom&#8221; experience.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2059980\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2059980\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2059980\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Homeaudio.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"370\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Homeaudio.png 3010w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Homeaudio.png?resize=150,82 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Homeaudio.png?resize=300,163 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Homeaudio.png?resize=768,417 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Homeaudio.png?resize=680,370 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Homeaudio.png?resize=1536,835 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Homeaudio.png?resize=2048,1113 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Homeaudio.png?resize=50,27 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2059980\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/tag/apple-iphone-event-2020\"><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/apple-iphone-event-2020.jpg\" /></a></p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=8kD8DneLeRQ:rOJWby2Y_SY:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=8kD8DneLeRQ:rOJWby2Y_SY:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=8kD8DneLeRQ:rOJWby2Y_SY:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=8kD8DneLeRQ:rOJWby2Y_SY:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=8kD8DneLeRQ:rOJWby2Y_SY:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=8kD8DneLeRQ:rOJWby2Y_SY:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=8kD8DneLeRQ:rOJWby2Y_SY:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=8kD8DneLeRQ:rOJWby2Y_SY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/8kD8DneLeRQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 13 Oct 2020 17:13:01 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Homeaudio.png?w=680","linkMd5":"8644962a479faff070eeab9db27494e4","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn48@2020_5/2020/10/14/02-07-00-393_ab0565ba5d219fdc.webp","destWidth":680,"destHeight":370,"sourceBytes":34784,"destBytes":34784,"author":"Lucas Matney","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Homeaudio.png?w=680":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn48@2020_5/2020/10/14/02-07-00-393_ab0565ba5d219fdc.webp","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/apple-iphone-event-2020.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn20@2020_2/2020/10/14/02-07-00-842_48e2fa61d2265c29.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn41@2020_4/2020/10/14/02-07-07-669_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn99@2020_1/2020/10/14/02-07-19-801_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn21@2020_1/2020/10/14/02-07-18-758_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=8kD8DneLeRQ:rOJWby2Y_SY:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn58@2020_5/2020/10/14/02-07-20-091_9226a2898a71c008.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=8kD8DneLeRQ:rOJWby2Y_SY:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn81@2020_6/2020/10/14/02-07-18-663_32ca5f08e109f087.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn28@2020_6/2020/10/14/02-07-19-797_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/8kD8DneLeRQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn14@2020_2/2020/10/14/02-07-18-627_c3eed4278c18255e.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602641220016},{"createdTime":"2020-10-14 10:07:00","updatedTime":"2020-10-14 10:07:00","title":"Daily Crunch: Apple introduces the iPhone 12","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2060409","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Apple embraces 5G, Facebook Messenger gets better integrated with Instagram and Kahoot raises $215 million.

a bird&#8217;s-eye view of a site to build a 3D picture, announced a new initiative today that combines drone photos with cameras on the ground or even ground robots from a company like <a

to get a picture of what a site looked like outside, uploading those photos and stitching them together into a 3D model that is accurate within an inch, according to DroneDeploy CEO Mike Winn.</p>\n<p>Winn says that while there is great value in getting this type of view of the outside of a job site, customers were hungry for a total picture that included inside and out, and the platform which is simply processing photos transmitted from drones could be adapted fairly easily to accommodate photos coming from cameras on other devices.</p><div

has been limited, making it even more important to understand the state of the site on a regular basis.</p>\n<p>&#8220;They want fewer people on those job sites, only the essential workers doing the work. So for anyone who needs information about the site, if they can get that information from a desktop or the 3D model or a kind of street view of the job site, it can really help in this COVID environment, but it also makes it much more efficient,&#8221; Winn said.</p>\n<p>He said that while companies could combine this capability with fixed cameras on the inside of a site, they don&#8217;t give the kind of coverage a ground robot could, and the Boston Dynamics robot is capable of moving around a rough job site with debris scattered around.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2059923\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2059923\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2059923\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/360-Walkthrough-Details.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"DroneDeploy bird's eye view of job site showing path taken through the site.\" width=\"680\" height=\"385\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/360-Walkthrough-Details.jpg 2560w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/360-Walkthrough-Details.jpg?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/360-Walkthrough-Details.jpg?resize=300,170 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/360-Walkthrough-Details.jpg?resize=768,434 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/360-Walkthrough-Details.jpg?resize=680,385 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/360-Walkthrough-Details.jpg?resize=1536,869 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/360-Walkthrough-Details.jpg?resize=2048,1158 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/360-Walkthrough-Details.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2059923\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> DroneDeploy</p></div></p>\n<p>While Winn sees the use of the Boston Dynamics robot as more of an end goal, he says that more likely for the immediate future you will have a human walking through the job site with a camera to capture the footage to complete the inside-outside picture for the DroneDeploy software.</p>\n<p>&#8220;All customers already want to adopt robots to collect this data, and you can imagine a Boston Dynamics robot [doing this], but that&#8217;s the end state of course.

as the organization put it.</p>\n<p>He&#8217;s hoping that the success in Seattle will activate similar communities all over the country where there are thousands more teachers in need.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We’re asking our fellow techies in the Bay Area, Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, Denver, Salt Lake City, Atlanta, Austin, Dallas, Pittsburgh and Raleigh-Durham to show teachers they matter and keep students connected across the country,&#8221; said Lerner in a press release. Naturally other cities are welcome to join in as well, but those on the list have been challenged directly.</p>\n<p>Lerner confirmed to me that Two Screens for Teachers would happily act as an intermediary, doing discounted bulk purchases of monitors (as opposed to matching individual donors with individual teachers, which was how it got started) and having regional leaders raise cash to cover the distribution to their local educators. There&#8217;s a sort of <a href=\"https://www.twoscreensforteachers.org/blog/monitors-for-all-seattle-public-school-teachers\">how-to section in this post</a> showing how to estimate the costs and find local partners.</p>\n<p>In the spirit of friendly competition, here&#8217;s hoping other cities, and the people in them looking for a way to give back tangibly in these hard times, will take up the gauntlet and get their educators this hugely helpful resource.

The company also <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/10/apple-announces-iphone-12-and-iphone-12-mini-a-new-era-for-iphone-with-5g/\">said</a> on Tuesday that consumers should expect a range of MagSafe accessories from third-party manufacturers.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll admit, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sarahintampa/status/1316059763755618304\">my mind was on PopSockets for some reason</a> before the Apple event. Which is why when MagSafe was introduced, my first thought was <em>oh, PopSockets! </em></p>\n<p>I&#8217;m probably not alone.</p>\n<p>The company has sold more than 165 million PopSockets Grips since launching in 2014, and has since expanded its grippy-things-on-the-back-of-your-phone product line to include all sorts of variations &#8212; like PopSockets with mirrors or lip gloss, tiny versions, PopSockets with wallets, Otter + PopSockets phone cases and even PopSockets that match your nails. (Oh, and they&#8217;ve got <a href=\"https://www.popsockets.com/shop/face-mask?lang=en_US\">face masks</a> to match your PopSockets now, too.)</p>\n<p>PopSockets Grips can be removed a number of times, but they can lose their stickiness over time. The company says the solution is to give the little dongle a rinse and let it air dry for about 10 minutes, then stick it back on the iPhone and let it set for a couple of hours.</p>\n<p>This can be a bit of a tedious process, which is why the company introduced PopSockets Grips with interchangeable covers, aka PopTops.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"d3De7yYrxS\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/13/this-is-the-iphone-12/\">Apple&#8217;s iPhone 12 starts at $799, sporting 5G and a magnetic adapter</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Apple&#8217;s iPhone 12 starts at $799, sporting 5G and a magnetic adapter&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/13/this-is-the-iphone-12/embed/#?secret=d3De7yYrxS\" data-secret=\"d3De7yYrxS\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>However, a line of MagSafe-compatible PopSockets line would mean you wouldn&#8217;t have to worry about the product&#8217;s stickiness wearing off.

But the Apple-owned brand had some news to share today, as well.</p>\n<p>In contrast to Apple’s offerings, the new Beats are pretty firmly focused on price. At $50, the Beats Flex are about a third the launch price of their predecessors, the similarly named BeatsX. It makes sense, certainly; as pricing has come down pretty significantly on wireless earbuds in the last few years, Beats is trying to carve out space well below $100.</p>\n<p>The headphones feature a similar yoke form factor, dangling around the wearer’s neck when not in use.

Good news, since there’s no charging case here, to speak of. There’s quick charging, as well, courtesy of the USB-C port.

Rather, it was an interface between APIs, SDKs and other digital tools and their administrators.</p>\n<p>However, over time, many developer portal elements have caused friction for partners and resulted in higher costs for the company providing the data through APIs.</p>\n<p>An alternative option to replace a developer portal is a Hybrid Integration Platform (HIP), a simple system connection solution that has the potential to generate more business through pairing ecosystems directly, efficiently and at a lower cost.</p>\n<h2>Fixing potential developer portal problems</h2>\n<p>The leading cause of friction within a developer portal is the amount of time it takes to create and support it. Quite often, an integration is delayed because the company providing the API is stuck waiting for support from the people they are working with.</p>\n<p>To fulfill the demand for consumers in different stages of maturity, companies providing APIs later realized they needed to provide more data, new business cases and different mappings and transformations.</p>\n<p>Once the portal and APIs adapt to the system, three key factors are necessary to provide a good user experience in the developer portal:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Complete and easy-to-use documentation.</li>\n<li>Actionable and effective solution options.</li>\n<li>Quick response time.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Frequently, isolated and disconnected business challenges complicate developer portal implementations. To avoid such challenges, you should address these questions before the implementation process takes place:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>How can you ensure the business will benefit from the connection with partners, suppliers and customers?</li>\n<li>Is it possible to become more efficient, have lower integration costs and improve implementation and adoption times for technological solutions?</li>\n<li>How is innovation unlocked when previously unavailable data and services are made internally available?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>When approaching a systems integration, it’s essential to develop a solution that considers business results first, before simplifying or removing any technical issues. Fixing predicted issues before they become problems only wastes time and takes the focus off the goal of making your business more efficient and profitable. Yet, many times we see the opposite happen — businesses tend to spend too much time fixing problems before they even occur.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"tkD0XmKwfb\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/28/can-api-vendors-solve-healthcares-data-woes/\">Can API vendors solve healthcare&#8217;s data woes?</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Can API vendors solve healthcare&#8217;s data woes?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/28/can-api-vendors-solve-healthcares-data-woes/embed/#?secret=tkD0XmKwfb\" data-secret=\"tkD0XmKwfb\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p><div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=7ZcYVHXcosI:uTPlEiFrlcE:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=7ZcYVHXcosI:uTPlEiFrlcE:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=7ZcYVHXcosI:uTPlEiFrlcE:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=7ZcYVHXcosI:uTPlEiFrlcE:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=7ZcYVHXcosI:uTPlEiFrlcE:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=7ZcYVHXcosI:uTPlEiFrlcE:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=7ZcYVHXcosI:uTPlEiFrlcE:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=7ZcYVHXcosI:uTPlEiFrlcE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/7ZcYVHXcosI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 13 Oct 2020 18:10:32 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"8371cb4ae052a18e2fbd0b3fa54064eb","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn41@2020_4/2020/10/14/02-07-07-669_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Walter Thompson","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn41@2020_4/2020/10/14/02-07-07-669_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn99@2020_1/2020/10/14/02-07-19-801_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn21@2020_1/2020/10/14/02-07-18-758_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=7ZcYVHXcosI:uTPlEiFrlcE:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn72@2020_2/2020/10/14/02-07-19-604_4e1c5cfb33dda6ee.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=7ZcYVHXcosI:uTPlEiFrlcE:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn63@2020_1/2020/10/14/02-07-18-819_269613eea127a083.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn28@2020_6/2020/10/14/02-07-19-797_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/7ZcYVHXcosI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn2@2020_5/2020/10/14/02-07-18-730_a96fd385ca03618d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602641220019},{"createdTime":"2020-10-14 10:07:00","updatedTime":"2020-10-14 10:07:00","title":"Apple launches new ecosystem of accessories and wireless chargers with MagSafe","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2060130","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Apple just announced <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/13/this-is-the-iphone-12/\">the iPhone 12</a>, and it features some new capabilities hidden in the rear of the phone.

Apple will no longer include those items in the box, part of a redoubled effort to reduce its environmental footprint.</p>\n<p>In a segment of its iPhone-centric event today, Apple&#8217;s Lisa Jackson explained that the company is hoping to have &#8220;net zero climate impact&#8221; globally by 2030, meaning everything from manufacturing and assembly to packaging and device recycling will be carbon neutral. Achieving that means relying more on solar power and efficient operations, of course, but also reducing waste.</p>\n<p>To that end the company will no longer include the familiar white headphones that have come in the box since the early days of the iPhone, nor the standard outlet adapter for the power cable.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Customers already have over 700 million Lightning headphones, and many customers have moved to a wireless experience,&#8221; said Jackson. &#8220;There are also over 2 billion Apple power adapters out in the world, and that&#8217;s not counting the billions of third-party adapters.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"FQWaSPJ6UC\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/18/apple-expands-global-recycling-programs-announces-new-material-recovery-lab-in-austin/\">Apple expands global recycling programs, announces new Material Recovery Lab in Austin</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Apple expands global recycling programs, announces new Material Recovery Lab in Austin&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/18/apple-expands-global-recycling-programs-announces-new-material-recovery-lab-in-austin/embed/#?secret=FQWaSPJ6UC\" data-secret=\"FQWaSPJ6UC\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>Thankfully there will be a power cable in the box: a standard USB-C to Lightning cable that you can plug into your old wall adapter or a laptop.

To be honest, you might need a dongle.</p>\n<p>The result is not just fewer things in the box, but a smaller actual box, letting the company fit more of them into a pallet. That may sound like a bit of a stretch for effect — &#8220;really, you&#8217;re saving the world by making the box smaller?&#8221; — but at the scales Apple operates at, fitting half again as many devices into a shipment means saving thousands of trips. It&#8217;s the equivalent, Apple notes, of taking some 450,000 cars off the road per year.</p>\n<p>Apple didn&#8217;t mention its part in creating an endless yearly cycle of questionably necessary replacements of perfectly good devices, or in making millions of accessories obsolete with choices like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/25/i-still-miss-the-headphone-port/\">removing the headphone jack</a>, but that&#8217;s to be expected.

This produces a good-looking image at the cost of customizability; once you throw away that &#8220;extra&#8221; information, the colors and tone are restricted to a much narrower range of adjustment.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2060324\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/apple_proraw.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2060324\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"vertical wp-image-2060324\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/apple_proraw.jpg\" alt=\"An iPhone showing the camera app shooting in RAW mode.\" width=\"350\" height=\"709\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/apple_proraw.jpg 426w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/apple_proraw.jpg?resize=74,150 74w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/apple_proraw.jpg?resize=148,300 148w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/apple_proraw.jpg?resize=336,680 336w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/apple_proraw.jpg?resize=25,50 25w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2060324\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>\n<p>RAW files are the answer to this, as DSLR photographers know — they&#8217;re a minimally processed representation of what the sensor collects, letting the user do all the work to make the photo look good. Being able to shoot to a RAW format (or RAW-adjacent; we&#8217;ll know more with hands-on testing) frees up photographers who may have felt hemmed in by the iPhone&#8217;s default image processing. There were ways of getting around this before, but Apple has an advantage over third-party apps with its low-level access to the camera architecture, so this format will probably be the new standard.</p>\n<p>This newfound elasticity at the image format level also enables the iPhone Pros to shoot in Dolby Vision, a grading standard usually applied in editing suites after you shoot your movie or commercial on a digital cinema camera. Shooting directly to it may be helpful to people planning to use the format but shooting with iPhones as B cameras. If cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki approves, it&#8217;s good enough for pretty much everyone else on Earth. I sincerely doubt anyone will cut their work together on the phone, though.</p>\n<p>These two advances, ProRAW and Dolby, suggest that Apple&#8217;s improved silicon has left a lot of wiggle room in the photography backend. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/22/the-future-of-photography-is-code/\">As I&#8217;ve written before,</a> this is the most important segment of the imaging workflow right now, and the company is probably coming up with all kinds of ways to take advantage of the power offered by the latest chips.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"jYOhmXq12Z\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/22/the-future-of-photography-is-code/\">The future of photography is code</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;The future of photography is code&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/22/the-future-of-photography-is-code/embed/#?secret=jYOhmXq12Z\" data-secret=\"jYOhmXq12Z\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>Though larger cameras and lenses still offer advantages that the iPhone can never hope to match, the reverse is true as well. And the closer the iPhone gets to offering cinema-like quality — even if it&#8217;s simulated — the greater its advantages of portability and ease of use grow in proportion. Apple has been ruthlessly targeting enthusiast photographers, who aren&#8217;t quite sure if they want to buy a DSLR or mirrorless system in addition to a phone with a nice camera. By sweetening the deal on the phone side, Apple surely rakes in more of these users every generation.</p>\n<p>Of course the Pro phones come at a significant premium over the normal range of iPhone devices (the Max <em>starts</em> at $1,099), but these improvements aren&#8217;t impossible or really even difficult to bring to lower-end models — most of them will probably trickle down next year. Of course, by then a whole new set of features will have been cooked up for the Pro devices. For photographers, however, planned obsolescence is part of the lifestyle.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/tag/apple-iphone-event-2020\"><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/apple-iphone-event-2020.jpg\" /></a></p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=HQgnC_KXgc4:_qavXZNNWiE:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=HQgnC_KXgc4:_qavXZNNWiE:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=HQgnC_KXgc4:_qavXZNNWiE:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=HQgnC_KXgc4:_qavXZNNWiE:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=HQgnC_KXgc4:_qavXZNNWiE:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=HQgnC_KXgc4:_qavXZNNWiE:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=HQgnC_KXgc4:_qavXZNNWiE:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=HQgnC_KXgc4:_qavXZNNWiE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/HQgnC_KXgc4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 13 Oct 2020 20:46:10 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/lens-elements.jpg","linkMd5":"2d7702c4dc313da11d85ab4b2e0bbdf3","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn36@2020_5/2020/10/14/02-07-10-610_7d8920ed21f3941b.webp","destWidth":1069,"destHeight":769,"sourceBytes":101754,"destBytes":22084,"author":"Devin Coldewey","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/lens-elements.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn36@2020_5/2020/10/14/02-07-10-610_7d8920ed21f3941b.webp","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/appleproraw.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn95@2020_6/2020/10/14/02-07-19-716_07ad20d4f2cc566b.webp","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/apple_proraw.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn3@2020_4/2020/10/14/02-07-19-023_1d322ed943ce6eda.webp","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/apple-iphone-event-2020.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn20@2020_2/2020/10/14/02-07-00-842_48e2fa61d2265c29.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn41@2020_4/2020/10/14/02-07-07-669_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn99@2020_1/2020/10/14/02-07-19-801_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn21@2020_1/2020/10/14/02-07-18-758_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=HQgnC_KXgc4:_qavXZNNWiE:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn24@2020_6/2020/10/14/02-07-19-441_2dc0905a6e50e453.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=HQgnC_KXgc4:_qavXZNNWiE:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn39@2020_4/2020/10/14/02-07-19-574_6874ed48cb538d99.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn28@2020_6/2020/10/14/02-07-19-797_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/HQgnC_KXgc4":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn10@2020_5/2020/10/14/02-07-18-639_384131de19b9592c.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602641220016},{"createdTime":"2020-10-14 10:07:00","updatedTime":"2020-10-14 10:07:00","title":"Apple’s stock dips and Verizon’s recovers during iPhone event","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2060256","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Earlier today Apple announced a slew of new hardware.

Add to that the fact that the company is keeping the 11 around at a lower price point, and that leaves iOS devotees with more options than ever when it comes to purchasing a new handset, with starting prices ranging from $599 to $1,099. And, of course, configurations go up from there.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"VzCH6ovfEY\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/13/apple-unveils-its-flagship-5g-phones-the-iphone-12-pro-and-pro-max/\">Apple unveils its flagship 5G phones, the iPhone 12 Pro and Pro Max</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Apple unveils its flagship 5G phones, the iPhone 12 Pro and Pro Max&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/13/apple-unveils-its-flagship-5g-phones-the-iphone-12-pro-and-pro-max/embed/#?secret=VzCH6ovfEY\" data-secret=\"VzCH6ovfEY\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p class=\"p1\">All of the new devices announced today share some key common features: 5G connectivity, the new magnetic MagSafe connector, OLED displays and the A14 chip, for starters.

From there, however, things get more complicated.
