And while some write out a formal to-do list to keep track of tasks, for others, their to-do list is their tabs in Chrome. However you get things done, we want Chrome to help you be more productive. Today we’re sharing a number of improvements, including tabs that load faster and new features that let you organize and find them easily. </p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p></p><h3>Get more done, with 10 percent faster tabs in Chrome</h3><p></p><p>When you’re checking off one task after another from your to-do list, waiting even a few seconds while your tabs load can slow you down.  These <a href=\"https://blog.chromium.org/2020/08/chrome-just-got-faster-with-profile.html\">under-the-hood performance improvements</a> will make your Chrome tabs load up to 10 percent faster. </p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p></p><h3>Group your tabs, then collapse them</h3><p></p><p><a href=\"https://blog.google/products/chrome/manage-tabs-with-google-chrome/\">Tab groups</a> help you visually distinguish your tabs by topic or task—like work or shopping—or even priority. Now you can collapse and expand your tab groups, so it's easier to see the ones you need to access. This was the most popular feature request we heard from those of you using tab groups, and as we begin rolling out this functionality, we hope you’ll give it a try.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \"><img alt=\"Tab Groups-Expand_Collapse.gif\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Tab_Groups-Expand_Collapse.gif\"/></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>New touch-friendly tabs for tablet mode</h3><p>If you use Chrome in your laptop’s tablet mode, you’ll soon have an easier time flipping through your tabs, finding the page you’re looking for, and browsing the web. Coming to Chromebooks first, a new touchscreen interface has tabs that are larger and more practical to organize, and hide when you don’t need them.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \"><img alt=\"TouchpadTab_Manager.gif\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/TouchpadTab_Manager.gif\"/></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>Switch to an already-open tab</h3><p>Rolling out on Android in this release, when you start typing a page title into the address bar, you’ll see a suggestion to switch to that tab if you already have it open. You can already do this in Chrome on your laptop.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--medium h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--4 h-c-grid__col--offset-4 \"><img alt=\"Switch to Tab on Android.png\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Switch_to_Tab_on_Android.max-1000x1000.png\"/><figcaption class=\"article-image__caption \"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>If you already have the page open, you’ll see a new suggestion to switch to that tab.</p></div></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>Find your tab faster with tab previews</h3><p>It can be frustrating to click through multiple tabs trying to find the one you want. Coming to Chrome Beta to try out this release, you can hover over a tab and quickly see a thumbnail preview of the page. This is useful when you have lots of tabs that look the same (how did I end up with this many Google Docs tabs, anyway?).</p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \"><img alt=\"Hover_Preview.gif\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Hover_Preview.gif\"/></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>Fill out and save PDFs in Chrome</h3><p>In this Chrome release, we’re also going beyond tabs to improve Chrome’s PDF functionality. Over the next few weeks, you’ll be able to fill out PDF forms and save them with your inputs, directly from Chrome. If you open the file again, you can pick up where you left off.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \"><img alt=\"PDF-Editor.gif\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/PDF-Editor.gif\"/></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>URL sharing made easier</h3><p>For Android users, we’ve improved  URL sharing to help you quickly copy a link, send it to Chrome on your other devices, and send links through other apps. You can also print the page or generate a QR code to scan or download. This new QR code feature is also rolling out to Chrome on desktop and can be accessed from a new QR icon in the Chrome address bar.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--medium h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--4 h-c-grid__col--offset-4 \"><img alt=\"Copy of QR_Code_Dino.png\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Copy_of_QR_Code_Dino.max-1000x1000.png\"/></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>We hope all these updates will make it easier and faster to browse and get things done in Chrome. We prioritize keeping Chrome stable, so features sometimes take time until they roll out to every browser. Follow us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/googlechrome?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Twitter</a> to get the latest updates on feature
