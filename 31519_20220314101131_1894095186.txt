When he learned that I worked on Google Translate, he got excited. He told me Translate’s conversation mode helped him chat with his hosts about family, politics, culture and more. Thanks to Translate, he said, he connected more deeply with people around him while in France.</p><br/>The passenger I met isn't alone. Google Translate on Android hit one billion installs from the <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.translate\">Google Play Store</a> this March, and each one represents a story of people being able to better connect with one another. By understanding 109 languages (and counting!), Translate enables conversation and communication between millions of people which otherwise would have been impossible. And Translate itself has gone through countless changes on the path to one billion installs. Here’s how it has evolved so far.</div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph_with_image\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid uni-paragraph-wrap\"><div class=\"uni-paragraph h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3\" data-component=\"uni-article-paragraph\"><div class=\" article-image--wrap-medium \"><img alt=\"A screenshot of one of the earliest versions of the Google Translate app for Android.\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/android1.max-1000x1000.png\" tabindex=\"0\"/><figcaption class=\"article-image__caption h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3 \"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>One of the earliest versions of the Google Translate app for Android.</p></div></figcaption></div><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>January 2010: App launches</h3><p></p><p>We released our Android app in January 2010, just over a year after the first commercial Android device was launched. As people started using the new Translate app over the next few years, we added a number of features to improve their experience, including early versions of conversation mode, offline translation and translating handwritten or printed text.<br/><br/></p><h3>January 2014: 100+ million</h3><p></p><p>Our Android app crossed 100 million installs exactly four years after we first launched it. In 2014, Google acquired QuestVisual, the maker of WordLens. Together with the WordLens team, Translate’s goal was to introduce an advanced visual translation experience in our app. Within eight months, the team delivered the ability to <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/translate/hallo-hola-ola-more-powerful-translate/\">instantly translate text using a phone camera</a>, just as the app reached 200 million installs.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"h-c-page\"><div class=\" article-image h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 \"><img alt=\"An animation showing a person using Google Lens on a smartphone, taking a picture of a sign in Russian that is translated to “Access to City.”\" class=\"article-image--large\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Google-Word-Lens_4vHEvUA.gif\" tabindex=\"0\"/></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p></p><h3>November 2015: 300+ million</h3><p>As it approached 300 million installs, Translate improved in two major ways.
