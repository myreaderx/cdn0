Statistically, there should be over 100 billion planets in our Milky Way galaxy. They come in a wide range of sizes and characteristics, largely unimagined before exoplanets were first discovered in the mid-1990s. The biggest motivation for perusing these worlds is to find \"Genesis II,\" a planet where life has arisen and evolved beyond microbes. The ultimate payoff would be finding intelligent life off the Earth.</p> <p>A major step in searching for habitable planets is finding suitable stars that could foster the emergence of complex organisms. Because our Sun has nurtured life on Earth for nearly 4 billion years, conventional wisdom would suggest that stars like it would be prime candidates. But stars like our Sun represent only about 10% of the Milky Way population. What's more, they are comparatively short-lived. Our Sun is halfway through its estimated 10 billion-year lifetime.</p> <p>Complex organisms arose on Earth only 500 million years ago. And, the modern form of humans has been here only for the blink of an eye on cosmological timescales: 200,000 years. The future of humanity is unknown. But what is for certain is that Earth will become uninhabitable for higher forms of life in a little over 1 billion years, as the Sun grows warmer and desiccates our planet.</p> <p>Therefore, stars slightly cooler than our Sun — called orange dwarfs — are considered better hang-outs for advanced life. They can burn steadily for tens of billions of years. This opens up a vast timescape for biological evolution to pursue an infinity of experiments for yielding robust life forms. And, for every star like our Sun there are three times as many orange dwarfs in the Milky Way.</p> <p>The only type of star that is more abundant are red dwarfs. But these are feisty little stars. They are so magnetically active they pump out 500 times as much radiation in the form of X-rays and ultraviolet light as our Sun does. Planets around these stars take a beating. They would be no place to call home for organisms like us.</p> <p>An emerging idea, bolstered by stellar surveys performed by Hubble and other telescopes, is that the orange dwarfs are \"Goldilocks stars\" — not too hot, not too cool, and above all, not too violent to host life-friendly planets over a vast horizon of cosmic time. </p> </br></img>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 08 Jan 2020 20:10:00 +0000","feedId":17949,"bgimg":"https://imgsrc.hubblesite.org/hvi/uploads/image_file/image_attachment/31999/STSCI-H-p2006a-f-16666x10000.jpg","linkMd5":"4df550bf48f0d2a0264687870efcbea0","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn30@2020_4/2020/11/17/17-08-10-623_0ec2346975d26fb7.webp","destWidth":0,"destHeight":0,"sourceBytes":7198140,"destBytes":0,"author":"outreach@stsci.edu (Space Telescope Science Institute)","enclosureType":"image/jpeg","enclosureUrl":"//imgsrc.hubblesite.org/hvi/uploads/image_file/image_attachment/31999/STSCI-H-p2006a-f-16666x10000.jpg","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://imgsrc.hubblesite.org/hvi/uploads/story/display_image/1331/low_STSCI-H-p2006a-k-1340x520.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn13@2020_6/2020/11/17/17-05-30-046_7817434351201379.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605632729584}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-11-18 01:05:29","updatedTime":"2020-11-18 01:05:29","feedId":17949,"fetchDate":"Tue, 17 Nov 2020 17:05:29 +0000","fetchMs":275,"handleMs":614,"totalMs":163051,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":1217,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"7be5a6429a423a68cef7abf798e66509","hostName":"us-034*","requestId":"2433196fc4484b16a2da177a66f1c540_17949","contentType":"application/rss+xml; charset=utf-8","totalBytes":14148,"bgimgsTotal":1,"bgimgsGithubTotal":1,"articlesImgsTotal":1,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":1,"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx27":1,"myreaderx33":1,"myreaderx12":1},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-09-07 02:16:21","updatedTime":"2020-09-07 02:48:47","id":17949,"name":"Hubble - News feed","url":"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/newscenter_rss.php","subscriber":185,"website":null,"icon":"https://imgsrc.hubblesite.org/hvi/uploads/collection/image_attachment/2/RSS_image_news.jpg","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx61/cdn24@2020_2/2020/09/06/18-48-45-631_3a7d6e7bc0a840c8.jpg","description":"This news collection compiles news releases and supporting materials published by the Officeof Public Outreach of the Space Telescope Science Institute, to further your knowledge of astronomy.
