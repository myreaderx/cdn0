I believe there would be a good correlation between usage and number of app reviews left.</p>\n\n<p>Looking at the last month (approximately 1 million reviews for 34,000 iOS apps) here was the top countries and their major languages:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/stuartkhall.com/App+Translations/top+countries.png\" /></p>\n\n<p>Collating that together I got:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/stuartkhall.com/App+Translations/languages.png\"><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/stuartkhall.com/App+Translations/languages.png\" alt=\"Languages\" /></a></p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n<h3>Languages You Must Do</h3>\n\n<p>You really should localise to English and Chinese (Simplified and Traditional), this will get you 53% coverage by my numbers.</p>\n\n<h3>Second Round</h3>\n\n<p>Next look at Japanese, Spanish, French, German, Russian, Portuguese and Korean, this will get you to almost 85% (probably even higher, I didn't look at all the countries of in long tail countries, many more of them probably also speak these languages).</p>\n\n<h3>The Long Tail</h3>\n\n<p>I didn't take the time to look beyond these top languages, but some other languages like Thai, Turkish, Dutch, Swedish, Malay, Danish, Vietnamese etc (this list could get really long) will help you get closer to 100%.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>If you are looking to localize I have always been happy with <a href=\"http://www.icanlocalize.com/my/invite/36773\">ICanLocalize</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Did I miss anything? <a href=\"http://twitter.com/stuartkhall\">Let me know on Twitter</a>.</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/stuartkhall/~4/auDkEUJ9CqQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Mon, 07 Jul 2014 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":26337,"bgimg":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/stuartkhall.com/App+Translations/top+countries.png","linkMd5":"e9330f9a836e387bd6507aa66e8b213e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn20@2020_5/2020/10/20/04-05-37-212_de82a51bf5a34b39.webp","destWidth":1126,"destHeight":1338,"sourceBytes":58073,"destBytes":73650,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://s3.amazonaws.com/stuartkhall.com/App+Translations/top+countries.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn20@2020_5/2020/10/20/04-05-37-212_de82a51bf5a34b39.webp","https://s3.amazonaws.com/stuartkhall.com/App+Translations/languages.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn27@2020_2/2020/10/20/04-05-38-176_9dcad98fea62c2c4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/stuartkhall/~4/auDkEUJ9CqQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn24@2020_2/2020/10/20/04-05-38-108_3163d640ba219c0e.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603166737061}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-10-20 12:05:37","updatedTime":"2020-10-20 12:05:37","feedId":26337,"fetchDate":"Tue, 20 Oct 2020 04:05:37 +0000","fetchMs":53,"handleMs":180363,"totalMs":182350,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":20,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"0b4009930f9af5660966c5695d71af7c","hostName":"us-022*","requestId":"2d85c4b2ac55443a9adaf3b80732528c_26337","contentType":"text/xml;
