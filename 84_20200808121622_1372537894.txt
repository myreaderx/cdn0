A few days ago, Apple revealed four upcoming Apple Arcade games through the iOS 14 Coming Soon section. These include some games not even announced for the service and other surprises. Read about <em>Samurai Jack: Battle Through Time</em>, <em>The Last Campfire</em>, <em>Next Stop Nowhere</em>, and <em>World’s End Club</em> <a href=\"https://toucharcade.com/2020/08/05/apple-arcade-the-last-campfire-worlds-end-club-samurai-jack-next-stop-nowhere-release-dates/\">here</a> with their releases dates revealed beginning next week. Today, <em>Game of Thrones: Tale of Crows</em> <a href=\"http://toucharcade.com/link/http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id1483071787?mt=8\">()</a> from Devolver Digital and That Silly Studio (<em><a href=\"https://toucharcade.com/2017/05/08/spaceplan-review-delicious-potatoes/\">Spaceplan</a></em>) just arrived on Apple Arcade. It is narrative idle game set in the Game of Thrones universe 8000 years before Jon Snow took the Black. Watch the trailer for <em>Game of Thrones: Tale of Crows</em> with some gameplay below:</p> \n<p> </p>\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div> \n<div class=\"video-responsive\"> \n <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/bnTrCVGM2_I\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</div> \n<p></p> \n<p>In <em>Game of Thrones: Tale of Crows</em>, time passes in the game even if you aren’t playing it. The game can send you notifications (assuming you enable them), to know when something happens in-game as you send expeditions beyond the wall. With this week’s reveals, I figured we’d only get an update or two if at all today on Apple Arcade. A new game from Devolver Digital and the developer of <em><a href=\"https://toucharcade.com/2017/05/05/toucharcade-game-of-the-week-spaceplan/\">Spaceplan</a></em> is definitely a good surprise and it looks and sounds gorgeous so far. It is also playable in portrait mode on iPhone which is always a welcome addition for these kinds of games. If you’d like to check it out, <em>Game of Thrones: Tale of Crows</em> is available on Apple Arcade now here. For all other Apple Arcade related things, check out our dedicated <a href=\"https://toucharcade.com/community/forums/apple-arcade/\">Apple Arcade forum</a> for discussion on the service and every game included <a href=\"https://toucharcade.com/community/forums/apple-arcade/\">here</a>.

The <em>Facebook Gaming</em> app allows users to watch streams and play games on Android. On iOS, the mini games aren’t included thanks to Apple’s App Store policies. These games are also included in the <a href=\"https://toucharcade.com/2017/05/02/facebook-messenger-games-go-global-with-more-than-50-games-available/\">main Facebook apps like Messenger</a> but have been buried in the iOS apps for years according to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/7/21358355/facebook-apple-app-store-policies-comments-facebook-gaming-ios\">statements made by Facebook to The Verge</a>. </p> \n<p><img src=\"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270654\" alt=\"\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1152\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-270659\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/B544C71E-8D99-46E1-B582-877E2F9AB090.png 2048w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/B544C71E-8D99-46E1-B582-877E2F9AB090-300x169.png 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/B544C71E-8D99-46E1-B582-877E2F9AB090-768x432.png 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/B544C71E-8D99-46E1-B582-877E2F9AB090-1024x576.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p>Facebook even tried to use Apple’s new appeal process for <em>Facebook Gaming</em> but didn’t receive a response as <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/7/21358355/facebook-apple-app-store-policies-comments-facebook-gaming-ios\">confirmed to The Verge</a>. After months of rejections, Facebook removed the actual games from <em>Facebook Gaming</em> and only release it as an app for watching streams like <em>Twitch</em>. We’ve been covering Microsoft’s <em>Project xCloud</em> for a while now and it has been super disappointing (<a href=\"https://toucharcade.com/2018/05/24/apple-rejects-steam-link/\">but sadly expected given Apple</a>) to see how it has played out as we get closer to its launch next month. Apple’s <a href=\"https://toucharcade.com/2020/08/06/apples-statement-regarding-xcloud-on-ios/\">statement to Business Insider</a> is hilarious given some of the kinds of games and apps the company approves. As of now, <em>Facebook Gaming</em> is available on the App Store for iOS <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/in/app/facebook-gaming/id1496439256\">here</a> and Google Play for Android <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.facebook.games&amp;hl=en_IN\">here</a>.

In today’s article, we’ve got summaries of all of the new releases of the day, including two NEOGEO Pocket Color fighters and a nice bundle of puzzles. We’ve also got complete lists of incoming and outgoing sales, with great games like <em>Cat Quest</em>, <em>Iconoclasts</em>, and <em>Super Hydorah</em> getting nice discounts. No news section today, but the only major news at the time of writing was the announcement that indie darling <em>Braid</em> will be making its way to the platform. Let’s get to the new stuff!</p> \n<h3><strong>New Releases</strong></h3> \n<h3><strong>Piczle Lines DX Bundle ($19.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270645\" src=\"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270644\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/piczlelinesdxbundle.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/piczlelinesdxbundle-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/piczlelinesdxbundle-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/piczlelinesdxbundle-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p><strong>SwitchArcade Highlight!</strong></p> \n<p>Hey friend, do you like <em>Slitherlink/Pathpix-</em>style logic puzzles? Do you like… saving money? Have you somehow not bought <em>Piczle Lines DX</em> and <em>Piczle Lines DX 500 More Puzzles</em> yet? If the answer to all three of those is “yes\", have I got a bundle for you. It packs in both of the aforementioned titles, offering a five dollar savings over buying them separately. You get a stupendous 1,100 puzzles to solve, offering something like a couple hundred hours of enjoyment. The wild thing is that if you grab this bundle during the launch sale, you can get it for a mere ten bucks. If you’re reading this after the launch sale, be sure to check on the prices of the individual games just to make sure this bundle’s price is still in your favor.</p> \n<h3><strong>King of Fighters R-2 ($7.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270646\" src=\"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270644\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"562\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/kingoffightersr2.jpg 1000w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/kingoffightersr2-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/kingoffightersr2-768x432.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p><strong>SwitchArcade Highlight!</strong></p> \n<p>One of the earlier fighting games for the NEOGEO Pocket Color, <em>King of Fighters R-2</em> nevertheless remains a very enjoyable fighting game with lots to offer. There are 14 characters available initially, with a further 11 variants that you’ll unlock through play. Since it’s roughly based on King of Fighters ’98, you can expect a good selection of the more popular characters from that title. The gameplay is fun, and Code Mystics have done a lovely job with the interface and options, even going so far as to allow you to play using touch controls on an on-screen NEOGEO Pocket Color.</p> \n<h3><strong>Samurai Shodown! 2 ($7.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270647\" src=\"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270644\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"562\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/samuraishodown2ngpc.jpg 1000w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/samuraishodown2ngpc-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/samuraishodown2ngpc-768x432.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p><strong>SwitchArcade Highlight!</strong></p> \n<p>The other NEOGEO Pocket Color release today was actually already made available before on the Switch as a pre-order bonus for the new <em>Samurai Shodown</em>. What’s neat about this one is that it’s a bite-sized adaptation of <em>Samurai Shodown 64: Warriors Rage,</em> featuring all but one of the characters from that game. On top of that, it adds Charlotte and Yagyu Jubei. Since SNK probably isn’t going to release ports of Hyper NEOGEO 64 games anytime soon, this is your best chance for getting some of the experience of playing one of the lesser-known<em> Samurai Shodown</em> titles. There are fifteen characters to choose from here, and Code Mystics has done a fine job of bringing the game to the Switch with lots of options.</p> \n<h3><strong>RogueCube ($4.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270648\" src=\"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270644\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/roguecube.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/roguecube-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/roguecube-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/roguecube-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p>This is basically the poor man’s <em>Enter the Gungeon</em>. You can play through the campaign either solo or with friends via local multiplayer, or head into a competitive battle with those same friends. The characters are all cubes, and the levels are procedurally generated, so there’s the title taken care of. You get three different cube characters to choose from initially, with several more available once you unlock them. There are 37 weapons ranging from swords to bazookas with a whole lot in between, and 11 different levels to rampage through. Not bad at all for five dollars, to be honest.</p> \n<h3><strong>Retro Arcade Shooter – Attack from Pluto ($5.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270649\" src=\"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270644\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/retroarcadeshooterattackfrompluto.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/retroarcadeshooterattackfrompluto-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/retroarcadeshooterattackfrompluto-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/retroarcadeshooterattackfrompluto-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p>This game claims to offer three classic arcade shoot-em-up games in one, but there isn’t quite as much variety as you would hope given a statement like that. There are horizontal and vertical shoot-em-up stages in here, with the latter being a bit better than the former. Still, nothing in here is really all that well-made relative to other shooters around the same price on the Switch. I can’t see any reason why someone would bother playing this over roughly 73 other shoot-em-ups on the platform, but every game is someone’s favorite. Some games stretch my belief in that more than others, though.</p> \n<h3><strong>City Bus Driving Simulator ($11.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270650\" src=\"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270644\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/citybusdrivingsimulator.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/citybusdrivingsimulator-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/citybusdrivingsimulator-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/citybusdrivingsimulator-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p>Yeah, it’s another one of these. Like the several games similar to it that have released on Switch over the last couple of months,<em> City Bus Driving Simulator</em> is a port of a free-to-play mobile game that largely hangs its hat on letting you drive a variety of vehicles in an urban environment. There are missions to complete and free-roam mode for when you just want to cruise around in a school bus. There are twelve different buses in all that you’ll be driving, and the game claims it uses a fun and realistic driving model, which seems to me to be a cake that you cannot have and also eat when it comes to buses. Well, someone is buying these things. If it’s you, here’s another one.</p> \n<h3><strong>Wordify ($2.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270651\" src=\"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270644\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/wordify.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/wordify-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/wordify-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/wordify-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p>Well, it’s hard to mess up a word game. And this one isn’t going to break that rule. You’re given a bunch of letters and need to fit them onto the crossword layout such that the words work. You get 250 of these puzzles for your three bucks, and there are ten different color themes so that you can change things up visually now and then. You can play using buttons or touch controls, with the latter being a bit more comfortable to use. Not a bad choice if you enjoy word games and don’t want to spend too much money today.</p> \n<h3><strong>Sales</strong></h3> \n<p><em><strong>(North American eShop, US Prices)</strong></em></p> \n<p>Hey, there’s the big list of new sales I was expecting when I went home last night. Plenty of great games in there, with some highlights including excellent prices on the <em>Cat Quest</em> games, a very rare sale on the full line of <em>Picross</em> titles, and huge discounts on the <em>Secret Files</em> adventure games. There’s plenty of fun games to be had at nice prices, so make sure you have a good look through the list. By contrast, there’s very little in the way of expiring sales this weekend. Feel free to blow your allowance on the new stuff.</p> \n<p><strong>Select New Games on Sale</strong></p> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-268393\"

However, I still can’t get enough <em>Gun Rounds</em>! I talked about this <a href=\"https://toucharcade.com/2020/08/03/gun-rounds-now-available/\">in our post</a> announcing the game’s release on Monday, but just to reiterate, <em>Gun Rounds</em> is heavily inspired by Moppin’s legendary <em>Downwell</em> in pretty much all ways except the core gameplay. The visual style, the structure of the levels, the power-up system and roguelike features… all these feel incredibly <em>Downwell</em>-y. But when it comes to what you actually DO when playing, these two games couldn’t be more different.</p> \n<p><em>Gun Rounds</em> is a semi-turn-based shooter. You play in portrait with your character near the bottom of the screen and a group of enemies milling about at the top of the screen. For each turn, you choose from your available weapons at the bottom of the screen and then touch and drag to create an aiming arrow to determine which enemy that weapon will fire at. Letting go of the screen fires that weapon, and then it’s the enemy’s turn to attack. Here is where the “semi\" in semi-turn-based comes in, because you’re actually able to tap the screen while an attack is incoming, and if you time it appropriately you’ll block that enemy’s shot. Enemies do take turns to attack but it’s in fairly quick succession, so you need to really stay alert and have lightning fast reflexes if you want to block all the incoming attacks.</p> \n<p> </p>\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div> \n<div class=\"video-responsive\"> \n <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XmqWXMS0qqc\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</div> \n<p></p> \n<p>There’s a huge benefit to blocking shots, too. Not only will you not take damage but you’ll also regain some of your ammo. Each weapon takes a certain amount of ammo and in general the more powerful attacks use up more ammo than the lighter attacks. Running out of ammo is… not good, and you do have a manual Reload button but using it comes at the cost of being able to attack during your turn as well as a significantly smaller area for you to block incoming attacks with. So you lose your ability to attack that round, AND the incoming attacks are harder to block. It’s a stiff trade-off, which is why you should really practice on blocking incoming attacks the best that you can.</p> \n<p>That’s easier said than done though! One of the strengths of <em>Gun Rounds</em> is in its variety. There are tons of different types of enemies, and they all have a number of different ways to attack you. You’ll need to be ready to defend attacks of different speeds and from different directions, and it is <strong>incredibly</strong> satisfying to block every shot in a round. And that’s not even getting into the extensive and incredibly off the wall weapons in your own arsenal. Basically, playing <em>Gun Rounds</em> just doesn’t get old, and with a long-term progression system tied to unlocking an ungodly number of color palettes, you always feel like you’re getting <em>something</em> out of that “just one more go\" feeling you get by playing. </p> \n<p>There’s probably even more I could say about <em>Gun Rounds</em>, and usually when I just can’t shut up about a game that means it’s a winner. This is basically a perfect mobile game. Yeah, I said it! If you like extremely awesome games that feel like they were tailor-made for mobile, three bucks for <em>Gun Rounds</em> will feel like you’re stealing it.</p> \n<p></p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 08 Aug 2020 00:35:43 +0000","feedId":84,"bgimg":"https://toucharcade.com/wp-content/images/app/1517958901/100x100bb.jpg","linkMd5":"40746305492d7c8d5d4982038d14b7e3","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn67@2020_3/2020-08-08/1596888978799_eec12a73c3b7139e.webp","author":"Jared Nelson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://toucharcade.com/wp-content/images/app/1517958901/100x100bb.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn67@2020_3/2020-08-08/1596888978799_eec12a73c3b7139e.webp"}}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-08-08 20:15:51","updatedTime":"2020-08-08 20:15:51","feedId":84,"fetchDate":"Sat, 08 Aug 2020 12:15:51 +0000","fetchMs":3475,"handleMs":3535,"totalMs":38808,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":10,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"3.248.106.3","hostName":"europe-001.herokuapp.com","requestId":"c77d4fa35d424a4f9679729ef764e38b_84","bgimgsTotal":5,"bgimgsGithubTotal":5,"articlesImgsTotal":5,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":3},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-05-30 17:21:38","updatedTime":"2020-08-07 17:39:28","id":84,"name":"TouchArcade","url":"http://toucharcade.com/feed/","subscriber":null,"website":null,"icon":"https://toucharcade.com/apple-touch-icon.png","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn22@2020_5/2020-08-08/1596888948758_cbd6ace865006824.webp","description":"iPhone and iPad Games","weekly":null,"link":"https://toucharcade.com"},"extra4":{"start":1596888943845,"total":0,"statList":[{"spend":3894,"msg":"获取xml内容"},{"spend":3535,"msg":"解释文章"},{"spend":698,"msg":"正文链接上传到cdn"},{"spend":1596,"msg":"上传封面图到cdn"},{"spend":1253,"msg":"修正封面图上传失败重新上传"}]},"extra5":5,"extra6":5,"extra7ImgCdnFailResultVector":[{"code":1,"isDone":false,"source":"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270654","sourceStatusCode":0,"sourceBytes":0,"destBytes":0,"feedId":84,"spendMs":14,"createdTime":"2020-08-08 20:16:19","host":"ancient-savannah-67875.herokuapp.com","referer":"https://toucharcade.com/?p=270654","sourceSize":"0","destSize":"0"},{"code":1,"isDone":false,"source":"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270644","sourceStatusCode":0,"sourceBytes":0,"destBytes":0,"feedId":84,"spendMs":10,"createdTime":"2020-08-08 20:16:20","host":"evening-sierra-62707.herokuapp.com","referer":"https://toucharcade.com/?p=270644","sourceSize":"0","destSize":"0"},{"code":1,"isDone":false,"source":"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270654","sourceStatusCode":0,"sourceBytes":0,"destBytes":0,"feedId":84,"spendMs":14,"createdTime":"2020-08-08 20:16:20","host":"ancient-temple-73187.herokuapp.com","referer":"https://toucharcade.com/?p=270654","sourceSize":"0","destSize":"0"},{"code":1,"isDone":false,"source":"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270644","sourceStatusCode":0,"sourceBytes":0,"destBytes":0,"feedId":84,"spendMs":17,"createdTime":"2020-08-08 20:16:20","host":"gentle-escarpment-75234.herokuapp.com","referer":"https://toucharcade.com/?p=270644","sourceSize":"0","destSize":"0"},{"code":1,"isDone":false,"source":"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270654","sourceStatusCode":0,"sourceBytes":0,"destBytes":0,"feedId":84,"spendMs":39,"createdTime":"2020-08-08 20:16:20","host":"hidden-journey-26361.herokuapp.com","referer":"https://toucharcade.com/?p=270654","sourceSize":"0","destSize":"0"},{"code":1,"isDone":false,"source":"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270644","sourceStatusCode":0,"sourceBytes":0,"destBytes":0,"feedId":84,"spendMs":44,"createdTime":"2020-08-08 20:16:20","host":"agile-badlands-29154.herokuapp.com","referer":"https://toucharcade.com/?p=270644","sourceSize":"0","destSize":"0"}]}
