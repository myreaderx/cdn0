How did critics feel about it at the time, and do we see it differently now? In this entry, Chris Coffel explores the original critical reception of John Carpenter&#8217;s Prince of Darkness.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>In October 1987, <strong>John Carpenter</strong> released the second installment of his &#8220;Apocalypse Trilogy&#8221;: <strong><em>Prince of Darkness</em></strong>. The film follows a quantum physicist professor and a group of his students as they research a mysterious cylinder containing a strange green liquid found in the basement of a monastery. <a href=\"https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl4268459521/weekly/?ref_=bo_rl_tab#tabs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">At the box office</a>, <em>Prince of Darkness</em> was a success, coming in second place over its opening weekend and bringing in just over $14 million (against a budget of $3 million) at the end of its eleven-week run. Critically speaking, however, the results were a bit more mixed.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It has too many holes,&#8221; <em>Los Angeles Times</em> critic <strong>Michael Wilmington</strong> <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1987-10-23-ca-10702-story.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">wrote in his middling review</a>. Wilmington was impressed with Carpenter&#8217;s direction, pointing to his &#8220;graceful, gliding tracking shots, and icily precise Hitchcockian setups&#8221; but felt the film got stuck in that weird space between serious and scary and goofy and camp.</p>\n<p><strong>Eleanor O&#8217;Sullivan</strong> of the <em>Asbury Park Press</em> echoed similar sentiments, albeit in a slightly harsher tone. O&#8217;Sullivan <a href=\"https://www.newspapers.com/clip/15426630/carpentermoviefullofgookprinceofd/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">wrote that the film</a> was &#8220;self-consciously camp and self-important but it&#8217;s so dopey, you can&#8217;t hate it or help laughing.&#8221; O&#8217;Sullivan also mocked various lines of dialogue and claimed the film would have put her to sleep if not for Carpenter&#8217;s &#8220;insistent, persistent and loud&#8221; score.</p>\n<p><strong>Vincent Canby</strong> of the <em>New York Times</em> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/23/movies/film-prince-of-darkness-by-john-carpenter.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">called the film</a> &#8220;surprisingly cheesy&#8221; when compared to Carpenter&#8217;s previous work. Much like O&#8217;Sullivan, Canby took issue with the film&#8217;s dialogue, writing that the film spends too much time on the science while being &#8220;stingy with the surprises.&#8221; As for the cast, Canby was less than impressed, calling <strong>Donald Pleasence</strong> and <strong>Victor Wong</strong> &#8220;windbags who could easily bore Satan into submission.&#8221; He did find <strong>Alice Cooper</strong> mild entertaining, however.</p>\n<p>&#8220;<em>Prince of Darkness</em> never should have seen the light of day,&#8221; <a href=\"https://www.newspapers.com/clip/15426576/princeofdarknessnevershouldhavesee/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">reads the headline</a> for <strong>Robert S. Cauthorn&#8217;s</strong> review in <em>The Arizona Daily Star</em>. Like many of his fellow critics, Cauthorn poked fun at the film&#8217;s dialogue, which he best summed up as different variations of &#8220;Oooo, I feel evil.&#8221; Though he wasn&#8217;t the only reviewer to refer to the film&#8217;s sinister cylinder as a lava lamp, he leaned into much more than anyone else, calling it such at seven different points in his review. It&#8217;s safe to say Cauthorn wasn&#8217;t a fan of the film, calling it a &#8220;stinkerooney,&#8221; but he was eager to see the sequel, &#8220;Prince of Darkness II: Cramming for Final Exams.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In the years since its release, the analysis of the film has been much more positive. When Carpenter&#8217;s twenty feature films are ranked &#8212; and they&#8217;re ranked often &#8212; <em>Prince of Darkness</em> regularly appears in the top half. Here at FSR, we <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/john-carpenter-movies-ranked/2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">placed the film</a> in ninth place, with Jacob Trussell calling it Carpenter&#8217;s &#8220;most criminally underrated&#8221; film. <em>Slashfilm</em> <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/john-carpenter-movies-ranked/2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">has the film</a> ranked seventh, while <em>Collider</em> puts it in <a href=\"https://collider.com/john-carpenter-movies-ranked/#prince-of-darkness\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Carpenter&#8217;s top five</a>.</p>\n<p>In an excellent 2016 piece for <em>Little White Lies</em>, <strong>Tom Watchorn</strong> <a href=\"https://lwlies.com/articles/prince-of-darkness-john-carpenter-best-film/\">writes that</a> <em>Prince of Darkness</em> is &#8220;among the most haunting&#8221; of Carpenter films but gets lost in the shuffle because it was released between two beloved cult classics: <em>Big Trouble in Little China</em> and <em>They Live</em>. Watchorn credits Carpenter&#8217;s ability to deliver power imagery as to why the film works so well, writing that the director &#8220;unrepentantly goes tactile and visceral in a manner only rivaled by <em>The Thing</em>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Writing for io9.com that same year, <strong>Cheryl Eddy</strong> <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/john-carpenters-prince-of-darkness-contains-one-of-the-1762704953\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">acknowledges the film</a> is &#8220;riddled with gaping plot holes&#8221; but that doesn&#8217;t stop it from depicting &#8220;evil in one of the most repulsive and scary ways ever.&#8221; Eddy writes that some of the plot points are confusing and the acting leaves a bit to be desired, but if you can get past that, you&#8217;re left with &#8220;highly effective nightmare fodder, with a bonus side of skin-crawling repulsion.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In a 2019 column for <em>Bloody Disgusting</em>, <strong>Meagan Navarro</strong> <a href=\"https://bloody-disgusting.com/editorials/3592348/came-80s-devil-liquid-prince-darkness/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">attributes the best moments</a> of <em>Prince of Darkness</em> to Carpenter and crew being forced to get creative due to a limited budget. The film&#8217;s most memorable moment comes in the climax with a mangled hand reaching into a mirror and pulling the evil out and into the real world. &#8220;Carpenter and crew ingeniously drained their camera crane of its mercury,&#8221; Navarro writes, &#8220;and put it in a container. It gave the effect of liquid mirror glass. The arms in this shot are prosthetics.&#8221; Navarro also suggests that the film slipped by many because of its &#8220;ideas and surrealism,&#8221; but credits those same reasons as proof that Carpenter isn&#8217;t &#8220;afraid to go full throttle on his vision.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The writer known by the moniker The Wolfman, of the website The Wolfman Cometh, believes <em>Prince of Darkness</em> works so well by not being your typical John Carpenter film. &#8220;The way that real science was used along with the supernatural made it feel much more like it was based on a story by H.P. Lovecraft,&#8221; <a href=\"https://thewolfmancometh.com/2010/11/03/prince-of-darkness-1987/\">The Wolfman writes in a 2010 review</a>. &#8220;And I mean that in the best way possible.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This is the third time one of Carpenter&#8217;s films has appeared in this column. I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s an indictment on him by any means, but it does suggest that his films can require repeat viewings before they catch on. Or perhaps it means Carpenter is often ahead of the curve and viewers aren&#8217;t ready for his films on their initial release. With regards to <em>Prince of Darkness</em>, I can say I&#8217;ve shared similar thoughts to nearly every review mentioned here, negative and positive, at one time or another.</p>\n<p>The first few times I watched the film, I was left disappointed. I felt like Carpenter presented all these big ideas but then didn&#8217;t manage to do anything with them. The film is called <em>Prince of Darkness</em>, but we never actually see the Prince released to wreak havoc upon the world. I walked away thinking this was a huge missed opportunity.</p>\n<p>Over the years my opinion has completely flipped. <em>Prince of Darkness</em> isn&#8217;t Carpenter&#8217;s best film, but with regards to humanity, it may very well be his most chilling. The movie implies that there is a powerful evil out there &#8212; in this case, an Anti-God &#8212; that&#8217;s just waiting to strike, and there&#8217;s no way for anyone to escape. Even with the science to battle it, you&#8217;re up against an unbeatable foe. And at that point, the only thing left is your faith.</p>\n<p>The movie is pure nightmare fodder, just as Eddy described it. Nothing exemplifies this more than the dream sequences, which we learn to be transmissions from the future. Carpenter shot these on video, played them on a television set, and then recorded them off that. The effect works brilliantly, creating eerie visions that are sure to make the hairs on the back of your neck stand up.</p>\n<p>With <em>Prince of Darkness</em>, there are two morals we can take away. The first is that we&#8217;re all boned because, in the end, evil will always win. The second is to not question John Carpenter. His films may not work on the first viewing or the second or the third, but eventually, we all realize he was right all along.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/fl4J67Kjhn0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 07 Oct 2020 11:16:19 +0000","feedId":24,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"78cc44ba6b3c5b5842ea64d064ddfedf","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Chris Coffel","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/fl4J67Kjhn0":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn47@2020_5/2020/10/09/03-33-22-307_7ac656fde68f161a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602214364663},{"createdTime":"2020-10-09 11:32:44","updatedTime":"2020-10-09 11:32:44","title":"Film Fests Unite for the Epic and Necessary Nightstream","link":"https://filmschoolrejects.com/?p=358155","description":"<p>Some of you aren&#8217;t old enough to remember this, but the world used to enjoy the annual presence of something called &#8220;film festivals.&#8221; People would gather from near and far to share and watch new movies together in the film-lover&#8217;s church &#8212; we called them theaters. All film fests brought joy, but for some of us, there was a special thrill to be found in genre fests big and small, from Fantasia in Montreal to Chattanooga in Tennesee. Recent events have forced film festivals to get creative, and while a few moved their celebration online as individual recreations, a few others have had a different idea. <a href=\"https://nightstream.eventive.org/welcome\"><strong>Nightstream</strong></a> is an online film festival combining five separate fests under one virtual roof, and it runs October 8th through the 11th.</p>\n<p>The five fests &#8212; <a href=\"https://bostonunderground.org/\">Boston Underground</a>, <a href=\"https://brooklynhorrorfest.com/\">Brooklyn Horror</a>, <a href=\"https://northbendfilmfest.com/\">North Bend</a>, <a href=\"https://www.overlookfilmfest.com/\">Overlook</a>, and <a href=\"https://popcornfrights.com/\">Popcorn Frights</a> &#8212; have come together to create a single experience of films, events, live Q&#38;As, shorts, and more, and their schedule is absolutely packed. The complete list of films playing Nightstream is below, but first I want to shout out some highlights including some of the non-movie events and experiences.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re looking forward to quite a few of the fest&#8217;s films starting with the world premiere of <strong><em>Run</em></strong>, the new film from the director of <em>Searching</em> (2018), which stars Sarah Paulson as a woman with an increasingly suspicious teenage daughter. The closing night movie is <strong><em>Mandibles</em></strong>, the latest from <em>Rubber</em> (2010) director Quentin Dupieux, which somehow involves the very timely presence of a giant fly. <strong><em>Boys from County Hell</em></strong> is the latest from the director of the excellent <em>Bad Day for the Cut</em> (2017) and pits some unfortunate folks against an Irish vampire. Ryuhei Kitamura (<em>The Midnight Meat Train</em>, 2008) returns with the Ruby Rose-led thriller <strong><em>The Doorman</em></strong>. Timo Tjahjanto delivers a sequel to his own horrifying hit with <strong><em>May the Devil Take You Too</em></strong>, and his former partner in crime, Kimo Stamboel unleashes an unnatural nightmare with <strong><em>The Queen of Black Magic</em></strong>.</p>\n<p>Other standouts that we&#8217;ve already seen and love include <strong><em>Black Bear</em></strong> which offers up a strange cabin in the woods scenario unlike any other and the dreamy nightmare that is <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/come-true-review/\"><strong><em>Come True</em></strong></a>. Brea Grant&#8217;s <strong><em>Lucky</em></strong> is extremely on the nose but still delivers a compelling and thrilling peek into the daily life of women everywhere, and <strong><em>Jumbo</em></strong> offers up a strange, beautiful, and sensual look at a highly unlikely romance.</p>\n<p>Nightstream is more than just movies as evident by the abundance of live interviews, podcasts, and events they have planned as well. The annual Masters of Horrror dinner which gathers legendary filmmakers for food and talk will be broadcast for the first time, genre talents from Elijah Wood to Barbara Crampton will host a social hour with creepy cocktail recipes, the always fun Final Exam horror trivia will return with hosts Ted Geoghegan and Michael Gingold, the always exuberant Peaches Christ will host a virtual Horror Homecoming get together, and there will also be a game show with Paul Scheer &#8212; because why not!</p>\n<p>In an ideal world we&#8217;d have these five genre fests &#8212; and the many, many others out there &#8212; to actually attend and enjoy this year. For now, though, Nightstream might just be the best option available. It&#8217;s a big undertaking coordinated by numerous film lovers (including some very special behind-the-scenes talents who rarely get the attention they deserve), and it absolutely deserves your love. We&#8217;re starting our fest with the opening night film, <em>Run</em>, and we hope to see you there.</p>\n<h2>Complete List of Feature Films Playing Nightstream</h2>\n\n<table id=\"tablepress-26\" class=\"tablepress tablepress-id-26\">\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"row-1 odd\">\n\t<th class=\"column-1\">Movie Title</th><th class=\"column-2\">Screening Date(s)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody class=\"row-hover\">\n<tr class=\"row-2 even\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\">32 Malasana Street</td><td class=\"column-2\">10/9, 10/10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"row-3 odd\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\">Anything for Jackson</td><td class=\"column-2\">10/9</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"row-4 even\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\">AV: The Hunt</td><td class=\"column-2\">10/10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"row-5 odd\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\">Black Bear</td><td class=\"column-2\">10/11</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"row-6 even\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\">Bleed With Me</td><td class=\"column-2\">10/11</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"row-7 odd\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\">Bloody Hell</td><td class=\"column-2\">10/9</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"row-8 even\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\">Boys From County Hell</td><td class=\"column-2\">10/10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"row-9 odd\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\">Breaking Surface</td><td class=\"column-2\">10/11</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"row-10 even\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\">Climate of the Hunter</td><td class=\"column-2\">10/11</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"row-11 odd\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\">Come True</td><td class=\"column-2\">10/9</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"row-12 even\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\">Darkness</td><td class=\"column-2\">10/10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"row-13 odd\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\">Detention</td><td class=\"column-2\">10/8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"row-14 even\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\">Dinner in America</td><td class=\"column-2\">10/10, 10/11</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"row-15 odd\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\">The Doorman</td><td class=\"column-2\">10/8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"row-16 even\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\">Ema</td><td class=\"column-2\">10/8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"row-17 odd\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\">Frank &#38;

This article on the best horror ending scenes is part of our ongoing series <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/topics/31-days-of-horror-lists/\"><strong>31 Days of Horror Lists</strong></a>.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>We expect to be scared during horror movies. However, sometimes filmmakers decide to throw something at us once we think the scares are all over, resulting in a nasty little shock that is both impressive and unfair. The last-minute scare is a trope by now and can sometimes be poorly executed or just plain nonsensical, but it’s still easy to get caught off guard by films that do it well. After all, once the kid is saved (or killed) and the monster is killed (or escapes), and a sense of normalcy is restored, it’s only natural for us to relax a little bit. And then &#8212; wha-bam! &#8212; the film hits us with one last jolt.

Still, that doesn’t make it any less terrifying when Carrie White’s bloodied, grabbing hand bursts out of her grave just before the credits roll. <strong>Brian De Palma</strong>’s final scare is one of the most iconic last-minute freak-outs in horror history, and it works because it sets up a somber tone &#8212; Sue setting flowers atop the wreckage of Carrie’s home &#8212; and then demolishes it with a jarring reminder that Sue’s survivor&#8217;s guilt will haunt her forever.

Sure, the first one did, but they wouldn’t just recycle that ending again, would they? Oh, would they ever, but what <em>Final Destination 2 </em>does that is so unique is to go for a capper that winks at the series’ future turn into blood-red camp than a more straightforward “gotcha!” moment. Rather than Death catching up to our surviving leads, A.J. Cook and Michael Landes, it takes a detour and offs an ancillary character in a barbecue accident. As the survivors get ready for <a href=\"https://youtu.be/8fLf0C36L2k\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">an outdoor dinner with the boy&#8217;s family</a>, he explodes in the background, his scorched, bloodied arm flying through the air, perfectly plopping onto a picnic table in front of his screaming mother before cutting to black. It’s as bizarre as it is unexpected, but ultimately it’s meant to make you laugh through its sudden and senseless brutality, just like a <em>Looney Tunes</em> cartoon. This zaniness is the key element to why the <em>Final Destination</em> franchise has an ardent following almost a decade after the last film was released. (Jacob Trussell)</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>8. Rosemary&#8217;s Baby (1968)</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-357878 size-full\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Rosemarys-Baby-Ending.jpg\" alt=\"Rosemary's Baby horror Ending\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Rosemarys-Baby-Ending.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Rosemarys-Baby-Ending-768x576.jpg 768w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Rosemarys-Baby-Ending-160x120.jpg 160w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Rosemarys-Baby-Ending-320x240.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p>“What have you done to its eyes?” Mia Farrow’s cries at the end of <em>Rosemary’s Baby</em> are impossible to forget, but the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/P10AWBi4-y8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">scene’s conclusion</a>, in which she accepts her satanic son, might be even scarier. <em>Rosemary’s Baby</em> unfolds like a psychological thriller, but in a whirlwind final sequence, viewers realize that it was actually an all-out battle for the fate of the world playing out in Rosemary’s womb. It turns out the new mother lost in a game that was rigged from the start, but the cult members who surround her at the film&#8217;s end present her antichrist child like a special gift to her. Rosemary drops the knife she had been clinging to, all the fight leaving her, and when she finally approaches the black-clad cradle with the love of a mother in her eyes, it’s a bone-chilling inversion of our expectations.

Don&#8217;t Look Now (1973)</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-357879 size-full\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Dont-Look-Now.jpg\" alt=\"Don't Look Now horror ending\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Dont-Look-Now.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Dont-Look-Now-768x576.jpg 768w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Dont-Look-Now-160x120.jpg 160w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Dont-Look-Now-320x240.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p>There are few climaxes I&#8217;ve felt as visceral a reaction toward as the one that attacks you in <em>Don&#8217;t Look Now</em>. Grief is a poison. The loss of a loved one can infect the soul, spreading venom from your heart to those around you. How can you stunt its growth? I&#8217;m not sure. Thankfully, I&#8217;ve never experienced pain as intensely as the one bestowed upon Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie in <em>Don&#8217;t Look Now</em>. Their two characters try to lose their pain in the buildings and passageways of Venice, but wherever Sutherland&#8217;s father character turns, he sees his dead little girl prancing away from him. When he finally corners her in a dark building one night, the little girl turns, and well, it&#8217;s not a little girl. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/6C-Y3oX5PyQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">It&#8217;s a horror of another order</a>. The first time I met Sutherland&#8217;s end in this movie, I was confused and angry. What the hell? I don&#8217;t get it. The more I watch the film, however, the more sincere a shock the final slice of razor becomes. I have not felt his character&#8217;s pain, but I imagine it to be something akin to this final scare.

[REC] (2007)</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-357880\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Rec.jpg\" alt=\"Rec\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Rec.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Rec-768x576.jpg 768w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Rec-160x120.jpg 160w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Rec-320x240.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p><em>[Rec]</em> is a cruel movie that offers no respite from the terror until the end credits roll. It’s one of the most immersive and claustrophobic movies ever made, and it’s one of the few that’s truly enhanced by the found footage format. You really get the sense of being stuck inside the nightmare with the quarantined reports. The ending is a doozy, too. Angela (Manuela Velasco) spots a zombie and tries to hide, but there’s nowhere to escape. She is then <a href=\"https://youtu.be/BrmpbVPTDCw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">dragged into the darkness</a> and her fate is unknown until the sequel. The visual is unforgettable, and it’s a final kicker in what is an exhilarating and bleak experience overall.

Don&#8217;t get me wrong, there are a lot of Bigfoot movies out there, particularly of the horror variety, but the bulk of them aren&#8217;t all that well made. Worse, even the ones that are legitimately entertaining are too often dismissed by genre fans.</p>\n<p>That dismissal of Sasquatch&#8217;s cinematic offerings extends even to the Boo Crew as some members &#8212; I won&#8217;t name names &#8212; have watched far too few Bigfoot movies and like even fewer.

Return to Boggy Creek (1977)</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-358051\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/return-to-boggy-creek.jpg\" alt=\"Return To Boggy Creek\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/return-to-boggy-creek.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/return-to-boggy-creek-768x576.jpg 768w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/return-to-boggy-creek-160x120.jpg 160w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/return-to-boggy-creek-320x240.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p>Bigfoot horror movies are already a subgenre unto themselves, but there are various sub-subgenres as well. One that we don&#8217;t really see much of these days is the folk-tale style that treats the legend as true and the locals as believers. This follow-up to 1972&#8217;s monster hit <em>The Legend of Boggy Creek</em> keeps the same tone and style to deliver a suspenseful tale of Bigfoot creeping out the populace and audiences alike. It&#8217;s low-key compared to most other Bigfoot movies, but it features some effective sequences of tension and terror alongside appearances by TV&#8217;s Dawn Wells and Dana Plato. It won&#8217;t knock your socks off, but consider it a gateway horror movie for kids who like <em>Harry and the Hendersons </em>because the beast, while spooky, also saves some kids from bad weather!

Creature from Black Lake (1976)</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-358061\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/creature-from-black-lake.jpg\" alt=\"Creature From Black Lake\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/creature-from-black-lake.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/creature-from-black-lake-768x576.jpg 768w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/creature-from-black-lake-160x120.jpg 160w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/creature-from-black-lake-320x240.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p>A mysterious creature is stalking the swamps of Louisiana. This prompts two city-slicker college students to travel down south and investigate the murders. They have a difficult time getting the locals to talk about the Sasquatch, but it doesn’t take long until the legendary monster finds <em>them</em>. While the movie could use more shots of the monster, <em>Creature from Black Lake</em> is a gem that’s elevated by some likable characters and an abundance of charm. The film also has a spooky atmosphere that really captures the mood of the swamp, which is its strongest quality overall. (Kieran Fisher)</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>8. The Capture of Bigfoot (1979)</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-358060\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/the-capture-of-bigfoot.jpg\" alt=\"The Capture Of Bigfoot\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/the-capture-of-bigfoot.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/the-capture-of-bigfoot-768x576.jpg 768w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/the-capture-of-bigfoot-160x120.jpg 160w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/the-capture-of-bigfoot-320x240.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p>As they say in <em>The X-Files</em>, I want to believe. The hairy missing link is out there, somewhere. With my fingers and toes crossed, I watch every Bigfoot movie caught in desperate hope. This is a flick that will keep the spark of imagination and wish-fulfillment lit within. <em>The Capture of Bigfoot</em> is not a good movie, but its director, <strong>Bill Rebane</strong>, is a believer. His desperate desire seeps from every blurry inch of this flick, and the dream of the apeman is kept alive. Sure, Lloyd Kaufman considers this to be one of the worst films his Troma Entertainment ever distributed, and that might be true, but <em>The Capture of Bigfoot</em> is a damned earnest experience, and for fans of this glorious subgenre, it happily flames our belief. The truth is out there, struttin’ through the woods at this very moment. (Brad Gullickson)</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>7. Primal Rage (2017)</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-358058\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/primal-rage.jpg\" alt=\"Primal Rage\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/primal-rage.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/primal-rage-768x576.jpg 768w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/primal-rage-160x120.jpg 160w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/primal-rage-320x240.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p>If you’re reading this list, I’m willing to bet you have more than a passing interest in Bigfoot horror movies. That means you’ll probably enjoy <em>Primal Rage</em>, which follows a married couple road-tripping through the Pacific Northwest when they’re unexpectedly sidelined by a ‘squatch encounter. The film is the directorial debut of special effects artist <strong>Patrick Magee</strong>, whose skill has been on display in films such as <em>Alien vs. Predator</em> and <em>Spider-Man</em>. As one might expect, the special effects, creature design, and makeup are the film’s strong suits. Beyond that, well, results may vary, but this is certainly a film for seasoned Sasquatch fans. Everyone else, consider this your warning. (Anna Swanson)</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>6. Demonwarp (1988)</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-358057\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/demonwarp.jpg\" alt=\"Demonwarp\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/demonwarp.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/demonwarp-768x576.jpg 768w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/demonwarp-160x120.jpg 160w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/demonwarp-320x240.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p>What if I told you there was a film in which Oscar winner <strong>George Kennedy</strong> attempts to track down Bigfoot only to have the creature sneak up behind him and smash his head into a rock? And what if the Bigfoot in question was more of a werefoot with a knack for stealing electronics? If that sounds confusing, don’t worry because the movie also contains aliens and one zombie-like being that does a wicked Jack Nicholson impression. Oh, and religion seems to be pulling all the strings. Obviously, I’m talking about <em>Demonwarp</em>, and it’s even better than it sounds.

Today, we&#8217;re watching a video that explores the early filmography of horror director Joe Dante.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>If you wanted to make a film about the Hollywood horror scene in the early 1980s, you couldn&#8217;t pick a more fruitful subject than <strong>Joe Dante</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The man&#8217;s early career plays like a <em>Forrest Gump</em>-style who&#8217;s who of genre film: from a pivotal internship with low budget legend <strong>Roger Corman</strong> to multiple stints with Rick Baker&#8217;s protégée, <strong>Rob Bottin</strong>, to a fatefully friendly partnership with <strong>Steven Spielberg</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Dante&#8217;s early films also speak to a tonal truth that not only <em>feels </em>characteristically early-&#8217;80s but also defines the gait and appeal of Dante&#8217;s later filmography. Namely: a gift for balancing the frightening and the fun.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>From the get-go, Dante was never pretentious when it came to reveling in B-pictures. Like his contemporary Sam Raimi, Dante had a knack for lacing genuine genre beats with a lighter touch. So, for instance, when <em><strong>Piranha</strong></em>&#8216;s genetically engineered monstrosities gnaw a swimmer&#8217;s legs down to the bone, it&#8217;s as much a gorefest as it is a live-action <em>Looney Tunes</em> gag.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a more in-depth introduction to Dante&#8217;s pre-<em><strong>Gremlins</strong></em> career, we recommend a peek at the following video essay, which covers Dante&#8217;s output from the copyright nightmare of <em><strong>Movie Orgy</strong> </em>to his ghoulish contribution to <em><strong>Twilight Zone: The Movie</strong></em>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-55ed506f-f36b-4bc3-86c3-db97d4f03d15\">Watch &#8220;<strong>The Early Films Of Joe Dante &#8211; <em>Piranha</em>,<em> The Howling</em> &#38; More!</strong>&#8220;:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"The Early Films Of Joe Dante - Piranha, The Howling &#38; More!\" width=\"700\" height=\"394\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pyh6e1Z3mww?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"block-204634e5-f7df-4d01-8d9c-306f67d5d3ae\">Who made this?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-6dbcfd19-2673-4e0f-b0e4-e6e8b948b03e\"><strong>Andrew J.

If they&#8217;re for you, they&#8217;re for you regardless of what Rotten Tomatoes might say. <em>Deuce Bigelow: Male Gigolo</em> (1999), <em>Little Nicky</em> (2000), <em>Zookeeper</em> (2011), <em>Jack and Jill</em> (2011),<em> The Ridiculous 6</em> (2015) &#8212; with more than forty films produced so far, the company has made its comedic mandate clear with a reliance on crass jokes, pratfalls, mean-spirited abuse, and endings that deliver overly simplistic morals. They aren&#8217;t high art and never try to be, and there are even a handful of exceptions with legitimately entertaining and well-crafted films like <em>Murder Mystery</em> (2019) and <em>The House Bunny</em> (2008). Most importantly, they know their audiences and those audiences know (and love) them resulting in a fruitful relationship in both directions.</p>\n<p><em><strong> Hubie Halloween</strong></em> is the forty-fourth Happy Madison film, and while it&#8217;s arguably once again little more than a paid vacation for Sandler and his usual cohorts, it at least has the distinction of not being egregiously offensive to the concept of humor. It&#8217;s a simple, silly, star-filled ode to Halloween and the importance of kindness, and it being fairly unfunny and highly unconvincing with that message won&#8217;t matter at all to the Sandler faithful.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s Halloween time, and once again the small town of Salem, MA prepares for the biggest night of the year. Tourist dollars flow in, and Hubie Dubois (Sandler) rides the streets working to keep everyone safe despite no one giving him the time of day. Kids throw things at him as he pedals his bike &#8212; the gag grows throughout the film as innocuous foods are swapped out for flaming spears and sharp objects &#8212; and adults are no less merciless. Mr. Landolfa (<strong>Ray Liotta</strong>) calls him Pubie, and soon almost everyone&#8217;s joining in. The only exceptions are Hubie&#8217;s unnamed mom (<strong>June Squibb</strong>) and his childhood crush, Violet (<strong>Julie Bowen</strong>). Things take a turn, though, when townspeople start disappearing as someone, or some thing, hunts them in the night.</p>\n<p>Is it the recently escaped lunatic (<strong>Rob Schneider</strong>)? The strange new neighbor (<strong>Steve Buscemi</strong>) with mysteriously hairy arms and an aversion to the full moon? The answer is actually almost immediately obvious despite a script by Sandler and <strong>Tim Herlihy</strong> (<em>Billy Madison</em>, 1995; <em>Pixels</em>, 2015) that tries in vain to misdirect viewers, but suspense is never really the game here anyway. <em>Hubie Halloween</em> is a comedy for folks already laughing at <strong>Kevin James</strong>&#8216; hair in the picture above or the thought of <strong>George Wallace</strong> riffing on <em>Jaws</em> (1975) as the town&#8217;s panic-averse mayor.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also, unfortunately, for viewers who think &#8220;hot&#8221; women should immediately succumb to male kindness despite the absence of any other positive value. Hubie&#8217;s broke, lives with his mom, can barely navigate his daily life, and yet Violet still bends over backwards to lock him down &#8212; seriously, there&#8217;s a cringe-worthy scene towards the end that will leave you feeling terribly for Bowen. Violet&#8217;s son, Tommy (<strong>Noah Schnapp</strong>, <em>Stranger Things</em>), meets a girl (<strong>Paris Berelc</strong>) who&#8217;s well out of his league, a few years older, super cool, and yet she&#8217;s instantaneously eager to be his girlfriend. It&#8217;s shallow nonsense, but it&#8217;s well in league with the Happy Madison formula.</p>\n<p>That lazy, one-note wish fulfillment continues with the film&#8217;s main theme regarding kindness. If you expect the entire town to learn the value of being nice and accepting Hubie as he is, well, congrats, you too could have written <em>Hubie Halloween</em>. It&#8217;s never convincing and instead feels like nothing more than the flipping of a switch, but this isn&#8217;t a film interested in selling itself as anything more than a harmless diversion from everyday life.</p>\n<p>Performances are as expected with everyone channeling their expected personas and quirks &#8212; Sandler&#8217;s voice choice is occasionally difficult to understand, but you&#8217;re not missing much. <strong>Maya Rudolph</strong>, <strong>Tim Meadows</strong>, <strong>Kenan Thompson</strong>, <strong>Michael Chiklis</strong>, and others pop in for their respective shticks. It&#8217;s an arguably unfunny film, but comedy being subjective means tastes will vary, so yes, Squibb&#8217;s rotating tee-shirt slogans amuse and there&#8217;s a fun gag involving Harley Quinn. Director <strong>Steven Brill</strong>, who started his career with the goofy yet inspirational <em>Heavyweights</em> (1995), has since become a go-to workhorse for Sandler with this being their fifth outing as director and star. He captures some of the mayhem with an energetic eye and isn&#8217;t against the occasional horror genre homage, but it&#8217;s ultimately a thankless gig.</p>\n<p><em>Hubie Halloween</em> is, at the end of the day the lightest of lightweight Sandler films. It&#8217;s also a reminder that as invested and memorable as he is in something like <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/topics/uncut-gems/\"><em>Uncut Gems</em></a> (2019), he&#8217;s always ready to slide back into the silliness that pays the bills. Fans will enjoy the treat, and youngsters getting into horror will have some brainless fun too &#8212; it may not be ideal, but if a movie makes people happy it&#8217;s disingenuous to call it a bad thing.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/7970CI2pN7k\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 08 Oct 2020 23:38:24 +0000","feedId":24,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"d686dfbc1454579b04279d7d80130227","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Rob Hunter","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/7970CI2pN7k":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn64@2020_3/2020/10/09/03-33-22-215_8835e18ff4c1d94b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602214364662},{"createdTime":"2020-10-09 11:32:44","updatedTime":"2020-10-09 11:32:44","title":"The Sumptuous Sound Design of Pedro Almodóvar","link":"https://filmschoolrejects.com/?p=358016","description":"\n<p><em>Welcome to <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/topics/the-queue/\"><strong>The Queue</strong></a> — your daily distraction of curated video content sourced from across the web. Today, we&#8217;re watching a video that explores the sound design of Pedro Almodovar movies.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>The films of Spanish auteur <strong>Pedro Almodóvar</strong> are the dictionary definition of sensual. And while, unfortunately, we can only experience the medium of film with two of our available senses, rest assured that if more sensory modes of experience were available to cinema-goers, Almodóvar would almost certainly exploit them. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And yet, armed with sight and sound, Almodóvar crafts worlds, scenarios, and moments that might as well be tactile. He conjures visual feasts replete with vividity, patterns, and palettes. Spectacles of scarlet, lime, paisley, and plum. Even when he made a horror film that one time (the extraordinary <em><strong>The Skin I Live In</strong></em>) he couldn&#8217;t help but flirt with tiger print.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Almodóvar is also a master of sound design, a vital cinematic ingredient whose impact often goes underappreciated because, unlike images, it is not right in front of your face. It is impossible to screengrab the effervescence of a champagne pop, the satisfying slice of a reluctant tomato, or the inimitable crinkle of tin foil. From the rude, boisterous films of his post-Franco youth to the meditative confessional turn of his later pictures, Almodóvar has never held back, and that applies to sound as much as anything else. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sound is front and center in Almodóvar&#8217;s work. And for a greater appreciation of what I&#8217;m talking about, and for the auditory equivalent of merlot on a sunny back porch, here&#8217;s a montage that encourages us to <em>hear </em>Almodóvar:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Watch &#8220;<strong>Hearing Pedro Almodóvar – A Lesson in Sound Design</strong>&#8220;:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Hearing Pedro Almodóvar – A Lesson in Sound Design\" width=\"700\" height=\"394\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LxMcLlxv4ZM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Who made this?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This video comes courtesy of the fine folks over at <em><strong>Little White</strong> <strong>Lies</strong></em>, a film-obsessed magazine based in the United Kingdom.

This time, we&#8217;re recommending Evil, the TV show you won&#8217;t believe began on CBS.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s a reason you may not have heard about the procedural horror drama <em><strong>Evil </strong></em>before it made its way to Netflix this month. Blame it on marketing or that it got lost in the neverending stream of new content, but the most likely culprit is that <em>Evil</em> originated on CBS. If you’re like me, you don’t expect to find a worthy successor to <strong><em>Hannibal</em> </strong>on the network that airs <em>Young Sheldon</em> and <em>J.A.G.</em>, but that’s just what I’m here to tell you. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Michelle King</strong> and <strong>Robert King</strong>, creators of idiosyncratic lawyer-rom-dram <em><strong>The Good Wife</strong></em>, have developed a show that shares the same dark, cerebral, and ridiculously weird sensibility that we came to crave in <strong>Bryan Fuller</strong>’s reimagining of Hannibal Lecter on NBC. They may have added an extra layer of endearing cheesiness, but <em>Evil</em> is just as bold in pushing the envelope of what can be seen and said on network television, and that’s a huge part of what makes it a must-see. You’re just categorically not expecting all of the extremely bizarre places it’s willing to go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before I go further, I do want to say that getting you hyped about <em>Evil</em> means telling you about <em>Evil</em>, which inherently comes with minor spoilers. I’ll keep everything vague and out of context so nothing ruins your experience, but I want you to get a little taste of what the show has to offer to inspire you to add it to your queue. Believe me: you&#8217;re going to want to see this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Evil </em>follows forensic psychologist Kristen Bouchard (<strong>Katja Herbers</strong>), a professional skeptic who assists the District Attorney’s Office of Queens, New York, in assessing the mental acuity of criminals on trial. After an incident involving a convicted murderer claiming to be demonically possessed, Kristen is contacted by a different kind of assessor, David Acosta (<strong>Mike Colter</strong>), a priest-in-training who works for the Catholic Church in determining whether or not a case of possession is real. He wants a questioning, psychological eye for his assessments, as he believes science, as much as superstition, can be responsible for religious phenomena. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alongside David’s technical expert, Ben Shakir (<strong>Aasif Mandvi</strong>), another skeptic who looks for a natural explanation to the supernatural, the trio encounter everything from ghosts and demons to miracles and prophecies, as well as confronting real-world terrors like Leland Townsend (<strong>Michael Emerson</strong>), a Mephistophelean psychologist who has a preternatural talent for encouraging the absolute worst in everyone he meets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Kings <a href=\"https://www.thewrap.com/evil-creators-robert-king-michelle-king-debate/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">say their intention</a> was to create a show “where you could look at present-day phenomenon and you could interpret it scientifically and supernaturally.&#8221; <em>Evil</em> is a procedural, after all, so the Kings use Kristen, David, and Ben’s different viewpoints on the unexplainable to give the audience all the puzzle pieces they need to solve these monster-of-the-week mysteries. Is a Broadway producer being driven mad by the voice of Satan, or is it really just a hacker who has tapped into his Alexa and is terrorizing him over a loudspeaker? While the show may offer answers, it always manages to leave the door open for you to make up your own mind.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The show&#8217;s most chilling moments, though, come from the creators contrasting supernatural phenomena, like resurrection and demonic possession, with the evils that people encounter every day, from systemic racism (“177 Minutes”) to militant misogyny (“Exorcism Part 2”). Hearing possessed women describing ritual murder is creepy, but listening to incels reading their vile internet comments out loud is utterly terrifying. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In spite of how dark the show can be, the creators wanted <em>Evil</em> to also be filled with “things that scare you and then make you laugh afterward,” which speaks to the inherent fun the show has throughout the first season (CBS has renewed <em>Evil</em> for a second, by the way). All of its transgressive themes are balanced out by delightfully self-aware cheesiness. It’s the kind of show that&#8217;ll have an honest conversation about abuse in the Catholic Church before telling you its lead character lives under a bridge ominously named the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell_Gate_Bridge\" target=\"_blank\">Hell Gate</a>. That&#8217;s so on the nose, how can you not inwardly smile at the unsubtle wink towards the macabre?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This cheesiness is also paramount to some of the show’s best villains, like the augmented reality entity Rose390 and George, the dream demon that Kristen meets in “Genesis 1.” Created by Academy Award-winning makeup designer Joel Harlow, George is the textbook definition of a ghoul, with sharp teeth and glowing eyes. But rather than being a run-of-the-mill monster, George has a sharp tongue to humorously terrorize and taunt Kristen with, almost like a network television version of Freddy Krueger cracking wise. He even shares a love for <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://youtu.be/HcrTqof683A?t=52\" target=\"_blank\">cutting off fingers</a> with fiendish glee, except in George’s case the digits are off of our horrified protag:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"EVIL - True or False?\" width=\"700\" height=\"394\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/34jvxw2Ki64?start=119&#038;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Michael Emerson</strong>’s Dr. Leland Townsend masterfully balances the humor and horror of the show. Similar to his character Benjamin Linus on <em>Lost</em>, he’s the kind of villain you love to hate. Leland may be turning disaffected young men into incels and using desperate YouTube influencers to coerce teens into stabbing pencils into their ears, but Emerson plays his acerbic wit with such weaselly aplomb that you can’t help being charmed even as he makes light of murdering kids. We’re not quite sure if Leland is a hapless insurance adjuster taken over by some omniscient demonic force, or a Faustian fool who sold his soul to Baphomet for the powers of toxic persuasion, but regardless he&#8217;s already become the linchpin that ties the show’s dueling tones together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though the show&#8217;s humor allows for episodes that can have a cartoonishly evil cat give characters the stink eye, it still doesn’t diminish all the bleak places it goes. Over the course of the first season of <em>Evil</em>, we get parents wanting to kill their children, children trying to murder babies, and the spirits of dead kids trying to bury other kids alive. We watch hospital patients get ritually abused by nurses while others are plagued by visions of hellish monsters straight out of a Tool music video. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the eighth episode, “2 Fathers,” Kristen wanders into the middle of a field in a hallucinatory haze following the screams of a woman (Nana Mensah) in labor. When she gets to a clearing, Kristen finds her giving birth to <em>something</em> that she pushes out in an embryonic sac. When the woman tears open that sac with her teeth, it reveals genuinely the craziest looking creature I’ve ever seen on network television.

This week, <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/author/valerie/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Valerie Ettenhofer</a> takes a look at the second entry to Mike Flanagan&#8217;s &#8220;Haunting&#8221; horror anthology series for Netflix: The Haunting of Bly Manor.</em></p>\n<p>What is it with detailed miniature replicas of houses in horror? The intricate, custom-made props are having a pop-cultural moment, from the dioramas of <em>Hereditary</em> to the teeth-lined plaything of <em>Sharp Objects</em> to <em>The Lodge</em>’s sinister dollhouse. Their broad appeal as a narrative device is understandable: they gesture at the idea of fate’s mystery, the figures within set up in meaningful or ominous positions. Yet the metaphor, already thin, cheapens with each use. In <strong>Mike Flanagan</strong>’s <strong><em>The Haunting of Bly Manor</em></strong>, the second entry in the talented horror filmmaker’s Netflix anthology series, it’s all but worthless.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, <em>The Haunting of Bly Manor</em> is full of recycled motifs and narrative turns that fall flat. The series&#8217; reimagining of Henry James’ tightly-wound 1898 novella, <em>The Turn of The Screw,</em> is overwrought and largely scare-free. The bones of both stories are the same: a young woman takes a position as a live-in governess tending to two orphans in the English countryside. She soon becomes fiercely protective of troubled, precocious Miles and darling Flora, even as strange sightings and disturbing stories about former household members begin to make her think the house is haunted.</p>\n<p>That’s where the similarities between Flanagan’s work and James’ end. Although <em>The Turn of the Screw</em> is slim, it’s a story that offers many readings. Depending on who you ask, it’s a veiled examination of childhood trauma, a disturbing and subtle psychosexual thriller, or an exploration of mental illness. Various on-screen adaptations have leaned more into one interpretation or another, but <em>The Haunting of Bly Manor</em> diverges entirely, telling a story about love and memory that, by later episodes, barely resembles its source material.</p>\n<p>Of course, it’s okay to go off-book if you do it well. The series’ predecessor, <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/haunting-of-hill-house-two-storms/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong><em>The Haunting of Hill House</em></strong></a>, is a beautiful reimagining of Shirley Jackson’s classic that pulls off a touching, terrifying story of grief while keeping only a thread of the original <em>The Haunting of </em><em>Hill House</em> intact. Yet <em>The Haunting of </em><em>Bly Manor</em> entirely lacks <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/the-haunting-of-hill-house-review-netflix/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the cinematic energy and unique emotional core</a> of the earlier anthology entry.</p>\n<p>The series’ problems are twofold. First and foremost, there’s not a genuine fright as far as the eye can see in <em>The Haunting of Bly Manor</em>. The unnerving thrills of <em>The Haunting of Hill House</em> (remember The Bent-Necked Lady?) cast a large shadow over <em>The Haunting of Bly Manor</em>, yet with the exception of a few moments in a later episode that are as disorienting as they are frightening, nothing in the season’s nine episodes is worth having nightmares about.</p>\n<p>The scare factor doesn’t have to be the be-all, end-all of horror, but <em>The Haunting of Bly Manor</em>’s structure is also redundant in a way that makes it a frustrating watch. Young Flora (Amelie Bea Smith) is presumably meant to be a likable character, but her only personality trait seems to be her penchant for the phrase “perfectly splendid,” or its inverse, “perfectly dreadful.” She says the phrase multiple times per episode for the first several episodes until it passes from perplexing to deeply grating. In fact, many lines in the series are repeated two, four, or even six times, as if their ubiquity will make them more meaningful.</p>\n<p>Due to a later-season twist that’s unique to Flanagan’s version, some sequences are also replayed again and again, and instead of gaining emphasis each time, they’re slowly drained of any resonance. The dollhouse metaphor is not the only thing that feels borrowed, as the series’ discombobulating structure eventually begins to mirror &#8212; yet never match &#8212; some of Flanagan’s earlier, more solidly built works.</p>\n<p>Despite being a step down for both fans of the source material and the series’ first outing, <em>The Haunting of Bly Manor</em> is not without redeeming qualities. <strong>Victoria Pedretti</strong>, who played ill-fated Nell in <em>The Haunting of Hill House</em>, headlines the series perfectly as Dani Clayton, the au pair looking after the two spooky kids. She has a great, warm presence as a hero who’s both a damn good babysitter and a mysteriously haunted woman herself. Dani’s backstory is the only one that’s truly engrossing, and whenever the series draws focus back to her, it shines a bit brighter.</p>\n<p>Several minor roles from the novella are beefed up, giving ample screentime to Bly Manor’s housekeeper (<strong>T’Nia Miller</strong>), cook (<strong>Rahul Kohli</strong>), and groundskeeper (<strong>Amelia Eve</strong>). The group’s dynamic is pleasant enough, but their characters ultimately fall prey to a wonky series structure that presents standalone stories in an isolating, exhausting way (think the split-up Losers Club sequences from <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/it-chapter-two-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>IT: Chapter Two</em></a>).</p>\n<p>Flanagan has stated that <em>The Haunting of Bly Manor</em> is a love story, and really, it contains four or five distinct love stories. By spinning a short book into a nine-hour series, the filmmaker casts a wide narrative net, working and reworking lots of ideas but only delivering on a few. The lake that sits on the edge of Bly Manor’s grounds may be deep, but in many ways, the series seems trapped in the shallows.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/kSNnrtfQ7os\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 07 Oct 2020 01:16:26 +0000","feedId":24,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"8ead20580096e121c8f276ab6205e1f7","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Valerie Ettenhofer","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/kSNnrtfQ7os":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn43@2020_2/2020/10/09/03-33-22-216_bc5bb722554edeb7.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602214364661},{"createdTime":"2020-10-09 11:32:44","updatedTime":"2020-10-09 11:32:44","title":"The Soundtrack That Fell to Earth","link":"https://filmschoolrejects.com/?p=358020","description":"\n<p id=\"block-04637504-093d-4be3-a121-b1015ed34453\"><em><br>Welcome to <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/topics/the-queue/\"><strong>The Queue</strong></a> — your daily distraction of curated video content sourced from across the web. Today, we&#8217;re watching a video about the story behind the lost David Bowie soundtrack for Nicolas Roeg&#8217;s The Man Who Fell to Earth.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s an air of detective work to loving and obsessing over &#8220;lost&#8221; cultural artifacts. And it applies to soundtracks as much as it does to films. From Lalo Schifrin&#8217;s rejected (and reportedly harrowing) score for <em>The Exorcist</em> to <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wendy-carlos-moog-synthesizer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Wendy Carlos</a>&#8216; omitted synth stylings for <em>The Shining</em>, lost scores have an enticing flavor all their own. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bowie</strong>&#8216;s proposed OST for <strong>Nicolas Roeg</strong>&#8216;s <strong><em>The Man Who Fell To Earth</em> </strong>is similarily missing in action. Not without reason, mind you. Bowie was originally contracted to star in and score Roeg&#8217;s film, a poetic LSD trip about a homesick alien tasked with saving his parched planet with Earth&#8217;s water. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Initially, Bowie planned to record the soundtrack once shooting wrapped. However, like his alien counterpart, Bowie was waylaid by earthly matters (namely, working on his <em>Young Americans</em> follow up, <em>Station to Station</em>). Ultimately, Bowie produced five (or six, depending on who you ask) disparate tracks, which, in Roeg&#8217;s estimation, were unusable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are those who believe Bowie&#8217;s score resides (sneakily) on the decidedly more cinematic second side of Bowie&#8217;s album <em>Low</em>. There are rumors that Bowie&#8217;s soundtrack lives in a studio vault. Others simply don&#8217;t believe it exists. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whatever the case, the story behind<em> The Man Who Fell to Earth</em>&#8216;s score is almost as enigmatic as Roeg’s film. For a deeper dive into Bowie&#8217;s involvement in the film&#8217;s soundtrack and the direction Roeg ultimately took, we recommend the following video essay. </p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-b5ac606c-b74a-4cab-a663-701ec85c7024\">Watch &#8220;<strong>Video Essay: The Man Who Fell To Earth</strong>&#8220;:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-vimeo wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Video Essay: The Man Who Fell to Earth\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/139967598?dnt=1&#38;app_id=122963\" width=\"700\" height=\"394\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"block-da44f2c0-01e5-442d-b111-649cfba1b5a9\">Who made this?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-97ab8436-7bdb-4e43-8f3e-4e4c57043b5e\">Founded in 1962, <strong><em>Film Comment</em> </strong>is a bi-monthly nonprofit publication operating under the auspices of Film at Lincoln Center.
