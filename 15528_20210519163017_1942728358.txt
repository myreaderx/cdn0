You can now take what once would&#8217;ve been lost and fix it in post into a beautiful and memorable image. Use this technique only when you don&#8217;t have the time or equipment to capture the proper settings on location. This bright and pastel look is the perfect vibe for photos captured on the go.</p>\n<p>Before we begin, be sure to <strong>download the <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3azmnY5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">exercise file</a></strong> and follow along as I edit on Lightroom!</p>\n<h2>Behind-The-Scenes</h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-897931 size-large\" src=\"https://www.slrlounge.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/behindthescenes-800x462.png\" alt=\"fix it in post behind the scenes\" width=\"700\" height=\"404\" srcset=\"https://www.slrlounge.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/behindthescenes.png 2500w, https://www.slrlounge.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/behindthescenes-800x462.png 800w, https://www.slrlounge.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/behindthescenes-585x338.png 585w, https://www.slrlounge.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/behindthescenes-400x231.png 400w, https://www.slrlounge.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/behindthescenes-353x204.png 353w, https://www.slrlounge.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/behindthescenes-2048x1184.png 2048w, https://www.slrlounge.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/behindthescenes-200x116.png 200w, https://www.slrlounge.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/behindthescenes-1600x925.png 1600w, https://www.slrlounge.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/behindthescenes-1536x888.png 1536w, https://www.slrlounge.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/behindthescenes-1200x694.png 1200w, https://www.slrlounge.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/behindthescenes-100x58.png 100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>The image is quite simple. My family and I came across a small patch of ferns on a family hike. I placed my newborn daughter, Josie, just behind the ferns. Then, I got down low and framed Josie against the bright patch of sky with the trees providing a natural vignette.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-897932 size-large\" src=\"https://www.slrlounge.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/capturedimage-800x436.jpg\" alt=\"fix it in post behind the scenes \" width=\"700\" height=\"382\" srcset=\"https://www.slrlounge.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/capturedimage-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://www.slrlounge.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/capturedimage-800x436.jpg 800w, https://www.slrlounge.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/capturedimage-585x319.jpg 585w, https://www.slrlounge.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/capturedimage-400x218.jpg 400w, https://www.slrlounge.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/capturedimage-374x204.jpg 374w, https://www.slrlounge.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/capturedimage-2048x1117.jpg 2048w, https://www.slrlounge.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/capturedimage-200x109.jpg 200w, https://www.slrlounge.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/capturedimage-1600x873.jpg 1600w, https://www.slrlounge.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/capturedimage-1536x838.jpg 1536w, https://www.slrlounge.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/capturedimage-1200x655.jpg 1200w, https://www.slrlounge.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/capturedimage-100x55.jpg 100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>I captured this with a <a href=\"http://adorama.rfvk.net/gjW2g\">Canon EOS R6</a> paired with the <a href=\"http://adorama.rfvk.net/4V4gM\">70-200mm f/2.8 RF</a> lens.

Rather than starting with the vibrance/saturation sliders, I&#8217;ll start with HSL. The goal is to group the colors together. I&#8217;ll start with the hues by pulling the red and orange toward the pink to negate the excessive green. Then, I&#8217;ll push the yellows, greens, cyans, and blues toward to teal.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-897968 size-large\" src=\"https://www.slrlounge.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/hsl2-800x541.jpg\" alt=\"fix it in post hsl saturation\" width=\"700\" height=\"473\" srcset=\"https://www.slrlounge.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/hsl2.jpg 1892w, https://www.slrlounge.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/hsl2-800x541.jpg 800w, https://www.slrlounge.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/hsl2-585x396.jpg 585w, https://www.slrlounge.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/hsl2-400x271.jpg 400w, https://www.slrlounge.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/hsl2-302x204.jpg 302w, https://www.slrlounge.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/hsl2-200x135.jpg 200w, https://www.slrlounge.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/hsl2-1600x1082.jpg 1600w, https://www.slrlounge.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/hsl2-1536x1039.jpg 1536w, https://www.slrlounge.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/hsl2-1200x812.jpg 1200w, https://www.slrlounge.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/hsl2-100x68.jpg 100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Using the saturation sliders, I&#8217;ll reduce the yellows and greens as well as the blues. Lastly, I&#8217;ll brighten the greens and yellows.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-897972 size-full\" src=\"https://www.slrlounge.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/colorbeforeafter-final-800x521.jpg\" alt=\"fix it in post before after\" width=\"700\" height=\"456\" srcset=\"https://www.slrlounge.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/colorbeforeafter-final.jpg 1965w, https://www.slrlounge.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/colorbeforeafter-final-800x521.jpg 800w, https://www.slrlounge.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/colorbeforeafter-final-585x381.jpg 585w, https://www.slrlounge.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/colorbeforeafter-final-400x261.jpg 400w, https://www.slrlounge.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/colorbeforeafter-final-313x204.jpg 313w, https://www.slrlounge.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/colorbeforeafter-final-200x130.jpg 200w, https://www.slrlounge.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/colorbeforeafter-final-1600x1042.jpg 1600w, https://www.slrlounge.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/colorbeforeafter-final-1536x1001.jpg 1536w, https://www.slrlounge.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/colorbeforeafter-final-1200x782.jpg 1200w, https://www.slrlounge.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/colorbeforeafter-final-100x65.jpg 100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>To wrap it all up, I warmed up the entire image using the white balance slider and with some final tweaks, we end up with our final image.</p>\n<h2>Fix it in Post Using Presets</h2>\n<p>This look is based on our Pastel Presets from Visual Flow. Be sure to save the settings out as your own preset if you like how it looks. Whenever you create your own presets, I recommend basing them on lighting conditions. I&#8217;ve created Visual Flow using a patented system of identifying lighting conditions. The result is a simplified and consistent workflow. After selecting the preset, I just raise the exposure, white balance, and tweak the contrast.</p>\n<p>These presets are tuned to many specific lighting conditions. By using these presets, I can have an entire wedding edited within a day.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion: You Should Fix it in Post</h2>\n<p>I hope this article/video provided more insight on how much flexibility you have in post production. Just be sure to shoot in RAW to retain as much information as possible. RAW images provide plenty of latitude to fix it in post and give your image the same bright pastel look.</p>\n<p>For more comprehensive tutorials, check out our Mastering Lightroom course from our Premium Content library and be sure to visit Visual Flow for the entire collection of lighting based presets.</p>\n<p>Don’t miss our next episode of <em>Mastering Your Craft</em> on Adorama’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/adoramaTV\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">YouTube channel</a> next week!
