Tasks in Teams brings together your team plans and individual tasks into one, collaborative space alongside all your chats, meetings, and files. Task management in the app replicates familiar tools and design from Planner and To Do, so there’s almost nothing new to learn. You can learn more about Tasks in Teams from <A href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/office/e32639f3-2e07-4b62-9a8c-fd706c12c070\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">our support page</A> and <A href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/planner-blog/announcing-tasks-in-microsoft-teams-public-rollout/ba-p/1502225\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">public rollout blog post</A>.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>We're also excited to report that Tasks in Teams for the Teams mobile app will soon begin rolling out to all users in non-government clouds and is scheduled to be completed in November.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><span class=\"lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center\" image-alt=\"tasksinteams_mobile.png\" style=\"width: 400px;\"><img src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/223944i7682C1623CBCB783/image-size/medium?v=1.0&amp;px=400\" role=\"button\" title=\"tasksinteams_mobile.png\" alt=\"tasksinteams_mobile.png\" /></span></P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>When the Tasks app becomes available on your iOS or Android device, you can find it within the <STRONG>More</STRONG> (…) option at the bottom of the Teams mobile app interface.
