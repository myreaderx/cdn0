This upcoming Apple Watch iteration is supposed to be a super cycle : one where the design of the watch itself changes dramatically.</p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-2717\"></span>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a couple important things coming to the Apple Watch this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>1 : Flat-edged case design</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1100\" src=\"https://watchapplist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Apple-Watch-S7-Render.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2721\" srcset=\"https://watchapplist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Apple-Watch-S7-Render.jpg 1600w, https://watchapplist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Apple-Watch-S7-Render-300x206.jpg 300w, https://watchapplist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Apple-Watch-S7-Render-768x528.jpg 768w, https://watchapplist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Apple-Watch-S7-Render-1536x1056.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Following the design of the iPhone 12 Series, the next Apple Watch iteration will also most likely include the same flat-edged design.  This gives a cleaner, more modern aesthetic as well as providing more internal space for various components. On top of this, there may also be thinner bezels this year for the Apple Watch&#8217;s screen, and a new lamination method. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>New color</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"358\" src=\"https://watchapplist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Sage-Green-Apple-Watch-Series-7.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2722\" srcset=\"https://watchapplist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Sage-Green-Apple-Watch-Series-7.jpg 640w, https://watchapplist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Sage-Green-Apple-Watch-Series-7-300x168.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Rumours are circling on a possible new color for the Apple Watch Series 7. The new color is expected to be a sage green. This draws parallels with the sage green color on the AirPods Max. The other colours expected are black, silver, red, and blue. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Improved Battery Life</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://watchapplist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/4297876_original-edited.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2725\" width=\"579\" height=\"288\" srcset=\"https://watchapplist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/4297876_original-edited.jpg 2000w, https://watchapplist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/4297876_original-edited-300x150.jpg 300w, https://watchapplist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/4297876_original-edited-768x383.jpg 768w, https://watchapplist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/4297876_original-edited-1536x766.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 579px) 100vw, 579px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This point is very likely to happen. Unlike Apple&#8217;s iPhone 12 Series which remained with the same battery life, the Apple Watch Series 7 is expected to increase battery life. This will be done by expanding the battery size and capacity, and also by the upgraded S7 Chip efficiency. It&#8217;s possible that the battery life could extend to two days.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Price</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://watchapplist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Apple-Watch-S7-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2723\" srcset=\"https://watchapplist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Apple-Watch-S7-1.jpg 1000w, https://watchapplist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Apple-Watch-S7-1-300x180.jpg 300w, https://watchapplist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Apple-Watch-S7-1-768x461.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The price for the Apple Watch Series 7 is not expected to change. This means it will remain at a starting price of <strong>$</strong>399 for the aluminium case models. </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are you excited for the Apple Watch Series 7?</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 28 Jul 2021 11:51:35 +0000","feedId":18605,"bgimg":"https://watchapplist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Apple-Watch-S7-Render.jpg","linkMd5":"cdfd138a2d717cbb7398151d48396575","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn95@2020_2/2021/09/30/14-59-24-835_fbec057b4504fcfc.webp","destWidth":1600,"destHeight":1100,"sourceBytes":155731,"destBytes":27424,"author":"Ben Macintosh","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://watchapplist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Apple-Watch-S7-Render.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn95@2020_2/2021/09/30/14-59-24-835_fbec057b4504fcfc.webp","https://watchapplist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Sage-Green-Apple-Watch-Series-7.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn26@2020_6/2021/09/30/14-59-25-936_f9e404b5b2ecef3d.webp","https://watchapplist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/4297876_original-edited.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn22@2020_6/2021/09/30/14-59-26-207_63a08009e0897d62.webp","https://watchapplist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Apple-Watch-S7-1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn20@2020_6/2021/09/30/14-59-26-145_7065bd4ec5586a3b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1633013903151}],"record":{"createdTime":"2021-09-30 22:58:23","updatedTime":"2021-09-30 22:58:23","feedId":18605,"fetchDate":"Thu, 30 Sep 2021 14:58:23 +0000","fetchMs":1170,"handleMs":7,"totalMs":64568,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":10,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"af6ca12eefe249e94a3f077d15d7c168","hostName":"europe61*","requestId":"21698e98b2204d20aa9cae3432f0b1d4_18605","contentType":"application/rss+xml;
