There, gas utilities had to pay $800 million more than they anticipated during the event, and Minnesota regulators are furious.</p>\n<p>“The ineptness and disregard for common-sense utility regulation in Texas makes my blood boil and keeps me up at night,” Katie Sieben, chairwoman of the Minnesota Public Utility Commission, told <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/04/22/minnesota-texas-freeze-centerpoint-energy/\">The Washington Post</a>. “It is maddening and outrageous and completely inexcusable that Texas’s lack of sound utility regulation is having this impact on the rest of the country.”</p>\n<p>The gas and electric markets in Texas are lightly regulated and highly competitive, which has pushed companies to deliver energy at the lowest possible cost. But it also means that many companies were ill-prepared when the mercury dropped. To save money, they had skimped on winterizing their equipment. As a result, gas lines across the state—which has about 23 percent of the country’s reserves—quite literally froze. The spot price of natural gas soared to 70-times what it would normally be in Minnesota, and gas utilities paid a hefty premium when they used the daily market to match demand.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1759766#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1759766&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=WpB-EL80pGo:q-fq8nAYet4:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=WpB-EL80pGo:q-fq8nAYet4:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=WpB-EL80pGo:q-fq8nAYet4:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=WpB-EL80pGo:q-fq8nAYet4:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=WpB-EL80pGo:q-fq8nAYet4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=WpB-EL80pGo:q-fq8nAYet4:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 23 Apr 2021 16:08:55 +0000","feedId":2,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/GettyImages-860715282-800x588.jpg","linkMd5":"6306a114ea810ce16e446bc1acb445a4","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn22@2020_4/2021/04/23/17-35-20-553_9a3c01c16dd66eca.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":588,"sourceBytes":157324,"destBytes":82112,"author":"Tim De Chant","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/GettyImages-860715282-800x588.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn22@2020_4/2021/04/23/17-35-20-553_9a3c01c16dd66eca.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=WpB-EL80pGo:q-fq8nAYet4:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn53@2020_4/2021/04/23/17-35-31-675_374bd08c16828c16.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=WpB-EL80pGo:q-fq8nAYet4:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn79@2020_6/2021/04/23/17-35-31-673_edb4928249ab180f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn91@2020_2/2021/04/23/17-35-31-640_24b37a558f772a43.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn90@2020_2/2021/04/23/17-35-32-769_f9fb6170e557e50a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1619199319003},{"createdTime":"2021-04-24 01:35:19","updatedTime":"2021-04-24 01:35:19","title":"Graphical Linux apps are coming to Windows Subsystem for Linux","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1759568","description":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n\n\n\n\n\n<div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n      <ul class=\"gallery shortcode-gallery gallery-wide\"><li>\n        <div class=\"gallery-item-content\">  \n        <div class=\"gallery-image\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/installing-WSL2-980x551.png\" alt=\"\"></div>\n        <p>\n          Assuming you've already got your system running Insider, Dev channel, and build 21364, all you need to do is wsl --install (or wsl --update, if you've already installed it).

SpaceX's Starship vehicle measures 50 meters from its nose cone to landing legs. By contrast, the cramped Lunar Module that carried Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin down to the Moon in 1969 stood just 7 meters tall.</p>\n<p>This is but one of many genuinely shocking aspects of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/04/nasa-selects-spacex-as-its-sole-provider-for-a-lunar-lander/\">NASA's decision a week ago</a> to award SpaceX—and <em>only</em> SpaceX—a contract to develop, test, and fly two missions to the lunar surface. The second flight, which will carry astronauts to the Moon, could launch as early as 2024.</p>\n<p>NASA awarded SpaceX $2.89 billion for these two missions. But this contract would balloon in amount should NASA select SpaceX to fly recurring lunar missions later in the 2020s. And it has value to SpaceX and NASA in myriad other ways. Perhaps most significantly, with this contract NASA has bet on a bold future of exploration. Until now, the plans NASA had contemplated for human exploration in deep space all had echoes of the Apollo program. NASA talked about \"sustainable\" missions and plans in terms of cost, but they were sustainable in name only.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1757643#p3\">Read 42 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1757643&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=-X0rCnAPfGU:DUeE7Fsm24o:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=-X0rCnAPfGU:DUeE7Fsm24o:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=-X0rCnAPfGU:DUeE7Fsm24o:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=-X0rCnAPfGU:DUeE7Fsm24o:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=-X0rCnAPfGU:DUeE7Fsm24o:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=-X0rCnAPfGU:DUeE7Fsm24o:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 23 Apr 2021 11:30:28 +0000","feedId":2,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/48954138962_f3b04101c4_k-800x491.jpg","linkMd5":"f78c7ed9c27be1079caa62773d2d7e04","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn4@2020_5/2021/04/23/17-35-19-131_08381c65f8ec613e.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":491,"sourceBytes":83504,"destBytes":58610,"author":"Eric Berger","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/48954138962_f3b04101c4_k-800x491.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn4@2020_5/2021/04/23/17-35-19-131_08381c65f8ec613e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=-X0rCnAPfGU:DUeE7Fsm24o:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn73@2020_4/2021/04/23/17-35-45-801_f2fa65649881e383.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=-X0rCnAPfGU:DUeE7Fsm24o:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn5@2020_3/2021/04/23/17-35-31-846_aee531876ceba4f8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn91@2020_2/2021/04/23/17-35-31-640_24b37a558f772a43.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn90@2020_2/2021/04/23/17-35-32-769_f9fb6170e557e50a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1619199319006},{"createdTime":"2021-04-24 01:35:19","updatedTime":"2021-04-24 01:35:19","title":"Rocket Report: Amazon bypasses New Glenn, SLS ready for Florida shipment","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1759479","description":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n<figure class=\"intro-image intro-left\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/s21-016_core_stage_removal_1163-1024x729-800x570.jpg\" alt=\"NASA and Boeing work to remove the SLS rocket core stage from its test stand in Mississippi.\"><p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/s21-016_core_stage_removal_1163-1024x729.jpg\" class=\"enlarge-link\" data-height=\"729\" data-width=\"1024\">Enlarge</a> <span class=\"sep\">/</span> NASA and Boeing work to remove the SLS rocket core stage from its test stand in Mississippi.

Google hired Poole <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/03/the-founder-of-4chan-joins-google-presumably-to-work-on-google/\">in 2016</a> to work on the company's doomed social media project, Google+. Poole lasted just five years at Google, which CNBC notes is usually just long enough for any employee's shares attached to hiring to vest. It sounds like Poole never found a solid landing spot at Google, as he had three different positions during his five years.</p>\n<p>Poole's 4chan is an anonymous, ephemeral imageboard that is often given the title \"cesspool of the Internet.\" The site is broken up into boards of various topics, and some of the more lawless boards are home to all of the worst characters on the Internet, like <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/10/ominous-messages-left-on-4chan-day-before-oregon-college-killings/\">school shooters</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4chan#Arrests_for_child_pornography\">child pornographers</a>, and racists. It's also the birthplace of a lot of Internet culture, like Rickrolling, lolcats, and, more recently, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/09/pepe-the-frog-creator-lawyers-up-tells-alt-right-blogs-to-cease-and-desist/\">Pepe the frog</a> memes and the alt-right. The site gave rise to the Internet hacktivist group <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2011/04/anonymous-attacks-sony-to-protest-ps3-hacker-lawsuit/\">Anonymous</a> and is often used as a dumping ground for various hacks like the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Nintendo_data_leak\">Nintendo Gigaleak</a>. Poole sold 4chan back in 2015, a year before joining Google.</p>\n<p>Back when Poole was hired, Google's fear of Facebook gave it an unhinged obsession with social media, but nobody at Google <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/08/google-minus-google-keeps-backing-all-the-wrong-social-products/\">really understood</a> how social media worked. Poole's hiring at the company was <a href=\"https://modelviewculture.com/news/google-hires-4chan-founder-sends-huge-fuck-you-to-marginalized-users\">controversial,</a> but high-ranking Google+ execs <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20170205005736/https://plus.google.com/+YonatanZunger/posts/TLPw23eiYrM\">defended</a> the move. 4chan is a social site with millions of monthly visitors, and that made Poole one of the company's few experienced social experts when he arrived.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1759713#p3\">Read 1 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1759713&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=5GCgPegqLWg:v-lUmuqZbLM:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=5GCgPegqLWg:v-lUmuqZbLM:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=5GCgPegqLWg:v-lUmuqZbLM:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=5GCgPegqLWg:v-lUmuqZbLM:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=5GCgPegqLWg:v-lUmuqZbLM:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=5GCgPegqLWg:v-lUmuqZbLM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 23 Apr 2021 16:13:18 +0000","feedId":2,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GettyImages-595284024-800x533.jpg","linkMd5":"a3f3ce299c5efbf560b26d1ced2a6726","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn13@2020_5/2021/04/23/17-35-21-141_47064e294bb55e99.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":533,"sourceBytes":53415,"destBytes":18018,"author":"Ron Amadeo","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GettyImages-595284024-800x533.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn13@2020_5/2021/04/23/17-35-21-141_47064e294bb55e99.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=5GCgPegqLWg:v-lUmuqZbLM:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn49@2020_6/2021/04/23/17-35-31-833_b266c1fe0d6ebb2f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=5GCgPegqLWg:v-lUmuqZbLM:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn8@2020_2/2021/04/23/17-35-32-019_fd8fa082faf3f611.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn91@2020_2/2021/04/23/17-35-31-640_24b37a558f772a43.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn90@2020_2/2021/04/23/17-35-32-769_f9fb6170e557e50a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1619199319003},{"createdTime":"2021-04-24 01:35:19","updatedTime":"2021-04-24 01:35:19","title":"Today, watch us play the opening of Sony’s promising PS5 exclusive Returnal","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1759734","description":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n\n\n\n\n\n<div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n      <ul class=\"gallery shortcode-gallery gallery-wide\"><li>\n        <div class=\"gallery-item-content\">  \n        <div class=\"gallery-image\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/returnal-listing01-980x824.png\" alt=\"\"></div>\n        <p>\n          All of those cracked helmets behind our hero look identical.

And it's a brand-new IP, so you may look at the headline and ask what the heck a Returnawhatzit is.</p>\n<p>But after playing a few hours of the game already, I'm compelled to connect my PS5 to my streaming rig and show you what <em>Returnal</em> is all about. This is partially because I've watched the game's official, weirdly edited video previews since its announcement last year and not understood what is going on in this procedurally generated sci-fi shooter. Seeing the game in action helps a lot. Its earliest moments feel like a refined Housemarque classic—this studio has previously impressed with games like <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/11/ps4-game-round-up-thoughts-on-four-day-one-exclusives/\"><em>Resogun</em></a> and <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/404540/Nex_Machina/\"><em>Nex Machina</em></a>—but <em>Returnal </em>is supercharged with the exploration, production values, and dark mystery of <em>Metroid Prime</em>.

Their technique even makes it possible to change, erase, or rewrite the colors several times.

The scales of chitin (a polysaccharide common to insects) are arranged like roof tiles. Essentially, they form a <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/5783709/the-colorful-story-of-diffraction-grating\">diffraction grating</a>, except these naturally occurring <a href=\"https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cocktail-party-physics/shiny-things-an-ode-to-photonic-crystals/\">photonic crystals</a> only produce certain colors, or wavelengths, of light, while a diffraction grating will produce the entire spectrum, much like a prism. Alter the structure by changing the size of the tiles, and the crystals become sensitive to a different wavelength. And the perception of color doesn't depend on the viewing angle. </p>\n<p>Manmade \"nanopillars\" can also be used to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/09/this-tiny-reproduction-of-girl-with-a-pearl-earring-is-painted-with-light/\">generate structural colors</a>, for instance, by illuminating nanopillar arrays with white light to produce specific colors (red, blue, and green light), simply by varying the sizes (widths) of the nanopillars. In fact, last year, scientists at the National Institute of Science and Technology (NIST) used millions of nanopillars in an array to control both the color and intensity of incident light, projecting <a href=\"https://www.osapublishing.org/optica/fulltext.cfm?uri=optica-7-9-1171&#38;id=437893\">a faithful reproduction</a> of Johannes Vermeer's <em>Girl With a Pearl Earring</em> as a proof of concept.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1758287#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1758287&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=8L8AM074Ojs:7WxTDXtBvX8:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=8L8AM074Ojs:7WxTDXtBvX8:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=8L8AM074Ojs:7WxTDXtBvX8:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=8L8AM074Ojs:7WxTDXtBvX8:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=8L8AM074Ojs:7WxTDXtBvX8:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=8L8AM074Ojs:7WxTDXtBvX8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 22 Apr 2021 22:39:41 +0000","feedId":2,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=8L8AM074Ojs:7WxTDXtBvX8:V_sGLiPBpWU","linkMd5":"f48237b71df617a6b89aec21e3a728c5","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn27@2020_4/2021/04/23/17-35-23-652_8df836a63c6bcc0b.webp","destWidth":66,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":1009,"destBytes":340,"author":"Jennifer Ouellette","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=8L8AM074Ojs:7WxTDXtBvX8:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn27@2020_4/2021/04/23/17-35-23-652_8df836a63c6bcc0b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=8L8AM074Ojs:7WxTDXtBvX8:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn12@2020_5/2021/04/23/17-35-35-049_a71afcff2916343d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn91@2020_2/2021/04/23/17-35-31-640_24b37a558f772a43.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn90@2020_2/2021/04/23/17-35-32-769_f9fb6170e557e50a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1619199319008},{"createdTime":"2021-04-24 01:35:19","updatedTime":"2021-04-24 01:35:19","title":"Today’s best tech deals: M1 MacBook Air, PS5 controllers, and more","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1759288","description":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n<figure class=\"intro-image intro-left\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/dealmaster042321-800x444.jpg\" alt=\"Today’s best tech deals: M1 MacBook Air, PS5 controllers, and more\"><p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/dealmaster042321.jpg\" class=\"enlarge-link\" data-height=\"1200\" data-width=\"2160\">Enlarge</a> (credit: Ars Technica)</p>  </figure><div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>Today's Dealmaster includes a solid deal on Apple's latest MacBook Air, as the entry-level model is <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3ndk9mx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">currently down to $899</a> at various retailers.

There's even what looks like an 8-pin power connector on the end because PCI-E just isn't enough power.</p>\n<p>Google provided a lovely chip diagram that lists 10 \"encoder cores\" on each chip, with Google's white paper adding that \"all other elements are off-the-shelf IP blocks.\" Google says that \"each encoder core can encode 2160p in realtime, up to 60 FPS (frames per second) using three reference frames.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1759330#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1759330&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=c3HUiGod6p8:EU1j0osTuGI:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=c3HUiGod6p8:EU1j0osTuGI:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=c3HUiGod6p8:EU1j0osTuGI:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=c3HUiGod6p8:EU1j0osTuGI:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=c3HUiGod6p8:EU1j0osTuGI:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=c3HUiGod6p8:EU1j0osTuGI:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 22 Apr 2021 18:24:26 +0000","feedId":2,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/24-800x450.jpg","linkMd5":"fbf0f04d19e84f9b967ab7be1c535668","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn86@2020_6/2021/04/23/17-35-19-263_c040a14d26bab55e.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":450,"sourceBytes":76954,"destBytes":57320,"author":"Ron Amadeo","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/24-800x450.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn86@2020_6/2021/04/23/17-35-19-263_c040a14d26bab55e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=c3HUiGod6p8:EU1j0osTuGI:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn3@2020_6/2021/04/23/17-35-32-004_fd28db25255a8f24.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=c3HUiGod6p8:EU1j0osTuGI:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn98@2020_3/2021/04/23/17-35-31-667_8fbe42b5efa4c36c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn91@2020_2/2021/04/23/17-35-31-640_24b37a558f772a43.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn90@2020_2/2021/04/23/17-35-32-769_f9fb6170e557e50a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1619199319009},{"createdTime":"2021-04-24 01:35:19","updatedTime":"2021-04-24 01:35:19","title":"A Clubhouse bug let people lurk in rooms invisibly","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1759717","description":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n<figure class=\"intro-image intro-left\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/clubhouse-list-800x450.jpg\" alt=\"A Clubhouse bug let people lurk in rooms invisibly\"><p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/clubhouse-list.jpg\" class=\"enlarge-link\" data-height=\"675\" data-width=\"1200\">Enlarge</a> (credit: Sam Whitney | Wired | Getty Images)</p>  </figure><div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p><span class=\"lead-in-text-callout\">“Basically, I'm going</span> to keep talking to you, but I’m going to disappear,\" longtime security researcher Katie Moussouris told me in a private Clubhouse room in February. “We'll still be talking, but I'll be gone.” And then her avatar vanished. I was alone, or at least that's how it seemed. “That’s it,\" she said from the digital beyond. \"That's the bug. I am a fucking ghost.”</p>\n<p>It's been more than a year since the audio social network Clubhouse debuted. In that time, its <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/inside-clubhouse-audio-app-paul-davison-rohan-seth/\">explosive growth</a> has come with a panoply of <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/clubhouse-privacy-security-growth/\">security, privacy, and abuse issues</a>. That includes a <a href=\"https://www.lutasecurity.com/post/new-clubhouse-security-vulnerabilities-could-happen-to-any-growing-unicorn\">newly disclosed</a> pair of vulnerabilities, discovered by Moussouris and now fixed, that could have allowed an attacker to lurk and listen in a Clubhouse room undetected or verbally disrupt a discussion beyond a moderator's control.</p>\n<p>The vulnerability could also be exploited with virtually no technical knowledge. All you needed was two iPhones that had Clubhouse installed and a Clubhouse account. (Clubhouse is still only available on iOS.) To launch the attack, you would first log in to your Clubhouse account on Phone A and then join or start a room. Then you'd log in to your Clubhouse account on Phone B—which would automatically log you out on Phone A—and join the same room. That's where the problems started. Phone A would show a login screen but wouldn't fully log you out. You'd still have a live connection to the room you were in. Once you “left” that same room on Phone B, you would disappear but could maintain your ghost connection on Phone A.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1759717#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1759717&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=zIPV_GWPSf4:GTvVyR_PmHw:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=zIPV_GWPSf4:GTvVyR_PmHw:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=zIPV_GWPSf4:GTvVyR_PmHw:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=zIPV_GWPSf4:GTvVyR_PmHw:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=zIPV_GWPSf4:GTvVyR_PmHw:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=zIPV_GWPSf4:GTvVyR_PmHw:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 23 Apr 2021 14:26:11 +0000","feedId":2,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/clubhouse-list-800x450.jpg","linkMd5":"a1c3bd6c091fa40987cb0b525b454ae1","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn39@2020_6/2021/04/23/17-35-19-138_9d389a83d4e0add5.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":450,"sourceBytes":61320,"destBytes":37536,"author":"WIRED","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/clubhouse-list-800x450.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn39@2020_6/2021/04/23/17-35-19-138_9d389a83d4e0add5.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=zIPV_GWPSf4:GTvVyR_PmHw:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn81@2020_4/2021/04/23/17-35-31-668_b5c71b62e54097eb.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=zIPV_GWPSf4:GTvVyR_PmHw:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn29@2020_5/2021/04/23/17-35-31-674_b9d1e715061a7700.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn91@2020_2/2021/04/23/17-35-31-640_24b37a558f772a43.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn90@2020_2/2021/04/23/17-35-32-769_f9fb6170e557e50a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1619199319005}],"record":{"createdTime":"2021-04-24 01:35:19","updatedTime":"2021-04-24 01:35:19","feedId":2,"fetchDate":"Fri, 23 Apr 2021 17:35:19 +0000","fetchMs":28,"handleMs":87,"totalMs":31890,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":20,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"79b59b7ab14b8d981e3d8a220e20848a","hostName":"us-022*","requestId":"01151431bf9b40e6adaf87bb90fb5dc8_2","contentType":"text/xml; charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":798964,"bgimgsTotal":20,"bgimgsGithubTotal":20,"articlesImgsTotal":62,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":62,"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx8":1,"myreaderx14":2,"myreaderx15":2,"myreaderx7":2,"myreaderx16":2,"myreaderx6":3,"myreaderx32":2,"myreaderx10":2,"myreaderx4":2,"myreaderx3":3,"myreaderx33":2,"myreaderx11":2,"myreaderx12":3,"myreaderx2":2,"myreaderx1":3,"myreaderx13":2,"myreaderx30":2,"myreaderx31":2,"myreaderx18":2,"myreaderx19":2,"myreaderx":2,"myreaderx25":2,"myreaderx27":2,"myreaderx21":1,"myreaderx22":3,"myreaderx23":2,"myreaderx24":3,"myreaderx5oss":2,"myreaderx29":2},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-05-30 17:21:38","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 13:47:33","id":2,"name":"Ars Technica","url":"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/arstechnica/index","subscriber":null,"website":null,"icon":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/cropped-ars-logo-512_480-32x32.png","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx61/cdn62@2020_5/2020/09/05/05-47-27-309_5d81b97433efbdc7.png","description":"Serving the Technologist for more than a decade.
