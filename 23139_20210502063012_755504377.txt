deceptively simple – only four major movements.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/strength-training-101-how-to-squat-properly/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bodyweight squats</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/proper-push-up/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Push-ups</a></li> \n <li><a

href=\"https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/inverted-row-are-you-missing-out-on-this-great-exercise/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">inverted rows</a>)</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy7QOQEZ8Rg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Planks</a></li> \n</ul> \n<p>If you don’t have time to run through the whole sequence, no problem!</p> \n<p>Depending on how much time you have during the day, you can do your whole workout at once, or break up your training into four different sessions throughout the day (with each session being ONE of the exercises).</p> \n<p><strong>Here’s a sample day for your No-Equipment Workout:</strong></p> \n<ul> \n <li>Wake up, do 40 jumping jacks to warm up, and then do bodyweight squats.</li> \n <li>At lunch, you grab your suitcase (if you’re at work, milk jug if you’re at home) and do inverted rows.</li> \n <li>After work, you do another 50 jumping jacks and then do your push-ups.</li> \n <li>After dinner, you do your planks while watching TV.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>You could even split it up over two days if needed, but the goal would be to do it the whole sequence at once.</p> \n<p><strong>The main <a href=\"https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/angry-birds-workout-plan/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Angry Birds Workout</a> article describes in detail
