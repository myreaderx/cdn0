What makes this one stand apart from other game dev competitions, is the game size limit of 13 kilobytes. Yes, Just 13KB for everything, including code, images, graphics, sounds! Moreover, a theme is decided every year and the game, ideally, should be based on that. This results in a lot of brainstorming and innovative ideas. For this year, the theme was '<strong>offline</strong>'.</p> \n<p>The competition is organized by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/end3r\">Andrzej Mazur</a> who is also one of the judges. They play every submitted game at the end of the competition and give their reviews in terms of what went right &amp; in what directions improvements could be made. Needless to say, there are a lot of prizes like gadgets, t-shirts, and stickers to be won every year.</p> \n<h2 id=\"preparations\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"https://engineering.wingify.com//posts/js13k-game-development/#preparations\" aria-label=\"preparations permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"> \n  <svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"> \n   <path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path> \n  </svg></a>Preparations</h2> \n<p>JS13K competition is not new to folks at Wingify. A couple of us have prior experience of this. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chinchang457\">Kush</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gauravmuk\">Gaurav</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/s0ftvar\">Varun</a> had participated in previous JS13K events. Having experienced &amp; enjoyed the competition first hand, they felt compelled to inform the rest of us as well.</p> \n<p>After the first week since the beginning of the competition, we all met and the veterans of this competition introduced us to the rules &amp; theme, basic techniques related to game development, &amp; tools that might be handy along the way. We were a little short on time considering that we had to first come up with feasible concepts &amp; our primary experience being Frontend SPA development, creating these games was about to be unlike any code we professionally write. </p> \n<h2 id=\"entries\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"https://engineering.wingify.com//posts/js13k-game-development/#entries\" aria-label=\"entries permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"> \n  <svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"> \n   <path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path> \n  </svg></a>Entries</h2> \n<h3 id=\"twisty-polyhedra\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"https://engineering.wingify.com//posts/js13k-game-development/#twisty-polyhedra\" aria-label=\"twisty polyhedra permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"> \n  <svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"> \n   <path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path> \n  </svg></a><a href=\"http://js13kgames.com/entries/twisty-polyhedra\">Twisty Polyhedra</a></h3> \n<p>Author: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Aditya_r_m\">Aditya Mishra</a></p> \n<p>The concept behind this one is simple, You will have access to Rubik's cube variants of different sizes &amp; shapes to solve.

It's also worth mentioning that given how complex the implementations of these simple concepts tend to become, an understanding of software design principles is not only a requirement while building these things, but also grows really well with such an experience.</p> \n<p>Most of the integrated effects &amp; animations we had to create on our own. Some of our games also involved a degree of focus on keeping the algorithms fast, for example, by managing object lifecycles to keep the computations limited to only visible entities, by using clever little hacks to avoid redundant computations while rendering etc.</p> \n<p>In the instances where third party libraries were used, we had to make sure they introduced very little overhead. 2 of the listed games leveraged <a href=\"https://github.com/straker/kontra\">Kontra.js</a>, a micro-library to get up &amp; running quickly without introducing any significant impact to build size. Kontra.js provides nice features such as sprite management &amp; out of the box collision detection etc. Galactic Shooter also used a slightly altered version of <a href=\"https://github.com/mneubrand/jsfxr\">jsfxr</a>, a lightweight sound generation library.</p> \n<p>For the build process, almost all of us followed a different path. In small games, <a href=\"https://webpack.js.org/\">Webpack</a> was suitable for bundling the source. For some larger ones, we wanted to avoid even the tiniest of the overhead introduced by Webpack. Therefore, we used simple <a href=\"https://gruntjs.com/\">Grunt</a> / <a href=\"https://gulpjs.com/\">Gulp</a> tasks to concatenate &amp; minify files. In some cases, we even avoided using <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/\">Closure Compiler</a>, as arrow functions &amp; classes result in much more concise code. Apart from these, we experimented with various compression tools &amp; techniques for fitting all those JS/HTML/CSS/PNG files in 13K size limit. But one way or another, we managed to make it for all of the entries.</p> \n<h2 id=\"conclusion\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"https://engineering.wingify.com//posts/js13k-game-development/#conclusion\" aria-label=\"conclusion permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"> \n  <svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"> \n   <path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path> \n  </svg></a>Conclusion</h2> \n<p>Participation in this event did require committing a significant amount of personal time to it but proved to be an amazing experience not only in terms of what we learned from it but also in how much fun we had while implementing these concepts. After all, game development is as fun as it gets when it comes to programming - <strong><em>creating a tiny universe of your own, the laws of physics are what you want them to be, things evolve how you tell them to</em></strong>. And we certainly managed to pick up some nice ideas along the way.</p> \n<p>We would love to hear your feedback or answer any queries you might have, feel free to drop a comment or tweet us at <a
