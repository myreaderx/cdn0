It was a really good night, a fabulous audience which was double their normal attendance and I also got the chance to sink a few drinks with my old friend <a href=\"http://csswizardry.com\">Harry</a>. It’s very likely that I won’t give this talk again in Europe this year, and I wanted to share it with more people, so I’ve written a transcript to accompany the slides.</p> \n<p><strong>NB:</strong> This page contains <i>8Mb of images</i>.

Work that goes beyond making a digital product or website something that people find easy to use, by making it something they like and remember using through creative design.</p> \n<p>A good deal of my work over recent years has involved creating design systems, pattern libraries and style guides for clients including SunLife and WWF. These tools have become incredibly fashionable, with articles, talks and even entire conferences like Clarity devoted to them.</p> \n<figure> \n <img src=\"https://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/content/img/2017-01-19-004.jpg\" alt=\"\"> \n  <figcaption>\n   Brad Frost\n  </figcaption> </img>\n</figure> \n<p>Perhaps the most well known design system methodology used on the web today is <a href=\"http://bradfrost.com\">Brad Frost</a>’s Atomic Web Design.

Sometimes we’re referring to static style or visual identity guides, other times voice and tone.</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Static style or visual identity guides and books which illustrate how a brand should be presented and how its assets should be used across media. These are often published in PDF format.</li> \n <li>Voice and tone guides which describe a brand’s personality through the way it speaks to its customers.</li> \n <li>Front-end code guidelines for developers, stipulating coding standards to encourage better collaboration across development teams.</li> \n <li>Component or pattern libraries which commonly contain examples of how to style the atoms, molecules, organisms and templates that Brad describes in Atomic Web Design.</li> \n</ul> \n<figure> \n <img src=\"https://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/content/img/2017-01-19-009.jpg\" alt=\"\"> \n  <figcaption></figcaption> </img>\n</figure> \n<p>In my work, and I suspect in most of yours, when we talk about a living style guide for the web, we’re combining visual identity guides with component/pattern libraries.</p> \n<figure> \n <img src=\"https://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/content/img/2017-01-19-010.jpg\" alt=\"\"> \n  <figcaption></figcaption> </img>\n</figure> \n<p>These all offer something different but more often than not they have something in common. They look ugly enough to have been designed by someone who enjoys configuring a router.</p> \n<p>Sadly the importance of creative, thoughtful design in a style guide is lost on some people, who dismiss it as decoration that’s less important than functionality. OK, that was mean, not everyone’s going to think an unimaginative style guide design is a problem. After all, as long as a style guide contains information people need, how it looks shouldn’t matter, should it?</p> \n<p>Many miss the fact that beauty in design complements functionality rather than detract from it. Creative design enhances someone’s engagement with a tool such as a style guide and amplifies the important information that it contains. This means that to be effective, a style guide should present its content in appealing and engaging ways.</p> \n<figure> \n <img src=\"https://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/content/img/2017-01-19-012.jpg\" alt=\"\"> \n  <figcaption>\n    British Rail Corporate Identity Manual\n  </figcaption> </img>\n</figure> \n<p>Interest in design systems has also meant that reproductions of corporate design manuals have become popular.

If you’re looking for markup and styles to code a ‘media’ component, you’re probably going to be the technical type, whereas if you need to understand the balance of sizes across a typographic hierarchy, you’re more likely to be a creative. What you need from a style guide is different and yet so many style guides follow the same patterns.</p> \n<h3>Colour</h3> \n<p>I’ll start by looking at colour, which alongside typography, colour’s one of the most important ingredients in a design. Colour communicates personality, creates mood and is vital to an easily understandable interactive vocabulary. So you’d think that an average style guide would describe all this in any number of imaginative ways. Well, you’d be disappointed, because the most inspiring you’ll find looks like a collection of chips from a paint chart.</p> \n<figure> \n <img src=\"https://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/content/img/2017-01-19-018.jpg\" alt=\"\"> \n  <figcaption>\n   Lonely Planet\n  </figcaption> </img>\n</figure> \n<p><a href=\"http://rizzo.lonelyplanet.com/styleguide/design-elements/colours\">Lonely Planet’s Rizzo</a> does a great job of separating its Design Elements from UI Components but you’ll struggle to get a feeling for Lonely Planet’s design by looking at their colour chips.</p> \n<figure> \n <img src=\"https://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/content/img/2017-01-19-019.jpg\" alt=\"\"> \n  <figcaption>\n   Greenpeace\n  </figcaption> </img>\n</figure> \n<p><a href=\"http://ggw-prototype.goalgorilla.com/design-elements/colors.html\">Greenpeace’s style guide</a> uses the same approach.\n <!--</p--> \n <figure> \n  <img src=\"https://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/content/img/2017-01-19-020.jpg\" alt=\"\"> \n   <figcaption>\n    Sky\n   </figcaption> </img>\n </figure> <p>As did <a href=\"http://skyglobal.github.io/web-toolkit/#base-styles--colours\">Sky’s old web toolkit</a>.</p> \n <figure> \n  <img src=\"https://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/content/img/2017-01-19-021.jpg\" alt=\"\"> \n   <figcaption>\n    The Times\n   </figcaption> </img>\n </figure> <p>And <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/styleguide/colours\">The Times’ functional palette</a>.</p> \n <figure> \n  <img src=\"https://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/content/img/2017-01-19-022.jpg\" alt=\"\"> \n   <figcaption>\n    GOV.UK\n   </figcaption> </img>\n </figure> <p><a href=\"http://govuk-elements.herokuapp.com/colour/\">GOV.UK</a>—not a website known for its creative flair—varies this approach by using circles, which I find strange as circles don’t feature anywhere else in its branding or design.
