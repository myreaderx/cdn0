More and more companies are extending remote work guidance until the beginning of 2021 and some companies have moved to a work from home program permanently. When you’re remote-first as GitHub has been since the start, and continually promoting a remote-friendly culture, helping teams be productive regardless of where anyone works is key to a successful business and reflects the global GitHub community.</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For this last post in the </span><a href=\"https://github.blog/category/company/remote-work/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">remote work series</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Jason Warner, GitHub CTO, and I share steps for how managers and senior leaders can approach working with remote teams. Jason has been a remote executive for more than 10 years, and is familiar with the challenges and opportunities that distributed workforces generally present. I’ve been working a hybrid model for many years, splitting time between an office and working from home, and managing an international program across all time zones.</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are our recommendations for taking remote team management to the next level as we think about our future work environment:&nbsp;</span></p> \n<h2 id=\"step-1-ensure-trust-is-a-central-part-of-your-remote-culture\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Step 1: Ensure trust is a central part of your remote culture</span><a href=\"https://github.blog/?p=53922#step-1-ensure-trust-is-a-central-part-of-your-remote-culture\" class=\"heading-link\" aria-label=\"<span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>Step 1: Ensure trust is a central part of your remote culture</span>\" data-anchorjs-icon=\"#\" style=\"padding-left: 0.375em;\"></a></h2> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Successfully managing remote teams and building remote cultures is no easy task. We always equate the importance of collaboration and trust to open source development, which is deeply collaborative with developers contributing and working together from around the world. Building a productive remote team while supporting individual wellbeing are some of the key leadership principles in today’s environment. So, it’s imperative to build trust as a remote leader.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First, be overly communicative on a regular basis and in multiple forums. Second, empathetically communicate with team members in a two-way direction, meaning don’t just broadcast, and don’t just talk to small groups to engage and solicit feedback. In a remote work environment, engaging with a broader group helps get more input and support from across the company or teams for any program or initiative. And it’s important to follow up and act on feedback in order to solidify trust and great teamwork.</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And third, it’s crucial to be transparent. Talk about the “life” things you have in common—you may find that people are just like you, squeezing in dog walks, making family lunches, drowning out noises from in or around the house, and taking care of loved ones of all ages. These life moments help all of us get to know each other and better understand what’s happening outside our screens.</span></p> \n<h2 id=\"step-2-clear-up-your-lines-of-communication\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Step 2: Clear up your lines of communication</span><a href=\"https://github.blog/?p=53922#step-2-clear-up-your-lines-of-communication\" class=\"heading-link\" aria-label=\"<span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>Step 2: Clear up your lines of communication</span>\" data-anchorjs-icon=\"#\" style=\"padding-left: 0.375em;\"></a></h2> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As seasoned remote leaders, we’ve seen some of the best and most challenging human behaviors amplified when team members are distributed. Working remotely is becoming more of a norm for all of us at this point, and communication is key to working together.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the most common challenges is that people come to conclusions of fear and doubt in their work because of lack of responses, short notes, or mid-read jokes or sarcasm that work well in-person but not so well in writing. On the flip side, others tend to micromanage and try to over-communicate because they can’t see each other physically doing their job.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The solution? As you drill into the behavior mechanisms of uncertainty or micromanagement, it’s often a lack of transparency or trust at the core. So, figure out which one it is and work with your team to fix it – typically, it’s finding better channels to communicate. Ask yourself: Are you communicating clearly with your teams? Many of the recommendations from Hubbers in our remote work series share that documenting communication is key (</span><a href=\"https://github.blog/category/company/remote-work/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">be sure to check out the blog series</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">). This includes how decisions are being made and how the team can track progress. As a leader, help set a great example with your communication, and others will increase their engagement as well.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<h2 id=\"step-3-use-the-right-tools\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Step 3: Use the right tools</span><a href=\"https://github.blog/?p=53922#step-3-use-the-right-tools\" class=\"heading-link\" aria-label=\"<span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>Step 3: Use the right tools</span>\" data-anchorjs-icon=\"#\" style=\"padding-left: 0.375em;\"></a></h2> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Working remotely or in the office requires the same set of tools to be successful: institutional memory, video, email and chat. These tools help to establish strong connections with your team.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Institutional memory is key and something that we do really well at GitHub, especially with our platform serving as a quintessential institutional memory tool. You write something down in an issue, others make comments, you ratify the decision, and have a link to share with others. That’s the beauty of asynchronous communication—your decisions happen in text and threads. Once they’re locked down, they stay there. Email can also serve this need, but we’ve all experienced email overload. So use email for communicating out, but not conversations.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Video is another important tool. It’s the highest fidelity communication channel we have right now to see and convey emotional context, which you cannot always get from written communication.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, there are Slack and open source alternatives such as IRC. These tools are great for real-time, quick communication between a handful of folks. But when decisions are made, they should be memorialized in a different system. Backscrolling and searching channels are likely something we’ve all spent too much time doing to look back on conversations and decisions.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<h2 id=\"step-4-set-global-teams-up-for-success\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Step 4: Set global teams up for success</span><a href=\"https://github.blog/?p=53922#step-4-set-global-teams-up-for-success\" class=\"heading-link\" aria-label=\"<span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>Step 4: Set global teams up for success</span>\" data-anchorjs-icon=\"#\" style=\"padding-left: 0.375em;\"></a></h2> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Think global if your business is global. We both have team members based all over the world, so typically we try to find times that overlap for various projects. A good rule of thumb is to create teams with four hours of time zone overlap, with the bare minimum being two hours. This lessens the need for individuals to work outside of normal working hours, and is optimal for program workflow. If that’s simply not possible, give teams with no time zone overlap work that can be done in a hand-off style–when one team signs off for the day, they record their work in your institutional memory tool, so that the next team can pick up when they sign on.</span></p> \n<h2 id=\"step-5-lead-by-example\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Step 5: Lead by example</span><a href=\"https://github.blog/?p=53922#step-5-lead-by-example\" class=\"heading-link\" aria-label=\"<span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>Step 5: Lead by example</span>\" data-anchorjs-icon=\"#\" style=\"padding-left: 0.375em;\"></a></h2> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are both passionate about what we do, and it’s too easy to be connected all the time. We recommend putting some measures in place to create space for mental wellbeing. As a leader, the best advice is to model behavior that you want and what you think is acceptable. This includes helping people understand that they do not need to be connected 24/7. For example, during the school year, I (Laura) am my daughter’s lunch buddy, and take an hour to eat and play outside–things that my daughter would typically do during lunch at school. For me (Jason), health and family are two things I prioritize, so I set time aside every day to workout and have family dinner with the kids. We hope by sharing our personal experiences, others will know it’s okay to prioritize family, health, and life in general. Because when we’re all remote, communicating helps everyone work better together.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It has been a pleasure to share our remote work best practices from so many of the teams at GitHub–engineering, talent acquisition, IT, workplace experience, and more.

During the pandemic, Anand moved from Netherlands back to his family in India. He soon realised the disproportionate impact COVID was having on the country:</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>[There’s a] disproportionate impact of the lockdown on migrant workers and daily wage earners. With no work, these laborers were having trouble feeding their families. For me, I could comfortably stay at home for months, but this was not true for millions of Indians.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>Anand wanted to do something about it. So he and his team founded <a href=\"https://github.com/Karuna2020\">Karuna 2020</a>. It’s open sourced on GitHub and is an initiative to help those most affected by COVID:</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>We built a “dream team” of startups, corporates, and nonprofits, and founded Karuna 2020… We started collecting donations and built a “dry ration kit” to sustain a family for a month, and partnered with nonprofits to manufacture masks to distribute among healthcare, police, and other front-line workers.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>This would be a tremendous amount of work. Luckily, Anand and the team use GitHub Actions to help make this whole process smoother.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-53961 size-large\" src=\"https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1500x500.jpeg?w=1024&amp;resize=1024%2C341\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"341\" srcset=\"https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1500x500.jpeg?w=1500 1500w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1500x500.jpeg?w=300 300w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1500x500.jpeg?w=768 768w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1500x500.jpeg?w=1024&amp;resize=1024%2C341 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p> \n<h2 id=\"github-actions-for-karuna-2020\">GitHub Actions for Karuna 2020<a href=\"https://github.blog/?p=53959#github-actions-for-karuna-2020\" class=\"heading-link\" aria-label=\"GitHub Actions for Karuna 2020\" data-anchorjs-icon=\"#\" style=\"padding-left: 0.375em;\"></a></h2> \n<p>From the start, Anand wanted Karuna to be open source. He wanted to ensure everything they were doing was “completely open and transparent”. GitHub Actions has been a central part of the Karuna project:</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>Using GitHub Actions, we developed several open-sourced workflows that automate tasks like building our website, hosting our open data APIs, and even our open source guidelines for front-line workers.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>Actions allow the team to help more people quicker. Anand gives a great example of how GitHub Actions has helped reduce manual labour and make better use of volunteer hours:</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>For every dry ration kit we distributed, we took a photo of the recipient and shared it on our website to be completely transparent to our donors. In order to protect the beneficiaries’ privacy, we wanted to make sure we blur their faces before uploading their photo. For the first few days, this was a manual process, taking up several volunteer hours.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<div id=\"attachment_53964\" style=\"width: 966px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n <img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-53964\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-53964 size-full\" src=\"https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Blurred-faces.png?resize=956%2C484\" alt=\"\" width=\"956\" height=\"484\" srcset=\"https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Blurred-faces.png?resize=956%2C484?w=956 956w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Blurred-faces.png?resize=956%2C484?w=300 300w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Blurred-faces.png?resize=956%2C484?w=768 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 956px) 100vw, 956px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" />\n <p id=\"caption-attachment-53964\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photos are automatically blurred out. This saves hundreds of volunteer hours. Check out more images on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/karuna2020_org/\">Karuna’s Instagram</a>.</p>\n</div> \n<p>By using GitHub Actions, this work was able to be automated. A script was built by one of the volunteers. This python script uses <a href=\"https://github.com/telesoho/faceblur\">faceblur</a> and then uploads the new photo to distribution cards on Airtable. The Airtable then populates the website.</p> \n<h2 id=\"actions-for-all-your-needs\">Actions for all your needs<a href=\"https://github.blog/?p=53959#actions-for-all-your-needs\" class=\"heading-link\" aria-label=\"Actions for all your needs\" data-anchorjs-icon=\"#\" style=\"padding-left: 0.375em;\"></a></h2> \n<p>Using a similar method above, the Karuna team have automated several processes using GitHub Actions. There’s also an Action that generates a tax invoice and automatically sends it to the recipient. It even uses <a href=\"https://github.blog/changelog/2019-11-01-github-actions-scheduled-jobs-maximum-frequency-is-changing\">GitHub Action’s scheduling feature</a> to have this run every few hours.</p> \n<p>The team at Karuna says GitHub Actions has helped them immensely. Actions has allowed them to make the biggest impact possible.</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>Anand and the team want to share this impact with others. Head over to <a href=\"https://karuna2020.org/\">Karuna’s website</a> for lots of information and resources. They have detailed guides for all their processes. This includes donor lifecycle, onboarding volunteers, designing creatives, and posting on social media.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<h2 id=\"making-information-available-through-actions\">Making information available through Actions<a href=\"https://github.blog/?p=53959#making-information-available-through-actions\" class=\"heading-link\" aria-label=\"Making information available through Actions\" data-anchorjs-icon=\"#\" style=\"padding-left: 0.375em;\"></a></h2> \n<p>Whilst Karuna is doing an amazing job with the COVID-19 relief effort in India, they don’t want to stop there. Karuna’s main goal is to build open source processes, guides, tools, and APIs for nonprofits. They want to provide this all free of charge. As Anand says, making this available will help NFPs better manage resources:</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>[these resources help] make [NFP’s] operations more efficient and let them focus on what they do best.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>Anand’s favourite thing about GitHub Actions has been offering this information for free. According to Anand, Actions is what is helping Karuna make a real impact on the world:</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>All the tools we’re using are open source. They work with GitHub Actions without requiring a self-hosted instance. This has been the most important feature for us. We’re able to design complex processes and automating important tasks, without requiring dedicated servers. GitHub Actions offers a powerful way not only to test and deploy code, but to create real impact in the world.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<h2 id=\"get-involved\">Get involved<a href=\"https://github.blog/?p=53959#get-involved\" class=\"heading-link\" aria-label=\"Get involved\" data-anchorjs-icon=\"#\" style=\"padding-left: 0.375em;\"></a></h2> \n<p>What a story! Not only is GitHub Actions able to help automate workflow, it helps people make a bigger impact when it matters.</p> \n<p>We hope you enjoyed our interview with Anand Chowdhary. As he said, GitHub Actions is here to help us make our processes better and allow us to focus on the things we do best.

Connect with the tools you know and love. Have more freedom to innovate and be creative. Deploy to any cloud, build containers, automate messages, and lots more. It’s time to take control.</p> \n<p>There’s lots of amazing <a href=\"https://github.blog/changelog/2020-07-06-github-actions-manual-triggers-with-workflow_dispatch\">Actions</a> built every day. We spoke to some of the coolest developers building the latest Actions. Last week, we shared <a href=\"https://github.blog/2020-08-13-github-actions-karuna/\">Karuna’s story</a>. This week we have <a href=\"https://github.com/hookkshot\">Keirron Stach</a>. Keirron, AKA Hookkshot, also shared some of his experiences during <a href=\"https://github.blog/2020-04-21-meet-some-of-this-years-github-satellite-speakers/\">GitHub Satellite</a>. During this session, Hookkshot gave his tips on better game development. Today, he shares his GitHub Action.</p> \n<p><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JAFUZ5Bh74I?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></p> \n<h2 id=\"starting-with-the-sims\">Starting with the <em>Sims</em><a href=\"https://github.blog/?p=54002#starting-with-the-sims\" class=\"heading-link\" aria-label=\"Starting with the <em>Sims</em>\" data-anchorjs-icon=\"#\" style=\"padding-left: 0.375em;\"></a></h2> \n<p>Like many of our previous Action heroes such as <a href=\"https://github.blog/2020-07-24-github-action-hero-samson-amaugo/\">Samson</a>, Hookkshot started with a passion. He loved gaming and working on software. It all started when he was about 10 years old:</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>I was playing the Sims and wanted to make a small website for my character, I don’t remember why, but ever since, I have been hooked on programming and making software.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>Since this day, Hookkshot has been seen making games, developing games, and of course, playing games. He’s currently working full time and making games as a hobby. He plans to release this game under his own company brand which he’s building out. As for GitHub Actions, this is where Hookkshot’s Actions journey begins.</p> \n<h2 id=\"github-actions-for-build-deploy\">GitHub Actions for build deploy<a href=\"https://github.blog/?p=54002#github-actions-for-build-deploy\" class=\"heading-link\" aria-label=\"GitHub Actions for build deploy\" data-anchorjs-icon=\"#\" style=\"padding-left: 0.375em;\"></a></h2> \n<p>Whilst building games, Hookkshot noticed it was taking a long time to deploy their builds to Discord. Many game creators often provide games to their pre-release and alpha testers to gather their feedback. Discord is a great platform for doing this. So when it takes a long time to deploy to Discord, that means a long time for people to wait. This is why Hookkshot wanted to build his GitHub Action: <a href=\"https://github.com/marketplace/actions/discord-dispatch-deploy\">discord-dispatch-deploy</a>:</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>We could build our application but couldn’t deploy it to the Discord servers. I asked around and no one has done one, so I thought, “hey, why don’t I be the one”. This way I could contribute to the community as well.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>Hookkshot’s Action does exactly what it sounds like: deploys a single application to Discord using Dispatch. This means Hookkshot and the team can get their games in the hands of testers and receive feedback in a shorter time frame.</p> \n<p>This isn’t the end either. Hookkshot’s Action is currently in alpha and he has plans to extend it:</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>We want to extend it to a full release with more features for configuring the build and options when the deploy happens. We may make a version 2 if we feel it could be useful as well.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<div id=\"attachment_54010\" style=\"width: 1930px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n <img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-54010\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-54010 size-full\" src=\"https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/code.png?resize=1920%2C1080\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" srcset=\"https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/code.png?resize=1920%2C1080?w=1920 1920w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/code.png?resize=1920%2C1080?w=300 300w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/code.png?resize=1920%2C1080?w=768 768w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/code.png?resize=1920%2C1080?w=1024 1024w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/code.png?resize=1920%2C1080?w=1536 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" />\n <p id=\"caption-attachment-54010\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Check out how the code works and get a sneak peak at one of Hookkshot’s games.</p>\n</div> \n<h2 id=\"challenges-and-learnings\">Challenges and learnings<a href=\"https://github.blog/?p=54002#challenges-and-learnings\" class=\"heading-link\" aria-label=\"Challenges and learnings\" data-anchorjs-icon=\"#\" style=\"padding-left: 0.375em;\"></a></h2> \n<p>One of Hookkshot’s favourite features of GitHub Actions is how fun and easy they are. He believes Actions have made CI and deployment fun and have “given so much time back to develop the game”. This is one of the best things about Actions. Putting power into the hands of developers so you have more time to do the things you love.</p> \n<p>But no good thing comes without a few challenges. Hookkshot says learning <a href=\"https://github.blog/changelog/2020-08-07-github-actions-composite-run-steps\">docker</a> and how it interacts with Actions is definitely a challenge:</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>There was a few speed bumps and tumbles but it got there in the end. The hardest part was having quick and reliable installed dependencies to the docker image for Dispatch to run.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>Learning can also be fun though! Hookkshot says this whole process has been a great learning experience:</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>I think the biggest thing I learned was the power of things like docker images to deploy and run code in a separate environment. It has been a great process.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<h2 id=\"get-started-with-github-actions\">Get started with GitHub Actions<a href=\"https://github.blog/?p=54002#get-started-with-github-actions\" class=\"heading-link\" aria-label=\"Get started with GitHub Actions\" data-anchorjs-icon=\"#\" style=\"padding-left: 0.375em;\"></a></h2> \n<p>If you were inspired by Keirron’s story, get started with GitHub Actions.

The reality is that these practices share a lot of the same principles—to reduce the time developers need to spend on security, while achieving better outcomes. And who doesn’t want that? Let’s clear up some confusion and deconstruct what these terms mean, and how they apply to your security and development teams.</span></p> \n<h3 id=\"what-is-devsecops-applying-devops-principles-to-security\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">What is DevSecOps: Applying DevOps principles to security</span><a href=\"https://github.blog/?p=53953#what-is-devsecops-applying-devops-principles-to-security\" class=\"heading-link\" aria-label=\"<span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;>What is DevSecOps: Applying DevOps principles to security</span>\" data-anchorjs-icon=\"#\" style=\"padding-left: 0.375em;\"></a></h3> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">DevOps is an increasingly popular trend in recent years—a shift that makes developers more accountable for operational issues. The idea is that when a system goes down, it’s everyone’s responsibility to fix it. And so is preventing outages to begin with. Rather than separating development and operations, DevOps posits that the responsibility for these functions is joint, between all parties that write, ship, and manage that code.</span></p> \n<p><b>The same mindset shift you’ve seen in the industry generally with a move towards DevOps has also been felt within security specifically. It’s commonly called </b><b><i>DevSecOps</i></b><b>.</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> This is about making all parties who are part of the application development lifecycle accountable for the security of the application, just as they are accountable for operations and supportability.</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">So what’s the difference between DevOps and DevSecOps? In the first, everyone becomes accountable for outages, even if they don’t manage the infrastructure. In the second, everyone becomes accountable for vulnerabilities, even if they didn’t write the software. Just like the business goal of DevOps is fewer outages, the business goal of DevSecOps is no data loss (which is also aided by fewer outages—availability is part of the </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_security#Key_concepts\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">CIA triad</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, after all). DevSecOps addresses the concern of development teams not satisfactorily addressing security requirements.</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Not everyone likes the term DevSecOps, though. And it’s not just because the order is confusing, but because it makes security seem special. The reality is every function should be tightly integrated this way, at every step in the development process. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Continuous security</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> draws a parallel to continuous integration and continuous delivery: you should continuously integrate security into your development process as well.</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Since this is a mindset shift, there’s no canonical list of practices, but rather the principal change is to apply security practices earlier in the development lifecycle.</span></p> \n<h3 id=\"practicing-devsecops-shifting-left-allows-development-teams-to-implement-controls-earlier-including-security-controls\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Practicing DevSecOps: Shifting left allows development teams to implement controls earlier, including security controls</span><a href=\"https://github.blog/?p=53953#practicing-devsecops-shifting-left-allows-development-teams-to-implement-controls-earlier-including-security-controls\" class=\"heading-link\" aria-label=\"<span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;>Practicing DevSecOps: Shifting left allows development teams to implement controls earlier, including security controls</span>\" data-anchorjs-icon=\"#\" style=\"padding-left: 0.375em;\"></a></h3> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In practice, to hold teams accountable for what they develop, processes need to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">shift left</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> to earlier in the development lifecycle, where development teams are. By moving steps like testing, including security testing, from a final gate at deployment time to an earlier step, fewer mistakes are made, and developers can move more quickly.</span></p> \n<p><b>The principles of shifting left also apply to security, not only to operations.</b> <b>It’s critical to prevent breaches before they can affect users, and to move quickly to address newly discovered security vulnerabilities and fix them</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. Instead of security acting as a gate, integrating it into every step of the development lifecycle allows your development team to catch issues earlier. A developer-centric approach means they can stay in context and respond to issues as they code, not days later at deployment, or months later from a penetration test report.</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Shifting left is a process change, but it isn’t a single control or specific tool—it’s about making all of security more developer-centric, and giving developers security feedback where they are. In practice, developers work with code and in Git, so as a result, we’re seeing more security controls being applied in Git.</span></p> \n<h3 id=\"managing-security-controls-consistently-gitops-uses-git-as-a-source-of-truth-for-your-environment\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Managing security controls consistently: GitOps uses Git as a source of truth for your environment</span><a href=\"https://github.blog/?p=53953#managing-security-controls-consistently-gitops-uses-git-as-a-source-of-truth-for-your-environment\" class=\"heading-link\" aria-label=\"<span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;>Managing security controls consistently: GitOps uses Git as a source of truth for your environment</span>\" data-anchorjs-icon=\"#\" style=\"padding-left: 0.375em;\"></a></h3> \n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">GitOps</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> capitalizes (literally) on the trend of thinking about everything in your environment as code. Sure, GitOps is infrastructure as code. But it’s also configuration as code, policy as code, and anything else you can think of as code. (Well, not anything. Don’t keep secrets in code. You thought your secrets were safe? You were wrong.)</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In contrast to DevSecOps and shifting left, which are mindset and process changes, GitOps is more prescriptive in terms of its implementation. GitOps is the system of using Git as a source of truth for your environment, and using properties of Git like history and review tools to manage how you make changes to that source of truth.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It’s also what you built on top of your code, to make deployments as automated and error-free as possible. With GitOps, you can push a change to code and review the change as part of your Git workflow, and then use automation to do all the hard stuff of deploying, monitoring, and adjusting live changes in production.</span></p> \n<p><b>GitOps is the system that best supports the ideals laid out in DevOps, and specifically in DevSecOps. </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It allows you to separate deployments from development, so you can deploy as often as you want. We know from the </span><a href=\"https://www.devops-research.com/research.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">DORA State of DevOps reports</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> that developers can move faster when they have version control, continuous integration, test automation, and other tooling that’s available with Git.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In DevOps, this matters specifically with mean time to recovery (MTTR) to respond after an outage. In DevSecOps, this matters with mean time to remediate (conveniently, also MTTR). Having version control means you know what’s in your environment: you know if you need to upgrade, and if you’re susceptible to a vulnerability. Having sufficient testing in place means you can very quickly deploy a fix, like a patch, knowing it won’t break your infrastructure.</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">By using Git, you have a single source of truth for your infrastructure, configurations, and applications. And by extension, a single process to make changes. You can implement necessary controls and gates on this process to make sure you meet any security needs you have for your development pipeline, and having a consistent development process allows you to shift left by verifying security requirements earlier, at code (or config) check-in, or build time, not just deployment time.</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">To summarize, DevSecOps is the mindset shift to recognize and continuously apply security practices as part of the development lifecycle, with responsibilities shared across teams. This is frequently accompanied by shifting security testing left to earlier in the lifecycle as part of development. This keeps security—and developers—in the flow and in context, allowing security issues to be addressed earlier. And, by using Git as a source of truth for your environment, you can more easily apply these principles not only to your code, but also to everything </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">around</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> your code, like your configurations. There’s no one way to apply these concepts, but rather, they are acknowledgement that security is an increasingly important and integral part of your development workflow today.</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">By empowering all developers to take responsibility for security, performing security testing earlier in your development lifecycle, and using Git, you can help your development teams find and remediate security issues faster. In future blog posts, we’ll also break down what this means for your first and third-party code.</span></p> \n<hr /> \n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Looking for more easy ways to keep your code secure?

We spoke to some of the coolest developers building the latest workflows and automations. Last week, we shared <a href=\"https://github.blog/2020-07-31-github-action-hero-swechhya-bista/\">Swechhya’s story</a>. This week we have <a href=\"https://github.com/katungi\">Daniel Dennis</a>. He also participated in our recent <a href=\"https://github.blog/2020-04-09-featured-actions-from-the-github-actions-hackathon/\">GitHub Actions Hackathon</a>. Read his story for inspiration, future plans, favourite features, and more.</p> \n<h2 id=\"passionate-developers\">Passionate Developers<a href=\"https://github.blog/?p=53910#passionate-developers\" class=\"heading-link\" aria-label=\"Passionate Developers\" data-anchorjs-icon=\"#\" style=\"padding-left: 0.375em;\"></a></h2> \n<p>Like many developers, Daniel is very passionate about what he does. He loves to build cool things and comes to us from Kenya. Before heading to university, Daniel started a software development course following a high school boot camp. That’s where he learned android development using Java, and web development using PHP. He soon branched out to Flutter, NodeJS, Ruby, and loves open source too. Daniel says one of his favourite places to learn is online through courses and YouTube videos.</p> \n<p>After learning Ruby, a lot of Daniel’s GitHub projects are built using Ruby on Rails. This is where he came up with the inspiration for his Action – <a href=\"https://github.com/katungi/Ruby-Gemer\">Ruby Gemer</a>:</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>Before I knew about <a href=\"https://github.blog/changelog/2020-07-15-assign-a-github-team-to-review-dependabot-pull-requests\">Dependabot</a> and how it works, I got emails whenever a gem was updated. More often than not, this would clutter. I created Gemer so that I could stay up to date with my gems with every push and also, keep my application secure even in production. I also wanted to test my code and check whether future updates would break my code.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<h2 id=\"ruby-gemer-and-future-plans\">Ruby Gemer and future plans<a href=\"https://github.blog/?p=53910#ruby-gemer-and-future-plans\" class=\"heading-link\" aria-label=\"Ruby Gemer and future plans\" data-anchorjs-icon=\"#\" style=\"padding-left: 0.375em;\"></a></h2> \n<p>Daniel’s Action allows you to keep track of those pesky emails and understand what gems are updated. It runs with the latest version of Ruby and is really easy to use.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-53911 size-large\" src=\"https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/setupworkflow.png?w=1024&amp;resize=1024%2C576\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" srcset=\"https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/setupworkflow.png?w=1281 1281w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/setupworkflow.png?w=300 300w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/setupworkflow.png?w=768 768w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/setupworkflow.png?w=1024&amp;resize=1024%2C576 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p> \n<p>Since Daniel seems to have a great affinity for Ruby, he’s looking at improving this Ruby powered Action:</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>I plan on adding more testing capabilities for Ruby developers. I also hope that the action will be well accepted within the Ruby community as they continue to make the action grow to serve everyone.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<h2 id=\"lessons-and-challenges-from-github-actions\">Lessons and challenges from GitHub Actions<a href=\"https://github.blog/?p=53910#lessons-and-challenges-from-github-actions\" class=\"heading-link\" aria-label=\"Lessons and challenges from GitHub Actions\" data-anchorjs-icon=\"#\" style=\"padding-left: 0.375em;\"></a></h2> \n<p>Daniel says he loves GitHub Actions because they are so easy to use and install. Like one of our previous <a href=\"https://github.blog/2020-07-17-github-action-hero-nikita-sobolev/\">Action heroes Nikita</a>, Daniel says it’s so simple to get started:</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>I love GitHub Actions because they are very easy to install. I love the idea that all I need to do is go to the market and I can get free tools to suit all my needs in development and production.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>Simplicity is great, but there’s also lessons to be learned and challenges to overcome. Daniel says when building GitHub Actions, his biggest challenge was yaml:</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>The biggest challenge for me was learning the workings of yaml and how to create a GitHub action with minimal documentation on how to do so. It took me a while figure it out, [but] the experience was amazing… When I started, I figured everything would be easy to do since it was only yaml. Getting the Action to work took me days of debugging. It was a good learning opportunity in the long run.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>Now that GitHub Actions has been around for a while, there is tonnes of great documentation available. You can check it out over on the <a href=\"https://github.community/search?q=actions\">community forums</a>.</p> \n<h2 id=\"get-involved\">Get involved<a href=\"https://github.blog/?p=53910#get-involved\" class=\"heading-link\" aria-label=\"Get involved\" data-anchorjs-icon=\"#\" style=\"padding-left: 0.375em;\"></a></h2> \n<p>The GitHub Actions Hackathon was Daniel’s first virtual hackathon, and he’s definitely keen to participate again. We’ll be running another GitHub Actions Hackathon very soon, so keep an eye on our blog and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/github\">socials</a>.</p> \n<p>We hope you enjoyed our interview with Daniel Dennis.

To demonstrate that a vulnerability is present, and to show the risk of exploiting it, we often end up running a piece of software on the remote system that is a part of our framework. Because it might run in a variety of environments, this software can’t rely on the presence of any third-party libraries or even modern operating system environments. This often requires us to put in a lot of effort into maintaining compatibility, and security features are no exception to that.</p> \n<h2 id=\"metasploit-makes-it-easier-to-find-and-fix-your-applications-vulnerabilities-specifically-exploitable-ones-why-is-this-important-and-how-does-metasploit-help-the-developer-community\">Metasploit makes it easier to find and fix your application’s vulnerabilities, specifically exploitable ones. Why is this important, and how does Metasploit help the developer community?&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.blog/?p=53985#metasploit-makes-it-easier-to-find-and-fix-your-applications-vulnerabilities-specifically-exploitable-ones-why-is-this-important-and-how-does-metasploit-help-the-developer-community\" class=\"heading-link\" aria-label=\"Metasploit makes it easier to find and fix your application’s vulnerabilities, specifically exploitable ones. Why is this important, and how does Metasploit help the developer community?&nbsp;\" data-anchorjs-icon=\"#\" style=\"padding-left: 0.375em;\"></a></h2> \n<p>The Metasploit Framework gives users and organizations of all sizes free and open access to attacker capabilities and enables them to test and demonstrate vulnerabilities. This helps organizations to better understand which vulnerabilities are exploitable within their environment, and thus focus their remediation efforts where they’ll have the highest impact. For developers specifically, there’s a growing trend in using complex infrastructure as part of the software development lifecycle (SDLC). The Metasploit Framework can be used as part of a CI/CD pipeline to test for common security vulnerabilities as part of existing development infrastructure, allowing developers to more confidently ensure the integrity of their projects.</p> \n<h2 id=\"what-advice-would-you-give-developers-on-how-to-best-improve-the-security-of-their-open-source-projects\">What advice would you give developers on how to best improve the security of their open source projects?<a href=\"https://github.blog/?p=53985#what-advice-would-you-give-developers-on-how-to-best-improve-the-security-of-their-open-source-projects\" class=\"heading-link\" aria-label=\"What advice would you give developers on how to best improve the security of their open source projects?\" data-anchorjs-icon=\"#\" style=\"padding-left: 0.375em;\"></a></h2> \n<p>Make reasonable efforts to limit the number of dependencies and select the ones that are used carefully.

We&#8217;ve started to adopt them within the mobile team here at GitHub, documenting decisions that affect the iOS codebase and Android codebase, as well as decisions that affect both mobile clients.</p>\n<p>ADRs are not the most common within open source codebases, but have gained more popularity <a href=\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/lightweight-architecture-decision-records\" rel=\"nofollow\">since ~2017 within long-lived, &#8220;evolutionary&#8221; codebases</a> like those in more enterprise-y settings.</p>\n<p>So why write an ADR? Why spend time documenting something when a decision has already been made?</p>\n<h2><a id=\"user-content-theyre-not-for-you-theyre-for-future-you\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://github.com/github/blog/blob/32a963b224bada16b77eac114f531aa0069ecc00/_posts/2020/2020-08-04-why-write-adrs.md#theyre-not-for-you-theyre-for-future-you\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a>They&#8217;re not for you, they&#8217;re for future you</h2>\n<p>ADRs are not meant to be a self-discovery, reflection process on what you decided. ADRs will help you 6-12 months from now recall what your mindset was when you decided upon that architecture.</p>\n<p><strong>ADRs capture the decision at the time it&#8217;s being made.</strong> ADRs are the culmination of all those minutes and hours you spent in meetings, on Zoom, in Slack, or jamming through various proof-of-concepts in Xcode. All of the context that&#8217;s in your head has a chance to get out into words so that when you&#8217;re revisiting the architecture down the road, you can put that context right back into your head.</p>\n<p>The real bonus comes when someone <code>git blame</code>s you some months from now and asks you how the <code>GitHubAPIClient</code> module works. Better than setting up a 30-minute pairing call to walk them through the code, you can now link to the ADR you wrote to explain some more about the decisions made while building the <code>GitHubAPIClient</code> module.</p>\n<h2><a id=\"user-content-theyre-not-for-you-theyre-for-your-peers\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://github.com/github/blog/blob/32a963b224bada16b77eac114f531aa0069ecc00/_posts/2020/2020-08-04-why-write-adrs.md#theyre-not-for-you-theyre-for-your-peers\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a>They&#8217;re not for you, they&#8217;re for your peers</h2>\n<p>ADRs force you to write more than a one-liner &#8220;this ships the feature for #3128&#8221;. They are a longer form of prose to help your teammates understand why the feature is built the way it is, and not built some other way (see: &#8220;Alternatives Considered&#8221; and &#8220;Pros/Cons&#8221; within ADRs themselves).</p>\n<p>Something that may be simple for you might be complicated for your teammates. Taking the time to write down what your thought process was as you made decisions gives your teammates the chance to get inside your head. Writing ADRs allows for <a href=\"https://www.ozimmer.ch/practices/2020/05/22/ADDefinitionOfDone.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">“decision socialization”</a>, where your <em>team</em> comes to a decision that the <em>team</em> is responsible for maintaining, rather than decisions made in isolation.</p>\n<p>By <em>expanding</em> upon what you write in your pull request titles and descriptions (and you are still writing quality pull request descriptions, right?), <strong>you give your teammates more information about how a patch or diff works in a larger system.</strong></p>\n<p>Better yet, by writing an ADR <em>ahead</em> of putting your pull requests up, you&#8217;ll get better pull request reviews from the team reviewing it. No longer do you need to explain how line 387 in <code>APIClient+Caching.swift</code> will affect data fetching and caching architecture, because your teammates already understand how you&#8217;re changing the system from the ADR you wrote about &#8220;Adding cache support to <code>E-Tag</code> entities&#8221;.</p>\n<h2><a id=\"user-content-theyre-not-for-you-theyre-for-your-future-peers\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://github.com/github/blog/blob/32a963b224bada16b77eac114f531aa0069ecc00/_posts/2020/2020-08-04-why-write-adrs.md#theyre-not-for-you-theyre-for-your-future-peers\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a>They&#8217;re not for you, they&#8217;re for your future peers</h2>\n<p>ADRs are not meant you to show off how smart you are or for folks to fawn over the architecture you built. ADRs <em>are</em> for helping onboard new teammates as they work to understand the codebase and how it has evolved over time.</p>\n<p>As teams scale and grow, the number of lines of communication between teammates increases. A team of three individuals only has three lines of communication (<code>A &#60;&#62; B</code>, <code>A &#60;&#62; C</code>, <code>B &#60;&#62; C</code>). A team of four has six (<code>A &#60;&#62; B</code>, <code>A &#60;&#62; C</code>, <code>A &#60;&#62; D</code>, <code>B &#60;&#62; C</code>, <code>B &#60;&#62; D</code>, <code>C &#60;&#62; D</code>). Wanna do the math for a team of five or six? How about 14 engineers, two designers, two PMs, and three EMs?</p>\n<p>Writing down decisions made helps communicate to your current teammates, but also those who join your team as it scales and grows. <strong>By informing your team how and why a decision was made in an asynchronous fashion, you no longer need to &#8220;hop on a Zoom call&#8221; to onboard each new teammate on a per-architectural-decision basis.</strong></p>\n<p>In the best-case scenario, you&#8217;ll have your teammates writing new ADRs for <em>you</em>, <a href=\"https://understandlegacycode.com/blog/earn-maintainers-esteem-with-adrs/#revisit-a-past-decision--a-new-adr\" rel=\"nofollow\">superseding the decisions</a> past you made, so that you can learn from your teammates in the future.</p>\n<h2><a id=\"user-content-write-more-adrs\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://github.com/github/blog/blob/32a963b224bada16b77eac114f531aa0069ecc00/_posts/2020/2020-08-04-why-write-adrs.md#write-more-adrs\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a>Write more ADRs</h2>\n<p>I hope this has convinced you to document the decisions that you&#8217;re making as we build software that (hopefully) millions of folks use!
