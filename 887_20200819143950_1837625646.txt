Video as a medium has become one of the most effective ways to stand out and connect with an audience. Video quickly conveys meaning and emotion. It’s memorable, and it catches the eye in a sea of text and static images.</p>\n<p>To hit home the growing popularity of video: Over one billion people use Youtube (that’s almost one third of all people on the internet), and the number of daily Youtube viewers has increased 40 percent since March 2014.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, many social media sites like Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook have integrated some form of video content on their platforms. Additionally, new social media platforms have recently emerged that feature video as the central medium for interaction.</p>\n<p>More and more, brands are recognizing the value of video as an online marketing strategy. <a href=\"http://www.demandmetric.com/content/video-marketing-benchmark-report-0\" target=\"_blank\">Demand Metric</a> completed a survey of 398 marketing, sales, and business professionals which revealed that 69 percent have used video marketing and another 31 percent are planning to. A recent study of 200 executives by <a href=\"https://www.yourbrandlive.com/press/new-research-reveals-power-of-live-streaming-video-for-brands\" target=\"_blank\">Brandlive</a> found that 44 percent held a live streaming event in 2015 and 39 percent believe live streaming video will be important to their marketing efforts going forward.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a class=\"callforaction\" href=\"https://goo.gl/TQj0XN\" target=\"new\">Learn more about Social Selling and feedly</a></p>\n<p>The video trend is growing alongside the surging smartphone use trend, as more and more people use phone cameras. Daily mobile internet usage continues to grow year by year, on a global scale. Of all mobile traffic, online video now accounts for upwards of 50 percent.</p>\n<p>The prevalence of both video and smartphones have paved the way for newer social platforms centered around live streaming video, like Periscope, Meerkat, and now Blab.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-7873\"></span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://blab.im/\" target=\"_blank\">Blab.im</a> (which is still in beta) is quickly growing in popularity. As a platform that is truly social, interactive, informational, and fun, Blab is certainly worth getting acquainted with for its many potential uses as a tool for business and marketing.</p>\n<p>Since Blab is one of the newest of the live video trend, let&#8217;s take a closer look.</p>\n<h2>What Is Blab?</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://Blab.im\" target=\"_blank\">Blab.im</a> is a live video broadcasting platform for hosting, watching, and joining conversations.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_7891\" style=\"width: 793px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-7891\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-7891 size-full\" src=\"http://blog1.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/screen-shot-2016-04-04-at-4-35-45-pm.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2016-04-04 at 4.35.45 PM\" width=\"783\" height=\"522\" srcset=\"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/screen-shot-2016-04-04-at-4-35-45-pm.png 783w, https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/screen-shot-2016-04-04-at-4-35-45-pm-300x200.png 300w, https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/screen-shot-2016-04-04-at-4-35-45-pm-768x512.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 783px) 100vw, 783px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-7891\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">THis is a caption</p></div></p>\n<p>Image source: https://blab.im/about</p>\n<p>While many have likened it to &#8220;Periscope for groups,” you can also think of it as a cross between a talk show and a webinar. It can be used for either of those things as well as casual hang outs, debates, discussions, and workshops. There is nothing quite like it on the market, although it incorporates the best components of several different social media platforms.</p>\n<p>Anyone can host their own Blab. It’s available for anyone to watch and interact with. No professional equipment is necessary.</p>\n<p>Blab supports two to four “presenters&#8221; at a time, displayed in a grid, à la Brady Bunch. Meanwhile, other participants can watch the conversation live on video while adding to the discussion and posing questions via text chat. The host can even pull in audience members into the “hot seat” on the live video chat from time to time, if they so choose.</p>\n<p>After the chat wraps up, the conversation can be re-watched on Blab, and the hosts have the option to post the recording to Youtube or embed it on their own site.</p>\n<h2>Industry</h2>\n<p>Blab.im primarily seems to be used by solopreneurs and online thought leaders, discussing topics that range from sports to politics to social media trends.</p>\n<p>Blab is also ripe for online marketers and sales departments in just about any industry. It’s ideal for brands that want to give their customers a chance to interact in a personal way, visually demonstrate the value of their product or service, or establish their brand&#8217;s expertise and thought leadership. Granted, a direct sales pitch or advertisement won’t fly on this platform. But the interactive and visual nature of Blab opens doors to a number of benefits for businesses.</p>\n<h2>Why Blab Could Change Your Business</h2>\n<p>Blab can be used for a number of valuable business functions. It shortens the distance between you and your customer and opens up a new realm of in-the-moment experiences to create. From an online marketing standpoint, it’s a great platform for developing authentic and personalized connections with clients because it is live and unpolished. Showing, rather than just telling, and being able to answer customer concerns on the spot goes a long way in developing trust and loyalty.</p>\n<p>Here are some examples of a variety of ways Blab can be used for business:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Unveil new products with live demonstrations.</li>\n<li>Provide group coaching sessions.</li>\n<li>Conduct a Q&#38;A session or office hours.</li>\n<li>Demonstrate expertise by providing useful info for your audience.</li>\n<li>Demonstrate transparency by answering tough customer questions.</li>\n<li>Discuss strategy with your peers.</li>\n<li>Give a behind-the-scenes experience to your tribe.</li>\n<li>Network with your target audience by being a participant in other shows.</li>\n<li>Brainstorm ideas with your audience, almost like a focus group.</li>\n<li>Get feedback on changes you’ve implemented or ideas you’re considering.</li>\n<li>Record and re-use a Blab conversation as a podcast or blog post.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Learn More</h2>\n<p>Blab.im is still in beta, so the best way to get acquainted with it is to watch shows by folks who have proven success on the platform. Here are a few to get you started:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://blab.im/bryankramer\" target=\"_blank\">Bryan Kramer</a> &#8211; CEO of PureMatter</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://blab.im/kimgarst\" target=\"_blank\">Kim Garst</a> &#8211; Social selling strategist</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://blab.im/iSocialFanz\" target=\"_blank\">Brian Fanzo</a> &#8211; Digital live streaming strategist</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now is the perfect time to jump on Blab and increase your brand’s visibility while the competition is slim.

Today, we are excited to launch the result of that work. You can download the new app for free on the App Store and Google Play.</p>\n<section class=\"webfeeds-actions\">\n<div class=\"webfeeds-group-buttons\"><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/feedly-your-work-newsfeed/id396069556?mt=8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://s3.feedly.com/production/head/images/apps/apple-store-badge@2x.png\" /></a><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.devhd.feedly\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://s3.feedly.com/production/head/images/apps/google-play-badge@2x.png\" /></a></div>\n</section>\n<p>Here is a quick tour of the new design.</p>\n<h2>Faster and more intuitive design</h2>\n<p>We love the Web because it is an open and distributed network that offers everyone the freedom and control to publish and follow what matters to them. The essence of this new design is to give you even more control over the information you follow and consume in your Feedly and make that experience more productive.</p>\n<figure class=\"webfeeds-frame-simple webfeeds-size-large\"><img src=\"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/new-design.gif\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Both on iOS and Android, we adopted more modern UI practices that make the experience feel lighter and easier to read. We also added more layout and density options so that user can pick the reading experience that best fits their preferences.</p>\n<h2>Powerful mark as read and save gestures</h2>\n<p>We learned from the Lab that marking as read and saving for later are key parts of our users’ workflows so we added some gestures to make those actions easier and faster to perform.</p>\n<figure class=\"webfeeds-frame-simple webfeeds-size-large\"><img src=\"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/gestures.gif\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<p>You can swipe left or right to trigger mark as read and save actions. You can long press to trigger a contextual menu which offers you even more actions and shortcuts.</p>\n<figure class=\"webfeeds-frame-simple webfeeds-size-large\"><img src=\"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screenshot-2018-12-01-14.43.09.png\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<p>In the global settings, you will also find an option to automatically mark stories as read as you scroll through your feeds.</p>\n<h2>Night Mode</h2>\n<p>Some of you really love to read Feedly at night, or you prefer to read in night mode all day. In the new Feedly app, we polished <a href=\"https://blog.feedly.com/experiment-05-night-mode/\">Night Mode</a> so that you can easily read in low-light environments.</p>\n<figure class=\"webfeeds-frame-simple webfeeds-size-large\"><img src=\"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screenshot-2018-12-01-14.49.22.png\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<h2>New AI-driven discovery experience</h2>\n<p>We also love the web, because it has enabled a new generation of content creators like <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/\">Ben Thompson</a>, <a href=\"https://www.schneier.com/\">Bruce Schneier</a>, <a href=\"https://www.swiss-miss.com/\">Tina Eisenberg</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sethgodin.com/\">Seth Godin</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/\">Maria Popova</a>. These independent thinkers continuously explore the edge of the known and share insightful and inspiring ideas with their communities.</p>\n<p>Connecting people to the best sources for the topics that matter to them has been core to our mission since the very start of Feedly, but discovery is a hard problem. The web is organic, a reflection of the global community’s changing needs and priorities. There are millions of sources across thousands of topics, and we all have a different appetite when it comes to feeding our minds.</p>\n<figure class=\"webfeeds-frame-simple webfeeds-size-large\"><img src=\"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/discovery.gif\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<p>As part of this next generation Feedly mobile app, we are launching <a href=\"https://blog.feedly.com/experience-06-discovery-and-the-web/\">a new AI-driven discovery experience</a> which puts the top 50 most interesting sources across 2,000 topics at your fingertips.</p>\n<h2>Power Search</h2>\n<p>Power Search allows you to quickly find specific articles in your Feedly. This powerful search is one of the most-cited reasons for upgrading to Feedly Pro in user surveys. We are excited to bring Power Search to mobile.</p>\n<figure class=\"webfeeds-frame-simple webfeeds-size-large\"><img src=\"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/powersearch.png\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<h2>Notes and highlights</h2>\n<p>The new notes and highlights tools make it easy to annotate articles with your insights, save them for reference, or share them with your colleagues, friends, and followers.</p>\n<figure class=\"webfeeds-frame-simple webfeeds-size-large\"><img src=\"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/annotations.png\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<h2>Feedly Teams</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://feedly.com/i/landing/team\">Feedly Teams</a> allows you to make your industry research, competitive watch, and content curation a more fun and collaborative experience. With the new Feedly mobile app, you can now access all your team feeds, team boards, newsletters, and shared annotations on your phone and tablet.</p>\n<figure class=\"webfeeds-frame-simple webfeeds-size-large\"><img src=\"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/teams.png\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<p>There are more than 7,000 teams relying on Feedly for their research and curation. We hope that the new mobile offering will inspire more users to take advantage of <a href=\"https://feedly.com/i/landing/team\">the free Feedly Team 30-day trial</a>.</p>\n<h2>New Pocket integration</h2>\n<p>If you are a Pocket user, you can connect Feedly to Pocket and replace Read Later with Pocket across the user experience.</p>\n<figure class=\"webfeeds-frame-simple webfeeds-size-large\"><img src=\"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screenshot-2018-11-30-16.16.13.png\" /></figure>\n<h2>New Codebase</h2>\n<p>We have entirely re-implemented the application on a new technology stack.  With a new, modern foundation in place, we are able to iterate faster. For those who are curious, the new app is built using Streets microservices, React for the UI components, and some native extensions when needed.</p>\n<h2>Built collaboratively with 4,000 Feedly users</h2>\n<p>We really enjoyed building the new Feedly in close collaboration with 4,000 Feedly users who volunteered time, expertise, and energy. Your ideas, feedback, and bug reports were critical to the success of the redesign. You’ve helped make Feedly better for everyone.</p>\n<figure class=\"webfeeds-frame-simple webfeeds-size-large\"><img src=\"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screenshot-2018-12-01-15.00.32.png\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<p>We are going to double down on this more collaborative and transparent dev process. You can <a href=\"https://blog.feedly.com/slack-community/\">join the Dev Team and Lab community</a> on Slack and you can <a href=\"https://trello.com/b/bPZDVlwx/feedly-mobileai-lab\">view the roadmap</a> and <a href=\"https://trello.com/b/bPZDVlwx/feedly-mobileai-lab\">upvote features on Trello</a>.</p>\n<p>Finally, if for some reason you prefer the old design, you can look for &#8220;Feedly Classic&#8221; in the App Store or Google Play.</p>\n<p>Happy reading!</p>\n<p>Edwin, Petr, and Emily</p>\n<section class=\"webfeeds-actions\">\n<div class=\"webfeeds-group-buttons\"><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/feedly-your-work-newsfeed/id396069556?mt=8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://s3.feedly.com/production/head/images/apps/apple-store-badge@2x.png\" /></a><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.devhd.feedly\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://s3.feedly.com/production/head/images/apps/google-play-badge@2x.png\" /></a></div>\n</section>\n                </div>\n            \n\n           ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 04 Dec 2018 18:22:42 +0000","feedId":887,"bgimg":"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/promo-1@2x.png","linkMd5":"f3c86e439fca23fc8677bd28c1176c0a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn20@2020_6/2020/08/19/14-37-17-308_ad63d63315f3f8df.webp","destWidth":5000,"destHeight":4000,"sourceBytes":10430781,"destBytes":520682,"author":"Edwin K","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/promo-1@2x.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn20@2020_6/2020/08/19/14-37-17-308_ad63d63315f3f8df.webp","https://s3.feedly.com/production/head/images/apps/apple-store-badge@2x.png":null,"https://s3.feedly.com/production/head/images/apps/google-play-badge@2x.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn22@2020_6/2020/08/19/14-37-19-500_50c70ed12bf3730b.webp","https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/new-design.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn93@2020_4/2020/08/19/14-38-13-032_63e92da700cd9608.webp","https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/gestures.gif":null,"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screenshot-2018-12-01-14.43.09.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn61@2020_4/2020/08/19/14-37-19-764_db424bd7dd064c32.webp","https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screenshot-2018-12-01-14.49.22.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn79@2020_3/2020/08/19/14-37-20-244_9e9de75cd304683a.webp","https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/discovery.gif":null,"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/powersearch.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn50@2020_3/2020/08/19/14-37-20-641_e259cedc891c2c61.webp","https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/annotations.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn1@2020_6/2020/08/19/14-37-19-820_e412f190be304803.webp","https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/teams.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn87@2020_3/2020/08/19/14-37-19-864_0307cd88e54b4c1f.webp","https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screenshot-2018-11-30-16.16.13.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn71@2020_2/2020/08/19/14-37-19-729_b9914eb1712dfffb.webp","https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screenshot-2018-12-01-15.00.32.png":null},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1597847828456},{"createdTime":"2020-08-19 22:37:08","updatedTime":"2020-08-19 22:37:08","title":"Meet Shared Collections: Now you can choose to share what you read with others","link":"http://blog.feedly.com/?p=6847","description":"\n              \n                <div>\n                  <div class=\"webfeeds-header\">\n                      <img class=\"webfeeds-header__illustration webfeedsFeaturedVisual\" src=\"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/collection-sharing.png\" width=\"930\" height=\"480\" />                                        <div class=\"webfeeds-header__title\"><!-- injected by client --></div>\n                                      </div>\n                  <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a class=\"callforaction\" href=\"http://feedly.com/i/library\" target=\"new\">Try Shared Collections Now</a><a class=\"callforaction secondary\" href=\"http://blog.feedly.com/2015/09/01/tips-to-make-most-of-shared-collections\" target=\"new\">Read Tutorial</a></p>\n<p>At feedly, we believe at our core that knowledge is power, and thus content is empowering—and even more so when you share it!</p>\n<p>So we are excited to introduce today a new <a href=\"https://feedly.com/i/pro/blog-shared-collections\" target=\"_blank\">feedly Pro</a> feature we call <strong>Shared Collections</strong>—a new and highly requested tool that lets you choose to share what you read with your teammates, colleagues, and followings.</p>\n<p>With Shared Collections, you can take the collections of reading sources you’ve already created—or create a new collection for the purpose of sharing—and make them public on one shared collections page dedicated just for you or your team.

Over the past few weeks we have rethought the way you can clean up and reorganize your feedly. I worked with the feedly team to design two different concepts and would love to hear your feedback to help us build the best organized experience possible!</p>\n<p>In a recent survey with 5,000 participants, many of you showed us that you like to reorganize your feedly for two main reasons:</p>\n<p><strong>Spring cleaning<br />\n</strong>Every once in a while you need to clean up your feedly to make sure you only follow the feeds that interest you. This involves removing inactive feeds (the ones that have not published in months), removing the feeds you don’t read anymore, and promoting articles to “must-read” publications, so you don’t miss a story.</p>\n<p><strong>Reorganization<br />\n</strong>There are other times when you feel like reorganizing parts or all of your feedly. Maybe you have new interests or you want to split a topic into a few more specific topics, such as splitting your Marketing Collection into SEO and Digital Marketing Collections. All of this involves renaming Collections, moving them around and moving feeds from one Collection to another.</p>\n<p>After a few weeks of design work with these two use cases in mind, we came up with two design directions:</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-7439\"></span></p>\n<h2>Concept 1: Organize At a Glance</h2>\n<p>The main idea behind this concept is that everything is available in one page with just the crucial information you need to optimize your feedly. Your collections are listed on the right and the selected Collection’s feeds appear at the center of the page. This enables you to move from Collection to Collection without switching context.</p>\n<p>You can try out this concept on InVision: https://invis.io/D567GADVZ</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7455\" src=\"https://blog1.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/selected-design.png\" alt=\"Selected-Design\" width=\"1154\" height=\"641\" srcset=\"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/selected-design.png 1440w, https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/selected-design-300x167.png 300w, https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/selected-design-768x427.png 768w, https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/selected-design-1024x569.png 1024w, https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/selected-design-1200x667.png 1200w, https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/selected-design-800x444.png 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1154px) 100vw, 1154px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>View important information at a glance<br />\n</strong>With this first concept we are showing you the essential information you need when you need it, no less, no more. For instance, when looking at a Collection you will see the feeds that are Must Read and those which are inactive. It’s just enough information for you to take action with no clutter.</p>\n<p>Because your Collections are listed on the right side, you can easily navigate from one to the other rapidly.</p>\n<p><strong>Take the main actions in one click<br />\n</strong>Most actions are one click away or one drag away. Hit the cross or the star icon to remove a feed from a Collection or mark a feed as must read, respectively (see below for examples). Use drag and drop gestures to move a feed to the Collection it should belong to and re-order your Collections.</p>\n<p>_<br />\n<em>Making a feed must read</em></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-baskervillepostthumbnail wp-image-7459\" src=\"https://blog1.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/minimal-mustread.png?w=904\" alt=\"minimal-mustread\" width=\"904\" height=\"392\" srcset=\"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/minimal-mustread.png 904w, https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/minimal-mustread-300x130.png 300w, https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/minimal-mustread-768x333.png 768w, https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/minimal-mustread-800x347.png 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 904px) 100vw, 904px\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">_<br />\n<em>Moving a feeds to a different Collection</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-baskervillepostthumbnail wp-image-7458\" src=\"https://blog1.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/minimal-movefeed.png?w=904\" alt=\"minimal-movefeed\" width=\"904\" height=\"392\" srcset=\"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/minimal-movefeed.png 904w, https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/minimal-movefeed-300x130.png 300w, https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/minimal-movefeed-768x333.png 768w, https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/minimal-movefeed-800x347.png 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 904px) 100vw, 904px\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">_<br />\n<em>Reordering a Collection</em></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7457\" src=\"https://blog1.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/minimal-movecollection.png\" alt=\"minimal-movecollection\" width=\"904\" height=\"392\" srcset=\"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/minimal-movecollection.png 904w, https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/minimal-movecollection-300x130.png 300w, https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/minimal-movecollection-768x333.png 768w, https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/minimal-movecollection-800x347.png 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 904px) 100vw, 904px\" /></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h2>Concept 2: Organize with Deep Site Information</h2>\n<p>This second concept takes advantage of data tables and the feedly slider.

More servers </b><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">&#8211; The feedly cloud is connected to 42,000,000 feeds of information, receiving about 50,000,000 new stories every day. We are adding servers to the feedly Cloud to store, organize, and index all of this information so that we can continue to serve you feedly very fast.</span></p>\n<p><b><b><span style=\"color:#2bb24c;\"> </span></b>2.

We now have the resources to fund this project and make it a reality. We will continue to offer the ability to log in with Google, Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft, and Evernote to people who prefer to use existing logins. We are also adding support for logging in with Slack and Office 365, since we hear that it will make logging in even easier for some of our users.</span></p>\n<p><b>3. Shared tags </b><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">&#8211; When we released Shared Collections last month, some users asked us to go one step further and also allow them to share some of their tags. We really like this idea and are working on both continuing to enhance Shared Collections and adding shared tags.</span></p>\n<p><b>4. Filtering, saved search, and noise reduction</b><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> &#8211; We have been hearing a lot of murmurs from you around the need for filtering and for alerts. We are going to use part of the new Pro funding for a project that will allow you to define manual and automated filters. It will also allow you to save searches as alerts. We love the idea of giving you even more control over how to tailor your feedly. More signal, less noise.</span></p>\n<p><b>5. Better Slack integration</b><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> &#8211; We think that we can reduce some of the friction that exists around manually sharing stories from your feedly into your Slack channels. Many users are  using feedly and Slack in tandem, so we are going to invest some time enhancing the integration.</span></p>\n<p><b>6.

They seem related to loading web pages, videos, and animated gifs within feedly. We hate crashes as much as anyone else, and we are fixing this. We are investing time into a new update of the feedly iOS application which changes how we load content and minimizes the risk of the application crashing. We are also investing time optimizing how we serve content to minimize battery usage. You should see the fruits of this work in the v30 update of the app which should be available within a few weeks.</span></p>\n<p><b>7.

Ryan Cowdrey, of the young startup <a href=\"http://23Vivi.com\" target=\"_blank\">23VIVI.com</a>, shows us how you can use feedly to leverage content as an art curator. He provides a guest post for us today.</em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My name is Ryan Cowdrey and I’m the Director of Curation at <a href=\"http://23Vivi.com\" target=\"_blank\">23VIVI.com</a>, an online marketplace that offers rare and limited edition digital art. For your enjoyment, I pose the question:</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“With so much digital media content at one’s fingertips at all times, how does a creative individual discover the latest trends amongst all the noise out there?”</span></p></blockquote>\n<p>Being an art curator in the digital age requires strategic tools for effectively treading through the massive amount of content that we can access. Curators are relying more and more on internet sources to get content updates that they need on a daily basis. (Blouin ArtInfo, ArtNet News, Design Collector, Fubiz, BOMB Magazine, Colossal, to name a few.)</p>\n<p>Not to mention that if you curate digital art exclusively, you are now relying solely on internet sources to get your art fix. The tools that one uses to augment their curation efforts will set them apart from the rest.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-7808\"></span></p>\n<p>As a digital art curator at 23VIVI.com, I follow upwards of 30 big-time art magazines to stay up to date on art creation and news. After implementing feedly into my daily routine, I can now consume double the amount of content in less time.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a class=\"callforaction\" href=\"https://goo.gl/XsxunU\" target=\"new\">Get our <b>State of Content Marketing report</b></a></p>\n<p>Pre-feedly, I was literally using an Excel spreadsheet to keep track of all the magazines that I was visiting weekly. I would record what site I was visiting, the day I last checked it, and the title of the last article, so I could pick up where I left off. Sound like a hassle? IT WAS!!!</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7820\" src=\"http://blog1.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/screen-shot-2016-03-28-at-5-38-34-pm.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2016-03-28 at 5.38.34 PM\" width=\"1362\" height=\"744\" srcset=\"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/screen-shot-2016-03-28-at-5-38-34-pm.png 1362w, https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/screen-shot-2016-03-28-at-5-38-34-pm-300x164.png 300w, https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/screen-shot-2016-03-28-at-5-38-34-pm-768x420.png 768w, https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/screen-shot-2016-03-28-at-5-38-34-pm-1024x559.png 1024w, https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/screen-shot-2016-03-28-at-5-38-34-pm-1200x656.png 1200w, https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/screen-shot-2016-03-28-at-5-38-34-pm-800x437.png 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1362px) 100vw, 1362px\" /></p>\n<p>After being introduced to feedly, I honestly lost 10 pounds of stress. It was by far the easiest, most effective tool I use to augment my career. Not only do I follow those same magazines that I was already subscribing to, but I was exposed to countless other publications that feedly offers in my space… and now they are all in one place. Along with that, I did away with the email subscriptions, which were immensely cluttering my workflow. Not to mention, I don’t risk ever missing a single article or post, which is imperative to my profession.</p>\n<p>The typical curator goes to school to study Art History and might apprentice under a known curator until they have the skills to put on their own exhibitions.</p>\n<p>We are in a new era of digital art, though, that doesn’t require all the technical training. One has an Art History degree at their fingertips at most libraries. Many big-name curators can be followed on social media, where you can get a feel for their curation efforts.</p>\n<p>So, it ultimately comes down to getting your hands on lots of content, so that you can begin noticing trends, formulating hypotheses, and putting together thought-provoking collections.</p>\n<p>On my path to becoming a “curatorial expert,” I’m relying on feedly to feed my content needs—much like Indiana Jones relied on his whip—haha! To avoid limiting my hunger for creative ideas, I use feedly’s Collection feature to break up my content and feed into various categories: Photography, Physical Design, Graphic Design, Art News, Pop-Culture, and Visual Art. This allows me to not only keep things organized but also easily pull influences from various art mediums.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7819\" src=\"http://blog1.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/screen-shot-2016-03-28-at-1-23-41-am1.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2016-03-28 at 1.23.41 AM\" width=\"1356\" height=\"641\" srcset=\"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/screen-shot-2016-03-28-at-1-23-41-am1.png 1356w, https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/screen-shot-2016-03-28-at-1-23-41-am1-300x142.png 300w, https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/screen-shot-2016-03-28-at-1-23-41-am1-768x363.png 768w, https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/screen-shot-2016-03-28-at-1-23-41-am1-1024x484.png 1024w, https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/screen-shot-2016-03-28-at-1-23-41-am1-1200x567.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1356px) 100vw, 1356px\" /></p>\n<p>Because I swim through so much content on a daily basis, it is very easy to get lost in the immensity. To augment this problem I use the tag and “save for later” features to create collections of art that work well together. I can easily communicate with my team what my thoughts are on our newest curated collection and show what influences me.</p>\n<p>With feedly, anyone with an aptitude for creativity, noticing patterns, and expressing their thoughts through creation can become a digital art curator.</p>\n<p>Contributed by Ryan Cowdrey, Director of Curation at <a href=\"http://23VIVI.com\" target=\"_blank\">23VIVI.com</a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a class=\"callforaction\" href=\"https://goo.gl/XsxunU\" target=\"new\">Get our <b>State of Content Marketing report</b></a></p>\n                </div>\n            \n\n           ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 30 Mar 2016 14:00:59 +0000","feedId":887,"bgimg":"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/unnamed1.png","linkMd5":"05f8679b1edc739d3fadc513e3d44de3","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn38@2020_5/2020/08/19/14-37-09-812_948f09f5dbf4178e.webp","destWidth":2048,"destHeight":2048,"sourceBytes":4746530,"destBytes":378114,"author":"feedly","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/unnamed1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn38@2020_5/2020/08/19/14-37-09-812_948f09f5dbf4178e.webp","http://blog1.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/screen-shot-2016-03-28-at-5-38-34-pm.png":null,"http://blog1.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/screen-shot-2016-03-28-at-1-23-41-am1.png":null},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1597847828456},{"createdTime":"2020-08-19 22:37:08","updatedTime":"2020-08-19 22:37:08","title":"Safari Viewer, San Francisco and 3D touch – New feedly for iOS","link":"http://blog.feedly.com/?p=7099","description":"\n              \n                <div>\n                  <div class=\"webfeeds-header\">\n                                                            <div class=\"webfeeds-header__title\"><!-- injected by client --></div>\n                                      </div>\n                  <p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"visual alignnone wp-image-7100 size-full\" src=\"https://blog1.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screenshot-2015-10-21-09-00-08.png\" alt=\"feedly for iOS 9\" width=\"660\" height=\"448\" srcset=\"https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screenshot-2015-10-21-09-00-08.png 822w, https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screenshot-2015-10-21-09-00-08-300x204.png 300w, https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screenshot-2015-10-21-09-00-08-768x521.png 768w, https://blog.feedly.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screenshot-2015-10-21-09-00-08-800x543.png 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">The new feedly for iOS is available for download in the App Store.

You can keep using your current login credentials and not touch anything, if you wish.</p>\n<p><em>Q: What are the password rules?</em><br />\nYour password must be at least eight characters long. That’s it!</p>\n<p><em>Q: Does my password expire?</em><br />\nNo, it doesn’t expire.</p>\n<p><em>Q: I got an email to confirm my feedly email address. Do I have to click on the link?</em><br />\nThe short answer is yes. It’s a good idea to confirm your email because it will enable you to reset your password if you forget it.</p>\n<p><em>Q: Can I reset my password?</em><br />\nYes, if you forgot your password, you can reset it from the login page and we’ll send you instructions.
