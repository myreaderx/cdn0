Renal excretion of small particles is preferable over other clearance pathways to minimize potential toxicity. Thus, there is a significant demand to prepare ultra-small theranostic agents with renal clearance behaviors.</p><p><b>Method</b>: In this work, we report a facile method to prepare NPs with ultra-small size that show renal clearable behavior for imaging-guided photodynamic therapy (PDT). Pyropheophorbide-a (Pa), a deep red photosensitizer was functionalized with polyethylene glycol (PEG) to obtain Pa-PEG. The prepared NPs formed ultra-small nanodots in aqueous solution and showed red-shifted absorbance that enabling efficient singlet oxygen generation upon light irradiation.</p><p><b>Results</b>: <i>In vitro</i> studies revealed good photodynamic therapy (PDT) effect of these Pa-PEG nanodots. Most of the cancer cells incubated with Pa-PEG nanodots were destroyed after being exposed to the irradiated light. Utilizing the optical properties of such Pa-PEG nanodots, <i>in vivo</i> photoacoustic (PA) and fluorescence (FL) imaging techniques were used to assess the optimal time for PDT treatment after intravenous (i.v.) injection of the nanodots. As monitored by the PA/FL dual-modal imaging, the nanodots could accumulate at the tumor site and reach the maximum concentration at 8 h post injection. Finally, the tumors on mice treated with Pa-PEG nanodots were effectively inhibited by PDT treatment. Moreover, Pa-PEG nanodots showed high PA/FL signals in kidneys implying these ultra-small nanodots could be excreted out of the body <i>via</i> renal clearance.</p><p><b>Conclusion</b>: We demonstrated the excellent properties of Pa-PEG nanodots that can be an <i>in vivo</i> imaging-guided PDT agent with renal clearable behavior for potential future clinical translation.</p> ","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 01 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":18940,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"2ccfb2f9cea8fef56f8b3c0b973123f0","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Kittipan Siwawannapong, Rui Zhang, Huali Lei, Qiutong Jin, Wantao Tang, Ziliang Dong, Rung-Yi Lai, Zhuang Liu, Anyanee Kamkaew, Liang Cheng","publishedOrCreatedDate":1602257463578}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-10-09 23:31:03","updatedTime":"2020-10-09 23:31:03","feedId":18940,"fetchDate":"Fri, 09 Oct 2020 15:31:03 +0000","fetchMs":1277,"handleMs":711,"totalMs":67000,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":760,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"72e021969f56c10206ce79830911afb1","hostName":"us-036*","requestId":"b48aeb0cf4834f41a77cefce963095c8_18940","contentType":"text/xml","totalBytes":0,"bgimgsTotal":0,"bgimgsGithubTotal":0,"articlesImgsTotal":0,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":0,"successGithubMap":{},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-09-07 02:18:42","updatedTime":"2020-09-07 02:52:52","id":18940,"name":"Theranostics","url":"http://www.thno.org/rss/current.xml","subscriber":175,"website":null,"icon":"http://www.thno.org/favicon.ico","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx63/cdn84@2020_2/2020/09/06/18-52-51-820_cf11fedea3ebaf17.ico","description":"Theranostics RSS feed -- Volume 10","weekly":null,"link":null},"noPictureArticleList":[],"tmpCommonImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBodyImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBgImgCdnBytes":0,"extra4":{"start":1602257396603,"total":0,"statList":[{"spend":66281,"msg":"获取xml内容"},{"spend":711,"msg":"解释文章"},{"spend":0,"msg":"上传封面图到cdn"},{"spend":0,"msg":"修正封面图上传失败重新上传"},{"spend":0,"msg":"正文链接上传到cdn"}]},"extra5":0,"extra6":0,"extra7ImgCdnFailResultVector":[],"extra10_invalidATagHrefValue":{},"extra111_proxyServerAndStatMap":{},"extra12ImgCdnSuccessResultVector":[],"successGithubMap":{},"failGithubMap":{}}
