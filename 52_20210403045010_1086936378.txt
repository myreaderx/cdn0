It&#8217;s a great way to add a sense of vastness, <a aria-label=\"depth (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/depth-dimension-photos/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">depth</a>, and/or motion to a photograph. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 data-section id=\"why-is-the-rule-of-space-important\">Why is the rule of space important?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To understand the rule of space, we first need to take a brief look at positive and negative space. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Photographers use the terms <em>positive space</em> and <a aria-label=\"negative space (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/negative-space-in-photography/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\"><em>negative</em> <em>space</em></a> to contrast impactful and more subtle areas in a photograph. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Generally, positive space refers to specific subjects that command a viewer&#8217;s attention. Negative space, on the other hand, is less visually demanding and provides a frame for the main event in an image. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, in the image below, the clouds represent positive space, whereas the sky and dark shadows create the negative space that frames the main subject:  </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image caption-align-left is-style-with-caption\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><span class=\"responsive-image wp-image-202477\" style=\"width:1500px\"><span class=\"space\" style=\"width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%\"></span><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/rule_of_space_in_photography_clouds_kennedy.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"rule of space in photography clouds\" class=\"wp-image-202477\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/rule_of_space_in_photography_clouds_kennedy.jpg?w=1500&#38;ssl=1 1500w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/rule_of_space_in_photography_clouds_kennedy.jpg?resize=300%2C200&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/rule_of_space_in_photography_clouds_kennedy.jpg?resize=600%2C400&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/rule_of_space_in_photography_clouds_kennedy.jpg?resize=768%2C512&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/rule_of_space_in_photography_clouds_kennedy.jpg?resize=90%2C60&#38;ssl=1 90w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/rule_of_space_in_photography_clouds_kennedy.jpg?resize=717%2C478&#38;ssl=1 717w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></span><figcaption><a href=\"https://geni.us/CanonEOS5DMarkIV\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"Canon 5D Mark IV (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" class=\"ek-link\">Canon 5D Mark IV</a> | <a href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/writers-favorite-lens-the-canon-24-105mm-f4/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"Canon EF 24-105mm f/4L IS USM (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">Canon EF 24-105mm f/4L IS USM</a> | f/10 | 1/500s | ISO 100</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>So where does the rule of space in photography fit in? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In general terms, the rule of space governs the use of negative space within an image. By understanding the nature of the rule of space, a photographer can harness the intent of a subject, as well as add depth and perspective to the image. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rule of space is important because it aids a photographer in articulating the energy of a photograph &#8211; and it guides the viewer&#8217;s eye by sculpting key visual events and affording the subject more room to move.   </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 data-section id=\"working-with-the-rule-of-space-the-basics\">Working with the rule of space: the basics</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To work with the rule of space in photography, first consider the behavior of your subject. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ask yourself: What is the subject doing? Is it moving or stationary? How does it occupy space? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, visualize what you want to convey in the photograph. Is it movement? Perspective? Depth? Narrative? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The nature and behavior of your subject plus your intent should together determine how you apply the rule of space.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 data-section id=\"perspective\">Perspective </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the main ways the rule of space can impact a photograph is through <a href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/perspective-photography-dont-just-stand-move-feet/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">perspective</a>.

The extra space conveys the subject&#8217;s movement, adding the momentum a tight crop may lack.  </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image caption-align-left is-style-with-caption\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><span class=\"responsive-image wp-image-202777\" style=\"width:1500px\"><span class=\"space\" style=\"width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%\"></span><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/rule_of_space_in_photography_jet_star_flight_kennedy.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"airplane flying\" class=\"wp-image-202777\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/rule_of_space_in_photography_jet_star_flight_kennedy.jpg?w=1500&#38;ssl=1 1500w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/rule_of_space_in_photography_jet_star_flight_kennedy.jpg?resize=300%2C200&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/rule_of_space_in_photography_jet_star_flight_kennedy.jpg?resize=600%2C400&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/rule_of_space_in_photography_jet_star_flight_kennedy.jpg?resize=768%2C512&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/rule_of_space_in_photography_jet_star_flight_kennedy.jpg?resize=90%2C60&#38;ssl=1 90w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/rule_of_space_in_photography_jet_star_flight_kennedy.jpg?resize=717%2C478&#38;ssl=1 717w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></span><figcaption>Allowing a subject room to move adds momentum. <br />Canon 5D Mark II | Canon EF 24-105mm f/4L IS USM | f/10 | 1/640s | ISO 250</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h3 data-section id=\"adding-depth\">Adding depth </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The rule of space in photography is not limited to highly active subjects; it works for stationary subject matter, too!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, in portraiture, your composition can be governed by pairing the gaze or gesticulations of the subject with negative space. A subject&#8217;s gaze naturally directs our attention &#8211; we want to see what the subject sees. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But when a gaze is met by negative space, the viewer&#8217;s eye will often naturally return to the original source of the gaze. The rule of space provides an organic way of adding depth and directing viewer attention. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also use the rule of space with non-human/animal subject matter &#8211; based on their movement, perceived gesticulations, and extensions. By following the momentum, composition, or behavior of a non-human subject, you&#8217;ll find ideal placements for negative space. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the example below, I surrounded several blossoms with negative space; this additional room suggests growth and depth.

Often, negative space serves as a frame to emphasize the key subjects in an image. </p> </div> <div class=\"schema-faq-section\" id=\"faq-question-1611013647506\"><strong class=\"schema-faq-question\">How do photographers use the rule of space in composition?</strong> <p class=\"schema-faq-answer\">The rule encourages photographers to make use of negative space. There are many ways to do this. You can focus on coupling subjects with negative space by selecting minimalist backdrops, or you can pair the gaze of a portrait subject with additional negative space. </p> </div> <div class=\"schema-faq-section\" id=\"faq-question-1611013998042\"><strong class=\"schema-faq-question\">Who are some photographers that use the rule of space?</strong> <p class=\"schema-faq-answer\">There are countless photographers who make use of the rule of space.

That&#8217;s why compositional rules can be broken. The rule of space in photography is simply a guide &#8211; so if an image looks better without extra space, then go with your instincts. And if you aren&#8217;t sure, try taking a series of photos with different spatial approaches and analyze the results.</p> </div> </div>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/rule-of-space-in-photography/\">The Rule of Space in Photography: A Comprehensive Guide (+ Examples)</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com\">Digital Photography School</a>.

If you&#8217;re an APS-C shooter who demands the highest optical quality, or you&#8217;re working full frame and want some compact-yet-capable prime lenses, the 24mm f/2.8, 40mm f/2.5, and 50mm f/2.5 will deliver.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, all three lenses offer fast maximum apertures, which translates to lovely <a aria-label=\"bokeh (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-achieve-nice-bokeh-in-plain-english/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">bokeh</a> &#8211; especially on the 50mm f/2.5, but also on the 40mm f/2.5 and even the 24mm f/2.8 when shooting close-ups.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, f/2.5 and f/2.8 maximum apertures will get you more than just creamy backgrounds. With a <a href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"wide aperture (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">wide aperture</a>, you can shoot indoors or at twilight while still maintaining a reasonable <a aria-label=\"ISO (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/iso-settings/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">ISO</a>, so you can photograph <a href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/tips-event-photography/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"events (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">events</a> and <a href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/create-shoot-night-portraits/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"night portraits (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">night portraits</a> &#8211; or record low-light video &#8211; and come away with clean results.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sony also promises &#8220;fast, precise AF with excellent tracking performance&#8221; and top-notch build quality (all three lenses are dust and moisture resistant).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But while strong build quality, image quality, and focusing do make for a powerful package, even more impressive are the lenses&#8217; compact builds. <a aria-label=\"Travel photographers (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/10-travel-photography-tips/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">Travel photographers</a>, street photographers, and videographers will love the pocket-sized design, perfect for on-the-go shooting, long hours behind the camera, and international travel. In fact, all three lenses are <em>identical </em>in size, so you can pack them all without sacrificing weight or space.

You can grab each lens for just $600 USD &#8211; not bad at all, given the optics, build quality, and AF capabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you&#8217;re a Sony shooter in need of a new lens (or two, or three) for travel photography, portrait photography, street photography, or handheld videography, I highly recommend you take a closer look at these options.

Well, flash is available, so is a desk lamp or a torch &#8211; this is the week to try them out!</p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>This week&#8217;s photo challenge is &#8216;Artificial Light&#8217; you can use any light source that isn&#8217;t the sun (or you can combine the sun with artificial) for your photo. Use the hashtag #dPSLight </strong></p>\n</p>\n<p>Light comes in MANY shapes and sizes, my first try with adding light to a photo came from a funny little desk lamp (We called it ghetto lighting) I used to stand around trying to get the ceiling light (one of those big paper ball things) in the right spot to give me the light I wanted, the addiction starting mostly on the 29th of September, 2008&#8230;</p>\n</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img class=\"wp-image-206370\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2900314972_83041980eb_k.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"Simon Pollock Ghetto Lighting\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n</div>\n</p>\n<p>These days <strong>lighting</strong> comes in many (as many as it always has, plus a couple more?) forms, I&#8217;ll share the ones I use &#8211; I have a single flash, it&#8217;s a Jinbei HD-2 Pro and a very capable little unit! If I need more power, and what I use on any commercial shoot, as well as the HD-2 Pro, are my two Westcott FJ-400 studio lights, they&#8217;re very nice, powerful enough for pretty much anything I need them for. Other <strong>lights</strong> I love and use often are the two little Aputure AL-MW lights (they&#8217;re waterproof) and I have two Spiffy RGB LED lights, too&#8230; A collection of many years I guess you&#8217;d say!</p>\n</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img class=\"wp-image-206375\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/light.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"Weekly Photo Challenge – Artificial Light\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n</div>\n</p>\n<p>BUT you don&#8217;t need to have &#8220;proper lighting gear&#8221; you need to have a desire to learn and a desk lamp!

Portrait photography is a broad genre that encompasses nearly every subgenre that involves photographing people. It doesn&#8217;t matter if we&#8217;re talking <a aria-label=\"studio portraits (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/5-tips-setup-home-studio-dramatic-portraits/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">studio portraits</a>, <a aria-label=\"street candids (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/getting-close-and-personal-11-tips-for-close-up-candid-street-photography/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">street candids</a>, or <a aria-label=\"fashion photography (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/10-fashion-photography-tips/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">fashion photography</a>. If it has a person in the frame, it&#8217;s probably a portrait.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Headshots</strong>: Headshots are a subgenre of portrait photography. The difference is that headshots serve a very specific purpose. Whether it&#8217;s actors&#8217; headshots or corporate headshots, the purpose is to sell something. That something could be an actor&#8217;s ability to fit a role&#8217;s physical requirements, or it could be your business professionalism.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Headshots are limited to close-up images of the subject&#8217;s head. They can also include head and shoulders as well as half-length shots. Before capturing a headshot, it&#8217;s important you understand where and how the photo will be used so you can get the right shot for the right purpose.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 data-section id=\"tips-for-black-and-white-headshots\">Tips for black and white headshots</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image caption-align-left is-style-with-caption\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><span class=\"responsive-image wp-image-202905\" style=\"width:1500px\"><span class=\"space\" style=\"width:1500px; padding-top:73.27%\"></span><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1099\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/black-and-white-headshots-headshot-56835683.jpg?resize=1500%2C1099&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"black and white headshot of a man\" class=\"wp-image-202905\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/black-and-white-headshots-headshot-56835683.jpg?w=1500&#38;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/black-and-white-headshots-headshot-56835683.jpg?resize=300%2C220&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/black-and-white-headshots-headshot-56835683.jpg?resize=600%2C440&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/black-and-white-headshots-headshot-56835683.jpg?resize=768%2C563&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/black-and-white-headshots-headshot-56835683.jpg?resize=717%2C525&#38;ssl=1 717w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></span><figcaption><a href=\"https://geni.us/Canon5DMarkIIIdPS\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"Canon 5D Mark III (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" class=\"ek-link\">Canon 5D Mark III</a> | <a href=\"https://geni.us/Canon50mmmacro\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"Canon EF 50mm f/2.5 Macro (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" class=\"ek-link\">Canon EF 50mm f/2.5 Macro</a> | 50mm | 1/80s&#160;| f/5.6 | ISO 100</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>There are no hard and fast rules for creating headshots.

This may not be a problem in a normal portrait session, but with headshots, you need to make sure you&#8217;re focused on the specific end result. If you change tack and the results aren&#8217;t showing your subject in the desired manner, you&#8217;ll have wasted time and effort on images that are unsuitable for the subject&#8217;s uses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One way to help keep you on track is to ask your subject to share the purpose of their headshot. Allow them to be as specific and detailed as possible. Once you have an answer to that question, you should find it much easier to stay on track.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are photographing an actor with representation, ask them for their agency&#8217;s headshot guidelines (or ask the agency yourself). This will give you a strict set of limitations and help to ensure you get the required result.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 data-section id=\"getting-it-right-in-camera-is-just-as-important-as-ever\">2.

Light your images well with good exposure and good contrast. Learn your lighting patterns and use a meter if you have to. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Get this step right, and you might find that you have little more editing to do beyond the actual black and white conversion.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 data-section id=\"start-in-color\">3. Start in color</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It might be tempting to set your camera to a black and white mode at the point of shooting.

If you have four times as much light falling on the highlight side of your portrait, then the lighting ratio would be 4:1.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But how exactly do you measure light? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While you can do it with the <a aria-label=\"built-in meter in your camera (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/metering-modes-and-how-your-camera-meter-works/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">built-in meter in your camera</a>, it is much easier and more accurate to use a <a aria-label=\"handheld incident light meter (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/tips-for-using-a-handheld-light-meter/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">handheld incident light meter</a>. You see, your in-camera meter takes a measurement of the light reflecting off your subject &#8211; whereas a handheld meter can measure the amount of light falling <em>on </em>your subject and therefore gives you a more accurate value.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 data-section id=\"lighting-ratios-key-concepts\">Lighting ratios: key concepts</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To properly measure and understand lighting ratios, you need to know a few things. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, light is measured by <a href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"f-stops (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">f-stops</a>. The aperture dial on your camera generally goes up in 1/3-stop increments, though the full stops for aperture are f/1, f/1.4, f/2, f/2.8, f/4, f/5.6, f/8, f/11, f/16, f/22, f/32, etc. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>(A simple way to remember all the numbers is to memorize f/1 and f/1.4; all the other pairs are doubled from these with a few rounded off.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You also need to understand that <a href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/shutter-speed/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"shutter speeds (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">shutter speeds</a> are also representative of f-stops, with the full stops at 1s, ½s, ¼s, 1/8s, 1/15s, 1/30s, 1/60s, 1/125s, 1/250s, 1/500s, 1/1000s, etc. Shutter speed full stops are easier to remember as they are generally doubled (with a couple instances of rounding, such as 1/8s to 1/15s).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, know that each full stop is <em>double </em>(or <em>half</em>, depending on whether you go down or up) the amount of light compared to the previous one. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if you are shooting at f/4 and want to shoot at f/5.6, you will need to double the amount of light to get an equivalent exposure (you&#8217;ll need one more full stop of light). If you want to narrow your aperture by 2 stops, you&#8217;ll need to add 2&#215;2 &#8211; or 4 &#8211; times more light. Likewise, 3 stops correspond to 8 times more light (2x2x2) and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Knowing this, you can figure out how to create and measure ratios. In the next series of photos, I will demonstrate four different lighting ratios and how they were achieved.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 data-section id=\"ratio\">1:1 ratio</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/1-1ratio-darlenehildebrandt.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"1:1 lighting ratio\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>A 1:1 ratio is even lighting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In other words, there is no difference in the meter readings on both sides of the face. As you can see in the photo above, 1:1 lighting is very flat, and it can be achieved in a couple of different ways. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, you can use <a aria-label=\"fill flash (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/using-fill-flash/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">fill flash</a> and make the flash equal to the main light source. This is harder to achieve until you’ve had some practice, and you’ll often end up overpowering the light with flash. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Secondly, you could use a <a href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/10-ways-use-5-1-reflector/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"reflector (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">reflector</a>. It will need to be <em>very </em>close to the subject, and the goal is to eliminate all shadows on the subject&#8217;s face.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a 1:1 ratio, and it&#8217;s pretty easy to see and recognize visually.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 data-section id=\"ratio\">2:1 ratio</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/1-2ratio-darlenehildebrandt.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"2:1 lighting ratio portrait photography\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>As the numbers suggest, a 2:1 ratio occurs when one side has twice as much light compared to the other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So knowing that plus what you know about f-stops, we can set up this lighting ratio.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, put your subject into the light where you are going to photograph them. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using a light meter, measure the light falling on the side of their face closest to the light source (i.e., the highlight side). Let’s say that measures f/8. (Keep your shutter speed the same for all measurements to maintain consistency.) </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then bring in your reflector and use the light meter again, but this time measure the light falling on the side of the subject&#8217;s face that is <em>farther away</em> from the light source (from here on in, this will be referred to as the <em>shadow side</em>).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note: If you are using a handheld meter, make sure to shield it from excess light that comes from the other side of your subject. So if you are metering the shadow side nearer the reflector, shield the meter so the main light source isn&#8217;t hitting it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, you <em>know </em>that your highlight side has a reading of f/8. To achieve a 2:1 lighting ratio, you&#8217;ll need to get your meter to read f/5.6 (which is one stop less light) on the shadow side. So adjust the reflector distance until the meter settles on f/5.6.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, it may help to study the image above and recognize the contrast range from the highlight to the shadow side of the face. It&#8217;s subtle, but you should be able to see it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 data-section id=\"ratio\">4:1 ratio</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/4-1ratio-darlenehildebrandt.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"4:1 lighting ratio portrait photography\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>A 4:1 ratio is double a 2:1 ratio. So if 2:1 featured twice as much light &#8211; or one stop &#8211; how much light will a 4:1 ratio require? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The answer is <em>four </em>times as much light (2&#215;2), which is a 2-stop difference from the highlight side to the shadow side of the face.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I teach an available light class, and I always recommend working with natural light before you advance on to <a aria-label=\"speedlights (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/take-your-light-with-you-the-power-of-speedlights/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">speedlights</a>. With available or natural light and a reflector, it is <em>much</em> easier to learn and practice lighting because you can <em>see </em>what happens as you make changes (WYSIWYG). Flash is harder to predict as you can’t see it without actually taking a photograph.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if our main light (the window) is still at f/8, what should be the value of our fill light/reflector (or the shadow side) to achieve a 4:1 ratio? Let’s do the steps again: f/8>f/5.6>f/4. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, two stops less than f/8 is f/4 (and this is the desired measurement to create a 4:1 ratio). Look at the photo above and compare it to the 2:1 image; do you see how the shadow side is getting darker?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 data-section id=\"ratio\">8:1 ratio</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/8-1ratio-darlenehildebrandt.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"8:1 lighting ratio\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The last ratio we’ll look at is 8:1. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 8:1 ratio requires 8 times as much light, or 3 stops, on the highlight side of the face compared to the shadow side.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you can see in the image above, 8:1 lighting is quite dramatic, and anything greater than 8:1 will not hold much detail on the shadow side of the face at all. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, prints have a maximum contrast range of 4-6 stops, so unless you want one side of the face overexposed or the shadows pure black, I suggest keeping your lighting ratios at 8:1 or smaller.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that an 8:1 ratio can be a bit tough to create. You may need harsher lighting and possibly a black reflector to add blacks into the shadow side (rather than reflecting light onto it). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We calculate it the same way as above: if 4:1 is 4 times the light, then 8:1 will be 8 times the light, or 3 stops. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if we are still at f/8 on our highlight side, we need to get our shadow side to read: f/8>f/5.6>f/4>f/2.8. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 data-section id=\"how-to-use-lighting-ratios\">How to use lighting ratios</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that we have this knowledge of ratios, let&#8217;s put it to use! Remember: The ratio can add to the success of your portrait, or it can ruin it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you look at the example images again, pay attention to how the mood of the image changes with the ratio. Notice how the higher ratios create more drama and power. Notice how the lower ratios are softer and more innocent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Generally somewhere between 2:1 and 4:1 is the commonly used ratio for most portraiture. It’s enough to create three-dimensionality on the face, but not too much to create unattractive, deep shadows. I personally like a 3:1 ratio (1.5 stops) or a 4:1 ratio, myself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a child or baby, you often want a lower ratio because the softer result goes well with the subject matter. But a grizzled old cowboy with weathered, wrinkled skin and unkempt whiskers looks much better with 4:1 or 8:1 lighting. Why? He&#8217;s rougher, tougher, and can handle the increased contrast, plus it&#8217;s suitable for his look.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re worried about not owning a handheld meter, you don&#8217;t necessarily need to go out and buy one. I&#8217;d only suggest you do that if you plan on getting into studio lighting. Otherwise, just practice seeing the difference between the various ratios (which is why I suggest natural light), and if they aren&#8217;t a perfect 4:1 or 8:1 or whatever, then it doesn&#8217;t matter. Just learn to recognize when it&#8217;s too strong and when it&#8217;s too weak for the effect you want to create.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s another example of ratios at work. None of it is right or wrong, but which do you think is the most appropriate ratio for my subject? Figure that part out, and you&#8217;ll be ahead of the game!</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image caption-align-left is-style-with-caption\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/strong-ratio.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"headshot without a reflector\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/><figcaption>My first shot had no reflector, and I found the shadows too dark and the overall portrait too contrasty.

Shooting in bright sunlight makes it almost impossible to control your ratios, plus the light won&#8217;t be desirable or flattering on the subject&#8217;s face. Use <a href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/are-you-practicing-these-5-natural-lighting-tips/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"natural light (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">natural light</a> from a window with indirect lighting (no direct sun coming in) if you can. And if the sun is streaming in, try adding sheer curtains or even stretching a white bed sheet across to diffuse the light.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, here are some lighting ratio starting points:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>For babies and small children, use a lower ratio like 1:1 or 2:1. Children move so quickly that keeping them in the light and facing in the right direction is exceedingly difficult, and even light helps mitigate this issue.</li><li>For women, use a medium ratio like 2:1 or 3:1.</li><li>For men and business portraits, use a slightly stronger ratio, such as 4:1 or 6:1.</li><li>For artists, bands, and other dramatic portraits, use a higher ratio.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, keep in mind that there are no steadfast rules on how to do ratios in portraiture. Like everything in photography, it&#8217;s about learning the techniques, then using them as suggestions while you experiment and find your own style or voice. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, can you put 8:1 lighting on a glamorous movie star or 1:1 lighting on a coal miner? Absolutely! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>(I&#8217;ll even give you some homework that&#8217;ll prove both ratios can be effective if they are done well.)</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 data-section id=\"homework-and-action-steps\">Homework and action steps</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Your homework assignment is to research the following photographers. Tell me how they broke the general rules I&#8217;ve mentioned above, yet still had great success and amazing images:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a aria-label=\"George Hurrell (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://georgehurrell.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" class=\"ek-link\">George Hurrell</a></li><li><a aria-label=\"Richard Avedon (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.avedonfoundation.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" class=\"ek-link\">Richard Avedon</a></li><li><a href=\"https://karsh.org/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"Yousuf Karsh (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" class=\"ek-link\">Yousuf Karsh</a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Those three photographers right there are some of the greatest portrait artists to ever live. Learn from them.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 data-section id=\"a-lighting-ratios-guide-conclusion\">A lighting ratios guide: conclusion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that you&#8217;ve finished this article, you know all about lighting ratios &#8211; and you know how to use them for stunning results. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what&#8217;s the next step?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Practice! If you simply dedicate a few minutes per day to working with portrait lighting, you&#8217;ll become a master in no time at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now over to you:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>What do you think of these lighting ratio concepts?

And how do these sensor differences affect your photos? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thinking about camera sensors can get pretty confusing. That&#8217;s why I break it all down for you in this article &#8211; and I offer plenty of examples to illustrate the camera sensor effects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you want to know, once and for all, how sensor type impacts your images, then let&#8217;s get started.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><span class=\"responsive-image wp-image-157587\" style=\"width:1500px\"><span class=\"space\" style=\"width:1500px; padding-top:47.4%\"></span><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"711\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/full_frame_vs_crop_sensor_vs_micro_four_thirds_4.jpg?resize=1500%2C711&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Full Frame VS Crop Sensor VS Micro Four Thirds: Camera Sensors Explained\" class=\"wp-image-157587\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/full_frame_vs_crop_sensor_vs_micro_four_thirds_4.jpg?w=1500&#38;ssl=1 1500w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/full_frame_vs_crop_sensor_vs_micro_four_thirds_4.jpg?resize=300%2C142&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/full_frame_vs_crop_sensor_vs_micro_four_thirds_4.jpg?resize=768%2C364&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/full_frame_vs_crop_sensor_vs_micro_four_thirds_4.jpg?resize=600%2C284&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/full_frame_vs_crop_sensor_vs_micro_four_thirds_4.jpg?resize=717%2C340&#38;ssl=1 717w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></span></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 data-section id=\"what-is-a-full-frame-vs-an-aps-c-crop-vs-a-micro-four-thirds-mft-camera\">What is a full-frame vs an APS-C (crop) vs a Micro Four Thirds (MFT) camera? </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The sensor is the part of a camera that actually captures an image. It takes in light, which it then converts to image data. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, different camera types offer different-sized sensors, and that&#8217;s the fundamental difference between full-frame, APS-C, and Micro Four Thirds cameras.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A <a aria-label=\"full-frame camera (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/understand-differences-full-frame-versus-crop-sensor-cameras/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">full-frame camera</a> contains a sensor size equivalent to 35mm film (36 mm x 24 mm). This is the largest sensor size marketed to photography consumers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An APS-C camera, on the other hand, has a smaller sensor. The specifics depend on the camera brand, but the sensor size is generally around 23 mm x 15 mm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, there are <a aria-label=\"Micro Four Thirds cameras (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/are-micro-four-thirds-cameras-dead-or-do-they-still-have-their-place/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">Micro Four Thirds cameras</a>, which contain Micro Four Thirds sensors; these are even smaller than APS-C sensors, clocking in at just 17.3 mm x 13 mm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, apart from the physical sizes, there are several important differences between full-frame, APS-C, and Micro Four Thirds sensors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So let’s take a look at the factors affected by sensor size, starting with:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 data-section id=\"crop-factor\">Crop factor</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Say you mount a 50mm lens on a full-frame camera. When you press the shutter button, it captures a 50mm image. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Makes sense, right? A 50mm lens captures a 50mm image. Simple.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what if you mount a 50mm lens on an APS-C camera? Will it capture a 50mm image? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The answer is <em>no</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since an APS-C sensor is <em>smaller </em>than the full-frame sensor, the sensor <em>crops </em>the frame, giving you a result that looks zoomed in &#8211; as if you took the photo with a 75mm lens rather than a 50mm lens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>(Confused? Don&#8217;t be. The effect is similar to taking a photo with a 50mm lens, then heading home and cropping the image on your computer. You&#8217;ll get a tighter shot, one that looks like it was taken with a longer lens.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that is what the term <em><a href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/crop-factor-explained/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">crop factor</a> </em>means. It refers to the different crop effects created by different sensor sizes. A full-frame camera is the standard; it has no crop factor. An APS-C sensor (also known as a crop sensor), has a crop factor of 1.5x (on Nikon and Sony cameras) or 1.6x (on Canon cameras). The Micro Four Thirds crop factor is even stronger: 2x.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I explained above, the crop factor affects your field of view. Look at the series of images below:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image caption-align-left wp-image-157577 size-full is-style-with-caption\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><span class=\"responsive-image wp-image-157577\" style=\"width:1500px\"><span class=\"space\" style=\"width:1500px; padding-top:23.27%\"></span><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"349\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/full_frame_vs_crop_sensor_vs_micro_four_thirds_1.jpg?resize=1500%2C349&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"full frame vs crop vs Micro Four Thirds sensors compared\" class=\"wp-image-157577\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/full_frame_vs_crop_sensor_vs_micro_four_thirds_1.jpg?w=1500&#38;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/full_frame_vs_crop_sensor_vs_micro_four_thirds_1.jpg?resize=300%2C70&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/full_frame_vs_crop_sensor_vs_micro_four_thirds_1.jpg?resize=768%2C179&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/full_frame_vs_crop_sensor_vs_micro_four_thirds_1.jpg?resize=600%2C140&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/full_frame_vs_crop_sensor_vs_micro_four_thirds_1.jpg?resize=717%2C167&#38;ssl=1 717w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></span><figcaption>Left: Photo taken with a full-frame camera. Center: Photo taken with a crop-sensor camera. Right: Photo taken with a Micro Four Thirds camera.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The image on the left was taken with a full-frame camera. But apply the APS-C crop factor, and you get a tighter shot (the center image). Use a Micro Four Thirds camera, and you&#8217;ll get an even tighter result (the right image).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 data-section id=\"focal-length\">Focal length</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A crop factor has a predictable affect on your lens&#8217;s focal length. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You see, the focal length measurement of any given lens is based on the standard 35mm film format. And since an APS-C camera (and a Micro Four Thirds camera) crop out the edges of the frame, you end up with an &#8220;effective&#8221; focal length that corresponds directly to the original focal length <em>multiplied </em>by the crop factor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, a crop-sensor camera such as the <a aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://geni.us/NikonD5600dPS\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">Nikon D5600</a> has a crop factor of 1.5x. Thus, if I mount a 35mm lens on my Nikon D5600, it would multiply the focal length by 1.5x, effectively giving me a focal length output of around 52.5mm. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>(But if you mount the same lens on a full-frame Nikon body such as the <a href=\"https://geni.us/dPSNikonD850Camera\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">D850</a>, it gives an output of 35mm.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, if you mount a 35mm lens on a Micro Four Thirds camera &#8211; which has a crop factor of 2x &#8211; it effectively <em>doubles </em>the focal length to around 70mm.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image wp-image-157582 size-full is-style-with-caption\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><span class=\"responsive-image wp-image-157582\" style=\"width:1500px\"><span class=\"space\" style=\"width:1500px; padding-top:23.27%\"></span><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"349\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/full_frame_vs_crop_sensor_vs_micro_four_thirds_2.jpg?resize=1500%2C349&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Three images taken with different sensors\" class=\"wp-image-157582\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/full_frame_vs_crop_sensor_vs_micro_four_thirds_2.jpg?w=1500&#38;ssl=1 1500w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/full_frame_vs_crop_sensor_vs_micro_four_thirds_2.jpg?resize=300%2C70&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/full_frame_vs_crop_sensor_vs_micro_four_thirds_2.jpg?resize=768%2C179&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/full_frame_vs_crop_sensor_vs_micro_four_thirds_2.jpg?resize=600%2C140&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/full_frame_vs_crop_sensor_vs_micro_four_thirds_2.jpg?resize=717%2C167&#38;ssl=1 717w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></span><figcaption>Left: Photo taken at 35mm on a full-frame camera.

Thus, a Micro Four Thirds camera gives us more depth of field when compared to a full-frame camera, assuming both cameras are using equivalent effective focal lengths. Same with an APS-C camera compared to a full-frame camera; you get more depth of field using the APS-C camera, assuming the effective focal length on both cameras is identical.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, an image shot at f/1.8 on a Micro Four Thirds camera gives an output similar to an image shot at f/3.6 on a full-frame camera and f/2.7 on a crop-sensor camera. This is assuming that the effective focal length and other shooting conditions stay the same.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 data-section id=\"camera-size\">Camera size</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Full-frame sensors are larger than APS-C and Micro Four Thirds sensors. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So as you can probably guess, full-frame cameras tend to be far bigger and heavier than their APS-C and MFT counterparts. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For some photographers, this won&#8217;t matter much; if you shoot in the studio every day, a smaller Micro Four Thirds camera won&#8217;t offer much of an advantage. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if you&#8217;re a travel photographer who needs to keep your gear as lightweight and compact as possible, a Micro Four Thirds body is a fantastic option. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, APS-C and MFT cameras are more convenient. You can hang them on your neck or keep them in a backpack all day without feeling like you&#8217;re carrying a brick.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 data-section id=\"low-light-performance\">Low-light performance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Generally, full-frame cameras feature superior low-light and <a aria-label=\"high-ISO performance (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/iso-settings/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">high-ISO performance</a>. This results in much better image quality than crop-sensor (or Micro Four Thirds) cameras can achieve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But why do full-frame cameras perform better in low light?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Full-frame cameras&#160;have larger sensors and are therefore capable of capturing more light than their smaller-sensor counterparts, which minimizes <a href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-avoid-and-reduce-noise-in-your-images/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"unwanted noise (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">unwanted noise</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, Micro Four Thirds cameras don&#8217;t perform well under low-light conditions where the ISO needs to be cranked up to, say, above 1600.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>(Note that full-frame cameras <em>also </em>offer superior <a href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/understanding-dynamic-range-photography/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"dynamic range (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">dynamic range</a>, which allows you to capture more detail in a single shot.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For these reasons, while full-frame cameras can be expensive, bulky, and annoying to carry around, they are still the industry standard and the preferred cameras for nearly all professional photography work.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 data-section id=\"full-frame-vs-aps-c-vs-micro-four-thirds-conclusion\">Full frame vs APS-C vs Micro Four Thirds: conclusion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that you&#8217;ve finished this article, you should hopefully have a grasp on the differences between these sensor types &#8211; and why you might want to choose one sensor over another. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just remember: </p>\n\n\n\n<p>All three sensors &#8211; full frame, APS-C, and MFT &#8211; are <em>very </em>capable of capturing stunning photos. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So don&#8217;t worry <em>too </em>much about the differences.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now over to you:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Do you have a favorite sensor type?

First, there’s the 61-megapixel sensor, which serves up plenty of resolution for landscape shooters as well as commercial photographers in need of detailed files. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then there’s a 3.68M-dot external <a aria-label=\"electronic viewfinder (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/optical-versus-electronic-viewfinders-best/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">electronic viewfinder</a>, which attaches to the side of the fp L and allows photographers to work with the camera the way they’d work with high-resolution competitors such as the <a aria-label=\"Sony a7R IV (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/review-sony-a7r-iv-mirrorless-camera/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">Sony a7R IV</a>.

Of course, zoom in too far and you sacrifice significant megapixels, but given the impressive starting resolution, it may come in handy if you need a bit of extra reach.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fp L also promises improved autofocus over the fp, thanks to a hybrid autofocus system that combines contrast-detection and phase-detection AF for “smooth autofocus that is high precision, fast, and excellent at tracking a moving subject.” While the fp’s contrast-detection system was certainly serviceable, street photographers, portrait photographers, and travel photographers will appreciate the boost in speed and tracking, as will plenty of videographers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interestingly, Sigma also highlights another new feature of the fp L: “USB-C charging <em>while the camera is on</em>.” In other words, you can pop in the battery, start shooting, and then &#8211; if the battery gets low &#8211; you can plug the camera into a mobile power bank for what Sigma is calling “unlimited power supply.” If you’re a photographer who spends days in the field but doesn’t want to juggle stacks of batteries, this will be a huge help, and videographers will love the ability to film for hours without worry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of videography:&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the fp L may not be as video-centric as the fp, it’s perfectly capable of pro-level recording; you can shoot 4K/30p footage, and you get plenty of other video features, such as a mic port, zebra patterning, and RAW recording.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regarding lenses: the fp L is compatible with L-mount glass from Sigma, Leica, and Panasonic, including a host of powerful Sigma L-mount lenses. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So for those looking for a tiny camera that punches far above its weight, the Sigma fp L is a great option. You’ll be able to purchase the fp L for $2499 USD (or $2999 USD when bundled with the external EVF) as early as next month.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now over to you:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>What do you think of the Sigma fp L?

Then move your camera back and frame your shot how you want it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, press the shutter button the rest of the way. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With most digital cameras, this will result in a silhouetted subject; by forcing your camera to expose for the brightest part of the scene, you cause it to render the main subject as a dark silhouette. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that some cameras also have a <a aria-label=\"spot metering mode (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/fine-tune-your-exposures-with-spot-metering/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">spot metering mode</a> that helps with the above technique.
