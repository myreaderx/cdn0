The authors discuss exciting new studies showing how γδ T cells can regulate diverse physiological responses in tissues, ranging from thermogenesis in adipose tissue to remodelling at neuronal synapses.<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nri/rss/current/~4/1w0sfx3Grcw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 14 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":30258,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"75feb064837ac37b26b6316ce0313aee","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Julie C.

Nature Reviews Immunology provides in-depth coverage of this field, from fundamental mechanisms to translational aspects of basic research, and reviews the field’s most important developments. All Review and Perspective articles are carefully commissioned by the editors and written by leaders in the field. Articles are subject to rigorous peer review and provide high-quality and authoritative coverage of the field in each issue. Articles are carefully tailored by the editors to provide accessible information for non-specialists, and this is additionally enhanced with the use of Glossary terms and highlighted references. Each issue also contains Research Highlight articles – short pieces written by the editors that summarize the results from recent hot research papers.","weekly":null,"link":"http://feeds.nature.com"},"noPictureArticleList":[],"tmpCommonImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBodyImgCdnBytes":72,"tmpBgImgCdnBytes":0,"extra4":{"start":1603044093060,"total":0,"statList":[{"spend":1640,"msg":"获取xml内容"},{"spend":33600,"msg":"解释文章"},{"spend":0,"msg":"上传封面图到cdn"},{"spend":0,"msg":"修正封面图上传失败重新上传"},{"spend":1234,"msg":"正文链接上传到cdn"}]},"extra5":1,"extra6":1,"extra7ImgCdnFailResultVector":[],"extra10_invalidATagHrefValue":{},"extra111_proxyServerAndStatMap":{"http://us-031.herokuapp.com/":{"failCount":0,"successCount":1,"resultList":[200]}},"extra12ImgCdnSuccessResultVector":[{"code":1,"isDone":false,"source":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nri/rss/current/~4/1w0sfx3Grcw","sourceStatusCode":200,"destWidth":1,"destHeight":1,"fixedGithubDest":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn28@2020_2/2020/10/18/18-02-08-650_8db00eee0e42a574.webp","sourceBytes":43,"destBytes":72,"targetWebpQuality":75,"feedId":30258,"totalSpendMs":904,"convertSpendMs":5,"createdTime":"2020-10-19 02:02:08","host":"us-031*","referer":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41577-020-00452-4","linkMd5ListStr":"75feb064837ac37b26b6316ce0313aee","githubUser":"myreaderx19","githubHttpCode":201,"extra22GetBytesInfo":"1、没有Referer字段","extra23historyStatusCode":[200],"sourceSize":"43 B","destSize":"72 B","compressRate":"167.4%"}],"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx19":1},"failGithubMap":{}}
