With face-to-face training not possible in the current environment, institutions are using online learning to prepare for a digital future. The shift is at the heart of growing demand for <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/courses?query=guided%20projects\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\">Guided Projects</a>, which offer hands-on learning experiences for job-relevant skills across data science, technology, and business.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Guided Projects have attracted over one million enrollments since <a href=\"https://blog.coursera.org/announcing-guided-projects/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\">launching</a> in April this year, making it the fastest-growing product offering on Coursera. We now have more than 380 Guided Projects on the platform, with plans to offer over 1,000 by the end of the year.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most people learn in an institutional environment, either on campus or at work. For this reason, many institutions are interested in developing customized content for their learners. Starting today, we are expanding our enterprise offering to include private authoring of Guided Projects, courses, and assessments. Using powerful authoring tools, organizations can now translate their knowledge into content tailored to their institutional needs.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Privately authored Guided Projects enable organizations to become educators, elevating subject matter experts to support institutional knowledge sharing. Organizations such as Hertz and others are using authoring tools to develop Guided Projects in areas like IT, SaaS management, application troubleshooting, data visualization, and software onboarding.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/6j1CYXXnczqMfc8L5mE60Cd6TvPPRNIF1tCI9NMFgwpsH3EELctx1lBGHGnpsWGsOR33FMBdmrDS6H4W5R1Wl_ySyCFVZi3H9q_YnYIamgoo6bmdNjSpt8R63olqAlcHp0zUuSla\" alt=\"\"/><figcaption><em>Organizations can create their own Guided Projects using Coursera’s authoring tools</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Guided Projects advance the online learning experience by enabling immediate application of skills. According to the <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2019/10/where-companies-go-wrong-with-learning-and-development\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\">&#8220;Forgetting Curve” study</a>, we forget about 75% of new information after just six days if we don’t apply it. Guided Projects address this challenge by using step-by-step guidance and a virtual cloud workspace to apply skills to real-world environments.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Individuals and institutions around the world are benefiting from hands-on learning experiences.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"562\" src=\"https://blog.coursera.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-13-at-10.37.58-AM-1024x562.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-57277\" srcset=\"https://blog.coursera.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-13-at-10.37.58-AM-1024x562.png 1024w, https://blog.coursera.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-13-at-10.37.58-AM-600x329.png 600w, https://blog.coursera.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-13-at-10.37.58-AM-768x422.png 768w, https://blog.coursera.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-13-at-10.37.58-AM-1536x843.png 1536w, https://blog.coursera.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-13-at-10.37.58-AM.png 2044w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption> <em>Guided project enrollments around the world, August 2020</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>By accessing Guided Projects through the Coursera for Campus offering, students are learning to apply job-relevant skills in work environments.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>“As a master’s degree student, Guided Projects have been incredibly valuable in helping me gain practical technology and business skills that I can apply to my studies.
