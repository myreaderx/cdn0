Disney describes it as a &#8220;modern take on the hilarious &#8217;80s comedy,&#8221; and adds that it will star <strong>Zac Efron</strong>. Disney doesn&#8217;t specify who he&#8217;s playing, so I&#8217;m just going to go ahead and assume he&#8217;s playing the baby. In the &#8217;87 film, three bachelor roommates accidentally get stuck with a baby, and hilarity ensues. Also, there&#8217;s a subplot about drug smuggling for some reason. Anyway, the new <em>Three Men and a Baby</em> is headed to Disney+ in<strong> 2022</strong>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/FotoJet-28-1.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-649852\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/FotoJet-28-1-700x394.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"394\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/FotoJet-28-1-700x394.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/FotoJet-28-1-360x203.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/FotoJet-28-1-768x432.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<h2><strong>Real-Life Sports Stories </strong></h2>\n<p>This isn&#8217;t one project, it&#8217;s three.

Well, they&#8217;re moving to Disney+&#8230;in animated form. Rather than keep the live-action series going, Disney is instead making an all-new animated <em>Wimpy Kid</em> film for 2021 on, you guessed it, Disney+. The films are based on the book series that take the form of &#8220;journals of the main character, Greg Heffley. Befitting a teen&#8217;s diary, the books are filled with simple drawings of Greg&#8217;s daily adventures.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/ice-age-adventures.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-649860\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/ice-age-adventures-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/ice-age-adventures-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/ice-age-adventures-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/ice-age-adventures-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/ice-age-adventures.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<h2><strong><span class=\"css-901oao css-16my406 r-1qd0xha r-ad9z0x r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0\">The Ice Age Adventures of Buck Wild</span></strong></h2>\n<p>Quick, without looking it up – how many <em><strong>Ice Ag</strong>e</em> movies are there? If you guessed 10,000, you are correct. And here is another one – <strong><em>The Ice Age Adventures of Buck Wild</em></strong>. The film features &#8220;<span class=\"css-901oao css-16my406 r-1qd0xha r-ad9z0x r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0\">prankster possum brothers Crash and Eddie, and swashbuckling weasel Buck.&#8221; Buck is voiced by <strong>Simon Pegg</strong>. But I&#8217;m sure you already knew that, reader, because <em>Ice Age</em> is an important series that we all know and love and cherish. Look for this thing in 2022 on Disney+. At this point, I&#8217;m pretty sure the <em>Ice Age</em> franchise has lasted longer than the actual Ice Age (please don&#8217;t look this up to correct me). </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/night-at-the-museum-animated.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-649862\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/night-at-the-museum-animated-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/night-at-the-museum-animated-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/night-at-the-museum-animated-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/night-at-the-museum-animated-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/night-at-the-museum-animated.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<h2><strong>Night at the Museum </strong></h2>\n<p>Another live-action series getting an animated reboot: <strong><em>Night at the Museum</em></strong>. <strong>Shawn Levy</strong>, who helmed the live-action series, is producing.

This isn&#8217;t news, we knew this already, but Disney still felt the need to remind us. Or perhaps they wanted to drive home the fact that the film is sticking with its theatrical plan and not headed to Disney+.

Initially, it was rumored to be a sequel, but since then we&#8217;ve learned it&#8217;s a prequel. And other reports indicate the prequel follows Mufasa in his early days. Beyond that, well, we don&#8217;t know much. But <strong>Hans Zimmer</strong>, <strong>Pharrell Williams,</strong> and Jenkins&#8217; go-to composer <strong>Nicholas Britell</strong> are all working on the music.

And we already knew who was starring in it. But Disney went ahead and made it official: <strong>Halle Bailey</strong> is Ariel, <strong>Daveed Diggs</strong> is Sebastian, <strong>Javier Bardem</strong> is King Triton, <strong>Jacob Tremblay</strong> is Flounder, <strong>Melissa McCarthy</strong> is Ursula, <strong>Jonah Hauer-King</strong> is Prince Eric, and <strong>Awkwafina</strong> is Scuttle. There you have it. <strong>Rob Marshall</strong> is directing, and the film will feature music from the original movie, and new music by <strong>Alen Menken</strong> and <strong>Lin-Manuel Mirand</strong>a.

But now Disney+ says she is, and that the film is being produced by Tyler Perry, and that it&#8217;s headed to Disney+. In the original, Goldberg played a lounge singer who witnesses a murder and goes into hiding in a convent. And then she teaches all the nuns to sing and have fun.

So who is Wilson playing? His character was not confirmed at the Disney Investors conference, but — in perhaps a slip of the hand from Marvel — the captions on the trailer for <em>Loki</em> refer to Wilson&#8217;s character as &#8220;Mobius M. Mobius,&#8221; a mid-level manager of the TVA, who is one of dozens of clones (all taking the appearance of long-time Marvel writer/editor, and continuity expert, Mark Gruenwald, in a Marvel meta-joke). This isn&#8217;t confirmation that Wilson is playing Mobius M. Mobius, but it definitely suggests he is — especially with the cropped hair and mustache he shares with the <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/mr-mobius/4005-28215/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">comics character</a>.</p>\n<p>More hints are given as to the TVA&#8217;s powers, as Loki asks his captor how long he&#8217;s been there, and Wilson responds, &#8220;It&#8217;s hard to say, you know, time passes differently here in the TVA,&#8221; before pushing him through the elevator doors.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-649777\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/loki-trailer-breakdown-5-700x291.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"291\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/loki-trailer-breakdown-5-700x291.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/loki-trailer-breakdown-5-360x150.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/loki-trailer-breakdown-5-768x319.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/loki-trailer-breakdown-5.jpg 1440w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-649776\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/loki-trailer-breakdown-6-700x291.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"291\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/loki-trailer-breakdown-6-700x291.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/loki-trailer-breakdown-6-360x150.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/loki-trailer-breakdown-6-768x319.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/loki-trailer-breakdown-6.jpg 1440w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Suddenly we cut to a new setting, where a soldier enters a darkened tent. The trailer is cut in a way that suggests that as soon as Loki was thrust through the elevator doors, he was thrust into a new world (or reality), but that&#8217;s likely a bit of fancy editing. Still, it sets us up for an intriguing series of events, in which a unit of soldiers scope out this darkened outdoor area, lit only by gas lamps.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-649775\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/loki-trailer-breakdown-7-700x291.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"291\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/loki-trailer-breakdown-7-700x291.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/loki-trailer-breakdown-7-360x150.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/loki-trailer-breakdown-7-768x319.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/loki-trailer-breakdown-7.jpg 1440w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>This is where things become even more puzzling and difficult to explain. A hooded figure appears, apparently at the same setting that the soldiers are scoping out. The figure carries a gas lamp, which the figure then throws on the ground, lighting the grass on fire.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-649774\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/loki-trailer-breakdown-8-700x290.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"290\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/loki-trailer-breakdown-8-700x290.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/loki-trailer-breakdown-8-360x149.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/loki-trailer-breakdown-8-768x318.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/loki-trailer-breakdown-8.jpg 1440w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>As the fire spreads, one of the soldiers scrambles away — but he stands out from the rest. The helmet that tumbles off his head bears some resemblance to Captain America&#8217;s World War II helmet, and his uniform bears some parallels to that of the first Avenger&#8217;s, though the bearded brunette man beneath the helmet is clearly not Chris Evans. It&#8217;s possible that this is an alternate version of Captain America, being attacked by the hooded figure. This may confirm the rumors that the villain of the series — and the figure in the hood — is an alternate Loki from a different dimension, who has been <a href=\"https://www.digitalspy.com/tv/ustv/a31663127/loki-richard-e-grant-old/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">rumored to be played</a> by <strong>Richard E. Grant</strong>. Grant was confirmed to be part of the <em>Loki</em> cast last night, though Marvel was naturally tight-lipped on his role. However, the hints from this trailer lend nicely to the rumors that Grant is playing Old Man Loki, a villainous future form of Loki from an alternate timeline, who may be set up as the Big Bad for the series.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-649773\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/loki-trailer-breakdown-9-700x290.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"290\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/loki-trailer-breakdown-9-700x290.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/loki-trailer-breakdown-9-360x149.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/loki-trailer-breakdown-9-768x318.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/loki-trailer-breakdown-9.jpg 1440w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>But we have to be reminded that this Loki in the limited series is not the reformed Loki, but the one still hot off his crimes in <em>The Avengers</em>. He may not be as keen to help the TVA maintain cosmic order, as seen in this shot where Loki is back in his old outfit, looking in the mirror and remarking, &#8220;Glorious.&#8221;</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-649772\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/loki-trailer-breakdown-10-700x291.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"291\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/loki-trailer-breakdown-10-700x291.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/loki-trailer-breakdown-10-360x150.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/loki-trailer-breakdown-10-768x319.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/loki-trailer-breakdown-10.jpg 1440w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Back at the TVA, Loki appears to be taken to trial by the organization&#8217;s top authorities, with <strong>Gugu Mbatha-Raw</strong> presiding as judge. Behind her are three faces carved into the wooden wall, which is interesting since, in the comics, the TVA is literally a faceless bureaucracy — most of its agents being artificial clones without faces, sent to monitor each divergent reality. But a few higher-ranking judges enforce the TVA&#8217;s regulations including Justice Peace, Justice Love, Justice Goodwill, Justice Might, Justice Truth, and Justice Liberty. The TVA is also led by a mysterious being known as Mr. Alternity.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-649771\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/loki-trailer-breakdown-11-700x291.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"291\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/loki-trailer-breakdown-11-700x291.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/loki-trailer-breakdown-11-360x150.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/loki-trailer-breakdown-11-768x319.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/loki-trailer-breakdown-11.jpg 1440w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Mbatha-Raw may be playing one of these justices — who, in the comics, sometimes have a tendency to go rogue and commit the crimes they&#8217;re meant to prevent.

Who is this ethereal-looking girl? A guardian of some dimension or reality? One that is evil, considering the demonic figure on the glass? It&#8217;s too hard to say for now, but it&#8217;s clear that <em>Loki</em> is stepping up its visuals in a big way.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-649766\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/loki-trailer-breakdown-16-700x292.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"292\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/loki-trailer-breakdown-16-700x292.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/loki-trailer-breakdown-16-360x150.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/loki-trailer-breakdown-16-768x320.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/loki-trailer-breakdown-16.jpg 1440w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Loki is getting tossed around the TVA a lot, landing in a depot with a metal detector covered in some red paint, standing over a scorched piece of floor.

Cooper — yes, <a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/history/famous-cases/db-cooper-hijacking\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>that</em></a> D.B. Cooper. The man behind the hijacking of the Boeing 727 aircraft in 1971, who managed to extort $200,000 in ransom money and parachute out of the airplane, never to be seen again. The manhunt for Cooper and his disappearance has remained one of the greatest unsolved cases of the 20th century, but here we get a magical little spin on it: that Loki was D.B. Cooper, and that his disappearance is explained by Heimdall suddenly beaming him up to Asgard as he jumps out of the plane.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-649759\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/loki-trailer-breakdown-23-700x292.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"292\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/loki-trailer-breakdown-23-700x292.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/loki-trailer-breakdown-23-360x150.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/loki-trailer-breakdown-23-768x321.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/loki-trailer-breakdown-23.jpg 1440w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>When <em>Loki</em> was first announced, we&#8217;d heard many descriptions of it being a &#8220;time-hopping&#8221; adventure, and thus far we&#8217;d seen little of that, except for the D.B. Cooper scene. But in a short scene of Loki tossing a tunic-wearing woman out of the way, we get another glimpse of what appears to be a historical setting that the god of mischief has found himself in (still wearing the TVA agent gear).</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-649758\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/loki-trailer-breakdown-24-700x291.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"291\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/loki-trailer-breakdown-24-700x291.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/loki-trailer-breakdown-24-360x150.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/loki-trailer-breakdown-24-768x319.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/loki-trailer-breakdown-24.jpg 1440w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Has Loki become an agent for the TVA, finding himself in increasingly absurd situations? That seems to be the case with this one sequence which sees a man dressed remarkably like M&#8217;Baku from <em>Black Panther</em> taking a hammer to a Loki lookalike, knocking the antler helm off his head, as the real Loki looks on in shock behind the fray. There are vines and wreckage bursting through ceilings and walls of this room, which suggests realities colliding in some way.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-649756\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/loki-trailer-breakdown-26-700x292.jpg\" alt=\"loki trailer breakdown\" width=\"700\" height=\"292\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/loki-trailer-breakdown-26-700x292.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/loki-trailer-breakdown-26-360x150.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/loki-trailer-breakdown-26-768x320.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/loki-trailer-breakdown-26.jpg 1440w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>The final scene of the trailer, in which Loki wears a green suit and his antler helm, with a political &#8220;Loki&#8221; sticker on his chest, appears to be a deliberate nod to the <em>Vote Loki</em> comic book arc by Christopher Hastings, a four-part 2016 comic book run that parodied the 2016 presidential elections and followed Loki&#8217;s controversial political campaign for President of the United States.</p>\n<p>Another alternate reality that Loki finds himself in? Or perhaps a sign of the decaying barriers between realities, as he is in the same destroyed room as before (filled with artifacts from across history) surrounded by various historical warriors, also wearing Loki stickers, who quickly turn on the Norse god after he smugly remarks, &#8220;What did you expect?&#8221;</p>\n<p>We don&#8217;t know what we expected, nor what to expect,

2017&#8217;s <em>Thor: Ragnarok</em>, a new report says Alexander will be coming back to reprise her role as the Asgardian warrior Lady Sif in writer/director <strong>Taika Waititi</strong>&#8216;s upcoming sequel <em><strong>Thor: Love and Thunder</strong></em>. And there&#8217;s one other place she might pop up, too.<br />\n<span id=\"more-649906\"></span></p>\n<p>Deadline reports that Alexander is set to return to the MCU in <em>Thor: Love and Thunder</em>, the new film from Taika Waititi which will introduce <strong>Christian Bale</strong> to the franchise <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/christian-bale-thor-love-and-thunder-villain-gorr-the-god-butcher/\">as the villainous Gorr the God Butcher</a>. The report also states that Sif might have a guest spot in <strong><em>Loki</em></strong>, the Disney+ series in which <strong>Tom Hiddleston</strong>&#8216;s villain criss-crosses through time. That makes sense, given that Sif first appeared in <em>Thor</em>, the project which introduced Loki in the MCU, and the two have already come face to face on screen before.</p>\n<p>Alexander&#8217;s Lady Sif also appeared in <em>Thor: The Dark World </em>and two episodes of the TV series <em>Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</em>, and she was evidently a fan favorite. But frankly – and this was no fault of the actress – Sif simply didn&#8217;t have enough to do in those early <em>Thor</em> movies for her to leave much of an imprint in my mind. Thankfully, Taika Waititi injected the self-serious and occasionally dour <em>Thor</em> franchise with a much-needed dose of humor with <em>Thor: Ragnarok</em>, and elevated that franchise out of the MCU gutter and more toward top-tier material. Here&#8217;s hoping he&#8217;ll be able to give Sif much more to chew on this time around than she&#8217;s had before.</p>\n<p>Alexander, who recently starred on the NBC series <em>Blindspot</em>, won&#8217;t be the only woman returning to the <em>Thor</em> franchise in this next entry. <strong>Natalie Portman</strong>, who also sat out the events of <em>Thor: Ragnarok</em>, <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/thor-love-thunder-will-give-natalie-portman-a-different-version-of-thors-powers/\">will be back</a> in <em>Thor: Love and Thunder</em>, and she&#8217;ll be wielding the powerful hammer Mjolnir as a superhero known as The Mighty Thor. She&#8217;ll presumably be taking the mantle because <strong>Chris Hemsworth</strong>, who is coming back to reprise the title role, will likely be off spending some time in space with his new pals, the Guardians of the Galaxy. <strong>Chris Pratt</strong>&#8216;s Peter Quill (AKA Star-Lord) <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/thor-love-and-thunder-cast-chris-pratt/\">is showing up</a> in this new movie, and we expect more Guardians to be announced soon as well.</p>\n<p>Production on the new sequel is set to start next month.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/lady-sif-returns-to-the-mcu/\">&#8216;Thor: Love and Thunder&#8217; Will Return Jaimie Alexander&#8217;s Lady Sif to the MCU</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=JVYxkRZbHak:YGwPUWjwLQA:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=JVYxkRZbHak:YGwPUWjwLQA:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=JVYxkRZbHak:YGwPUWjwLQA:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=JVYxkRZbHak:YGwPUWjwLQA:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=JVYxkRZbHak:YGwPUWjwLQA:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=JVYxkRZbHak:YGwPUWjwLQA:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/JVYxkRZbHak\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 11 Dec 2020 22:30:59 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Lady-Sif-returns-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"27b943092346bb83d9c06014e014781d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn14@2020_4/2020/12/12/07-45-49-067_fe164d02f87d2a5c.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":32330,"destBytes":20110,"author":"Ben Pearson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Lady-Sif-returns-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn14@2020_4/2020/12/12/07-45-49-067_fe164d02f87d2a5c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn26@2020_5/2020/12/12/07-46-09-160_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=JVYxkRZbHak:YGwPUWjwLQA:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn1@2020_2/2020/12/12/07-46-09-096_fed6be3026db7d5c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn21@2020_5/2020/12/12/07-46-11-127_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=JVYxkRZbHak:YGwPUWjwLQA:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn36@2020_6/2020/12/12/07-46-07-342_9a9d488a8ba5de78.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/JVYxkRZbHak":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn2@2020_1/2020/12/12/07-46-08-243_286b71d19921260c.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1607759120493},{"createdTime":"2020-12-12 15:45:20","updatedTime":"2020-12-12 15:45:20","title":"Superhero Bits: ‘Hawkeye’ Canine Actor Has an Instagram, ‘Wonder Woman 1984’ Virtual Premiere & More","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=649339","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-649917 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/scarletwitch-conceptart-andypark-comicoutfit-frontpage-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"Scarlet Witch - Andy Park Concept Art\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/scarletwitch-conceptart-andypark-comicoutfit-frontpage.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/scarletwitch-conceptart-andypark-comicoutfit-frontpage-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Why is there a different <strong>Deadshot</strong> in the upcoming <strong><em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</em></strong> game?

She&#8217;s turned in great work in films like <em>First Reformed</em>, <em>Twin Peaks</em>, and this year&#8217;s <em>Mank</em> (and, yes, the <em>Mama Mia!</em> films). And at one point, she was almost part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, too. Seyfried has previously commented on turning down the role of Gamora in James Gunn&#8217;s <strong><em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em></strong>, and in a new interview, she goes into more detail as to why: she was worried the movie was going to bomb.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-648987\"></span></p>\n<p>Once upon a time, Amanda Seyfried almost played Gamora in Guardians<em> of the Galaxy</em>. She turned the part down, though, and has said in the past she didn&#8217;t want to sit in a make-up chair for hours for the part. &#8220;I was just like, &#8216;Ah, I don’t wanna be green. It&#8217;s just so much work,'&#8221; Seyfried told <a href=\"https://heroichollywood.com/amanda-seyfried-guardians-of-the-galaxy-gamora-passed-role/\">ComicBook</a> earlier this year. &#8220;I remember Jennifer Lawrence talking about once, how long it took her to get blue [for the <em>X-Men</em> movies]. And I was like, &#8216;That seems like hell on earth,&#8217; because then you get to set and you&#8217;re only there for a couple hours, and then you have to take everything off. And that was literally the reason.&#8221;</p>\n<p>But in a new interview with <a href=\"https://www.stitcher.com/show/awards-chatter/episode/amanda-seyfried-mank-79901490\">THR</a> (via <a href=\"https://www.indiewire.com/2020/12/amanda-seyfried-rejected-guardians-of-the-galaxy-box-office-bomb-1234603056/\">IndieWire</a>), Seyfried gave another reason for passing on the MCU: fear of failure. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t want to be part of the first Marvel movie that bombed,&#8221; Seyfried said. &#8220;I said, &#8216;Who wants to see a movie about a talking tree and a raccoon?&#8217; Which is clearly — I was very wrong.&#8221;</p>\n<p>While Seyfried&#8217;s decision seems short-sighted right now, she definitely had a point at the time. While the Marvel brand was strong before <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> came out, there was some concern that the movie would not find an audience. While previous Marvel movies had focused on characters that were pretty well known – Iron Man, Captain America, and so on – the Guardians weren&#8217;t exactly household names at the time. It really looked like a risk for Marvel. Of course, we now know it all worked out in the end – <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> ended up being the third-highest-grossing film of 2014.</p>\n<p>But Seyfried didn&#8217;t know that at the time. &#8220;The script was great, it was all based in not wanting to be &#8216;that guy,'&#8221; she added in the new interview. &#8220;Because if you are the star of a giant movie like that, and it bombs, Hollywood does not forgive you. I’ve seen that happen to people and it was a giant, giant fear and I thought, is it worth it?&#8221;</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/amanda-seyfried-guardians-of-the-galaxy/\">Amanda Seyfried Turned Down &#8216;Guardians of the Galaxy&#8217; Because She Thought It Would Bomb</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=eWMX2-LFP7o:wzG7FH_10Gk:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=eWMX2-LFP7o:wzG7FH_10Gk:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=eWMX2-LFP7o:wzG7FH_10Gk:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=eWMX2-LFP7o:wzG7FH_10Gk:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=eWMX2-LFP7o:wzG7FH_10Gk:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=eWMX2-LFP7o:wzG7FH_10Gk:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/eWMX2-LFP7o\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 12 Dec 2020 00:30:02 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/amanda-seyfreid-guardians-of-the-galaxy-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"40f850397844151ca6b7184e1b29d009","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn50@2020_1/2020/12/12/07-45-40-933_71fcfba92690a987.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":20857,"destBytes":10352,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/amanda-seyfreid-guardians-of-the-galaxy-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn50@2020_1/2020/12/12/07-45-40-933_71fcfba92690a987.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn26@2020_5/2020/12/12/07-46-09-160_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=eWMX2-LFP7o:wzG7FH_10Gk:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn46@2020_5/2020/12/12/07-46-09-382_5229f640425acf1b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn21@2020_5/2020/12/12/07-46-11-127_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=eWMX2-LFP7o:wzG7FH_10Gk:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn58@2020_2/2020/12/12/07-46-08-673_ff6f13d451a566b0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/eWMX2-LFP7o":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn78@2020_3/2020/12/12/07-46-09-539_c6a3bd8bca0dd1a7.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1607759120494},{"createdTime":"2020-12-12 15:45:20","updatedTime":"2020-12-12 15:45:20","title":"‘Ambulance’, the Latest From Michael Bay, Adds Yahya Abdul-Mateen II Alongside Jake Gyllenhaal","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=649910","description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/ambulance-cast-Yahya-Abdul-Mateen-II.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-649931\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/ambulance-cast-Yahya-Abdul-Mateen-II-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"ambulance cast Yahya Abdul-Mateen II\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/ambulance-cast-Yahya-Abdul-Mateen-II-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/ambulance-cast-Yahya-Abdul-Mateen-II-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/ambulance-cast-Yahya-Abdul-Mateen-II-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/ambulance-cast-Yahya-Abdul-Mateen-II.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>Yahya Abdul-Mateen II</strong> is catching a ride on <strong>Michael Bay</strong>&#8216;s <strong><em>Ambulance</em></strong>.

THR is reporting that Abdul-Mateen is joining Jake Gyllenhaal in Michael Bay&#8217;s <em>Ambulance</em>.</p>\n<p>The movie is a remake of the 2005 Danish film <em>Ambulancen</em>, in which two brothers commit a robbery to pay for an operation for their dying mother. They end up hijacking an ambulance, only to then realize that a dying heart transplant patient and a hospital intern are both in the back of the vehicle. The script for the remake, penned by Chris Fedak, has been floating around for a while, with this synopsis:</p>\n<blockquote><p>A vet just back from Afghanistan is drawn by his brother into a bank robbery in downtown Los Angeles. When the robbery goes horribly wrong, the brothers take hostages and hijack an ambulance. As the situation escalates, old wounds reopen in the relationship between the brothers as they fight to survive what seems like an impossible situation.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Now, according to <strong>THR</strong>, the script has undergone a rewrite so that the lead characters are no longer brothers, opening the door for Abdul-Mateen to play Gyllenhaal&#8217;s partner in crime. The plot remains mostly the same, and in addition to the sick patient in the back, there&#8217;s also a paramedic. The paramedic part will be played by <strong>Eiza González </strong><em>(Baby</em> <em>Driver</em>)<em>.</em></p>\n<p>As previously <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/ambulance-jake-gyllenhaal/\">reported</a>, the film is said to have the potential to recall &#8220;great action thrillers of the ’90s like <em>Speed</em> and Bay’s <em>Bad Boys</em>,&#8221; so it makes sense that Bay is drawn to this. I think Bay <em>can</em> turn in a good film now and then – I&#8217;ll admit it, I love <em>The Rock – </em>but he also delivers plenty of junk. I couldn&#8217;t even make it through <em>6 Underground</em>. Hopefully, <em>Ambulance</em> turns out to be one of his better offerings. Throwing Gyllenhaal and Abdul-Mateen into the mix certainly doesn&#8217;t hurt.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/ambulance-cast-yahya-abdul-mateen-ii/\">&#8216;Ambulance&#8217;, the Latest From Michael Bay, Adds Yahya Abdul-Mateen II Alongside Jake Gyllenhaal</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=A1qQTJAmW0U:yqywJVu4Orc:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=A1qQTJAmW0U:yqywJVu4Orc:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=A1qQTJAmW0U:yqywJVu4Orc:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=A1qQTJAmW0U:yqywJVu4Orc:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=A1qQTJAmW0U:yqywJVu4Orc:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=A1qQTJAmW0U:yqywJVu4Orc:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/A1qQTJAmW0U\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 11 Dec 2020 23:00:16 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/ambulance-cast-Yahya-Abdul-Mateen-II-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"fd577f2b93299d70c6fbf3d0dad39c83","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn26@2020_3/2020/12/12/07-45-35-036_0b57be6c1032f678.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":33591,"destBytes":21650,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/ambulance-cast-Yahya-Abdul-Mateen-II-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn26@2020_3/2020/12/12/07-45-35-036_0b57be6c1032f678.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn26@2020_5/2020/12/12/07-46-09-160_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=A1qQTJAmW0U:yqywJVu4Orc:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn98@2020_3/2020/12/12/07-46-11-064_a67080412475c7c1.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn21@2020_5/2020/12/12/07-46-11-127_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=A1qQTJAmW0U:yqywJVu4Orc:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn33@2020_5/2020/12/12/07-46-10-515_88c36cd3ec336868.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/A1qQTJAmW0U":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn16@2020_6/2020/12/12/07-46-08-331_dc6fd824e56085c6.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1607759120497},{"createdTime":"2020-12-12 15:45:20","updatedTime":"2020-12-12 15:45:20","title":"Is Marvel Studios Building Toward a Young Avengers Movie?","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=649844","description":"<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-649872\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/young-avengers-1-e1607716609561-700x372.jpg\" alt=\"young avengers\" width=\"700\" height=\"372\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/young-avengers-1-e1607716609561-700x372.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/young-avengers-1-e1607716609561-360x191.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/young-avengers-1-e1607716609561-768x408.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/young-avengers-1-e1607716609561.jpg 790w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><i>Avengers: Endgame</i> brought an end of an era — one that changed up who would take on the mantle of Earth&#8217;s mightiest heroes. There are already several beloved superheroes and galactic teams jostling for that responsibility, but what about the next generation? The children are the future, after all, and — thanks to a five-year time jump — they&#8217;re all grown up.</p>\n<p><strong>The Young Avengers </strong>—a group of superhero protégés who came together in the comics to save the world after the main adult team broke apart — has been <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/mcu-future-young-avengers-lgbt-kevin-feige/\">teased and rumored</a> heavily for the past few years. But for the first time, with the confirmation of core team members like Kate Bishop (<strong>Hailee Steinfeld</strong>), Cassie Lang (<strong>Kathryn Newton</strong>), and America Chavez (<strong>Xochitl Gomez</strong>), we&#8217;re seeing serious steps on Marvel Studios&#8217; part to bring them together.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-649844\"></span></p>\n<p>The next Hawkeye, Scott Lang&#8217;s daughter and protége, and a super-strong Latin-American teen may form the core of Marvel Studios&#8217; Young Avengers.

These castings were all confirmed at the Disney Investors conference Thursday, and hint that a Young Avengers team-up is surely inevitable.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-629982\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/hawkeye-katebishop-conceptart-highres-frontpage-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"Hawkeye - Kate Bishop Concept Art\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/hawkeye-katebishop-conceptart-highres-frontpage.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/hawkeye-katebishop-conceptart-highres-frontpage-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<h2>Who are the Young Avengers (So Far)?</h2>\n<p><strong>Kate Bishop</strong>, and <strong>Cassie Lang</strong> were two of the core members of the Young Avengers, a team of teen superheroes who first got together in series by Allan Heinberg and Jim Cheung. After the events of the 2004–2005 &#8220;Avengers Disassembled&#8221; storyline, these teens decided to fill the hole left by the dissolution of the main Avengers team. If the adults weren&#8217;t going to save the world, the kids would.</p>\n<p>Kate Bishop was a rich debutante-turned-archer vigilante who would make a name for herself as Hawkeye before being taken under Clint Barton&#8217;s wing. Meanwhile, Cassie Lang had the same powers as her father Scott Lang, the power to change size at will, taking on the name Stature.</p>\n<p><strong>America Chavez</strong> (also known as Miss America), a super-strong alien with the power to fly and create portals between universe with her kicks, would join as a lead member in the new <em>Young Avengers</em> series by Kieron Gillen and drawn by Jamie McKelvie, which launched in 2013. She would become the first major Latin-American LGBTQ character in Marvel Comics and quickly establish a rapport (and arguably, romantic tension) with Kate Bishop in the second Young Avengers line-up.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-620529\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/ironheart-conceptart-rafgrassetti-700x332.jpg\" alt=\"Ironheart Artwork\" width=\"700\" height=\"332\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/ironheart-conceptart-rafgrassetti-700x332.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/ironheart-conceptart-rafgrassetti-360x171.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/ironheart-conceptart-rafgrassetti-768x364.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/ironheart-conceptart-rafgrassetti.jpg 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<h2>Who Else Could Join?</h2>\n<p>Kate Bishop will be joining the MCU through the Disney+ series <em>Hawkeye</em>, while Cassie Lang and America Chavez will both get big-screen time with <em>Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania</em> and <em>Doctor Strange</em><em> in the Multiverse of Madness</em>, respectively. Notably,<strong> Kang the Conqueror</strong> (<strong>Jonathan Majors</strong>) — a notorious foe for the Young Avengers — will be the main villain of <em>Ant-Man 3</em>, which suggests that <em>Quantumania</em> may be our big lead-in to this team-up. In the comics, a young version of Kang, before he becomes a villain, time travels back to join the young Avengers as Iron Lad, leading to the Young Avengers facing the dilemma of realizing their team member is destined to be a villain.</p>\n<p>With the forthcoming <em>Loki</em> series potentially dealing with alternate realities and alternate Lokis, there&#8217;s a chance that we could be introduced to <strong>Young Loki</strong>, another core member of the Young Avengers team, albeit one who is taken on as part-hostage, part-wary ally. I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if <em>Loki</em> ended with the introduction of Young Loki, ripe for a Young Avengers team-up.</p>\n<p>And while this character hasn&#8217;t been associated with Young Avengers before, the announcement of an <strong><em>Ironheart</em></strong> series, which follow the character of Riri Williams (a young Black girl who’s a genius inventor who creates a suit of armor that rivals Tony Stark&#8217;s) suggests we may see the character played by <strong>Dominique Thorne </strong>join the team.</p>\n<p>With Iron Man dead and Captain America retired, and the rest of the main Avengers doing their own spin-off shows before likely retiring too, there&#8217;s a huge void that the Young Avengers are primed to fill.

That means some little tidbits got lost in the shuffle, such as Disney announcing their plans to make Hulu the exclusive streaming home to original movies from 20th Century Studios and Searchlight, the studios formerly known as 20th Century Fox and Fox Searchlight.<span id=\"more-649825\"></span></p>\n<p>Following the success of original movies like <em>Palm Springs</em>, <em>Bad Hair</em>, and <em>Run</em> this year, Hulu President <strong>Kelly Campbell</strong> announced the streaming service&#8217;s slate of original movies would expand with offerings they&#8217;ll co-produce with 20th Century Studios and Searchlight Pictures, which came with their acquisition of 21st Century Fox.</p>\n<p>What&#8217;s not clear is if these movies from 20th Century Studios and Searchlight Pictures will be streaming exclusive titles or if they&#8217;ll be released in theaters and be branded as Hulu originals. The three aforementioned titles played on Hulu only, but it&#8217;s not clear if that would have been the case if the coronavirus pandemic hadn&#8217;t struck such a blow to movie theaters this year.</p>\n<p>Considering the recent move by Warner Bros. to <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/warner-bros-2021/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">send movies to HBO Max</a> the same day they hit theaters in 2021, and Disney beefing up their Disney+ Premier Access offerings, maybe there&#8217;s a chance Disney will have 20th Century Studios and Searchlight Pictures do some hybrid theatrical and streaming releases of their own? If not, maybe Hulu is just following in the same footsteps as Disney+ by having more original movies produced solely for streaming.</p>\n<p>Hulu said more details on this deal would be revealed in the coming months. The first 20th Century Studios title in 2021 is <em>The King&#8217;s Man</em> in January, followed by <em>Everybody&#8217;s Talking About Jamie</em> in February and there have been rumblings about the former going to Hulu and the latter possibly to Disney+. Meanwhile, Searchlight has both <em>Antlers</em> and <em>Nomadland</em> intended for release in February, and those could easily get streaming releases on Hulu. We&#8217;ll be sure to keep you posted when more details surface.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/hulu-releasing-20th-century-studios-movies-and-searchlight-too/\">Hulu Will Exclusively Release 20th Century Studios and Searchlight Pictures Movies as Originals</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=_vQ27ppep8I:CpwKqExJyGw:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=_vQ27ppep8I:CpwKqExJyGw:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=_vQ27ppep8I:CpwKqExJyGw:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=_vQ27ppep8I:CpwKqExJyGw:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=_vQ27ppep8I:CpwKqExJyGw:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=_vQ27ppep8I:CpwKqExJyGw:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/_vQ27ppep8I\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 11 Dec 2020 19:30:17 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/hulu-prices-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"8431d6075db09927d548d0b80e871838","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn41@2020_1/2020/12/12/07-45-43-395_2d2502fe611ac191.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":11185,"destBytes":4616,"author":"Ethan Anderton","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/hulu-prices-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn41@2020_1/2020/12/12/07-45-43-395_2d2502fe611ac191.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn26@2020_5/2020/12/12/07-46-09-160_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=_vQ27ppep8I:CpwKqExJyGw:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn41@2020_4/2020/12/12/07-46-08-516_9d6b8d5b3a1a0af1.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn21@2020_5/2020/12/12/07-46-11-127_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=_vQ27ppep8I:CpwKqExJyGw:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn50@2020_5/2020/12/12/07-46-09-655_d059e4508282e3d8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/_vQ27ppep8I":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn20@2020_1/2020/12/12/07-46-09-838_b863342517bee236.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1607759120491},{"createdTime":"2020-12-12 15:45:20","updatedTime":"2020-12-12 15:45:20","title":"‘The Falcon and the Winter Soldier’ Trailer Breakdown: “The Legacy of That Shield is Complicated”","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=649824","description":"<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-649861 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/The-Falcon-and-the-Winter-Soldier-trailer-breakdown-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"The Falcon and the Winter Soldier trailer breakdown\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/The-Falcon-and-the-Winter-Soldier-trailer-breakdown.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/The-Falcon-and-the-Winter-Soldier-trailer-breakdown-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Last night, Disney debuted the <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-falcon-and-the-winter-soldier-trailer-full/\">first full trailer</a> for <em><strong>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</strong></em>, one of several big Marvel Studios shows that are being made specifically for the Disney+ streaming service.

And speaking of complications: it looks like a different character is wielding Cap&#8217;s shield later in the trailer, so this might be a scene depicting Sam breaking into this exhibition to take the one that&#8217;s on display for himself.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-649832 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Falcon-and-the-Winter-Soldier-TB-2-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Falcon-and-the-Winter-Soldier-TB-2.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Falcon-and-the-Winter-Soldier-TB-2-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-649834 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Falcon-and-the-Winter-Soldier-TB-3-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Falcon-and-the-Winter-Soldier-TB-3.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Falcon-and-the-Winter-Soldier-TB-3-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>&#8220;The world is upside down,&#8221; Bucky says gravely.

But it all ends with a moment of levity, with Falcon and Winter Soldier engaging in their usual bickering. The question I have is: why are they walking down a random country road? Did their mode of transportation break down? Did something happen to Sam&#8217;s wings? What exactly is the scenario that would result in two Avengers being put in this position?</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll find out when <em>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</em> hits Disney+ on <strong>March

It&#8217;s a great idea, and bringing in the MCU actors to voice their animated counterparts makes the whole endeavor even more enjoyable.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s dive into the trailer and see what we can decipher.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-649798\"></span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Screen-Shot-2020-12-11-at-11.02.54-AM.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-649802\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Screen-Shot-2020-12-11-at-11.02.54-AM-700x313.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"313\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Screen-Shot-2020-12-11-at-11.02.54-AM-700x313.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Screen-Shot-2020-12-11-at-11.02.54-AM-360x161.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Screen-Shot-2020-12-11-at-11.02.54-AM-768x343.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Screen-Shot-2020-12-11-at-11.03.05-AM.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-649803\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Screen-Shot-2020-12-11-at-11.03.05-AM-700x314.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"314\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Screen-Shot-2020-12-11-at-11.03.05-AM-700x314.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Screen-Shot-2020-12-11-at-11.03.05-AM-360x161.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Screen-Shot-2020-12-11-at-11.03.05-AM-768x344.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Screen-Shot-2020-12-11-at-11.03.16-AM.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-649804\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Screen-Shot-2020-12-11-at-11.03.16-AM-700x311.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"311\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Screen-Shot-2020-12-11-at-11.03.16-AM-700x311.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Screen-Shot-2020-12-11-at-11.03.16-AM-360x160.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Screen-Shot-2020-12-11-at-11.03.16-AM-768x341.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Screen-Shot-2020-12-11-at-11.03.30-AM.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-649805\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Screen-Shot-2020-12-11-at-11.03.30-AM-700x307.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"307\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Screen-Shot-2020-12-11-at-11.03.30-AM-700x307.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Screen-Shot-2020-12-11-at-11.03.30-AM-360x158.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Screen-Shot-2020-12-11-at-11.03.30-AM-768x336.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Screen-Shot-2020-12-11-at-11.03.48-AM.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-649806\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Screen-Shot-2020-12-11-at-11.03.48-AM-700x309.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"309\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Screen-Shot-2020-12-11-at-11.03.48-AM-700x309.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Screen-Shot-2020-12-11-at-11.03.48-AM-360x159.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Screen-Shot-2020-12-11-at-11.03.48-AM-768x339.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Part of the fun of this trailer is that it starts off with shots designed to trick you. Sure, it&#8217;s all animated, but the imagery we&#8217;re seeing is <em>familiar</em>. There&#8217;s Nick Fury (designed to resemble <strong>Samuel L. Jackson</strong>) uncovering Captain America&#8217;s frozen shield, presumably after Cap ended up frozen at the end of <em>The First Avenger</em>. There&#8217;s Doctor Strange&#8217;s Eye of Agamotto. There&#8217;s Star-Lord from <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em>. There&#8217;s the shot of Tony Stark chowing down on a donut from <em>Iron Man 2</em>. And then&#8230;things change. &#8220;Space. Time. Reality,&#8221; a whispery voice tells us. &#8220;It&#8217;s more than a linear path. &#8220;It&#8217;s a prism of endless possibility.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Screen-Shot-2020-12-11-at-11.03.58-AM.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-649807\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Screen-Shot-2020-12-11-at-11.03.58-AM-700x310.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"310\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Screen-Shot-2020-12-11-at-11.03.58-AM-700x310.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Screen-Shot-2020-12-11-at-11.03.58-AM-360x159.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Screen-Shot-2020-12-11-at-11.03.58-AM-768x340.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p>The first indication that things are not what they seem comes here – Star-Lord removes his mask, and – shocker! – it&#8217;s not Chris Pratt&#8217;s Peter Quill.

In the original <em>What If&#8230;?</em> comics, the Watcher was kind of like the Crypt Keeper without the puns – he&#8217;d set the story up, and then it would go from there. More Watchers were glimpsed – in live-action form – in <em>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2</em>. In an <a href=\"https://discussingfilm.net/2019/09/06/5806/\">interview</a>, <em>What If&#8230;?</em> series writer <strong>A.C. Bradley</strong> said of the character:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;He’s above everything else. He&#8217;s above everyone, but there should almost be a gleefulness watching these stories. I keep using this metaphor, which I&#8217;m not too sure if anyone likes, but I always compare it to the pizza rat meme that went around a few years ago. Someone next to the subway recorded this video of a rat dragging a slice of pizza across the platform. I think that&#8217;s what The Watcher is – he&#8217;s a guy watching a rat drag a slice of pizza across the platform.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>So there you have it: the Watcher is Pizza Rat.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Screen-Shot-2020-12-11-at-11.06.07-AM.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-649816\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Screen-Shot-2020-12-11-at-11.06.07-AM-700x313.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"313\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Screen-Shot-2020-12-11-at-11.06.07-AM-700x313.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Screen-Shot-2020-12-11-at-11.06.07-AM-360x161.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Screen-Shot-2020-12-11-at-11.06.07-AM-768x344.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p>From here, the trailer goes into the standard &#8220;let&#8217;s throw a bunch of quick shots in your face!&#8221; route that all trailers do these days.

All through the trailer, there are various shots of Doctor Strange doing&#8230;stuff. I honestly have no damn idea what he&#8217;s doing, other than waving his hands around and being mystical. But none of it seemed particularly <em>different</em> from what we expect from the character. This final beat finally clues us into what&#8217;s going on here: Doctor Strange ends up fighting&#8230;Doctor Strange. Only this other Doctor Strange has a bunch of red-glowing magic at his disposal, which suggests he&#8217;s <em>evil</em>. How does all of this work? We&#8217;ll have to wait and see.</p>\n<p><em>What If&#8230;?</em> premieres summer <strong>2021</strong> on Disney+.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\"

lead actors.</p>\n<p><strong>Matt Smith</strong> (<em>Doctor Who</em>, <em>The Crown</em>), <strong>Olivia Cooke</strong> (<em>Ready Player One</em>), and <strong>Emma D&#8217;Arcy</strong> (<em>Truth Seekers</em>) are about to take a trip to Westeros to star in a story set 300 years before the events of <em>Game of Thrones</em>. Read on for details about which characters they&#8217;ll be playing.<br />\n<span id=\"more-649886\"></span></p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/game-of-thrones-prequel-olivia-cooke-emma-darcy-and-matt-smith-to-star?utm_source=Sailthru&#38;utm_medium=email&#38;utm_campaign=THR%20Breaking%20News&#38;utm_term=hollywoodreporter_breakingnews\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, Smith, Cooke, and D&#8217;Arcy have just become the latest <em>Game of Thrones</em> prequel series cast members. Smith, whose credits also include <em>Terminator Genisys</em> and Edgar Wright&#8217;s upcoming <em>Last Night in Soho</em>, will play Prince Daemon Targaryen,<strong> </strong>who is described as the &#8220;younger brother to King Viserys and heir to the throne. A peerless warrior and a dragonrider, Daemon possesses the true blood of the dragon. But it is said that whenever a Targaryen is born, the gods toss a coin in the air.&#8221;</p>\n<p>D&#8217;Arcy (<em>Wanderlust</em>, <em>Hanna</em>) will play Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen, who is &#8220;the king&#8217;s first-born child, she is of pure Valyrian blood, and she is a dragonrider. Many would say that Rhaenyra was born with everything&#8230;but she was not born a man.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Cooke (who is great in Amazon&#8217;s new <em>Sound of Metal</em>) is playing a member of a different House. She&#8217;ll play Alicent Hightower, who is described by HBO as &#8220;the daughter of Otto Hightower, the Hand of the King, and the most comely woman in the Seven Kingdoms. She was raised in the Red Keep, close to the king and his innermost circle; she possesses both a courtly grace and a keen political acumen.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The report also reveals that <strong>Greg Yaitanes</strong> (<em>Banshee</em>) has come on board the series as a director and co-executive producer. <strong>Clare Kilner</strong> (<em>Snowpiercer</em>) and <strong>Geeta Patel</strong> (<em>The Witcher</em>) have also been hired as directors. They&#8217;ll join <em>Game of Thrones</em> veteran <strong>Miguel Sapochnik</strong> behind the camera; Sapochnik will direct episodes of the series and also serve as co-showrunner alongside <strong>Ryan Condal</strong> (<em>Colony</em>), who co-created this series with <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> author <strong>George R.R. Martin</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Paddy Considine</strong> (<em>The Outsider</em>, <em>Hot Fuzz</em>) has already been cast in the key role of King Viserys Targaryen, who was &#8220;chosen by the lords of Westeros to succeed the Old King, Jaehaerys Targaryen, at the Great Council at Harrenhal.

Ginger</em>, which will be directed by <em>The End of the F*cking World</em> creator <strong>Jonathan Entwistle</strong> and penned by <em>A Private War</em> writer Arash Amel, will tell &#8220;the untold, real love story between these two legends both on- and off-screen,&#8221;

Not all of those films are all-time greats, nor are the beloved classics imperfect either (each one is basically a rehash of <em>The Gay Divorcee</em>&#8216;s formula, in which Astaire&#8217;s character aggressively pursues Roger&#8217;s character, and they clash only to find a kinship through dance) but damn, did Astair and Rogers look good when they danced together. Their dance chemistry made up for some of the lazier formulas of their films, and resulted in iconic sequences like their <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOILZ_D3aRg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">roller-skate duet</a>, &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILxo-TUkzOQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Heaven</a>&#8221; from <em>Top Hat</em>, or my favorite of their&#8217;s, the <em>Swing Time</em> tap dance.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"555\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2QboC9Dldk4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>Bell&#8217;s casting here is no surprise, as the former child star got his breakout role as the ballet-dancing working class boy in <em>Billy Elliot</em>, and he&#8217;s maintained his dance and singing skills in other projects like the FX series <em>Fosse/Verdon </em>and films like <em>Rocketman</em>. Qualley, meanwhile, is more untested, though she managed to hold her own against Brad Pitt in <em>Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</em> (neither singing nor dancing, though).

Kathryn Hahn&#8217;s character is called Agnes, but many have predicted that she might be <a href=\"https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Agatha_Harkness_(Earth-616)\">Agatha Harkness</a>, a witch villain who has come to blows with Wanda in Marvel Comics. It&#8217;s interesting to me that they have her riding a bike through the neighborhood, perhaps as a nod to the Wicked Witch of the West in <em>The Wizard of Oz</em>.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-649748 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/wandavision-trailerbreakdown-vision-70s-house-700x509.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"509\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/wandavision-trailerbreakdown-vision-70s-house.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/wandavision-trailerbreakdown-vision-70s-house-360x262.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s one of the few shots we get of a human version of Vision in full retro wardrobe as he says hello to a couple of his neighbors.

This is the adult version of Maria Rambeau&#8217;s young daughter who we met in <em>Captain Marvel</em> and will have a key supporting role in <em>Captain Marvel 2</em>. We saw her get thrown out of Wanda&#8217;s sitcom construct in the previous trailer, indicating that maybe she&#8217;s maybe not supposed to be there.</p>\n<p>Monica&#8217;s presence gets all the more interesting here as she snaps out of her chummy sitcom character role when she realizes that she&#8217;s not sure why she&#8217;s there. We thought maybe she was working with the team of agents who gather around the neighborhood Wanda has seemingly created for herself, but now we&#8217;re not sure. In fact, we&#8217;re not sure if the neighborhood is entirely created by Wanda or if she&#8217;s manipulating a neighborhood that&#8217;s already there.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-649729 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/wandavision-trailerbreakdown-wanda-staticdiningtable-700x291.jpg\" alt=\"WandaVision Trailer Breakdown\" width=\"700\" height=\"291\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/wandavision-trailerbreakdown-wanda-staticdiningtable-700x291.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/wandavision-trailerbreakdown-wanda-staticdiningtable-360x150.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/wandavision-trailerbreakdown-wanda-staticdiningtable-768x319.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/wandavision-trailerbreakdown-wanda-staticdiningtable.jpg 1435w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>I love the build-up of the ominous tone of the series as the mental construct around Wanda begins to fall apart.

means for the rest of the next phase of Marvel Studios stories.</p>\n<p><em>WandaVision</em> starts streaming on Disney+ on <strong>January 15, 2021</strong>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\"

sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>&#8220;Warner Bros. might have just killed the <strong><em>Dune</em></strong> franchise.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Denis Villeneuve</strong>, the filmmaker behind the mega-budgeted movie adaptation of Frank Herbert&#8217;s classic science fiction novel, does not mince words in a new editorial published by <a href=\"https://variety.com/2020/film/news/dune-denis-villeneuve-blasts-warner-bros-1234851270/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Variety</a>. After being blindsided by the news that Warner Bros. is <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/warner-bros-2021/\">releasing its entire 2021 slate of films</a> (including <em>Dune</em>) in theaters and on HBO Max simultaneously, Villeneuve blasted the studio&#8217;s parent company in this new editorial, saying, &#8220;AT&#38;T has hijacked one of the most respectable and important studios in film history.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Read more of his comments below, and get the latest update about what AMC Theatres will need to stay viable through the next year.<span id=\"more-649871\"></span></p>\n<h2>Denis Villeneuve HBO Max Comments</h2>\n<p>&#8220;There is absolutely no love for cinema, nor for the audience here,&#8221; Villeneuve writes of the studio&#8217;s decision, saying that WB&#8217;s &#8220;sudden reversal from being a legacy home for filmmakers to the new era of complete disregard draws a clear line&#8221; and indicates that they are no longer on the same side.</p>\n<p>He acknowledges that streaming services are a &#8220;positive and powerful addition to the movie and TV ecosystems,&#8221; but wants to be clear that there&#8217;s a difference in the type of content that&#8217;s made for the big screen and the type that isn&#8217;t. &#8220;I want the audience to understand that streaming alone can’t sustain the film industry as we knew it before COVID. Streaming can produce great content, but not movies of <em>Dune</em>&#8216;s scope and scale.&#8221; He says <em>Dune</em> is &#8220;by far the best movie [he&#8217;s] ever made,&#8221; and emphasizes how much work went into preparing it for a theatrical release, including the multiple release date delays which were intended to allow the movie to open during a safer time in a post-pandemic world.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I strongly believe the future of cinema will be on the big screen, no matter what any Wall Street dilettante says,&#8221; he writes, ending with a call to action for AT&#38;T: &#8220;So, just as I have both a fiduciary and creative responsibility to fulfill as the filmmaker, I call on AT&#38;T to act swiftly with the same responsibility, respect and regard to protect this vital cultural medium. Economic impact to stakeholders is only one aspect of corporate social responsibility. Finding ways to enhance culture is another.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Sounds like that planned <em>Dune</em> sequel and HBO Max spin-off TV series about the Bene Gesserit may not happen after all.</p>\n<h2>AMC&#8217;s Future Looks Bleak</h2>\n<p>The country&#8217;s biggest theater chain has been hit hard by the pandemic, and in a new filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company lays out its future in pretty dire terms. Despite just raising $100 million, AMC says it needs $750 million to stay viable through 2021 – and even then, it could still face bankruptcy if the public doesn&#8217;t return to theaters in significant numbers throughout next year.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A significant spike in coronavirus cases, together with delays of major movie releases or the direct or simultaneous release of movie titles to the home video or streaming markets in lieu of theatre exhibition, have led to theatre closures, prevented the opening of theatres in major markets and have had, and are expected to continue to have in the future, a material adverse impact on theatre attendance levels and our business,&#8221; the filing stated (via Deadline). &#8220;These challenges have been exacerbated by the announcement by Warner Bros. that its entire studio film slate for 2021 will move to simultaneous release, which may result in other studios adopting a similar strategy.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Things continue to look bleak for theatrical exhibition, and we&#8217;ll have to wait and see if they can hang on long enough for people to return to theaters in droves once a vaccine is widely distributed.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/denis-villeneuve-hbo-max-reaction/\">&#8216;Dune&#8217;

The series created by star <strong>Rob McElhenney</strong> has officially been renewed for four more seasons, which will be enough to not only break the record as the longest-running live-action comedy series in American television history, but completely shatter it.<span id=\"more-649420\"></span></p>\n<p>Previously, McElhenney said negotiations were underway for season 15 and season 16, but apparently FX couldn&#8217;t help but order season 17 and season 18 along with &#8217;em. The 15th season is what will officially make the series a longer-running live-action comedy than the previous record holder, <em>The Adventures of Ozzie &#38; Harriet</em>.</p>\n<p>However, it should be noted that the classic ABC series ran for a total of 435 episodes across 14 seasons, with each season having anywhere between 25 and 39 episodes, so <em>It&#8217;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia</em> has a lot of catching up to do on that front. Even if each of the new four seasons has the standard 10-episode run the series has stuck to since the eighth season, that won&#8217;t even bring their total to half of that count. Thankfully, Rob McElhenney has plans for much more. He wrote on Twitter yesterday:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Sunny was originally pitched as a 36 season arc. So happy to be halfway done. <a href=\"https://t.co/xT7US6RPnP\">https://t.co/xT7US6RPnP</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Rob McElhenney (@RMcElhenney) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RMcElhenney/status/1337174807431925767?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 10, 2020</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>Obviously he&#8217;s joking about having an initial pitch for a show that long, but if there&#8217;s any series that has the perfect formula to make a run for that long,<em> It&#8217;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia</em> is certainly it. Co-star Glenn Howerton agrees completely, whether you like it or not. He wrote on Twitter:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">We will pummel you all into submission with this show. We will ram it down your dirty throats! <a href=\"https://t.co/1nf95pNgGR\">https://t.co/1nf95pNgGR</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Glenn with two n’s (@GlennHowerton) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GlennHowerton/status/1337190917917163520?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 11, 2020</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>Earlier this year, McElhenney addressed whether or not the next season of <em>It&#8217;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia</em> would address the coronavirus pandemic, but he reminded everyone that they actually already did a pandemic episode of sorts:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Well, we actually do have an episode called ‘The Gang Gets Quarantined’ [in season 9] where we quarantine ourselves in the bar.

For example, many were shocked to learn that Nolan is a huge fan of the goofy comedy <em>MacGruber</em>, so much that he even <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/christopher-nolans-macgruber-e-mail/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">sent an e-mail wishing luck to everyone</a> when production on Peacock&#8217;s sequel series pilot began. Now we&#8217;re learning that Nolan likes his junk food action cinema too, because he&#8217;s admitted to liking the <strong><em>Fast ad Furious</em></strong> movies, especially the original from 2001.<span id=\"more-649272\"></span></p>\n<p>Appearing on the <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/happy-sad-confused/id827905050\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Happy Sad Confused podcast</a>, Nolan was asked about a rumor that he&#8217;s a fan of the <em>Fast and Furious</em> franchise starring <strong>Vin Diesel </strong>and his ensemble of &#8220;family&#8221; members that has helped him through the thick, the thin, and the absolutely insane. Nolan actually likes how the movies have been getting bigger and crazier, even though he likes a couple of the early entries in the franchise more. Here&#8217;s what Nolan had to say (via <a href=\"https://comicbook.com/movies/news/the-dark-knight-director-chris-nolan-fast-furious-movies/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ComicBook.com</a>):</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I’m sort of an original recipe [guy], I mean the Rob Cohen original&#8230; But I’ve got a very soft spot for Tokyo Drift, actually. And then the skill as Justin Lin’s iterations, as they got crazier and bigger and crazier and bigger, they became something else, but something else kind of fun. The fun thing about those movies is even as they’ve gotten bigger and bigger and bigger, as sequels have to do, everyone always complains that sequels get bigger but we’re the people making sequels get bigger, we do want them bigger, you don’t want them smaller, it’s the Alien 3 lesson that [director David] Fincher learned. You can do it but it’s not going to make anybody happy, even though personally I love that film, a lot more than he does in fact.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>Though <em>Tokyo Drift </em>was panned upon release, it has since become a favorite of longtime fans, even without the presence of Vin Diesel or Paul Walker in the lead roles.</p>\n<p>But all good things must come to an end, and we only have three more movies in the <em>Fast and Furious</em> franchise to look forward to. Originally intended for release earlier this year, <em>F9</em> will be drifting into theaters on <strong>May 28, 2021</strong>. Then the franchise will be coming to a close <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/fast-and-furious-franchise-ending-with-two-part-finale/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">with a two-film finale</a> directed by <strong>Justin Lin</strong>. That means when the <em>Fast and Furious</em> franchise concludes, the movies will have literally turned it up to 11. And if they don&#8217;t work that into the marketing, someone should be fired.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s hoping we can keep finding out movies that Christopher Nolan loves. Maybe we should start taking bets. Could Nolan secretly be a fan of the <em>Big Momma&#8217;s House</em> movies?</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/christopher-nolan-loves-the-fast-and-furious-movies/\">Christopher Nolan Loves the &#8216;Fast and Furious&#8217; Movies, Especially the Original</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=qXVW8J2VAtk:lxqdmf3tR6k:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=qXVW8J2VAtk:lxqdmf3tR6k:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=qXVW8J2VAtk:lxqdmf3tR6k:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=qXVW8J2VAtk:lxqdmf3tR6k:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=qXVW8J2VAtk:lxqdmf3tR6k:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=qXVW8J2VAtk:lxqdmf3tR6k:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/qXVW8J2VAtk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 12 Dec 2020 01:30:17 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Christopher-Nolan-directing-The-Dark-Knight-Rises-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"b48c0507ec7de603bceab38fcd3ae38b","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn36@2020_5/2020/12/12/07-45-20-836_db870a738e342ecf.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":44643,"destBytes":21060,"author":"Ethan Anderton","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Christopher-Nolan-directing-The-Dark-Knight-Rises-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn36@2020_5/2020/12/12/07-45-20-836_db870a738e342ecf.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn26@2020_5/2020/12/12/07-46-09-160_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=qXVW8J2VAtk:lxqdmf3tR6k:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn34@2020_6/2020/12/12/07-46-09-488_1b5d426872de0e07.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn21@2020_5/2020/12/12/07-46-11-127_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=qXVW8J2VAtk:lxqdmf3tR6k:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn76@2020_2/2020/12/12/07-46-07-488_5791b1afe4943cea.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/qXVW8J2VAtk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn89@2020_6/2020/12/12/07-46-09-583_3256e0d821df3b95.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1607759120493},{"createdTime":"2020-12-12 15:45:20","updatedTime":"2020-12-12 15:45:20","title":"Movie Release Dates: ‘Free Guy’ Moves to May, ‘Death on the Nile’ Floats to September, ‘Antlers’ Vanishes Entirely","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=649790","description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/FotoJet-27-1.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-649796\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/FotoJet-27-1-700x394.jpg\" alt=\"Free Guy Release Date\" width=\"700\" height=\"394\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/FotoJet-27-1-700x394.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/FotoJet-27-1-360x203.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/FotoJet-27-1-768x432.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Yesterday, Disney held their huge, exhausting Investors Day presentation, and while they announced plenty of stuff, they didn&#8217;t cover <em>everything</em>. For instance: three upcoming Disney-adjacent films – <strong><em>Free Guy</em></strong>, with <strong>Ryan Reynolds</strong>, <strong>Kenneth Branagh</strong>&#8216;s <em><strong>Death on the Nile</strong></em>, and the horror film <strong><em>Antlers</em></strong> – received no mention. But now we have some updates. Both <em>Free Guy</em> and <em>Death on the Nile</em> have changed their release dates yet again, while <em>Antlers</em> has vanished from the calendar entirely.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-649790\"></span></p>\n<p>Sure, we got a ton of news about Marvel, Pixar, <em>Star Wars</em>, and other Disney-related stuff yesterday. But what of the lonely world of Fox? Disney owns Fox now (in case you forgot), which means they own upcoming movies <em>Free Guy</em>, <em>Death on the Nile</em>, and <em>Antlers</em>. But since those movies didn&#8217;t really fit in with the brand synergy the House of Mouse was selling yesterday, they went unremarked upon. Today, though, Disney shuffled their release dates.</p>\n<p>First: <em>Free Guy</em>. Directed by <strong>Shawn Levy</strong> and starring Ryan Reynolds, <em>Free Guy </em>follows a bank teller called Guy who &#8220;realizes he is a background character in an open world video game called Free City that will soon go offline.&#8221; The film was supposed to hit theaters on July 3, 2020, but of course, that didn&#8217;t happen due to the coronavirus. So Disney moved it to December 11, 2020 – and then pulled it from the release date calendar entirely. Now, it&#8217;s back, with a new date for 2021 – <strong>May 2, 2021</strong>, to be precise.</p>\n<p>Then there&#8217;s <em>Death on the Nile</em>. This is Kenneth Branagh&#8217;s follow-up to <em>Murder on the Orient Express</em>, and once again, Branagh is playing famed detective Hercule Poirot. In the first film, Poirot had to solve a crime on a moving train. Here, a murder happens on a boat. And, like the first film, Branagh is backed-up by a cast of famous faces: <strong>Russell Brand</strong>, <strong>Gal Gadot</strong>, <strong>Armie Hammer</strong>, <strong>Rose Leslie</strong>, <strong>Letitia Wright</strong>, and more. Believe it or not, once upon a time Disney planned on releasing this on December 20, 2019. Then they changed it to October 9, 2020. Then it got pushed two more times: first to October 23, and again to December 18. Then, just like <em>Free Guy</em>, it got pulled from the calendar entirely. There was some speculation that <em>Death on the Nile</em> might go to Disney+, but instead, Disney has now given it a <strong>September 7, 2021</strong> release date.</p>\n<p>Finally, there&#8217;s <em>Antlers</em>, the only title in this story I&#8217;m actually interested in seeing. So of course, it&#8217;s the one title that has no new release date at all. Directed by <strong>Scott Cooper</strong> and produced by <strong>Guillermo del Toro</strong>, this horror film involves a mysterious creature terrorizing a small town. It was supposed to open on April 17, 2020, then got pushed to February 19, 2021. Now, it&#8217;s off the calendar entirely. If I had to guess, I would wager that Disney might be considering releasing this one straight to Hulu. Both <em>Free Guy</em> and <em>Death on the Nile</em> are bigger movies with bigger stars, and Disney obviously wants to keep them theatrical. <em>Antlers</em>, however, is a smaller, R-rated horror film, so I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if it went to streaming. Or perhaps that&#8217;s just wishful thinking on my part, because I&#8217;d sure like to see this thing sooner rather than later.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/free-guy-release-date/\">Movie Release Dates: &#8216;Free Guy&#8217; Moves to May, &#8216;Death on the Nile&#8217; Floats to September, &#8216;Antlers&#8217; Vanishes Entirely</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=gR_m6KBNqKA:CISImfhzoBA:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=gR_m6KBNqKA:CISImfhzoBA:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=gR_m6KBNqKA:CISImfhzoBA:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=gR_m6KBNqKA:CISImfhzoBA:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=gR_m6KBNqKA:CISImfhzoBA:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=gR_m6KBNqKA:CISImfhzoBA:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/gR_m6KBNqKA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 11 Dec 2020 18:00:15 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/FotoJet-27-1-700x394.jpg","linkMd5":"11546186575a7c740c4c9bd182f46961","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn8@2020_1/2020/12/12/07-46-04-319_f450c1641d183889.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":394,"sourceBytes":56907,"destBytes":39066,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/FotoJet-27-1-700x394.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn8@2020_1/2020/12/12/07-46-04-319_f450c1641d183889.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn26@2020_5/2020/12/12/07-46-09-160_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=gR_m6KBNqKA:CISImfhzoBA:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn17@2020_3/2020/12/12/07-46-10-459_b0e2d41f32de3f29.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn21@2020_5/2020/12/12/07-46-11-127_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=gR_m6KBNqKA:CISImfhzoBA:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn48@2020_3/2020/12/12/07-46-08-429_15944c50c3983c77.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/gR_m6KBNqKA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn90@2020_4/2020/12/12/07-46-07-475_943968d7113acf37.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1607759120494},{"createdTime":"2020-12-12 15:45:20","updatedTime":"2020-12-12 15:45:20","title":"Pixar’s ‘Soul’ Clips: Joe Gardner Teaches Band Class and Zones Out While Tickling the Ivories","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=649071","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-647870 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/soul-joegardner-piano-inthezone-colorful-700x319.jpg\" alt=\"Soul Featurette\" width=\"700\" height=\"319\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/soul-joegardner-piano-inthezone-colorful-700x319.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/soul-joegardner-piano-inthezone-colorful-360x164.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/soul-joegardner-piano-inthezone-colorful-768x350.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/soul-joegardner-piano-inthezone-colorful.jpg 1192w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Christmas will bring us two cinematic gifts to keep us occupied during what will probably be the weirdest and saddest holiday season that we&#8217;ve had in awhile. <em>Wonder Woman 1984</em> will arrive on HBO Max the same day that it hits theaters, and Disney is releasing Pixar&#8217;s <strong><em>Soul</em></strong> on Disney+ at no extra charge. Since we&#8217;ve been seeing so much from the former recently, it&#8217;s time to get a new look at the latter with a new clip that shows off the incredible piano skills of Joe Gardner (<strong>Jamie Foxx</strong>).<span id=\"more-649071\"></span></p>\n<h2>Pixar&#8217;s Soul Clips</h2>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DRNPg-xPoZc?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>In this first clip, which opens the movie, we get to see how Joe Gardner tries to bring a little passion to his middle school band class. If you were ever in band in school, you know exactly what this classroom is like. But there&#8217;s always some glimmer of musical hope in a few students, and Joe sees that here, even if he&#8217;s not entirely satisfied with his job. Thankfully, there&#8217;s a new opportunity that comes his way.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/x19uk5g71zI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>Joe Gardner gets to tickle the ivories in an impressive way when he sits down to audition for <span class=\"aCOpRe\">legendary jazz musician Dorothea Williams (<strong>Angela Bassett</strong>) </span>and her quartet that&#8217;s playing at <span class=\"aCOpRe\">The Half Note Club in New York City. Dorothea laments the fact that they&#8217;re relegated to hearing a middle school band teacher audition to fill a spot in their group, but she changes her tune completely when Gardner plays a bit of improvised music on the piano, finally landing him the kind of gig he&#8217;s been yearning to get for years. </span></p>\n<p>This is one of those sequences that shows off how incredible the animation in <em>Soul</em> really is. Aside from bringing piano playing to life in a surreal visual representation, the dimly lit environment of the club perfectly captures the essence of a hole-in-the-wall jazz venue like that. The instruments themselves look like they were plucked from reality, from the shimmer on the saxophone to the veneer on the bass.
