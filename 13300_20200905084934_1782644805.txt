With the open road and a bag of snacks, the main task for the passenger is to not fall asleep in order to keep the driver focused and entertained. But sometimes the hum of the engine and the blurring green landscape lulls any good companion into one of the most uncomfortable naps ever had. Tapping into this idea is &#352;koda France for its latest campaign, which has captured these contorted positions in a series of OOH ads to promote a new package its created.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#160;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Working with Paris-based agency Rosapark, the car brand aims to combat this classic car journey trope by introducing its Sleep Package, a unique add-on for its vehicles, which consists of two adjustable headrests so that snoozing passengers can get some comfortable sleep.&#160;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The images have been shot by photographer Sophie Ebrard. &#8220;The brief was to create a campaign that would be as genuine and real as possible, and to make it funny,&#8221; says Ebrard. &#8220;The insight of this campaign is so strong, anyone can recognise themselves, or someone they know, I certainly can!&#8221;</span></p>\n<div class=\"media media-img alignnone\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-165175 size-full\" src=\"https://centaur-wp.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/creativereview/prod/content/uploads/2020/09/skoda-packsSommeil-RP-EN-2.jpg?auto=compress,format&#38;q=60&#38;w=1200&#38;h=1760\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1760\" data-img-id=\"165175\" srcset=\"https://centaur-wp.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/creativereview/prod/content/uploads/2020/09/skoda-packsSommeil-RP-EN-2.jpg?auto=compress,format&#38;q=60&#38;w=1200&#38;h= 1200w, https://centaur-wp.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/creativereview/prod/content/uploads/2020/09/skoda-packsSommeil-RP-EN-2.jpg?auto=compress,format&#38;q=60&#38;w=206&#38;h=302 206w, https://centaur-wp.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/creativereview/prod/content/uploads/2020/09/skoda-packsSommeil-RP-EN-2.jpg?auto=compress,format&#38;q=60&#38;w=341&#38;h=500 341w, https://centaur-wp.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/creativereview/prod/content/uploads/2020/09/skoda-packsSommeil-RP-EN-2.jpg?auto=compress,format&#38;q=60&#38;w=768&#38;h=1126 768w, https://centaur-wp.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/creativereview/prod/content/uploads/2020/09/skoda-packsSommeil-RP-EN-2.jpg?auto=compress,format&#38;q=60&#38;w=1047&#38;h=1536 1047w, https://centaur-wp.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/creativereview/prod/content/uploads/2020/09/skoda-packsSommeil-RP-EN-2.jpg?auto=compress,format&#38;q=60&#38;w=736&#38;h=1080 736w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;I think this kind of advertising only works if you really believe that the person is really asleep,&#8221; Ebrard continues. &#8220;When you can sense that it&#8217;s made for advertising, that&#8217;s when you lose your audience.&#8221; To capture that authenticity, the creative referenced pictures of herself asleep, with her mouth open, that her partner had taken over the years. &#8220;I was a very strong candidate for the casting!&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alongside this, a <a href=\"https://www.hughtodd.com/#/schwane/\">classic campaign by the photographer Frank Budgen</a> for luxury lingerie and erotic shop Coco de Mer, where subjects were caught supposedly mid-orgasm, also proved inspiring. &#8220;How you fake someone mid-orgasm is to me as hard as faking someone who is asleep. That&#8217;s a real fine line. It can look instantly fake as an image,&#8221; explains Ebrard. &#8220;Frank Budgen&#8217;s images look real. That&#8217;s what I was looking for.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The campaign was shot at the beginning of July when Covid-19 restrictions and regulations lifted enough to allow creative working environments more flexibility. &#8220;Of course, we all wore masks and disinfected areas, and our hands multiple times a day,&#8221; says the photographer. &#8220;And we wanted to create a safe environment for them to feel comfortable and at ease so they could pretend to be asleep.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;I like to create a fun environment for people,&#8221; she adds. &#8220;There needs to be a chemistry between the talent and myself when I shoot.
