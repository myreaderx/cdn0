A new calling interface will now show contacts, voicemail, and calling history in a single location. It’s designed to allow Microsoft Teams to more easily replace your desk phone, with built-in spam call protection, reverse number lookup, and the ability to merge calls. </p>\n<p id=\"ZyMqEd\">Microsoft Teams users will also be able to transfer calls between mobile and desktop soon, allowing people to quickly move locations in the middle of an audio or video call. The Teams app will let people join without audio on an additional device, or simply transfer the call and end it automatically on other devices. Microsoft says this particular feature will be available in early 2021.</p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n     ...</figure>\n  <p>\n    <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21754862/microsoft-teams-calling-update-carplay-onedrive-recording-features\">Continue reading&hellip;</a>\n  </p>\n\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WinRumors/~4/PdgeE7E4cnw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 01 Dec 2020 17:00:00 +0000","feedId":5203,"bgimg":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K2TUFgb6SUp_h-igzbSg3RJHMb8=/63x0:738x450/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68058693/microsoftteamscalling.0.gif","linkMd5":"d7eac660757123d5d9a6698d3f4e216d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn58@2020_1/2020/12/03/14-10-25-023_88676ddfb8c4aac9.webp","destWidth":1310,"destHeight":873,"sourceBytes":81349422,"destBytes":1963920,"author":"Tom Warren","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K2TUFgb6SUp_h-igzbSg3RJHMb8=/63x0:738x450/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68058693/microsoftteamscalling.0.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn65@2020_6/2020/12/03/14-10-14-074_88676ddfb8c4aac9.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WinRumors/~4/PdgeE7E4cnw":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn62@2020_1/2020/12/03/14-09-57-370_1bdf08469efc896e.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1607004476629}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-12-03 22:07:56","updatedTime":"2020-12-03 22:07:56","feedId":5203,"fetchDate":"Thu, 03 Dec 2020 14:07:56 +0000","fetchMs":28,"handleMs":48,"totalMs":150610,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":10,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"05b50c64cd16569d0e135aedb1e28ee2","hostName":"us-003*","requestId":"edd7f46eb67f4cada96e40a71042090e_5203","contentType":"text/xml;
