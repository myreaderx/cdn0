But with growing public awareness of climate change came the recognition that its impacts are disproportionately experienced by Black, Indigenous, and other communities of color. </p>\n<p id=\"OaLdC3\">The problem, according to many Black climate advocates, is that awareness is not enough.</p>\n<p id=\"6WcnkV\"><a href=\"https://www.tolesolaughlin.com/\">Tamara Toles O’Laughlin</a> is one of the best-known advocates for what she calls the “Black climate agenda”: a movement that seeks to correct the failures of the climate movement to include Black people and that wants to see racial justice at the center of climate policy conversations. </p>\n<p id=\"XVzmEn\">A lifelong environmental activist, Toles O’Laughlin is the former director of the North American region of <a href=\"https://350.org/category/location/north-america/\">350.org</a>,<strong> </strong>an international environmental organization founded in 2007 that uses a grassroots approach to build support for ending fossil fuels.</p>\n<p id=\"aoNsGo\">The Black climate agenda is about more than just representation. It’s about equity and righting the wrongs that have been done in the past to make a just future possible. In her vision, the agenda should include policies like <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1539726\">climate reparations</a> that address the disproportionate impact climate change has had on Black communities, as well as Indigenous people and other communities of color. </p>\n<p id=\"gr7L0C\">There are some initial signs that the righting of wrongs is already starting to happen, at least in the US. </p>\n<p id=\"kILS7n\">Through the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/22231808/joe-biden-economic-stimulus-proposal\">American Rescue Plan</a>, the Biden-Harris administration allocated <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/03/08/reparations-black-farmers-stimulus/\">$5 billion to help Black farmers</a> who have long suffered from racially discriminatory agricultural policies. Biden’s<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/03/31/fact-sheet-the-american-jobs-plan/\"> American Jobs Plan</a>, meanwhile, aims to address “longstanding and persistent racial injustice,” including<strong> </strong>by allocating 40 percent of the benefits from investments in climate and clean energy infrastructure to “disadvantaged communities.”</p>\n<p id=\"hSZIJL\">But while many Black climate advocates agree that these sorts of measures are a big step in the right direction, they are also historically conscious of the need to keep up the pressure.</p>\n<p id=\"kh8DiR\">“I’m excited about implementation and deployment and about taking steps to make sure that all this fantastic language becomes fantastic programming, incredible regulation, enforcement, accountability, and transparency [from] the Biden-Harris administration as it ages,” Toles O’Laughlin told me. </p>\n<p id=\"yr0vGQ\">I called Toles O’Laughlin to find about more about the Black climate agenda, what its goals are, and how it plans to go about achieving them.</p>\n<p id=\"tTxX93\">Our discussion, edited for length and clarity, is below.</p>\n<hr class=\"p-entry-hr\" id=\"dQ4nkT\">\n<h4 id=\"C2r0z2\">Jariel Arvin</h4>\n<p id=\"jzkSZf\">What exactly is the Black climate agenda? </p>\n<h4 id=\"8xjoN0\">Tamara Toles O’Laughlin</h4>\n<p id=\"9pJ2nj\">Like all movements, the Black climate agenda isn’t just one thing. I’m not the only person working on it, nor am I the only person who will help to perfect it. The Black climate agenda is everything that we must do at this moment to make sure that there are Black people in the future and that we’re not just surviving, we are thriving. </p>\n<p id=\"8RsCpx\">The individual elements are coming together and lots of communities are coming to the same conclusion: The world of climate and environment has not included the lives, expertise, or experiences of Black people. And given that that is the case, it is up to us to work to support our lives, our sanctity, and the safety and future of the next generation. </p>\n<p id=\"mprWZA\">We are more likely to become refugees when the impacts of climate change become too much to bear, given that the system has failed to serve us. If we do not carve out a Black climate agenda, there’s no reason to believe anybody else will.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Za9WOP\">Jariel Arvin</h4>\n<p id=\"2p8OeR\">Wow. That’s tough.</p>\n<h4 id=\"b7KGJ2\">Tamara Toles O’Laughlin</h4>\n<p id=\"FT3k5f\">It’s tough because it can sound like we’re erasing the efforts of Black, Indigenous, and other people of color to work together. But Black people have always been the litmus test for change in this country. Black people are always left in the margins by systems of policy working together to diminish us, leaving us chronically underserved from generation to generation — even in our <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/women/reports/2019/05/02/469186/eliminating-racial-disparities-maternal-infant-mortality/\">mother’s wombs</a>. </p>\n<p id=\"LQZUWx\">So, when the hate is that deep, we have to come up with our schedule and agenda for survival.</p>\n<div class=\"c-float-right\"><aside id=\"8ATLeM\"><q>“When the hate is that deep, we have to come up with our schedule and agenda for survival”</q></aside></div>\n<h4 id=\"BXub3J\">Jariel Arvin</h4>\n<p id=\"Hk2aIE\">When you say “we,” who exactly do you mean?</p>\n<h4 id=\"0KYBHl\">Tamara Toles O’Laughlin</h4>\n<p id=\"6NM9Nl\">I mean <a href=\"https://environment.yale.edu/profile/taylor\">Dorceta Taylor</a>, <a href=\"https://drrobertbullard.com/\">Bob Bullard</a>, <a href=\"https://www.weact.org/person/peggy-shepard/\">Peggy Shepard</a>. <a href=\"https://thenejc.org/vernice-miller-travis/\">Vernice Miller Travis</a>, Michel Gelobter, <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1516588&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fin%2Fprofmkd%2F&amp;referrer=vox.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vox.com%2F22358730%2Fclimate-change-biden-environmental-racial-justice\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Michael Dorsey</a> — these are the kinds of people who make those who know them nervous, because they have never been anything other than unapologetically Black, whether they worked at the Ford Foundation or they worked outside the doors demanding change in philanthropy or they wrote the stories of people who were fighting for change and just to not be poisoned. </p>\n<p id=\"oK4sfY\">One of my favorite friends, leaders, and colleagues on this is <a href=\"https://ccrjustice.org/home/who-we-are/board/battle-colette-pichon\">Colette Pichon Battle</a> — partly because she’s talking about Louisiana and the Gulf South, which is rapidly losing land as fast as we can count it. The movement in the South includes Chandra Farley, who’s working on energy justice in the South at the <a href=\"https://psequity.org/about/\">Partnership for Southern Equity</a>, and <a href=\"http://wesolar.energy/about/\">Kristal Hansley</a>, who’s lifting the business itself by having started the first Black solar company in Baltimore City in the 2000s. </p>\n<p id=\"MCf1GT\">We are all people who have come to this conclusion, surfacing at the same time. We just haven’t been spoken to as though we are the strategists and architects that we are. We might be asked to move into the camera — we are asked to explain our pain because it’s entertaining to people — but conversations around strategy are too often had without us. And then that absence shows up in politics. It shows up in the policy. And it shows up as a failing— which leads us to have lost all this time in the climate crisis.</p>\n<h4 id=\"ukKM6N\">Jariel Arvin</h4>\n<p id=\"xc1iGq\">So given all the past failures, how’s the Biden administration doing on fulfilling the Black climate agenda?</p>\n<h4 id=\"44aOvl\">Tamara Toles O’Laughlin</h4>\n<p id=\"Gezdws\">The Biden administration has a better listening ear than any other presidential administration to date. Not just because the last one sucked — which would be very easy to say — but because in the entire history of American presidents, we have always had<strong> </strong>[slavery and its legacy], the birth problem of the American experiment, the suppression of women and children, and Black bodies, intellectual power, and capacity. But<strong> </strong>we’ve never had a president who admitted that the system was in on it. </p>\n<p id=\"eJIVxY\">The $2 trillion infrastructure plan —  what Biden thinks it will take to rebuild America, includes a clear admission that Black people have been restricted by racially restrictive covenants, which in places including Baltimore lasted until 1985. </p>\n<p id=\"k9cLNf\">So when we start to talk about intergenerational wealth and a transfer of power, it isn’t just about the failure of the GI Bill to fully reach Black and brown people, or every single law that’s ever been passed having exclusions to keep us Black people oppressed, but the idea that we could not own a home where we want legally in this land that we built until this generation presents a multigenerational problem that has to be reckoned with. </p>\n<p id=\"L9aOud\">And so, while there are many things to be said about whether the Biden-Harris administration will meet all of our goals, needs, and desires without us advocating for them, I do think some admissions are coming from the executive branch that have never come before, which is that we are not just “historically disadvantaged” — we have been harmed, excised, and intentionally not supported at every level. </p>\n<p id=\"Vi61n0\">One of the most striking early pieces of the American Jobs Plan that I saw that I was excited about was the truth that racial injustice and discrimination equals less innovation because it suppresses potential. What president has ever said that? </p>\n<h4 id=\"iv78fM\">Jariel Arvin</h4>\n<p id=\"VlQoT0\">Could Obama have said that? I’ve been wondering how much of the Biden-Harris administration’s success on climate can be attributed to their policies and the people that have pushed Biden to adopt this progressive climate agenda versus it just being a natural progression of where we have to be at this point as a society. It’s 2021 right? We can’t continue to pretend like this stuff doesn’t exist.</p>\n<h4 id=\"DfMLGq\">Tamara Toles O’Laughlin</h4>\n<p id=\"Pfg9Xz\">I can’t speak to what it’s like to be Barack Obama, but I can speak as someone who’s been first, only, and different my entire life trying to do this work. Up to even my last role where I was the first African American in the history of this work to lead a white-lead climate organization, I can tell you that it takes a certain amount of life force to have the momentum to break through a glass ceiling, which makes it pretty difficult to move in the other direction, to go back and clean up the glass.</p>\n<p id=\"OMxylM\">I think having to choose which battles you want to fight is a problem of false scarcity, and Obama was as much victim to that as any other Black person who’s ever stood up to lead anything and been the first. </p>\n<h4 id=\"rH0LrQ\">Jariel Arvin</h4>\n<p id=\"Zw8uQG\">According to Biden’s Jobs Plan, 40 percent of federal investments are going to go to communities of color. What does that look like? How does the money trickle down — I hate to use that word, but how does the money get to where it needs to go?</p>\n<h4 id=\"FQMXb5\">Tamara Toles O’Laughlin</h4>\n<p id=\"zXsiiB\">I wish he had used the words that you used. As candidate Biden became President Biden, somehow that language around the 40 percent to Environmental Justice became 40 percent of the <em>benefits </em>of clean energy investments. And what gets lost when we turn the phrase into “benefits”? A benefit could be that it’s sunny outside. It’s too ambiguous a term. And it may need to be legally defined.</p>\n<h4 id=\"QZvtnL\">Jariel Arvin</h4>\n<p id=\"MjWtMw\">Wait — so it’s now the benefits, not the total investment?</p>\n<h4 id=\"2XFYhO\">Tamara Toles O’Laughlin</h4>\n<p id=\"QKSM4Q\">And this is a strategically different word, which means we’re going to have to litigate. We’re going to have to push for policy. <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/2019/5/20/18542843/intersectionality-conservatism-law-race-gender-discrimination\">Kimberlé Crenshaw’s intersectionality</a> teaches us that there are multiple forms of harm happening at any given point to a person or in a place — so “disadvantaged communities”? Disadvantaged by whom? And relative to what? </p>\n<p id=\"ySrqVF\">If it’s coming out of the Environmental Protection Agency, we’ll have to hold Administrator Michael Regan accountable. If we are talking about the Council for Environmental Quality, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/biden-transition-updates/2020/12/17/947355441/biden-to-nominate-brenda-mallory-to-run-council-on-environmental-quality\">Brenda Mallory</a> is the person who’s ultimately responsible for that.</p>\n<p id=\"XWwDin\">I think the intentions are good. I am excited about the winds of change. But for them to blow into my community, we’re gonna have to get specific because the benefits of investments are not the same as investments.</p>\n<h4 id=\"aYSAEn\">Jariel Arvin</h4>\n<p id=\"FMlywq\">Do you think that there’s any potential to see climate reparations for Black folks?</p>\n<h4 id=\"8682ZQ\">Tamara Toles O’Laughlin</h4>\n<p id=\"LQIaAP\">Climate reparations are the future, because there’s no chance that we can get all the people who need to be supported the help they need to survive climate change if we don’t figure out how to move money and people and opportunities in the direction of people who have been harmed. So, given that we have a president and a Cabinet that’s for accountability, one measure of their success is how quickly we can move loss and damage into a global framework and climate reparations into a domestic framework.</p>\n<p id=\"V7TNjh\">We won’t live to experience all of it, even if we live 100 years. The problems will go on, and so the reinvestment will have to happen over generations. And only a climate reparations regime as a part of a Black climate agenda can ensure that that happens because the work of reparations has always been the work of care and repair, and the work of climate reparations is the work of care and repair for people and planet.</p>\n<h4 id=\"N6Eqwe\">Jariel Arvin</h4>\n<p id=\"yeHLrG\">Is there enough awareness among the everyday Black population about the Black climate agenda? If not, how do you think the movement can be spread to everyday Black people who are feeling climate impacts — like how long summers last and how hot they’re getting — but who are not yet plugged into the strategy that you’re talking about?</p>\n<h4 id=\"aroNyn\">Tamara Toles O’Laughlin</h4>\n<p id=\"jFXhBN\">I do think that our communities are aware of it in the same way that fishermen and folks who spend time on the water are aware of it — we see that the things we count on to tell us that time is passing are changing. We live in urban environments, which have the <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/heatislands#:~:text=Heat%20islands%20are%20urbanized%20areas,as%20forests%20and%20water%20bodies.\">urban heat island effect</a>, which can make some places feels like August from May to December. </p>\n<p id=\"lgLLdG\">These are things that we can not only tell, but we also feel in our bodies. We have asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and all too often heart attacks at higher rates due to proximity to fossil fuel generation and pollution.</p>\n<p id=\"kecO0J\">I think what we fail to do is use our concepts, understanding, and language when we talk to our communities. It’s why one of the ways I describe myself is as a “jargon destroyer.” Because I think the key to helping folks to see themselves in the vision of the future and to put some furniture in it is to get them to be really clear that this is happening to them and that they are also part of the solution.</p>\n<p id=\"tIRgd8\">Some of it is about who the messengers are. If LeBron James decides he cares about something, a whole lot of other people do too. Regina Hall has had a project on Wednesdays, called Woman Crush Wednesday, through <a href=\"https://thesolutionsproject.org/?gclid=CjwKCAjw6qqDBhB-EiwACBs6x27dHAS0cbf2kTGz1NMvx8cdS1Tvx0wN4PZpAW2xQzLeKwULbzSmUBoCoiEQAvD_BwE\">the Solutions Project</a>, where she has highlighted a Black woman activist every Wednesday for the last few years. We need more of that. </p>\n<p id=\"u4hOyM\"><a href=\"https://uprootproject.org/\">The Uproot Project</a> — which is this project for journalists of color who cover the environment — gives me a lot of hope because I feel like we could start to tell these stories in our language, which will invite more people into caring about it.</p>\n<p id=\"6CxV1T\">I’ll tell you, as we are on the precipice of Earth Day, my awakening wasn’t just being given an opportunity to do this work, but recognizing that there was an entry point that didn’t mean I had to become someone else. Even if I couldn’t find people like me in the early Earth Day celebrations, it was exciting to me to know that other people cared about what I cared about.</p>\n<h4 id=\"rnCZR7\">Jariel Arvin</h4>\n<p id=\"3O8aiJ\">That has me thinking about not only Black people in America but also Black people worldwide. Do you think there’s potential for a global movement around the Black climate agenda that includes Black people in the Caribbean, in Africa, in Europe, and elsewhere?</p>\n<h4 id=\"9N230U\">Tamara Toles O’Laughlin</h4>\n<p id=\"36nc6B\">You can’t see it, but I’m smiling from ear to ear. I have said it everywhere that there is no national climate policy — it is all a global one, because we messed up so badly that there’s no chance any one of us can fix it. </p>\n<p id=\"ZiIuQz\">But also because Black people have been the stewards of the earth everywhere we’ve ever been. What is it Jay-Z says, “Put me anywhere on God’s green earth I’ll triple my worth,” right? </p>\n<p id=\"y2b87g\">One of my favorite people to talk to on Twitter is <a href=\"https://www.queenscommonwealthtrust.org/inspiration/oladosu-adenike-i-lead-climate-nigeria-lake-chad/\">Oladosu Adenike</a>, an ecofeminist for Lake Chad. There are also folks in the Pacific, there are activists across Africa like Rukiya Khamis fighting coal and in Asia and the Philippines and Tokyo and Hong Kong who have been doing this work with folks with very little power.</p>\n<p id=\"CbfrT5\">In every part of the world where there are Black people, there are stories about our stewardship. And I think that those will either become stories of climate survival or of us becoming climate refugees. If we’re not telling the story of Haiti, of Africa and the Caribbean diaspora, and the African diaspora writ large, we are failing to tell the story. So it is incredibly important to me that a Black climate agenda includes a global perspective.</p>\n<h4 id=\"T1zhVq\">Jariel Arvin</h4>\n<p id=\"AELQlu\">Final thoughts?</p>\n<h4 id=\"lAb4bW\">Tamara Toles O’Laughlin</h4>\n<p id=\"kgqO8Z\">There are no scenarios where we win on the climate where we don’t deal with issues of racial injustice or environmental racism. And that starts with harm to Black and brown people, and it ends with the end of harm to Black people.</p>\n<p id=\"lQvh5l\">The strategy of movements and the <em>movement</em> of movements is really about recognizing that there isn’t just one person who’s doing it — we are all part of an elaborate network holding up the arch to justice. It’s heavy, and we need each other. </p>\n<p id=\"F1Bs24\">That’s the gorgeous thing about this movement. It’s the reason why we can have a Black climate agenda and I don’t have to care at all about what my white friends feel about it because they know that it’s true too.</p>\n\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 07 Apr 2021 17:00:00 +0000","feedId":99,"bgimg":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6uwiiXAv0r63a3LZOJoB7OqFRQs=/556x0:5000x3333/1310x983/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69089954/GettyImages_1228693906.0.jpg","linkMd5":"41d1c5c0a2f1181ad1fd1b0549789285","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn31@2020_1/2021/04/07/17-38-33-427_15a70a421d980e5c.webp","destWidth":1310,"destHeight":983,"sourceBytes":291681,"destBytes":244886,"author":"Jariel Arvin","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6uwiiXAv0r63a3LZOJoB7OqFRQs=/556x0:5000x3333/1310x983/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69089954/GettyImages_1228693906.0.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn31@2020_1/2021/04/07/17-38-33-427_15a70a421d980e5c.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617817113023},{"createdTime":"2021-04-08 01:38:33","updatedTime":"2021-04-08 01:38:33","title":"Why China is still clinging to coal","link":"https://www.vox.com/2021/4/6/22369284/china-coal-power-economy-climate-change","description":"  \n\n    <figure>\n      <img alt=\"Shanxi Coal Mine\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/J-H3MSw0FPe84RJ0WuelsJRUvkM=/286x0:4839x3415/1310x983/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69085343/1153721514.0.jpg\" />\n        <figcaption>A man shovels coal at a mine in Shanxi, China, in 2016.

That means instead of transitioning away from coal power — the source of nearly <a href=\"https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/YrfqTisN9zAIYxnbyXzExw\">40 percent</a> of China’s carbon emissions — it is doubling down. </p>\n<p id=\"PKvhf1\">And due in large part to China, global coal power capacity under development increased for the first time since 2015.</p>\n<p id=\"DzRyO1\">At the same time, the EU and US are retiring coal plants rapidly as renewables, natural gas, and climate regulations make them less competitive, but they still need to speed up retirements in the coming years.<strong> </strong>According to a <a href=\"https://globalenergymonitor.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/CoalPathway.pdf\">2018 report</a><strong> </strong>by Greenpeace and the Global Energy Monitor, OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development)  member countries have to phase out coal completely by 2030 to stay in line with the Paris climate agreement goal to keep temperatures from rising more than 1.5 degrees Celsius. The US and the EU — the world’s largest historical emitters — are not on track to retire their coal plants by that deadline.</p>\n<p id=\"SCtNej\">“I hope people realize, it’s sad to say, but just how far off we are from where we need to be for the Paris climate agreement,” said Christine Shearer, program director at Global Energy Monitor and co-author of the new coal report. </p>\n<p id=\"gn2qlz\">China has pledged to go carbon-neutral by 2060, but its new coal spree is the latest sign that it is <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/22313871/china-energy-climate-change-five-year-plan-wind-solar-coal-oil-gas\">putting off</a> the immediate actions needed to meet that long-term goal. </p>\n<p id=\"QQSEHb\">Understanding why China is still clinging to coal is critically important, because the country’s energy decisions over the next few years will play a decisive role in whether the world can meet global climate targets. </p>\n<h3 id=\"wacN0E\">What’s driving China’s latest coal boom</h3>\n<p id=\"AogWu6\">Over the past decade, China has been the primary driving force behind coal plant construction in the world. And in the last five years, that divide has grown. As the chart below shows, coal plant proposals have fallen rapidly in the rest of the world while climbing again in China since 2018. </p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oL_dI4WczK7OYQDfzG6ZY13c1aA=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22423686/Screen_Shot_2021_04_05_at_9.59.31_PM.png\">\n      <cite><a class=\"ql-link\" href=\"https://globalenergymonitor.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/BoomAndBust_2021_final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Global Energy Monitor</a></cite>\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"WYIYdV\">In 2020, China added 38 gigawatts of coal-fired power — 76 percent of the global total — to its grid<strong> </strong>even as President Xi Jinping was calling for a global green recovery from the pandemic-caused economic recession. </p>\n<p id=\"pdvst6\">Shearer said this construction was on par with previous years, adding, “It is surprising though, because for most countries there was a notable slowdown in 2020 due to Covid.”</p>\n<p id=\"6NNubQ\">So why are we seeing such a big divergence between Xi’s growing climate rhetoric and construction on the ground?</p>\n<p id=\"NrhUgh\">The backstory is that China’s provinces were given the authority to approve new power plants in <a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-will-china-build-hundreds-of-new-coal-plants-in-the-2020s\">2014</a>, leading to a huge surge in projects. For poorer, coal-rich provinces, building a new power plant is a way to boost GDP. With the economic crunch from the pandemic, local governments launched a wave of new projects last spring, according to Lauri Myllyvirta, lead analyst at the Center for Research on Energy and Clean Air, a global research organization. </p>\n<p id=\"pvmTtr\">China’s short-term climate target is just to peak its emissions, bringing them down before 2030; some government officials have taken that as a mandate to reduce emissions now, while “others see that as a window to build more fossil capacity while there is still space for emissions to grow,” said Myllyvirta. </p>\n<p id=\"DqVidC\">However, local governments don’t have full autonomy over these decisions. The central government has maintained some control over coal plant approvals using a traffic light system, through which the National Energy Administration can place provinces under a red light, barring further coal plant development if they already have enough power capacity.  In recent years, due to concerns about energy security as electricity demand continues to rise, the traffic light system has grown <a href=\"https://chinadialogue.net/en/energy/11966-china-relaxes-restrictions-on-coal-power-expansion-for-third-year-running/\">very lax</a>, though. </p>\n<p id=\"RVrW1H\">To meet global climate targets, that system needs to change. “The concern is local government,” Fuqiang Yang, a senior adviser at Peking University’s Climate Change and Energy Transition Program, told Vox. “Now is the time for the central government to get back these approval rights.”</p>\n<p id=\"JO5EXF\">The central government has sent signals that it is cracking down on provinces pursuing new coal plants. China’s powerful Central Environmental Inspection Team<strong> </strong>made an unprecedented move in February, issuing <a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/qa-could-an-environmental-inspectors-criticisms-accelerate-chinas-climate-policies\">a report</a> condemning the National Energy Administration (NEA) for not prioritizing environmental protection in energy planning and allowing for unnecessary power plant development. But so far, the NEA hasn’t issued a public response outlining how it plans to change. </p>\n<p id=\"uXDGuo\">Meanwhile, another big test of the top authorities' commitment to reining in coal is approaching. China released its 14th general five-year plan in March, and in the coming months, it is expected to release sector-specific plans including one for electricity development. The China Electricity Council has proposed a coal power capacity target allowing coal capacity to rise from 1,080 gigawatts in 2020 to 1,250 by 2025. </p>\n<p id=\"36PclW\">But that is not compatible with the Paris agreement. According to Yang, China will have to further limit coal capacity to <a href=\"https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/YrfqTisN9zAIYxnbyXzExw\">1,150 gigawatts</a> to peak its emissions early, by 2025 (that peaking date is in line with the Paris 1.5°C target, according to the <a href=\"https://asiasociety.org/policy-institute/us-and-china-climate-goals-scenarios-2030-and-mid-century\">Asia Society Policy Institute</a>). Greenpeace East Asia is <a href=\"https://www.greenpeace.org.cn/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/%E3%80%90%E6%96%B0%E9%97%BB%E7%AE%80%E6%8A%A5%E3%80%91%E6%9E%84%E5%BB%BA%E4%BD%8E%E7%A2%B3%E6%96%B0%E5%9E%8B%E7%94%B5%E5%8A%9B%E7%B3%BB%E7%BB%9F%EF%BC%9A2020%E5%B9%B4%E7%85%A4%E7%94%B5%E6%A0%B8%E5%87%86%E7%83%AD%E6%BD%AE%E4%B8%8D%E5%8F%AF%E5%9C%A8%E2%80%9C%E5%8D%81%E5%9B%9B%E4%BA%94%E2%80%9D%E6%9C%9F%E9%97%B4%E9%87%8D%E6%BC%94.pdf\">lobbying for</a> an even stricter 2025 target: 1,100 gigawatts. </p>\n<p id=\"iH0xZg\">Because China’s coal plants are being utilized <a href=\"https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/YrfqTisN9zAIYxnbyXzExw\">far below</a> their full capacity, climate advocates argue that further development isn’t necessary. But currently, China has 247 gigawatts of coal power under some stage of development, so meeting those stricter targets will be an uphill battle. </p>\n<p id=\"iBZ5ZF\">Building all that capacity could also create bigger hurdles down the line. According to Global Energy Monitor and Greenpeace’s 1.5°C coal phase-out pathway, China will need to start shutting down power plants by 2025, retiring 23 gigawatts annually through the decade. (And that report was written in 2018, before these latest coal power additions, so retirements will have to be even higher now.)</p>\n<h3 id=\"MHU1de\">The rest of the world is turning away from coal, but not quickly enough</h3>\n<p id=\"cPPUTn\">Outside of China, 2020 brought some signs of hope from regions rapidly moving away from coal and retiring existing plants,<strong> </strong>the new report found. </p>\n<p id=\"UKLCBM\">As the dotted line in the chart below shows, if you filter out China, coal retirements have been outpacing commissioning since 2018. (Commissioning refers to a plant that is built and ready for operation). </p>\n<p id=\"8TXvDt\">One big reason for that: a slowdown in coal development in India and Southeast Asia. “South-Southeast Asia was long regarded as the next hotspot of coal power after China, and instead what we are seeing is government after government there make announcements that they’re going to cut back the amount of coal plants they have planned,” said Shearer. The falling cost of renewable energy has made coal less attractive, and the drop in electricity demand due to the pandemic has given many countries an opportunity to reassess their energy plans, she said. </p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Guv7_OvvN5FpB9OuWxqp8RF14Qw=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22423694/Screen_Shot_2021_04_05_at_10.03.21_PM.png\">\n      <cite><a class=\"ql-link\" href=\"https://globalenergymonitor.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/BoomAndBust_2021_final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Global Energy Monitor</a></cite>\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"YJalPZ\">On the retirement side, the EU and the US are driving the trend, tying a record for global coal retirements last year.

After Major League Baseball announced that it would <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2021/4/3/22365408/mlb-all-star-game-atlanta-explained-voter-suppression-bills\">move its 2021 All-Star Game from Atlanta</a> because the state of Georgia <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/22368044/georgia-sb202-voter-suppression-democracy-big-lie\">enacted a law limiting voting access</a>, several Republican lawmakers threatened to retaliate against the league by stripping it of an exemption from federal antitrust laws.</p>\n<div id=\"2c3uSR\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Why does <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MLB?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@MLB</a> still have antitrust immunity? It’s time for the federal government to stop granting special privileges to specific, favored corporations—especially those that punish their political opponents. <a href=\"https://t.co/k3GIZuGYHB\">https://t.co/k3GIZuGYHB</a></p>— Mike Lee (@SenMikeLee) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SenMikeLee/status/1378116038890377220?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 2, 2021</a>\n</blockquote>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n</div>\n<p id=\"JV8yGk\">Similarly, after Delta Air Lines spoke out against the same anti-voting law, Georgia’s GOP-controlled House voted to <a href=\"https://www.flyertalk.com/articles/georgia-lawmakers-symbolically-try-to-pull-deltas-jet-fuel-tax-break.html\">strip away a sales tax exemption for jet fuel that primarily benefits Delta</a>. (The bill did not pass the state Senate).</p>\n<p id=\"bQTLLk\">It’s not hard to understand the politics of these threats. Both MLB and Delta enjoy special exemptions from the law that aren’t enjoyed by many other companies or by individual Americans. So it’s not hard for these lawmakers to gin up resentment against them for receiving such privileged treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"h7Ea3i\">But using the power to make laws to punish critics of a particular policy, especially if that policy is itself designed to restrict voting, is inconsistent with democratic values. And so the Constitution forbids this sort of behavior by lawmakers. It is unconstitutional for the government to retaliate against anyone for expressing a political view that members of the government do not share. </p>\n<div class=\"c-float-right\"><div id=\"XiiVK7\"><div data-anthem-component=\"aside:10296380\"></div></div></div>\n<p id=\"McrXIH\">The Constitution permits Congress to impose antitrust regulation on a baseball league (although there are actually <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/22348385/supreme-court-ncaa-alston-football-basketball-march-madness-college-sports-antitrust\">good policy reasons</a> why sports leagues should enjoy some immunity from ordinary antitrust law). And the Constitution also permits Georgia to tax airlines. </p>\n<p id=\"Avf9Ew\">Yet, as the Supreme Court explained in <a href=\"https://casetext.com/case/perry-v-sindermann-8212-36\"><em>Perry v. Sindermann</em></a> (1972), “even though a person has no ‘right’ to a valuable governmental benefit and even though the government may deny him the benefit for any number of reasons, there are some reasons upon which the government may not rely.” Among other things, the government “may not deny a benefit to a person on a basis that infringes his constitutionally protected interests — especially, his interest in freedom of speech.”</p>\n<p id=\"6WLkB6\">It appears flatly unconstitutional, in other words, to strip a company of a “valuable governmental benefit” simply because lawmakers wish to silence that company.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Y5ol9r\">The government cannot require anyone to give up their free speech rights in order to receive a benefit</h3>\n<p id=\"z4Cu8t\">The constitutional rule against stripping someone of a government benefit to control their speech stretches back many decades.</p>\n<p id=\"6gIM1W\">California law gave a property tax exemption to honorably discharged World War II veterans. Yet, in 1954, it revised the form that veterans use to claim this exemption to require those veterans to swear a loyalty oath: “I do not advocate the overthrow of the Government of the United States or of the State of California by force or violence or other unlawful means, nor advocate the support of a foreign government against the United States in event of hostilities.”</p>\n<p id=\"S1DQgX\">After some veterans refused to swear this oath, their refusal wound up in the Supreme Court, and the Court ruled in <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2712741382307950463&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr\"><em>Speiser v. Randall</em></a> (1958) that these taxpayers “could not be required to execute the declaration as a condition for obtaining a tax exemption or as a condition for the assessor proceeding further in determining whether they were entitled to such an exemption.”</p>\n<p id=\"kOOSvL\"><em>Speiser</em> was a fairly early articulation of what is known as the “Unconstitutional Conditions Doctrine.” Both Congress and the states provide many benefits to individual citizens that are not required by the Constitution — California is not required to give tax breaks to veterans. But once a benefit is offered, the government may not strip someone of that benefit because they exercise their First Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"BF8Zis\">This notion that government benefits may not be conditioned on either compelled silence or compelled speech has endured, even as the Supreme Court has grown more conservative. In <a href=\"https://casetext.com/case/agency-for-intl-dev-v-alliance-for-open-socy-intl-inc-2\"><em>United States Agency for International Development v. Alliance for Open Society International, Inc.</em></a> (2013), for example, the Court struck down a requirement that organizations that receive certain federal grants intended to fight the global HIV epidemic must “have a policy explicitly opposing prostitution and sex trafficking.”</p>\n<p id=\"X2ckUM\">The <em>Open Society International</em> case drew a somewhat subtle line. As Chief Justice John Roberts explained in his majority opinion, “Congress can, without offending the Constitution, selectively fund certain programs to address an issue of public concern, without funding alternative ways of addressing the same problem.” So Congress was allowed to prohibit groups that receive federal anti-HIV grants from using those funds to “promote or advocate the legalization or practice of prostitution or sex trafficking.”</p>\n<p id=\"Va1PB0\">But Congress could not silence grant recipients with pro-sex work views, so long as those recipients did not use the government’s money to advance that viewpoint. The requirement that such grant recipients actively oppose sex work, according to Roberts, “compels as a condition of federal funding the affirmation of a belief that by its nature cannot be confined within the scope of the Government program.” For this reason, “it violates the First Amendment and cannot be sustained.”</p>\n<p id=\"Qw20Hg\">A similar logic could be applied to a hypothetical bill stripping MLB of its antitrust exemption or stripping Delta of its tax benefits — provided that those benefits were stripped because<em> </em>the government wished to punish these companies for exercising their First Amendment rights. Again, the government is under no obligation to provide such benefits to these companies, but it cannot condition such a benefit on a company’s silence.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Yym64N\">This Supreme Court might make it very difficult for Delta or MLB to prove its case</h3>\n<p id=\"4NartO\">Having laid out why punishing a company for expressing a political opinion violates the First Amendment, it’s worth noting that this Supreme Court — with six of its nine seats held by Republican appointees — might impose a very high burden of proof on companies that are targeted by the GOP.</p>\n<p id=\"KJxwKP\"><em>Speiser</em> and <em>Open Society International</em> were fairly easy cases because the government was quite explicit about the fact that it was conditioning a federal benefit on certain behavior by the beneficiaries. In <em>Speiser</em>, a government form made it clear that veterans must swear a loyalty oath in order to get a tax benefit. In <em>Open Society International</em>, an act of Congress explicitly stated that only groups that oppose sex work could receive certain grants.</p>\n<p id=\"pQlnJ4\">The fact that Republican lawmakers like Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Rep. Jeff Duncan (R-SC) have <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SenMikeLee/status/1378116038890377220?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1378116038890377220%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=about%3Asrcdoc\">bragged openly</a> about their plans to strip MLB of its antitrust exemption in order to punish it for exercising its First Amendment rights is powerful evidence that, if Congress were to pass such a law, it did so for unconstitutional reasons. </p>\n<p id=\"QCetTX\">But the Court has looked the other way at even more powerful evidence in the past.</p>\n<p id=\"T0HFaG\">In <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16062632215534775045&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr\"><em>Trump v. Hawaii</em></a> (2018), the Court upheld a Trump administration policy prohibiting nationals from several majority Muslim nations from traveling to the United States. It did so despite the fact that Trump and his inner circle repeatedly <a href=\"https://archive.thinkprogress.org/supreme-court-uphold-muslim-ban-ec069fe33609/\">bragged about his plans to target Muslims</a>, in violation of the Constitution’s ban on policies <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">“prohibiting the free exercise” of religion</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"PAd45M\">As a candidate for the presidency, for example, Trump called for a “total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country’s representatives can figure out what is going on.” After he was attacked for promoting an unconstitutional policy, Trump even bragged about how he would try to obfuscate the real purpose of this policy.</p>\n<p id=\"ieWe2c\">“People were so upset when I used the word Muslim,” Trump <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meet-press-july-24-2016-n615706\">told NBC’s Meet the Press</a> in 2016, “and I’m okay with that, because I’m talking territory instead of Muslim.”</p>\n<p id=\"EmovTt\">By “talking territory,” Trump meant that he would hide the real purpose of his travel ban by prohibiting people from certain nations from entering the country, rather than by explicitly banning Muslims. As Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani <a href=\"https://archive.thinkprogress.org/supreme-court-uphold-muslim-ban-ec069fe33609/\">admitted in 2017</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p id=\"vE3OXM\">So when [Trump] first announced it he said, “Muslim ban.” He called me up and said, “Put a commission together, show me the right way to do it legally.” . . . And what we did was we focused on, instead of religion, danger. The areas of the world that create danger for us. Which is a factual basis. Not a religious basis.</p></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Tv9WZT\">And yet, the Supreme Court dismissed this evidence of unconstitutional intent and upheld the travel ban challenged in the <em>Hawaii</em> case.</p>\n<p id=\"dv3mxZ\">That said, Roberts’s <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16062632215534775045&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr\">majority opinion in <em>Hawaii</em></a> focused on the extraordinary level of deference courts typically give to elected officials in national security cases. The Chief warned that “any rule of constitutional law that would inhibit” the president’s flexibility<strong> “</strong>to respond to changing world conditions should be adopted only with the greatest caution,” adding that “our inquiry into matters of entry and national security is highly constrained.”</p>\n<p id=\"KaCG5Y\">There are few, if any, national security implications to a case about antitrust laws and baseball — or about state-level tax breaks for airlines. So the Court may be more open to evidence of invidious intent in a case involving GOP retaliation against corporations than it was in the <em>Hawaii </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"plsNhh\">Republicans are playing with fire by leveling threats against companies that disagree with their stance against democracy.</p>\n\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 07 Apr 2021 14:50:00 +0000","feedId":99,"bgimg":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1rSXOGuwtGh9IrPY56OCuYSVUJs=/880x0:7948x5301/1310x983/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69089034/1308890644.0.jpg","linkMd5":"5078dbc57ade1bd627ff85dcc0a5b5aa","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn27@2020_2/2021/04/07/17-38-33-362_5243696149a5b280.webp","destWidth":1310,"destHeight":983,"sourceBytes":114717,"destBytes":64804,"author":"Ian Millhiser","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1rSXOGuwtGh9IrPY56OCuYSVUJs=/880x0:7948x5301/1310x983/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69089034/1308890644.0.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn27@2020_2/2021/04/07/17-38-33-362_5243696149a5b280.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617817112992},{"createdTime":"2021-04-08 01:38:33","updatedTime":"2021-04-08 01:38:33","title":"The power of televising Derek Chauvin’s trial","link":"https://www.vox.com/22364721/george-floyd-chauvin-trial-televised","description":"  \n\n    <figure>\n      <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WGtf5agTB1G7UM3VChNm0GTvI_g=/0x0:2299x1724/1310x983/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69088228/AP_21090694570729.0.jpg\" />\n        <figcaption>During witness testimony on March 31, bystander Charles McMillian, 61, sobbed on the stand as he listened to himself tell Floyd, “You can’t win!” | Court TV/AP</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n  <p>We saw George Floyd die on screen.

And it evoked an emotional response in a way that news reports, no matter how hard-hitting or well-edited, sometimes can’t: Chauvin held his knee on Floyd’s neck for <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/30/us/derek-chauvin-george-floyd-kneel-9-minutes-29-seconds.html\">nine minutes, 29 seconds</a>. We know because we saw it happen. We saw the video.</p>\n<p id=\"DRyFNo\">Or did we? The footage we saw showed Chauvin pinning down Floyd for eight minutes, 46 seconds. That precise span of time, established by a widely circulated video a bystander shot with their phone, has <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/18/us/george-floyd-timing.html\">become such a symbol</a> — of the horrors of police brutality in general and of Floyd’s death in particular — that it has <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_minutes_46_seconds\">its own Wikipedia page</a> filled with examples of politicians, corporations, activists, and entire cities using the number to commemorate Floyd and raise the alarm. </p>\n<p id=\"6tVmGZ\">The <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/new-york-stock-exchange-observes-moment-of-silence-in-honor-of-george-floyds-funeral-2020-06-09\">New York Stock Exchange</a> paused trading for eight minutes, 46 seconds. Google held an <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/03/google-holding-moment-of-silence-for-george-floyd-on-wednesday.html\">eight-minute-and-46-second-long “moment” of silence</a> for its employees.

Legislators took a knee. Long stretches of silence are uncomfortable; they spur people into a contemplative state. And while eight minutes, 46 seconds can be a short time, it’s an eternity if you’re staring mortality and brutality in the face.</p>\n<aside id=\"AaXDHx\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Trial by trauma \",\"url\":\"https://www.vox.com/2021/4/5/22367967/derek-chauvin-trial\"}]}'></div></aside><p id=\"RXsGtf\">But it turns out Chauvin forcibly restrained Floyd even longer than most people thought. Prosecutors revealed the full extent of their encounter during the first week of the trial — nine minutes, 29 seconds of Chauvin’s knee on Floyd’s neck — and the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/30/us/derek-chauvin-george-floyd-kneel-9-minutes-29-seconds.html\">revelation was shocking</a>. Reality was worse than the footage.</p>\n<p id=\"SQ5gnT\">It is a succinct embodiment of this moment in history that a number drawn from a video — shot on a phone, uploaded to the internet, and seen all over the world by viewers frozen in place by a virus — became such a profound symbol. </p>\n<p id=\"CYgI8O\">Before Cahill’s decision allowed TV cameras into the courtroom for Chauvin’s trial, the situation was already mediated to us through phone cameras and Twitter, through videos of protests and unrest, each one putting a frame around Floyd’s death and the events that followed, each one with a narrative in mind. Every video told a particular part of a story — some spotlighting the size and passion of peaceful crowds, others zooming in on property damage — and as the protests raged on, sometimes those stories conflicted.</p>\n<p id=\"DMen9j\">But sometimes the stories harmonized. As other video emerged (from nearby security cameras, for instance), journalists worked to widen the frame, to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/31/us/george-floyd-investigation.html\">fill in the picture</a> of what happened to Floyd. New angles and voices entered the story; the meaning of the events on May 25 became clearer. We can now witness bystanders screaming, hear what they said, understand their helplessness, and see more clearly how Floyd was treated at the hands of police.</p>\n<p id=\"BtQ1cR\">The result is that, while almost none of us were there, it may feel as though we were. That’s not new. We have seen videos of police brutality before, as far back as the beating of Rodney King in 1991. With time and technological advances, such videos have picked up force and clarity. Reading about beatings and brutality is one thing — seeing them happen is something entirely different.</p>\n<aside id=\"cIPI2i\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Questions to ask yourself before sharing images of police brutality \",\"url\":\"https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/6/11/21281028/before-sharing-images-police-brutality-protest-george-floyd-ahmaud-arbery-facebook-instagram-twitter\"}]}'></div></aside><p id=\"5izoMz\">Smartphones have turned citizens into reluctant documentarians. Major catastrophic or violent events are increasingly caught on camera. There’s almost always one snapping nearby, on someone’s phone or within a surveillance system, and from there it’s just one click to virality. Floyd’s death was recorded, but <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/identities/2020/6/9/21285536/maurice-gordon-police-shooting-explained\">so</a> <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/6/9/21285378/body-cams-police-killing-javier-ambler-filming-a-e-television-show-black-lives-matter\">are</a> those of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/6/6/21282483/manuel-ellis-black-man-killed-police-cant-breathe-george-floyd\">many</a> <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/identities/2020/5/6/21249202/ahmaud-arbery-jogger-killed-in-georgia-video-shooting-grand-jury\">others</a>, and they have been for a long time. We’re all everywhere now, seeing everything. And what we’re seeing adds to an increased awareness of systemic racism and injustice.</p>\n<p id=\"5SrHM7\">So it’s a little jarring what we don’t see while watching news footage of Chauvin’s trial. In his ruling that the trial should be televised, Cahill gave strict instructions: Floyd’s family and any witnesses who are minors could not be filmed without their consent. The cameras are not permitted to zoom in on the tables where counsel is seated, meaning no one can shoot close-ups of Chauvin or either set of attorneys. No cameraperson can create meaning by capturing reaction shots during testimony, the way you would in a cinematic courtroom drama.</p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fCVPhnyli-o3Esxr1aCuOcRD2bo=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22425044/AP_21096518583093.jpg\">\n      <cite>Court TV/AP</cite>\n      <figcaption>Hennepin County Judge Peter Cahill discusses motions before the court on April 6, 2021, in the trial of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lrOwOXs5tsHdDq3feLM6oDbJup0=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22425045/AP_21095708661812.jpg\">\n      <cite>Court TV/AP</cite>\n      <figcaption>Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo testifies.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dbxBSwFifvGksiw7aCvD87hiGeY=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22425047/AP_21095530830516.jpg\">\n      <cite>Court TV/AP</cite>\n      <figcaption>Defense attorney Eric Nelson (left) and former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"xJ2Snc\">Cahill’s rules seem designed to not only protect people in the room but also to buck the genre conventions of courtroom shows and movies. This is not fiction. This is not an action movie or a drama about characters based vaguely on real-life figures. It is not a political battle, and it is not a triumphant story of a scrappy lawyer taking on the establishment. It’s actually happening. Real lives remain at stake; actual justice is in process. Few people are in the room, but we should act like we are.</p>\n<p id=\"GIs3bA\">There’s one more rule: Jurors must be kept off camera completely. This is so important that Cahill <a href=\"https://www.cjr.org/the_media_today/george_floyd_derek_chauvin_trial_cameras.php\">ordered a plexiglass partition removed</a> during jury selection because a potential juror’s face was partially reflected in it.</p>\n<p id=\"gLDZ7L\">In doing so, Cahill was nodding to the same sentiment the prosecutors expressed in their case against a televised trial: that broadcasting the proceedings to the whole world would not just give access to the public, it would also encourage the kind of harassment that virtually anyone whose face appears on the internet can experience. In a highly politicized and volatile case such as this one — even with the rise in support for Black Lives Matter and a distrust of police that happened in the wake of Floyd’s death — that’s a real, frightening possibility.</p>\n<p id=\"cyQbyp\">Having to balance those objectives — transparency in courtroom proceedings and privacy for those who participate — reflects with crystal clarity the quandary both journalists and the justice system face today. When we’ve all seen the footage and feel like we were there, how do you <a href=\"https://www.mprnews.org/story/2021/03/25/npr-half-of-the-jury-in-the-chauvin-trial-is-non-white-thats-only-part-of-the-story\">select an impartial jury</a>? And when the audience isn’t limited to those in the room but expands to include everyone watching the live broadcast — when the whole world can tune in — does that affect the outcome?</p>\n<p id=\"REPMI2\">High-profile trials have been televised for decades, and many have drawn considerable public interest. Chauvin’s is hardly the first to become a broadcast event. And yet it feels different. Some of that feeling is thanks to the inextricable link between the public interest in this case and smartphones and the internet. </p>\n<p id=\"OUIvdf\">And some may be thanks to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/22361875/derek-chauvin-trial-witness-testimony-prosecution\">audio of the eyewitnesses’ testimony</a> and the footage emerging from the courtroom. There’s power to those images that isn’t captured in text. We have a new framework for listening to these eyewitnesses tell the story, one that has moved away from seeing victims as criminals receiving their just deserts and toward focusing on the injustice of the system around them. This trial proves something simple: No matter how viral a video of police brutality becomes, its power and pain are not diminished.</p>\n<aside id=\"NJsOFz\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"The sympathy and authority of the witnesses in the Chauvin trial\",\"url\":\"https://www.vox.com/22361875/derek-chauvin-trial-witness-testimony-prosecution\"}]}'></div></aside><p id=\"hMiwTg\">The most striking images in the first days of the trial came from witnesses who testified and sobbed in court, testifying to feeling guilty that they couldn’t do more to stop the police who held Floyd down. Watching video footage of the arrest and listening as Floyd cried out for his mother in his last moments of life, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/03/31/charles-mcmillian-chauvin-trial/\">bystander Charles McMillian broke down in tears</a> on the witness stand.</p>\n<p id=\"Aa99bB\">“I feel helpless,” McMillian told the court, explaining why he was crying. “I don’t have a mama either. I understand him.”</p>\n<p id=\"M0l63L\">The jury watched the footage, and several were similarly moved. On March 31, the proceedings were halted when one member of the jury, a white woman in her 50s, stood up and left. She felt ill — or had a “stress-related reaction,” as Cahill put it — and later returned.</p>\n<p id=\"629oPZ\">While it all happened (or hours or days later, on YouTube), we watched. We, the public, could watch the jury watch the videos and break down. Just as we did last summer, we have the opportunity to form opinions about what we’re seeing, based on images and framed by our TVs, phones, and laptops. The televised trial gives us another chance to participate, to fill in our mental pictures of what happened. To decide that we’re part of this story too.</p>\n<p id=\"FeI3fK\">Chauvin’s trial is airing on TV, but it isn’t acting like television. It has no intentional entertainment value. This isn’t the trial of O.J. Simpson or Casey Anthony. At every turn so far, Chauvin’s time in court has reminded us as viewers of our involvement, or at least our feelings of involvement, in Floyd’s death. </p>\n<p id=\"fhV18s\">More broadly, every day of the trial reinforces what some always knew and what some only started to learn last summer: There is something deeply wrong when a man dies like this, and it’s impossible to divorce emotion from logic when evaluating someone’s life. That the only reason a lot of people know about George Floyd at all — the only reason anyone’s watching Derek Chauvin’s trial in the first place — is that we’ve turned into a nation of documentarians, stitching together a narrative that’s much bigger than ourselves.</p>\n<p id=\"ZhOZhN\">Floyd’s death represented one breaking point, evidence for some who had turned away before that something was deeply wrong. But for the American public, the weeping witnesses and gut-churning testimony should be further evidence — in a way that no newspaper article or evening news segment could capture — that the story won’t end when the trial is over.</p>\n\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 07 Apr 2021 12:30:00 +0000","feedId":99,"bgimg":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WGtf5agTB1G7UM3VChNm0GTvI_g=/0x0:2299x1724/1310x983/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69088228/AP_21090694570729.0.jpg","linkMd5":"ae8f18ef004e5cf5c7bced61838e1676","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn99@2020_1/2021/04/07/17-38-33-549_5bb52b77b5595cf6.webp","destWidth":1310,"destHeight":983,"sourceBytes":86228,"destBytes":47414,"author":"Alissa Wilkinson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WGtf5agTB1G7UM3VChNm0GTvI_g=/0x0:2299x1724/1310x983/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69088228/AP_21090694570729.0.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn99@2020_1/2021/04/07/17-38-33-549_5bb52b77b5595cf6.webp","https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fCVPhnyli-o3Esxr1aCuOcRD2bo=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22425044/AP_21096518583093.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn87@2020_4/2021/04/07/17-39-07-138_76ea5e9f8ff86279.webp","https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lrOwOXs5tsHdDq3feLM6oDbJup0=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22425045/AP_21095708661812.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn92@2020_3/2021/04/07/17-39-07-088_4962548c30e43438.webp","https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dbxBSwFifvGksiw7aCvD87hiGeY=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22425047/AP_21095530830516.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn71@2020_5/2021/04/07/17-39-07-094_de0439969fd847b9.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617817113002},{"createdTime":"2021-04-08 01:38:33","updatedTime":"2021-04-08 01:38:33","title":"Will apps like PayPal and Venmo make financial inequality worse?","link":"https://www.vox.com/22367985/paypal-venmo-financial-inequality-unbanked-underbanked","description":"  \n\n    <figure>\n      <img alt=\"A person opening the PayPal app on their phone\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k6UOcTq5wQqg0Z406XSHunLDH08=/278x0:4722x3333/1310x983/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69088381/GettyImages_1230281917.0.jpg\" />\n        <figcaption>PayPal and other mobile payment apps have advantages for customers without bank accounts, but also drawbacks. | Photo Illustration by Rafael Henrique/SOPA Images/LightRocket/Getty Images</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n  <p>Mobile apps like Venmo, PayPal, and more are filling in some gaps for customers without bank accounts. But there are big drawbacks, too. </p> <p id=\"X3oSN4\">Evelynn Jones used to have a bank account with Bank of America. She lost her bank account after depositing a fraudulent check she received in the mail. So today, Jones, a freelancer who works in marketing, primarily uses three alternatives: Fidelity, PayPal, and Stripe. </p>\n<p id=\"7losWQ\">After her mother died, Jones inherited her mom’s 401(k) account, leading her to use a Fidelity cash management account for her personal transactions. For her business transactions, she primarily uses PayPal and Stripe. She’s using the latter of the two more, because her client management software HoneyBook processes payments with Stripe. </p>\n<p id=\"FKalQb\">Jones is among others who rely on mobile payment apps. A <a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/banking/mobile-payment-app-survey\">February 2020 Nerdwallet survey</a> found that nearly 4 in 5 respondents use mobile payment apps, including Venmo, Cash App, Apple Pay, and PayPal. Among the most common reasons people use the apps are to transfer funds to family or significant others (61 percent), pay for online purchases (40 percent), and send funds to friends (37 percent), the Nerdwallet survey found.  </p>\n<p id=\"IbmkYd\">According to <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/2020-economic-well-being-of-us-households-in-2019-banking-and-credit.htm\">a May 2020 Federal Reserve report</a>, in 2019, 6 percent of adults were unbanked — without a bank account — and 16 percent were underbanked, or had a bank account, but relied on services like payday loans, check cashing services, or money orders. The Fed also noted that unbanked and underbanked consumers were more likely to have less education or to be part of a racial or ethnic minority group.</p>\n<p id=\"0eeqTi\">As underbanked and unbanked consumers use payment apps to conveniently send cash to others, manage their money better, and access otherwise out-of-reach financial services, these tools can also come with costly fees, a lack of customer service, and cybersecurity risks. If left unaddressed, payment apps could further replicate offline inequality for unbanked or underbanked users. </p>\n<div class=\"c-float-right\"><div id=\"9byTNb\"><div data-anthem-component=\"aside:9574455\"></div></div></div>\n<p id=\"FLeQrp\">Mobile payment apps appear to be fairly popular among millennials and Gen Z consumers. Millennials are among the top users of mobile payment apps (94 percent), followed by Gen Z consumers (87 percent), Nerdwallet’s survey found. </p>\n<p id=\"KOIReo\">“I bet Gen Zers are shooting up there really fast, because a lot of them are kind of aging into college years and probably sending money to each other that way,” said Chanelle Bessette, a banking specialist at Nerdwallet, noting that its survey came just before the Covid-19 pandemic took hold. “A lot of people just have payment apps built into their phones, like Google Pay or Apple Pay, which can be either digital wallets or a way to store money and send it to each other. So I feel like every payment app has different features that make it cool for unique reasons.”</p>\n<h3 id=\"tSmx2p\">So why are payment apps good for people with and without bank accounts?  </h3>\n<p id=\"zlh3Ds\">Given the cleanliness concerns spurred by the Covid-19 pandemic, mobile payments have generally been used for contactless transactions and thus are better for public health, said Beibei Li, associate professor of IT and management at Carnegie Mellon University. For underbanked customers, in particular, mobile payment apps allow consumers to access their money without needing to go to an ATM, which can be inconvenient for people in low-income communities with fewer ATM locations nearby, Li said.</p>\n<p id=\"PyEjq3\">For Jones, PayPal is especially helpful to her as a freelancer because it tracks and organizes business transactions and makes it easy to search for specific transactions. It made sense to hold her funds in Stripe, and PayPal made sense given that clients often use those platforms to transfer anyway, she said. </p>\n<p id=\"0nAdhC\">Li noted that, <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2912691\">according to her research examining payment apps</a> and other mobile banking apps, consumers were able to better manage their money, including incurring fewer overdraft and late credit card payment fees.</p>\n<p id=\"t4ZRFP\">“It seems like these mobile applications are able to facilitate better for people’s financial management in general. We definitely see that there is a benefit for disadvantaged [groups],” Li said. </p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8D2tlJIUyj-XWH9vg1Jgy5o1cAY=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22421642/GettyImages_1199502793.jpg\">\n      <cite>Justin Sullivan/Getty Images</cite>\n      <figcaption>ATMs can be dirty, or rare in some neighborhoods.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"Kyq3Fp\">For consumers with family in other countries, sending funds through payment apps could allow them to transact through the payment app itself rather than depositing those accounts directly, depending on the circumstances, Bessette said. </p>\n<p id=\"s0BsmX\">Some payment apps can load funds onto a prepaid card and add that card to their account as a workaround for unbanked consumers, she added.  </p>\n<h3 id=\"1lJVUo\">Could payment apps create digital inequality?</h3>\n<p id=\"lFsU4T\">Citing banks’ focus on shareholders and their bottom line, Jones expressed skepticism in the trustworthiness of banks; however, she decided to open an account with Lili, a mobile bank targeting freelancers. But payment apps come with their own headaches: fees, customer service, ATM access, and the financial documents that platforms provide. </p>\n<p id=\"3GGw60\">Jones has pivoted to freelancing more than once, and her latest stint started in March 2019, before the pandemic began. When charging clients for freelance work, Jones builds the PayPal fees into her hourly and project rates. She once tallied up the fees that went to the payment platform and realized that those funds could have been reinvested into the business.</p>\n<p id=\"eJy1Zs\">Both traditional bank accounts and payment apps can come with fees, Bessette noted.  Though cash-strapped consumers may be hit with costly overdraft fees, payment apps often come with their own fees for credit card transactions and can result in interest for charges that aren’t quickly paid off, she said. However, like other financial services firms, payment apps have also been introducing their own credit and debit cards to withdraw from their digital accounts. </p>\n<div class=\"c-float-right\"><aside id=\"rjQYIe\"><q>“It’s just a way for these companies to keep people on their platform”</q></aside></div>\n<p id=\"KCxZ9Y\">“I think it’s really interesting because it’s just a way for these companies to keep people on their platform,” Bessette said. “I see that trend happening, and I think payment apps are trying to do something similar where they capture customers into their financial ecosystem. A lot of people don’t necessarily change bank accounts super often, so they end up using Venmo or Cash App much more frequently for banking-type services.”</p>\n<p id=\"BLxxAD\">Though Jones’s experience with PayPal was fine, payment apps broadly have a hands-off approach to customer service, opting to provide users with guides rather than a person to assist users with inquiries, she said. Lauren Saunders, associate director of the National Consumer Law Center, also pointed out the lack of a customer service infrastructure for payment apps. Unlike traditional banks, payment apps don’t have neighborhood brick-and-mortar branches where customers can get one-on-one service, Saunders said. </p>\n<p id=\"JXuRDp\">“Technology works great until it doesn’t,” Saunders said. “For lower-income people who may just have a phone, it’s harder to bang out long emails and to research on the internet, or ... they may not have the time to spend on the phone on hold for hours on end trying to hope that they can get to a real person.” </p>\n<p id=\"hwYEhm\">When Jones was searching for an apartment, she found that PayPal’s reports didn’t quite help with documenting her income to landlords. The apartment hunt has been more difficult for her as a self-employed person than it typically would be for salaried renters, and it would be helpful to have reports that illustrate her recurring income, she said. </p>\n<p id=\"xKxNcJ\">Echoing similar concerns, Li said that low-income customers’ payment app transaction data aren’t included in their creditworthiness assessments, meaning possibly eligible consumers could be excluded from traditional financial services. As traditional financial services firms use more machine learning algorithms to conduct consumer risk assessments, their data may not take payment app transactions into account, which can overlook the full picture of a customer’s spending habits, she said. </p>\n<p id=\"YHTxAr\">“It helps the financial services to better evaluate the risk of these historically disadvantaged populations and try to serve them better by understanding their financial risk,” Li said. </p>\n<p id=\"mtjiUt\">But if banks begin harnessing payment app data to assess risk, they should do so with privacy in mind, Li advised. Underbanked consumers could, for example, opt to share some of their social media and financial activities using Venmo to access certain financial services that are otherwise out of reach, she said. A <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3758120\">2020 paper co-authored by Li</a> indicated that analyzing consumers’ financial risk using smartphone usage can make financial products more available to a wider range of consumers. </p>\n<p id=\"nZvxrc\">Besides fees and lack of accessible customer service, Saunders also raised concerns about the digital hurdles and security risks that could be especially damaging to unbanked or underbanked consumers. </p>\n<div class=\"c-float-left\"><aside id=\"OZpRnb\"><q>“Technology works great until it doesn’t”</q></aside></div>\n<p id=\"TgpbqH\">For payment app users without secure wifi, public wifi networks are less secure than using the available 3G, 4G, or 5G internet on a smartphone, Bessette said. Per <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/04/22/some-americans-dont-use-the-internet-who-are-they/\">a 2021 Pew Research Center report</a>, 7 percent of all US adults don’t use the internet, down from 48 percent in 2000. Access varies by geography: 6 percent of suburban adults said they aren’t online, compared to 5 percent in urban areas and 10 percent in rural areas. What matters even more is income and education. While just 1 percent of adults making more than $75,000 a year don’t have internet, 14 percent of adults making less than $30,000 don’t have it, Pew reports.</p>\n<p id=\"nalHFp\">So, for unbanked and underbanked consumers who mainly conduct transactions via cell phones, they may face technological constraints if their phone is out of date, or if they live in a rural area with poor connectivity, Saunders said. On top of that, low-income consumers may only have limited data plans or use prepaid phones, meaning their experience of mobile banking tools could be quite different, she added. </p>\n<p id=\"iql5Iu\">Among the top concerns Saunders has about payment apps are the scams or mistakes on the part of consumers. Unlike traditional banks, payment apps either offer little to no fraud protection for consumers who become victims of scams or mistakenly transfer funds to the wrong person, she said. </p>\n<p id=\"VeEQ7I\">Per <a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/banking/mobile-payment-app-survey\">Nerdwallet’s survey</a>, less than a third (28 percent) of mobile payment app users are buying goods from strangers online. On average, users hold $287 in their accounts before transferring the funds into their bank accounts, the survey found. </p>\n<p id=\"cmxZWM\">Of course, these scams could happen to anyone. Saunders said her son almost sent his security deposit on an apartment to a possible scammer. She also heard from a colleague who received money from a stranger who later frantically called requesting the funds back. Both her colleague and the stranger called their respective financial institutions, but they wouldn’t intervene. </p>\n<p id=\"t60Pf0\">“If you’re low-income, obviously, every dollar counts and anything that you lose to a scammer or to a mistake is all the more devastating,” Saunders said. “You should not use these apps if speed is not important and if you’ve got another way to send money. Because if somebody is insisting that they get paid through one of these apps, your alarm bells should go up.”</p>\n<p id=\"GPk217\">Jones said she’s aware of the risks associated with payment apps, but rather than keep her funds all in one spot, she thinks it’s wise to have wealth distributed across various assets, including cash, investments, or even precious metals. </p>\n<p id=\"8IcTNY\">She said she’d like to see banks invest even more in the community and make it easier for new customers to sign up. Unlike regular banks, payment apps don’t require a deposit to open the account, she noted.</p>\n<p id=\"vjrlxk\">Banks are “like a relationship, going into a marriage,” Jones observed. With “payment apps, you can date. I use PayPal. I use Stripe. You’re dating PayPal. You’re dating Stripe. You’re dabbling with Cash App and Venmo. You can have multiple, and it’s quick to sign up.”</p>\n\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 07 Apr 2021 13:00:00 +0000","feedId":99,"bgimg":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k6UOcTq5wQqg0Z406XSHunLDH08=/278x0:4722x3333/1310x983/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69088381/GettyImages_1230281917.0.jpg","linkMd5":"eb55962fd8e0809d12bedcb639076184","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn4@2020_5/2021/04/07/17-38-33-482_95ba408acfb7ad4b.webp","destWidth":1310,"destHeight":983,"sourceBytes":97484,"destBytes":50052,"author":"Tatiana Walk-Morris","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k6UOcTq5wQqg0Z406XSHunLDH08=/278x0:4722x3333/1310x983/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69088381/GettyImages_1230281917.0.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn4@2020_5/2021/04/07/17-38-33-482_95ba408acfb7ad4b.webp","https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8D2tlJIUyj-XWH9vg1Jgy5o1cAY=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22421642/GettyImages_1199502793.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn79@2020_4/2021/04/07/17-39-07-150_6bdbe68e165d2493.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617817113009},{"createdTime":"2021-04-08 01:38:32","updatedTime":"2021-04-08 01:38:32","title":"The number of billionaires spiked by 30% during the pandemic","link":"https://www.vox.com/recode/2021/4/6/22370351/billionaires-forbes-inequality-pandemic","description":"  \n\n    <figure>\n      <img alt=\"Demonstrators protest outside Amazon headquarters, holding a sign reading “Tax Bezos”.\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dHljWhTFabpC4J0-8YuHi91SRIU=/234x0:3967x2800/1310x983/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69085902/1229825564.0.jpg\" />\n        <figcaption>The rise in billionaires’ net worths during the Covid-19 pandemic has reinvigorated the debate about their role in society. | David Ryder/Bloomberg/Getty Images</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n  <p>It’s easy to lose track of the numbers. But you shouldn’t.</p> <p id=\"AlnwET\">The total number of billionaires exploded over the course of the coronavirus pandemic — and they individually became extraordinarily wealthier during the last 12 months.</p>\n<p id=\"55awxd\">That’s according to <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/billionaires/\">a new report from Forbes</a>, which does one of the most complete analyses each spring about the state of the billionaire class across the globe. Tracking the net worths of the wealthy is painstaking work that requires sifting through arcane filings; the end results are not perfect, but the estimates offered by Forbes represent one of the best stabs at covering the scale of income inequality in the world. And while it’s easy to lose track of the numbers or to see the figures as old news — “Billionaires continue to be billionaires” — the scale matters for anyone who wants to get a grasp on how much of a problem wealth inequality truly is. </p>\n<p id=\"8utqew\">The world is now home to 2,755 billionaires, a world record and a startling 30 percent increase from Forbes’s accounting last year of the world’s uber-rich. And 86 percent of those billionaires are richer than they were a year ago. The list does paint an exaggerated picture of some of the pandemic gains because it compares today’s net worths to Forbes’s <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbespr/2020/04/07/forbes-publishes-34th-annual-list-of-global-billionaires/?sh=4c906a043edf\">last analysis in mid-March 2020</a>, when the market had yet to recover from the early pandemic-inspired sell-off.</p>\n<p id=\"ANhOZX\">The pandemic has <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/recode/22356742/billionaires-amazon-jeff-bezos-rich-philanthropy-coronavirus-election\">reinvigorated the debate over inequality</a>, with nations like Argentina adopting a wealth tax and other <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/01/business/elizabeth-warren-wealth-tax.html\">similar proposals gaining a foothold</a> in the United States. In the US, many Americans <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/01/upshot/why-markets-boomed-2020.html\">have more personal income and savings than they had before</a> the pandemic, thanks in part to unprecedented government stimulus measures. But at the same time, demand for food pantries smashed records and the economy shed about 10 million jobs. <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/4/7/21203179/coronavirus-billionaires-philanthropy-bill-gates-larry-ellison-mark-zuckerberg-jack-dorsey\">Billionaire philanthropists have played center stage</a> in America’s recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"HVJ1lJ\"><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/recode/22356742/billionaires-amazon-jeff-bezos-rich-philanthropy-coronavirus-election\">Perhaps no statistic better encapsulates</a> the scale of the yawning inequality than that MacKenzie Scott, the former wife of Jeff Bezos and one of the wealthiest people in the world, probably gave more money away directly to nonprofits in 2020 than any person has in a single year ever before. Yet because of Amazon’s surging stock price, she actually <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/denizcam/2021/04/06/how-mackenzie-scott-gave-away-nearly-6-billion-last-year-and-ended-up-richer/?sh=6fa67cac68cc\">ended the year richer</a>, Forbes reports.</p>\n<p id=\"paTmpY\">Forbes finds that the tech set, like Scott, fared particularly well. Six of the world’s 10 richest people made their money in tech, and the total assets controlled by all tech billionaires globally measures $2.5 trillion, far more than any other industry. Neither of those figures includes Tesla and SpaceX founder Elon Musk, who is classified by Forbes as in the automotive industry but has ridden Tesla’s extraordinary bull run to become <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/recode/22218999/elon-musk-richest-person-world-jeff-bezos\">the second-richest person in the world</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"6RE0xE\">That’s all to say that the debate over wealth inequality isn’t going anywhere, even when the pandemic fades away.

News footage of the island’s cemetery showed trenches being filled with pine coffins, sending shockwaves around the world. But these mass burials taking place during the pandemic are just the most recent in Hart Island’s long history.</p>\n<p id=\"78A5ot\">Hart Island’s potter’s field cemetery dates back to 1869, and for over 150 years has served as a burial ground for over 1 million New Yorkers. Over the years, infrastructure problems and a lack of reliable public access have earned Hart Island a tainted reputation. </p>\n<p id=\"mqjgJ3\">A <a href=\"https://www.thecity.nyc/missing-them/2021/3/24/22349311/nyc-covid-victims-destined-for-hart-island-potters-field\">2021 analysis</a> by Columbia Journalism School’s Stabile Center and <a href=\"https://www.thecity.nyc/\">THE CITY</a> found that over 2,300 New Yorkers were buried on Hart Island in 2020. That’s more burials than any year during the AIDS epidemic, another recent health crisis.</p>\n<p id=\"AobFhz\">Stabile and THE CITY also found that New York City is on pace to bury one in 10 Covid-19 victims on the island.</p>\n<p id=\"IHwzVd\">The analysis shows who is more likely to be buried on Hart Island: Black and Latinx residents, front-line workers, and those with little access to health care. </p>\n<p id=\"FwjgfO\">To understand how this ties together and what’s next for Hart Island, watch the video above.

The ER visits left him with about $2,000 in medical bills. It’s going to take a minute: He makes $7.25 an hour working as a cashier at Dollar Tree.</p>\n<p id=\"0HD3oI\">Before I called Jordan, who lives in Kentucky, to talk about what his life is like making the minimum wage, he explained to me that I’d need to dial him on a Kindle tablet. He can’t afford to fix his broken phone at the moment. “It’s not exactly a long-term solution,” he says. But for the time being, it’ll have to do.</p>\n<p id=\"Uz5EGV\">Jordan isn’t the type to ask for much, even for Christmas or his birthday. While he recognizes he could probably go on disability for a while until his health gets better, he’s too stubborn. “I’ve always been taught when I was growing up that unless you absolutely can’t do something, then try to do something,” he said. He lives with his mom and kicks in money for the rent when he can.</p>\n<p id=\"d9iuuu\">I ask him what he thinks would be a fairer wage, one that would make his life a little easier. He says $10 an hour, though he knows that his coworkers who are older and have kids would need more, like $15. </p>\n<aside id=\"O43hEV\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"The $15 minimum wage is effectively dead — for now \",\"url\":\"https://www.vox.com/2021/2/25/22299034/15-dollar-minimum-wage-senate-parliamentarian\"}]}'></div></aside><p id=\"aVT7K9\">Still, he worries a higher federal minimum wage might hurt small businesses, a talking point often spouted by opponents of increasing the minimum wage. But Jordan doesn’t work for a small business: He works for a multibillion-dollar corporation that has been doing gangbuster sales during the pandemic. The day after we spoke, Dollar Tree <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/03/business/dollar-tree-new-stores-family-dollar/index.html\">announced</a> it would open 600 new stores this year and <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210303005314/en/Dollar-Tree-Inc.-Reports-Results-for-the-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2020#:~:text=Full%20Year%20Fiscal%202020%20Results&amp;text=Dollar%20Tree%20same%2Dstore%20sales%20increased%202.2%25.,related%20to%20COVID%2D19%20costs.\">buy back $2 billion more</a> of its shares.</p>\n<p id=\"xKSkCf\">America purports to be a country of workers — a place where if you try hard enough, put in the time and effort, you’ll make it to the middle class, or at the very least be able to build a solid life. But that version of America <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/22332438/minimum-wage-unemployment-democrats\">doesn’t line up with the reality</a>: As of 2019, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/03/03/15-minimum-wage-black-hispanic-women/\">39 million people made less than $15 an hour</a>. The federal minimum wage has been stuck at $7.25 since 2009, and <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/minimum-wage/2019/home.htm#:~:text=The%20percentage%20of%20hourly%20paid,collected%20on%20a%20regular%20basis.\">1.6 million workers</a> make that amount or less. Many low-wage workers <a href=\"https://www.cbpp.org/research/food-assistance/snap-helps-millions-of-low-wage-workers\">rely on public assistance to get by</a>. <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/07/23/are-you-in-the-american-middle-class/\">Pew Research Center</a> defines “middle-income” households in the US as starting at about $48,000; a $15 minimum wage at 40 hours a week adds up to $30,000; at $7.25, it’s $15,000.</p>\n<p id=\"2fry7R\">In recent weeks, I spoke with more than a dozen workers across the country making under $15 about how their wages shape their lives.</p>\n<p id=\"SebmmY\">Some echoed arguments against a higher minimum wage, or at the very least, expressed concerns about its implications. Jordan said he’s heard warnings that increasing wages too much, too fast could push up prices and cost jobs. The <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/11/20/20952151/should-minimum-wage-be-raised\">evidence suggests</a> a higher minimum wage would be a net positive for workers, but those concerns are understandable. When you’re living on the margins, it’s scary when your boss starts talking about cutting jobs, or when you imagine the price of groceries you can already barely afford going up even slightly.</p>\n<p id=\"oLccJ3\">Everyone I talked to said that more money in their paychecks would make it easier to pay their bills, add to their savings, and maybe even let them take a vacation. Some workers talked about feeling held back from life transitions, such as moving out of their parents’ homes, or, in one woman’s case, delaying her decision to get a divorce. Others talked about the stresses higher wages would relieve — even something as simple as being able to put some bills on autopay, delete the DoorDash app they use for extra cash, or take a day off.</p>\n<h3 id=\"DFVXK5\">“It’s completely impossible to live on $8.50” </h3>\n<p id=\"ygIOKN\">The political impetus to increase the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour is growing. Many cities and states have already begun to gradually phase in wage hikes, and while Democrats failed to get $15 by 2025 into the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2021/3/10/22320350/stimulus-bill-covid-19-passes-house\">$1.9 trillion stimulus bill</a> passed in March, the fight for $15 continues. </p>\n<p id=\"QQOyzI\">Minimum wage increases are popular: A <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2021/2/24/22299029/poll-majority-support-15-minimum-wage-democrats\">recent Vox/Data for Progress poll found 61 percent of voters</a> supported Democrats’ plan to gradually increase the minimum wage to $15 by 2025. But some low-wage workers still have anxieties about a federal wage increase, even though their current situations aren’t particularly sustainable, and though they know their lives and those of their coworkers would be much better on a more livable wage.</p>\n<p id=\"eGbwh1\">When I talked to Anna, 19, who balances a pair of jobs at Red Lobster and Domino’s on $8.50 an hour, she seemed conflicted about the conversation around a $15 minimum wage. (She asked me to use a pseudonym because she was afraid of being fired.) She’s on a “two-year plan” to save up for school to be a nursing aide, and making more would help her save faster. She also recognizes that many of her colleagues who are much older than her and have families are “barely making it” on the low wages they’re paid. “It’s completely impossible to live on $8.50,” she says.</p>\n<p id=\"1Ufjjk\">But she’s also heard warnings that increasing the minimum wage would be harmful. She said she worries it would increase automation, because companies would replace workers with robots, or cause inflation, because they would pass on the cost of higher wages to customers. </p>\n<p id=\"8Tdno1\">I told her that the evidence on minimum wage increases doesn’t really support that, that wages going up for a lot of people doesn’t necessarily mean a bunch of jobs would disappear or that there would be some other disastrous impact on the economy. (<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/11/20/20952151/should-minimum-wage-be-raised\">Vox’s Dylan Matthews has a great breakdown of the evidence here</a>.) But it’s hard to be definitive: Economic theories and estimates can’t erase fears that even in a scenario of very few losers, you could be one of them. Especially if, because you’ve been paid so little, you haven’t been able to build up savings to fall back on.</p>\n<h3 id=\"fnUUPn\">“Every time I get some money, something happens” </h3>\n<p id=\"NHw81B\">Dave Mayton likes his job as a Domino’s delivery driver in Pennsylvania — after all, he has “a million and one pizza jokes” — but trying to survive on $7.25 plus tips is tough, especially with the pizza company’s pre-tipping system. “Domino’s suggests these really ridiculously small amounts. Like 49 cents is an adequate tip to deliver a pizza,” Mayton says.</p>\n<p id=\"CUzIOx\">He emphasizes he doesn’t want a “pity party,” he just wants to be able to more comfortably get by. “Eating, paying for health insurance, all the bills that normal people have — those don’t go away just because you don’t make a lot of money, those things all exist,” he says.</p>\n<div class=\"c-float-right c-float-hang\"><aside id=\"hHMyPR\"><q>Walmart, which clocked a record $152 billion in revenue in the fourth quarter of 2020, pays $11 an hour for entry-level positions, though it says its average is above $15</q></aside></div>\n<p id=\"nHzLtn\">What many minimum-wage workers say isn’t that they necessarily want to live in luxury (though that would be nice), but that it would just be good to be able to, well, live. It’s hard to pinch pennies at every corner, or to have to be so sensitive to every single price fluctuation. Pennsylvania, where Mayton lives, has the highest gas tax in the country, so he drives to Maryland to get gas — it’s about a 30-mile round trip.</p>\n<p id=\"pzmBgO\">According to MIT’s <a href=\"https://livingwage.mit.edu/\">living wage calculator</a>, the federal minimum wage of $7.25 isn’t enough for full-time workers to cover their basic expenses in any state in the union. A single person without kids making the federal minimum wage and working full-time, with no time off or vacations, makes about $3,000 above <a href=\"https://aspe.hhs.gov/poverty-guidelines\">the poverty line</a>. The minute you start to add in dependents, they fall below it.</p>\n<p id=\"IhjwQq\">Mendy Hughes, an associate at Walmart in Arkansas and mother of four, laid out the myriad strategies she employs to save. She puts off bills in order to buy food, which often amounts to a swing through the drive-through after work, or Lunchables and TV dinners — things she can afford. She figures she’s put more money into her car than it’s worth, but she doesn’t have enough for a new one. The stimulus checks she’s received during the pandemic helped, but she spent them fast. “Every time I get some money, something happens, it seems like,” says Hughes, who is a member of United for Respect, a worker advocacy group.</p>\n<p id=\"5LS2gN\">Hughes isn’t alone: <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/2020-update-supplemental-appendixes-report-economic-well-being-us-households-appendix-b.htm\">Nearly 4 in 10 households say</a> they wouldn’t be able to cover a $400 emergency with cash, savings, or a credit card charge they could pay off the next month.</p>\n<p id=\"ySrzUm\">She says she makes about $11.85 right now. In a world where she’d make more, Hughes imagines being able to afford more food, save for emergencies, and maybe take a day off of work. In September, Walmart <a href=\"https://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/2020/09/17/investing-in-our-associates-and-roles-of-the-future\">said it would raise wages</a> for 165,000 workers in its bakery, deli, and auto care roles. And this February, the company <a href=\"https://s2.q4cdn.com/056532643/files/doc_financials/2021/q4/Q4FY21-Earnings-Release_Final.pdf\">announced</a> it would increase pay for 425,000 workers in its digital and stocking areas from $13 to $19 an hour. That still leaves out <a href=\"https://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/company-facts\">hundreds of thousands</a> of its associates, including Hughes, a cashier. “I don’t think that’s right,” she says. “Why give raises to some but not all?”</p>\n<p id=\"IqBmhL\">Walmart, which clocked a record $152 billion in revenue in the fourth quarter of 2020, pays $11 an hour for entry-level positions, though it says its average is above $15. Its CEO, Doug McMillon, <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/walmart-pay-minimum-wage-ceo-why-not-15-per-hour-2021-2-1030098176\">said</a> that its February pay increase for some workers was meant to create a “ladder of opportunity” and that the increases were geared toward people “who have been with us for a longer period of time.” Hughes has been at Walmart for more than a decade.</p>\n<h3 id=\"R1CVGP\">“I want to know how much the people make who say $15 is too much” </h3>\n<p id=\"JCKetj\">Many workers are skeptical of their employers’ intentions — after all, business is business. For low-wage workers, the tactics their bosses use to get around paying them more, or to incentivize them to do more, can be particularly painful.</p>\n<p id=\"Cw2tW0\">Dora Gutierrez, a certified nursing assistant in Texas, works three 12-hour shifts a week at a local hospital. She started at $9 an hour, but thanks to her union, she’s now at $13.68, though she believes $15 would be “awesome” and help her even more. Her husband is a disabled veteran, so she balances work with taking care of him.</p>\n<p id=\"4rsYrZ\">During the pandemic, Gutierrez says the hospital has offered extra pay — but only for people who were able to work more hours, which she couldn’t. “If I’m going to pick up extra shifts, I’ve got to find somebody to take care of my husband,” she says. “They want you to go kill yourself before they’re going to give you anything extra.”</p>\n<div class=\"c-float-right c-float-hang\"><aside id=\"Khyvi0\"><q>About 8 percent of US workers had more than one job as of early 2018, and women and low-wage workers were likelier to hold multiple jobs</q></aside></div>\n<p id=\"3rzdgY\">Laura, who works for an industrial supply company in Texas and asked to use a pseudonym out of fear of retribution from her company, expressed some similar sentiments. She makes $11 plus commission, which doesn’t sound bad “until you realize it’s a small town and you realize there’s not much to sell,” she says, especially during the pandemic. “They’ve done everything in their power to where they don’t have to pay benefits,” she says, explaining that they’re careful to keep her and her coworkers’ hours just below full-time. Until recently, she had a second job, and she feels fortunate that her mom is able to help pay her rent — for now.</p>\n<p id=\"ZwUs9z\"><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-multiple-jobs/share-of-u-s-workers-holding-multiple-jobs-is-rising-new-census-report-shows-idUSKBN2AH2PI\">About 8 percent of US workers</a> had more than one job as of early 2018, and women and low-wage workers were likelier to hold multiple jobs. People working more than one job tend to earn less than people with just one job. </p>\n<p id=\"VmemQo\">According to the <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t08.htm\">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>, some 5.8 million workers are working part-time for economic reasons — their hours were cut, or they can’t find full-time jobs. They’d rather work 40 hours, but they can’t find work that lets them do that.</p>\n<p id=\"19737t\">“I want to know how much the people make who say $15 is too much and minimum wage is livable, or how much they’ve ever made,” Laura says. “I’ve tried to have this discussion with people that I’m living off of $11 an hour and it’s barely livable only because I’m not having to pay my own rent, and they call me stupid because they say I should get a different job or manage my money better.”</p>\n<p id=\"tV1hJG\">For some workers, it’s hard not to wonder whether those extra hours are worth it. For others, not going above and beyond means not putting food on the table. </p>\n<p id=\"Cu9IrJ\">DeSean Smith, a student who’s currently working at a grocery store in Philadelphia to help pay his tuition, says he’s just tired of working so hard for $9.25 an hour. “It’s like saving one grain of rice a day,” he says. “You know the company’s making X amount of money, and for the amount of work they ask employees to do — coming in on off days, coming in early, staying late, dealing with customers — I’m not doing it for fun.”</p>\n<p id=\"RXNhh6\">Neither is Cindy Casey, who manages a Burger King in Georgia. She told me she works some 60 hours a week to try to make enough to keep her and her family afloat, since she’s their main source of income. She makes $14 an hour in a full-time role and then puts in an extra 15 to 20 hours a week of overtime just to pay her bills, and she feels like she’s expected to be on call 24/7. “I’m exhausted all the time from working so much,” she says. </p>\n<p id=\"hw1zee\">And even though she’s managing the franchise where she works, she still can’t afford the health insurance the company offered. “It’s so ridiculously expensive,” she says. </p>\n<h3 id=\"k2bMOt\">“It feels like it’s keeping me from moving on in my life” </h3>\n<p id=\"AdC0gE\">For some low-wage workers, their pay isn’t just an issue of what is (or isn’t) in their bank account and whether they can (or can’t) pay their bills. It also delays life transitions, harms their health, and causes stress and emotional distress. Saving for a down payment on a house or a security deposit on your own apartment when you’re making $8, $10, $12 an hour isn’t an easy task.</p>\n<p id=\"u0bl3n\">Some of the younger workers I spoke with were still living with their parents, and acknowledged that unless and until they got higher-paying jobs, they wouldn’t be able to strike out on their own. “I would have liked to have moved out and be living on my own right now, but I know with the money I’m making now, things would not be much better for me,” says Adam, a Walmart worker in Virginia in his late 20s. “It feels like it’s keeping me from moving on in my life.”</p>\n<p id=\"mpTZNX\">He told me he wished there were a Costco, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2021/02/25/971338686/costco-to-raise-minimum-wage-to-16-an-hour-this-isnt-altruism\">which pays $16 an hour</a>, in his area.</p>\n<p id=\"itwQQV\">For many people in the US, getting their own place on the current minimum wage is outright impossible. According to <a href=\"https://reports.nlihc.org/oor\">a report</a> from the National Low Income Housing Coalition,  there isn’t a single state in the country where people making the minimum wage can afford to rent a one-bedroom apartment at fair market prices while working full-time. Even taking into account states and cities with higher minimum wages, the average minimum-wage worker would need to work 79 hours a week to pay rent on a one-bedroom apartment and 97 hours for a two-bedroom. </p>\n<p id=\"nqGqvZ\">Sarah, a former library worker in Colorado, says she was “terrified” that she wouldn’t be able to keep a roof over her head when figuring out whether to separate from her husband, who had been the breadwinner in her family. She’s now divorced, but it’s been a big adjustment to her lifestyle. Until recently, she lived with a roommate on a street “that in my previous life was where all the one-step-away-from-homeless people lived.” She’s now moved to another part of the country to try to get a fresh start and has picked up some gig work to try to make more money.</p>\n<p id=\"tt4lLs\">“To me, the big visual is the refrigerator, and how much is in there, and my own daughter coming over and saying, ‘Oh, my goodness, you don’t have anything,’” she says. “There’s not really a lot for anything extra.”</p>\n<p id=\"dP6HeW\">James, a Papa John’s delivery driver in Florida, works the night shift so he can take care of his mother and grandmother, both of whom have health problems, during the day. This is his first job in the service industry, and it’s changed the way he thinks about the minimum wage — he didn’t realize how hard it was to get by on so little, or who low-wage workers really were. </p>\n<p id=\"Z22glk\">“I went into this thinking that people that work for minimum wage in the service industry are, generally speaking, a kid in high school and a retired person looking for something to do in their free time, and that’s not the case,” he says. “I think there’s a misconception in this country about what being a minimum-wage or near-minimum-wage worker is.” </p>\n<p id=\"9kxshc\">When talking about what wages they felt would be fairer, or how making more would change their lives, all the workers I spoke with said they’d of course like to make more money. But many of them also emphasized they didn’t want to come off as greedy — they didn’t want to seem like they had some sob story, or that they weren’t aware there weren’t others worse off than themselves. They just wanted to do, well, better for all of the work they were putting in.</p>\n<p id=\"RFXAOQ\">“We don’t want to be poor, either,” Mayton, the Domino’s driver, said at the close of our conversation. “I don’t expect to be rich, I just expect to pay the heat bill.”</p>\n\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 07 Apr 2021 14:00:00 +0000","feedId":99,"bgimg":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ArhyVNFwXtVrBAP4FXOI5gpR5ds=/309x0:2976x2000/1310x983/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69088786/GettyImages_1206912731.0.jpg","linkMd5":"450a01ed230e5652f0389cb3d524ca39","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn8@2020_6/2021/04/07/17-38-33-550_cc80621c086c4318.webp","destWidth":1310,"destHeight":983,"sourceBytes":228017,"destBytes":167558,"author":"Emily Stewart","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ArhyVNFwXtVrBAP4FXOI5gpR5ds=/309x0:2976x2000/1310x983/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69088786/GettyImages_1206912731.0.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn8@2020_6/2021/04/07/17-38-33-550_cc80621c086c4318.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617817112981},{"createdTime":"2021-04-08 01:38:33","updatedTime":"2021-04-08 01:38:33","title":"The replication crisis devastated psychology.

Chartier is a psychologist, and he also started to think of how precise the eclipse forecast was. Astronomers knew, down to the second, when the moon would cross the path of the sun; where, precisely, its shadow would land; and for how many seconds the sun would appear to be blocked out for those on the ground. </p>\n<p id=\"0YsUKp\">Chartier’s field — social psychology — just doesn’t have that type of accuracy. “Things are really messy,” says Chartier, who’s an associate professor at Ashland University in Ohio. Psychology “is nowhere near being at the level of precision of astronomers, or physicists.”  </p>\n<p id=\"CXFBfY\">Things in psychology are more than messy — the field has been going through a very public, and painful, crisis of confidence in many of its findings. So he began to wonder: How could psychology one day wow the world with precise science of its own? </p>\n<p id=\"lhv54j\">His idea was audacious: psychologists all around the world, working together to rigorously push the science forward. But it quickly became real: The Psychological Science Accelerator was born in 2017. </p>\n<p id=\"Xgs89h\">This year, the group <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1516588&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41562-020-01007-2%3Futm_source%3Dfeedburner%26utm_medium%3Dfeed%26utm_campaign%3DFeed%253A%2Bnathumbehav%252Frss%252Fcurrent%2B%2528Nature%2BHuman%2BBehaviour%2529&amp;referrer=vox.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vox.com%2Fscience-and-health%2F22360363%2Freplication-crisis-psychological-science-accelerator\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">published its first major paper</a> on the snap judgments people make of others’ faces, and it has several other exciting large-scale projects in the works. Its early success suggests the accelerator could be a model for the future of psychology — if the scientists involved can sustain it. </p>\n<h3 id=\"mxVNzS\">The Psychological Science Accelerator, explained </h3>\n<p id=\"UO2CJ9\">For the past 10 years, psychology has been struggling through what’s called <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/21504366/science-replication-crisis-peer-review-statistics\">the “replication crisis.”</a> </p>\n<p id=\"8wEJbK\">In summary: About a decade ago, many scientists realized that their standard research methods were delivering them false, unreliable results. </p>\n<p id=\"kMN6a2\">When many famous and textbook psychological studies were retested with more rigorous methods, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/8/27/17761466/psychology-replication-crisis-nature-social-science\">many failed</a>. Other results simply looked less <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/6/6/17413000/marshmallow-test-replication-mischel-psychology\">impressive upon reinspection</a>. It’s possible around <a href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/349/6251/aac4716\">50 percent of the published psychological literature</a> fails upon retesting, but no one knows precisely the extent of the instability in the foundations of psychological science. The realization provoked a painful period of introspection, and revision.</p>\n<p id=\"94l9Z1\"><em>For more on the origins of the replication crisis, check out this week’s episode of </em>Unexplainable. </p>\n<div id=\"KNTNlT\"><iframe src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed-podcast/episode/2KMoTphItK5hsw59Ui7yYQ\" style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 232px;\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"></iframe></div>\n<p id=\"4YfFCR\"></p>\n<p id=\"mBwkxS\">Chartier’s idea for the accelerator was inspired by global, massive projects in physics, like CERN’s Large Hadron collider or the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2016/2/11/10966366/ligo-gravitational-waves-einstein\">LIGO gravitational wave observatory</a>. The accelerator is a global network of psychologists who work together on answering some of the field’s toughest questions, with methodological rigor. </p>\n<p id=\"uEtXYg\">There’s an old model for conducting psychological research: done in small labs, run by one big-name professor, probing the brains of American college undergrads. The incentives built into this model have favored publishing as many papers with positive results as possible (those that show statistically significant results, but not those that turned up bupkis) over rigorous inquiry. This old model has produced a mountain of scientific literature — <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/3/14/11219446/psychology-replication-crisis\">but a lot of it has failed upon closer inspection</a>. </p>\n<p id=\"42xKF2\">Under this structure, researchers had arguably too much freedom: freedom to report positive findings but keep negative findings in a file drawer; to stop conducting an experiment as soon as desired results were obtained; to make 100 predictions but only report the ones that panned out. That freedom led researchers — often unwittingly, and without malicious intent (a lot of the practices were to make best use of scant resources) — to flimsy results. </p>\n<p id=\"HvXjgU\">“Given that the vast majority of research and psychology is done in the individual lab model, we need other models to have a diversity of process and see how that affects and the quality of work that’s produced,” <a href=\"https://www.simine.com/\">Simine Vazire</a>, a personality psychologist at the University of Melbourne who is not involved in the accelerator, says. </p>\n<p id=\"G2JmD7\">Chartier dreamed of a distributed lab network, with researchers in outposts all around the world, who could work together, democratically, on choosing topics to study and recruiting a truly global, diverse participant pool to use in experiments. They’d preregister their study designs, meaning they promise to stick to a particular recipe in running and analyzing an experiment, which staves off the cherry-picking and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/7/31/16021654/p-values-statistical-significance-redefine-0005\">p-hacking</a> (a variety of practices to get data to yield a false positive)<a href=\"https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/sds/docs/loewenstein/MeasPrevalQuestTruthTelling.pdf\"> that was rampant</a> before the replication crisis became apparent.</p>\n<p id=\"IQl4nI\">They’d keep everything transparent and accessible, and foster a culture of accountability to produce rigorous, meaningful work. The payoff would be to deeply study human psychology on a global scale, and to see in which ways human psychology varies around the world, and which ways it does not. </p>\n<p id=\"DnErzD\">As soon as this idea crystallized in his mind, Chartier got to his computer and wrote up a <a href=\"https://christopherchartier.com/2017/08/26/building-a-cern-for-psychological-science/\">manifesto on his blog</a>, headlined “<a href=\"https://christopherchartier.com/2017/08/26/building-a-cern-for-psychological-science/\">Building a CERN for Psychological Science</a>.”</p>\n<p id=\"4TJyJd\">He then posted the piece to Twitter, and emails started pouring in. Researchers all around the world wanted to sign up.</p>\n<p id=\"HP56ME\">Researchers like <a href=\"https://www.hannahmoshontz.com/\">Hannah Moshontz</a>, a psychologist at the University of Wisconsin Madison, saw the post and immediately wanted to contribute. “I just jumped at the chance,” Moshontz says. “It just felt like this is the cutting edge, this is what we should be doing.”</p>\n<p id=\"iHnUDx\">Today, the <a href=\"https://psysciacc.org/\">Psychological Science Accelerator</a> is made up of over 500 laboratories, representing more than 1,000 researchers, in 70 countries around the world.</p>\n<p id=\"ZfzeLP\">They’ve all committed to remaining transparent, being rigorous, and making decisions about what to study. “They have, I think, a lot more accountability built into the process.” says Vazire.</p>\n<p id=\"9k5kyR\">Though accountability can sometimes lead to friction.</p>\n<h3 id=\"VWjEht\">The accelerator’s first challenge was testing an influential theory of how we judge faces around the world </h3>\n<p id=\"ByLFCS\">This past January, the Psychological Science Accelerator published its first major findings in the journal <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1516588&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41562-020-01007-2%3Futm_source%3Dfeedburner%26utm_medium%3Dfeed%26utm_campaign%3DFeed%253A%2Bnathumbehav%252Frss%252Fcurrent%2B%2528Nature%2BHuman%2BBehaviour%2529&amp;referrer=vox.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vox.com%2Fscience-and-health%2F22360363%2Freplication-crisis-psychological-science-accelerator\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Nature Human Behavior</em></a>. The study put the influential <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/105/32/11087\">theory for how we make snap</a> judgments of people’s faces to a huge international test. </p>\n<p id=\"6ZcnIz\">The theory is called the valence-dominance model, and it suggests we evaluate people’s faces on two broad dimensions — how dominant their face appears, and how generally negative or positive they seem. Most of the research done on this model has taken place in the US or Europe. So the accelerator simply wanted to know: Does this model explain how people all around the world judge the faces of others? </p>\n<p id=\"AuaZhC\">The final paper included more than 11,000 participants (huge for a psychology study) in 41 countries. And there are 241 co-authors listed on the paper. </p>\n<p id=\"YQ8O6C\">The results? Broadly speaking, this influential model replicates around the world. But the accelerator also included a new type of analysis of the data, which reveals some slight fissures. Outside of Western context, this analysis finds, “there may be a third dimension that emerges,” Chartier says, suggesting an interesting way people around the world might vary in how they perceive faces. “In other world regions, people just don’t really seem to have good agreement about who looks dominant,” Chartier says. It’s a wrinkle that wouldn’t have arisen if this collaboration had only been conducted in the United States or Europe. </p>\n<p id=\"x36ee6\">But this conclusion wasn’t reached without some tension.</p>\n<p id=\"b0qPz6\"><a href=\"https://www.chicagobooth.edu/faculty/directory/t/alexander-todorov\">Alexander Todorov</a>, the psychologist who originally <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/105/32/11087\">co-authored this model</a> of face perception in the 2000s, was brought on to advise and consult on the study design. Todorov originally signed off on the experimental design and analysis plan for the study, which was then preregistered, meaning the team was locking in their recipe for the experiment and couldn’t change it based on the results. </p>\n<p id=\"eiCPMx\">But after this study design was registered and the data started pouring in, Todorov started to think the recipe for the new, cutting-edge analysis needed to be tweaked. And the accelerator refused to change it. </p>\n<div class=\"c-float-right\"><div id=\"UJI8OI\"><div data-anthem-component=\"aside:9733921\"></div></div></div>\n<p id=\"cfniO3\">Todorov argues that the inflexibility of the preregistration — the plan is submitted to the journal before any data is collected — is problematic. “Imagine you’re a brain surgeon and you preregister all of the steps of your brain surgery,” Todorov says. “And then you started poking in the brain of your patients. And you said, Oops if I don’t do this, you’re going to kill him or her. Would you change the procedures?” In the end, the accelerator didn’t deviate from the plan. </p>\n<p id=\"zMVMOf\">The specifics of Todorov’s and the accelerator’s arguments about the data analysis here get technical. But there’s an important broader point this bit of friction makes clear. </p>\n<p id=\"IvTg23\">In the past, someone with Todorov’s standing would have had a lot of leeway to tweak an experimental analysis after data started to come in. But that sort of freedom to deviate from the experimental plan is part of why psychology fell into crisis. It’s too easy to make these small tweaks, and subtly (and not overtly intentionally) influence the results of a study to a desired outcome. Whether Todorov is right or wrong in this case about the analytic plan is beside this bigger point but shows how determined this new collaboration approach is.</p>\n<p id=\"B4wjHe\">Ultimately, Todorov is supportive of the accelerator and its mission. “I think it’s a great way forward,” he says of the group. “We did have some disagreements. But that’s okay.” There are a lot of strong elements to the projects, he notes, such as the transparency of the research. “Everybody can go and analyze the data and make a judgment for themselves.” </p>\n<p id=\"lqmCJw\">In the end, the paper published, but Chartier said it was an exhausting process. Not just in dealing with Todorov’s objections — coordinating hundreds of people is also tough work. </p>\n<h3 id=\"ptjm9y\">The accelerator’s plans for the future — and what could get in the way</h3>\n<p id=\"NU9Rcc\">So far, the accelerator has only published on the face perception research. But there are more projects in the works. </p>\n<p id=\"8v43PP\">In light of the pandemic, the participants have turned their global network to studying coping mechanisms during stressful times. For example, <a href=\"https://psysciacc.org/studies/psacr-1-2-3/\">one research effort</a> is testing out if a technique used to reduced stress and anxiety (called cognitive reappraisal) works around the world. </p>\n<p id=\"Oqi6rs\">Additionally, the group is looking into whether studies on how people answer the philosophical <a href=\"https://psysciacc.org/006-trolley-problem/\">“trolley problem” replicate</a> around the world, and how <a href=\"https://psysciacc.org/003-gendered-prejudice/\">gender prejudice rears its head globally</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"a4Qtn2\">Beyond individual studies and replications, the team also hopes to just generate lots of good, scientifically sound psychological data on people around the world, for other researchers to use as reference. </p>\n<p id=\"xXRSW8\">The slate of research projects is ambitious and promising, but it faces many challenges. The accelerator is potentially a model for the future, but it still has to operate in the existing status quo of academia,<a href=\"https://psysciacc.org/2021/01/11/how-should-we-fund-the-psa/\"> including very limited funding</a> and a lack of incentives from institutions for researchers — especially more junior faculty — to sign on to these large projects. </p>\n<p id=\"O6jMgr\">Under the current status quo, researchers get ahead and make progress in their careers by being the primary author on a big-idea study, not by being one of hundreds of authors playing a bit role in a huge project. </p>\n<p id=\"QXePMi\">Its members are also largely volunteers, and mostly from North America and Europe.</p>\n<p id=\"o6TaRR\">“We wanted it to be much more diverse, and we’re still struggling with that,” says<a href=\"https://www.usiu.ac.ke/423/brown-dana-basnight-phd/?schl=school-of-humanities-social-sciences\"> Dana Basnight Brown</a>, a cognitive psychologist at United States International University-Africa in Nairobi, Kenya. “We certainly do have members in South America. Southeast Asia has quite a vibrant community, and we have a lot of individuals from Indonesia, Philippines, Taiwan. But Africa, [there’s] very low representation.” </p>\n<h3 id=\"pcHrKy\">Why psychologists need to get psychology right </h3>\n<p id=\"2odeFU\">Despite the challenges, the work continues. The members of the Psychological Science Accelerator still believe in the value of psychological research, even though — and perhaps because — the recent history of the replication crisis is upsetting to them. </p>\n<p id=\"N0iQVF\">“Psychology matters, and getting it right matters, because this is the science of the human experience,” Chartier says. “If you can just marginally improve the way we collect and analyze our data and draw conclusions from them, there are untold future human beings that can benefit from that tiny advance.”</p>\n<p id=\"HNVCcB\">Good science is a gift we give to the future. Today, we have the gift of eclipse predictions from scientists from the past. We don’t yet know what specific gifts a more scientifically sound and globally equitable field of psychology could give us. But whatever they might be, they now have the potential to be durable and powerful for the entire world. </p>\n<p id=\"8ffgPv\"><em>Byrd Pinkerton contributed reporting. </em></p>\n<p id=\"AjxS3S\"></p>\n<p id=\"OP2KTp\"></p>\n<p id=\"rXInhh\"></p>\n<p id=\"15Tt0W\"></p>\n<p id=\"Aq2dyr\"></p>\n<p id=\"SfHUw5\"></p>\n<p id=\"PwsCrQ\"></p>\n\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 07 Apr 2021 15:50:00 +0000","feedId":99,"bgimg":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v_fL99_SwKcE30naI3Xa09sJbkg=/520x0:5520x3750/1310x983/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69089431/lede06_final_01.0.png","linkMd5":"3703c755cba9ada064221680d38ce26b","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn21@2020_6/2021/04/07/17-39-05-797_dea6c26a607c7d5d.webp","destWidth":1310,"destHeight":983,"sourceBytes":128146,"destBytes":64478,"author":"Brian Resnick","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v_fL99_SwKcE30naI3Xa09sJbkg=/520x0:5520x3750/1310x983/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69089431/lede06_final_01.0.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn21@2020_6/2021/04/07/17-39-05-797_dea6c26a607c7d5d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617817113010},{"createdTime":"2021-04-08 01:38:33","updatedTime":"2021-04-08 01:38:33","title":"All adults will be eligible for Covid-19 vaccine on April 19, Biden announces","link":"https://www.vox.com/22370323/biden-vaccine-eligibility-covid-adults-april-19","description":"  \n\n    <figure>\n      <img alt=\"President Biden Delivers Remarks On COVID-19 Response And State Of Vaccinations\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dKt0hVMD6dfMSlWF2LFIk7BznCc=/0x0:4905x3679/1310x983/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69086293/1232006926.0.jpg\" />\n        <figcaption>President Joe Biden announced on Tuesday that all American adults will be eligible for Covid-19 vaccination by April 19. | Drew Angerer/Getty Images</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n  <p>The change comes two weeks earlier than previously scheduled.</p> <p id=\"Neljhc\">President Joe Biden has <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/biden-move-vaccine-eligibility-date-april-19-021157c7bdf964181e3b63f51b89601e\">announced</a> that all adults will become eligible for a Covid-19 vaccine by April 19. The news came as confirmed coronavirus infections continue to rise throughout the US, intensifying pressure to quickly increase the number of vaccinated people to help counter the rise of more infectious coronavirus variants.</p>\n<p id=\"mjBHa1\">“Let me be deadly earnest with you,” Biden said Tuesday at the White House. “We aren’t at the finish line. We still have a lot of work to do. We’re still in a life-and-death race against this virus.”</p>\n<p id=\"bpm2jQ\">The new pledge marks a change in Biden’s previous goal to ensure that vaccinations would be available for 90 percent of US adults by April 19, and it’s possible to achieve given the recent increase in vaccinations across the country.</p>\n<p id=\"hB7PFA\">According to <a href=\"https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations\">CDC figures</a>, more than 108 million Americans — including about 40 percent of all adults and 75 percent of seniors (65 and up) — had received at least one dose as of Tuesday morning. Nearly 63 million people are fully vaccinated. Overall, the country’s vaccination rate is almost <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/coronavirus-pandemic-vaccine-updates-04-05-21/h_1baa33ff53fef851892d5335932e470f\">five times greater than the world average</a>, according to a CNN analysis, with over 3 million Americans receiving Covid-19 shots every day.</p>\n<div class=\"c-float-right\"><div id=\"Eu7Cpn\"><div data-anthem-component=\"aside:10296380\"></div></div></div>\n<p id=\"KrXKxD\">This rate positions the country to meet the administration’s goal of getting 200 million shots in arms by April 30, Biden’s 100th day in office. When the president announced that goal on March 25, <a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/100-million-covid19-vaccinations-reached.html\">100 million shots had been given in less than two months</a>. If doctors and nurses continue to administer at least 2.5 million shots per day — the seven-day average in late March — the administration would <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2021/3/25/22350718/biden-200-million-covid-19-vaccines-100-days-coronavirus\">reach its 200-million-shot goal with days to spare</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"rfWnXt\">The president’s pledge to open vaccinations to all adults is largely <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/biden-move-vaccine-eligibility-date-april-19-021157c7bdf964181e3b63f51b89601e\">a symbolic one</a>. All but one state, Hawaii, had already pledged to make vaccines available for all residents 18 and up either on or in advance of the new April 19 deadline. Most recently, <a href=\"https://www.statesmanjournal.com/story/news/2021/04/06/oregon-covid-19-vaccine-timeline-eligibility-governor-kate-brown/7104577002/\">Oregon Gov. Kate Brown announced Tuesday morning</a> that her state’s timeline would be moved up in accordance with the president’s.</p>\n<p id=\"qcM4UC\">But the announcement ensures that every state is held to the same vaccination rules as access opens up. And getting everyone vaccinated as quickly as possible is of growing importance: Covid-19 rates are rising in some parts of the country, particularly in the upper Midwest, and experts continue to warn of a new surge of Covid-19 infections fueled by the spread of variants and loosened restrictions in some states.</p>\n<h3 id=\"x7iJaN\">The US is facing an uptick in confirmed Covid-19 cases</h3>\n<p id=\"t9dQm3\">While increased vaccination rates and eligibility is undisputedly good news, both developments coincide with an uptick in Covid-19 cases that experts worry <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22358095/covid-19-fourth-surge-wave-rochelle-walensky-cdc-impending-doom\">may soon turn into a fourth wave</a>. On March 14, the country reported a weekly average of less than 53,000 cases per day. That number reached 76,594 cases on April 5, a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html\">20 percent increase from 14 days prior</a>. Deaths are down and hospitalizations remain stagnant, though those numbers typically lag case counts for several weeks before they reflect those increases.</p>\n<p id=\"dodG9K\">The uptick is believed to be fueled in part by the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/06/health/us-coronavirus-tuesday/index.html\">continued spread of variants</a> that are often more infectious, and sometimes more deadly, than the initial strain of the coronavirus. And part of what drives the national vaccine effort is a race to inoculate the country before additional new variants emerge. Experts are particularly worried about the rise of potential variants with an <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-japan-idUSKBN2BR03W\">Eek mutation</a>, which allows a virus to better evade immune responses from vaccines.</p>\n<p id=\"yMRb98\">According to Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, variants <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/coronavirus-pandemic-vaccine-updates-04-06-21/h_dbf68588e0a1be21a2573e18e7edea5f\">have been found in every US state</a>, although none have had the Eek mutation. Osterholm said on Sunday’s <em>Meet the Press</em> that the B.1.1.7 variant, one <a href=\"https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/03/death-rate-64-higher-b117-covid-variant-study-finds\">believed to be more infectious and deadly</a> and thought to have originated in the United Kingdom, “is almost like having a whole new pandemic descend upon us.” The good news: <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meet-press-april-04-2021-n1262993\">Vaccines seem to stop its spread</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"WeOIJf\">At the moment, scientists <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/transmission/variant.html\">don’t know how widely the new variants are circulating</a>. But as the weeks pass, they’ll likely constitute a higher share of US Covid-19 cases — and a key concern with the B.1.1.7 variant, according to Osterholm, is its impact on children.</p>\n<p id=\"sqWyZO\">“Unlike the previous strains of the virus, we didn’t see children under eighth grade get infected often, or they were not frequently very ill,” Osterholm said on <em>Meet the Press</em>. “They didn’t transmit to the rest of the community. That’s why I was one of those people very strongly supporting reopening in-class learning. B.1.1.7 turns that on its head.”</p>\n<p id=\"4LVV7f\">However, Anthony Fauci — the Biden administration’s chief medical adviser — has said the threat these variants pose, and the threat of a new wave of cases, can be minimized so long as vaccination rates continue to grow unabated.</p>\n<p id=\"ZjdunN\">“As long as we keep vaccinating people efficiently and effectively, I don’t think that’s gonna happen,” <a href=\"https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/dr-fauci-we-don-t-want-to-declare-victory-against-the-virus-prematurely-109717061662\">Fauci said on MSNBC on Tuesday</a>. “That doesn’t mean that we’re not going to still see increases in cases. Whether it explodes into a real surge or not remains to be seen. I think that the vaccine is going to prevent that from happening.”</p>\n\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 06 Apr 2021 22:00:40
