No edits have been made to the original piece and the dates represent what was current as of AugustÂ 2017.</em></p><p>The naturalization ceremony is one of the most exciting days of an immigrant journey. It represents the culmination of the years-long wait to become a U.S. citizen. After this dayâ€“for all intents and purposesâ€“the beneficiary is a new citizen of the United States of America. That is, <em>almost</em> all intents and purposes, besides obtaining a U.S. Passportâ€¦</p><h3><strong>A new citizen cannot be approved for a U.S. passport, until their citizenship case is closedâ€“a process that in the worst cases can takeÂ months.</strong></h3><p>Currently, this close out process requires immigration staff to upload some paperwork into each beneficiaryâ€™s case file, and manually update a database with the new citizen status. This database is queried by other federal agencies to validate citizenship when a new citizen applies for U.S. citizen benefits.</p><p>For the staff of USCIS District 23 in Southern California, it can take weeks to close every case in a single naturalization ceremony. District 23 covers the whole of Los Angeles County, San Bernardino, Orange County, and as far north as Santa Barbara County. A policy with the Central District of California Court means that there is only one day every month for beneficiaries from this district to take the oathâ€“meaning there is only one day every month that beneficiaries can become new citizens.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Edah9QLwGurENbL4-4nvTQ.jpeg\" /><figcaption>Before applicants take their seats, a USCIS staff member checks their N-445 questionnaire</figcaption></figure><p>These one-day-a-month ceremonies are absolutely massive, and if you didnâ€™t know it, you might think you were walking into a Lakerâ€™s game. At a District 23 naturalization ceremony in March of 2017, there were over 6,000 people becoming new citizens. A security supervisor informed us that this ceremony was small in comparison to others in the past. Over 10,000 people sometimes crowd into the L.A. Live Convention Center each month to recite the oath and become U.S. citizens.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*frXWJUvmYL9-VOrtzT3SpQ.jpeg\" /><figcaption>March 2017 Naturalization Ceremony, LA Convention Center</figcaption></figure><h3><strong>A naturalization case cannot be closed until the beneficiaryâ€™s N-445 is uploaded.</strong></h3><p>The N-445, or Notice to Appear for Oath Ceremony, is the document that each beneficiary receives which informs themâ€“among other thingsâ€“where and when to appear for their naturalization ceremony. On the second page, there are a set of yes/no questions that each beneficiary must answer on the day of the ceremony. These questions are meant to fill in the gap of time between the initial naturalization interview and the naturalization ceremony in case there have been any changes that would affect a beneficiary being considered for citizenship. For example: <em>â€œSince your interview, have you knowingly committed any crime or offense, for which you have not been arrested?â€� </em>The beneficiary must certify their answers by signing, and the document is collected by the ceremony check-in staff. It is mandatory that every beneficiary complete and submit this form in order to receive their Certificate of Naturalization.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*duui1miAWqmGa1-m1lq48Q.jpeg\" /></figure><p>Flash forwardâ€Šâ€”â€Špost-ceremony. All approved beneficiaries have received their Certificate of Naturalization. The clock is ticking for the staff of USCIS to close the cases. The N-445, this paper form the beneficiaries handed in, must be scanned and uploaded into each digital case file. While USCIS has made huge strides to make naturalization a wholly electronic process, functionality is developed iteratively and artifacts of the old paper process dot the digital landscape. However, this requires a robust system by which staff can upload and manage the digital version of a paper document.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*G_tHpTHnlHctiTb5lLvSIw.jpeg\" /><figcaption>An extremely over-simplified example of an ELIS naturalization journey and where paper-based segments must be recorded and uploaded.</figcaption></figure><p>In Los Angeles, a few unlucky USCIS officers own the task of scanning and uploading each N-445. Even more unfortunate for Jackie Tong, a Senior Immigration Services Officer from District 23, who scanned and uploaded 6,000 N-445 from the March 2017 ceremony.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/282/1*JhF-wHi1FUI71fxwahAC_g.gif\" /></figure><h4><strong>Current N-445 UploadÂ Process</strong></h4><ol><li>Jackie individually scans each N-445, a two page document.</li><li>Jackie saves each N-445 wherever and however she wishes on her computer. She mentions that some users create folders on their desktop, some name the files with the applicantâ€™s unique A-Number so they know which N-445 goes with which applicant. However, thereâ€™s no standardâ€Šâ€”â€Šitâ€™s all doneÂ ad-hoc.</li><li>Jackie opens the browser and navigates to the specific ceremony management page in the Electronic Immigration System (ELIS), where they can see a table of every applicant from that ceremony. Here she clicks the button â€œUpload N-445â€� next to each applicant.</li><li>Jackie uploads the document for that applicant by browsing for the file and selecting it from her desktop. We observed that it would take Jackie around 2â€“3 minutes to scan, name, save, pair, and upload a single N-445 document to a caseÂ file.</li><li>Jackie rinses and repeats 5,999 times. I leave after the firstÂ ten.</li></ol><h3>OK, letâ€™s fixÂ thisâ€¦</h3><h4>1. <strong>How might we allow a user to scan directly into ELIS through theÂ browser?</strong></h4><p>To address this problem, we used the Dynamic Web TWAIN document scanning SDK. This software plugin allows immigration officers to scan documents directly into the electronic case file through the browser. This SDK allows users to combine the steps of scanning, naming, and uploading into a single action. Within ELIS, the Immigration Officers can now simply click the â€œScan Documentâ€� button which brings up an interface that allows them to scan any file and save it to the case file. This capability now benefits all users who have to digitize paper files and upload into case files. However, this only makes it easier to upload each individual N-445 file. We needed to find a way to automatically file each document after scanning hundreds atÂ once.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*wDd_Wk7vnSLwGVSFgjDNNA.gif\" /><figcaption>Scanning directly into ELIS with TWAINÂ (GIF)</figcaption></figure><h4>2. How might we configure the system to do the work of filing each individual N-445 if a user batch scans multipleÂ files?</h4><p>Where N-445 is concerned, batch or bulk is the name of the game. This repetitive task never varies so we developed a microservice that accepts a batch PDF file, separates each individual N-445, and files it under the correct applicantâ€™s case file. The applicantâ€™s unique case number is encoded in a 2-d barcode that the microservice can parse and attach the single-page PDF file to the right applicant.</p><p>The quintessential idea was that the barcode would be printed on the N-445 before being mailed out. However no single team is given carte-blanche to update the N-445 printing schema to include the 2-d barcode. This infinitesimal task requires collaboration from multiple, fragmented development teams.</p><p>In the interimâ€“to circumnavigate bureaucracyâ€“we devised a solution requiring one development team which involved Avery mailing labels being generated for all applicants in a naturalization ceremony. Staff would then affix the label to the N-445. From here the solution works the same as above: the officer loads a stack of N-445 documents into a scanner, clicks the â€œBatch Scan N445â€� button in ELIS, and the system parses the labels just as if they were printed on theÂ N-445.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*IxkKbcKzVvR0-K1IHciuvg.jpeg\" /><figcaption>The QR-code only contains a beneficiaryâ€™s case number, the name and A# are for sticking-to-correct-document validation</figcaption></figure><p>This first iteration allowed us to expeditiously beta test with specific offices, conduct usability tests (yeah, sticking on 6,000 labels is a problem), and fix bugs. User validation also uncovered other uses for the 2-d barcode such as ceremony check-in procedures that can use the 2-d barcode in the same way that TSA staff scan a boarding pass at anÂ airport.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/480/1*hhoIR1BlNh0uYDiXSFEQpg.gif\" /><figcaption>Eagerly explaining the initial idea to the engineers.</figcaption></figure><h4>New N-445 UploadÂ Process</h4><ol><li>The user opens the browser and navigates to the specific ceremony management page inÂ ELIS.</li><li>The user loads a stack of around 50â€“75 N-445 notices into the feeder tray of theirÂ scanner.</li><li>The user clicks the â€œBatch Scan N-445â€� Button.Â Success.</li><li>The user rinses and repeats around 79â€“119Â times</li></ol><p>While still repetitive, users in District 23 no longer need to spend ~300 total hours to upload 6,000 N-445 files. Now they can complete this same volume in ~7 totalÂ hours.</p><h3>What once took one month, now takes oneÂ day.</h3><p>To provide better digital services for the American people means to also assist the public servants who toil in the backgroundâ€“<em>often silently</em>â€“with outdated and inefficient legacy systems. In USCIS offices around the country, the U.S. Digital Service has met and spoken with these government usersâ€“a flexible group of dedicated immigration officers who adapt to just about any new process, system, or policy. Improving internal case processing is directly linked to improving the wait time and reduces stress that a beneficiary could experience.</p><blockquote>â€œWe really want ELIS to work. Weâ€™re rooting for it because our work, and peopleâ€™s lives really depend on it. Thereâ€™s no otherÂ option.â€�</blockquote><blockquote>â€” Immigration Officer, Honolulu FieldÂ Office</blockquote><p>Visiting real usersâ€“observing how they workâ€“solving problemsâ€“delivering solutionsâ€“and validating with users. This isnâ€™t avant-garde, but it is rather new for government agencies. We believe we are showing this is actually possible at USCIS, and we truly believe that if this is possible at USCIS, itâ€™s possible anywhere in the government. There is still so much work to do. The best way we know how to do this is to keep solving problems, so weâ€™re going back toÂ work.</p><img
