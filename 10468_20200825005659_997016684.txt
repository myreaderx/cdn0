Overnight, lots of us have found ourselves with three full-time jobs: parent, teacher, and the job we���re paid to do. I���ll be honest, I���ve found it overwhelming ��� and as I write this, my daughter is under my desk, howling that she���s bored.</p>\n<p>I���m very fortunate to be surrounded by colleagues in the same position, and some have been juggling childcare, homeschooling, and work for a while. So I reached out and asked for help. Here���s what I���ve learned. I hope it will help you too.</p>\n<h2 id=\"accept-that-you-cant-work-at-full-capacity\">Accept that you can���t work at full capacity</h2>\n<p>One message came through loud and clear: you are one person, and it���s simply impossible to do three full-time jobs. Even if you���re managing between two people, that���s an awful lot to ask. And, with everything that���s going on at the moment, it���s completely understandable that you���re distracted too.</p>\n<p>Be honest with yourself and your boss. Ask whether it���s possible to work flexible hours, or to focus on less concentration-intensive tasks or projects. We���re slowing down here so that folks can manage their workloads around other commitments and put their families and <a href=\"https://blog.1password.com/remote-work-mental-health/\">mental health first</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"remember-kids-dont-get-7-hours-of-teaching-a-day-at-school\">Remember: kids don���t get 7 hours of teaching a day at school</h2>\n<p>When it comes to homeschooling, I���m just going to hand over to Sara, one of our founders. She keeps 1Password running while homeschooling her kids, so as far as I���m concerned, she&rsquo;s the source of truth on the matter.</p>\n<p>She reassured me: ���With homeschooling, the biggest panic right now is this idea that kids spend a good seven hours at school learning, and they need proper lessons. Nope! They spend a lot of time just waiting to have their turn, washing hands, going outside, doing all kinds of things.���</p>\n<p>���Really, learning time is maybe an hour or two a day. Knowing that makes it easier to remember that TV isn���t always bad ��� teachers use it too when kids are noisy. Having a favourite show ready when you���re about to have a call is a great tool! Magic School Bus, Dora, Cosmos&hellip; whatever floats your kids��� boat.���</p>\n<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Learning doesn���t always mean conventional schoolwork. Encourage kids to go looking for bugs outside, make busses out of cereal boxes, or build a castle out of Lego. It gets them out of your hair and means they���re learning things they might not at school.</p>\n<h2 id=\"have-a-schedule-but-be-flexible\">Have a schedule but be flexible</h2>\n<p>Lots of parents here swear by having a schedule for the day. It gives kids a bit of structure, and helps you plan in time to focus.</p>\n<p>Here���s a daily schedule that Megs, who works on our design team, shared with me:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>6 a.m.</strong> Wake up and have breakfast (both parents)</li>\n<li><strong>7���11 a.m.</strong> Parent A works, parent B plays</li>\n<li><strong>11 a.m.���12 p.m.</strong> Lunch and naptime (both parents there to cook and yell at small ones to lie down)</li>\n<li><strong>1���4 p.m.</strong> Parent B works, parent A cleans and does extra work (if naptime happens) and plays</li>\n<li><strong>4 p.m.</strong> Educational TV or chilled play while one parent cooks</li>\n</ul>\n<p>���Splitting responsibility has always been important in our home, and now with the kids home full time, it���s become a crucial tool to help us maintain our sanity.</p>\n<p>Our kids are 3 and 1, and demand a lot of attention. My partner and I are each working half a day and parenting for the other half. We&rsquo;re so lucky that our jobs have been flexible and understanding of our needs, and it&rsquo;s been really great to be able to tag-team parenting this way.���</p>\n<p>I���m on my own with my daughter for most of the day, so swapping in and out isn���t an option. Even so, I have found that putting together a rough outline of her day helps move her from one activity to the next. Admittedly, nine times out of ten, it goes completely out of the window, but having a few activities lined up means I can throw something new at her when she gets bored. Even if that���s just an educational video or box of art supplies.</p>\n<h2 id=\"make-the-most-of-technology\">Make the most of technology</h2>\n<p>How much children should use technology, and what they should use it for, can be a prickly topic for parents. But, if you���re comfortable with it, now is the time to embrace the educational value of technology. Don���t be afraid to lean on TV, iPads, and trusted streaming services if you need to. This is an unprecedented situation, and if technology allows you to be productive while your kid is learning, then as far as I���m concerned it���s a win-win.</p>\n<p>Coding apps like <a href=\"https://www.scratchjr.org/\">ScratchJnr</a> and <a href=\"https://www.tynker.com/\">Tynker</a> teach kids invaluable skills (ScratchJnr is used in schools), and can keep them occupied while you take a call. Our ���school days��� have meant morning exercise with Joe Wicks <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz0go1pTda8&amp;list=PLyCLoPd4VxBvQafyve889qVcPxYEjdSTl\">live on YouTube</a>, learning a language with <a href=\"https://tinycards.duolingo.com/\">DuoLingo</a>, and listening to <a href=\"https://www.worldofdavidwalliams.com/elevenses/\">David Walliams audiobooks</a> (they���re free for the next month).</p>\n<p><strong>Tip:</strong> If your child has lessons or activities outside of school, check whether your provider is offering a virtual alternative. My daughter is taking her usual ukulele and Karate lessons every week by video call. I can���t wait to hear what 10 five-year-olds playing the ukulele over video chat sounds like.</p>\n<h2 id=\"youre-not-alone\">You���re not alone</h2>\n<p>Don���t worry if you need to jump off a call because your kid needs you, or if they make a quick cameo during the morning standup. Your colleagues will understand, and most folks tell me they love that small insight into each other&rsquo;s lives.</p>\n<p>Talk to your colleagues about your kids and share your funny stories. They do want to listen, and we���ve found that other team members are keen to help by working around parents��� schedules or by shuffling tasks around.</p>\n<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Will, our Design &amp; Web Lead, suggests trying a closed-door policy. ���When the door is closed, it means I&rsquo;m on a call and that the kids should be quiet and not come in. It took some time to get working, but it now works great. Once, during an interview, I had to go to the basement as my kids were being loud and my wife was ill ��� I nearly got away with it too until someone flushed the toilet and the water pipe was right next to me.���</p>\n<p>Often, it���s these human moments that help build lasting connections with our colleagues.</p>\n<h2 id=\"embrace-the-interruptions\">Embrace the interruptions</h2>\n<p>Once you���ve accepted that interruptions will happen, you might find they become a source of joy, rather than stress. Stop and listen to your child���s explanation of the space cafe they���ve just built in your living room, watch the dance routine they���ve just made up, and talk to them about their day. This is all pretty weird for them too, and you���ll enjoy moments you might usually miss out on while they&rsquo;re at school.</p>\n<p>Lynette, who works in Customer Success, put it beautifully: ���The best part is being able to watch my daughter learn, and spending so much time with her. She watches these videos about singing and dancing, and sometimes her mood completely changes. I just hear her singing along. Also, I love getting hugs throughout the day. I&rsquo;ll be in a meeting and she&rsquo;ll just come up and hug me, and go back to what she was doing. It&rsquo;s the best.���</p>\n<h2 id=\"above-all-be-kind-to-yourself\">Above all, be kind to yourself</h2>\n<p>This situation is new to all of us. Things won���t go as planned every day, or maybe ever. And that���s okay ��� we���re all doing our best. Learn and adjust as you go, and when it all goes out of the window (which it will), try to laugh about it. Embrace the absurdity of it, and share the joy and the humour with your colleagues ��� we could all use a lift right now.</p>\n<section class=\"c-call-to-action-box c-call-to-action-box--background-author\">\n<div class=\"c-call-to-action-box__author\">\n<img src=\"https://blog.1password.com/img/authors/emilymarchant.png\" class=\"c-call-to-action-box__author-image\" alt=\"Emily Marchant\"/>\n</div>\n<div class=\"c-call-to-action-box__content\">\n<h3 class=\"c-call-to-action-box__title\">Get more security tips</h3>\n<div class=\"c-call-to-action-box__text\">\nSign up to our business security mailing list and get advice on running a secure, productive workplace delivered directly to your inbox.\n</div>\n<form accept-charset=\"UTF-8\" action=\"https://agilemail.createsend.com/t/r/s/ohlyduj/\" class=\"oneline\" data-event-category=\"Newsletter\" data-event-action=\"form-newsletter\" id=\"newsletterForm\" method=\"post\">\n<div id=\"hidden-fields\"><input name=\"utf8\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"���\"><input name=\"authenticity_token\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"B2cHFMPBG0KjOnROQ884zCYcI0afwrAx897/qCCfum0=\"></div>\n<input class=\"c-call-to-action-box__newsletter-email\" id=\"cm-ohlyduj-ohlyduj\" name=\"cm-ohlyduj-ohlyduj\" type=\"email\" placeholder=\"wendy@appleseed.com\">\n<input class=\"c-call-to-action-box__newsletter-button\" type=\"submit\" value=\"Sign up\">\n</form>\n</div>\n</section>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Mon, 30 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":10468,"bgimg":"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2020/wfh-with-kids/header.png","linkMd5":"576b9aa6e366c0f97d00be4db113d4c0","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn78@2020_1/2020/08/25/00-54-54-324_9316c5c586aca1bc.webp","destWidth":2080,"destHeight":800,"sourceBytes":45674,"destBytes":49452,"author":"Emily Marchant","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2020/wfh-with-kids/header.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn78@2020_1/2020/08/25/00-54-54-324_9316c5c586aca1bc.webp","https://blog.1password.com/img/authors/emilymarchant.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn7@2020_1/2020/08/25/00-55-02-595_7b7ff396d27aba56.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598316891414},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:54:51","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:54:51","title":"Scams, malware, and preventative measures: advice from Michael Sherwood","link":"https://blog.1password.com/scams-malware-preventative-measures/","description":"\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/businesswebinar-scams-malware/header.png' class='webfeedsFeaturedVisual' alt='Scams, malware, and preventative measures: advice from Michael Sherwood' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p class=\"introduction\">The second webinar in our <a href=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/playlist?list=PLeXQRfNcE6-DKEwaj6hWes8ZU1iAQtp0v\">Essentials of Business Security series</a> is now available! In this video, Matt talks with Michael Sherwood from Malwarebytes about scams, malware, and what you can do to protect your business.</p>\n<div class=\"embed embed-16x9\">\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fIOCCAST_oI\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe><br>\n</div>\n<p>Michael���s journey to Malwarebytes began with an interest in technology and an Apple IIc in ���84. From there, he joined the US military, where in the mid-90s (the Windows NT era) he found his feet in cryptography. Today, he is VP of Enterprise Online at Malwarebytes, and we���re thrilled that he���s bringing his expert insight to our latest webinar.</p>\n<p>To help keep your business safe from scams and malware, we���ve put together five key points from our chat for you to take away and consider.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-landscape-is-shifting\">The landscape is shifting</h2>\n<p>Michael highlights that in the past ransomware has been mostly an annoyance, rather than malicious. However, the focus has shifted: attacks have become more advanced, and it&rsquo;s all about making money.</p>\n<p>The good news is that cybersecurity solutions <a href=\"https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/threat-landscape/smarter-phishing-techniques-cybersecurity-tools-advanced\">are keeping up</a> and getting better at detecting scams, fraud, and phishing attempts.</p>\n<h2 id=\"everyone-is-at-risk\">Everyone is at risk</h2>\n<p>Cyber breaches and scams are on the rise. A <a href=\"https://www.hiscox.com/cybersecurity\">recent global survey</a> indicates that more than 60% of organizations were affected by a security event in the last year.</p>\n<p>Use of ransomware is no longer only focused on attacking major organizations and corporations ��� it&rsquo;s just as likely to hit a small business or independent shop.</p>\n<p>If a few small shops pay up, attackers will likely widen their net and send ransomware to as many similar businesses as possible. The larger the audience, the higher the chances are that someone will fall for their scam.</p>\n<p>The Federal Trade Commission has put out a helpful <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/scams-your-small-business-guide-business\">guide for small businesses</a> on what to look out for to avoid getting scammed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"a-c-in-your-job-title-ups-your-risk\">A ���C��� in your job title ups your risk</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://info.phishlabs.com/blog/targeting-brand-c-suite-risk\">Owners, executives, and C-suite level employees</a> hold the keys to the business, making them a hot target for scammers and phishers. Matt notes that when he moved to a C-level position, the number of scam and <a href=\"https://blog.1password.com/what-is-phishing-and-how-can-you-protect-yourself/\">phishing emails</a> increased.</p>\n<p>Scammers may pose as a coworker or a colleague to bypass your defenses, in the hope that they���ll be able to trick you into giving up your credentials.</p>\n<h2 id=\"implement-the-basics\">Implement the basics</h2>\n<p>Having the right security software in place is your best defense. At a minimum, you should install <a href=\"https://www.business.com/categories/best-antivirus-and-internet-security/\">anti-virus and anti-malware</a> software on all employee machines.</p>\n<p>Additionally, research the right <a href=\"https://1password.com/password-manager/\">password manager</a>, two-factor authentication, and email services for your business. Consider hiring an IT professional to lead your security efforts too.</p>\n<h2 id=\"educate-your-team\">Educate your team</h2>\n<p>After the tools are in place, your employees need to know how to use them. Humans can be a weak link in your security chain, but the right training increases their strength. Educating your team on security basics, best practices, and how to stop phishing attempts is one of the best investments you can make.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isaca.org/Journal/archives/2010/Volume-1/Pages/Performing-a-Security-Risk-Assessment1.aspx\">Annual security assessments</a> and <a href=\"https://www.imperva.com/learn/application-security/penetration-testing/\">pen testing</a> help you to find knowledge gaps and weaknesses in your system. From there, you can create a comprehensive training plan.</p>\n<p>Malwarebytes also has a <a href=\"https://blog.malwarebytes.com/\">security blog</a> that highlights important events in the security world. They focus on thought leadership and take the time to break down how and why breaches happen, and what you should do if you&rsquo;re affected.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whats-up-next\">What&rsquo;s up next</h2>\n<p>If you enjoyed this chat with Michael, <a href=\"https://1password.com/webinars/\">sign up</a> to find out about our upcoming webinars.

There was multi-user support on tvOS and HomePod, game-changing security announcements like <strong>Sign In with Apple</strong>, iPad officially branching off from iPhone with iPadOS, Project Catalyst, and that oh-so-incredible Mac Pro. We also got something I���ve been anticipating for quite some time: Dark Mode for iOS.</p>\n<h2 class=\"neon-blue\">Challenge accepted</h2>\n<p>Each year we watch the WWDC keynote with bated breath, waiting for the announcement that will dictate our workload for the next 3 months.

Scammers and crooks like to take advantage of this, so here are some tips for staying safe and merry over the holidays.</p>\n<h2 id=\"no-holiday-promo-is-worth-risking-your-security\">No holiday promo is worth risking your security</h2>\n<p>The holiday season brings a drastic increase in emails. Phishing scams are a favorite of cybercriminals, and the lasting popularity of online shopping has made email phishing even more effective. Be wary of emails with attachments like fake receipts or invoices. These files can expose your computer and account to malware, keyloggers, and ransomware when you open the attachment.</p>\n<p>Malicious links like false purchase verifications or shipping notifications offer prime opportunities for hackers to steal your login credentials. And if you���ve <a href=\"https://blog.1password.com/how-to-protect-yourself-from-password-reuse-attacks/\">reused those login credentials on multiple sites</a>, your other accounts may be vulnerable.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/safer-holiday-tips/online-shopping.png' alt='Online Shopping' title='Online Shopping' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<h2 id=\"secure-your-wallet-when-shopping\">Secure your wallet when shopping</h2>\n<p>Online shopping saves time during the busy holiday season. But the <a href=\"https://blog.1password.com/using-1password-for-safer-online-shopping/\">price for this convenience could be increased risk</a>. It may be tempting to save your credit card information on a site for easy access, but not all websites are created equal when it comes to security.</p>\n<p>Use 1Password to securely store everything you need to make a purchase, from the expiration date to the CCV number on the back of the card. When it&rsquo;s time to check out, it only takes one click to fill everything you need. 1Password also protects you by checking the url before suggesting items to autofill. If the item you���re expecting to see isn���t suggested, double-check the url to make sure you haven���t been sent to Amaz0n.com instead of Amazon.com.</p>\n<p>The best way to stay safe is to use a unique password for every site. After all, the more often a password is reused, the more likely it is to be compromised or stolen. Use Watchtower to check for weak or reused passwords, then use the <a href=\"https://support.1password.com/change-website-password/\">strong password generator</a> to replace them with strong, unique ones.</p>\n<h2 id=\"keep-your-family-safe-and-connected\">Keep your family safe and connected</h2>\n<p>The holidays can be hectic, and you may need your partner&rsquo;s credit card details to buy a last-minute gift. Or you need to know which flight your grandparents are on so you can meet them at the airport. And if you&rsquo;re the one traveling, you may need your parents&rsquo; new Wi-Fi password to survive the week.</p>\n<p>Help your family practice smart online security and share passwords securely with a <a href=\"https://1password.com/families/\">1Password Families account</a>. With a shared vault, you can quickly and safely share passwords for things like Netflix, bank accounts, Wi-Fi routers, and more. This holiday season, give your loved ones the tools they need to stay safe online without taking away their independence.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/safer-holiday-tips/safe-travel.png' alt='Stay safe while traveling' title='Stay safe while traveling' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<h2 id=\"get-organized-before-you-hit-the-road\">Get organized before you hit the road</h2>\n<p>Whether you&rsquo;re <a href=\"https://blog.1password.com/how-to-protect-your-digital-life-when-you-travel/\">traveling to visit family or just escaping the snow this holiday season</a>, the contents of your devices need just as much protection as the items in your suitcase.\nWhen planning for a trip, take the time to <a href=\"https://blog.1password.com/storing-1password/\">store any critical information</a> you&rsquo;ll need in 1Password. You can save details like emergency contact information for your airline, the code for your hotel safe, travel insurance details, and even copies of your passport.</p>\n<p>Before you head to the airport, <a href=\"https://blog.1password.com/protect-your-data-when-crossing-borders-with-1password\">turn on Travel Mode for your 1Password account</a>.

It makes it more readable, more enjoyable, and more fun than ever before. Read on to find out how we did it and how you can add it to your own website.</p>\n<p>Dark Mode in Mojave is great for apps, but until now websites didn&rsquo;t have a way to participate in the fun. Apple just gave us a gift with their latest update to Safari Technology Preview, and we&rsquo;ve been having fun exploring the new possibilities.</p>\n<h2 id=\"welcome-to-the-dark-side-\">Welcome to the dark side ����</h2>\n<p>Today I���m happy to say that the 1Password blog is now 100% compatible with Dark Mode, and the experience is fantastic. ����</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/dark-mode/light-dark.gif' alt='1Password Blog supports Dark Mode' title='1Password Blog supports Dark Mode' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>Although the Safari app itself has supported Dark Mode ever since macOS Mojave debuted, websites had no way to know when their content was being presented in Dark Mode. You saw the same color scheme on each website, no matter which mode your Mac was in.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://webkit.org/blog/8475/release-notes-for-safari-technology-preview-68/\">Safari Technology Preview 68</a> changed this by adding support for the <code>prefers-color-scheme</code> media query. It&rsquo;s exactly what websites need to support Dark Mode. Images appear brighter and more vivid, and reading one of <a href=\"https://blog.1password.com/toward-better-master-passwords/\">Jeff Goldberg���s security lessons</a> is easier on the eyes by far. ����</p>\n<p>Right now, Dark Mode is only available on macOS Mojave, but because the media query is part of WebKit, we&rsquo;re hopeful that it will come to other platforms in time. To check it out yourself, install <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/safari/download/\">Safari Technology Preview</a>, or just sit tight. This new feature will be available in Safari proper sometime soon. If you do install Safari Technology Preview, switch to Dark Mode while viewing this blog post for an extra visual treat.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/dark-mode/switcher.png' alt='1Password Blog supports Dark Mode' title='1Password Blog supports Dark Mode' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<h2 id=\"add-support-for-dark-mode-to-your-site\">Add support for Dark Mode to your site</h2>\n<p>Although Apple gives you the basic information you need to add support for Dark Mode to your site, it���s not a complete picture. So we wanted to share how we did it. Feel free to use any of the code snippets below.</p>\n<p>At a basic level, Dark Mode can be accessed through a CSS media query:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-css\" data-lang=\"css\"><span class=\"p\">@</span><span class=\"k\">media</span> <span class=\"nt\">screen</span> <span class=\"nt\">and</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"nt\">prefers-color-scheme</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"nt\">dark</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{}</span>\n</code></pre></div><p>We then decided to convert this into a <a href=\"https://sass-lang.com/guide#topic-6\">Sass mixin</a> to make things a little neater:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-scss\" data-lang=\"scss\"><span class=\"k\">@mixin</span><span class=\"nf\"> dark-mode</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">$background</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">null</span><span class=\"o\">,</span> <span class=\"nv\">$color</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">null</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n<span class=\"k\">@media</span> <span class=\"n\">screen</span> <span class=\"ow\">and</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">prefers-color-scheme</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">dark</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n<span class=\"k\">@if</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">$background</span> <span class=\"o\">!=</span> <span class=\"n\">null</span> <span class=\"ow\">and</span> <span class=\"nv\">$color</span> <span class=\"o\">!=</span> <span class=\"n\">null</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n<span class=\"nt\">background-color</span><span class=\"nd\">:</span> <span class=\"err\">$</span><span class=\"nt\">background</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"nt\">color</span><span class=\"nd\">:</span> <span class=\"err\">$</span><span class=\"nt\">color</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n<span class=\"k\">@else</span> <span class=\"nt\">if</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"err\">$</span><span class=\"nt\">background</span> <span class=\"o\">!=</span> <span class=\"nt\">null</span> <span class=\"nt\">and</span> <span class=\"err\">$</span><span class=\"nt\">color</span> <span class=\"o\">==</span> <span class=\"nt\">null</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n<span class=\"nt\">background-color</span><span class=\"nd\">:</span> <span class=\"err\">$</span><span class=\"nt\">background</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n<span class=\"k\">@else</span> <span class=\"nt\">if</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"err\">$</span><span class=\"nt\">color</span> <span class=\"o\">!=</span> <span class=\"nt\">null</span> <span class=\"nt\">and</span> <span class=\"err\">$</span><span class=\"nt\">background</span> <span class=\"o\">==</span> <span class=\"nt\">null</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n<span class=\"nt\">color</span><span class=\"nd\">:</span> <span class=\"err\">$</span><span class=\"nt\">color</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n<span class=\"k\">@else</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n<span class=\"k\">@content</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div><p>Because we were mainly changing background color and font color, we thought it made sense to have these as variables to pass in on a single line to the mixin. This works in an &ldquo;and/or&rdquo; manner, but it also works if neither are passed in. This allows us to set any CSS properties we need to. The different ways to call the mixin are like so:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-scss\" data-lang=\"scss\"><span class=\"k\">@include</span><span class=\"nd\"> dark-mode</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">$background</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"mh\">#000</span><span class=\"o\">,</span> <span class=\"nv\">$color</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"mh\">#fff</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n<span class=\"k\">@include</span><span class=\"nd\"> dark-mode</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">$color</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"mh\">#fff</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n<span class=\"k\">@include</span><span class=\"nd\"> dark-mode</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">$background</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"mh\">#000</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n<span class=\"k\">@include</span><span class=\"nd\"> dark-mode</span><span class=\"p\">()</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n<span class=\"nt\">background-color</span><span class=\"nd\">:</span> <span class=\"nn\">#000</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"nt\">opacity</span><span class=\"nd\">:</span> <span class=\"nt\">0</span><span class=\"nc\">.5</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"nt\">border</span><span class=\"nd\">:</span> <span class=\"nt\">1px</span> <span class=\"nt\">solid</span> <span class=\"nn\">#fff</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div><p>We&rsquo;d love to hear from you to find out if the above was helpful to you.

Here���s why.</p>\n<p>Apple has always been at the forefront of the fight to protect your privacy, and the WebKit team that builds the foundation of Safari is no exception. In 2017, they introduced Intelligent Tracking Prevention, which helps prevent advertisers from tracking you when you use Safari. This was great news for privacy, and a lot of us at 1Password use Safari because of its strong commitment to privacy.</p>\n<p>Starting in Safari 13.1 for Mac and iOS 13.4, there are <a href=\"https://webkit.org/blog/10218/full-third-party-cookie-blocking-and-more/\">some additional changes to Intelligent Tracking Prevention</a>. Information a website stores in local storage will now be erased if you don&rsquo;t visit that website at least once every 7 days. This affects full-featured web apps like 1Password that use local storage for legitimate purposes. For example, 1Password stores your Secret Key in local storage. If your Secret Key is removed from Safari and you don&rsquo;t have it stored anywhere else, you won&rsquo;t be able to access your account.</p>\n<h2 id=\"more-steps-you-can-take\">More steps you can take</h2>\n<p>When you set up the 1Password apps, your Secret Key will be saved in the apps. So if it gets removed from Safari, you&rsquo;ll still be able to access your account. It&rsquo;s an important first step, but there&rsquo;s more you can do to protect your account. To make sure you always have access to 1Password:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Sign in on all your devices.</strong> Your Secret Key is stored on devices you&rsquo;ve used to sign in to your account. When you sign in on all your devices, each one can be used to <a href=\"https://support.1password.com/secret-key/\">find your Secret Key</a> when you need it.</li>\n<li><strong>Save your Emergency Kit.</strong> Your <a href=\"https://support.1password.com/emergency-kit/\">Emergency Kit</a> is a PDF document with your account details, including your Secret Key.

OneLogin is a leader in identity and access management (IAM), and this collaboration is something our customers have been requesting for quite some time.</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>“We are excited to partner with 1Password by creating a powerful integration for our joint customers that significantly reduces the work required to onboard new employees through our automated user provisioning” <strong>��� Matt Hurly VP Global Channels and Strategic Alliances &amp; GM Asia Pacific</strong></p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Together, <a href=\"https://www.onelogin.com/\">OneLogin</a> and <a href=\"https://1password.com/\">1Password</a> give you the controls you need to make sure everyone in your company follows your password and security policies. Here���s how it works.</p> \n<h2 id=\"seamless-integration-with-your-workflow\">Seamless integration with your workflow</h2> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://blog.1password.com/scim-bridge-release/\">1Password SCIM bridge</a> gives you the ability to strengthen your identity strategy and manage your teams by folding 1Password into your already-established workflows.</p> \n<p>Now, with <a href=\"https://www.onelogin.com/partners/technology-partners/1password\">OneLogin integration</a> you have full control over the 1Password deployment process. You can create, update, and deprovision employee accounts in real time and easily set and enforce company-wide security policies, all from a central location.</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>We���ve been waiting for the release of this integration to link 1Password with OneLogin seamlessly. This will automate user management and strengthen our security posture at BlaBlaCar by enabling all employees to secure their passwords. Now that it���s finally here, we can easily provision, deprovision, and manage groups and vaults through our identity provider.��� <strong>��� Andrews Delices, Head of IT, BlaBlaCar</strong></p> \n</blockquote> \n<h2 id=\"always-in-control\">Always in control</h2> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://support.1password.com/scim/\">SCIM bridge</a> delivers the high level of security and encryption that you expect from 1Password. OneLogin acts as a virtual directory in the cloud, synchronizing employees across all your directories, including Active Directory (AD), LDAP, Google Apps directory, OneLogin cloud directory, and HR directories.</p> \n<p>This self-hosted 1Password service is deployable with a single click from multiple cloud providers, or it can be easily integrated into your existing infrastructure. The SCIM bridge connects to your identity provider using the industry-standard protocol to facilitate the connection between OneLogin and 1Password. And, because the SCIM bridge runs within a system under your control, your account encryption keys also stay with you ��� right where they belong.</p> \n<h2 id=\"enforce-your-security-policies\">Enforce your security policies</h2> \n<p>Rolling out 1Password using the SCIM bridge makes it easy to automate and enforce all your existing access, password, and security policies. You can even strengthen security further by using the SCIM bridge with <a href=\"https://1password.com/business/advanced-protection\">1Password Advanced Protection</a> to set Master Password requirements, create firewall rules, require up-to-date apps, and monitor sign-in attempts. Everything is in one place, making administration a breeze.</p> \n<p>Visit our <a href=\"https://support.1password.com/scim-onelogin/\">get started guide</a> to learn how to set up and use the 1Password SCIM bridge to integrate with OneLogin.</p> \n<section class=\"c-call-to-action-box c-call-to-action-box--background-author\"> \n <div class=\"c-call-to-action-box__author\"> \n  <img src=\"https://blog.1password.com/img/authors/jeffshiner.jpg\" class=\"c-call-to-action-box__author-image\" alt=\"Jeff Shiner\" /> \n </div> \n <div class=\"c-call-to-action-box__content\"> \n  <h3 class=\"c-call-to-action-box__title\">Get started</h3> \n  <div class=\"c-call-to-action-box__text\">\n    Want to learn more?

We���re excited to highlight some of the features the team has worked hard to build.</p>\n<p>This tool makes your 1Password account accessible entirely from the command line. It gives you robust ways to interact with and manage your 1Password account.</p>\n<h2 id=\"working-with-items\">Working with items</h2>\n<p>The command-line tool makes it easy to create a new item in 1Password with <code>op create item</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>op create item server title=Staging username=admin@example.com url=sftp://staging.example.com\n</code></pre>\n<p>The new <code>op edit item</code> command allows you to update an item directly from the command line. Now you can update dozens or even hundreds of items at once with some simple scripting.</p>\n<pre><code>op edit item ���Personal Visa��� pin=8910\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can also get specific field values from items using the <code>get item</code> command and the new <code>--fields</code> option. This is super convenient when you want to use information that���s stored securely in 1Password in your command-line workflows.</p>\n<pre><code>op get item GitLab --fields password,token\n</code></pre>\n<p>This 1.0 release also gives you the ability to generate a strong password with the <code>--generate-password</code> option. It works with <code>create item</code> and <code>edit item</code> commands. You can even customize the password recipe to adjust the length and character types to use.</p>\n<pre><code>op create item login --vault Streaming title=Petflix --generate-password\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"taking-command\">Taking command</h2>\n<p>It&rsquo;s just as efficient to perform administrative tasks in the terminal as it is to manage items. With a single command, you can add, confirm, or remove users from your account, as well as assign users access to specific groups and vaults. Running <code>op create user</code> adds a new user to your account and the <code>add user</code> command can grant them additional access. You can also specify a user&rsquo;s role within a group using the <code>--role</code> option.</p>\n<pre><code>op add user paddy@1password.com Directors\nop add group Directors Financials\n</code></pre>\n<p>The new <code>op list users</code> options, <code>--group</code> and <code>--vault</code>, allow you to see who has access to what and make changes that align with your organization���s access policies.</p>\n<pre><code>op list users --group Directors\n</code></pre>\n<p>That&rsquo;s just a sample of all of the administrative commands you have at your disposal.

It���s something we covered in detail in <a href=\"https://blog.1password.com/what-is-phishing-and-how-can-you-protect-yourself/\">What is phishing, and how can you protect yourself?</a></p>\n<p>As someone who works for 1Password, security is a big focus of mine. I���m happy to admit that this job has made me far more paranoid than I used to be, and naturally I use 1Password to make sure all my passwords are strong, unique, and have never been <a href=\"https://blog.1password.com/773-million-collection-1/\">included in any breach</a>. I&rsquo;ve read our internal security guide many times over, and I took part in a company-wide security training session just recently at our annual company get-together.</p>\n<p>You���d think all this preparation would keep me safe from phishing ��� but last week, I was <em>nearly</em> caught by an SMS phishing attempt. If I can be caught out, so can you, and so I write this post in the hope that my experience will encourage others to be cautious.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-perfect-time-and-place\">The perfect time and place</h2>\n<p>In January, the 1Password team got together in Florida for our annual AGConf, and I was waiting in Miami airport for my flight home when the perfect storm of events began to occur.</p>\n<p>I went to the store for some water and a packet of cinnamon Altoids (you can���t get them in ��������) and weirdly my Scotiabank Amex card was declined. I tried my MasterCard and same thing ��� no dice.</p>\n<p>Resigning myself to being dehydrated and not having spicy cinnamon candy for the journey, I gave up and boarded my flight, planning on calling my bank when I got home.</p>\n<p>I reconnected my cell phone when I landed in Toronto and the usual flood of notifications came in. One of these was an SMS from my bank.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/smishing/sms.png' alt='fraudulent sms image' title='fraudulent sms image' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>In my tired state I clicked the link without thinking. My card had been blocked, so a message was expected ��� the timing was perfect. As I hit the website on my phone, I remembered the security training we&rsquo;d completed the week before and began to question what I was seeing.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/smishing/screen.png' alt='fraudulent website image' title='fraudulent website image' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>I went back to the SMS. Let���s list the errors there:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Last time I checked, Scotiabank wasn���t spelled with a 0 (SC0TIABANK)</li>\n<li>My &ldquo;client card&rdquo;? That���s a weird way of saying it���</li>\n<li>4536 is quoted. The first 4 numbers of a card are public knowledge.</li>\n<li>Hang on a minute��� scotiabank.ca is a subdomain, not the actual domain!</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There were even more clues on the webpage:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The biggest one is the lack of padlock in the address bar. This indicates that the site isn&rsquo;t using SSL to encrypt the connection ��� that���s a big no-no for a bank.</li>\n<li>That Online Security Guarantee is very badly designed. Not sure the real Scotiabank would let that slide.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I closed the page, thankful that I hadn���t provided any personal information, but concerned that I&rsquo;d so nearly given someone access to all my bank accounts.</p>\n<h2 id=\"lesson-learned\">Lesson learned</h2>\n<p>Everyone is vulnerable ��� whether you&rsquo;re an expert or have no security background at all. If the conditions are right, you can be caught out.</p>\n<p>I was just the right level of distracted and tired that I nearly fell for this, and by total chance the timing of the message was perfect for my circumstance. Suffice it to say, I will be even more paranoid from now on, and I hope you will be too!</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re using 1Password already and want to improve your personal security, running a <a href=\"https://support.1password.com/watchtower/\">Watchtower report</a> is a great place to start. You can also keep your credit cards in 1Password, and a great tip that I got from a colleague is to add the <a href=\"https://support.1password.com/custom-fields/\">emergency number on the back of the card to the item in 1Password</a> ��� that way, if your card is lost, you can still easily cancel it.</p>\n<section class=\"c-call-to-action-box c-call-to-action-box--yellow c-call-to-action-box--background-author c-call-to-action-box--background-author-yellow\">\n<div class=\"c-call-to-action-box__author\">\n<img src=\"https://blog.1password.com/img/authors/willmoore.jpg\" class=\"c-call-to-action-box__author-image c-call-to-action-box__author-image--yellow\" alt=\"Will Moore\"/>\n</div>\n<div class=\"c-call-to-action-box__content\">\n<h3 class=\"c-call-to-action-box__title c-call-to-action-box__title--yellow\">Not using 1Password yet?</h3>\n<div class=\"c-call-to-action-box__text c-call-to-action-box__text--yellow\">\nIncrease your personal security by starting a 1Password membership today.\n</div>\n<a href=\"https://1password.com/sign-up/\" class=\"c-call-to-action-box__link-href c-call-to-action-box__link-href--stacked c-call-to-action-box__link-href--yellow\" data-on=\"click\" data-event-category=\"CTA\" data-event-action=\"call-to-action-button\">\nGet 30 days FREE\n</a>\n</div>\n</section>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 07 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":10468,"bgimg":"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/smishing/header.png","linkMd5":"97d67e09c3dbe9b69a72085c8dd66767","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn30@2020_5/2020/08/25/00-54-53-228_c5259b247a40b797.webp","destWidth":2080,"destHeight":800,"sourceBytes":90749,"destBytes":79296,"author":"Will Moore","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/smishing/header.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn30@2020_5/2020/08/25/00-54-53-228_c5259b247a40b797.webp","https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/smishing/sms.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn32@2020_4/2020/08/25/00-55-03-883_abe3a217ceda88b6.webp","https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/smishing/screen.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn76@2020_5/2020/08/25/00-55-12-580_fc80ee6fa57317c2.webp","https://blog.1password.com/img/authors/willmoore.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn24@2020_1/2020/08/25/00-55-07-389_85eace85afec1ee2.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598316891416},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:54:51","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:54:51","title":"Smooth sailing with 1Password on the new Apple betas","link":"https://blog.1password.com/1password-apple-betas/","description":"\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/macos-beta-release/header.png' class='webfeedsFeaturedVisual' alt='Smooth sailing with 1Password on the new Apple betas' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p class=\"introduction\">WWDC, Apple&rsquo;s annual Worldwide Developers Conference, happened in San Jose earlier this month. It&rsquo;s an exciting opportunity for developers from all over the world to meet and talk with Apple engineers and for Apple to show off their upcoming software.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/macos-beta-release/iphonedm.png' alt='1Password in dark mode on iOS 13' title='1Password in dark mode on iOS 13' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>The conference always kicks off with a keynote, and this year it was bursting with announcements and updates. The most exciting news for our team was the announcement of brand new versions of <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-13-preview/\">iOS</a>, <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/ipados/ipados-preview/\">iPadOS</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/macos/catalina-preview/\">macOS</a>! Roo has already talked about how impressed he is by <a href=\"https://blog.1password.com/ios-voice-control-wwdc/\">Voice Control in iOS 13</a> and how excited he is for <a href=\"https://blog.1password.com/ios-dark-mode-wwdc/\">Dark Mode for iOS</a> to finally arrive.</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re a member of the <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/programs/\">Apple Developer Program</a>, the developer beta versions of all three pieces of software announced at WWDC are already available to download and install.</p>\n<p>All of the software previews were absolutely stunning, and we know 1Password 7 will look amazing on all of them. But the best part? If you have <a href=\"https://support.1password.com/explore/whats-new-mac/\">1Password 7</a> installed, everything should work as expected on the iOS 13, iPad OS and Catalina developer betas. You can keep using 1Password in your daily workflow without fear of any significant interruptions.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/macos-beta-release/wwdc-inline-mac.png' alt='1Password 7 on macOS Catalina' title='1Password 7 on macOS Catalina' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>However, since everything is in closed beta, you may run into some glitches here and there with your 1Password workflow.

It&rsquo;s been re-built, re-designed, and moved to a new home on 1Password.com. It&rsquo;s the fastest and most efficient experience we can give readers and we really love it. Learn how we built it as a static, serverless site with Hugo and AWS.</p>\n<p>Our blog has seen many homes over the years, going all the way back to the <a href=\"https://www.switchersblog.com/\">original one</a> nearly 13 years ago (which is impressively still live on the internet today).</p>\n<p>You may have already noticed the new blog you&rsquo;re reading on now as it&rsquo;s been around for a couple months, but today, we&rsquo;re happy to officially announce it! As well as the retirement of our previous one at blog.agilebits.com. Be sure to <a href=\"https://blog.1password.com/index.xml\">subscribe via RSS</a> and follow us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/1Password\">Twitter</a> or <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/1Password\">Facebook</a> to stay up to date with our news, announcements, security tips, and all things 1Password.</p>\n<p>The previous blog was built with WordPress, which served us well for the past decade, but we figured we could do better and build something more lightweight, fast, and secure. And of course there&rsquo;s also new gorgeous design that not only matches the style of our other sites but looks all around amazing. I mean, look at that header artwork at the top of all the posts!</p>\n<h2 id=\"building-a-strong-foundation-with-hugo\">Building a strong foundation with Hugo</h2>\n<p>We love using static sites for their performance, security, and simplicity. The entire site&rsquo;s content is created at build time. No server logic, no databases, just plain old HTML files.</p>\n<p>We chose <a href=\"https://gohugo.io\">Hugo</a> a while ago for our main <a href=\"https://1password.com\">1Password.com</a> site, so migrating our blog to it as well was a natural fit. The builds are quick, and it&rsquo;s easy to use, for both our developers and content writers. Each blog post is simply a Markdown file and it all lives in a GitLab project. Merge requests make for a perfect way to do content reviews.</p>\n<p>Hugo is very active project too ��� we&rsquo;ve been taking advantage of several of their recently added features like <a href=\"https://gohugo.io/hugo-pipes/scss-sass/\">built-in SCSS processing</a>, and <a href=\"https://gohugo.io/hugo-pipes/fingerprint/\">asset fingerprinting</a> which is useful for cache busting.</p>\n<h2 id=\"faster-performance-\">Faster performance ���</h2>\n<p>Building something that loads super fast was essential to us. This is an area our previous WordPress blog certainly fell short on:</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/new-blog/lighthouse-audit-old.png' alt='Lighthouse audit results on old blog' title='Lighthouse audit results on old blog' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>Having a fully static site without the overhead of dynamically generating pages is a great start. Plus it allows 100% of the content that is loaded to be served by a content delivery network (CDN) which uses local caches near you to minimize network delays.</p>\n<p>Keeping the page size small is critical as well. Our home page now weighs just 800kb and uses less than 20 network requests, with much better results:</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/new-blog/lighthouse-audit-new.png' alt='Lighthouse audit results on new blog' title='Lighthouse audit results on new blog' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>These tests were performed with Google&rsquo;s new <a href=\"https://web.dev/measure\">Lighthouse audit tool</a>, which is a great way to see how your site is doing. It points out modern best practices you might not be following, such as image optimzation, and minifying your CSS and JavaScript. If you run a website, I&rsquo;d highly recommend giving your site a test, you&rsquo;ll almost certainly learn some good tips.</p>\n<h2 id=\"stronger-security-\">Stronger Security ����</h2>\n<p>Security is at the top of our minds in everything we do, and our blog is no exception.</p>\n<p>Using a first-party solution that&rsquo;s fully in our control is imperative, in addition to adhering to the same front-end security best practices we use with everything on 1Password.com, such as having a strict <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP\">Content Security Policy</a>. It&rsquo;s also extremely important to us for changes be made in a trackable and reviewable manner (with Git), along with having a locked down deployment process.</p>\n<p>Going back to the benefits of static sites, there&rsquo;s a lot less that can go wrong with static HTML files versus a complex platform like Wordpress.</p>\n<h2 id=\"serverless-infrastructure-\">Serverless Infrastructure ����</h2>\n<p>The blog runs on a serverless setup with Amazon Web Services (AWS) taking advantage of several of their services.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/new-blog/aws.png' alt='AWS infrastructure diagram' title='AWS infrastructure diagram' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>It starts with S3, short for Simple Storage Service, which is cloud file storage ��� this is where all the Hugo generated content lives. It&rsquo;s a perfect place for storing static resources and is very reliable with almost no downtime.</p>\n<p>On top of that is CloudFront, a content delivery network (CDN) that speeds up the serving of our content through a global network of edge locations. When you load the site, you&rsquo;ll get routed to an edge location near you which provides the lowest delay. It also handles extras like the custom domain, TLS, HTTP/2, and GZIP, all with no additional configuration.</p>\n<p>We also use <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-edge.html\">Lambda@Edge</a>, this is a newer AWS service that allows small snippets of code to run at the edge locations in response to CloudFront requests. When we tried to build a similar static site setup a few years ago, we were left wanting a few little features server-side features like the ability to add HTTP headers and perform redirects/rewrites. The introduction of Lambda@Edge has solved that for us, allowing a static, serverless site but still lending a few pieces of functionality that would normally only be available with a traditional server.</p>\n<p>In addition to CloudFront providing support for HTTPS, AWS Certificate Manager makes issuing and managing your TLS certificate effortless, and it seamlessly integrates with CloudFront. <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/security/encrypt-in-transit/why-https\">HTTPS is the future of the web</a> ��� every site should support it (even your blog). And if you&rsquo;re using AWS, there&rsquo;s really no excuse as they make it incredibly easy, and free.</p>\n<p>We manage all this with <a href=\"https://www.terraform.io\">Terraform</a>, which is a tool for writing infrastructure setup as code. We&rsquo;ve talked previously about how we already use this for our 1Password.com service, I&rsquo;ll let you <a href=\"https://blog.1password.com/terraforming-1password/\">check out that post</a> if you&rsquo;d like to learn more. For this project, Terraform made it simple to create an identical internal testing site for previewing posts before we publish them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"deployment-\">Deployment ����</h2>\n<p>The final step was setting up automatic building and deployment of all this. We decided on GitLab CI, which is built right into GitLab projects.</p>\n<p>To run the CI build, you&rsquo;ll need a <a href=\"https://www.docker.com\">Docker</a> container with your dependencies installed, such as Hugo, Terraform, AWS CLI, and Node. The same container also works perfectly for those who want to build it locally, all you need to install is Docker Desktop.</p>\n<p>Then it&rsquo;s as simple as adding a few commands to the <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/\">GitLab CI config file</a>. From there, it builds the site with Hugo, runs some <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_%28software%29\">linters</a> to make sure all content is as good as it can be, syncs the static files to S3, applies Terraform changes if needed, and creates a CloudFront invalidation.</p>\n<p>This happens with every commit ��� it deploys to our internal preview site, and then to production on every merge to master.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/new-blog/gitlab-ci.png' alt='GitLab CI' title='GitLab CI' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<h2 id=\"beyond-the-blog\">Beyond the blog</h2>\n<p>We&rsquo;re really happy with how this turned out and are now using this exact setup across many of our web properties, including the main <a href=\"https://1password.com\">1Password.com</a> site and even <a href=\"https://watchtower.1password.com\">Watchtower</a>.

It���s great if you���re using Linux or Chrome OS and has quickly become my favourite way to enjoy 1Password on the web.</p>\n<p>Since <a href=\"https://blog.1password.com/1password-x-a-look-at-the-future-of-1password-in-the-browser/\">launching in November</a> we&rsquo;ve been hard at work exploring what&rsquo;s possible and polishing everything else. I&rsquo;d love to share with you what&rsquo;s new since 1Password X blasted off! ����</p>\n<h2 id=\"our-best-password-generator-yet\">Our best password generator yet</h2>\n<p>One of the things that we wanted to explore in 1Password X was how could we make our beloved password generator even better. And we were willing to go back to the drawing board to make it happen.</p>\n<p>We started by suggesting new passwords directly within websites:</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/b5x1.6/evernote-suggested-password.png' alt='1Password X suggesting a password when signing up to Evernote' title='1Password X suggesting a password when signing up to Evernote' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>Just click Use Suggested Password when signing up and you&rsquo;ve secured this website. It&rsquo;s incredibly easy and perfect for most sites.</p>\n<p>Some websites, however, don&rsquo;t accept long passwords. Or sometimes you need a memorable password or a numeric PIN code.</p>\n<p>1Password X now has a fully customizable password generator and it���s our best one yet! When you need a custom password just open 1Password from the toolbar and bring up the password generator:</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/b5x1.6/evernote-secure-password-generator.png' alt='1Password X&#39;s secure password generator' title='1Password X&#39;s secure password generator' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>In addition to looking amazing, our new generator is more powerful and easier to use than ever. You can customize everything and choose between different kinds of passwords depending on your needs.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/b5x1.6/select-password-type.png' alt='Selecting a password type in 1Password X' title='Selecting a password type in 1Password X' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>I&rsquo;ve always enjoyed the simplicity of our password generator and didn&rsquo;t want to lose that as we added more options. I&rsquo;m incredibly thankful that our designers found a way to pack so much power into such a simple and beautiful window.</p>\n<h2 id=\"smarter-filling-and-saving\">Smarter filling and saving</h2>\n<p>Using machine learning, we can now distinguish between registration forms and sign-in forms. This is incredibly cool as it allows us to anticipate what you need and suggest appropriate actions.</p>\n<p>When you&rsquo;re on a sign-in form, 1Password X will offer to fill it for you. If you&rsquo;re on a registration form, it will suggest a strong, unique password for you to use. And if you need to change an existing password, 1Password X can help you there, too:</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/b5x1.6/update-saved-login-evernote.png' alt='Updating the login saved for Evernote' title='Updating the login saved for Evernote' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>Along with these more visible improvements, we also greatly improved form filling all around (especially credit cards and identities) and added support for those running in Incognito mode.</p>\n<h2 id=\"faster-everything\">Faster everything</h2>\n<p>Feel the need for speed? 1Password X is packed full of it! Unlocking 1Password is now over 30 times faster and loading your items is instantaneous.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m now able to unlock 1Password X on my 2014 MacBook Pro faster than I can type my Master Password. I have over 3000 items in 50+ vaults spanning two accounts and I have access to everything I need before I can say &ldquo;oh my&rdquo;. ����</p>\n<p>In addition to blazing unlock speeds, you&rsquo;re also able to view your item details and fill Logins faster than ever.</p>\n<p>To achieve this incredible speed, 1Password X caches your encrypted data locally so it&rsquo;s always available. That means you always have access to your data, even when you don&rsquo;t have internet or are on spotty Wi-Fi.</p>\n<h2 id=\"and-so-much-more\">And so much more</h2>\n<p>We&rsquo;ve added over <a href=\"https://app-updates.agilebits.com/product_history/B5X\">120 new features and improvements</a> to 1Password X since our inaugural 1.0 release. In addition to the highlights above, some more of our favourites include creating new items, customizable auto-lock settings, and full support for Japanese!</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/b5x1.6/japanese-inline-menu.png' alt='1Password X in Japanese suggesting a newly generated password in Japanese' title='1Password X in Japanese suggesting a newly generated password in Japanese' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>To get started, all you need to do is <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/1password-x-%E2%80%93-password-ma/aeblfdkhhhdcdjpifhhbdiojplfjncoa\">install 1Password X</a> and sign in to your 1Password account.</p>\n<h2 id=\"oh-and-theres-one-more-thing\">Oh, and there&rsquo;s one more thing</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/1password-x-%E2%80%93-password-ma/aeblfdkhhhdcdjpifhhbdiojplfjncoa\">1Password X</a> initially came out for Google Chrome and since then we&rsquo;ve added support for Vivaldi, Ghost Browser, and coming very soon, Opera.

We���ve discovered there���s <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safari_release_notes/safari_13_beta_release_notes\">lots to love</a> about Safari 13, but we���ve also learned that it will no longer work for customers using 1Password 6.</p>\n<p>Those already using 1Password 7 are all set: 1Password 7 is ready for Safari 13, so you won���t miss a beat.</p>\n<p>If you���re still using 1Password 6 in Safari, you don���t have to do anything immediately, but you&rsquo;ll need to take action soon to prevent interruptions to your workflow when Safari 13 arrives.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1password-7-supports-safari-13\">1Password 7 supports Safari 13</h2>\n<p>The best way to experience Safari 13 is by using 1Password 7.</p>\n<p>1Password 7 is <a href=\"https://support.1password.com/upgrade-mac/\">included with every 1Password membership</a>, and contains a ton of new features to help you organise and secure your life. A few highlights:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Watchtower can now tell you when items you&rsquo;ve saved in 1Password ��� like credit cards, driver licenses and passports �����are about to expire. Plus, it can tell you what sites support two-factor authentication, and whether or not you&rsquo;ve enabled it.</li>\n<li>1Password mini is smarter, faster, and more helpful than ever. It suggests passwords for the apps on your Mac, not just when you&rsquo;re browsing the web.</li>\n<li>Everything has been entirely redesigned since 1Password 6, and that doesn&rsquo;t just mean it looks fresh. The new sidebar makes it easier to switch between vaults and investigate security issues with your logins, and items now display the most important information front and center.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With a whole bunch of new ways to organize your life, 1Password 7 is the perfect companion to the speedy and secure Safari 13. ����</p>\n<p>For those with a 1Password 6 license, we&rsquo;re offering you <a href=\"https://start.1password.com/sign-up/family?c=CATALINA\">your first 3 months of 1Password Families for free</a> so you can test-drive a 1Password membership before Safari 13 lands on your Mac this fall.</p>\n<h2 id=\"soldiering-on-with-1password-6\">Soldiering on with 1Password 6</h2>\n<p>1Password 6 will continue to work with other browsers. Safari lovers like myself won���t want to hear this one, but if you���re stuck and really can���t upgrade, you can still use 1Password 6 in Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and Vivaldi.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whats-changing\">What���s changing</h2>\n<p>In previous versions of Safari, extensions were installed via the Safari Extensions Gallery. In Safari 13, the Safari Extensions Gallery is being replaced with Safari App Extensions.</p>\n<p>It���s great Apple is doing this as Safari App Extensions are faster, lighter and more secure. They run through native Mac apps, meaning they put much less strain on memory and CPU performance. Plus, they&rsquo;re less vulnerable to security exploits like man-in-the-middle attacks. And, as the extensions are bundled right in with the apps you download, you don���t have to worry about compatibility issues, or downloading the wrong extension by mistake.</p>\n<p>1Password 6 was retired over a year ago and, as an older app, it still relies on an extension from the Safari Extensions Gallery. Safari 13 offers a better browsing experience all round, but to embrace the new, we have to let go of the old.</p>\n<p>In addition to its inclusion in macOS Catalina, we expect Safari 13 to also be released as an update for everyone using macOS High Sierra and Mojave, so we���d recommend making plans now as this is very likely to affect you.</p>\n<p>We���ll be discussing this change over on <a href=\"https://discussions.agilebits.com/discussion/104999/1password-6-legacy-support-information\">our forum</a>, so be sure to join us if you���d like to learn more!</p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 28 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":10468,"bgimg":"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/safari-13/header.png","linkMd5":"1c0af39bb81a83981609686252a03624","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn1@2020_1/2020/08/25/00-54-55-322_d24146b41987f21b.webp","destWidth":2080,"destHeight":800,"sourceBytes":44111,"destBytes":61530,"author":"Michael Fey","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/safari-13/header.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn1@2020_1/2020/08/25/00-54-55-322_d24146b41987f21b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598316891415},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:54:51","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:54:51","title":"Introducing 1Password 7.3 Beta for Windows","link":"https://blog.1password.com/introducing-1password-7.3-beta-for-windows/","description":"\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/opw-7.3.602beta/header.png' class='webfeedsFeaturedVisual' alt='Introducing 1Password 7.3 Beta for Windows' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p class=\"introduction\">1Password 7.3 for Windows is around the corner, and you can help us get it ready. There&rsquo;s lots to look forward to, and we&rsquo;re sure you&rsquo;ll agree that this is the best 1Password that Windows has ever seen.</p>\n<p>We&rsquo;ve been working on this update for some time, and we want to make sure that it&rsquo;s as awesome as can be. That means we&rsquo;re still a few weeks away from the release of 1Password 7.3 for Windows, but if you want to test the waters and help us create something awesome, you can <a href=\"https://app-updates.agilebits.com/product_history/OPW6#beta\">download the latest beta release</a> right now.</p>\n<p>Whenever you download 1Password 7.3 for Windows ��� beta or otherwise ��� you&rsquo;re going to see plenty changes this time around. They all build on the strong foundations that 1Password 7 gave us earlier this year, and we wanted to give you a quick sneak-peak of what you can expect.</p>\n<p>We think that you&rsquo;re going to love 1Password 7.3 for Windows, and here&rsquo;s why.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1password-gains-its-own-desktop\">1Password gains its own desktop</h2>\n<p>Now 1Password is even safer with the addition of &ldquo;Unlock using Secure Desktop.&rdquo; 1Password can now be unlocked in its own secure desktop, with no other apps active alongside it. This helps to prevent keyloggers from capturing anything you type.</p>\n<h2 id=\"a-whole-new-installer\">A whole new installer</h2>\n<p>We&rsquo;ve greased just the right wheels to make sure no one ever sees &ldquo;File in use&rdquo; again. Our new installer gives us more flexibility when it comes to how 1Password is installed and will prevent any false positives from security solutions, too.</p>\n<h2 id=\"templates-now-speak-your-language\">Templates now speak your language</h2>\n<p>1Password 7.3 for Windows uses localizations for all item templates. That means that all of your item templates will be in your own language, including all new items you create.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/opw-7.3.602beta/templates-speak-your-language.png' alt='Templates in multiple langauges' title='Templates in multiple langauges' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<h2 id=\"improved-stability-and-performance\">Improved stability and performance</h2>\n<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s the intangibles that make all the difference, and performance is a great example of that. Everyone wants their apps to be responsive and immediately available. We couldn&rsquo;t agree more, and now 1Password 7.3 for Windows is faster and more stable than ever.</p>\n<h2 id=\"watchtower-is-now-stronger-taller-and-more-watchful\">Watchtower is now stronger, taller, and more watchful</h2>\n<p>Watchtower is often the unsung hero of 1Password, but it gets the love it deserves in this release. Now, 1Password ranks Watchtower banners by their severity, meaning those items at the greatest risk will now be easier to spot, helping you see the wood through the trees.</p>\n<h2 id=\"faster-and-more-reliable-sync-for-standalone-vaults\">Faster and more reliable sync for standalone vaults</h2>\n<p>Great news, with 1Password 7.3 for Windows, sync is now faster, smarter, and improved on all fronts. It&rsquo;s plain sailing from here on out for all of you rocking standalone vaults.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tweaks-as-far-as-the-eye-can-see\">Tweaks as far as the eye can see</h2>\n<p>This is just the tip of the 1Password iceberg, and there are many more improvements that have gone into this release, with even more to come. 1Password 7.3 for Windows is a huge update for us, and you can check out the <a href=\"https://app-updates.agilebits.com/product_history/OPW6#beta\">full release notes</a> for all the details. The overarching theme is a simple one ��� 1Password 7.3 for Windows is the same 1Password you know and love, but so much better.</p>\n<h2 id=\"get-it-now\">Get it now</h2>\n<p>Just like any other big software update, we need your help to make sure that 1Password 7.3 for Windows is as great as it can be. You can download the beta and put it through its paces.

He started out doing anything and everything that was needed but now focuses on working with businesses of all sizes.</p>\n<p>To help keep your business safe from <a href=\"https://blog.1password.com/what-is-phishing-and-how-can-you-protect-yourself/\">phishing attacks</a>, we&rsquo;ve put together five key points from their chat.</p>\n<h2 id=\"your-email-is-at-risk\">Your email is at risk</h2>\n<p>Despite the rise in popularity of Slack and other messages programs, email remains the largest communication model for businesses. The <a href=\"https://protonmail.com/blog/zero-access-encryption/\">data you send over email</a> is more vulnerable than you may think. Even internal emails can be intercepted and exposed if the right malware has been put into place.</p>\n<p>Even internal emails can be intercepted and exposed if the right malware has been put into place, but if you and the recipient of your email use an encrypted email server like <a href=\"https://protonmail.com/\">ProtonMail</a>, it makes it more difficult for third parties to read or tamper with your messages and the information they contain.</p>\n<h2 id=\"information-is-more-public-than-you-realize\">Information is more public than you realize</h2>\n<p>Nothing is as secret or as private as you&rsquo;d like to believe. Everything from your phone number to your social security number may be available to anyone who knows where to look. If a cybercriminal already has the right kind of information about you, it can be easy for them to convince you to hand over even more without realizing what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>\n<p>Anything you share online can potentially be used against you in an <a href=\"https://us.norton.com/internetsecurity-online-scams-how-to-protect-against-phishing-scams.html\">attempt to steal your information</a>, so even if you&rsquo;re job hunting and expecting an email from a recruiter, think twice before you send sensitive or confidential data over.</p>\n<h2 id=\"phishing-over-email\">Phishing over email</h2>\n<p>It&rsquo;s possible to get almost any information you need by asking the right person the right questions or getting the right person to click the wrong link. Often, a target may be phished for details regarding a password or login information for a simple, non-critical system. However, if that target <a href=\"https://blog.1password.com/how-to-protect-yourself-from-password-reuse-attacks/\">re-used their password</a> on more critical systems, their access has now been compromised and data can be accessed by the wrong people.</p>\n<p>Phishing emails usually appear to come from trusted sources, making them blend in with your inbox. Luckily there are some <a href=\"https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/recognize-phishing-emails/#gref\">easy ways to recognize a phishing email</a> to help you notice and take action when something is off.</p>\n<h2 id=\"test-your-security\">Test your security</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/top-10-reasons-why-pen-testing-is-important-to-help-meet-compliance/#gref\">Pen testing</a> within your organization can help you to locate your unique vulnerabilities. Finding these holes and sealing them up before the bad guys can exploit them will ensure that your data stays safe and secure.</p>\n<p>If your IT department needs assistance putting together a pen test, there are companies that can help. Kevin Mitnick&rsquo;s Global Ghost Team, <a href=\"https://mitnicksecurity.com/\">Mitnick Security</a>, provides one way to locate these holes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"educate-your-team\">Educate your team</h2>\n<p>Education is undeniably the best protection you have against phishing, which is why it&rsquo;s been a common theme in our webinar series. Your employees may be well-intentioned, but everyone from the CEO down needs the right tools and information to protect themselves and your business.</p>\n<p>Taking the time to <a href=\"https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/category/enterprise/phishing/phishing-countermeasures/anti-phishing-the-importance-of-phishing-awareness-training/#gref\">educate your team on how to spot phishing attempts</a> is a necessary investment.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whats-up-next\">What���s up next</h2>\n<p>If you enjoyed this chat with Alex, <a href=\"https://1password.com/webinars/\">sign up</a> to find out about our upcoming webinars.

Each episode blends informative discussions with humor as we talk about what&rsquo;s new in the world of security.</p>\n<p>In this post, we&rsquo;re giving you a peek behind the curtain at how our podcast comes together.</p>\n<h2 id=\"planning-and-research\">Planning and research</h2>\n<p>You can���t just wing it when recording a podcast. That&rsquo;s how you get long tangents about where to find the best tacos in Toronto. Which, while informative, isn&rsquo;t exactly the breaking security news we want to cover. That&rsquo;s why we have a list of items we need to complete before we can sit down and record.</p>\n<p>Each episode focuses on a single theme or security topic. Since our goal is to help our audience make the best security choices, we keep an eye on the hot topics in security and privacy. This not only gives our guests an idea of what to talk about, but it also helps keep Matt and Roo on task during the conversation.</p>\n<p>Once we���ve selected a theme, we research the latest stories for our Watchtower Weekly segment and decide which hack we���ll be revisiting that episode.</p>\n<h2 id=\"getting-the-perfect-guest\">Getting the perfect guest</h2>\n<p>We&rsquo;ve been lucky to have a wide range of insightful and fun guests join us for the podcast, including Troy Hunt, Bruce Schneier, and Dr. Jessica Barker. We look for guests who are experts in their fields, have valuable insight to offer, or have knowledge of a specific topic we think our audience might find interesting.</p>\n<p>We like to keep things informal, but we also want our guests to feel comfortable and prepared when they record their part. We send them a list of questions before recording, as well as a Random but Memorable guest checklist to give them hints and tips so recording goes as smoothly as possible.</p>\n<h2 id=\"recording-the-show\">Recording the show</h2>\n<p>With our hosts located in different cities and time zones, scheduling can be tricky. We use a <a href=\"https://zoom.us/\">Zoom</a> audio conference to bridge the distance and record each episode. Each host records the session locally to capture the best sound.</p>\n<p>Since a podcast relies on good audio, one of the most important things we&rsquo;ve learned is how crucial it is to invest in a quality microphone. Matt and I both use <a href=\"http://en.rode.com/\">Rode mics</a>, while Roo favors an <a href=\"https://www.audio-technica.com/cms/wired_mics/b8dd84773f83092c/index.html\">Audio Technica ATR2100</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"getting-it-ready-to-release\">Getting it ready to release</h2>\n<p>Editing the podcast is the most critical ��� and often challenging ��� part of the process. This is where I take a 90-minute recording and condense it down to a neat and clean 30-minute show.</p>\n<p>I go through the content our hosts and guests have recorded and cut any content that&rsquo;s not relevant, like unnecessary umms and aaahs that are inevitable during the course of a conversation. I also keep an ear out for any foul language slip-ups that need bleeping to keep the show family-friendly.</p>\n<p>It���s also my responsibility to create the show notes that we share alongside the audio of each episode. These comprehensive notes are great for skimming over and referencing after listening. We often cover so much content in a single episode that this document can reach a double-digit page count.</p>\n<h2 id=\"sending-it-out-into-the-world\">Sending it out into the world</h2>\n<p>Once the final edit has been cut, we&rsquo;re ready to release! New episodes are available every other Tuesday on all major podcast channels and apps.

This left the affected users vulnerable and searchable by more than 20,000 employees ��� with around 2000 taking advantage of this. However, Facebook did state that no passwords were shared or leaked externally.</p>\n<p>Any affected users will be directly notified, and Facebook is not advising anyone to change their password. But, given the number of employees who accessed those passwords, we���d urge you to err on the side of caution and change yours just in case.</p>\n<p>Instances like this, where passwords are stored and accessible in plain text, are a good example why you should use a unique password for each site. Having a unique password means that the bad practices of one company don���t lead to your <a href=\"https://blog.1password.com/how-to-protect-yourself-from-password-reuse-attacks/\">account being compromised</a> on other sites where you use the same password.</p>\n<p>To keep your passwords truly secure, change them any time you suspect they���ve been compromised.

For the first time ever, the App Store feels like one of the beautifully designed apps you���d go there to purchase ��� as well as a platform for discovering them.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/mas-journey/image_0.png' alt='Mac App Store main view' title='Mac App Store main view' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<h2 id=\"discovering-the-new-mac-app-store\">Discovering the new Mac App Store</h2>\n<p>Apple have recreated the Mac App Store from the ground up, and it���s a pleasure to use. There���s a joy in simply browsing: with the all-new Discover tab, Apple has introduced fascinating stories, in-depth interviews and weekly picks. These editorial features bring everything together, creating an ecosystem that celebrates the best of what app developers have to offer.</p>\n<p>This new iteration builds on the Featured tab and Editors��� Choice picks, but the experience feels a lot more user-oriented, with apps clustered together around objectives you might have����� like increasing your writing productivity or streamlining your workflow.

Most of us have been guilty at some point of reusing passwords or not making our passwords strong enough. But if you haven&rsquo;t corrected those mistakes, your past just may come back to haunt you.</p>\n<p>We&rsquo;re going to help you clear out those virtual cobwebs and set you up to defend against any ghosts that may be trying to haunt your old accounts.</p>\n<p>Here���s what you need to watch out for, and how to make sure all your accounts belong to the land of the living.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ghost-accounts\">Ghost accounts</h2>\n<p>The Internet moves fast, and in our enthusiasm to try the latest and greatest, we often leave old sites behind. You might not ever have intended to &ldquo;quit&rdquo; Myspace or Ello exactly; you probably visited less and less over time, until it had been months, then years, since your last sign-in. Dormant accounts like these never really go anywhere ��� and they can come back to haunt you in a data breach.</p>\n<p>Abandoned accounts are still full of personal and private information ��� everything from date of birth to credit card numbers ��� which leaves you vulnerable in the event of a data breach, like the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/myspace-security-account-takeover/\">one that happened to MySpace in 2013</a>. Your email address, password, security questions, and personal identification information could be exposed and dumped on hacker forums or the dark web.</p>\n<p>Go through and close any old accounts that you no longer use. But before you do, try to remove your address, phone number, and financial information and change it to dummy data. That way, even if the site doesn&rsquo;t wholly purge old accounts, your data is safe in the event of a breach.</p>\n<p>If you have older accounts that you don&rsquo;t visit frequently but need to keep open, make sure you���ve updated your password to something strong and unique, and add it to 1Password anyway. You might not visit the site often, but if you store it in 1Password, Watchtower will alert you if the site is ever breached.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/halloween-tips-tricks/resurrected-email-adresses.png' alt='Resurrected email adresses' title='Resurrected email adresses' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<h2 id=\"resurrected-email-addresses\">Resurrected email addresses</h2>\n<p>Abandoned email accounts have the potential to cause even more issues. If an old email address that you never check is listed as a recovery email for any of your current accounts, anyone with access to that email address could take full control of your other accounts by requesting a password reset.</p>\n<p>And, if that old email account is listed as the recovery address for your current email account, the situation becomes even more serious, and could result in somebody taking complete control of your online life ��� from hijacking your social profiles and payment sites, to impersonating you to people you know.</p>\n<p>This is a nightmare scenario, but it&rsquo;s easily avoided. To keep your information safe, treat old email accounts with the same care that you&rsquo;d treat your active ones ��� use a strong, unique password and two-factor authentication.</p>\n<h2 id=\"somebodys-watching-me\">Somebody���s watching me</h2>\n<p>If you���ve ever received an email with your own password in the subject line, you���ll know these scams can be terrifying: the sender claims they���ve hacked your webcam, and have video evidence of you engaging in some rather&hellip;private acts. All you have to do, the scammer says, is send them some bitcoin, and they���ll go away. If you refuse, they���ll share the videos with everyone on your contact list.</p>\n<p>This is known as a sextortion email, or <a href=\"https://blog.1password.com/email-blackmail-scams-getting-you-down-stay-safe-in-your-very-own-watchtower/\">email blackmail scam</a>. Often, the scammer obtained that password from an old data breach from a completely different site. But, if you���re using that same password on your email account, it can cause a moment of panic.</p>\n<p>You can safely ignore emails like this, but they serve as a good reminder to check Watchtower for any compromised passwords. If you find a password has been included in a data breach, and you���ve reused the same password on multiple sites, you���ll need to change it everywhere. This stops anybody from using that password to <a href=\"https://blog.1password.com/how-to-protect-yourself-from-password-reuse-attacks/\">access your other accounts</a> ��� or fooling you into thinking they can.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-doppelg��nger\">The doppelg��nger</h2>\n<p>An attack or breach on one service may seem bad enough, but when a breach is announced that affects you, it&rsquo;s worth keeping a close watch on your other accounts ��� especially if you���re in the public eye, or have a large social media presence.</p>\n<p>Credentials obtained from one data breach can be used to attempt to log in to other services, and data from one breach can be combined with data from other breaches, potentially giving attackers enough information to impersonate you online.</p>\n<h2 id=\"fun-size-halloween-security-tips\">Fun-size Halloween security tips</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Use strong, unique passwords for every account</li>\n<li>Delete old accounts where you can, and use strong passwords when you can���t</li>\n<li>Use 1Password to generate random answers to your security questions</li>\n<li>Turn on two-factor authentication where available</li>\n<li>Never invite a vampire to your 1Password Families account, even as a guest �������</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Have any password horror stories of your own?

If you���re sending your child off to college for the first time, take the opportunity before they leave to instill the security habits that will keep them safe in college and beyond.</p>\n<p>With a <a href=\"https://1password.com/families/\">1Password Families membership</a>, you can give your loved ones the tools to protect themselves ��� without taking away their independence.</p>\n<h2 id=\"get-the-basics-right\">Get the basics right</h2>\n<p>Start teaching your child good password management skills by adding them to your family account. If you have an individual account, you can <a href=\"https://support.1password.com/change-account-type/\">upgrade it on 1Password.com</a>.</p>\n<p>1Password keeps your family safe online by helping everybody create and use strong, unique passwords for all their accounts. And, because it makes it quicker and easier to sign in to apps and websites, they���ll actually want to use it.</p>\n<p>Students starting college need to sign up for a lot of new services, like school emails and online shopping accounts. It���s a lot to take in all at once. This is the perfect time to teach them how important it is to use a <a href=\"https://blog.1password.com/how-to-protect-yourself-from-password-reuse-attacks/\">strong, unique password</a> for every site.</p>\n<h2 id=\"store-everything-important\">Store everything important</h2>\n<p>Students are handed a lot of new information and documents in their first week of college. If they store them in 1Password, they���ll know just where to look when they need them.</p>\n<p>From software licenses to purchase receipts, and school files to credit cards, anything that���s worth keeping safe and private is best kept in 1Password. Students can keep copies of their driver&rsquo;s license and passport in case of emergencies, and any critical medical documents or private notes they might need.</p>\n<p>1Password syncs seamlessly between devices, so your child can access their school files and emails from their iPad at school, and again from their desktop computer when they���re home for the holidays.</p>\n<h2 id=\"easily-share-information\">Easily share information</h2>\n<p>1Password is the easiest and safest way to share passwords, credit cards, and anything else that&rsquo;s too important to email. So when your child needs your credit card number to order books for next semester, it���s easy to share it with them ��� just add it to your shared vault.</p>\n<p>Your shared vault can also be used to store your family���s Netflix password, insurance cards, and anything else your child may need access to while they���re away from home. You can add new items as needed, update existing ones, or remove outdated information and it will update automatically for everyone in your family.</p>\n<h2 id=\"keep-personal-things-private\">Keep personal things private</h2>\n<p>Not everything needs to be shared with the whole family, and it&rsquo;s a good bet that most students won&rsquo;t want their parents to have access to their social media accounts. In addition to shared family vaults, everybody in your family gets their own private vault so they can keep passwords, personal documents, and private notes safe from prying eyes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"defend-against-breaches\">Defend against breaches</h2>\n<p>As a parent, it&rsquo;s your job to protect your child, but you can&rsquo;t be with them every moment of every day. <a href=\"https://watchtower.1password.com/\">Watchtower</a>, included with every 1Password membership, can give you peace of mind when it comes to their online safety. Watchtower will alert them if any of the websites they use are compromised, or if any of their passwords are included in a data breach, so they can keep their accounts safe.</p>\n<section class=\"c-call-to-action-box c-call-to-action-box--background-author\">\n<div class=\"c-call-to-action-box__author\">\n<img src=\"https://blog.1password.com/img/authors/sarahbrown.jpg\" class=\"c-call-to-action-box__author-image\" alt=\"Sarah Brown\"/>\n</div>\n<div class=\"c-call-to-action-box__content\">\n<h3 class=\"c-call-to-action-box__title\">Sign up for 30 days free!</h3>\n<div class=\"c-call-to-action-box__text\">\nGive your child the tools they need to keep themselves safe online.

Microsoft Edge has been my go-to browser on the rare occasion I use a Windows PC, so I was excited to get a peek at how the browser, and 1Password, would work on my Mac.</p>\n<p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/living-on-the-microsoft-edge/1password-light.png' alt='1Password homepage - light mode' title='1Password homepage - light mode' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/living-on-the-microsoft-edge/1password-dark.png' alt='1Password homepage - dark mode' title='1Password homepage - dark mode' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n</p>\n<h2 id=\"solid-as-a-rock\">Solid as a rock</h2>\n<p>This new version of Microsoft Edge is built on Chromium, the same base that Chrome uses, making it more stable and reliable than the Internet Explorer of my early internet days. While it���s still only in beta, it feels speedy enough that it could easily fit into my day-to-day workflow without slowing me down or dragging my tasks out.</p>\n<p>And the best part is that on my Mac, Microsoft Edge not only looks like a native Mac application but it functions like one, too. All my go-to keyboard shortcuts work exactly as I expect them to, which means I don&rsquo;t have to move my mouse to open 1Password! With just a tap of the keys, I&rsquo;m able to sign in and access my saved information.</p>\n<p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/living-on-the-microsoft-edge/sign-in-light.png' alt='1Password homepage - light mode' title='1Password homepage - light mode' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/living-on-the-microsoft-edge/sign-in-dark.png' alt='1Password homepage - dark mode' title='1Password homepage - dark mode' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n</p>\n<h2 id=\"keep-it-secret-keep-it-safe\">Keep it secret, keep it safe</h2>\n<p>It can be challenging to know and track how different companies use the data I share. I love that Microsoft Edge pulls all my privacy and ad-tracking settings into a single location: the privacy dashboard. I&rsquo;m able to change the privacy and sharing settings as well as manage browsing data, clear search history, and even edit location data.</p>\n<p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/living-on-the-microsoft-edge/privacy-light.png' alt='Microsoft Edge Privacy Dashboard - light mode' title='Microsoft Edge Privacy Dashboard - light mode' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/living-on-the-microsoft-edge/privacy-dark.png' alt='Microsoft Edge Privacy Dashboard - dark mode' title='Microsoft Edge Privacy Dashboard - dark mode' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n</p>\n<p>I know my passwords are safe in 1Password, but having this level of control over my browser data gives me even more peace of mind.</p>\n<h2 id=\"join-the-dark-side\">Join the dark side</h2>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/living-on-the-microsoft-edge/toolbar-dark.png' alt='Microsoft Edge - dark mode' title='Microsoft Edge - dark mode' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>I&rsquo;m a huge fan of Dark Mode on my Mac, and I love how sleek it makes the Microsoft Edge browser look. And it doesn&rsquo;t hurt that Dark Mode really makes the 1Password icon pop in the toolbar.</p>\n<p>Of course, if you&rsquo;re more on the traditional side, the browser and icon look just as good in light mode too.</p>\n<h2 id=\"right-at-your-fingertips\">Right at your fingertips</h2>\n<p>Just like on Chrome, all the power of 1Password is right there in the toolbar. <a href=\"https://support.1password.com/getting-started-1password-x/\">1Password X</a> automatically syncs everything to my 1Password account, so I can switch between browsers, operating systems, and devices without missing a beat or forgetting a login.</p>\n<p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/living-on-the-microsoft-edge/1passwordx-light.png' alt='Microsoft Edge Privacy Dashboard - light mode' title='Microsoft Edge Privacy Dashboard - light mode' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/living-on-the-microsoft-edge/1passwordx-dark.png' alt='Microsoft Edge Privacy Dashboard - dark mode' title='Microsoft Edge Privacy Dashboard - dark mode' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n</p>\n<p>1Password X makes helpful suggestions as I browse the web, allowing me to painlessly sign in to accounts or fill credit card and billing information. If I need to create a new account, it pops up the password generator so I can create a complex and unique password. All with just a few simple keystrokes.</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re using the Microsoft Edge beta for Mac, you can <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/1password-x-%E2%80%93-password-ma/aeblfdkhhhdcdjpifhhbdiojplfjncoa?hl=en\">add 1Password X from the Chrome store</a>, just make sure you&rsquo;ve turned on the feature to <a href=\"https://pureinfotech.com/install-chrome-extension-chromium-edge/\">allow extensions from other stores</a>.</p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 29 May 2019 10:00:00 +0000","feedId":10468,"bgimg":"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/living-on-the-microsoft-edge/header.png","linkMd5":"04a4cb202434c263e6703b56d77ec2f4","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn22@2020_5/2020/08/25/00-54-53-110_5fd8c0a065848ef2.webp","destWidth":2080,"destHeight":800,"sourceBytes":26431,"destBytes":33378,"author":"Sarah Brown","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/living-on-the-microsoft-edge/header.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn22@2020_5/2020/08/25/00-54-53-110_5fd8c0a065848ef2.webp","https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/living-on-the-microsoft-edge/1password-light.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn67@2020_5/2020/08/25/00-55-02-405_e438dcf6fdc3d703.webp","https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/living-on-the-microsoft-edge/1password-dark.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn48@2020_5/2020/08/25/00-55-12-287_9a372d452efa177f.webp","https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/living-on-the-microsoft-edge/sign-in-light.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn41@2020_5/2020/08/25/00-55-00-233_92708d191e0226da.webp","https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/living-on-the-microsoft-edge/sign-in-dark.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn86@2020_3/2020/08/25/00-54-57-701_fd817adcd4e5b434.webp","https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/living-on-the-microsoft-edge/privacy-light.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn16@2020_1/2020/08/25/00-55-10-757_ad334dcfd944c4b5.webp","https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/living-on-the-microsoft-edge/privacy-dark.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn79@2020_4/2020/08/25/00-55-03-386_cd6460fefe3e65b2.webp","https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/living-on-the-microsoft-edge/toolbar-dark.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn12@2020_6/2020/08/25/00-55-08-755_dffe0a24fab75bc6.webp","https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/living-on-the-microsoft-edge/1passwordx-light.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn47@2020_3/2020/08/25/00-55-10-361_2d2bfe7bdc22d79f.webp","https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/living-on-the-microsoft-edge/1passwordx-dark.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn96@2020_1/2020/08/25/00-55-00-721_79140842f9ad216e.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598316891416},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:54:51","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:54:51","title":"Introducing 1Password Advanced Protection: powerful security tools for business","link":"https://blog.1password.com/introducing-advanced-protection/","description":"\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/advanced-protection/header.jpg' class='webfeedsFeaturedVisual' alt='Introducing 1Password Advanced Protection: powerful security tools for business' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p class=\"introduction\">Today, I���m excited to announce the release of 1Password Advanced Protection, a suite of powerful new security tools for <a href=\"https://1password.com/business/\">1Password Business</a>.</p>\n<p>With <a href=\"https://1password.com/business/advanced-protection/\">1Password Advanced Protection</a>, administrators have the power to create security policies, prevent threats, and monitor their team&rsquo;s access. We&rsquo;ve got five features to cover, so let&rsquo;s get started.</p>\n<h2 id=\"master-password-policy\">Master Password policy</h2>\n<p>Employee passwords are the biggest point of failure for most companies. With the <a href=\"https://support.1password.com/master-password-policy/\">Master Password policy</a>, administrators can enforce stricter Master Password requirements to match their internal security policies.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/advanced-protection/ap-masterpassword.png' alt='Screenshot of Master Password Policy controls in 1Password Advanced Protection' title='Screenshot of Master Password Policy controls in 1Password Advanced Protection' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>You can increase the minimum length, and require uppercase or lowercase letters, numbers, or symbols.

Then enforce two-factor authentication for your entire team to make sure no one slips through the cracks.</p>\n<h2 id=\"firewall-rules\">Firewall rules</h2>\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever wanted to restrict where your team can access 1Password, you&rsquo;ll love this. You can create <a href=\"https://support.1password.com/firewall-rules/\">firewall rules</a> to allow, report, or deny sign-in attempts from certain locations or IP addresses.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/advanced-protection/ap-firewall.png' alt='Screenshot of firewall rules in 1Password Advanced Protection' title='Screenshot of firewall rules in 1Password Advanced Protection' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>Whether you want to limit access to the office or block access from high-risk countries, you can create firewall rules to help you. You can even block VPNs and Tor to prevent anonymous IP access.</p>\n<h2 id=\"modern-app-requirements\">Modern app requirements</h2>\n<p>For the latest features and security fixes, we know how important it is to keep your software up to date. With <a href=\"https://support.1password.com/modern-app-requirements/\">modern app requirements</a>, you can make sure your employees are on the same page.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/advanced-protection/ap-apps.png' alt='Screenshot of setting modern app requirements 1Password Advanced Protection' title='Screenshot of setting modern app requirements 1Password Advanced Protection' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>Find out who uses outdated 1Password apps, and require everyone to keep 1Password up to date. If anyone uses an older version of 1Password, they&rsquo;ll be prompted to update to the latest release.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/advanced-protection/ap-reports.png' alt='Screenshot of app reports in 1Password Advanced Protection' title='Screenshot of app reports in 1Password Advanced Protection' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<h2 id=\"sign-in-attempts-report\">Sign-in attempts report</h2>\n<p>The final feature ties everything together. For more insight into account activity, the <a href=\"https://support.1password.com/sign-in-attempts-report/\">sign-in attempts report</a> gives you a clear overview of recently reported, blocked, and failed sign-in attempts.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/advanced-protection/ap-signin-attempts.png' alt='Screenshot of map showing failed sign in attempts in 1Password Advanced Protection' title='Screenshot of map showing failed sign in attempts in 1Password Advanced Protection' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>Review the time, location, IP address, and device of each sign-in attempt, and use the interactive map to view attempts from a specific location. Find out why they failed ��� whether they used the wrong credentials, two-factor authentication failed, or were blocked by your firewall rules ��� so you can assess how effective your policies are and adjust them to protect your team.</p>\n<h2 id=\"get-started-with-1password-advanced-protection\">Get started with 1Password Advanced Protection</h2>\n<div class=\"embed embed-16x9\">\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EMlrU4CKn4o\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe><br>\n</div>\n<p>1Password Advanced Protection is now available for all 1Password Business customers.

It gives you the tools to protect your employees, secure your most important data, and stay compliant. Your administrators will love it for the control it gives them, and your employees will love how easy it is to use.</p> \n<h2 id=\"control-access-and-be-compliant\">Control access and be compliant</h2> \n<p>GDPR, HIPAA, SOC2, PCI, PIPEDA��� man, there���re enough compliance requirements to make your head spin.</p> \n<p>Thankfully, 1Password helps by keeping you in control of who has access to what. Each employee gets a place to store their private, work-related passwords. But there are times when passwords need to be shared. For those times, it���s easy to share passwords with only the people who need them.</p> \n<p><strong>Fine-grained permissions</strong> ��� give employees exactly the access they need.</p> \n<p><strong>Custom Groups and Roles</strong> ��� organize your staff and their access.</p> \n<p><strong>Device Restrictions</strong> ��� limit where access is granted.</p> \n<p><strong>Managed Travel Mode</strong> ��� restrict employee access when travelling.</p> \n<img src=\"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/business-intro/devops-access.jpg\" alt=\"Managing access to a shared vault\" title=\"Managing access to a shared vault\" style=\"max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;\" /> \n<p>We ourselves are growing quickly and long gone are the days where everyone worked on every project.

They were open and honest about what happened and they should be congratulated.</p>\n<p>Many companies hide from the truth and make things much worse for themselves and their customers. Instead, MyFitnessPal did it right. Not only did they handle the disclosure with finesse, they also had excellent systems in place to limit the exposure of the leak.</p>\n<p>MyFitnessPal provides a great case study on how to handle a data breach and protect customer information. Let���s start with the announcement itself.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-announcement\">The Announcement</h2>\n<p>First it needs to be said that it was awesome that there actually was an announcement and that it was published in a timely manner. This is a very good thing!</p>\n<p>There was an <a href=\"https://content.myfitnesspal.com/security-information/notice.html\">in-app notification</a>, <a href=\"https://content.myfitnesspal.com/security-information/notice.html\">direct emails</a>, and a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MyFitnessPal/status/979751327612911617\">pinned Twitter post</a>.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/myfitnesspal/in-app-notification.jpeg' alt='In app notification about the MyFitnessPal data breach' title='In app notification about the MyFitnessPal data breach' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/myfitnesspal/pinned-tweet.jpeg' alt='A pinned Tweet from MyFitnessPal announcing their data breach' title='A pinned Tweet from MyFitnessPal announcing their data breach' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>They also posted <a href=\"https://content.myfitnesspal.com/security-information/FAQ.html\">Frequently Asked Questions</a> that were excellent and when I emailed their support team with some questions for this post, their automated reply included information about the breach and what they were doing to protect their customers.</p>\n<p>MyFitnessPal was incredibly open and transparent about everything and at no point did they try to hide details from their users, myself included! That allowed me to update my password and get on with my life.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/myfitnesspal/1password-x-change-password.jpeg' alt='A 1Password X update password prompt after changing the password on MyFitnessPal' title='A 1Password X update password prompt after changing the password on MyFitnessPal' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>I wasn���t overly attached to <code>qdd84b7UayEwM9J6dZV</code> anyway so I didn���t mind changing it. And since I only used this password on <a href=\"https://myfitnesspal.com/\">myfitnesspal.com</a> I didn���t need to update any other websites.</p>\n<p>Strong unique passwords FTW! ����</p>\n<h2 id=\"secure-handling-of-passwords\">Secure Handling of Passwords</h2>\n<p>Equally commendable was how MyFitnessPal stored passwords in their systems. Or more to the point, how they didn���t store passwords.</p>\n<p>Many sites choose to store the plain text password, which is bad. The fact that <a href=\"https://haveibeenpwned.com/\">Have I Been Pwned?</a> now has over a half a <em>billion</em> plain text passwords in their database shows how prevalent this horrible bad practice is.</p>\n<p>MyFitnessPal was much smarter than that as they never stored the actual password. Instead they stored a hash of the password, most of which were created using <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt\">bcrypt</a>. Our Chief Defender Against The Dark arts <a href=\"https://blog.agilebits.com/2015/03/30/bcrypt-is-great-but-is-password-cracking-infeasible/\">wrote at length</a> about bcrypt and how it can be used to protect user passwords.</p>\n<p>It���s possible to go even further than bcrypt and avoid sending passwords to the server by using <a href=\"https://blog.agilebits.com/2018/02/14/how-we-use-srp-and-you-can-too/\">Secure Remote Password</a>. We use this in 1Password and are <a href=\"https://blog.agilebits.com/2018/02/14/how-we-use-srp-and-you-can-too/\">quite smitten with it</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"avoiding-other-sensitive-information\">Avoiding Other Sensitive Information</h2>\n<p>The other smart thing MyFitnessPal does that should be commended is collecting and storing the minimum amount of data. From their FAQ:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The affected data did not include government-issued identifiers (such as Social Security numbers and driver���s license numbers) because we don���t collect that information from users. Payment card data was not affected because it is collected and processed separately.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The easiest way to protect data is to <em>not</em> have it in the first place! We follow a similar mentality in 1Password and it���s refreshing to see other companies taking security and privacy seriously.</p>\n<p>MyFitnessPal made some excellent design choices and quickly organized an effective response to a bad situation.</p>\n<p>For those looking to learn more about the MyFitnessPal breach, Troy Hunt started his <a href=\"https://www.troyhunt.com/weekly-update-80/\">Weekly Update 80</a> with a full discussion on the subject that I found very intriguing, especially the strategy on how to migrate from a SHA-1 hash to using bcrypt.</p>\n<p>P.S. A great deal of this post was inspired by an incredible letter I received from Benjamin Fox about how unique passwords helped him quickly recover from the MyFitnessPal breach. Thank you for the inspiration, Benjamin! ���</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Hi Dave,</p>\n<p>I know you get hundreds of emails but I can���t help but send this email. I received an email from MyFitnessPal today and of course the news-breaking headlines.</p>\n<p>In reading the email, I simply smiled.

Using the 1Password command-line tool, you can send your team���s 1Password activity to Splunk and keep track of it there alongside other happenings within your team.</p> \n<p>One of Splunk���s most popular features is the ability to find events and <a href=\"https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/7.0.3/Alert/Aboutalerts\">trigger alerts based on them</a>. For example, in your team you could set things up so the sysadmins are alerted whenever someone is added to the Owners group in 1Password. I���ll get into that example a bit more later in this post.</p> \n<h2 id=\"set-up-the-1password-command-line-tool\">Set up the 1Password command-line tool</h2> \n<p>To kick things off, let���s set up the 1Password command-line tool, if you���re not using it already:</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://support.1password.com/command-line-getting-started/\">1Password command-line tool: Getting started</a></p> \n<p>When setting up the tool, start by <a href=\"https://support.1password.com/custom-groups/\">creating a custom group and giving it the View Admin Console permission</a> so it can view the Activity Log, then add a user to that group. Once the tool is set up with that user���s account, get a session token:</p> \n<p><code>$ op signin example</code></p> \n<p>This will allow you to interactively enter the Master Password with secure input. Since you���re definitely putting this in a script, you���ll want to pass the Master Password through <code>stdin</code> to the <code>op signin</code> call to get your session token:</p> \n<p><code>[password] | op signin example.1password.com wendy_appleseed@example.com A3-XXXXXX-XXXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX</code></p> \n<p>To make things simpler, you can omit the email address and Secret Key from <code>op signin</code> since they are saved in <code>~/.op/config</code>. You can then simplify the whole sign in step to one line by piping the Master Password to it:</p> \n<p><code>gpg -q --decrypt password.enc | op signin example</code></p> \n<p>To automate all this, though, you can get the Master Password from a secure storage location and pipe it to sign in. A HashiCorp vault is a good place to securely store the account���s Master Password. I���m using GPG in this example, but you can use KMS or something else that you���re comfortable with ��� just avoid <code>echo</code>. ����</p> \n<h2 id=\"start-fetchin-those-audit-events\">Start fetchin��� those audit events</h2> \n<p>Now that we have our session token, we can start getting some audit events. Create a script that���s run by a job scheduler such as cron at regular intervals (every 10 minutes should suffice). That script needs to:</p> \n<img src=\"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/splunk/op-list-events-dog.png\" alt=\"op list events Dog\" title=\"op list events Dog\" style=\"max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;\" /> \n<ol> \n <li>Create the session like we just did above.</li> \n <li>Read the last processed event ID from disk.</li> \n <li>Fetch events newer than that ID.</li> \n <li>Send the events to Splunk.</li> \n <li>Save the latest event ID to disk.</li> \n</ol> \n<p>To do this, we���ll be working with JSON, so <a href=\"https://stedolan.github.io/jq/\">JQ</a> is a good idea if you���re working with bash; you could also use a scripting language that supports JSON, such as Python or Ruby.</p> \n<p>You can fetch up to 100 events newer than $ID. To fetch them:</p> \n<p><code>op list events $ID newer</code></p> \n<p>To make sure you get all the events, you���ll need to run that until nothing is returned, since only 100 events are returned each time. This command will return a JSON array of event objects like this:</p> \n<div class=\"highlight\">\n <pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-json\" data-lang=\"json\"><span class=\"p\">{</span>\n<span class=\"nt\">\"eid\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"mi\">392879</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n<span class=\"nt\">\"time\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"2018-01-23T15:50:49Z\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n<span class=\"nt\">\"actorUuid\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"YJTZ3RWWFRBNTF4M2YEEY3EPOQ\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n<span class=\"nt\">\"action\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"join\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n<span class=\"nt\">\"objectType\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"gm\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n<span class=\"nt\">\"objectUuid\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"hd22y2bob6qdpap2ge6d7nn4yy\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n<span class=\"nt\">\"auxInfo\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"A\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n<span class=\"nt\">\"auxUUID\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"YJTZ3RWWFRBNTF4M2YEEY3EPOQ\"</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<p>You can send all of the events in the array to Splunk at this point by using something like the <a href=\"https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/SplunkLight/7.0.2/GettingStarted/GettingdataintoSplunkLightusingLinux\">Splunk universal forwarder</a>.</p> \n<p>Next, take the <code>eid</code> of the first object in that array and save it to disk so it can be used for the next fetch. If the array from <code>op list events</code> is empty, it means there are no newer events, and you���re done here ��� for now.</p> \n<h2 id=\"get-alerts-about-important-actions-in-your-team\">Get alerts about important actions in your team</h2> \n<p>Earlier I mentioned one such handy use for Splunk with 1Password Business would be to see when someone is added to the Owners group. To do this, you would find an event in the Activity Log that has:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>action: <code>join</code></li> \n <li>objectType: <code>gm</code> (Group Membership)</li> \n <li>objectUuid: your Owners group���s UUID, which you can get by opening <a href=\"https://start.1password.com/groups,\">https://start.1password.com/groups,</a> signing in, and clicking Owners, then copying the UUID from the end of the address bar in your browser.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Every audit event comes with a <code>actorUuid</code> field. It���s a great identifier, but when perusing, we have no idea who <code>YJTZ3RWWFRBNTF4M2YEEY3EPOQ</code> is. To fix this up, let���s upgrade our script a bit. Before we fetch events, let���s get a user list with <code>op list users</code>. This will get us all users on the account along with some basic information like their name and email address. With that we can process each event object, look up the user by UUID, then add more descriptive information for when we send things to Splunk.</p> \n<p>In this example case of sending an alert when someone is added to the Owners group, it���s probably nice to know who was added. The <code>auxUUID</code> field of the audit event will be the UUID of the user who was added to the group. You can do the same lookup that we did above for the actor. For many events, <code>auxUUID</code> will not be a user UUID, so make sure to fail gracefully there.</p> \n<p>Now that we���ve set things up, whenever Splunk finds an event matching this, it���ll be able to alert your sysadmins via Slack or another method and let them know that Lorraine added Bobby to the Owners group. From there, they can take action if they need to.</p> \n<img src=\"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/splunk/matching-event-slack.png\" alt=\"Matching event in Slack\" title=\"Matching event in Slack\" style=\"max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;\" /> \n<h2 id=\"try-it-out-and-tell-us-what-you-think\">Try it out and tell us what you think</h2> \n<p>When it comes down to it, sending your team���s 1Password activity to Splunk gives you one place to audit any administrative action your team has been taking in 1Password, alongside all the other tools your company uses.

I think you���re going to love 1Password 7.1 for Android.</p>\n<p>For this update, our Android team resolved to make it even easier for new 1Password customers to get started. That informed much of their work, and I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll agree when I say they absolutely met their goals. With a slicker sign-up process and easier Emergency Kit creation, you can be up and running much faster.</p>\n<p>A lot of work has gone into this update, and as ever, you can see everything that&rsquo;s changed by reading the <a href=\"https://app-updates.agilebits.com/product_history/OPA4\">release notes</a>. There&rsquo;s a lot to whet the appetite in there, and I wanted to pick out a few of the biggest changes that we&rsquo;re really proud to bring to 1Password for Android.</p>\n<h2 id=\"start-your-1password-membership-with-google-play\">Start your 1Password membership with Google Play</h2>\n<p>If you install 1Password from the Google Play Store, you probably want your membership to be taken care of there, too. By bringing 1Password memberships to the Google Play Store, we&rsquo;ve made it quicker and easier to get started when you first install 1Password.</p>\n<section class=\"app-box android\">\n<div class=\"details\">\n<h3>Try it out</h3>\n<p>Signing up for a 1Password membership has never been easier, and the process even fits into a GIF!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"screenshot\">\n<div style=\"text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1.3em;\">\n<div style=\"margin: auto; display: inline-block; max-width: 100%;\">\n<div style='max-width: 100%; width: 300.05px; position: relative; padding-bottom: 200.01666666666665%;'>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/opa71/google-play.gif' alt='Image showing the 1Password membership signup process via Google Play' title='Image showing the 1Password membership signup process via Google Play' width='300.05px' class='' style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0;\"/>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</section>\n<h2 id=\"generate-and-save-your-emergency-kit-during-sign-up\">Generate and save your Emergency Kit during sign-up</h2>\n<p>Speaking of the sign-up process, wouldn&rsquo;t it be great if you could generate and save your Emergency Kit right after you create your account? It really would, so we&rsquo;ve flicked the switch and now you don&rsquo;t have to go back and generate it afterwards.</p>\n<p>Generating an Emergency Kit during sign-up means there&rsquo;s less chance you could find yourself without one when you need it most.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tag-all-the-things\">Tag all the things</h2>\n<p>For many people, tags are crucial for organizing their passwords, and with 1Password 7.1 for Android, you can tag all the things right from your phone or tablet. You can now create, edit, rename, and remove tags, and you can even nest tags to take your password organization to the next level.</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s great news for the tag-ninjas among you, and managing passwords on Android devices has never been so much fun. I know I can���t wait to get tagging!</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/opa71/tags.png' alt='Screenshots showing nested tagging' title='Screenshots showing nested tagging' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<h2 id=\"enjoy-one-time-passwords-without-the-hassle\">Enjoy one-time passwords without the hassle</h2>\n<p>We feel strongly about the importance of one-time passwords, but we also know that entering a password and then switching to another app to get a code is no fun. With 1Password 7.1 for Android, that frustration is a thing of the past.</p>\n<p>Now, when you Autofill a password, the one-time password for that account will be automatically copied to your clipboard. Just paste it into the web page or app, and you&rsquo;re good to go. After 30 seconds, the code is removed from your clipboard.</p>\n<h2 id=\"some-honorable-mentions\">Some honorable mentions</h2>\n<p>There���s a ton of work gone into this release, and I wanted to highlight some of the great changes that have been made. Other notable improvements include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Category names and item templates are now localized for those with 1Password.com accounts.</li>\n<li>Autofill now automatically syncs the latest changes from your other devices. You don���t need to open 1Password to sync.</li>\n<li>You can now use Autofill to sign in to websites in the stable version of Firefox.</li>\n<li>It���s now easier than ever to move items between vaults.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"coming-to-an-android-device-near-you\">Coming to an Android device near you</h2>\n<p>We&rsquo;re rolling out 1Password 7.1 for Android this week as a free update for all 1Password customers. Once it&rsquo;s available for your device, you can <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.agilebits.onepassword\">download the new update</a> from Google Play to enjoy all of the fantastic improvements I&rsquo;ve mentioned above.</p>\n<p>I hope you love using 1Password 7.1 for Android as much as our Android team loved building it for you. As always, we would love to hear your feedback on the <a href=\"https://discussions.agilebits.com/categories/1password-android\">1Password Support forum</a>.</p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 12 Feb 2019 10:00:00 +0000","feedId":10468,"bgimg":"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/opa71/header.png","linkMd5":"b07fc3f880bd5b5dfad6c1f276a475c6","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn10@2020_5/2020/08/25/00-54-52-504_a863eeacc3ac3c4e.webp","destWidth":2080,"destHeight":800,"sourceBytes":29744,"destBytes":33880,"author":"Oliver Haslam","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/opa71/header.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn10@2020_5/2020/08/25/00-54-52-504_a863eeacc3ac3c4e.webp","https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/opa71/google-play.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn84@2020_3/2020/08/25/00-55-08-900_85c703b94a43860e.webp","https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/opa71/tags.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn17@2020_4/2020/08/25/00-54-59-032_53ceda20e3d55a92.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598316891416},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:54:51","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:54:51","title":"Keeping your family safe from online scams","link":"https://blog.1password.com/family-scam-safety/","description":"\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2020/family-scams/header.png' class='webfeedsFeaturedVisual' alt='Keeping your family safe from online scams' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p class=\"introduction\">People all over the world are adapting to a new normal: working from home, taking online classes, and getting together with family over video chat. As we adjust to a more virtual way of life, it���s more important than ever to use the internet safely at home.</p>\n<p>To help, we���ve looked into how scammers are taking advantage of the situation and have put together some tips to help you protect yourself.</p>\n<h2 id=\"phishing-scams-are-on-the-up\">Phishing scams are on the up</h2>\n<p>With <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/mar/29/coronavirus-social-disease-fraudsters-adapt-old-scams\">3% of all global spam</a> now estimated to be coronavirus-related, with many messages impersonating reputable, global organizations like the World Health Organization and the United Nations. These phishing emails are designed to trick you into clicking malicious links or attachments by claiming to direct you to information about the virus, or even direct you to places to buy masks, cures, or tests.</p>\n<h2 id=\"check-all-messages-carefully\">Check all messages carefully</h2>\n<p>The best way to protect yourself against phishing is to vet messages thoroughly ��� even if they appear to come from a reputable organization or someone you know. Don���t click any suspicious links or attachments, and if you���re unsure, call the sender or message them directly to check. If the email is from a company or organization, visit the sender���s website directly to find their contact information.</p>\n<p>Be especially wary of emails and SMS messages that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ask you to click a link or sign in to an account</li>\n<li>Ask you to share any kind of personal or sensitive information</li>\n<li>Offer tests or cures</li>\n<li>Appear to be selling masks</li>\n<li>Claim to be acting for the local authority, saying they need contact details or other sensitive information in case of emergency</li>\n<li>Link to websites that offer government-funded support or aid</li>\n<li>Encourage you to sign up for health-related news, information, or alerts</li>\n<li>Threaten to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/mar/29/coronavirus-social-disease-fraudsters-adapt-old-scams\">reveal secrets about you</a> or infect your family</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This isn���t an exhaustive list by any means, but it gives you an idea of what to look out for. Here���s some more detailed information on <a href=\"https://blog.1password.com/what-is-phishing-and-how-can-you-protect-yourself/\">how to spot a phishing scam</a>. Make sure you report phishing attempts to the organisation or person the scammer was impersonating so that they can take steps to prevent future attempts.</p>\n<p>And, if you fall victim to a phishing scam, don���t be too hard on yourself. These scams use powerful social engineering tactics and it only takes a momentary lapse in concentration to fall for one.</p>\n<h2 id=\"were-signing-up-to-more-online-services\">We���re signing up to more online services</h2>\n<p>As more of us are told to stay home, we���re looking for new ways to work, keep in touch with families, and keep ourselves entertained. Last week, <a href=\"https://www.thedrum.com/news/2020/03/25/what-s-next-houseparty-the-social-video-app-the-social-distancing-age\">2 million people downloaded</a> Houseparty, a social networking service that enables group video chat. Zoom has seen daily users <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/zoom-microsoft-cloud-usage-are-rocketing-during-coronavirus-pandemic-new-data-show-2020-03-30\">more than quadruple</a> over the past 30 days, while Microsoft says cloud usage has <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/zoom-microsoft-cloud-usage-are-rocketing-during-coronavirus-pandemic-new-data-show-2020-03-30\">grown nearly 800%</a>.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2020/family-scams/video-chat-google-trends.png' alt='Google Trends data shows more people are searching for video chat software' title='Google Trends data shows more people are searching for video chat software' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>A lot of us are also leaning on technology to help with homeschooling, or to keep kids occupied. Duolingo, the language learning app, has seen a <a href=\"https://www.post-gazette.com/business/tech-news/2020/03/15/Duolingo-coronavirus-COVID-19-spike-in-online-gaming-streaming-in-China/stories/202003090111\">200% increase in test-taking activity</a>, for example. While fitness influencer, Joe Wicks, has had almost a million tune in to his live YouTube fitness classes.</p>\n<p>This in itself isn���t a problem, as long as you���re careful about the apps and services you access.</p>\n<h2 id=\"vet-apps-and-software-carefully\">Vet apps and software carefully</h2>\n<p>Be wary that scammers may be looking to fill demand by creating fake pages or apps designed to capture your personal information and login details. To stay safe:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Check whether the permissions apps are asking for are reasonable, or whether they���re trying to access more than they need.</li>\n<li>Download apps through official stores and marketplaces. It���s usually safer than downloading them straight from the internet.</li>\n<li>When trying a new tool, visit the website directly and download it from there.</li>\n<li>Do a little research. Check out app store reviews, do a quick search online, and ask for opinions on social media. If there���s a major concern with an app, people are likely talking about it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Also, take the time to set up parental controls before letting kids loose. Not only will you prevent them from inadvertently making costly in-app purchases, but you can also limit what information they can share and who with.</p>\n<h2 id=\"and-as-always-practice-good-password-habits\">And, as always, practice good password habits</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Use strong, unique passwords for every service you sign up to. So, if your login details are stolen, they can���t be used to try and access other services or accounts.</li>\n<li>Spend some time updating old passwords so that they���re all strong and unique.</li>\n<li>Don���t share passwords using insecure methods like email or instant messenger. The safest way is to share them using a password manager.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"secure-your-home-network\">Secure your home network</h2>\n<p>Your router controls which devices can access to your home WiFi, and when set up correctly, stops anyone from accessing your network that shouldn���t be. As more of our everyday lives are happening online, now is also a good time to make sure it���s set up correctly. To get started:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Check that your <a href=\"https://blog.1password.com/5-quick-tips-for-smart-home-security/\">Wi-Fi network is set up securely</a></li>\n<li>If you���re using the default password for your home router, change it to a strong, unique password of at least 20 characters and save it in a <a href=\"https://support.1password.com/create-share-vaults/\">shared vault</a>, so everyone at home can access it securely.</li>\n<li>Switch to the more secure <a href=\"https://blog.1password.com/how-to-stay-safe-on-public-wi-fi/\">Wi-Fi Protected Access II (WPA2)</a> protocol if you haven&rsquo;t already.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The best way to protect yourself and your family online is to stay vigilant. Everytime you open a new message, pause and question it. If something looks too good to be true, it probably is.</p>\n<section class=\"c-call-to-action-box c-call-to-action-box--yellow c-call-to-action-box--background-author c-call-to-action-box--background-author-yellow\">\n<div class=\"c-call-to-action-box__author\">\n<img src=\"https://blog.1password.com/img/authors/emilymarchant.png\" class=\"c-call-to-action-box__author-image c-call-to-action-box__author-image--yellow\" alt=\"Emily Marchant\"/>\n</div>\n<div class=\"c-call-to-action-box__content\">\n<h3 class=\"c-call-to-action-box__title c-call-to-action-box__title--yellow\">Not using 1Password yet?</h3>\n<div class=\"c-call-to-action-box__text c-call-to-action-box__text--yellow\">\nTry 1Password today and keep your family safe online.\n</div>\n<a href=\"https://1password.com/sign-up/\" class=\"c-call-to-action-box__link-href c-call-to-action-box__link-href--stacked c-call-to-action-box__link-href--yellow\" data-on=\"click\" data-event-category=\"CTA\" data-event-action=\"call-to-action-button\">\nGet 30 days FREE\n</a>\n</div>\n</section>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 01 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":10468,"bgimg":"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2020/family-scams/header.png","linkMd5":"f585d5aab848b280092f7c54e55c92a8","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn74@2020_1/2020/08/25/00-54-54-914_4bff1504a0309d87.webp","destWidth":2080,"destHeight":800,"sourceBytes":108077,"destBytes":78342,"author":"Emily Marchant","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2020/family-scams/header.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn74@2020_1/2020/08/25/00-54-54-914_4bff1504a0309d87.webp","https://blog.1password.com/posts/2020/family-scams/video-chat-google-trends.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn13@2020_1/2020/08/25/00-54-59-924_09787127c316615f.webp","https://blog.1password.com/img/authors/emilymarchant.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn7@2020_1/2020/08/25/00-55-02-595_7b7ff396d27aba56.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598316891414},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:54:51","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:54:51","title":"Getting 1Password 7 ready for the Mac App Store","link":"https://blog.1password.com/getting-1password-7-ready-for-the-mac-app-store/","description":"\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/opm7-mas/header.png' class='webfeedsFeaturedVisual' alt='Getting 1Password 7 ready for the Mac App Store' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p class=\"introduction\">1Password 7 has been in beta for 6 weeks now and the feedback has been fantastic. We are getting close to the official release date and have begun final preparations, including submitting 1Password 7 to the Mac App Store. ����</p>\n<p>When 1Password 7 is released it will be available from the Mac App Store as well as our website, and will be available as both a subscription and a standalone license.</p>\n<p>When adding 1Password 7 to the Mac App Store we needed to answer the following two questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Should it be a new app?</li>\n<li>Should it support both subscriptions and licenses?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ultimately we decided that 1Password 7 will be a new app in the Mac App Store, and available only as a subscription. I know that many of you will be curious about this, so I wanted to share with you why we decided on this approach.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mac-app-store-and-upgrades\">Mac App Store and upgrades</h2>\n<p>The Mac App Store is one of the most convenient ways to purchase apps for your Mac. You can purchase with confidence, pay quickly in your local currency, and updates happen automatically. Overall it is a pretty sweet experience.</p>\n<p>The App Store, for all it does well, struggles mightily when a paid upgrade is introduced because it does not allow developers to charge for an update to an existing app.</p>\n<p>When considering a paid upgrade, developers have two choices: they can re-use their existing app or submit a new one. Both have their pros and cons.</p>\n<h2 id=\"re-using-an-existing-app\">Re-using an existing app</h2>\n<p>Developers are very creative and one approach that some have used to introduce paid upgrades is to re-use their existing app and offer an In-App Purchase to make the upgraded features available.</p>\n<p>We actually went ahead and gave this an honest, if short-lived, try. Very quickly it became apparent that this would lead to a complete mess of spaghetti code as we tried to encapsulate new features. Worse yet, any significant UI updates (including the many we have in 1Password 7) were next to impossible to add as we���d have to keep the old UI around as well. Ultimately this proved infeasible and all my devs threatened to mutiny. ����</p>\n<h2 id=\"submitting-a-new-app\">Submitting a new app</h2>\n<p>A new app avoids these issues, allowing us to keep our code base clean and my developers happy. It comes at a price though.</p>\n<p>Introducing a new app means that everyone who wants the upgraded version needs to go back to the Mac App Store, find this new version, and download it.</p>\n<p>We���ve done this before with 1Password 4 for iOS, and have the scars to prove it. Thousands of customers were confused when trying to update because their 1Password 3 app claimed to be up-to-date. To this day we have customers on 1Password 3 who do not realize a new version is out.</p>\n<p>To be quite honest, one of the main reasons we haven���t had a paid upgrade on the Mac side for all these years is that we were dreading the pain this would cause us and our customers. However the time has come to bite the bullet and have a paid upgrade.</p>\n<p>To avoid this pain in the future, this will be the last time we will be submitting a new app to the App Store. To make that possible, 1Password 7 will only be available as a subscription in the Mac App Store.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mac-app-store-for-subscriptions-only\">Mac App Store for subscriptions only</h2>\n<p>1Password subscriptions are eligible for free upgrades, meaning we can keep the same app in the App Store and seamlessly upgrade everyone to the new version as it comes out. This is just one of many the reasons <a href=\"https://blog.agilebits.com/2017/07/13/why-we-love-1password-memberships/\">why we love memberships</a>.</p>\n<p>If we were to sell standalone licenses in the Mac App Store we would have these same problems all over again when 1Password 8 is released. Ultimately this is why we decided not to sell licenses through the Mac App Store.</p>\n<p>While still tough, this decision was easier to make as people looking for licenses will be able to download 1Password 7 directly from our website. I know this isn���t ideal for those who love the Mac App Store and prefer to purchase standalone licenses and I apologize for that. But overall I believe this was the correct decision to make.</p>\n<p>I���ll be out at WWDC in a few weeks and would be more than happy to talk further if you have questions or are facing similar decisions with your own apps.</p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 10 May 2018 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":10468,"bgimg":"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/opm7-mas/header.png","linkMd5":"fc7db8f354baaf5a51ec87bbf1e73d20","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn73@2020_3/2020/08/25/00-54-56-140_bfa6ae4befe18e18.webp","destWidth":1030,"destHeight":387,"sourceBytes":84158,"destBytes":41802,"author":"Jeff Shiner","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/opm7-mas/header.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn73@2020_3/2020/08/25/00-54-56-140_bfa6ae4befe18e18.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598316891418},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:54:51","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:54:51","title":"Immutable Australian Future Wave","link":"https://blog.1password.com/immutable-australian-future-wave/","description":"\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/rbm-5-review/header.png' class='webfeedsFeaturedVisual' alt='Immutable Australian Future Wave' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p class=\"introduction\">In September, Matt and Michael Fey (Roo) launched Random but Memorable, a security advice podcast.

I was interested to hear Matt and Roo discuss the different ways that they maintain their security online, including only using trusted sources like PayPal or Apple Pay, rather than entering credit card numbers into random websites. It&rsquo;s something I could be better at, and I appreciated the reminder.</p>\n<p>My favorite part of each podcast is always hearing directly from our customers. I love to learn how different people are using 1Password and what areas they���ve love to see us improve, change, or grow. This week���s question was about archiving old information like expired login, passport, and credit card items. Like Roo, I tend to be a bit of a pack rat, but I don���t want old information cluttering up my main vault. The trick is to create a separate vault for all your archived items and remove it from <a href=\"https://support.1password.com/all-vaults/\">All Vaults</a>. I&rsquo;ll be doing this myself when I get around to my annual fall cleaning.</p>\n<p>The bulk of the episode featured a chat with our friend Troy Hunt of <a href=\"https://haveibeenpwned.com/\">Have I Been Pwned</a> who is always entertaining and informative. Troy talks about password security in a way that&rsquo;s accessible to people at all levels. He���s passionate about what he does, and he wants to help people make the right choices to keep their data safe. And this week I also learned that password reuse was actually the catalyst for Troy starting Have I Been Pwned!</p>\n<p>Their conversation focused on how the view towards passwords and authentication has changed over the years. Authentication isn���t always black and white. There are gradients, and you have to account for the human element. Troy offers some excellent insight into how this impacts password security and how things don���t always go as planned when there are real people involved.</p>\n<p>To get your question on the show, send <a href=\"https://twitter.com/1Password\">@1Password</a> a tweet using the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ask1password\">#ask1Password</a> hashtag.</p>\n<p>Subscribe in <a href=\"https://overcast.fm/itunes1435486599/random-but-memorable\">Overcast</a>, <a href=\"https://pca.st/43AW\">Pocket Casts</a>, or <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/random-but-memorable/id1435486599?mt=2\">iTunes</a>, and please rate and review us on iTunes.</p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 09 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":10468,"bgimg":"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/rbm-5-review/header.png","linkMd5":"807b39b47b864cc9f6e4878e99bfb89f","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn73@2020_1/2020/08/25/00-54-54-229_ba292f3e75001cd6.webp","destWidth":2080,"destHeight":800,"sourceBytes":254718,"destBytes":108656,"author":"Sarah Brown","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/rbm-5-review/header.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn73@2020_1/2020/08/25/00-54-54-229_ba292f3e75001cd6.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598316891417},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:54:51","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:54:51","title":"How strong should your Master Password be?

For World Password Day we���d like to know' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p class=\"introduction\">Just how strong should a 1Password Master Password be? We recommend that Master Passwords be generated using our wordlist generator using passwords that are four words long. This gets you something like ���napery turnip speed adept���.</p>\n<p>Among other things, this gives you the chance to learn new words. My dictionary has now informed me that ���napery��� means household linens such as table cloths and napkins. But let me move on from obscure vocabulary to asking about Master Password strength: What we know about Master Password strength, what we would like to know about it, and how can we get expert password crackers to help us learn?</p>\n<p>That���s why we are announcing a password cracking challenge to be managed by Bugcrowd with cash money rewards. First prize earns $8192, second prize is half of that, and third prize is half again. The race <del>will begin</del> has begun at noon Eastern Time on World Password Day, May 3, 2018. For those who want to jump right to the contest details, without reading the rest of this, you can head right over to our <a href=\"https://bugcrowd.com/agilebits\">Bugcrowd brief</a> or to <a href=\"https://github.com/agilebits/crackme\">our description</a>. The challenge <a href=\"https://github.com/agilebits/crackme/blob/master/password-day-2018.json\">hashes/keys are now available</a>.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/world-password-day/cracking-prizes.png' alt='Prizes' title='Prizes' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<h2 id=\"what-is-your-master-password-for\">What is your Master Password for?</h2>\n<p>Your Master Password is your defense against someone who manages to steal your encrypted 1Password data from your own machines. Your data on our machines is also protected by your <a href=\"https://support.1password.com/secret-key-security/\">Secret Key</a>, making Master Password guessing futile. Unlike a human usable password, your Secret Key is completely unguessable, and that is what makes what is stored on 1Password.com uncrackable.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/world-password-day/secret-key.png' alt='Sample Secret Key' title='Sample Secret Key' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>But your Secret Key does not protect you if data is stolen from your own devices because your Secret Key is stored on your own devices. Likewise, our <a href=\"https://blog.agilebits.com/2018/04/25/multi-factor-authentication-in-1password/\">Multi-Factor Authentication</a> only defends against attempts to connect to our systems. MFA doesn���t protect you from data acquired from your own machines. So when it comes to keeping 1Password data stored on your own machine from prying eyes, your Master Password is your defense. It needs to be as strong as you can reasonably use and it must be unique.</p>\n<p>Consider Molly (a not all that bright dog), who has a Master Password of ���RabbitHunter#1���. She also has some very important Login items, such as her PawPal account within 1Password. Now suppose that Mr Talk (the neighbor���s cat) has contrived to steal data off of Molly���s laptop, including her encrypted 1Password data.</p>\n<p>Mr Talk will set up automated password guessing software to make many thousands of guesses per second. We can slow that down with PBKDF2, but Mr Talk is doing everything on his own machines and is not connecting to any of our systems. That is why MFA doesn���t do Molly any good in these circumstances. Now if Mr Talk has some expertise in password cracking and is willing to dedicate some computer power to this, he might be able to crack that Master Password within a few hours or maybe it would take a week. However long that is is how much time Molly has to change her PawPal password and other passwords that she keeps in 1Password.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/world-password-day/patty.png' alt='Dog holding stick representing Master Password' title='Dog holding stick representing Master Password' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>Let���s suppose that Mr Talk got Patty���s data as well. But Patty (a clever dog) used our Strong Password Generator and ended up with a Master Password of ���saddle harass mod gunk���. Even if Mr Talk dedicated enormous amounts of computer resources to this, it would take decades or centuries to crack that. So Patty remains safe because she used a strong, randomly generated Master Password.</p>\n<p>Again, for Mr Talk to have a whisker of a chance of cracking any of these passwords, he���d need to get data directly from Patty and Molly���s system, which will also provide Mr Talk with their Secret Keys. Mr Talk would not be able to launch such an attack from data acquired from our systems.</p>\n<h2 id=\"reducing-the-guesswork-by-measuring-the-guessing-work\">Reducing the guesswork by measuring the guessing work</h2>\n<p>How did I come up with saying ���hours to a week��� for Molly���s and ���decades to centuries��� for Patty���s? I did so with a lot of guesswork. But we���d like to improve on that guess work, and the way to do that is to invite (incentivize) expert crackers to try to crack passwords and find out just how much work they have to put into it.</p>\n<p>Now if my guess about decades is anywhere on target for the four word password, that is simply too large of a challenge. So we are presenting a number of keys derived from three word passwords from our password generator. We are also <a href=\"https://github.com/agilebits/crackme\">posting all the details</a> about how they were generated and the wordlist used.)</p>\n<p>We are also simplifying some of the odd details of our key derivation function to focus solely on the 100,000 rounds of PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256. This will make it easier for participants to get set up without really affecting the result of what we are trying to measure with this exercise.</p>\n<h2 id=\"we-want-winners\">We want winners</h2>\n<p>We want people to win the prizes, and we want people going into this to know that we want people to win. Otherwise we wouldn���t get participants to put in the effort that we are trying to measure.</p>\n<p>So let me remind everyone again, the challenges that we have created here do not have the protection of the Secret Key and they are using Master Passwords that are at the weaker end of what we recommend. This contest simulates attacking only one single component of 1Password security.</p>\n<h2 id=\"knowing-your-system-is-a-good-thing\">Knowing your system is a good thing</h2>\n<p>It���s been nearly seven years since we helped revive the notion of wordlist-based passwords with our article <a href=\"https://blog.agilebits.com/2011/06/21/toward-better-master-passwords/\">Toward Better Master Passwords</a>. And one of the many virtues of generated passwords is that they remain strong even if the attacker knows how they were generated. So with that in mind, we are also <a href=\"https://github.com/agilebits/crackme\">publishing the source</a> used to generate the challenges.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-long-until-we-have-answers\">How long until we have answers?</h2>\n<p>If we knew how much effort it takes to crack a three word password, we wouldn���t be giving away money to find out, would we? We also don���t know what kinds of resources people will throw at the problem. If people or teams dedicate fleets of hashing rigs at the problem they will find things more quickly than someone who just uses a couple of more ordinary computers.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/world-password-day/mining-titan.png' alt='Mining Rig' title='Mining Rig' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<h3 id=\"money-is-time\">Money is time</h3>\n<p>It may be more useful to ask about the cost of cracking a password versus how much time it takes. In any particular cracking attempt there will be some combination of fixed costs and variable costs ranging from developing the expertise and equipment depreciation to the cost of the electricity used to run and cool the machines. We want to develop an estimate that considers the total cost. So we hope that the challenge takes long enough that the results will show a useful mixture of fixed and variable costs.</p>\n<p>We���ve also structured the contest as a race. The first to find a password will earn <del>$8192</del> $12288, while the second place prize is <del>$2048</del> $8192. The third place prize is <del>$1024</del> $6144, And the fourth place prize is $4096.</p>\n<p>My own wild guess is that it could take anywhere between $250 and $2000 worth of effort to crack one of these three word passwords from our list, and so we���re offering a first prize that is double the higher end guess. This way it should be worth their time to switch some of their coin mining rigs over to password cracking.</p>\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> Nearly three months into the contest it is clear that I underestimated the cost. We have increased the prizes twice by now (July 26, 2018), and are still not certain that it is enough. <a href=\"https://discussions.agilebits.com/discussion/89318/world-password-day-cracking-challenge#latest\">Join us and participants in the forums</a> for discussion of updates in cost estimates and how we may ensure that this challenge is worthwhile to participations.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-now\">What now?</h2>\n<p>If you would like to participate, head over to Bugcrowd for <a href=\"https://bugcrowd.com/agilebits\">the official rules</a> and to get set up with them if you are not already a Bugcrowd researcher, as all submissions will go through them.

This year the journey was���shorter. In fact, it was just a few steps to the couch for the first remote WWDC. Amidst all the challenges facing the world, Apple did what they do best: think different.</p>\n<p>Credit to Apple ��� they���ve exceeded our expectations for a remote WWDC. The keynote was entertaining and informative. The sessions are clear and concise. And even the labs are great, with one-on-one time with Apple developers from the comfort of our homes.</p>\n<p>While we���ve really missed hanging out with everyone in San Jose, this is easily a WWDC for the record books. Here are a few highlights from our week as WWDC draws to a close.</p>\n<h2 id=\"macos-this-one-goes-to-11-\">macOS: This one goes to 11 �����������</h2>\n<p>I immediately installed the beta of macOS 11 Big Sur, and it���s no Big Sur-prise that I���ve been loving it ever since. The new design language, SwiftUI-based Control Center and Notification Center, and brand-new Safari are all incredibly exciting. And I can���t wait to get my hands on a Developer Transition Kit for the move to Apple silicon.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2020/wwdc-2020/Big_Sur_Icon.png' alt='Colorful Big Sur Icons' title='Colorful Big Sur Icons' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p><em>macOS Big Sur introduces a new icon design language. Here���s a sneak peak of 1Password���s new icon in both light and dark modes, compared to its current icon.</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"ios-and-ipados\">iOS and iPadOS</h2>\n<p>Apple continues to move iOS and iPadOS forward in some wonderful ways. I���m delighted by the improved home screen using Widgets and the App Library, improvements to Siri and Dictation, and Safari���s new Password Monitoring and Privacy Reports ��� both things that are near and dear to our core beliefs. Also, phone calls won���t take over my whole screen anymore!</p>\n<h2 id=\"1password-runs-well-on-the-betas\">1Password runs well on the betas</h2>\n<p>We know you���re just as excited to try out Apple���s new operating systems, and may even be considering the public betas when they���re available next month. I���m happy to report that 1Password runs really well on all developer betas: macOS 11 Big Sur, iOS 14, and iPadOS 14.</p>\n<p>In fact, we wanted to show you a little something. Part of being a good citizen of an app ecosystem is embracing the platform tools wherever possible. One of the benefits of our doing this over the years is that we sometimes get new functionality with little to no extra work.</p>\n<p>Take a look at how the new Scribble feature in iPadOS 14 works in the current version of 1Password.</p>\n<p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2020/wwdc-2020/Scribble-demo-1.png' alt='Colorful Big Sur Icons' title='Colorful Big Sur Icons' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2020/wwdc-2020/Scribble-demo-2.png' alt='Colorful Big Sur Icons' title='Colorful Big Sur Icons' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2020/wwdc-2020/Scribble-demo-3.png' alt='Colorful Big Sur Icons' title='Colorful Big Sur Icons' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n</p>\n<p>Handwriting a Title and a Note in a Secure Note item converts into regular typed text. We also wrote the note using Markdown syntax, which converted successfully into the text field, and then displayed as rich text when we were done editing. It just works���.</p>\n<p>\n<video class=\"round shadow\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; padding: 0;\"loop=\"loop\" playsinline=\"\" width=\"100%\" alt='' controls>\n<source src=\"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2020/wwdc-2020/scribble.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" />\n</video>\n</p>\n<h2 id=\"new-os-means-new-features\">New OS means new features</h2>\n<p>Scribble isn���t the only new thing we���re excited about. Our developers have been hard at work the past few days exploring the possibilities of what 1Password could do with some of the new features available to us, and I���d like to show you some of those ideas.</p>\n<p><strong>Widgets</strong></p>\n<p>Widgets in iOS, iPadOS, and macOS are incredibly useful for seeing key bits of information quickly. This week, we put our heads together and created a widget that provides a glanceable report of your Watchtower stats. The best part is nearly all the code is shared between iOS, iPadOS, and macOS thanks to SwiftUI.</p>\n<p>\n<video class=\"round shadow\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; padding: 0;\"loop=\"loop\" playsinline=\"\" width=\"100%\" alt='' controls>\n<source src=\"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2020/wwdc-2020/Widget-demo.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" />\n</video>\n</p>\n<p><em>The 1Password widget shows you Compromised Sites in its small size, and its medium size reports an entire Watchtower summary.

The team has put together an App Clip that creates a quick breach report from Watchtower ��� even without a 1Password membership. If anything comes up in the breach, you can download the rest of the app and start a free trial to improve your security with 1Password.</p>\n<p>\n<video class=\"round shadow\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; padding: 0;\"loop=\"loop\" playsinline=\"\" width=\"100%\" alt='' controls>\n<source src=\"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2020/wwdc-2020/app-clip.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" />\n</video>\n</p>\n<p><em>The 1Password App Clip lets you know when and where you&rsquo;ve had compromised accounts.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Safari Web Extensions</strong></p>\n<p>Ever since we released 1Password X, we���ve been asked one question time and again: When is it coming to Safari? Thanks to the introduction of Safari Web Extensions at WWDC20, we were able to get 1Password X mostly running in Safari in a few short hours.

Just try not to get too distracted playing around with it! ����</p>\n<h2 id=\"see-more-do-more\">See more, do more</h2>\n<p>After you���ve unlocked 1Password, your items will meet your eye in a cleaner format that���s designed to make it easier to find what you���re looking for at a glance.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/opa7.0/item-list.png' alt='List of items in 1Password 7' title='List of items in 1Password 7' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>And this beauty comes with power, as you can now perform actions on more than one item at once. Starting with a long press, you can select multiple items from your list and mark them as favourite, copy them to another vault, or delete them.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/opa7.0/multi-select.png' alt='Selecting multiple items from list' title='Selecting multiple items from list' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>When it���s time to switch to a different view of your items, the new bottom navigation makes it quicker and easier than ever. Favourites, Categories, and Tags are all within a single tap���s reach.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/opa7.0/bottom-navigation.png' alt='New bottom navigation bar' title='New bottom navigation bar' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>If you���re rocking multiple vaults with your 1Password membership, you can easily see which vault you currently have selected with the vault indicator at the top left.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/opa7.0/vault-icon.png' alt='Active vault icon displays in toolbar' title='Active vault icon displays in toolbar' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>Tapping on that icon reveals the updated vault switcher, allowing you to quickly switch between vaults with only a couple of taps.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/opa7.0/vault-switcher.png' alt='Vault switcher shown in navigation drawer' title='Vault switcher shown in navigation drawer' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<h2 id=\"its-all-in-the-details\">It���s all in the details</h2>\n<p>When you decide to view one of your items, you���ll see that we���re presenting those details in a whole new light too! We���ve updated the item detail view to highlight the most important details of your item, while organizing any additional information in an easily readable format.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/opa7.0/item-details.png' alt='Item details for Google account' title='Item details for Google account' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>Of course, we went way beyond skin-deep changes too. You can switch into edit mode and customize your item to include additional sections and fields. This is great for adding security questions and other important details that you need to remember. Better yet, you can now use the built-in QR code scanner to add one-time passwords to your Logins to enhance the security of your accounts.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/opa7.0/edit-mode-2fa.png' alt='Editing item details for Google account' title='Editing item details for Google account' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<h2 id=\"staying-alert\">Staying alert</h2>\n<p>I���m thrilled to say that Watchtower is now an integral part of <a href=\"https://1password.com/downloads/android/\">1Password 7 on Android</a>. Whether it���s compromised logins, vulnerable passwords, or even items that are expired or expiring soon, we���ve got you covered. A banner will display above your item details whenever there is a Watchtower alert, providing you with the necessary details and guiding you on any actions that you should take.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/opa7.0/watchtower-vulnerable-password.png' alt='Watchtower warning that password for Evernote account has compromised in a data breach' title='Watchtower warning that password for Evernote account has compromised in a data breach' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<h2 id=\"smart-passwords\">Smart passwords</h2>\n<p>When it comes time to choose a new password or update an existing one, the new and improved Strong Password Generator will help you create exactly the right one for your needs. The memorable password recipe is great for passwords that you���ll need to type out or read aloud over the phone. The PIN Code recipe will help you with bank cards or memberships that limit you to only using digits. And for everything else, you can choose random password to get the strongest possible password. In each case, the Strong Password Generator provides you with convenient options for tweaking the passwords as you see fit.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/opa7.0/strong-password-generator.png' alt='Strong Password Generator creating a word-based password' title='Strong Password Generator creating a word-based password' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<h2 id=\"document-all-the-things\">Document all the things</h2>\n<p>With 1Password memberships, you can use Document items to store important files for insurance, wills, taxes or anything else you might want to keep secure. 1Password 7 makes it even easier to do so by allowing you to upload files directly from your Android device. Grab a photo from your camera roll, a PDF from Google Drive, or just about anything else that you can think of.</p>\n<h2 id=\"and-much-more\">And much more</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fresh welcome and setup screen designs</li>\n<li>New setup flow helps you get started with Fingerprint Unlock and Autofill</li>\n<li>Use Autofill with 1Password in the <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.duckduckgo.mobile.android\">DuckDuckGo</a> and <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.brave.browser\">Brave</a> browsers</li>\n<li>Categories are now sorted with the most commonly used categories at the top</li>\n<li>OPVault is the default format for both Dropbox and local storage sync</li>\n<li>Use multiple URLs with Login items for a better filling experience</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"how-do-i-get-it\">How do I get it?</h2>\n<p>1Password 7 is available on Google Play as a free update for devices running Android 5 or later. If you���ve got automatic updates enabled (and we recommend that you do), you don���t need to do anything to receive this latest and greatest version of 1Password. Otherwise, head on over to Google Play and click that update button:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.agilebits.onepassword\">Download 1Password 7</a></p>\n<p>Don&rsquo;t worry if the update doesn&rsquo;t show up right away for you.

With <a href=\"https://1password.com/business/\">1Password Business</a>, we���ve added item usage reports, a new tool for you to see how the people on your team are using 1Password.</p> \n<h2 id=\"know-what-your-team-can-access\">Know what your team can access</h2> \n<img src=\"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/usage-reports/person-usage.png\" alt=\"Report generated for a user\" title=\"Report generated for a user\" style=\"max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;\" /> \n<p>An administrator or owner on your team can create a report for a team member to see what items they���ve used, how many vaults and items they have access to, and more. To create your first report for a team member:</p> \n<ol> \n <li><a href=\"https://start.1password.com/signin\">Sign in</a> to your business account on 1Password.com.</li> \n <li>Click People in the sidebar.</li> \n <li>Click the name of a team member, then click Create Usage Report below their name.</li> \n</ol> \n<p>We���ve designed reports to focus on the vaults that matter to you, so you���ll see items from shared vaults in a person���s report.</p> \n<h2 id=\"know-whats-being-used-in-your-vaults\">Know what���s being used in your vaults</h2> \n<img src=\"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/usage-reports/vault-usage.png\" alt=\"Report generated for a vault\" title=\"Report generated for a vault\" style=\"max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;\" /> \n<p>You can also create a report for a vault to see what people have been using in it. To create a report for a vault:</p> \n<ol> \n <li>Click <a href=\"https://start.1password.com/vaults\">Vaults</a> in the sidebar.</li> \n <li>Click the name of a vault, then click Create Usage Report below its name.</li> \n</ol> \n<p>The handy thing about creating a report for a vault is that you can see what has been used often in that vault. Sorting by item name gives you an organized list, and each item will be shown as a separate entry for each person who has used it.</p> \n<h2 id=\"know-what-to-do-when-someone-leaves-your-team\">Know what to do when someone leaves your team</h2> \n<img src=\"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/usage-reports/change-passwords.png\" alt=\"Case containing password to update\" title=\"Case containing password to update\" style=\"max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;\" /> \n<p>When someone leaves your team, you can <a href=\"https://support.1password.com/add-remove-team-members/#suspend-an-account-temporarily\">suspend their account</a> to revoke their access to vaults and items, then create a report to get an idea of what passwords you might need to change. Then you can click the item in the report and use 1Password to quickly <a href=\"https://support.1password.com/change-website-password/\">change the password</a>.</p> \n<p>Keeping passwords in a <a href=\"https://support.1password.com/create-share-vaults-teams\">shared vault</a> in your team means any changes made to them will be available to the people who can access that vault right away. Then you can change the password to keep those accounts secure, and through the magic of shared vaults, everyone who needs that password will automatically get the new one so they can use it right away.</p> \n<h2 id=\"start-using-reports\">Start using reports</h2> \n<p>Usage reports are centered on the best part of any company: the people. They focus on the vaults someone has access to, as well as important dates, like when they joined the team or last signed in. And the best part is only the admins and owners of your team know which items and websites your team is using: we can���t see any of that.</p> \n<p>The goal of reports is to help you make better judgments about whether Emmett or Lorraine really need to keep access to those potentially high-value resources. And if they don���t, you <a href=\"https://support.1password.com/create-share-vaults-teams\">change their access</a> to something that better suits them.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://support.1password.com/reports/\">Learn more about creating reports in 1Password Business</a></p> \n<p>This is only the beginning ��� we���d love your feedback on what else you���d like to see in the reports.

We are all worthy of support, encouragement, and happiness. Sometimes feeling okay is easier said than done, but by carving out a bit of time each day to focus on mental and physical health, we can work towards that reality together.</p>\n<p>Here at 1Password, a huge part of our culture is being positive and working to bring the wow factor to our customers ��� but to do that, we need to take time to recharge ourselves too. That���s why we encourage folks to get active during the day, and spend time doing things they love. Whether we���re coding amazing new features or helping answer questions from awesome users, it&rsquo;s a pretty sedentary job. Having activities outside of work ��� like going to the gym, yoga, a darts league, or squash ��� gets you moving, helps the body stay active, and feeds the brain. :)</p>\n<p>We also do a few things within 1Password to help keep people feeling connected. Sharing news of engagements, losses, small victories, and other personal stories helps to make us family. When one person celebrates, we all cheer, and when someone is suffering, we all offer support. Finding a group of folks that you can both work and share your life with is something special, and I&rsquo;m proud to be a part of it.</p>\n<p>I was recently asked if we had ever considered hiring someone with a mental illness. The idea that mental health could be just a checkbox on a list of qualities we look for in a candidate amazed me.

The sudden nature of this shift has meant IT teams are ill-prepared for the security implications of remote working.</p>\n<p>One such risk is shadow IT ��� the use of apps and services by employees without the knowledge or oversight of your IT team. In our recent look at the <a href=\"https://blog.1password.com/challenges-of-shadow-it/\">risks of shadow IT</a>, we saw that a remarkable 63.5% of workers had created at least one shadow IT account in the 12 months prior to our survey.</p>\n<p>Right now, the use of shadow IT is only likely to increase as people find new workflows to replace old ones that are suddenly unfit for purpose. And people will be all the more tempted by extended free trials offered in the spate of home-working caused by coronavirus. Even the simple act of having a face-to-face conversation needs an app now.</p>\n<p>Banning the use of shadow IT isn���t practical, and doing so could stifle productivity and innovation in your organization. People will always find a way around imposed limitations out of the commendable desire to get things done. In this post, we���ll look at how to mitigate the risks posed by shadow IT when working as a remote team.</p>\n<h2 id=\"risks-of-shadow-it\">Risks of shadow IT</h2>\n<p>Let���s quickly recap the risks posed by shadow IT. The nature of these risks doesn���t change due to remote working, particularly. But the risks become more relevant than ever as use of shadow IT increases in light of remote working.</p>\n<p><strong>You don���t know where your data is.</strong> If you don���t know what services your team are using, you don���t know where sensitive company data, or that of your customers, could be lurking. If one of those services is breached, you won���t know that data has been compromised.</p>\n<p><strong>You don���t know who has access.</strong> In the event someone leaves your company suddenly, it can be hard enough closing the work accounts you do know about, let alone the ones you don���t. Former employees could retain access to data to share with competitors.</p>\n<p><strong>Poor password practices can go unchecked.</strong> As people sign up for new accounts, they may use weak passwords or reuse old passwords. Credential surfing and <a href=\"https://blog.1password.com/how-to-protect-yourself-from-password-reuse-attacks/\">password reuse</a> are the most common ways attackers gain access to your confidential information.</p>\n<h2 id=\"reducing-those-risks\">Reducing those risks</h2>\n<p>Shadow IT sounds scary, but with a few common sense steps, you can reduce the use of necessary shadow IT, and mitigate the risks associated with the rest.</p>\n<p><strong>Cover the basics.</strong> When you work remotely, everyone is going to need a handful of basic services to get things done. Make sure you provide ways for your team to communicate in writing, video call, collaborate on documents, prioritize tasks and share information securely. If you already use an identity provider, choose tools that work with it so the team already has a means of securely signing in without creating their new passwords.</p>\n<p><strong>Be nimble and amenable.</strong> It���s not shadow IT if you know people are using it. Encourage people to share what tools they���re using. Existing policies that prohibit new services may be too stringent for newly remote teams. Investigate the tools people are using, and suggest better, safer alternatives where appropriate. Say yes rather than no to new tools where you can.</p>\n<p><strong>Encourage a culture of common sense.</strong> People will appreciate any leniency you can offer when it comes to IT tools, and will be prepared to meet you half-way when it comes to how they���re used. For most day-to-day communication and work, it may not be necessary to use or store sensitive company or customer data. You can let people know they���re free to use certain tools provided sensitive information isn���t shared.</p>\n<p><strong>Raise awareness about online security.</strong> Make sure your team is informed about <a href=\"https://blog.1password.com/remote-work-security-tips/\">online security when remote working</a>. They should know that online attacks and scam such as phishing and CEO fraud pose an increased threat at the moment. Everyone should know the importance of using strong, unique passwords and two-factor authentication wherever possible.</p>\n<p><strong>Use a password manager.</strong> Make sure everyone has access to a business password manager like 1Password that can create and store strong passwords. This means that if people do ever need to create an account, they can make sure it���s as safe as possible, and can easily access the credentials if they need to delete the account or update the password in future. Ideally, choose a password manager that allows secure sharing of passwords and other important information so people have the means to do this safely as the need arises ��� it almost certainly will.</p>\n<p><strong>Consider apps carefully.</strong> If it���s an option, always speak to your IT team before trying a new app. If you are ever tempted to use a new one, take care to choose a safe app from a reputable source. Download the app from a recognized app store if possible. Check what permissions the app needs, and avoid apps which ask for permissions that don���t make sense, or seem more invasive than they need to be.</p>\n<p><strong>Be a good work citizen.</strong> As an employee, reward the trust placed in you at this time by being careful which services you choose to use and how you choose to use them. Keep track of any services you use and share details with your IT team. Don���t share sensitive data outside of approved channels. Be sure to delete data, or replace it with dummy data, from any accounts you no longer need, closing or deleting the accounts themselves when you���re done.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heres-where-to-start\">Here&rsquo;s where to start</h2>\n<p>Perhaps the single-most important step you can take to mitigate the risks posed by Shadow IT is to make sure your team uses a password manager to create, store and share strong, unique passwords. We���ve made 1Password Business free to use for 6 months to help companies make the switch to remote working.</p>\n<section class=\"c-call-to-action-box c-call-to-action-box--background-author\">\n<div class=\"c-call-to-action-box__author\">\n<img src=\"https://blog.1password.com/img/authors/mattdavey.jpg\" class=\"c-call-to-action-box__author-image\" alt=\"Matt Davey\"/>\n</div>\n<div class=\"c-call-to-action-box__content\">\n<h3 class=\"c-call-to-action-box__title\">Get more security tips</h3>\n<div class=\"c-call-to-action-box__text\">\nSign up to our business security mailing list and get advice on running a secure, productive workplace delivered directly to your inbox.\n</div>\n<form accept-charset=\"UTF-8\" action=\"https://agilemail.createsend.com/t/r/s/ohlyduj/\" class=\"oneline\" data-event-category=\"Newsletter\" data-event-action=\"form-newsletter\" id=\"newsletterForm\" method=\"post\">\n<div id=\"hidden-fields\"><input name=\"utf8\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"���\"><input name=\"authenticity_token\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"B2cHFMPBG0KjOnROQ884zCYcI0afwrAx897/qCCfum0=\"></div>\n<input class=\"c-call-to-action-box__newsletter-email\" id=\"cm-ohlyduj-ohlyduj\" name=\"cm-ohlyduj-ohlyduj\" type=\"email\" placeholder=\"wendy@appleseed.com\">\n<input class=\"c-call-to-action-box__newsletter-button\" type=\"submit\" value=\"Sign up\">\n</form>\n</div>\n</section>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 08 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":10468,"bgimg":"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2020/remote-shadow-IT/header.png","linkMd5":"9fbe08df9860a1d8c0282a84ec93e1bc","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn5@2020_6/2020/08/25/00-54-51-607_49709fdf54113fe0.webp","destWidth":2080,"destHeight":800,"sourceBytes":35070,"destBytes":42668,"author":"Matt Davey","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2020/remote-shadow-IT/header.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn5@2020_6/2020/08/25/00-54-51-607_49709fdf54113fe0.webp","https://blog.1password.com/img/authors/mattdavey.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn60@2020_1/2020/08/25/00-55-04-936_81dfd9bc82da4099.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598316891414},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:54:51","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:54:51","title":"Introducing Travel Mode: Protect your data when crossing borders","link":"https://blog.1password.com/introducing-travel-mode-protect-your-data-when-crossing-borders/","description":"\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2017/travel-mode/header.png' class='webfeedsFeaturedVisual' alt='Introducing Travel Mode: Protect your data when crossing borders' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p class=\"introduction\">We often get inspired to create new features based on feedback from our customers. Earlier this month, our friends at Basecamp <a href=\"https://m.signalvnoise.com/basecamps-employee-handbook-is-public-356167dff126\">made their Employee Handbook public</a>. We were impressed to see they had a whole section about using 1Password, which included instructions for keeping work information off their devices when travelling internationally.</p>\n<p>We knew right away that we wanted to make it easier for everyone to follow this great advice. So we hunkered down and built Travel Mode.</p>\n<p>Travel Mode is a new feature we���re making available to <strong>everyone with a 1Password membership</strong>. It protects your 1Password data from unwarranted searches when you travel. When you turn on Travel Mode, every vault will be removed from your devices except for the ones marked ���safe for travel.��� All it takes is a single click to travel with confidence.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2017/travel-mode/activate.gif' alt='Activate travel mode animation' title='Activate travel mode animation' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>It���s important for me that my personal data be as secure and private as possible. I have data on my devices that���s ultimately a lot more sensitive than my personal data though. As one of the developers here at AgileBits I���m trusted with access to certain keys and services that we simply can���t take any risks with.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-it-works\">How it works</h2>\n<p>Let���s say I had an upcoming trip for a technology conference in San Jose. I hear the apples are especially delicious over there this time of year. :) Before Travel Mode, I would have had to sign out of all my 1Password accounts on all my devices. If I needed certain passwords with me, I had to create a temporary travel account. It was a lot of work and not worth it for most people.</p>\n<p>Now all I have to do is make sure any of the items I need for travel are in a single vault. I then sign in to my account on 1Password.com, mark that vault as ���safe for travel,��� and turn on Travel Mode in my profile. I unlock 1Password on my devices so the vaults are removed, and I���m now ready for my trip. Off I go from sunny Winnipeg to hopefully-sunnier San Jose, ready to cross the border knowing that my iPhone and my Mac no longer contain the vast majority of my sensitive information.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2017/travel-mode/travel-mode-backpack.png' alt='Backpack containing 1Password items' title='Backpack containing 1Password items' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>After I arrive at my destination, I can sign in again and turn off Travel Mode. The vaults immediately show up on my devices, and I���m back in business.</p>\n<h2 id=\"not-just-a-magic-trick\">Not just a magic trick</h2>\n<p>Your vaults aren���t just hidden; they���re completely removed from your devices <a href=\"https://support.1password.com/travel-mode\">as long as Travel Mode is on</a>. That includes every item and all your encryption keys. There are no traces left for anyone to find. So even if you���re asked to unlock 1Password by someone at the border, there���s no way for them to tell that Travel Mode is even enabled.</p>\n<p>In 1Password Teams, Travel Mode is even cooler. If you���re a team administrator, you have total control over which secrets your employees can travel with. You can turn Travel Mode on and off for your team members, so you can ensure that company information stays safe at all times.</p>\n<p>Travel Mode is going to change how you use 1Password. It���s already changed the way we use it. When we gave a sneak peek to our friends at Basecamp, here���s what their founder, David Heinemeier Hansson, had to say:</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2017/travel-mode/david-heinemeier-hansson.png' alt='David Heinemeier Hansson' title='David Heinemeier Hansson' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<blockquote>\n<p>International travel while maintaining your privacy (and dignity!) has become increasingly tough. We need better tools to help protect ourselves against unwarranted searches and the leakage of business and personal secrets. 1Password is taking a great step in that direction with their new Travel Mode. Bravo.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Travel Mode is available today, included in every <a href=\"https://1password.com/pricing\">1Password membership</a>. Give it a shot, and let us know how you travel with 1Password.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://support.1password.com/travel-mode\">Learn how to use Travel Mode</a> on our support site.</p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 18 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":10468,"bgimg":"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2017/travel-mode/header.png","linkMd5":"934f5c0be2b267046577969c9d2c7194","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn6@2020_3/2020/08/25/00-54-55-308_0a1ecf7417632cfc.webp","destWidth":1030,"destHeight":402,"sourceBytes":52955,"destBytes":21404,"author":"Rick Fillion","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2017/travel-mode/header.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn6@2020_3/2020/08/25/00-54-55-308_0a1ecf7417632cfc.webp","https://blog.1password.com/posts/2017/travel-mode/activate.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn43@2020_4/2020/08/25/00-55-03-387_9e4bb064f67e2876.webp","https://blog.1password.com/posts/2017/travel-mode/travel-mode-backpack.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn70@2020_5/2020/08/25/00-54-58-945_643b220b862313a3.webp","https://blog.1password.com/posts/2017/travel-mode/david-heinemeier-hansson.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn39@2020_4/2020/08/25/00-55-00-806_aab57adbe4746698.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598316891419},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:54:51","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:54:51","title":"Passwords, breaches, and data dumps: business tips from Troy Hunt","link":"https://blog.1password.com/passwords-breaches-data-dumps/","description":"\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/business-webinar-troyhunt/header.png' class='webfeedsFeaturedVisual' alt='Passwords, breaches, and data dumps: business tips from Troy Hunt' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p class=\"introduction\">We&rsquo;ve kicked off an exciting new webinar series, <a href=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/watch?v=6QppFBnu-Uo&amp;list=PLeXQRfNcE6-DKEwaj6hWes8ZU1iAQtp0v\">Essentials of Business Security</a>, designed to help your businesses stay safe online.</p>\n<p>In the first installment Matt talks with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/troyhunt\">Troy Hunt</a>, a longtime friend of 1Password and the founder of <a href=\"https://haveibeenpwned.com/\">Have I Been Pwned</a>. Troy created this site to help people find out if their passwords have been leaked on the Internet, making him an expert on password-related security issues.</p>\n<div class=\"embed embed-16x9\">\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6QppFBnu-Uo\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe><br>\n</div>\n<p>Matt and Troy covered four key points in the webinar that will help you protect your business and employees.</p>\n<h2 id=\"password-habits-and-standards-have-changed\">Password habits and standards have changed</h2>\n<p>Views on passwords are always changing and evolving. Requiring employees to change their passwords every 30, 60, or 90 days has been a business standard for years, but the National Counterintelligence and Security Center (NCSC) changed their stance and now <a href=\"https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/problems-forcing-regular-password-expiry\">advises against password rotation as a policy</a>.</p>\n<p>Your employees should create a strong and unique password for every account, and only change these passwords if they suspect an account has been compromised.</p>\n<h2 id=\"educate-your-team\">Educate your team</h2>\n<p>Your employees are only human, and humans will naturally try to find the shortest path to the end result. But if you help your employees create <a href=\"https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/top-10-security-awareness-training-topics-for-your-employees/#gref\">smart, easy-to-follow password and security habits</a> from day one, they&rsquo;re more likely to stick.</p>\n<p>You want to instill a questioning nature in your employees without going overboard. Your employees should be cautious of links or files from unknown senders, aware of how and where data is stored and protected, as well as what information they can publicly share.</p>\n<p>If your employees are empowered to make smart choices, your company&rsquo;s data is more likely to be safe.</p>\n<h2 id=\"put-the-right-tools-in-place\">Put the right tools in place</h2>\n<p>Having the <a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/306294\">right tools in place</a> from the beginning helps your employees create good security habits. It&rsquo;s easier to help your employees start off on the right foot than it is to try to make a company-wide change further down the road after your employees have had the chance to develop their own bad habits.</p>\n<p>At a minimum, your employees should be set up with a password manager and two-factor authentication on all accounts that offer it. A good password manager is designed to blend into your routine so seamlessly that it&rsquo;s actually harder for your employees not to use it.</p>\n<p>At 1Password, every business account comes with a <a href=\"https://1password.com/business/\">free family account</a> to help your team practice good security habits both at work and at home.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-handle-a-data-breach\">How to handle a data breach</h2>\n<p>The gold standard of breach response belongs to the <a href=\"https://www.troyhunt.com/the-red-cross-blood-service-australias-largest-ever-leak-of-personal-data/\">Australian Red Cross Blood Service</a>. In 2016 a text file containing sensitive donor information, including blood type and eligibility answers, was found on a public-facing site. This kind of breach could be devastating.</p>\n<p>Within 72 hours of being notified, the Red Cross determined what happened, had their CEO give a straightforward and thorough statement, and set up a call center for inquiries. All of this, even though they determined that only two people (one being Troy) had accessed the file.</p>\n<p>When a breach happens to your business, it&rsquo;s essential that you step up and take ownership. <a href=\"https://blog.1password.com/facebook-password-change/\">Downplaying or brushing</a> off the incident doesn&rsquo;t give your customers confidence in your ability to protect their data going forward.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whats-up-next\">What&rsquo;s up next</h2>\n<p>If you enjoyed this webinar, <a href=\"https://1password.com/webinars/\">sign up</a> to find out about our upcoming webinars.

After some great work by the team over the last few weeks, 1Password 7.3 for Windows is ready, and you can download it now. There&rsquo;s a lot to enjoy with this release, and we hope you love it as much as we do.</p>\n<p>With 1Password 7.3 for Windows, our teams have made some huge changes to the way the app looks and works. We&rsquo;ve taken the 1Password that you all know and love and then supercharged it. With this update installed, you&rsquo;re getting the best version of 1Password that Windows has ever seen.</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s so much to share that we&rsquo;re just going to jump right in, and as ever the full rundown of what has changed under the hood can be found in <a href=\"https://app-updates.agilebits.com/product_history/OPW6\">our release notes</a>.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/opw73/secure-desktop.gif' alt='Secure Desktop in 1Password 7.3 for Windows' title='Secure Desktop in 1Password 7.3 for Windows' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<h2 id=\"watchtower-and-security\">Watchtower and security</h2>\n<p>Security is always at the forefront of everything we do at 1Password, and we never miss an opportunity to make it easier for you to stay secure, too. To that end we&rsquo;ve added support for Secure Desktop, giving you the option of unlocking 1Password in an isolated desktop environment. That isolation ensures that no other apps can run alongside it, preventing key loggers from capturing anything you type.</p>\n<p>We&rsquo;ve made changes to how Watchtower banners keep you safe, too. 1Password now ranks Watchtower banners by their severity, helping those items at the greatest risk stand out from the crowd. Banners can now also be collapsed, making items easier to read and use.</p>\n<h2 id=\"security-never-looked-so-good\">Security never looked so good</h2>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/opw73/new-item-detail.gif' alt='UI Improvements for item details' title='UI Improvements for item details' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>We think that a great-looking app is one you&rsquo;ll keep coming back to, and 1Password is no different. We&rsquo;ve made changes throughout this release to make 1Password look better than ever. Everything is more colorful, more sleek, and more polished to help make passwords fun. You&rsquo;ll notice that passwords now have colorful characters to help differentiate them, and right beside your password is a new, more color-filled password strength indicator. Fantastic passwords are green, and poor passwords are red ��� who doesn&rsquo;t love a traffic light system?</p>\n<p>Continuing the polishing process, 1Password 7.3 will identify the type of credit card based on just the first few numbers you enter. That means not only can we format those numbers for easier reading, but the default card images used are now more representative of the real-world card, too. Amex cards now look like real Amex cards and Visa cards now look like Visa cards, making it easier than ever to identify a card at a glance.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/opw73/old-new.gif' alt='7.2 to 7.3 Improvements' title='7.2 to 7.3 Improvements' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>Rounding things out, 1Password templates now speak your language for all item types.

We wanted to make 1Password available when you need it without it getting in your way, so we&rsquo;ve revamped keyboard shortcuts with 1Password 7.3. Those who like to take full control can now customize their shortcuts, or even disable them.

Once open, the menu offers up options to copy an item&rsquo;s username, password, or even one-time password for those website that support them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"and-much-much-more\">And much, much more</h2>\n<p>There is of course much more to look forward to with 1Password 7.3, including a brand new installer. 1Password is now even more responsive when starting, which means using the app is now slicker than ever before.

Brendan previously co-founded Mozilla, where he helped launch Firefox, and is the creator of Javascript. Today, he works with Brave to help people protect their privacy online.</p>\n<p>If you want to know who can access your information while you surf the web, and how you can take back control, then read on.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-surveillance-capitalism\">What is surveillance capitalism?</h2>\n<p>Most websites you visit have ads or links with trackers that are designed to associate or identify you. These trackers then follow every move you make online, collecting more information as you browse. When you use Single-Sign-On (SSO) options like Google, Facebook, Apple, or Twitter, they even follow you across devices. That���s why ads for coats start appearing on your mobile after you���ve been shopping for one on your PC.</p>\n<p>That information is then shared with marketers, publishers, and companies, so they can target you with ads tailored to catch your attention. You and your data become the product, leaving you vulnerable to malware and ad fraud.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-can-you-protect-yourself\">How can you protect yourself?</h2>\n<p>Your data belongs to you, and you should control who can access it. Luckily, there are a few ways you can protect yourself.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Use an ad blocker extension.</strong> Ad blockers prevent advertisements from being displayed in your browser, which reduces the risk of tracking or clicking a malicious link.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Use a privacy-focused browser.</strong> Brave protects you by default, breaking almost all advertising, and blocking any tracking scripts.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Pay for premium service</strong>. Many websites or apps give you the option of paying for a premium, ad-free version of their software. As they���re funded by paying customers, they���re less dependent on ads to generate revenue, so have less need to track you.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"whats-the-impact\">What&rsquo;s the impact?</h2>\n<p>Though only a small percentage of people use their browser to block ads and trackers, the numbers are growing. And it has an impact. We���re seeing that impact in new privacy regulations designed to protect consumers, which are being rolled out all over the world.</p>\n<p>But protecting people from tracking and data collection has collateral damage for publishers. Publishers and marketers need something as simple for them to use as current ad tech is, but without the tracking.</p>\n<p>The ideal is to strike a balance that works for all invested parties: to give marketers a way to share ads at the opportune time, while providing you with a way to turn off ads if you want. Blocking ads by default in a browser like Brave gives you options for giving back, but the ultimate goal is to keep users safe.</p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 04 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":10468,"bgimg":"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2020/brave-survelliance-capitalism/header.png","linkMd5":"a5b1999574f4343603c22869a7c4a658","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn73@2020_2/2020/08/25/00-54-53-197_f2a29ddc47da27b9.webp","destWidth":2080,"destHeight":800,"sourceBytes":35749,"destBytes":57410,"author":"Sarah Brown","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2020/brave-survelliance-capitalism/header.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn73@2020_2/2020/08/25/00-54-53-197_f2a29ddc47da27b9.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598316891414},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:54:51","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:54:51","title":"The Climate Fixathon: using tech to fight climate change","link":"https://blog.1password.com/climate-fixathon/","description":"\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/climate-fixathon/header.png' class='webfeedsFeaturedVisual' alt='The Climate Fixathon: using tech to fight climate change' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p class=\"introduction\">At 1Password, we aim to make the online world a better, safer place. But climate change is the biggest threat to the future of our planet, and we want to make a difference there too. That���s why we chose to sponsor the Climate Fixathon.</p>\n<p>The Climate Fixathon is the world&rsquo;s first online hackathon for makers to help fix the climate. If you���re not familiar, a hackathon is a coding competition, usually held over a set period. People come together to test their skills to solve a particular problem or just create something great. The Climate Fixathon is a 4-week competition, held entirely online.</p>\n<p>As someone who cares deeply about our planet, (last year, I embarked on a 24-day expedition for marine conservation) I was thrilled to be one of the judges. Reviewing and testing the 43 projects from across the globe was eye-opening. It was exciting to see the tech community come together to create websites, apps, and services that aim to help restore a safe climate for our planet. Technology is a powerful force for doing good.</p>\n<p>There were three categories: Awareness, Action, and Facilitation. On offer was $1,500 for the winning team of each category. As you���d expect, the standard of entries was incredibly high across the board, but there were a few that impressed me in particular.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://hqco2.org/\">HQ���CO2</a> was chosen as the project that best raises awareness of climate breakdown. The website juxtaposes random pairs of images: the headquarters of high-emissions fossil fuel companies with places around the world affected by global warming. It was thought-provoking to see how the HQ pictures appear static and unchanging, while the picture alongside shows dynamic ecological breakdown.</p>\n<p>Also recognised by the judges was <a href=\"https://climate365.org/\">Climate 365</a>, an email service that repeatedly contacts those in power urging them to take action against climate change. Their tool for digital protest won the prize for Action. The prize for Facilitation was awarded to <a href=\"https://triptocarbon.xyz/#\">Trip to Carbon</a>, a carbon footprint calculator with simple API that can be integrated into new and existing websites and products to raise awareness of climate change.</p>\n<p>Another favourite of mine was the <a href=\"https://arctic-calculator.co.uk/\">Arctic Calculator</a>. You enter the distance travelled and it gives you the area of the Arctic circle you���re responsible for melting. Certainly difficult to ignore. <a href=\"https://shift.andrewpairman.com/\">Shift</a> was another great website that everyone can use to make a difference. It tells when grid production in your area is at its least carbon-intense, so that you can time your household electricity consumption, like putting the washing machine on.</p>\n<p>All exciting and impactful projects that are sure to inspire change. It���s certainly sparked some food for thought about how we do things at 1Password.</p>\n<p>To learn more about all of the entries, visit <a href=\"https://fixathon.io/\">the Climate Fixathon website</a>.

Protecting customers&rsquo; data has always been our highest priority, and this certification is one more way we can attest to that.</p>\n<p>SOC stands for Service and Organization Controls, a family of certifications related to others you might have heard of like ISO or FedRAMP. While there are SOC1, SOC2 and SOC3 the one relevant to 1Password is SOC2. Being <a href=\"https://1password.com/soc/\">SOC2 certified</a> means that we&rsquo;ve demonstrated that we follow best practices for Security and Availability.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/socannouncement/SOC-seal.png' alt='SOC Seal' title='SOC Seal' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>Security in this case is not about our encryption, which we all know is the best out there. ���� In the world of SOC2, Security ensures that we have���and follow���processes and policies that keep 1Password secure from all angles- everything from the way we train our employees to how the software is developed. Availability means -you guessed it- that 1Password will be working whenever you need it to.</p>\n<p>Demonstrating our commitment to security and availability sounded like an easy task but as we went throughout the process we discovered there was much more to it. We created a 1Password Team account to help with the process, using it to communicate securely with the auditors and store all our documentation. The whole process took about a year and a half, and we couldn&rsquo;t have done it without 1Password.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-we-used-1password-to-certify-1password\">How we used 1Password to certify 1Password</h2>\n<p>There are two types of SOC2: Type 1 certifies that you have policies in place, while Type 2 verifies that you follow them. And because we always aim high, we set out to do both.</p>\n<p>To start, we ensured that we had policies and procedures in place. For example, we&rsquo;ve always had security training for 1Password employees but now we have a new policy for annual training for everyone in the company. This stage took several months, but by the end, we had quite a few documents that needed to be shared among the SOC2 team. To do this easily and securely, we used the Shared vault in our Team account.</p>\n<p>To meet the requirements of Type 2 we had to demonstrate that we could enforce our policies during a period of six months. Thanks to our awesome employees that was never much of a challenge. Everyone received security training in January as promised. To demonstrate our compliance we produced dozens of documents- everything from spreadsheets, screenshots, PDFs, quick notes&hellip; We not only had to share these with auditors, we also had to track the changes that had been made since Type 1.</p>\n<p>Thankfully 1Password made it easy. With a few clicks, we created an additional vault for all the new documents and shared it. As the auditors provided feedback, we were able to update those documents and keep track of previous changes using item history. Each item keeps track of who did changes and when so there was a built in audit trail.</p>\n<p>To stay organized, we used tags that allowed us to categorize, then find, items of each kind. The tag &ldquo;Updated&rdquo; immediately showed us documents that had to be adjusted. With a click on the &ldquo;From Auditors&rdquo; tag, we could see all those items uploaded by the auditors, while &ldquo;From AgileBits&rdquo; gave us all those that we uploaded.</p>\n<p>Every item in 1Password has a field for notes. These notes helped us communicate details that didn&rsquo;t belong in the document or title.

I tried to make up for this by including some pretty pictures but most of them ended up being code snippets. ����</p>\n<h2 id=\"1password-and-aws\">1Password and AWS</h2>\n<p>1Password is hosted by Amazon Web Services (AWS). We���ve been using AWS for several years now, and it is incredible how easy it was to scale our service from zero users three years ago to several million happy customers today.</p>\n<p>AWS has many geographical regions. Each region consists of multiple independent data centres located closely together. We are currently using three regions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>N. Virginia, USA <code>us-east-1</code></li>\n<li>Montreal, Canada <code>ca-central-1</code></li>\n<li>Frankfurt, Germany <code>eu-central-1</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>In each region we have four environments running 1Password:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>production</li>\n<li>staging</li>\n<li>testing</li>\n<li>development</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you are counting, that���s 12 environments across three regions, including three production environments: <a href=\"https://start.1password.com/\">1password.com</a>, <a href=\"https://start.1password.ca/\">1password.ca</a>, and <a href=\"https://start.1password.eu/\">1password.eu</a>.</p>\n<p>Every 1Password environment is more or less identical and includes these components:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Virtual Private Cloud</li>\n<li>Amazon Aurora database cluster</li>\n<li>Caching (Redis) clusters</li>\n<li>Subnets</li>\n<li>Routing tables</li>\n<li>Security roles</li>\n<li>IAM permissions</li>\n<li>Auto-scaling groups</li>\n<li>Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances</li>\n<li>Elastic Load Balancers (ELB)</li>\n<li>Route53 DNS (both internal and external)</li>\n<li>Amazon S3 buckets</li>\n<li>CloudFront distributions</li>\n<li>Key Management System (KMS)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here is a simplified diagram:</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/terraforming-1password/simplified-1password-env.png' alt='1Password environment' title='1Password environment' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>As you can see, there are many components working together to provide 1Password service. One of the reasons it is so complex is the need for high availability. Most of the components are deployed as a cluster to make sure there are at least two of each: database, cache, server instance, and so on.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, every AWS region has at least two data centres that are also known as Availability Zones (AZs) ��� you can see them in blue in the diagram above. Every AZ has its own independent power and network connections. For example, Canadian region <code>ca-central-1</code> has two data centres: <code>ca-central-1a</code> and <code>ca-central-1b</code>.</p>\n<p>If we deployed all 1Password components into just a single Availability Zone, then we would not be able to achieve high availability because a single problem in the data centre would take 1Password offline. This is why when 1Password services are deployed in a region, we make sure that every component has at least one backup in the neighbouring data centre. This helps to keep 1Password running even when there���s a problem in one of the data centres.</p>\n<h2 id=\"infrastructure-as-code\">Infrastructure as Code</h2>\n<p>It would be very challenging and error-prone to manually deploy and maintain 12 environments, especially when you consider that each environment consists of at least 50 individual components.</p>\n<p>This is why so many companies today switched from updating their infrastructure manually and embraced Infrastructure as Code. With Infrastructure as Code, the hardware becomes software and can take advantage of all software development best practices. When we apply these practices to infrastructure, every server, every database, every open network port can be written in code, committed to GitHub, peer-reviewed, and then deployed and updated as many times as necessary.</p>\n<p>For AWS customers, two major languages could be used to describe and maintain the infrastructure:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/\">AWS CloudFormation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.terraform.io/\">HashiCorp Terraform</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>CloudFormation is an excellent option for many AWS customers, and we successfully used it to deploy 1Password environments for over two years. At the same time we wanted to move to Terraform as our main infrastructure tool for several reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Terraform has a more straightforward and powerful language (HCL) that makes it easier to write and review code.</li>\n<li>Terraform has the concept of <a href=\"https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/\">resource providers</a> that allows us to manage resources outside of Amazon Web Services, including services like <a href=\"https://www.datadoghq.com/\">DataDog</a> and <a href=\"https://www.pagerduty.com/\">PagerDuty</a>, which we rely on internally.</li>\n<li>Terraform is completely open source and that makes it easier to understand and troubleshoot.</li>\n<li>We are already using Terraform for smaller web apps at AgileBits, and it makes sense to standardize on a single tool.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Compared to the JSON or YAML files used by CloudFormation, Terraform HCL is both a more powerful and a more readable language. Here is a small example of a snippet that defines a subnet for the application servers. As you can see, the Terraform code is a quarter of the size, more readable, and easier to understand.</p>\n<h3 id=\"cloudformation\">CloudFormation</h3>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-html\" data-lang=\"html\">&#34;B5AppSubnet1&#34;: {\n&#34;Type&#34;: &#34;AWS::EC2::Subnet&#34;,\n&#34;Properties&#34;: {\n&#34;CidrBlock&#34;: { &#34;Fn::Select&#34; : [&#34;0&#34;, { &#34;Fn::FindInMap&#34; : [ &#34;SubnetCidr&#34;, { &#34;Ref&#34; : &#34;Env&#34; }, &#34;b5app&#34;] }] },\n&#34;AvailabilityZone&#34;: { &#34;Fn::Select&#34; : [ &#34;0&#34;, { &#34;Fn::GetAZs&#34; : &#34;&#34; } ]},\n&#34;VpcId&#34;: { &#34;Ref&#34;: &#34;Vpc&#34; },\n&#34;Tags&#34;: [\n{ &#34;Key&#34; : &#34;Application&#34;, &#34;Value&#34; : &#34;B5&#34; },\n{ &#34;Key&#34; : &#34;env&#34;, &#34;Value&#34;: { &#34;Ref&#34; : &#34;Env&#34; } },\n{ &#34;Key&#34; : &#34;Name&#34;, &#34;Value&#34;: { &#34;Fn::Join&#34; : [&#34;-&#34;, [ {&#34;Ref&#34; : &#34;Env&#34;}, &#34;b5&#34;, &#34;b5app-subnet1&#34;]] } }\n]\n}\n},\n&#34;B5AppSubnet2&#34;: {\n&#34;Type&#34;: &#34;AWS::EC2::Subnet&#34;,\n&#34;Properties&#34;: {\n&#34;CidrBlock&#34;: { &#34;Fn::Select&#34; : [&#34;1&#34;, { &#34;Fn::FindInMap&#34; : [ &#34;SubnetCidr&#34;, { &#34;Ref&#34; : &#34;Env&#34; }, &#34;b5app&#34;] }] },\n&#34;AvailabilityZone&#34;: { &#34;Fn::Select&#34; : [ &#34;1&#34;, { &#34;Fn::GetAZs&#34; : &#34;&#34; } ]},\n&#34;VpcId&#34;: { &#34;Ref&#34;: &#34;Vpc&#34; },\n&#34;Tags&#34;: [\n{ &#34;Key&#34; : &#34;Application&#34;, &#34;Value&#34; : &#34;B5&#34; },\n{ &#34;Key&#34; : &#34;env&#34;, &#34;Value&#34;: { &#34;Ref&#34; : &#34;Env&#34; } },\n{ &#34;Key&#34; : &#34;Name&#34;, &#34;Value&#34;: { &#34;Fn::Join&#34; : [&#34;-&#34;, [ {&#34;Ref&#34; : &#34;Env&#34;}, &#34;b5&#34;, &#34;b5app-subnet2&#34;]] } }\n]\n}\n},\n&#34;B5AppSubnet3&#34;: {\n&#34;Type&#34;: &#34;AWS::EC2::Subnet&#34;,\n&#34;Properties&#34;: {\n&#34;CidrBlock&#34;: { &#34;Fn::Select&#34; : [&#34;2&#34;, { &#34;Fn::FindInMap&#34; : [ &#34;SubnetCidr&#34;, { &#34;Ref&#34; : &#34;Env&#34; }, &#34;b5app&#34;] }] },\n&#34;AvailabilityZone&#34;: { &#34;Fn::Select&#34; : [ &#34;2&#34;, { &#34;Fn::GetAZs&#34; : &#34;&#34; } ]},\n&#34;VpcId&#34;: { &#34;Ref&#34;: &#34;Vpc&#34; },\n&#34;Tags&#34;: [\n{ &#34;Key&#34; : &#34;Application&#34;, &#34;Value&#34; : &#34;B5&#34; },\n{ &#34;Key&#34; : &#34;env&#34;, &#34;Value&#34;: { &#34;Ref&#34; : &#34;Env&#34; } },\n{ &#34;Key&#34; : &#34;Name&#34;, &#34;Value&#34;: { &#34;Fn::Join&#34; : [&#34;-&#34;, [ {&#34;Ref&#34; : &#34;Env&#34;}, &#34;b5&#34;, &#34;b5app-subnet3&#34;]] } }\n]\n}\n},\n</code></pre></div><h3 id=\"terraform\">Terraform</h3>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-html\" data-lang=\"html\">resource &#34;aws_subnet&#34; &#34;b5app&#34; {\ncount = &#34;${length(var.subnet_cidr[&#34;b5app&#34;])}&#34;\nvpc_id = &#34;${aws_vpc.b5.id}&#34;\ncidr_block = &#34;${element(var.subnet_cidr[&#34;b5app&#34;],count.index)}&#34;\navailability_zone = &#34;${var.az[count.index]}&#34;\ntags {\nApplication = &#34;B5&#34;\nenv = &#34;${var.env}&#34;\ntype = &#34;${var.type}&#34;\nName = &#34;${var.env}-b5-b5app-subnet-${count.index}&#34;\n}\n}\n</code></pre></div><p>Terraform has another gem of a feature that we rely on: <code>terraform plan</code>.

DevOps people like to enjoy their lives too. ����</p>\n<h2 id=\"migration-from-cloudformation-to-terraform\">Migration from CloudFormation to Terraform</h2>\n<p>It is possible to simply import the existing AWS infrastructure directly into Terraform, but there are certain downsides to it. We found that naming conventions are quite different and that would make it more challenging to maintain our environments in the future. Also, a simple import would not allow us to use the new Terraform features. For example, instead of hard-coding the identifiers of Amazon Machine Images used for deployment we started using <code>aws_ami</code> to find the most recent image dynamically:</p>\n<h3 id=\"aws_ami\">aws_ami</h3>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-html\" data-lang=\"html\">data &#34;aws_ami&#34; &#34;bastion_ami&#34; {\nmost_recent = true\nfilter {\nname = &#34;architecture&#34;\nvalues = [&#34;x86_64&#34;]\n}\nfilter {\nname = &#34;name&#34;\nvalues = [&#34;bastion-*&#34;]\n}\nfilter {\nname = &#34;virtualization-type&#34;\nvalues = [&#34;hvm&#34;]\n}\nname_regex = &#34;bastion-.*&#34;\nowners = [92135000000]\n}\n</code></pre></div><p>It took us a couple of weeks to write the code from scratch. After we had the same infrastructure described in Terraform, we recreated all non-production environments where downtime wasn���t an issue. This also allowed us to create a complete checklist of all the steps required to migrate the production environment.</p>\n<p>Finally, on January 21, 2018, we completely recreated 1Password.com. We had to bring the service offline during the migration. Most of our customers were not affected by the downtime because the 1Password apps are designed to function even when the servers are down or when an Internet connection is not available. Unfortunately, our customers who needed to access the web interface during that time were unable to do so, and we apologize for the interruption. Most of the 2 hours and 39 minutes of downtime were related to data migration. The 1Password.com database is just under 1TB in size (not including documents and attachments), and it took almost two hours to complete the snapshot and restore operations.</p>\n<p>We are excited to finally have all our development, test, staging, and production environments managed with Terraform. There are many new features and improvements we have planned for 1Password, and it will be fun to review new infrastructure pull requests on GitHub!</p>\n<p>I remember when we were starting out we hosted our very first server with 1&amp;1. It would have taken weeks to rebuild the very simple environment there. The world has come a long way since we first launched 1Passwd 13 years ago. I am looking forward to what the next 13 years will bring! ����</p>\n<h2 id=\"questions\">Questions</h2>\n<p>A few questions and suggestions about the migration came up on Twitter:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>By ���recreating��� you mean building out a whole new VPC with Terraform? Couldn���t you build it then switch existing DNS over for much less down time?1</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is pretty much what we ended up doing. Most of the work was performed before the downtime. Then we updated the DNS records to point to the new VPC.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Couldn���t you���ve imported all online resources?

We���ve known for a while now that <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/pixel/new-features-pixel4/\">face unlock was arriving with the Pixel 4</a>, and this update prepared 1Password for that eventuality. The only thing I was missing was the actual device so I could write about the experience firsthand.</p>\n<p>Each year, I eagerly await the Made by Google event in October when <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/pixel-4-every-made-by-google-2019-announcement-pixel-buds-pixelbook-go-google-stadia/\">Google shows off their latest and greatest hardware</a>. It���s like Christmas come early for me, and this year was no exception. As soon as I was able to, I pre-ordered a <a href=\"https://store.google.com/product/pixel_4\">Pixel 4 XL</a> from my carrier and waited impatiently for it to arrive.</p>\n<p>I���m happy to say that it arrived last week, and it was well worth the wait. I���ve since put 1Password through its paces on my new device, and here���s where we truly shine.</p>\n<h2 id=\"pixel-4-xl-meet-1password\">Pixel 4 XL, meet 1Password</h2>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/pixel4-1password/lightmodeunlock.gif' alt='Pixel 4 Face Unlock' title='Pixel 4 Face Unlock' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>Of course, the first thing I do whenever I get a new device is set up 1Password. As you might imagine, I use a long Master Password to secure my 1Password accounts, and this can be a bit of a pain to type on mobile. Fingerprint unlock has made it so much quicker for me to unlock 1Password and I&rsquo;ve made heavy use of it over the past few years.</p>\n<p>Face unlock takes it to the next level. It took only a moment to set up and now when I launch 1Password, the sequence of verifying my face and unlocking happens faster than me even thinking about moving my finger to that non-existent fingerprint sensor. In fact, after a week of using face unlock, the muscle memory is all but gone.</p>\n<h2 id=\"face-unlock-everywhere\">Face unlock everywhere</h2>\n<p>After setting up 1Password on my new Pixel 4 XL, the next order of business was to sign back in to all of my apps. Autofill with 1Password made this a breeze. And even though some of my favourite apps don���t yet support face authentication, 1Password covered for them quite nicely. I simply tapped on the Autofill with 1Password prompt to unlock with my face and sign in to the app.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/pixel4-1password/Quick_unlock.png' alt='Open your Pixel with Face Unlock' title='Open your Pixel with Face Unlock' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<h2 id=\"easy-sign-in-and-sign-up\">Easy sign-in and sign-up</h2>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/pixel4-1password/darkmodeautofill.gif' alt='Autofill with Face Unlock' title='Autofill with Face Unlock' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>Speaking of Autofill, the improvements that we���ve been making over the last couple of releases go well beyond the Pixel 4. Depending on which version of Android you���re running and which browser you prefer, you may be using our Autofill service, our Accessibility service, or a combination of the two. We���ve synced them up so that you get the same experience, no matter which one you happen to be using.</p>\n<p>We���ve enhanced both services to support filling in Login details, even when those details are split across multiple screens. This includes filling in your TOTP codes for you, so you no longer have to bother with copying them to the clipboard. Our Autofill and Accessibility services also let you create new Login items when signing up for a new account.</p>\n<p>Taken together, these changes make it so much easier to sign up for and sign in to apps and websites. No more flipping between apps.</p>\n<h2 id=\"looks-arent-everything-but-they-certainly-help\">Looks aren���t everything, but they certainly help</h2>\n<p>Not only does 1Password work great on the Pixel 4, but it looks great too! When Android 10 launched earlier this year, we <a href=\"https://blog.1password.com/1password-7-2-for-android-dark-theme-rises/\">dressed 1Password up for the occasion in new dark attire</a>. I thought it looked good then, but I have to say that the 90Hz screen of my new Pixel makes Dark Theme truly shine. And Ambient EQ ensures that the colour and brightness are right for any environment. Now I just need to decide whether to commit to one theme or to continue switching between the two.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/pixel4-1password/Keeping_things_accessible.png' alt='Accessibility in Dark Theme' title='Accessibility in Dark Theme' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>Did you recently snag your own Pixel 4?

An important part of this partnership is growth. As we said at the time, ���we���ve reached a point where we need expertise and guidance from those who���ve made this journey before.���</p>\n<p>Jackie brings invaluable experience to our team from her time at Atlassian, New Relic, and HelloSign (now a Dropbox company) ��� a huge step on that journey. She joins other strategic, senior hires on the product and development sides who, together with the rest of the 1Password team, will shape an exciting future built on 1Password values.</p>\n<p>Until now, we���ve mostly grown organically. Dave and Roustem launched 1Password fifteen years ago to make it easier for people to use passwords online. People used it, talked about it, and gave us invaluable feedback, and we kept working to make it better. It���s that cycle that���s brought 1Password to 60,000 businesses like Basecamp, Slack, and IBM ��� and millions of people all over the world.</p>\n<p>I���m incredibly proud of everyone who has helped us achieve what we have so far, and excited to see how the 1Password team old and new will work together to make 1Password better for everyone.</p>\n<p>Jackie joins us at what we know is a challenging time for businesses, many of which have been forced to pivot rapidly to remote working, with all the challenges that poses to working safely online. To that end, Jackie will also help us raise awareness of our <a href=\"https://blog.1password.com/covid-19-response/\">COVID-19 response</a>, making 1Password Business free for businesses to try for 6 months.</p>\n<p>Here���s Jackie to wrap up with a few words:</p>\n<p>���I���m pleased to join 1Password on its mission to secure passwords and information for businesses, enterprises, and all 1Password users while maintaining the customer- and privacy-oriented values that the company is built on.</p>\n<p>���I joined 1Password for three reasons: the incredible market opportunity, the wonderful team and culture, and most importantly the obsession with customers. The unwavering commitment to customers and their privacy is what sets us apart and why I couldn���t be more excited to accelerate adoption of 1Password.���</p>\n<p>Thank you, Jackie.

It allows you to navigate between your categories and tags just like you always could, but now your vaults live there as well.</p>\n<h2 id=\"all-your-vaults-all-in-one-place\">All your vaults, all in one place</h2>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/opw7.0-beta/vault-sidebar.jpeg' alt='Easily browse account vaults and standalone vaults with 1Password 7 Beta for Windows' title='Easily browse account vaults and standalone vaults with 1Password 7 Beta for Windows' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>Organizing your items into vaults is a great way to keep your items tidy and share them with those who need them.</p>\n<p>Vaults are so nice that you���ll find yourself adding lots of them. Thankfully the sidebar makes it easy to see every vault you have at a glance. If you want to zoom in and see all the items in a vault or an account, just click on it. When you���re ready to zoom out again, click All Vaults to see all your items.</p>\n<p>Between my AgileBits business and Teare family accounts, I now have over 50 vaults. Being able to switch between vaults and accounts makes it super simple to stay focused on the task at hand. Which is perfect for those days when I need to find my mom���s Pok��mon password. ����</p>\n<h2 id=\"hahahugoshortcode-s3-hbhb-large-passwords\"><small>Small passwords.</small>\nLarge passwords!</h2>\n<p>If you spend as much time looking at computer screens as I do, your eyes will love our new Large Type.

That&rsquo;s why, if your company uses 1Password Business, you get a free <a href=\"https://1password.com/families/\">1Password Families membership</a>. Your family account can be shared with up to five family members to help keep everyone more secure ��� no matter where they are.</p>\n<p>Your family account belongs to you, not your company. Your family and business accounts work independently from each other, meaning your information is never shared between them. Here&rsquo;s what you need to know about how your business and family accounts work to keep your personal information private, and make sure all your data is safe.</p>\n<h2 id=\"no-details-shared\">No details shared</h2>\n<p>With multiple accounts, it&rsquo;s easy to keep your personal and business data completely separate, and see all your information together in the 1Password apps.</p>\n<p>Linked family accounts only share their subscription status with the business account, so business administrators can&rsquo;t see what&rsquo;s stored in your family account, how many items or vaults you have, or who you share your family account with. Your private data remains private.</p>\n<h2 id=\"private-even-from-us\">Private, even from us</h2>\n<p>Your linked family account belongs solely to you, not your company, and your information is even kept <a href=\"https://1password.com/security/#privacy\">private from the team at 1Password</a>. Everything you store in 1Password is encrypted and inaccessible to us. Personally identifiable information is never shared with third parties, and is only used by us to provide you with service and support.</p>\n<p>We firmly believe that your data is yours, and we don&rsquo;t want to know anything about it. We don&rsquo;t use it, we don&rsquo;t share it, and we don&rsquo;t sell it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-happens-when-you-leave\">What happens when you leave?</h2>\n<p>Your 1Password Families membership is free to use as long as it&rsquo;s linked to a business account. But don&rsquo;t worry, you won&rsquo;t lose access to any of the information stored in your family account if you leave your job.</p>\n<p>When you leave the company, your family account is automatically unlinked from the business account and becomes frozen. Your data is kept safe and sound in a read-only state until you take further action. You can set up your own payment method to continue using your family account without interruption ��� until you convince your next company to sign up for 1Password Business.</p>\n<p>Are you ready to take advantage of your free 1Password Families membership? To get started, sign in to your business account and <a href=\"https://support.1password.com/link-family/\">redeem your family account</a> from your profile page.</p>\n<section class=\"c-call-to-action-box c-call-to-action-box--background-author\">\n<div class=\"c-call-to-action-box__author\">\n<img src=\"https://blog.1password.com/img/authors/sarahbrown.jpg\" class=\"c-call-to-action-box__author-image\" alt=\"Sarah Brown\"/>\n</div>\n<div class=\"c-call-to-action-box__content\">\n<h3 class=\"c-call-to-action-box__title\">Get more security tips</h3>\n<div class=\"c-call-to-action-box__text\">\nSign up to our business security mailing list and get advice on running a secure, productive workplace delivered directly to your inbox.\n</div>\n<form accept-charset=\"UTF-8\" action=\"https://agilemail.createsend.com/t/r/s/ohlyduj/\" class=\"oneline\" data-event-category=\"Newsletter\" data-event-action=\"form-newsletter\" id=\"newsletterForm\" method=\"post\">\n<div id=\"hidden-fields\"><input name=\"utf8\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"���\"><input name=\"authenticity_token\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"B2cHFMPBG0KjOnROQ884zCYcI0afwrAx897/qCCfum0=\"></div>\n<input class=\"c-call-to-action-box__newsletter-email\" id=\"cm-ohlyduj-ohlyduj\" name=\"cm-ohlyduj-ohlyduj\" type=\"email\" placeholder=\"wendy@appleseed.com\">\n<input class=\"c-call-to-action-box__newsletter-button\" type=\"submit\" value=\"Sign up\">\n</form>\n</div>\n</section>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 19 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":10468,"bgimg":"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2020/family-vs-business/header.png","linkMd5":"b95e0bacfc2431f92cacfc566cb1ee32","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn10@2020_5/2020/08/25/00-54-52-917_a9b5cd9ae31708d3.webp","destWidth":2080,"destHeight":800,"sourceBytes":37153,"destBytes":48682,"author":"Sarah Brown","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2020/family-vs-business/header.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn10@2020_5/2020/08/25/00-54-52-917_a9b5cd9ae31708d3.webp","https://blog.1password.com/img/authors/sarahbrown.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn63@2020_5/2020/08/25/00-55-08-297_4fbf004afcdefa0c.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598316891414},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:54:51","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:54:51","title":"Guard against external data breaches with domain breach reports","link":"https://blog.1password.com/domain-breach-report/","description":"\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2020/dbr-announcement/header.png' class='webfeedsFeaturedVisual' alt='Guard against external data breaches with domain breach reports' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p class=\"introduction\">I���m excited to announce the release of a new 1Password feature designed to help businesses keep their data safe: domain breach report. Create a report to get a list of all company email addresses that have been caught in known data breaches, so you can find and close doors to your data that have been unwittingly left open.</p>\n<h2 id=\"identify-risks-secure-your-company\">Identify risks, secure your company</h2>\n<p>Once you have the list of exposed email addresses, you can see the kinds of data exposed in each case. This helps you prioritize next actions.</p>\n<p>Crucially, the domain breach report flags exposed passwords, so you can let affected team members know they need to change those passwords immediately. You can also invite affected users to 1Password directly from the report so they can generate strong, unique passwords to use instead.</p>\n<p>Once set up with 1Password, they can also use <a href=\"https://support.1password.com/watchtower-privacy/\">1Password Watchtower</a> to see where breached passwords have been reused, and change them to make sure those exposed passwords don���t lead to more important accounts being compromised.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-businesses-need-to-care-about-data-breaches\">Why businesses need to care about data breaches</h2>\n<p>One breach can open many doors. Because of the widespread problem of password reuse, a data breach on one website can mean many other sites are affected. This is a huge blindspot for many organizations. <a href=\"https://services.google.com/fh/files/blogs/google_security_infographic.pdf\">Research by Google and Harris Poll</a> in February 2019 suggests that 65% of people reuse passwords on some or all of their accounts.</p>\n<p>Hackers use a relatively simple technique known as credential stuffing, where many stolen passwords (and similar computer-generated derivations) are ���stuffed��� into sites across the internet until the hacker is able to log in. According to the <a href=\"https://enterprise.verizon.com/resources/infographics/dbir-statistics.pdf\">Verizon 2020 Data Breach Investigations Report</a>, 67% of all breaches come from credential theft, errors, or social attacks.</p>\n<p>If hackers gain access to the applications you use for work, they may have access to sensitive information about your company, employees or customers. This could leave the company facing costly fines for violating regulations, and a loss of trust in its operations and brand.</p>\n<h2 id=\"respect-for-privacy\">Respect for privacy</h2>\n<p>If you know 1Password, you know we take security and privacy very seriously. For the domain breach report, we���ve taken a number of steps to make sure that, in highlighting risks posed by breaches, the privacy of your team is maintained:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Confirm your domains:</strong> we send a confirmation email, so only you can generate a report for your domains</li>\n<li><strong>Owners control access:</strong> only a 1Password owner in your business can create a domain breach ��� though they can choose to share it with administrators and a Security group they can create</li>\n<li><strong>Passwords and other data aren���t shown:</strong> you can see if a password has been exposed, not what it was ��� the same goes for other information exposed</li>\n<li><strong>Personally-sensitive breaches:</strong> breaches that are known to be personally sensitive, such as breaches of adult dating sites, do not appear in the report</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-get-started\">How to get started</h2>\n<p>Domain breach report is available today with 1Password Business and 1Password Teams. Visit 1Password Support to see how to <a href=\"https://support.1password.com/breach-report/\">create a domain breach report</a>, or if you don���t use 1Password you can <a href=\"https://1password.com/business/\">start a free trial</a> to create a report.</p>\n<p>We���re so excited to get this feature out into the world, as we think it can help businesses improve their security right away.

When Apple announced macOS Mojave with Dark Mode back in June, we knew we wanted to be there on day one with an update to 1Password that looked great in the dark. So we hiked up our programmer pants and got to work.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1password-has-a-dark-side\">1Password has a dark side</h2>\n<p>As soon as Tim Cook left the stage at the Worldwide Developers Conference keynote we hustled back to our hotel and got to work on some mockups for what a Dark Mode version of 1Password might look like. We started, naturally, with the lock screen:</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/opm7.2/image_0.png' alt='lock screen in dark mode' title='lock screen in dark mode' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>Of course we didn���t stop there. Once you unlock 1Password, you���ll be greeted with a user interface that is right at home in Dark Mode. I love how website icons pop against the dark background, making it easier than ever to spot the login you���re looking for.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/opm7.2/image_1.png' alt='item view in dark mode' title='item view in dark mode' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<h2 id=\"safari-support-baked-right-in\">Safari support, baked right in</h2>\n<p>1Password has had the ability to work within Safari for years, making it super easy to fill your usernames and passwords directly into websites. With 1Password 7.2 we���ve built the Safari extension right into the app, meaning you���ll never have to install a separate browser extension again!</p>\n<p>The new Safari 1Password extension also brings with it loads of security improvements. By using the new Safari App Extension feature provided by Apple, 1Password has even more protections against man-in-the-middle attacks and other exploits of that nature.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mojave-mo-secure\">Mojave, mo��� secure</h2>\n<p>The latest incarnation of macOS didn���t just come with a new pretty face; Apple also added some incredibly powerful security improvements for third party developers to take advantage of. We���re always keen to jump on anything that helps improve the security of our customers, so 1Password now runs within a hardened runtime. This &ldquo;hardened runtime&rdquo; ensures that 1Password cannot be manipulated or modified by other apps or processes running on your computer.</p>\n<p>1Password 7.2 also makes use of Apple���s new notary service: 1Password is now fully notarized, which means Apple has verified it as being free of malware. ����</p>\n<p>You���ll also notice that 1Password 7.2 no longer automatically submits passwords once they have been filled. This was a difficult decision to make, but we made it for a few reasons that we wanted to share:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sometimes a website doesn���t behave as 1Password might expect, resulting in passwords being filled sub-optimally, or fields being left blank. If 1Password were to automatically submit forms in these cases, users are left with an experience that we don���t feel reflects how we want 1Password to work and can lead to confusion.</li>\n<li>The mechanism by which 1Password was performing autosubmit is no longer supported in macOS Mojave. As yet another step towards a more secure environment, apps that can virtually type the ���Return��� key on the keyboard have been significantly restricted.</li>\n<li>1Password automatically leaves focus on the password field so there&rsquo;s no need to click the submit button. Just press the Enter key and you&rsquo;re all set. Alongside the Command-\\ fill keyboard shortcut, it works quite well.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We feel strongly that removing the ability to automatically submit passwords is the right call. I���ll be fully transparent, it���s taken some getting used to, but now that it���s part of my workflow&hellip; autosubmit? I don���t miss it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-do-i-get-it\">How do I get it?</h2>\n<p>We���re glad you asked!

It���s the digital gold rush, and everyone wants their share. The lure of riches is too much to ignore, but there are also enormous risks. We can���t teach you how to make the best investments, but we can help you manage your cryptocurrencies securely.</p>\n<p>I���ve been trading crypto for a while now, and to be perfectly honest, none of it would be possible without 1Password. It helps me stay secure, and creating and managing all of my credentials ��� 46 and counting ��� is an absolute breeze.</p>\n<h2 id=\"my-1-rule-set-up-1password-before-investing-in-crypto\">My #1 rule: Set up 1Password <em>before</em> investing in crypto</h2>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/cryptocurrency/secure-piggy.png' alt='Set up 1Password before investing in crypto' title='Set up 1Password before investing in crypto' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>Before you invest in crypto, you need to take your security seriously. The best way to do that is with 1Password. I���ve seen people invest without using a password manager at all, and I���m seriously terrified for them. They create weak passwords, which they store on a piece of paper or unencrypted on their device. Or, <a href=\"https://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2017/12/08/people_who_can_t_remember_their_bitcoin_passwords_are_really_freaking_out.html\">like a number of early bitcoin investors discovered</a>, they no longer remember their credentials. So while they may have thousands of dollars stored in a digital wallet somewhere, it���s lost forever.</p>\n<p>There have already been reports of people losing over $100,000 by <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bitcoins-worth-100k-stolen-over-public-wireless-network/\">accessing their accounts on public Wi-Fi</a>, or signing in to a fake website. While 1Password can���t protect you from insecure networks (if it���s unavoidable, always use a VPN like <a href=\"https://encrypt.me/\">Encrypt.me</a>), we can protect you from phishing sites, weak and duplicate passwords, and a foggy memory.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/cryptocurrency/swirl-of-coins.png' alt='How to use 1Password to store your crypto' title='How to use 1Password to store your crypto' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<h2 id=\"how-to-use-1password-to-store-your-crypto\">How to use 1Password to store your crypto</h2>\n<p>So just how can you use 1Password to manage your crypto? It depends what you���re storing: account credentials, private keys, wallet seeds and backups, or crypto addresses. I���ll shed some light on how I use 1Password to manage them all.</p>\n<h3 id=\"exchange-accounts\">Exchange accounts</h3>\n<p>Exchanges are where all the action takes place. After you���ve purchased some crypto, you can send it to an exchange and trade it for any other coin on offer. Unless you only trade the top 20, you���ll need to sign up for a few exchanges to buy the coins you want.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/cryptocurrency/exchange.png' alt='Exchange accounts' title='Exchange accounts' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>When I sign up for an exchange like Bittrex, Binance, or Kucoin, I save it as a Login item, just as I would for a regular account. I enable 2-factor authentication using <a href=\"https://support.1password.com/one-time-passwords\">one-time passwords</a>, and I strongly recommend you do the same before depositing money there.</p>\n<p>When I want to sign in, 1Password fills my username and password, and copies my one-time password to the clipboard for easy retrieval. Plus, it won���t fill my details anywhere except the specified URL, keeping me well protected from both man-in-the-middle and phishing attacks.</p>\n<h3 id=\"wallets\">Wallets</h3>\n<p>If the <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/non-experts-guide-mt-gox-fiasco/\">collapse of Mt Gox</a> taught us anything, it���s that you should always take your coins off an exchange. To keep them safe, you���ll need to set up some wallets. Cryptocurrency wallets allow you to interact with the blockchain to store, send, and receive crypto. Because most coins have their own blockchain, you���ll likely need more than one.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/cryptocurrency/software-wallet.png' alt='DeepOnion Wallet' title='DeepOnion Wallet' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>There are 3 main wallet types: <a href=\"https://blockgeeks.com/guides/cryptocurrency-wallet-guide/\">software, hardware, and paper</a>. Many people prefer hardware wallets like the <a href=\"https://www.ledgerwallet.com/products/ledger-nano\">Ledger Nano</a> because they���re not connected to the internet. My only advice here? <a href=\"https://news.bitcoin.com/mans-life-savings-stolen-from-hardware-wallet-supplied-by-a-reseller/\">Don���t buy one second hand</a>.</p>\n<p>I���m worried I���d lose a hardware wallet, so I use a mix of paper and software wallets and store the details in 1Password. I set up my software wallets on an encrypted Virtual Machine with the password saved as a Login item. I create a Login item for each wallet (software and paper), and use the password generator to create a wallet seed or passphrase.</p>\n<p>If my wallet address won���t change, I set it as the username. If I create multiple addresses, I add them to a new section called <code>Addresses</code> for easy retrieval. And if I need to save private keys, I add a new field to the Login item, label it <code>Private Key</code> and set it as a password so it���s always concealed.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/cryptocurrency/paper-wallet.png' alt='MyEtherWallet' title='MyEtherWallet' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>Once my wallet is encrypted, I save a backup and attach it to the Login item in 1Password. This way, if I ever lose my MacBook Pro, I can restore the wallets on another computer using my wallet backups and credentials.</p>\n<p>To help me see how my coins are spread, I can use the notes section to keep a tally. I find this especially helpful for keeping track of coins in MyEtherWallet, a paper wallet that stores both Ethereum and ERC20 tokens.</p>\n<h3 id=\"cryptocurrency-addresses\">Cryptocurrency addresses</h3>\n<p>Much like a bank account, if someone in my family wants to send me crypto, they���ll need to know my wallet address and the currency tied to it. 1Password covers that, too. I simply create a Bank Account item and name it after the currency. I use the name of the wallet for the bank, and insert my wallet address into the account number field. Then I just add it to our Shared vault so it���s there whenever they need it.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/cryptocurrency/coin-address.png' alt='Cryptocurrency addresses' title='Cryptocurrency addresses' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<h3 id=\"organise-your-crypto-with-tags\">Organise your crypto with tags</h3>\n<p>I have a lot of data in my vaults, and with my crypto items growing rapidly, I need a good way to organise them. Luckily, that���s a simple fix. All I need to do is tag them crypto and I can see everything at a glance.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/cryptocurrency/full-screenshot.png' alt='Organise your crypto with tags' title='Organise your crypto with tags' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<h2 id=\"pay-for-your-1password-account-with-crypto\">Pay for your 1Password account with crypto</h2>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/cryptocurrency/gift-card-eth-payment.png' alt='1Password gift cards - Eth payment' title='1Password gift cards - Eth payment' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>If you ever wanted to pay for your 1Password account with crypto, now you can.

There&rsquo;s even the Data Detox Bar, where you can find advice on how to take action to create a healthier digital life.</p>\n<p>One of my favorite pieces allowed me to explore infographics that looked into the political spending on Facebook. Clearly a contentious subject, it tells a story of who may be targeting you, what messages they are using, and the scale they are doing it on. Seeing targeting this personalized makes you question quite a bit of the content you see on social media, and how it may be manipulating you.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/glass-room-blog/catglassroom.png' alt='Cat Friend at the opening of The Glass Room' title='Cat Friend at the opening of The Glass Room' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>Another exhibit I found interesting was what seemed from a distance to be an innocuous map.

Here&rsquo;s how to set it up so you can take it for a spin.</p>\n<p>I recently <a href=\"https://blog.1password.com/1password-on-pixel4/\">upgraded to a Pixel 4 XL</a>, and I have a few tips and tricks to share for getting your shiny new phone up and running with 1Password.</p>\n<h2 id=\"lets-get-started\">Let&rsquo;s get started</h2>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/december-android-post/ChoosePlan.png' alt='Choose a plan' title='Choose a plan' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>First things first: if you don&rsquo;t already have one, <a href=\"https://1password.com/sign-up/\">sign up for a 1Password account</a>. 1Password for Android makes it quick and easy to sign up and set up your subscription through Google Play billing.</p>\n<p>Take your time creating your <a href=\"https://blog.1password.com/toward-better-master-passwords/\">Master Password</a>. Your Master Password plays an important role in protecting your data, so you want to go with something that&rsquo;s memorable to you, but unguessable to anyone else.</p>\n<p>If you already have a 1Password account, <a href=\"https://support.1password.com/add-account/\">scan your setup code</a> to add your 1Password account to your new device.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-perfect-setup\">The perfect setup</h2>\n<p>There are a few 1Password features I&rsquo;d recommend enabling or tweaking as soon as you set up.</p>\n<p>The first thing I&rsquo;d suggest is getting 1Password to automatically check for any vulnerable passwords you have. This will help you identify any passwords that have been reused or included in a data breach, so you can replace them with something stronger.</p>\n<p>Then, turn on both Autofill and Accessibility. These features allow you to get the most out of 1Password by detecting the appropriate Login item to auto-fill into apps and websites for you. No more tapping out long passwords. Just open and click!</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/december-android-post/pixel4-enable-face-unlock.gif' alt='Enable Face Unlock' title='Enable Face Unlock' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>Enable Biometric Unlock on your phone right away so you can unlock 1Password without typing in your Master Password. Just glance at your phone or tap your fingerprint to log in, and you&rsquo;re ready to go.</p>\n<p>Speaking of locking, you have the option to tweak those lock settings to your liking. Personally, I like to turn off &ldquo;lock on exit&rdquo; and instead choose to have 1Password lock automatically after two minutes of being idle. This allows me to open and flip between apps for short periods without having to repeatedly unlock 1Password.</p>\n<p>With 1Password for Android 7.2 we added support for a <a href=\"https://blog.1password.com/1password-7-2-for-android-dark-theme-rises/\">system-wide Dark Theme</a>. You can tell 1Password to use the Light Theme or Dark Theme exclusively, or you can do what I do and let 1Password follow the system default.</p>\n<h2 id=\"download-your-other-apps\">Download your other apps</h2>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/december-android-post/Autofill-03.png' alt='Autofill username and passwords' title='Autofill username and passwords' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>Once 1Password is set up, you&rsquo;re ready to start downloading and signing in to all of your other apps. If you&rsquo;ve already had your Login items for your apps stored and saved in 1Password, Autofill takes care of filling those in for you. Just a click and you&rsquo;re signed in!</p>\n<p>And if you don&rsquo;t have your credentials for an app already saved in 1Password? You can easily <a href=\"https://support.1password.com/android-filling/\">create a new Login item</a> without ever having to leave the app. I love how much this speeds up the setup process, getting me to the fun parts much more quickly.</p>\n<p>Did you get a brand new Android from Santa this year?

Automating things gives me more time to focus on what matters and I want you to have that power, too. So, I���m going to show you how your business can use the <a href=\"https://support.1password.com/command-line-getting-started/\">1Password command-line tool</a> and <a href=\"https://support.1password.com/scim/\">1Password SCIM bridge</a> in perfect harmony to automate all sorts of administrative tasks. Let���s get to it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"speed-up-specific-tasks-using-the-command-line-tool\">Speed up specific tasks using the command-line tool</h2>\n<p>With <a href=\"https://1password.com/business/\">1Password Business</a>, it���s simple for even the biggest, most complex enterprise to manage their account using the command-line tool. Just type a command to perform common administrative tasks like adding items, granting access to vaults, managing groups, <a href=\"https://support.1password.com/command-line/\">and more</a> ��� all in Terminal.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/automating-1password/find_out_who_has_access_inline.png' alt='illustration of terminal and iMac' title='illustration of terminal and iMac' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>But what should you try first? Something we hear from a lot of large businesses is that it���s difficult to see and manage exactly who has access to what. The 1Password command-line makes it easy. I���ll show you.</p>\n<p>To find out who has access to our Directors vault, I just type:</p>\n<p><code>op list users --vault=Directors</code></p>\n<p>Great! Now we have a list of people with direct access to the Directors vault. But while we&rsquo;re here, we should check which groups have access, too. Use:</p>\n<p><code>op list groups --vault=Directors</code></p>\n<p>That gives us a list of groups with access to that vault. Now, we need to check who belongs to those groups. So, for each of the groups we got from the last command, we can do:</p>\n<p><code>op list users --group=&lt;group uuid&gt;</code></p>\n<p>And with just a bit of deduplication, we can see exactly who can use items from the Directors vault. It&rsquo;s easy to script with the command-line tool, because the output is all JSON.</p>\n<p>There���s so much you can do with the command-line tool, and we have lots of new features coming soon. Keep an eye on the blog for some exciting announcements.</p>\n<h2 id=\"manage-your-whole-team-with-the-scim-bridge\">Manage your whole team with the SCIM bridge</h2>\n<p>Automating specific tasks is great, but we know that managing multiple services and online accounts can be a headache for your business. Luckily, enterprise identity providers make it easier. They make sure that everyone in your company gets access to all the tools they need, without forcing you to manage each service individually.</p>\n<p>If your business is using Okta or Azure Active Directory, <a href=\"https://blog.1password.com/scim-bridge-release\">SCIM integration</a> makes provisioning employees in 1Password a breeze. Onboarding is seamless: 1Password automatically syncs your identity provider���s groups with the groups in your 1Password account, so everyone in the company has access to the credentials they need from the get-go. Revoking access is just as quick.</p>\n<p>There are no complicated new systems for administrators to learn or time-consuming processes to implement ��� everything is managed from a single, central location. Oh, and the best part? It���s incredibly secure. All of this happens without ever sharing your account���s encryption keys, so you&rsquo;re always in control of your data..</p>\n<p>We&rsquo;ve been working hard to make it simple to automate your 1Password account and we���ll continue to make more automations possible over the coming months.

Other developers have integrated 1Password into their own apps because they were eager to offer their customers the very best experience. As developers ourselves, and people who use those apps, we can���t thank them enough for their work.</p> \n<p>Changes to the way iOS and Android handle password management and filling have given 1Password an opportunity to make password filling better than ever. It’s never been easier to use strong, secure passwords for every website and app you use. With support for Authentication Services and Password AutoFill in iOS 12 and the Autofill API in Android 8 (Oreo), 1Password is ready for the next step in our journey. And things will get even better as developers fully support all the new tools on offer.</p> \n<p>I’ve been using the latest autofill features on iOS and Android, and they’re brilliant. Entering passwords on a phone has never been easier. In fact, it’s downright fun. I’m a little bit in love with the work developers have already done to make our lives easier, and I’m so happy that everyone can now enjoy these features, too.</p> \n<img src=\"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/apps-love-1password/platforms.png\" alt=\"Icons for the Google Play Store and App Store\" title=\"Icons for the Google Play Store and App Store\" style=\"max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;\" /> \n<h2 id=\"developers-developers-developers\">Developers, developers, developers!</h2> \n<p>Even though Apple and Google have improved things with recent software updates to iOS and Android, there’s still work to be done by developers to make sure the experience is as great as possible. Adding support for the latest frameworks to your app means it will work great with 1Password, delighting your customers along the way.</p> \n<img src=\"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/apps-love-1password/we-love-apps.png\" alt=\"1Password icon holding a sign reading 'We Love Apps'\" title=\"1Password icon holding a sign reading 'We Love Apps'\" style=\"max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;\" /> \n<p>If you’re a developer, it’s trivial to add support to your app:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/password_autofill/setting_up_an_app_s_associated_domains?language=objc\">Optimize your iOS app for autofill</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/text/autofill-optimize\">Optimize your Android app for autofill</a></li> \n</ul> \n<p>Your customers will thank you, and so will we.

I have to admit it was tempting, but villains monopolize the dark side in that universe. Heroes can have a dark side too, as evidenced by our friend the Dark Knight, and Dark Theme is definitely the hero feature of this release!</p>\n<p>Without further ado, and only a few more pop-culture references, let&rsquo;s get into what&rsquo;s new in 1Password for Android 7.2.</p>\n<h2 id=\"dark-theme\">Dark Theme</h2>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/opa72/lock-screen.png' alt='Screenshot showing login screen with blue accents' title='Screenshot showing login screen with blue accents' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>The new feature I���m most excited about in 1Password also happens to be my favourite new feature in Android Q. When it launches later this summer, Android Q will bring support for a system-wide Dark Theme. And 1Password will be ready and waiting with our new gothic stylings.</p>\n<h2 id=\"i-only-work-in-blackand-sometimes-very-very-dark-grey\">I only work in black&hellip;and sometimes very, very dark grey.</h2>\n<p>While we did darken things dramatically, we didn&rsquo;t quite limit our palate to Bat-approved colours. Instead, we used the contrast provided by a dark background to really make important elements pop. Look for bold shots of 1Password blue to tell you where the action is.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-if-your-device-isnt-running-android-q\">What if your device isn&rsquo;t running Android Q?</h2>\n<p>This is the best part. Even old versions of Android support Dark Theme in 1Password, all the way back to Lollipop. On Android Q, 1Password will match your choice in the system setting by default, while earlier OS versions will default to Dark Theme when Battery Saver is enabled. In either case, you can override this behaviour with a quick visit to the display settings in 1Password.</p>\n<h2 id=\"enhanced-autofill-functionality\">Enhanced Autofill functionality</h2>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/opa72/create-login.png' alt='Screenshot showing login screen' title='Screenshot showing login screen' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>Not only does Dark Theme dazzle throughout the app, but it also asserts its sense of style in Autofill. Of course, you&rsquo;re probably more interested in how well Autofill works, rather than how great it looks. To that end, we&rsquo;ve added a couple of exciting improvements to help you out.</p>\n<p>Now, you can create new Login items using Autofill without having to double back to 1Password. Whether you���re signing in to an app or browser, Autofill prompts you with the option to create a new Login item. If you���re signing up for a new account, you can use the password generator.</p>\n<p>If that isn���t enough, we���ve enhanced Autofill to support more apps and websites with split-screen logins. Signing in is quicker and easier than ever.</p>\n<h2 id=\"manage-trashed-items-on-the-go\">Manage trashed items on the go</h2>\n<p>If you accidentally move an item to the trash, there���s no need to rush back to your computer. Simply navigate to your trashed items and restore the item with a single tap. On the other hand, if you���re confident that you don���t need the item, just empty the trash to purge it from your device.</p>\n<h2 id=\"honorable-mentions\">Honorable mentions</h2>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/opa72/password-history.png' alt='Screenshot showing password history' title='Screenshot showing password history' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>We���ve covered some of the biggest changes to 1Password 7.2, but there���s lots more to explore:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Add/remove additional website fields from logins</li>\n<li>View password history for Login and Password items</li>\n<li>Use 1Password in desktop mode with Samsung DeX</li>\n<li>Dozens of additional features, improvements, and fixes</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"rolling-out\">Rolling out</h2>\n<p>1Password 7.2 for Android is a free update for all 1Password customers. We���ve started rolling it out on Google Play, so keep an eye out for the update notification.

Screen Time has shown many of us that we perhaps spend a little too much time on our iPhones, but one thing that has definitely sped up our mobile interactions is Password AutoFill.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/password-autofill/autofill.gif' alt='Video showing how 1Password can fill credentials into Twitter&#39;s website' title='Video showing how 1Password can fill credentials into Twitter&#39;s website' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>To recap, Password AutoFill opened up the <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2017/206/\">filling technology included with iOS</a> to third-party developers, meaning that we could make filling your passwords even easier.</p>\n<p>When iOS 12 was announced back in June, <a href=\"https://blog.1password.com/wwdc18-presents-from-apple/\">we were there</a> in the audience of WWDC, and were thrilled to learn that we could now integrate 1Password directly into iOS. As soon as the keynote was finished, our developers jumped to work, and by dinner we already <a href=\"https://twitter.com/1Password/status/1003824297725460481\">had a working demo</a>.</p>\n<p>Skip forward three months and that demo has turned into a fully fledged feature, ready to transform how password filling works on iPhone and iPad.</p>\n<h2 id=\"love-and-praise-from-1password-users\">Love and praise from 1Password users</h2>\n<p>As soon as our customers began to update their devices, they got in touch to let us know how much they loved the feature.</p>\n<p>\n<div class=\"tweet\">\n<img src=\"https://blog.1password.com/img/icons/twitter.svg\" alt=\"@DeaNHtiD99 tweet\" />\n<p>\nAbsolutely love the new <a href=\"https://twitter.com/1Password\">@1Password</a> integration on iOS12.

Your password manager should give you more control over how you protect your data, not less. These beliefs guide everything we do as a business ��� including, most fundamentally, how we develop 1Password.</p>\n<h2 id=\"no-tracking-no-pixels-no-cookies\">No tracking, no pixels, no cookies</h2>\n<p>It���s standard practice in the tech industry to track everything. And to a point, it���s understandable: after all, app usage data makes it infinitely easier to optimise your product. Tracking pixels help you to use your marketing budget more efficiently, and customer profiling makes acquisition much simpler.</p>\n<p>But all this comes at a cost: your privacy. People trust us with their most valuable data, and it���s important to us to be worthy of that trust. That&rsquo;s why we don&rsquo;t <a href=\"https://support.1password.com/1password-privacy/\">collect any information about how you use 1Password</a>, and we don&rsquo;t have the slightest idea what you do within the 1Password apps.</p>\n<p>It might seem like an unconventional approach to decision-making, but it���s the right one for us. Would it be easier to track our customer&rsquo;s in-app activity and use data to figure out where to go next? Absolutely. But that���s not who we are, and it���s not what we do.</p>\n<p>A lot of companies see collecting data as the goal. We see it as a problem to deal with. The issue with data is that once a company has it, it���s very hard to get rid of it. That���s why we only collect the absolute minimum. We don���t know how you use 1Password, and we���re glad to not have that data.</p>\n<p>So, what do we do instead?</p>\n<h2 id=\"big-feedback-not-big-data\">Big feedback, not big data</h2>\n<p>We chart the course of our product development by listening to our customers. Really listening. Whether it���s through tweets, interview sessions, user testing, or customer support interactions, we���re always seeking out customer feedback.</p>\n<p>Every person at 1Password, including the directors, spends time each week answering customers who write in for support. The entire company makes an effort to understand what people like about the product, what needs improvement, and how people use 1Password.</p>\n<p>We try to understand every issue and listen to your stories. Many of these narratives are championed internally, which is how we decide on new features and product updates.</p>\n<p>We call this a feedback-first approach.</p>\n<h2 id=\"feedback-helps-us-to-help-you\">Feedback helps us to help you</h2>\n<p>Our customer service teams regularly report the feedback they receive. The product teams then take a close look at the results and quantify it. We then make judgments and development decisions based on that feedback. The product and design teams will often reach out to customers directly to help them work through their problems and find solutions.</p>\n<p>If we need specific or pointed feedback, or if the problem is more involved, we interview the people who use 1Password the most. We host customers in our office to demonstrate new and upcoming features. We also ask our sales team for their opinions, based on the interactions they���ve had in the past. After that, we weigh our options and make a call based on the feedback we���ve received from all these sources.</p>\n<p>Big data might be the industry standard, but we���ve never really cared what everybody else is doing. Our product development will always be driven by customer feedback. It���s the only way we collect data, because it���s the only way we can protect your privacy.</p>\n<section class=\"c-call-to-action-box c-call-to-action-box--background-author\">\n<div class=\"c-call-to-action-box__author\">\n<img src=\"https://blog.1password.com/img/authors/mattdavey.jpg\" class=\"c-call-to-action-box__author-image\" alt=\"Matt Davey\"/>\n</div>\n<div class=\"c-call-to-action-box__content\">\n<h3 class=\"c-call-to-action-box__title\">Share your feedback!</h3>\n<div class=\"c-call-to-action-box__text\">\nWe love to hear about your experiences with 1Password.

Today, it offers a browser extension and mobile app to prevent you from being tracked as you browse the web.</p>\n<p>Here are four key points from our chat with Daniel that will help to keep your business data safe and private.</p>\n<h2 id=\"make-privacy-a-priority\">Make privacy a priority</h2>\n<p>Customers and employees want to know that their <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/protecting-personal-information-guide-business\">personal information</a> is safe in your hands and on your servers. And as more companies go above and beyond to protect their customers��� privacy, competitive pressure is building for others to keep pace.</p>\n<p>With data leaks and breaches becoming more frequent, you need to show that <a href=\"http://customerthink.com/why-data-privacy-should-be-your-companys-top-priority/\">privacy is a priority for your business</a>. To do this, put together a privacy policy that is comprehensive, clear, and easily accessible. Be open and transparent with customers about exactly what information you���re storing, and how and where you store it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"evaluate-new-tools\">Evaluate new tools</h2>\n<p>Before you purchase or implement any new software, read the privacy policy carefully. If you&rsquo;re in Europe, any software that processes or stores your data must be GDPR compliant. If you&rsquo;re in the United States, software should comply with your state&rsquo;s privacy laws.</p>\n<h2 id=\"build-it-into-your-business\">Build it into your business</h2>\n<p>Almost weekly, a new privacy scandal hits the headlines. As a result, more people are aware of the risks to their data and are looking for ways to protect it. You can help by <a href=\"https://staysafeonline.org/blog/build-privacy-into-business/\">building privacy into the way your business operates</a>.</p>\n<p>Make sure privacy tools like safe search, browser extensions, and mobile apps are simple to use and fit your employees��� needs. Anything that is too complicated, or that disrupts their workflow, is likely to be ignored.</p>\n<h2 id=\"take-care-of-the-data\">Take care of the data</h2>\n<p>When handling your customers��� personal information, be clear about exactly what you���re collecting and why you���re collecting it. Never keep data that you don���t need, because if you don���t have it, you can���t lose it or be tricked into giving it away.</p>\n<p>Trust is the most valuable thing your customers can give you, so be transparent and keep them informed about any changes to your policies.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whats-up-next\">What&rsquo;s up next</h2>\n<p>If you enjoyed our chat with Daniel, <a href=\"https://1password.com/webinars/\">sign up for the webinar mailing list</a> to receive notifications of future webinars.</p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 30 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":10468,"bgimg":"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/duckduckgo-webinar/header.png","linkMd5":"7f371bb82149b1701b29b55015988857","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn17@2020_1/2020/08/25/00-54-55-348_e691108ae7e17d01.webp","destWidth":2080,"destHeight":800,"sourceBytes":80545,"destBytes":66032,"author":"Sarah Brown","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/duckduckgo-webinar/header.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn17@2020_1/2020/08/25/00-54-55-348_e691108ae7e17d01.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598316891415},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:54:51","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:54:51","title":"Connection, culture, and cruising in the Caribbean","link":"https://blog.1password.com/connection-culture-and-cruising/","description":"\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/agconf-video/header.png' class='webfeedsFeaturedVisual' alt='Connection, culture, and cruising in the Caribbean' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p class=\"introduction\">1Password is a fully remote company with people scattered across the globe ��� from New Zealand to Germany to our home in Canada.</p>\n<p>Late last month, we all met up for AGConf, our annual company gathering.

Instead of gathering in chat rooms and on conference calls, we���re able to spend time talking in person over food, drinks, games, and even while relaxing in a hot tub.</p>\n<p>Friends and partners are welcome too, and our new Chief Customer Advocate Lynette Kontny brought her husband Nathan along. He used the opportunity to cut some footage for his <a href=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/channel/UCkoJLANojCUUCsitmf8a3ug/featured\">daily vlog</a>. Nathan Kontny���s YouTube channel tackles important issues pertaining to business, family, and psychology in an engaging and thought-provoking way.</p>\n<p>The installment Nathan released after the cruise, ���Slack&rsquo;s Great.

This law (correctly) <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/12/new-fight-online-privacy-and-security-australia-falls-what-happens-next\">has many digital security and privacy experts worried</a>. We&rsquo;d like to offer some preliminary remarks on how it may impact the privacy and security of 1Password customers and how it may affect the way we work.</p>\n<p>Even at this early stage we can remind everyone that we do not currently, and will not introduce back doors into our products, and we will continue to operate in a way that would make it difficult for a back door to be inserted.</p>\n<p>Our remarks on the Assistance and Access Act (discussed under the hashtag #aaBill) must be preliminary at this point. There is a great deal of vagueness in the law in its current form, and we do not know how it will be interpreted and used when it goes into effect into effect. Nonetheless there are a number of things that we can clearly (re)state now.</p>\n<h2 id=\"we-dont-like-back-doors\">We don&rsquo;t like back doors</h2>\n<p>A back door is a deliberate and hidden weakness in a system that is designed to allow certain people to bypass the security of the system. We have argued on multiple occasions that not only do back doors weaken security for everyone, but that a system in which a back door can (easily) be inserted is inherently weaker than a system in which a back door cannot (easily) be inserted.</p>\n<p>This fact plays an important role in the design of 1Password and in how we build it. It is not that we are particularly worried about government-compelled back doors in practice. Instead, it is just a consequence of good security practices. The goal is not to specifically deny government lawful access; instead the goal is to protect people from criminal access, malicious insiders, accidental information disclosure, and a host of other things people have the right to be protected from. We are not trying to protect criminals from prosecution; we are trying to protect our customers from criminals.</p>\n<p>It is impossible to offer 100% guarantees against insider attacks, but <a href=\"https://blog.1password.com/1password-and-the-crypto-wars/\">as we wrote five years ago</a> (and recently updated), we do a number of things that make it substantially harder for back doors to be inserted into 1Password without detection. There is always room for improvement, and that improvement is an ongoing process.</p>\n<h2 id=\"compelled-insider-attackers\">Compelled insider attackers</h2>\n<p><strong>Correction 14 December, 2018:</strong> <em>My commentary below appears to be based on a misunderstanding of the law. The law, as passed, does not appear to authorize the government to compel an employee to surreptitiously work against our interests and without our knowledge. As always, the precise interpretation of the law will be determined by practice and courts, and so no one truly knows what it will mean. However, my error was large enough that it does need correction. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stilgherrian\">Stilgherrian</a> has written a <a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/whats-actually-in-australias-encryption-laws-everything-you-need-to-know/\" title=\"ZDnet: What's Actually in Australia's Encryption Laws\">good discussion clarifying #aaBill</a>.</em></p>\n<p>One of the most disturbing things about the Assistance and Access Act is that it apparently <del>authorizes the Australian government to compel someone subject to its laws to surreptitiously take actions that harm our customers&rsquo; privacy and security without revealing that to us.</del> Would an Australian employee of 1Password be forced to lie to us and do something that we would definitely object to?</p>\n<p>We do not, at this point, know whether it will be necessary or useful to place extra monitoring on people working for 1Password who may be subject to Australian laws. Our existing security and privacy design and internal controls may well be sufficient without adding additional controls on our people in Australia. Nor do we yet know to what extent we should consider Australian nationality in hiring decisions. It may be a long time before any such internal policies and practices go into place, if they ever do, but these are discussions we have been forced to have.</p>\n<p>Despite those considerations and discussions, our primary response and tactic is to continue to make it hard for anyone, whether inside or outside of 1Password, to harm customers&rsquo; security and privacy. That is what we do to protect our customers from any adversary, and that is what we will continue to do.</p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 11 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":10468,"bgimg":"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/aabill/header.png","linkMd5":"3d1f723adc9e6346c81fb6beaeda88b4","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn81@2020_5/2020/08/25/00-54-55-000_00544950d7900b0a.webp","destWidth":2080,"destHeight":800,"sourceBytes":28343,"destBytes":35306,"author":"Jeffrey Goldberg","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/aabill/header.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn81@2020_5/2020/08/25/00-54-55-000_00544950d7900b0a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598316891416},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:54:51","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:54:51","title":"World Press Freedom Day: 1Password for Journalism","link":"https://blog.1password.com/world-press-freedom-day-1password-journalism/","description":"\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/freedom-press/header.png' class='webfeedsFeaturedVisual' alt='World Press Freedom Day: 1Password for Journalism' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p class=\"introduction\">It���s not an easy time to be a journalist, which is why we want to recognize World Press Freedom Day. On this crucial day, we celebrate the freedom of the press, defend and support the independence of journalists, and honor those who have lost their lives while reporting a story.</p>\n<p>Journalists are increasingly under attack, thanks to the proliferation of fake news and direct attacks from celebrities and those in power. What���s more, dwindling salaries and budgets for newspapers, websites, and magazines translate to fewer resources to tell important and necessary stories. Journalists are being laid off in huge numbers at a time that a free and independent media is more crucial than ever.</p>\n<h2 id=\"introducing-1password-for-journalism\">Introducing 1Password for Journalism</h2>\n<p>We know just how vital journalists are to the fabric of our society and how stretched their resources can be. Journalists often put their reputations and their lives on the line to report stories. This means that they are often targets for doxxing, harassment, hacking, and other security nightmares.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>With website data breaches and leaks containing users&rsquo; passwords happening regularly to even the largest tech companies in the world, it&rsquo;s more important than ever to have strong, unique passwords per website. Usernames and passwords are being sold between hackers and are used for social engineering. While this is catastrophic for anyone, it is especially critical for journalists, to protect their sources and do their work in a safe environment.</em> �����<strong>Arne Grauls, European Journalism Centre</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is why we offer 1Password for Journalism, which is a 1Password membership for reporters that is <em>completely free</em>.

But it can do much, much more than that. Your vault can hold files, notes, and contacts you want to store securely; what���s more, all of your data is end-to-end encrypted.</p>\n<p>You can also take advantage of 1Password���s <a href=\"https://support.1password.com/travel-mode/\">Travel Mode</a> feature through your free 1Password for Journalism membership. Before you cross borders, you can mark vaults that are safe for travel. When you activate Travel Mode, the vaults which were not flagged as safe will be removed from your device. Once you turn Travel Mode off and connect to the internet, your vaults will be restored.</p>\n<p>Travel Mode, along with features like <a href=\"https://support.1password.com/watchtower/\">Watchtower</a>, which alerts you if your passwords have been compromised in a data breach, are just a few ways that 1Password can help journalists stay safe online. If you haven���t signed up for your free 1Password for Journalism membership, take a few minutes on this World Press Freedom Day to let us help you become more secure in your online life.</p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 03 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":10468,"bgimg":"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/freedom-press/header.png","linkMd5":"71a48ab70d661645342a35841a548b1b","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn30@2020_1/2020/08/25/00-54-55-492_e631486a0ba0e192.webp","destWidth":2080,"destHeight":800,"sourceBytes":73058,"destBytes":60028,"author":"Swapna Krishna","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/freedom-press/header.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn30@2020_1/2020/08/25/00-54-55-492_e631486a0ba0e192.webp","https://blog.1password.com/img/authors/swapnakrishna.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn60@2020_6/2020/08/25/00-55-01-942_cfdade1a1d4a2a11.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598316891416},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:54:51","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:54:51","title":"Improve your team���s security with our next webinar","link":"https://blog.1password.com/improve-your-teams-security-with-our-next-webinar/","description":"\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/admin-webinar/header.png' class='webfeedsFeaturedVisual' alt='Improve your team���s security with our next webinar' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p class=\"introduction\">As we move into the second half of 2019, it&rsquo;s a great time to re-evaluate your team&rsquo;s security habits.

But your culture is defined by how you handle difficult situations ��� these are the moments it&rsquo;s both tested and formed. We hope our experiences will help you build a remote culture that empowers your team to do great work.</p>\n<h2 id=\"be-kind-and-empathetic\">Be kind and empathetic</h2>\n<p>We recognise that our folks are all dealing with a spectrum of exceptional circumstances ��� family sickness, financial pressures, <a href=\"https://blog.1password.com/remote-work-security-people/\">childcare issues</a>, and more. Even though we���re 14-year veterans of remote work, we���re aware that right now we have to <a href=\"https://blog.1password.com/remote-work-mental-health/\">slow down and prioritise mental health</a>, and give everyone the space and time they need.</p>\n<p>Leaders need to take the helm here. During our all-hands call, Jeff (our CEO) let everyone know it���s absolutely okay that productivity isn���t going to be 100%. Our focus should be staying safe and healthy. When important messages come directly from the top, there���s less room for misinterpretation and teams are more likely to take advice on board. If you���re new to remote working, this is more important than ever.</p>\n<h2 id=\"trust-your-team\">Trust your team</h2>\n<p>Remote working lays the groundwork for a real cornerstone of healthy culture ��� trust. Working flexible hours means we can work when we���re at our most productive. We trust each other to show up and do a good job, and no one wants to break that. Ultimately, we all want to make 1Password as good as it can be.</p>\n<p>Even when the world is more testing, we trust that everyone is doing their best. And, right now, everyone���s best looks different. If your team is <a href=\"https://blog.com/remote-work-tips/\">newly remote</a>, encourage people to experiment with different ways and schedules of working. There will be an adjustment period, but it&rsquo;ll quickly pay off as people figure out what works for them. In more settled times, you���ll see a more productive workforce. Today, hopefully, you���ll have a healthier one.</p>\n<p>In short, relax. If you trust people, they���ll feel valued and respected, and want to keep your trust.</p>\n<h2 id=\"encourage-connections\">Encourage connections</h2>\n<p>We���re lucky to have the opportunity to meet, work (and then hang out with) folks from diverse backgrounds from all over the world. Yes, this happens while working together, but often, it&rsquo;s the informal, unstructured chats that hold the most value to team wellbeing. We have happy hour video calls where colleagues can shoot the breeze with a beer, play online sessions of Settlers of Catan, and share endless Animal Crossing screenshots in our #topic-gaming chat in Slack.</p>\n<p>These are the kinds of interactions that happen in bricks and mortar workplaces (or in the pub after work) but they can be supercharged using remote-friendly technology. Your teams will find their rhythm. Focus on cultivating a culture where communication between team members is encouraged, but not mandated.</p>\n<p>When connections form naturally, they���re real and long-lasting. And teams that communicate well will work better together, be happier, and love their jobs. You&rsquo;ll see lower staff turnover, more engaged team members and potentially even find it easier to recruit new staff because of your company culture. That���s been our experience at 1Password.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tldr\">TL;DR</h2>\n<p>When it comes to culture, what matters most is intent ��� and that needs to be genuine. Build a work environment that encourages productivity rather than enforces it; one that fosters communication without demanding it; and one that is thoughtful, inclusive and, above all, kind.</p>\n<section class=\"c-call-to-action-box c-call-to-action-box--background-author\">\n<div class=\"c-call-to-action-box__author\">\n<img src=\"https://blog.1password.com/img/authors/mattdavey.jpg\" class=\"c-call-to-action-box__author-image\" alt=\"Matt Davey\"/>\n</div>\n<div class=\"c-call-to-action-box__content\">\n<h3 class=\"c-call-to-action-box__title\">Get more security tips</h3>\n<div class=\"c-call-to-action-box__text\">\nSign up to our business security mailing list and get advice on running a secure, productive workplace delivered directly to your inbox.\n</div>\n<form accept-charset=\"UTF-8\" action=\"https://agilemail.createsend.com/t/r/s/ohlyduj/\" class=\"oneline\" data-event-category=\"Newsletter\" data-event-action=\"form-newsletter\" id=\"newsletterForm\" method=\"post\">\n<div id=\"hidden-fields\"><input name=\"utf8\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"���\"><input name=\"authenticity_token\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"B2cHFMPBG0KjOnROQ884zCYcI0afwrAx897/qCCfum0=\"></div>\n<input class=\"c-call-to-action-box__newsletter-email\" id=\"cm-ohlyduj-ohlyduj\" name=\"cm-ohlyduj-ohlyduj\" type=\"email\" placeholder=\"wendy@appleseed.com\">\n<input class=\"c-call-to-action-box__newsletter-button\" type=\"submit\" value=\"Sign up\">\n</form>\n</div>\n</section>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 27 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":10468,"bgimg":"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2020/remote-culture/header.png","linkMd5":"594863bfd2b3864d5b2c16cad305b63f","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn97@2020_1/2020/08/25/00-54-53-431_cff752c394794e61.webp","destWidth":2080,"destHeight":800,"sourceBytes":33104,"destBytes":41152,"author":"Matt Davey","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2020/remote-culture/header.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn97@2020_1/2020/08/25/00-54-53-431_cff752c394794e61.webp","https://blog.1password.com/img/authors/mattdavey.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn60@2020_1/2020/08/25/00-55-04-936_81dfd9bc82da4099.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598316891414},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:54:51","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:54:51","title":"Let's all go to the park - introducing 1Password Park","link":"https://blog.1password.com/lets-all-go-to-the-park-introducing-1password-park/","description":"<img src=\"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/1password-park/header.png\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual\" alt=\"Let\" s=\"\" all=\"\" go=\"\" to=\"\" the=\"\" park=\"\" -=\"\" introducing=\"\" 1Password=\"\" Park'=\"\" style=\"max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;\" /> \n<p class=\"introduction\">1Password was born and raised in Canada, with an amazing team of people working around the world to continue development and provide support to all our customers.</p> \n<p>Last Christmas, we wanted to help provide food security to those in need, and donated $50,000 to Food Banks throughout Ontario, where our Founders are based.

I&rsquo;ve been working with a small team to build CSX, a Chrome extension that makes providing support as easy as 1Password makes managing your passwords.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-do-we-need-a-tool-like-csx\">Why do we need a tool like CSX?</h2>\n<p>As 1Password grows, so do the number of customers we talk to. To make sure we have time to give every reply the thought it deserves, we wanted to automate the repetitive, more administrative parts of the process.</p>\n<p>For example, we&rsquo;ll often get an email that mentions a forum thread or Twitter conversation. Finding that discussion is a repetitive, time-consuming endeavor, and it would be much better if we could spend that time crafting our reply.</p>\n<p>To give one more example, we have a collection of &ldquo;Charms&rdquo;, which let a new team member know how to write the perfect response for every situation. These are new to us and we&rsquo;ll likely write about them in the future, but suffice it to say, they help us ensure that every customer gets the same special treatment. It&rsquo;s easy to forget to look for these, especially since the collection changes over time. It would be great if our tools could do the searching on a team member&rsquo;s behalf.</p>\n<p>These are just some of the reasons why building a tool like CSX was important to us. I could go on, but I&rsquo;d much rather show you the result!</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/csx/main-widget.png' alt='Main CSX widget displaying information about customer' title='Main CSX widget displaying information about customer' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<h2 id=\"meet-csx\">Meet CSX</h2>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s CSX&rsquo;s main widget, helpfully displayed beside an email. Immediately, you can see that we&rsquo;ve identified the most relevant customer to the conversation, and surfaced information that might help us craft the perfect response. Let&rsquo;s talk about each of these in more detail&hellip;</p>\n<h3 id=\"accounts\">Accounts</h3>\n<p>CSX is authenticated with 1Password.com, and is able to retrieve service data about a customer&rsquo;s accounts. What&rsquo;s shown is a summary of the most important details - the region they&rsquo;re in, how recently they&rsquo;ve accessed 1Password on a device, and how they&rsquo;re paying for the service.</p>\n<p>With this information, we&rsquo;ll notice if you&rsquo;re paying with an Apple Subscription, and change our billing advice accordingly. Or that you signed up on 1Password.eu, which explains why you can&rsquo;t sign in on 1Password.com.</p>\n<h3 id=\"order-information\">Order Information</h3>\n<p>Through integrations with third-party APIs, we look for licences you might have on our old WebStore or on FastSpring, which we use for 1Password 7. This helps us identify which version of 1Password you&rsquo;re licensed to use, and gives us more information about your purchase if we need it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"other-context\">Other Context</h3>\n<p>CSX also shows if you&rsquo;re active on the 1Password Support forum, or if you have other conversations open in Cerb, our email tool. This helps us choose where to put our response, and ensures that we only respond in one place.</p>\n<h3 id=\"charms\">Charms</h3>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/csx/charms.png' alt='CSX displaying Charms relevant to a conversation' title='CSX displaying Charms relevant to a conversation' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>This one is exciting! Charms are essentially guides for writing the perfect answer to a customer with a particular question. We show relevant Charms based on the &ldquo;Bucket&rdquo; your email is routed to, using our own API that exposes Charms to the extension.</p>\n<h3 id=\"slack\">Slack</h3>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/csx/slack.png' alt='CSX showing a Slack question about a feature request' title='CSX showing a Slack question about a feature request' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>Being a remote company, Slack is vital for internal communication. Through integration with the Slack API, CSX can search for discussions about a particular question, and surface them in a widget just under the main one. This means we won&rsquo;t waste time asking the same question twice. Notice that we also show who&rsquo;s replied - this can indicate at a glance if we have an authoritative answer, or if there&rsquo;s just been a small amount of discussion.</p>\n<p>We also allow our team to ask questions directly from CSX. Based on the bucket your email was routed to, we&rsquo;ll pick the best Slack channel for your question. Every message is handcrafted by CSX to show relevant context, leading to answers in the quickest time possible.</p>\n<h3 id=\"filling-issues\">Filling Issues</h3>\n<p>If there&rsquo;s one thing that Dave ��� the Heart &amp; Soul of 1Password ��� loves to say, it&rsquo;s that filling is our bread and butter. We want to help our team take action whenever you tell us that filling isn&rsquo;t perfect. Links that you send us are highlighted if there are known problems, and if there aren&rsquo;t any, filing the issue for investigation can be done with a click.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/csx/filling-issue.png' alt='A filling issue displayed inline as part of an email' title='A filling issue displayed inline as part of an email' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<h3 id=\"twitter\">Twitter</h3>\n<p>Twitter is a popular way to reach out to us, and I understand why. I love being able to speak to a company quickly, without needing to dig out their email address or open my email client. That said, email is better for some discussions. In the past, when we asked a customer to email us, we lost everything that had been said so far. To fix that, we made CSX add a &ldquo;Move to Cerb&rdquo; button to our Twitter client. This creates a new conversation in Cerb with details about our chat on Twitter, so we don&rsquo;t have to search for a needle in the Twitter haystack.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/csx/twitter.png' alt='Move to Cerb button in our Twitter client' title='Move to Cerb button in our Twitter client' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<h2 id=\"our-forums\">Our Forums</h2>\n<p>CSX isn&rsquo;t limited to email. Our forum is a hotspot for questions, too, so we find the email associated with a thread&rsquo;s author and use that to show as much information as we can. Since this is a public discussion, we have to be more careful about what we share. That said, the context can still be useful if we don&rsquo;t quite understand something you&rsquo;ve said.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whats-next\">What&rsquo;s next?</h2>\n<p>I honestly couldn&rsquo;t say! Ultimately, we&rsquo;ll pick whatever benefits our customers the most. Our thoughts on what that is may change as we explore all the ideas we have.</p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 07 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":10468,"bgimg":"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/csx/header.png","linkMd5":"67fea835679ef1400846cf1d6cf608fa","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn86@2020_4/2020/08/25/00-54-52-368_052f77aebc4a14d4.webp","destWidth":2080,"destHeight":800,"sourceBytes":56257,"destBytes":53628,"author":"Oliver Dunk","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/csx/header.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn86@2020_4/2020/08/25/00-54-52-368_052f77aebc4a14d4.webp","https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/csx/main-widget.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn4@2020_2/2020/08/25/00-55-04-083_a05eee2af8b92c5f.webp","https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/csx/charms.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn4@2020_2/2020/08/25/00-55-09-631_acd73bb20cbc6545.webp","https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/csx/slack.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn88@2020_5/2020/08/25/00-55-12-758_7270910d0080d63a.webp","https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/csx/filling-issue.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn36@2020_4/2020/08/25/00-55-00-900_55bb4c47715b7448.webp","https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/csx/twitter.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn60@2020_3/2020/08/25/00-55-01-207_760719db6734f257.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598316891416},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:54:51","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:54:51","title":"Bruce Schneier on bridging the gap between policy and tech","link":"https://blog.1password.com/bruce-schneier-talks-web-security/","description":"\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/bruce-schneier-qa/header.png' class='webfeedsFeaturedVisual' alt='Bruce Schneier on bridging the gap between policy and tech' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p class=\"introduction\">Last week on Random But Memorable, renowned security technologist <a href=\"https://www.schneier.com/\">Bruce Schneier</a> joined me to discuss surveillance capitalism and internet security policy. Read the interview, or <a href=\"https://randombutmemorable.simplecast.com/episodes/scrambled-hidden-potato-device\">listen to the full podcast</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Michael:</strong> Bruce, you don���t need an introduction, but I���m going to give you the opportunity to give one anyway. Welcome to the show.</p>\n<p><strong>Bruce:</strong> Hi. People might not know that I now teach internet security policy at the Harvard Kennedy School. I���m trying to teach a little bit of tech to policy students, and internet policy to techies. I���m trying to bridge the gap between policy and tech. Our serious problems are how do we govern tech, and what is the governance of tech. We need people who can speak both languages.</p>\n<p><strong>Michael:</strong> So often these days we have rules and laws being put in place that aren���t necessarily based in reality or practical matter.</p>\n<p><strong>Bruce:</strong> Did you watch the Facebook hearings? If legislators ask questions like ���How does Facebook make money?��� we���re not going to get good internet security policy.</p>\n<p><strong>Michael:</strong> It seems like every company these days is creating and selling data and metadata about us. Then other companies are buying it up, or it���s being made public through accidental breaches. Do you think this notion of companies trading and being careless with our data makes us more careless as consumers?</p>\n<p><strong>Bruce:</strong> Shoshana Zuboff calls this ���<a href=\"https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2019/03/harvard-professor-says-surveillance-capitalism-is-undermining-democracy/\">surveillance capitalism</a>.��� It���s a new way businesses are monetizing information about us. It���s both companies that do it as a primary revenue source ��� the Facebooks and Googles, and all the other companies that sell you appliances, toys, and other services. They realize they have a data revenue stream. It is everywhere. It seems like the new form of capitalism.</p>\n<p>I���m not sure it makes us more careless. I think a lot of us are resigned to it. Companies go out of their way to make it not salient, so we don���t think about it. Certainly, when we think about it, we���re concerned. It seems like from surveys, it���s less that we care less or are careless. It���s that we think it���s inevitable and don���t see viable alternatives.</p>\n<p>If I tell people, ���If you want to protect your privacy, you should not have an email address, carry a cell phone, or use a credit card,��� that���s fundamentally dumb advice. You can���t live in the 21st century, first-world countries without engaging in those technologies. So people are deleting their Facebook accounts more and more, but for a lot of people, they need to be on Facebook for socialization. A lot of people are resigned to it. That���s where I look at government as the missing link, because it���s not going to be consumer rebellions that change surveillance capitalism. It���ll be rules and laws.</p>\n<p><strong>Michael:</strong> I don���t think people deleting their Facebook accounts in 2019 is necessarily going to hurt Facebook���s bottom line.</p>\n<p><strong>Bruce:</strong> Especially if they use Instagram instead.</p>\n<p><strong>Michael:</strong> I would think most people don���t even realize that Instagram is owned by Facebook.</p>\n<p><strong>Bruce:</strong> Facebook doesn���t keep it a secret, but they don���t advertise it. I think they���re playing that game.</p>\n<p><strong>Michael:</strong> Do you think it���s possible to opt out of this type of life?</p>\n<p><strong>Bruce:</strong> You can build a cabin in the woods, be off the grid, and not have any communications. It���s possible. It���s just not reasonable to expect.</p>\n<p>If you were interviewing me five or ten years ago, we would talk about protecting your data on your computer, and how you could have better security. But now our data isn���t even on our computers. Our mail is on Google���s computers. Our photos are on someone else���s site. When these security breaches happen, they don���t happen to us. They happen to companies like Marriott, and our information is lost or stolen, and there���s nothing we can do about it.</p>\n<p>Even if you try to opt out, your data is not under your control anymore. That makes it even harder. My email is not on Google���s servers, but probably about half of my email is, because everybody else���s email is on Google���s servers. So here I am opting out from Gmail, but I���m not really opting out because I can���t.</p>\n<p><strong>Michael:</strong> And we���re beyond opting out of social media. You can not be on Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram, but these breaches go well beyond that data that you would voluntarily share.</p>\n<p><strong>Bruce:</strong> Social media is really how we interact with our colleagues. I am not on Facebook, and I notice the lapse socially. I occasionally find businesses who don���t have a website ��� just a Facebook page. There is a cost for not being on these platforms. Sometimes you���re willing to pay it, and sometimes you���re not.</p>\n<p><strong>Michael:</strong> If you look at 1Password, we handle people���s data like nuclear waste. We limit who touches it, and we only ask for what we need. We treat our customers��� data with as much care as humanly possible. But this is not the trend.</p>\n<p><strong>Bruce:</strong> No, because it���s expensive. Password management is inherently, ���We want to be more secure because it���s the things that secure other things.��� But you move to other data, and you���re not going to make those kinds of tradeoffs.</p>\n<p>You can go further. I have a password manager, and I deliberately don���t let anybody put anything in the cloud ever. But I���m sacrificing a feature, because if your data is in the cloud, you can sync over different devices. We���re all making these tradeoffs of usability versus security.</p>\n<p><strong>Michael:</strong> Where do you draw that distinction?</p>\n<p><strong>Bruce:</strong> You draw it where you make it. A typical business is going to draw the line where it makes financial sense. Let���s use your typical retailer as an example. If they are not going to lose customers because of bad security, they���re not going to worry about it too much.</p>\n<p>Yahoo is pretty famous for skimping on security because it didn���t matter to them financially, but if you look at a program that advertises security, it���s going to be more of a reputational thing. For a bank, security is going to be money. They���re going to spend more to protect the money they would lose otherwise. Everybody is making their tradeoffs based on usability, profits, and regulations.</p>\n<p><strong>Michael:</strong> Do you think there���s a way to set a new baseline in people���s mindsets for what security should be when it comes to handling personal data?</p>\n<p><strong>Bruce:</strong> Maybe, but it���s pretty opaque. You could call Facebook and ask, ���How do you handle my data,��� and they���re not going to tell you. None of these companies will, because they don���t want to make that public.</p>\n<p>I don���t see a consumer-led push to increase security, just like you don���t have consumer-led pushes to increase safety in pretty much anything. It is a government-led push because that���s where you have the information to make intelligent decisions that ratchet up safety. I think you might have a generic, ���We want more security for our data,��� that will lead to government regulation. We saw that in Europe with <a href=\"https://eugdpr.org/\">GDPR</a>. The government set the rules because there was the political will to do that.</p>\n<p><strong>Michael:</strong> You can debate the merits of having government involved in setting those types of laws.</p>\n<p><strong>Bruce:</strong> You can, but I���m not sure what the alternative is. The alternative is nothing. The alternative is what we have today in the U.S. ��� an absolute free for all.</p>\n<p><strong>Michael:</strong> What do you think are some of the best ways to improve password habits?</p>\n<p><strong>Bruce:</strong> We know that people are terrible at choosing passwords. We���re at the point where pretty much anything you can remember can be hacked, so we want people to choose unmemorable passwords. I think a password manager is essential because we need some system that will remember them for you.</p>\n<p>There is also a system for choosing unbreakable passwords that you can remember. Basically, I tell people to craft a sentence and use it as a way to generate the password. Take the first letter of every word, and then add some number and letter substitutions, extra punctuation, or weird capitalization. You remember the sentence��� it���s something memorable from your life that���s personal. I suggest a sentence that you���d be embarrassed to write down, because they are easier to remember, and you���re less likely to write it down. Then you remember the production rule of how to turn that sentence into the password. Use that for high-value passwords, like the password for your password manager.</p>\n<p>Also, turn on two-factor authentication whenever you can and it matters. Anything where there���s money, your reputation, or personal information involved, you want to turn those features on.</p>\n<p><strong>Michael:</strong> One last thing to wrap it up here. What do you think we need to see as a societal change in regards to security or privacy? What���s something you���re hoping we see in our lifetime?</p>\n<p><strong>Bruce:</strong> The thing that is missing for security and privacy writ large, whether it���s our data privacy, internet of things security, or our national cybersecurity is involvement of government. That is who has abdicated their role. This will only work if everybody is working together, pushing against each other to figure out optimal strategies. We have corporations running the show, so it���s optimized for profit and not security. If you want to fix that, you have to bring government back.</p>\n<p>I think it���s inevitable. Governments regulate dangerous things. Once the internet starts killing people, government will be involved, but it really shouldn���t take that. We���re starting to see some movement in that direction, most notably in Europe, but the U.S. is so anti-government involvement that we are hurting ourselves and producing very suboptimal solutions.</p>\n<p><strong>Michael:</strong> And that brings us back to where we started, which is your efforts to educate future policymakers.</p>\n<p><strong>Bruce:</strong> And to convince technologists to become part of policy. It���s not just a matter of making sure legislators and regulators understand tech. It���s getting people who do understand tech to take a couple of years in their career and work on policy, advise, speak, or write. There are lots of ways we can engage, and we���re just not doing it.</p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 30 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":10468,"bgimg":"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/bruce-schneier-qa/header.png","linkMd5":"f57c5d5b83a5c26f5b24ba89882fb03d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn57@2020_5/2020/08/25/00-54-53-288_2d440918f504aea0.webp","destWidth":7003,"destHeight":2694,"sourceBytes":164030,"destBytes":216316,"author":"Michael Fey","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/bruce-schneier-qa/header.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn57@2020_5/2020/08/25/00-54-53-288_2d440918f504aea0.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598316891416},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:54:51","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:54:51","title":"1Password X 1.8: The Independence Update for Chrome and Firefox","link":"https://blog.1password.com/1password-x-1.8-the-independence-update-for-chrome-and-firefox/","description":"\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/b5x1.8/header.png' class='webfeedsFeaturedVisual' alt='1Password X 1.8: The Independence Update for Chrome and Firefox' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p class=\"introduction\">A massive release with credit card and two-factor authentication code filling, password generator history, and a whole lot more.</p>\n<p>What is 1Password X?

Here's how to keep your team secure","link":"https://blog.1password.com/remote-work-security-tips/","description":"\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2020/remote-security/header.png' class='webfeedsFeaturedVisual' alt='New to remote working? Here's how to keep your team secure' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p class=\"introduction\">Many businesses are having to rush to remote working for the first time, but it&rsquo;s important <a href=\"https://blog.1password.com/remote-work-security-people/\">not to let your security slide</a> during the transition. By taking a few simple precautions, working from home can be as secure as working from an office. These tips will help your whole team work from home safely, wherever they are in the world.</p>\n<h2 id=\"hardware\">Hardware</h2>\n<p>The first thing is to make sure you work with devices set up to keep company information safe.</p>\n<p><strong>Use the safest device available.</strong>\nIf your computers are provided by work, use them. If they���re not, make sure you work from your own device. Don���t work from public computers, or computers belonging to friends, family or anyone else ��� these could be insecure in any number of ways. If it���s possible to designate a computer solely to work, it���s a good idea to do that.</p>\n<p><strong>Set up device passwords.</strong>\nMake sure all devices you work with are password protected. If someone finds one unattended, you don���t want them to be able to use it.</p>\n<p><strong>Encrypt storage.</strong>\nThe devices you use should also be set up with full disk encryption so any data stored on them is kept as safe as possible, even if someone were to steal the laptop or obtain a copy of the data. Most current operating systems support the encryption of device storage.</p>\n<p><strong>Keep software up to date.</strong>\nMake sure you keep all software up to date on the devices you work with. That���s everything from the operating system to the apps you use, whether for work or personally. If possible, set operating systems and apps to automatically update. This will make sure any software vulnerabilities are patched as soon as possible.</p>\n<p><strong>Keep hardware safe.</strong>\nIf you ever need to work outside of home, there are steps you can take to keep company information and property safe:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Angle screens so they���re harder for other people to see, and invest in a screen protector.</li>\n<li>Lock screens when away from a device, even if it���s only for a moment.</li>\n<li>Never leave a device in a car.</li>\n<li>Keep devices close at all times.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"software\">Software</h2>\n<p>Use only the software you���re cleared to use on work machines. This includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Web browsers</li>\n<li>Browser extensions</li>\n<li>Word processing software</li>\n<li>Communication apps</li>\n<li>Project management software</li>\n<li>Developer and other specialist tools</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Use a dedicated work browser.</strong>\nThese days, a lot of work is done in the web browser. If you don���t have a dedicated work computer, it���s a good idea to have one dedicated web browser (or browser profile) for work and another for personal use. On your work browser, make sure you only use allowed browser extensions. This helps keep work-oriented accounts and data secure.</p>\n<h2 id=\"network\">Network</h2>\n<p>Most modern home networks are fairly secure, but there are some basic steps you should take to keep company information as safe as possible.</p>\n<p><strong>Update routers.</strong>\nYour home router may not have been updated in some time. Check your firmware and apply any outstanding updates. If you���ll be working remotely for the long-term, make sure you update your router at least once per year. Keeping firmware up to date will patch any exploits to keep your network as secure as possible.</p>\n<p><strong>Change default passwords.</strong>\nIt���s also possible that you���ve never gotten round to changing the default administrator password on your router. Theoretically, this is as good as giving away network administration rights to anyone (or anything) who���s ever had access to the Wi-Fi network. Make sure you change your default router password if you never have.</p>\n<p><strong>Be safe on public networks.</strong>\nThese days, many websites use secure data transfer making public Wi-Fi safer than it used to be. Look for the lock in your browser address bar to make sure the site you���re on uses encryption ��� especially if you���re sharing any personal data, including your login details. If you���re working outside of the home or using an untrusted network, it���s still a good idea to use a virtual private network (VPN) or a personal hotspot to protect against any network vulnerabilities.</p>\n<h2 id=\"data\">Data</h2>\n<p>We���ve looked at various steps you can take to help keep company data safe. But there are also things to consider when it comes to the data itself.</p>\n<p><strong>Avoid downloading information.</strong>\nAs far as possible, don���t download any important, sensitive, or confidential information, especially if it���s about your customers. Regularly check what data you���re storing locally and permanently delete anything that isn���t needed. Where possible, work using secure cloud applications where access can be properly controlled and monitored. And working in the cloud means you never have to worry about backing up your data.</p>\n<p><strong>Use the right tools.</strong>\nIf you need to share confidential information, make sure you use a secure method. We���re offering <a href=\"https://blog.1password.com/covid-19-response/\">1Password Business free for six months</a>, so that companies can share passwords and other important information securely while working remotely.</p>\n<h2 id=\"support-your-team\">Support your team</h2>\n<p><strong>Use technical support.</strong>\nIf you���re not sure about any of these steps, don���t suffer in silence. Contact your work IT department or technical support team. They should be able to help.</p>\n<p><strong>Create a remote working handbook.</strong>\nDone right, remote working can be a productive and rewarding experience for everyone. You can help set your team up for success by creating a remote working handbook.</p>\n<section class=\"c-call-to-action-box c-call-to-action-box--background-author\">\n<div class=\"c-call-to-action-box__author\">\n<img src=\"https://blog.1password.com/img/authors/jamesholloway.jpg\" class=\"c-call-to-action-box__author-image\" alt=\"James Holloway\"/>\n</div>\n<div class=\"c-call-to-action-box__content\">\n<h3 class=\"c-call-to-action-box__title\">Get more security tips</h3>\n<div class=\"c-call-to-action-box__text\">\nSign up to our business security mailing list and get advice on running a secure, productive workplace delivered directly to your inbox.\n</div>\n<form accept-charset=\"UTF-8\" action=\"https://agilemail.createsend.com/t/r/s/ohlyduj/\" class=\"oneline\" data-event-category=\"Newsletter\" data-event-action=\"form-newsletter\" id=\"newsletterForm\" method=\"post\">\n<div id=\"hidden-fields\"><input name=\"utf8\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"���\"><input name=\"authenticity_token\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"B2cHFMPBG0KjOnROQ884zCYcI0afwrAx897/qCCfum0=\"></div>\n<input class=\"c-call-to-action-box__newsletter-email\" id=\"cm-ohlyduj-ohlyduj\" name=\"cm-ohlyduj-ohlyduj\" type=\"email\" placeholder=\"wendy@appleseed.com\">\n<input class=\"c-call-to-action-box__newsletter-button\" type=\"submit\" value=\"Sign up\">\n</form>\n</div>\n</section>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Mon, 23 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":10468,"bgimg":"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2020/remote-security/header.png","linkMd5":"fa4bcfcc59fc72508b14ba1264fffd5b","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn69@2020_6/2020/08/25/00-54-51-781_300200c4354c060f.webp","destWidth":2080,"destHeight":800,"sourceBytes":52765,"destBytes":47138,"author":"James Holloway","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2020/remote-security/header.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn69@2020_6/2020/08/25/00-54-51-781_300200c4354c060f.webp","https://blog.1password.com/img/authors/jamesholloway.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn17@2020_6/2020/08/25/00-54-57-534_f643b446ec9c5ac2.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598316891414},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:54:51","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:54:51","title":"Introducing 1Password 7.4 for Android","link":"https://blog.1password.com/android-january-release/","description":"\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2020/opa74/header.png' class='webfeedsFeaturedVisual' alt='Introducing 1Password 7.4 for Android' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p class=\"introduction\">Congratulations on making it through January with some of your New Year&rsquo;s resolutions intact! While you���ve been sticking to your new exercise routine and drinking healthy smoothies, we���ve been blending up something new for you as well. And although convenience and security don���t make very tasty drink ingredients, they sure do go well with 1Password.</p>\n<p>Now I could try to introduce the hallmark features with words, but why do that when our What&rsquo;s New screen does it so much better?</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2020/opa74/Whats-New.png' alt='What&#39;s New in Android' title='What&#39;s New in Android' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<h2 id=\"create-vaults-on-the-go\">Create vaults on the go</h2>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2020/opa74/New-Vault.png' alt='Create a new vault' title='Create a new vault' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>Vaults are great for organizing the items in your account at a very high level. For example, you may want to store all your travel essentials in one vault and your tax documents in an entirely different vault. In this update, you can exercise that desire to organize even while on the go. In just a few taps from the vault menu, ycreate a new vault, give it a fitting name, and choose a unique icon. And with that, it���s now ready to store your latest secrets!</p>\n<h2 id=\"preview-your-logins-with-autofill\">Preview your logins with Autofill</h2>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2020/opa74/Autofill-Preview-Step1.png' alt='Autofill preview' title='Autofill preview' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>When you visit the sign-in page of a website or an app, it���s helpful to know whether you already have a login available to autofill or whether you need to create a new one. To enjoy this convenience, go to Settings &gt; Autofill and turn on Autofill previews.</p>\n<p>After you���ve turned on this feature, you���ll always see which logins are available when you want to sign in somewhere. To fill one, choose it and unlock 1Password. You don���t need to try to remember whether you���ve already created an account for an app or website. Learn more <a href=\"https://support.1password.com/android-autofill-security/\">about Autofill security</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"use-your-usb-or-nfc-security-key\">Use your USB or NFC security key</h2>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2020/opa74/Yubikey-OPA.gif' alt='Unlock with security key' title='Unlock with security key' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>The best security is done in depth, and you can now protect your 1Password account with an additional layer of security. To get started, <a href=\"https://support.1password.com/two-factor-authentication/\">turn on two-factor authentication</a> for your account on 1Password.com and <a href=\"https://support.1password.com/security-key/\">add your U2F-compatible security key</a>. When you sign in to your account in 1Password on your Android device, you���ll need your security key in addition to your Secret Key and Master Password ��� a little extra peace of mind for you most important data.</p>\n<h2 id=\"and-lots-more\">And lots more���</h2>\n<p>On top of the great features above, there���s lots more to enjoy in this release as well:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use Autofill to update existing Login items in your vaults.</li>\n<li>Quickly sign up for new accounts now that Autofill handles the password confirmation field for you.</li>\n<li>View all items in a 1Password account by selecting the account in the Vault menu.</li>\n<li>Stay informed of the latest new features in each update with our What���s New screen.</li>\n<li>Search your logins when filling on websites using Autofill and accessibility.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And that&rsquo;s just for starters.

The values for X are always changing, but some ideas come up again and again. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be cool if&hellip;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When you log in to a site, 1Password is right there on the page ready to fill?</li>\n<li>You could use 1Password without downloading the app?</li>\n<li>Linux users and Chrome OS users could join in on the fun?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now 1Password can do all these and more. We call it 1Password X, and it&rsquo;s our brand new, full-featured experience that runs entirely in your browser.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s super easy to set up, deploy, and use. It works everywhere Chrome works, including Linux and Chrome OS. And it&rsquo;s a re-imagination of how 1Password works on the web.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2017/b5x1.0/evernote-login.png' alt='1Password X sign in to Evernote' title='1Password X sign in to Evernote' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<h2 id=\"x-is-for-extension\">X is for extension</h2>\n<p>Before we jump in, I want to address one thing you may be thinking: our X is a letter, not a version number. Our X is a hat tip to one of the most beloved features of 1Password, namely our 1Password extension.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2017/b5x1.0/evernote-save.png' alt='Saving Evernote login with 1Password X' title='Saving Evernote login with 1Password X' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>The extension is what allows us to have the little 1Password icon in your browser toolbar. I call it our bread and butter, and I couldn&rsquo;t live without it. ����</p>\n<p>1Password X builds on this experience and takes it to the next level. The most visible change you just saw above ��� your logins are now available directly within the webpage you are viewing!</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s smart, too. 1Password anticipates what you need and shows you the options that are most relevant to your current task. If you are signing up for a new site, 1Password suggests a generated password for you right then and there.</p>\n<p>You can also save your new login, name it, and pick which vault to store it in.</p>\n<h2 id=\"x-is-for-linux\">X is for Linux</h2>\n<p>One of the most popular requests of all time has been Linux support. In fact, the forum thread asking for Linux has over 75,000 views. That&rsquo;s a lot of cold penguins. ����</p>\n<p>Because 1Password X is a Chrome extension, it works everywhere Chrome is available, including Linux. In fact, we initially shared 1Password X exclusively with Linux users as we wanted to make sure we nailed it.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2017/b5x1.0/b5x-locked.jpg' alt='1Password X in locked state' title='1Password X in locked state' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>Tim, our chief sysadmin and &ldquo;beardless keeper of keys and grounds&rdquo; is a hardcore Linux evangelist who, until now, has had no other choice than to use Wine to run 1Password. Tim has been our toughest critic over the years for our lack of Linux support, and so far he&rsquo;s been thrilled.</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s still lots of work to do, but we have thousands of happy Linux users already enjoying 1Password X. And we can&rsquo;t wait to invite all of the other penguins in out of the cold! ����</p>\n<h2 id=\"x-is-for-exceedingly-powerful\">X is for exceedingly powerful</h2>\n<p>1Password X has all of the power of a full-featured app. And because it connects directly to your 1Password account, everything you expect from 1Password is there ��� your vaults, your items, and all their details.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2017/b5x1.0/b5x-features.png' alt='1Password X displaying logins' title='1Password X displaying logins' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>And we&rsquo;ve sprinkled in some additional features to absolutely delight you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Keyboard navigation:</strong> We know this is a big one for power users, so we made sure everything can be done without lifting your fingers from the keyboard.</li>\n<li><strong>Smart search:</strong> Just start typing to find exactly what you need ��� ideal for when you have multiple logins for a site.</li>\n<li><strong>Perfect memory:</strong> 1Password remembers what you were doing last, whether you were in the middle of a search or looking at an item&rsquo;s details.</li>\n<li><strong>One-time password filling:</strong> Your two-factor authentication codes are filled just like usernames and passwords.</li>\n<li><strong>Authentication dialog filling:</strong> If you ever see one those old-school HTTP authentication prompts, rest assured that 1Password can fill them.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>My personal favourite has to be our amazing new search ��� I just start typing and my matching items appear automatically. I love it so much that filling one-time passwords had to take second <del>factor</del> place. It was close, though ��� only 30 seconds behind! ����</p>\n<h2 id=\"x-is-for-extra-easy-setup\">X is for extra easy setup</h2>\n<p>Historically, we&rsquo;ve needed to teach people how to first install and set up the app, and then take them out of the app to install the extension. With 1Password X, they&rsquo;re one and the same. Just install it, enter your Master Password, and you&rsquo;re in.</p>\n<p>Because there&rsquo;s no need to install a separate desktop app, deployment within team environments is as simple as can be. And by using multiple Chrome profiles, your team members can share the same machine while having access to their own 1Password data.</p>\n<p>1Password X can even be installed on Chrome OS, which makes me super excited as now I can finally buy one of those lovely new Pixelbooks. ����</p>\n<h2 id=\"x-is-for-excelsior\">X is for Excelsior!</h2>\n<p>1Password X is a radical new way of using 1Password, but it&rsquo;s not (yet) for everyone. It&rsquo;s still in its early stages so some features are not yet available. For example, it&rsquo;s not yet possible to customize generated passwords or use browsers like Safari, Firefox, and Edge.</p>\n<p>But it is an exciting new way to use 1Password on the web, and for me, that outweighs any drawbacks. I&rsquo;ve been using 1Password X exclusively for the last 6 months, and I couldn&rsquo;t be happier.</p>\n<p>So is 1Password X for you? If you&rsquo;re running Linux or Chrome OS, you should jump right in. Or if you&rsquo;re adventurous and enjoy the thrill of discovering new things while being on the cutting edge, then 1Password X is for you ��� it runs fine alongside the 1Password apps and extension you already use.</p>\n<p>1Password X was designed for our hosted 1Password service and connects directly to your account. It is available in English, French, German, Italian, Russian, and Spanish and can be installed from the Chrome Web Store:</p>\n<p>\n<a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/1password-x/aeblfdkhhhdcdjpifhhbdiojplfjncoa\" class=\"call-to-action \">\nInstall 1Password X\n</a>\n</p>\n<p>I hope you���re as excited about 1Password X as I am!

However you choose to roll out 1Password, it can all be done remotely.</p>\n<h2 id=\"start-small\">Start small</h2>\n<p>It&rsquo;s a good idea to start with a small group of people so you have the flexibility to tweak your setup as you go. Every business is different, but here&rsquo;s some advice everyone can follow to get started:</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2020/business-adoption/pilot_group.png' alt='1Password Usage Report for specified user' title='1Password Usage Report for specified user' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p><strong>Add another owner.</strong> Account owners are the people with ultimate control of 1Password in your business. If an owner runs into access issues, only another owner can help out. So a great first step is adding another owner to make sure you don���t lose access to 1Password. A senior and established member of your organization is usually a good choice. While you&rsquo;re at it, <a href=\"https://support.1password.com/team-recovery-plan/\">implement a recovery plan</a> for your team.</p>\n<p><strong>Add a few administrators.</strong> We recommend inviting administrators before adding team members: a great reason being that administrators can add team members themselves. Administrators will probably do most of the overseeing of 1Password: they can do everything owners can except delete the team, manage owner access, or make changes to your subscription. Senior managers and technical leaders are good candidates.</p>\n<p><strong>And start with a small group.</strong> Start using 1Password with a small group of people so it&rsquo;s easy to course-correct if you need to reorganize the account. You can also hone the deployment process before you roll out 1Password company-wide. It might make sense to start with your IT or security team. And if you have 1Password fans on your team already, it may be a good idea to include them.</p>\n<p>We���ve put together guides for <a href=\"https://support.1password.com/explore/team-admin/\">administrators</a> and <a href=\"https://support.1password.com/explore/team-member/\">team members</a> to help them get started. ����</p>\n<h2 id=\"then-scale\">Then scale</h2>\n<p>Once your first group is up and running with 1Password and you���ve optimized your setup, you���re ready to scale, as fast or slow as you���d like. IBM provisioned 50,000 people in just two weeks ��� so if you want to deploy 1Password quickly, you absolutely can.</p>\n<p><strong>Provision with your identity provider.</strong> If you use an identity provider, the 1Password <a href=\"https://support.1password.com/scim/\">SCIM bridge</a> is the way to go. You can connect 1Password to Azure Active Directory, Okta, or OneLogin to provision and deprovision users automatically, as well as adding and removing them from groups.</p>\n<p><strong>Use a sign-up link.</strong> A sign-up link is another great way to get your team using 1Password quickly. You can share your sign-up link in a group chat, share it in the #announcements channel of your team communication app, or email it to everyone you want to invite.</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://support.1password.com/add-remove-team-members/\">how to add and remove team members</a> for more. �������������</p>\n<h2 id=\"deployment-tips\">Deployment tips</h2>\n<p>Here are some extra tips to help rollout go as smoothly as possible:</p>\n<p><strong>Add data organically.</strong> There���s no need for team members to add all their logins and other information to 1Password right away. It���s often easier when people add and create passwords as they go using the <a href=\"https://support.1password.com/1password-extension/\">1Password browser extension</a>. As well as making it easier to sign in to websites, the extension offers to save your account details as you use them, making it easy to add information to 1Password gradually.</p>\n<p><strong>Create shared vaults as you need them.</strong> Team members should use their private vault to store logins and information only they need access to. Meanwhile, shared vaults are a great way to securely share logins and other important information with the whole team ��� they���re much safer than using email. You can also create additional vaults to keep your information organized, or to share it with specific members of your team.</p>\n<p><strong>Make the most of custom groups</strong> You can create <a href=\"https://support.1password.com/custom-groups/\">custom groups</a> based on projects, geographic locations, departments, functions, and even access levels. Groups make it easy to give specific people access to vaults, and you can even give them team-level permissions, like the ability to recover accounts.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2020/business-adoption/group_together.png' alt='Add Groups' title='Add Groups' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you���re not sure which vaults and custom groups to use, you could look to your company���s organizational structure for inspiration.</p>\n<h2 id=\"were-here-to-help\">We���re here to help</h2>\n<p>Should you need any help or advice along the way, we���re here to help.

Bittersweet because it���s always sad to say goodbye to new friends, but lovely to reflect on the valuable contribution they���ve made to 1Password ��� both our product and our culture.</p>\n<p>This year I wanted to share some thoughts from Mio who interned with us over the spring semester as part of the integrations team, working on the command-line tool. I hope Mio���s story gives you some insight into what it���s like to intern at 1Password ��� and hopefully encourage you to get in touch if it���s something you���d like to do in future. We���re always thrilled to have new students join the team.</p>\n<p>Take it away Mio���</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I got to introduce secure password generation to the command-line interface (CLI). I think it&rsquo;s an awesome feature for a password\nmanager to have, so being able to add that to the CLI myself was honestly pretty exciting.</p>\n<p>Nothing is more motivating than a genuinely exciting project, and I was given the constant opportunity to do just that.\nDespite this only being my second work-term, I feel like I did a lot, and that those things are actually useful internally and to customers.</p>\n<p>At the start, I was a little daunted by the remote aspect of the job. The company spans across the entire world, and my small team alone\ncontained a 9-hour difference in time zones. Communication is naturally key in a remote company, and it felt like there is a mutual\nunderstanding among everyone.</p>\n<p>I was blessed with the opportunity to meet a good bunch of the company at the annual conference, AGConf. With remote work, it&rsquo;s easy for\nthe conversations to really only focus on work, but being able to bond over all the other interesting things in life definitely\nmade the online communication easier and more relaxed.</p>\n<p>I found myself thinking that the remote nature of 1Password is a strength. Because everyone is from all over the world,\nit results in an extremely diverse group of people.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thanks, Mio! I hope this story shows that interning at 1Password is an opportunity to work on real projects. There���s a simple reason for this: it���s best for everyone. I started my 1Password career as an intern working with the iOS team, so I can attest to the invaluable contribution these experiences can make to a career. A few short years later, it���s a privilege to be able to help mentor students during their own internships at 1Password.</p>\n<p>I also hope it shows that we strive to make sure 1Password is a welcoming, nurturing environment. All interns get hands-on, in-depth experience working with the software and the developers behind it. We encourage everyone to dive in and participate, learn as much as they can, and to always ask questions.</p>\n<p>We know that it can be challenging to step into an internship with a remote team, but we pride ourselves on our culture. We make sure that internships are a rewarding and inspiring learning experience, where you forge meaningful connections with team members around the world. (Though we also encourage the Toronto-based interns to come into the office once or twice a week for face-to-face time with the team.)</p>\n<p>If you���re interested in interning at 1Password we���d love to hear from you. We���re always keen to talk to people who are motivated to help us on our mission to make the internet a safer place for everyone. You can keep an eye on our <a href=\"https://1password.com/jobs/\">jobs page</a> and drop us a line when the time is right. We���ll also announce new openings <a href=\"https://twitter.com/1password\">on Twitter</a>.</p>\n<p>Thanks again to Mio, and all our spring semester interns! It was so great to work with you. We wish you all the best for what I���m sure are very bright futures.</p>\n<section class=\"c-call-to-action-box c-call-to-action-box--yellow c-call-to-action-box--background-author c-call-to-action-box--background-author-yellow\">\n<div class=\"c-call-to-action-box__author\">\n<img src=\"https://blog.1password.com/img/authors/connorhicks.jpg\" class=\"c-call-to-action-box__author-image c-call-to-action-box__author-image--yellow\" alt=\"Connor Hicks\"/>\n</div>\n<div class=\"c-call-to-action-box__content\">\n<h3 class=\"c-call-to-action-box__title c-call-to-action-box__title--yellow\">We&#39;re hiring!</h3>\n<div class=\"c-call-to-action-box__text c-call-to-action-box__text--yellow\">\nCheck out our jobs page to find out more about what it&rsquo;s like to work at 1Password, and see our current openings across a range of teams.\n</div>\n<a href=\"https://1password.com/jobs/\" class=\"c-call-to-action-box__link-href c-call-to-action-box__link-href--stacked c-call-to-action-box__link-href--yellow\" data-on=\"click\" data-event-category=\"CTA\" data-event-action=\"call-to-action-button\">\nSee open positions\n</a>\n</div>\n</section>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 17 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":10468,"bgimg":"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2020/dev-internship/header.png","linkMd5":"623e58a374a9fa2151fcd9d3d14420e6","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn42@2020_4/2020/08/25/00-54-51-847_728a501fb0f57883.webp","destWidth":2080,"destHeight":800,"sourceBytes":33641,"destBytes":42530,"author":"Connor Hicks","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2020/dev-internship/header.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn42@2020_4/2020/08/25/00-54-51-847_728a501fb0f57883.webp","https://blog.1password.com/img/authors/connorhicks.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn58@2020_5/2020/08/25/00-54-59-114_5ea100e3cebae8a1.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598316891413},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:54:51","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:54:51","title":"Why I switched to 1Password X","link":"https://blog.1password.com/why-i-switched-to-1password-x/","description":"\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/1passwordx-user-experience/header.png' class='webfeedsFeaturedVisual' alt='Why I switched to 1Password X' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p class=\"introduction\">I���ve used 1Password far longer than I���ve worked here, but until I came on board I only used the Mac and mobile apps. Although I knew that there was a browser-based option, I didn&rsquo;t give it much thought until I was poking around during my new-hire training.</p>\n<p>Honestly, what took me so long? Within a few weeks of discovering that 1Password X existed, it became the primary way I use 1Password on my computer.</p>\n<p>1Password X is a full-featured version of 1Password that runs entirely within a browser. It runs on my Linux machine just as smoothly as it does my Mac. And because 1Password X connects to your 1Password account, you have access to everything you expect. That���s extremely helpful if you���re anything like a lot of us here and find yourself jumping between different computers and platforms multiple times a day.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/1passwordx-user-experience/popover.png' alt='1Password works in your browser' title='1Password works in your browser' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<h2 id=\"how-does-it-work\">How does it work?</h2>\n<p>Although I first discovered 1Password X on Linux, it quickly became my preferred way of using 1Password on Mac as well. I love having all my passwords stored in 1Password, and 1Password X streamlines and simplifies my workflow.</p>\n<p>1Password X works in the background of my browser, anticipates exactly what I need, and shows the relevant options in-line ��� right where I need them. If I navigate to a page with a saved login, I simply click the 1Password icon and select an option to fill. It will even detect if I have more than one login for a site, like Gmail or Twitter, and all I have to do is start typing my username to find the one I want.</p>\n<p>It makes signing up for a new website easier too. It suggests and saves a newly generated password right on the account creation page!</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/1passwordx-user-experience/suggested-password.png' alt='Suggesting a new password' title='Suggesting a new password' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>With 1Password working seamlessly in Chrome, it���s become such a natural part of my daily routine that I almost don���t even notice it working away.</p>\n<h2 id=\"even-more-fun\">Even more fun</h2>\n<p>I already love 1Password X, perhaps more than is socially acceptable, but the release of the <a href=\"https://blog.1password.com/1password-x-may-2019-update/\">May 2019 update</a> made it even better. I&rsquo;m a big fan of two-factor authentication and have it enabled for every service that offers it. The latest update of 1Password X fills one-time passwords automatically ��� in addition to usernames and passwords ��� even when the login process is split across multiple pages.</p>\n<p>I can���t wait to see what else they���re cooking up and how those improvements will make my digital life even easier.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1password-x-works-in-your-browser\">1Password X works in your browser</h2>\n<p>1Password X takes the experience I expect from the Mac and iOS apps I had been using and makes them even better. It&rsquo;s available on Linux, Chrome OS, Mac, and Windows. And it���s easy to set up and use in your favorite browser: Chrome, Firefox, Opera, or Brave.</p>\n<p>It���s a re-imagination of how 1Password works on the web, designed to make your life easier. And, just like all the 1Password apps, the <a href=\"https://support.1password.com/1password-x-security/\">security of 1Password X</a> keeps your most important information safe and confidential.</p>\n<p>1Password X is awesome and incredibly useful, but that doesn&rsquo;t stop me from using 1Password.com or 1Password for Mac when I want to.

While that���s great for innovation, there���s a downside: the accounts employees create without a business���s authorization or awareness, known as shadow IT.</p>\n<p>At first glance, shadow IT might appear harmless. The problem is, without the oversight and direction of IT, it���s easy for employees to unwittingly create vulnerabilities in even the tightest of security setups.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-prevalent-is-shadow-it\">How prevalent is shadow IT?</h2>\n<p>There���s plenty of anecdotal evidence of how disruptive shadow IT accounts can be, but we wanted data.</p>\n<p>So, we surveyed a representative sample of 2,119 US adults who work in an office with an IT department and use a computer for work (see end of post for methodology), and found that a staggering 63.5% (�� 1.03) of respondents have created at least one account in the past 12 months that their IT department doesn���t know about:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Yes 63.5% (�� 1.03)</li>\n<li>No 36.5% (�� 1.03)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Of those that answered yes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>32.4% (�� 0.67) had created one account that their IT department doesn���t know about</li>\n<li>51.8% (�� 0.67) had created between two and five accounts that their IT department doesn���t know about</li>\n<li>15.8% (�� 0.67) had created more than five accounts that their IT department doesn���t know about</li>\n</ul>\n<p>��\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2020/shadow-it/creatiing-shadow-it.png' alt='Graph illustrating the creation of shadow IT accounts' title='Graph illustrating the creation of shadow IT accounts' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n</p>\n<p>What���s more troubling is that 33.2% (�� 1.03) of people who have created shadow IT accounts reuse memorable passwords, and 48.2% (�� 1.03) use a pattern of similar passwords. Only 2.6% (�� 1.03) said that they use a unique password every time.</p>\n<p>��\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2020/shadow-it/choosing-password.png' alt='Graph illustrating password habits' title='Graph illustrating password habits' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n</p>\n<p>��</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-dangers-of-shadow-it\">The dangers of shadow IT</h2>\n<p>So, why is this a problem? Carlos in marketing opens an Airtable account, and Anita in legal uses Grammarly to check for grammatical errors. Often, these services are free to use and make it easier for employees to do their jobs. Ultimately that���s a good thing, right?</p>\n<p>But when employees use services without the authorization of the IT team, it brings risks. Say Carlos populates Airtable with customer data for his email campaigns, and Anita checks sensitive legal documents in Grammarly. Without thinking about it, they���re sharing a lot of important data with external companies that IT doesn���t even know about.</p>\n<p>If one of these services suffers a breach, the company won���t know it affects them, which leaves them powerless to secure their data after the event. It also means they���ll be unable to disclose it to their customers. This could leave any company facing costly fines and a huge loss of trust in its operations.</p>\n<p>And, when over <a href=\"https://enterprise.verizon.com/resources/reports/dbir/\">80% of data and privacy breaches are due to poor password practices</a>, the risk multiplies when employees use weak, reused, or memorable passwords for the services they���ve signed up to. If those login details are compromised, attackers could use that information to access other accounts, which may also hold sensitive data.</p>\n<h2 id=\"who-has-access\">Who has access?</h2>\n<p>Shadow IT can also cause problems when an employee quits or is fired: 20.5% (��0.40) of those surveyed reported getting locked out of a work account because a colleague left the company.</p>\n<p>But who loses access isn���t the only concern: if an employee leaves, they���ll retain access to the accounts they���ve created outside of IT���s purview. At worst, this company data could be shared with a competitor; at best, it���s left dormant and hidden, but it still puts the company at risk if the service is breached.</p>\n<p>Our research also found that 37.0% (�� 2.04) of respondents had shared an account with a colleague. The most popular methods of password sharing were worryingly insecure: with email (39.7% (�� 1.46)) and instant messenger (16.9% (�� 1.46)) coming out on top. Here���s the full breakdown:</p>\n<p>Have you ever shared an account or website login with a colleague?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Yes 37.0% (�� 2.04)</li>\n<li>No 63.0% (�� 2.04)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Those who answered yes used the following methods to share passwords:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>39.7% (�� 1.46 ) email</li>\n<li>16.9% (�� 1.46 ) instant messenger</li>\n<li>13.7% (�� 1.46 ) password manager</li>\n<li>11.4% (�� 1.46 ) spreadsheet or similar</li>\n<li>9.2% (�� 1.46 ) verbally</li>\n<li>4.9% (�� 1.46 ) written on paper</li>\n<li>4.3% (�� 1.46 ) other</li>\n</ul>\n<p>��\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2020/shadow-it/password-sharing.png' alt='Graph illustrating how colleagues share passwords' title='Graph illustrating how colleagues share passwords' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n</p>\n<p>Even more concerning are the password habits of those using insecure digital methods (for example, instant messenger, email, spreadsheet) to share these passwords: 51.1% (�� 0.99) use a pattern of memorable passwords, and 37.8% (�� 0.99) will reuse passwords.</p>\n<p>That means 88.9% (�� 0.99) of people who share passwords through insecure digital methods either use password patterns or reuse passwords. It���s a huge risk to share passwords insecurely online, and it���s even riskier when those passwords could be used to access other accounts.</p>\n<h2 id=\"understanding-unseen-passwords\">Understanding unseen passwords</h2>\n<p>The problem is two-fold: the symptom of shadow IT is unseen passwords. Your business may have a system in place for securing the credentials for the accounts they���ve approved, but what about when people start using services outside that list?</p>\n<p>These login details may be stored on employees��� phones, in cloud-hosted spreadsheets, or plain-text documents, creating untraceable holes in a business���s security. That���s on top of the risks we���ve already detailed above.</p>\n<p>But banning shadow IT altogether has its drawbacks. It slows employee productivity as every new service or app will need approval from the IT department, creating a bottleneck and more work for everyone. It also halts innovation and creates resistance to finding new and better ways of working. Businesses need to find a way to bring it all back under their control without hindering their employees��� ability to excel in their roles.</p>\n<h2 id=\"security-facilitates-innovation\">Security facilitates innovation</h2>\n<p>To overcome this and encourage productivity and process improvements, businesses must create a safer environment in which shadow IT can exist, rather than banning it outright.</p>\n<p>Businesses that use a <a href=\"https://1password.com/password-manager/\">password manager</a> like 1Password are better positioned to secure any account, whether they know about it or not: employees can generate strong, unique passwords and save them in a secure and shareable way. This addresses the inclination to reuse passwords or share them using insecure methods.</p>\n<p>We���re growing our teams responsible for customer education because we know that when it comes to security, it needs to feel easy and convenient. When it does, over time, employees��� confidence grows and security habits change for the better.</p>\n<p>These practices need to continue at home, too, which is why we offer a free <a href=\"https://1password.com/families/\">1Password Families</a> membership to everyone who uses <a href=\"https://1password.com/business/\">1Password Business</a>. When security is seamlessly integrated into employees��� professional and personal lives, it makes them inherently more aware of the risks associated with opening new accounts and the importance of securing their credentials.</p>\n<p>After those good security habits are in place, even accounts outside the view of the IT team will be protected with a strong and unique password. And if these credentials are stored securely, they���ll remain in your hands, even after an employee leaves.</p>\n<p>By catching and protecting the accounts IT doesn���t know about, 1Password is uniquely situated to solve the issue of shadow IT and unseen passwords ��� without slowing productivity, stifling innovation, or creating bottlenecks.</p>\n<h2 id=\"methodology\">Methodology</h2>\n<p>These results are based on the December 2019 polling of a representative sample of 2,119 American adults (18+) via SurveyMonkey&rsquo;s Audience platform.

We���ve long anticipated this day here at AgileBits. After months of hard work, <a href=\"https://1password.com/downloads/ios/\">1Password 7 for iOS</a> is now available on iOS 11.</p>\n<p>The very first step in the journey that brought us to this point was taken back in June, shortly after the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference. Before a single line of code was written, before a single new screen was designed, we set a single goal for this update: <strong>efficiency</strong>. Along the way, we also added a few more features, like support for iPhone X and Face ID, and we���re excited to finally share it all with you.</p>\n<p>As our release notes say, this is the greatest version of 1Password for iOS we have ever shipped, so let���s dive in, shall we?</p>\n<h2 id=\"iphone-x-and-face-id\">iPhone X and Face ID</h2>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/efficiency-abounds/face-id.png' alt='iPhone X and Face ID' title='iPhone X and Face ID' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>On September 12th, like many of you, everyone here at AgileBits was glued to their screens watching Apple���s keynote from the beautiful Steve Jobs Theater at the new Apple Park campus. The announcement of iPhone X was already exciting, but the introduction of Face ID was like Christmas for us. We knew right away that we���d move heaven and earth to be there on launch day with Face ID support.</p>\n<p>We began working immediately to make sure that 1Password worked perfectly on iPhone X. Apple was smart and made Face ID work wherever Touch ID already does, so technically we didn���t need to do anything. But that���s not the way we roll.</p>\n<p>We completely <strong>optimized the lock screen for Face ID</strong>. Matt Davey, who led the design effort, blew the doors off with this one. ����</p>\n<p>My iPhone X is set to arrive tomorrow, and I can���t wait to install 1Password and step into the future.</p>\n<h2 id=\"quick-copy\">Quick Copy</h2>\n<p>In a perfect world, every developer would <a href=\"https://blog.agilebits.com/1password-apps/\">be as awesome as these folks</a> and take five minutes to <a href=\"https://github.com/agilebits/onepassword-app-extension\">add support for 1Password</a> to their app. But because we don���t live in a perfect world, signing in to another app sometimes used to mean you needed to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Open 1Password.</li>\n<li>Find the Login you need.</li>\n<li>Copy your username.</li>\n<li>Switch back to the app where you need it.</li>\n<li>Paste your username.</li>\n<li>Switch back to 1Password.</li>\n<li>Copy your password.</li>\n<li>Switch back to the app where you need it.</li>\n<li>Paste the password.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>And if you needed the <a href=\"https://support.1password.com/one-time-passwords/\">one-time password</a> for that app, there were four more steps after that. Yeesh!</p>\n<p>In 1Password 7, copying is now done automatically. After you copy your username and paste it in another app, switching back to 1Password will <strong>automatically copy your password</strong>. And it���s the same with one-time passwords. Switch back one more time, and they���re copied automatically, too.</p>\n<p>You can learn more about <a href=\"https://support.1password.com/copy-passwords/?ios#use-quick-copy\">Quick Copy</a> on our lovely support site.</p>\n<h2 id=\"favorites\">Favorites</h2>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/efficiency-abounds/1Password-7-Favorites.gif' alt='Favorites' title='Favorites' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>There���s no faster way to access an item than by adding it as a favorite. At least, that���s what we used to think. In 1Password 7, I���m happy to say that we���ve done better. Way better.</p>\n<p>Now, when you tap an item in Favorites, you���ll see all the details you want to copy in a beautiful array of bubbles. Simply tap on any one of the bubbles to copy its value to the clipboard. Not only that, but items on the Favorites list participate in Quick Copy as well!</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-key-to-a-great-app\">The Key to a Great App</h2>\n<p>iOS has wonderful support for external keyboards, and I���m happy to report that now 1Password does, too. If you���re one of our keyboard warriors, make sure you give it a try. 1Password 7 includes <a href=\"https://support.1password.com/keyboard-shortcuts/?ios\">keyboard shortcuts</a> for searching, switching tabs, opening and filling items, and more.</p>\n<h2 id=\"go-speed-racer\">Go Speed Racer</h2>\n<p>Big, new features are awesome, but we didn���t stop there. We dug deep to unearth some truly fantastic perfomance increases for this update as well. 1Password now unlocks 33% faster and has seen a 400% increase in stability throughout. We also made some improvements to our password generator to make it much more responsive and easier to use.</p>\n<h2 id=\"wrapping-it-up-in-a-pretty-package\">Wrapping It Up In a Pretty Package</h2>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/efficiency-abounds/New-App-Icon-Reveal.png' alt='Wrapping It Up In a Pretty Package' title='Wrapping It Up In a Pretty Package' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>No major update would be complete without a fresh coat of paint on the user interface. 1Password 7 sports a beautiful new icon with a gorgeous gradient on the lock ring. That color scheme carries through to the lock screen where, if you let it sit for a few seconds, you���ll notice a gentle ���happiness vortex��� animation take place as the colors go for a spin.</p>\n<p>Many of you use the 1Password extension to sign in to websites directly in Safari or other third-party apps. The next time you do, you���ll see the extension received a fantastic visual update as well!</p>\n<p>We���ve also overhauled the navigation bar at the bottom of the screen with some new iconography and a better layout. Coupled with the aforementioned new look for Favorites, our beloved <a href=\"https://1password.com/downloads/ios/\">iOS app</a> has never looked better.</p>\n<h2 id=\"and-the-hits-keep-coming\">And the Hits Keep Coming</h2>\n<p>Check out the <a href=\"https://app-updates.agilebits.com/product_history/OPI4\">1Password for iOS release notes</a> for a full account of everything we���ve crammed into 1Password 7, but I wanted to close out with a few more of my top picks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you register a new fingerprint with Touch ID, 1Password will require your Master Password the next time you open it.</li>\n<li>You can now delete multiple items at once.

src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/mac-catalina-release/header.png' class='webfeedsFeaturedVisual' alt='Security is a key focus in macOS Catalina' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p class=\"introduction\">macOS Catalina launched earlier this month, and it���s <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/macos/catalina/features/\">chock full of fantastic new features</a>. We���re thrilled to see the emphasis Apple has placed on user privacy and security in this latest release. I installed it on launch day and have been exploring the ins and outs ever since. Here���s what I was most excited to see ��� and what the 1Password team thinks you���ll love too.</p>\n<h2 id=\"lock-it-up-tight\">Lock it up tight</h2>\n<p>Losing my laptop is one of my worst nightmares ��� all my photos, music, and writing gone in a flash. Sure, I keep backups of everything, but I don���t want anyone else getting their hands on my important information. Or my high school photos that prove I had no sense of style. That���s why the new Activation Lock feature is so incredible.</p>\n<p>With the new security feature in place, no one can access your account even if they physically have your computer. So, if your laptop is stolen from a coffee shop, the only person who can erase and reactivate it is you. It gives you peace of mind and adds an additional layer of security to your data. Even if someone got their hands on your laptop, they���d still be completely locked out of everything.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exploring-safari\">Exploring Safari</h2>\n<p>I���ve always flip-flopped between browsers. But, no matter what, I���ve always gone back to Safari. It���s like an old reliable friend. And with new intuitive features like directing me to the right tab when I start typing an address of a website I already have open, I may never look back.</p>\n<p>There���s a lot to love in the latest version of Apple���s web browser. The new start page makes it easy to jump right to my bookmarks and frequently visited websites. It even pulls in and displays links from iMessage, so I don���t have to scroll through weeks of messages just to find the chocolate bourbon cake recipe my sister shared with me.</p>\n<h2 id=\"protection-for-macos\">Protection for macOS</h2>\n<p>To keep your Mac running smoothly, Catalina also introduces a new dedicated, read-only system volume to keep your operating system files safe and sound. It���s completely separate from all your other data, which means it can���t be accidentally overwritten.</p>\n<p>Apple has also made it easier to use and develop hardware peripherals and sophisticated features without compromising on security. With DriverKit and user space system extensions, code for these programs runs separately from the operating system, just like any other app, so they won���t affect macOS if something goes wrong.</p>\n<p>All of this means extra layers of protection for your critical operating system files ��� improving reliability and reducing the risk of unwelcome system failures.</p>\n<h2 id=\"enhanced-gatekeeper\">Enhanced Gatekeeper</h2>\n<p>Even with the plethora of apps available from the <a href=\"https://blog.1password.com/a-journey-into-the-new-mac-app-store/\">Mac App Store</a>, there are still some that need to be downloaded directly from the developer&rsquo;s site. And if you���re anything like me, you may sometimes forget to verify how safe and secure it is.</p>\n<p>Enhanced Gatekeeper checks every new app you install for any security issues before you run it for the first time. It will also periodically check that the app remains safe to use, for as long as it���s installed on your machine.</p>\n<p>It was no small feat for our developers to get 1Password working seamlessly with Apple���s new operating system, but I���m so glad they did. With all of the <a href=\"https://blog.1password.com/never-better-time-to-upgrade-to-1password-7/\">impressive upgrades to 1Password 7</a> and the new exciting features of macOS Catalina, this combination is now my favorite way to browse the web safely.</p>\n<p>1Password 7 is <a href=\"https://support.1password.com/upgrade-mac/\">included with every 1Password membership</a>, and has everything you need to organize and secure your digital life.

We’ve added some new features that make it easier to stay organized and share the essentials with your family and coworkers.</p> \n<p>There���s a lot to love about 1Password 7.5, so let���s dive right in.</p> \n<h2 id=\"stay-organized-with-tags\">Stay organized with tags</h2> \n<p> <img src=\"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2020/opi75/create-tag-light.png\" alt=\"Create new tag\" title=\"Create new tag\" style=\"max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;\" /> <img src=\"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2020/opi75/create-tag-dark.png\" alt=\"Create new tag\" title=\"Create new tag\" style=\"max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;\" /> </p> \n<p><a href=\"https://support.1password.com/favorites-tags/\">Tags and favorites</a> make it a breeze to keep everything organized in 1Password. You can use multiple tags on a single item, and there’s no limit to the number of tags you can create. This release rolls out a new tag editor that allows you to effortlessly apply new and existing tags to your items.</p> \n<p>Tags can now be added to an item without needing to edit first. While viewing an item, tap on the “Add Tag” button to unveil the all-new tag editor and make your changes.</p> \n<h2 id=\"share-your-items\">Share your items</h2> \n<p>We’ve made it easier than ever to <a href=\"https://support.1password.com/family-sharing/\">securely share</a> passwords, documents, and other items with your family and coworkers. Now when you put an item in a shared vault you can send a link directly to the item in 1Password, saving everyone time searching for what they need.

I’ve been testing our new sorting feature in beta for a few weeks, and it’s exactly what I’ve always wanted. Now when I dive into a list of items it’s always sorted just how I would expect.</p> \n<p>Here are the all-new sorting options available in 1Password for iOS:</p> \n<p><strong>Category.</strong> Easily find and manage your logins for social media, shopping sites, and more.</p> \n<p><strong>Website.</strong> Quickly scan for and find duplicate Login items.</p> \n<p><strong>Date modified.</strong> Find items that haven’t been updated in a while to verify the information is still valid.</p> \n<p><strong>Date created.</strong> View items you���ve created recently to finish organizing them by adding tags or sorting into vaults.</p> \n<p><strong>Date item was last used.</strong> Locate and edit or remove items you haven’t used in years.</p> \n<h2 id=\"ready-now\">Ready now</h2> \n<p>Along with the new features we’ve outlined here, this release includes improvements and bug fixes to keep everything running smoothly.</p> \n<p>1Password 7.5 is available now and we hope you enjoy the update.

From the new Macs, to the new iPads, to 1Password making an awesome cameo on stage it had everything I could want in an Apple keynote.</p>\n<p>Full disclosure before we go any further in today���s post, folks: I am tapping into a deep vein of long-running Apple fanboyism. If you���d rather not hear me gush about all the stuff that was announced at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, here���s the gist: 1Password on stage, woo! Brand new iPad Pros with Face ID, incredible! New MacBook Airs (with Touch ID) and Mac minis, fantastic!</p>\n<p>Speaking of that cameo, we were super surprised and honored to show up on the screen behind Laura. Touch ID on the Mac is one of my favorite features and having Apple use 1Password to show it off to the world was just terrific. ����</p>\n<p>���\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/brooklyn-reaction/image_0.png' alt='1Password appearing on stage at the event' title='1Password appearing on stage at the event' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n</p>\n<h2 id=\"brand-new-macs\">Brand New Macs</h2>\n<p>Now I don���t care to engage in hyperbole, and the word ���finally��� is usually uttered in a wry tone, but seeing new a whole new model of Mac mini <em>finally</em> announced today was so great. We love these little Macs here at 1Password, especially on the development team where they make great build and test servers. You can bet we���ll be adding one or two of these to our arsenal to supplement the iMac we currently use to distribute 1Password for Mac and iOS.</p>\n<p>It was also great to see the all new MacBook Air with Touch ID and Retina display! While I���ve never actually owned an Air, any time I���ve used a friend���s I���ve always been blown away by how thin they are. Seeing Touch ID show up in another Mac in Apple���s lineup is super cool, too. It makes using 1Password such a breeze and anything that makes it easier for folks to sign in to their online accounts without typing a password gets a ���� from me.</p>\n<h2 id=\"all-new-ipad-pros\">All New iPad Pros</h2>\n<p>I am a huge fan of the iPad Pro. My current second generation iPad Pro 12.9��� (which I call Big Bertha) is one of my favorite Apple devices I���ve ever owned. The giant screen and speedy processor work so well for photo editing that I���ve completely replaced my MacBook Pro as my photography production rig. Today���s announcement of the all new iPad Pro takes what was already a fantastic device and raises it to a whole new level. Face ID is a natural progression for this product. We���ll know more very soon, but if I had to imagine it I���m guessing this is what 1Password���s lock screen will soon look like on iPad:\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/brooklyn-reaction/image_1.png' alt='Mockup of 1Password lock screen' title='Mockup of 1Password lock screen' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n</p>\n<h2 id=\"wrapping-it-up\">Wrapping it Up</h2>\n<p>I warned you at the beginning that there was going to be a bit of gushing today. We love Apple here at 1Password and it���s always inspiring to watch them unveil great new products. Seeing how they push the envelope of what is possible with hardware makes us want to create even greater software. How about you, what was your favorite part of today���s event? Have you ordered any shiny new hardware? I warmed up my credit card this afternoon with a new 12.9&rdquo; iPad Pro + Smart Keyboard Folio. Next Wednesday cannot come soon enough.</p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 30 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":10468,"bgimg":"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/brooklyn-reaction/header.png","linkMd5":"074b60b79e82f677139211c2f5c0b764","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn25@2020_3/2020/08/25/00-54-51-859_0a5ea908773949ec.webp","destWidth":2080,"destHeight":800,"sourceBytes":110873,"destBytes":47362,"author":"Michael Fey","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/brooklyn-reaction/header.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn25@2020_3/2020/08/25/00-54-51-859_0a5ea908773949ec.webp","https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/brooklyn-reaction/image_0.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn80@2020_2/2020/08/25/00-54-58-152_9b4ba306443aeeeb.webp","https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/brooklyn-reaction/image_1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn13@2020_1/2020/08/25/00-54-59-100_1a68054e9f999149.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598316891417},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:54:51","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:54:51","title":"1Password 7 for Windows: The Best Ever","link":"https://blog.1password.com/1password-7-for-windows-the-best-ever/","description":"\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/opw7.0/header.png' class='webfeedsFeaturedVisual' alt='1Password 7 for Windows: The Best Ever' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p class=\"introduction\">Hot on the heels of <a href=\"https://blog.agilebits.com/2018/05/22/1password-7-for-mac-the-best-ever/\">last week&rsquo;s 1Password 7 for Mac announcement</a>, I&rsquo;m pleased as punch to unveil the best version of 1Password for Windows ever: <strong>1Password 7 for Windows is here!</strong> ���� ����</p>\n<p>This is a massive release where quite literally everything has changed. Seriously, every bit and every pixel has been recreated from scratch using the latest and greatest technologies to make 1Password the best it can be.</p>\n<p>From an incredible new design to having all your vaults in one place to a whole new architecture, 1Password 7 is the fastest, prettiest, and most powerful version of 1Password yet. In short, it&rsquo;s simply the best. A bold claim but thankfully we can back it up. ����</p>\n<h2 id=\"all-new-modern-design\">All new modern design</h2>\n<p>Our design team has been working their tails off reimagining every aspect of 1Password. We wanted to make it as powerful and beautiful as the Mac app while staying true to the Windows platform.</p>\n<p>It all added up to a breathtaking new design that you&rsquo;re going to love. And it all starts with the lock screen.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/opw7.0/opw7-locked-surface.png' alt='1Password 7 for Windows lock screen asking for your Master Password with a Windows Hello button' title='1Password 7 for Windows lock screen asking for your Master Password with a Windows Hello button' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>The steel doors look great and also symbolize the strong encryption that protects your data. And to would-be-attackers, our encryption design is far more secure than the strongest steel.</p>\n<p>Once you unlock 1Password with your Master Password (or Windows Hello), you&rsquo;ll be delighted by the stunning new layout protected behind those doors.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/opw7.0/opw7-unlocked.png' alt='1Password 7 for Windows main window with new sidebar and item layout' title='1Password 7 for Windows main window with new sidebar and item layout' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>Beautiful! ����</p>\n<p>Everything has changed and not a single element of the design has been left untouched. Yet the heart and soul of 1Password remain, so you���re able to jump right in and find everything you need.</p>\n<p>Your items have never looked better and with full support for time-based one-time passwords, logins really shine. They look so good that you&rsquo;ll find yourself happily waiting for a new 2FA code simply so you can watch the countdown animation. ����</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/opw7.0/opw7-totp.png' alt='Login details for GitHub with 2FA code showing' title='Login details for GitHub with 2FA code showing' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>You can also zoom right in on the password using Large Type. This is perfect for those times you need to type it on another device or are asked for specific characters from your password.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/opw7.0/opw7-large-type.png' alt='Password shown in Large Type window' title='Password shown in Large Type window' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>Our new highlight feature while searching makes finding what you&rsquo;re looking for super easy. And with the addition of search power-ups like <code>title:</code>, <code>tag:</code>, and <code>file:</code>, it&rsquo;s never been easier to discover what you&rsquo;re looking for.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/opw7.0/opw7-search-highlights.png' alt='1Password main window during search with highlights' title='1Password main window during search with highlights' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>And when you prefer to browse, the sidebar is great for navigating between your categories and tags. Along with support for nested tags you can take things to a whole new level by organizing your organization. ����</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/opw7.0/opw7-nested-tags.png' alt='1Password sidebar with nested tags' title='1Password sidebar with nested tags' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>Oh and the sidebar gets even better as your vaults live there, too.</p>\n<h2 id=\"all-your-vaults-all-in-one-place\">All your vaults, all in one place</h2>\n<p>There&rsquo;s more to the sidebar than meets the eye. Sitting just beneath the surface is a powerful new way to organize and securely share your items.</p>\n<p>Simply click on the sidebar header and your categories will slide away, revealing your collection of vaults. Vaults allow you to group your items depending on their purpose and who needs access to them.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/opw7.0/opw7-sidebar-vaults.png' alt='1Password sidebar shows vaults and accounts' title='1Password sidebar shows vaults and accounts' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>Vaults are so nice that you���ll find yourself adding lots of them. Between my AgileBits business and Teare family accounts, I now have over 50 vaults. Being able to switch between vaults and accounts makes it super simple to stay focused on the task at hand.</p>\n<p>Together with a <a href=\"https://1password.com/families\">1Password Families</a> or <a href=\"https://1password.com/business\">1Password Business</a> account, vaults can be used to securely share passwords with your family and colleagues. Simply sign in to 1Password.com and choose who you want to share with and 1Password will do the rest.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/opw7.0/opw7-manage-vault-access.png' alt='Manage vault window showing who has access to our Directors vaults' title='Manage vault window showing who has access to our Directors vaults' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>My favourite part of sharing passwords this way is the ability to control everyone&rsquo;s permissions, including making passwords read-only. For those with edit access, changes they make will be seen by everyone else right away.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1password-mini-is-always-by-your-side\">1Password mini is always by your side</h2>\n<p>The new awesome carries over into 1Password mini as well, yielding a more powerful and beautiful experience. When you&rsquo;re on a website and need to login, 1Password mini makes it super easy.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/opw7.0/opw7-mini-login-evernote.png' alt='Google Chrome on Evernote.com sign in screen with 1Password mini showing each saved Evernote login' title='Google Chrome on Evernote.com sign in screen with 1Password mini showing each saved Evernote login' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>Selecting a login will automatically fill your username and password for you. And if you have two-factor enabled, the one-time password will be automatically copied to your clipboard so you have everything you need right at your Ctrl-V fingertips.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/opw7.0/opw7-mini-totp-evernote.png' alt='Evernote sign in page asking for the second factor authentication code; filled using the code placed in the clipboard after filling from 1Password mini' title='Evernote sign in page asking for the second factor authentication code; filled using the code placed in the clipboard after filling from 1Password mini' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>1Password mini will also help you create new logins as well. When you sign up for a new service or log in for the first time, 1Password mini will jump in and offer to save it for you.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/opw7.0/opw7-mini-save-login.png' alt='1Password mini prompting to save a login on Evernote.com' title='1Password mini prompting to save a login on Evernote.com' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>In addition to naming your new login and assigning tags, you can also choose which vault to save it to. This is great for keeping things organized as well as choosing who to share with.</p>\n<p>And if a website has been breached, mini will alert you so you know that you need to update the password.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/opw7.0/opw7-mini-watchtower.jpeg' alt='1Password mini showing matching logins for Yahoo; one login has been identified by Watchtower as needing its password changed' title='1Password mini showing matching logins for Yahoo; one login has been identified by Watchtower as needing its password changed' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>Oh and then there&rsquo;s also Open and Fill which automatically opens websites and fills passwords for you. When combined with the search and organization features of 1Password mini, it&rsquo;s perfect for bookmarking your favourite sites.</p>\n<h2 id=\"designed-for-everybody\">Designed for everybody</h2>\n<p>We wanted to create 1Password 7 for everybody and be as inclusive as possible. That started with allowing you to sync your vaults yourself as well as using 1Password accounts on <a href=\"https://1password.com\">1Password.com</a>, <a href=\"https://1password.ca\">1Password.ca</a>, and <a href=\"https://1password.eu\">1Password.eu</a>.</p>\n<p>1Password also speaks your language and has been localized to Fran��ais, Deutsch, Italiano, ���������, ���������, Portugu��s, Py����������, ������������, ������������, and Espa��ol.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/opw7.0/opw7-japanese.png' alt='1Password main window in Japanese with the settings window open' title='1Password main window in Japanese with the settings window open' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>Being able to use 1Password in your language is great and it���s even better on High-DPI displays. 1Password 7 has full support for HiDPI in Windows 10 so it looks incredible on 4K monitors and other high density screens.</p>\n<p>And for those of you who rely on assistive technologies, rest assured that 1Password 7 is fully accessible with out-of-the-box support for screen readers like <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-ca/help/17173/windows-10-hear-text-read-aloud\">Narrator</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-hello-there-windows-hello\">Why hello there, Windows Hello</h2>\n<p>We also added support for Windows Hello so you can unlock 1Password using your fingerprint or simply your smile. This works great in the main app as well as in mini.</p>\n<p>\n<video class=\"round shadow\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; padding: 0;\"autoplay='true'muted='true'loop=\"loop\" playsinline=\"\" width=\"100%\" alt='1Password main window in Japanese with the settings window open' controls>\n<source src=\"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/opw7.0/opw7-windows-hello.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" />\n</video>\n</p>\n<p>I love the &ldquo;looking for you&rdquo; animation with the eye looking back and forth, and can&rsquo;t help but grin when I&rsquo;m greeted with a smiling face along with the &ldquo;Hello, dave!&rdquo; message. ����</p>\n<p>As for security, your data is protected by your Master Password as always. To keep things as secure as possible, the first time you unlock you will need to provide your Master Password and then Windows Hello will be able to unlock 1Password thereafter.</p>\n<h2 id=\"strong-foundations\">Strong foundations</h2>\n<p>1Password 7 is a completely new modern app built from the ground up to use the latest and greatest technologies available. This gave us a strong foundation and allowed us to push the envelope to make 1Password the best it could be.</p>\n<p>In addition to fundamental enhancements like HiDPI and Unicode support, 1Password 7 comes with a whole new database layer that enabled us to make everything much, <em>much</em>, <strong>much</strong> faster.</p>\n<p>And if you&rsquo;re moving over to our new 1Password memberships, syncing your data is <a href=\"https://1password.com/security/\">more secure</a> than ever. With the addition of a Secret Key, Secure Remote Password, and Galois/Counter Mode, your data has never been safer. Oh, and to top things off, the speed and reliability is simply unparalleled.</p>\n<p>All of these changes combine into the fastest, most secure, and best looking 1Password experience on Windows ever! Long story short: you&rsquo;re in for an amazing treat! ����</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-do-i-get-it\">How do I get it?</h2>\n<p>To start enjoying the best version of 1Password ever built, grab it here:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://app-updates.agilebits.com/download/OPW7\">Download 1Password 7</a></p>\n<p>1Password 7 is included free for everyone with a 1Password membership. Simply unlock 1Password after downloading and you���re good to go.</p>\n<p>Those of you with a standalone license will be prompted to subscribe or purchase a license when 1Password 7 first opens. Licenses will cost $64.99 but are available during our launch special for only $49.99. Licenses are per-person, per-platform so you can use your single license on as many PCs as you have. 1Password 7 for Mac is a separate purchase.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy 1Password 7 as much as we enjoyed making it for you. We couldn���t have done it without your help. ���</p>\n<p>Please join us in our discussion forums or in the comments below to share your experiences with us and help craft the future of 1Password. We always love hearing from you. ����</p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 29 May 2018 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":10468,"bgimg":"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/opw7.0/header.png","linkMd5":"1d2a509e5c1e059b8f236f26b7984a56","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn26@2020_6/2020/08/25/00-54-51-730_0eb4866225a82a42.webp","destWidth":1200,"destHeight":600,"sourceBytes":51817,"destBytes":37198,"author":"Dave Teare","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/opw7.0/header.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn26@2020_6/2020/08/25/00-54-51-730_0eb4866225a82a42.webp","https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/opw7.0/opw7-locked-surface.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn91@2020_3/2020/08/25/00-55-02-701_692722838713e90b.webp","https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/opw7.0/opw7-unlocked.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn88@2020_2/2020/08/25/00-55-12-109_d1d8692f15998e4a.webp","https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/opw7.0/opw7-totp.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn32@2020_1/2020/08/25/00-55-02-901_d0bc517a998b4aa9.webp","https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/opw7.0/opw7-large-type.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn96@2020_1/2020/08/25/00-55-06-017_721186f2082305ae.webp","https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/opw7.0/opw7-search-highlights.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn96@2020_1/2020/08/25/00-55-02-612_40b80bf57b69e04f.webp","https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/opw7.0/opw7-nested-tags.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn8@2020_6/2020/08/25/00-55-00-808_8c4f0a73c318ca0f.webp","https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/opw7.0/opw7-sidebar-vaults.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn87@2020_1/2020/08/25/00-55-06-510_a778b9bc6ff1698f.webp","https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/opw7.0/opw7-manage-vault-access.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn55@2020_3/2020/08/25/00-55-07-246_6385aca25aebf0aa.webp","https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/opw7.0/opw7-mini-login-evernote.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn99@2020_5/2020/08/25/00-55-04-141_e841b271ec7d43c7.webp","https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/opw7.0/opw7-mini-totp-evernote.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn68@2020_5/2020/08/25/00-55-06-293_44985341b0cc8357.webp","https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/opw7.0/opw7-mini-save-login.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn52@2020_2/2020/08/25/00-55-04-267_62dad70b0d7bdf0c.webp","https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/opw7.0/opw7-mini-watchtower.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn74@2020_1/2020/08/25/00-54-58-679_6b42f47b67dc315d.webp","https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/opw7.0/opw7-japanese.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn99@2020_5/2020/08/25/00-55-05-017_3c504849c25fdd69.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598316891418},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:54:51","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:54:51","title":"Introducing support for U2F security keys","link":"https://blog.1password.com/introducing-support-for-u2f-security-keys/","description":"\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/u2f/header.png' class='webfeedsFeaturedVisual' alt='Introducing support for U2F security keys' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p class=\"introduction\">You can now use U2F-compatible security keys as a second factor for your 1Password account.</p>\n<p>Last year we <a href=\"https://blog.1password.com/multi-factor-authentication-in-1password/\">added two-factor authentication</a> to provide another layer of protection for your 1Password account. When this is enabled, you are prompted to enter your second factor any time you sign in from a new device.</p>\n<p>Initially, that second factor was a time-based one-time password generated by an authenticator app on your phone. Today, I&rsquo;m happy to announce a new option: we now offer support for Universal 2nd Factor (U2F)-compatible security keys. This is done via the new <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/05/webauthn\">WebAuthn API</a>, and we���re excited to be among the first services to adopt this new browser standard. WebAuthn is backwards-compatible with U2F, so all certified U2F security keys will work with our WebAuthn-enabled flow.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/u2f/chrome-security-key-prompt.png' alt='Security key prompt in Chrome' title='Security key prompt in Chrome' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<h2 id=\"what-is-a-security-key\">What is a security key?</h2>\n<p>Security keys are small physical devices that can be used as a second factor. Support is built into most web browsers and works with many online services like Google and GitHub.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>���WebAuthn brings to life the concept of using an external security key across multiple devices and platforms, with no shared secrets among services. It���s exciting to see 1Password implement WebAuthn support to enable YubiKey hardware-backed authentication for their users.��� ��� <em>Derek Hanson, VP Solutions Architecture and Alliances at Yubico</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When you&rsquo;re prompted for your second factor, just tap a button on your security key and you&rsquo;re in. No need to find your phone, open the authenticator app, and type out the six-digit code while trying to race the countdown.</p>\n<h2 id=\"using-your-key-with-1password\">Using your key with 1Password</h2>\n<p>Security keys are currently supported on 1Password.com in the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and Edge. (It&rsquo;s coming to Safari 13 this fall.)</p>\n<p>So while it works great as your second factor in those browsers, for now you&rsquo;ll still need an authenticator app set up to use with the 1Password desktop and mobile apps (and any unsupported browsers).</p>\n<p>You can add your security keys now by heading over to the 1Password web app and visiting our new <a href=\"https://start.1password.com/profile/2fa\">Two-Factor Authentication page</a>.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/u2f/manage-2fa-page.png' alt='Two-Factor Authentication page in 1Password web app' title='Two-Factor Authentication page in 1Password web app' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>Your Master Password, which is used for the encryption of your data, still remains the most important thing protecting your 1Password account. Adding a second factor does <em>not</em> mean you can get away with a weaker Master Password.</p>\n<h2 id=\"where-to-buy-a-security-key\">Where to buy a security key</h2>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in getting a security key, you can buy a <a href=\"https://www.yubico.com/store/\">YubiKey</a> from the Yubico Store, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Feitian-ePass-NFC-FIDO-Security/dp/B01M1R5LRD/\">Feitian</a> keys from Amazon, or <a href=\"https://store.google.com/product/titan_security_key_kit\">Titan</a> keys from the Google Store. Any device that supports the U2F standard will work.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-it-works-under-the-hood\">How it works under the hood</h2>\n<p>WebAuthn is a pretty neat implementation based on public key crypto, and resolves security vulnerabilities like phishing.

The weather did its best to try to get in our way as the ice storm caused some of us to arrive a day later than expected. We all made it though, and I think we all took turns assuring the Californians that this weather is not normal.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/rickconf/electric-logo.png' alt='RickConf &#39;Logo&#39;' title='RickConf &#39;Logo&#39;' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>RickConf was an opportunity for everyone that works on 1Password.com to get together, hang out, and prototype some ideas for the future. 1Password is a remote company, so this is one of the few times per year where the whole team gets together.

I won���t go into what those were, but I���m super excited for us to polish up that code and get it into your hands.</p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Mon, 23 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":10468,"bgimg":"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/rickconf/header.png","linkMd5":"92b2d804d4729fced0375880707cc65d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn66@2020_3/2020/08/25/00-54-56-261_91995198b4033b41.webp","destWidth":1030,"destHeight":387,"sourceBytes":84158,"destBytes":41802,"author":"Rick Fillion","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/rickconf/header.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn66@2020_3/2020/08/25/00-54-56-261_91995198b4033b41.webp","https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/rickconf/electric-logo.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn51@2020_6/2020/08/25/00-55-03-287_5a9944de0ac7efde.webp","https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/rickconf/team.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn4@2020_6/2020/08/25/00-55-06-905_160fd88c4c014cd7.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598316891418},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:54:51","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:54:51","title":"Mozilla has selected 1Password X as a Recommended Extension for Firefox","link":"https://blog.1password.com/mozilla-extensions-program/","description":"\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/mozilla-extension-program/header.png' class='webfeedsFeaturedVisual' alt='Mozilla has selected 1Password X as a Recommended Extension for Firefox' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p class=\"introduction\"><a href=\"https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/recommended-extensions-program\">Mozilla���s Recommended Extensions</a> program rigorously vets Firefox extensions for quality and security. Out of thousands of extensions, fewer than 100 have been chosen, so we���re incredibly proud that 1Password X meets their high standards.</p>\n<p>Third-party developers build extensions to add features and customise how your browser works. There are extensions for everything from ad blockers to coupon codes, translation to social sharing, and more. 1Password X brings the full functionality of 1Password into your browser, making it easy for you to sign in to sites, use suggested passwords, and find what you need in your account.</p>\n<p>However, not all extensions are created equal. Downloading the wrong extension can pose a serious threat to your privacy and security. App add-ons and extensions require you to grant permission to read and even change your data on the websites that you visit, which gives them quite a bit of power.</p>\n<p>With that level of access, a malicious extension that&rsquo;s been granted access to your full browser could steal your data, track your movements, or capture and store your passwords ��� all without you even noticing.</p>\n<p>In an effort to help discover and defend against rogue extensions, <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/futurereleases/2019/02/19/keeping-add-ons-safe-for-our-users/\">Mozilla launched their new Recommended Extensions initiative</a>. The program was created to &ldquo;foster a curated list of extensions that meet [their] highest standards of security, utility, and user experience.&rdquo; Firefox users can feel good about installing these extensions because they know their information will be safe.</p>\n<p>All Mozilla Recommend Extensions, including 1Password X, go through a standard, rigorous <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org\">review process on AMO</a>. When they invited us to join the program, we were asked to undergo an additional review by Mozilla&rsquo;s editorial staff. This review was primarily concerned with the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Is the extension really good at what it does?</li>\n<li>Does the extension offer an exceptional user experience?</li>\n<li>Is the extension relevant to a general audience?</li>\n<li>Is the extension safe?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We���re committed to keeping the quality of the 1Password X experience high, and pride ourselves on the level of security we offer. All the information you store in 1Password, no matter what app, extension, or browser you use, is encrypted and can only be accessed from a device you&rsquo;ve already approved. Your data is yours, and only you have the keys to unlock it.</p>\n<section class=\"c-call-to-action-box c-call-to-action-box--yellow c-call-to-action-box--background-author c-call-to-action-box--background-author-yellow\">\n<div class=\"c-call-to-action-box__author\">\n<img src=\"https://blog.1password.com/img/authors/andrewbeyer.jpg\" class=\"c-call-to-action-box__author-image c-call-to-action-box__author-image--yellow\" alt=\"Andrew Beyer\"/>\n</div>\n<div class=\"c-call-to-action-box__content\">\n<h3 class=\"c-call-to-action-box__title c-call-to-action-box__title--yellow\">Sign up for 30 days free!</h3>\n<div class=\"c-call-to-action-box__text c-call-to-action-box__text--yellow\">\nWant to try 1Password X in Firefox?

This new legislation goes into effect January 2020 and is designed to protect consumers by setting higher security standards for smart devices.</p>\n<p>To comply with this <a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB327\">new law</a>, companies will either need to set a unique password for the device at the time of manufacture or prompt people to set a new password during the initial device setup.</p>\n<p>This is a big step in the right direction for safety and privacy. Too often, people in a rush to get up and running will leave the default password in place rather than taking the time to set a strong password. Unfortunately, the default passwords are trivial to crack.</p>\n<p>As well as putting our privacy at risk, default passwords make it possible for hackers to take control of thousands of devices at once and use them to bring down other services. Twitter, Spotify, and Reddit have all been attacked in this way.</p>\n<p>Although smart devices make our lives easier, they can also make us more vulnerable. Banning default passwords will certainly help with security, but it isn���t enough on its own. People are still likely to pick insecure, easy-to-remember passwords when setting up a new device. It&rsquo;s important to use strong, unique passwords everywhere ��� from your Twitter account to your espresso machine, and without a password manager, that���s just not practical.</p>\n<p>���People are often too relaxed about the security of their home network, and leaving the default password on smart devices is far too common,��� says Jeff Shiner, 1Password CEO. ���While requiring users to create new passwords on launch is a great first step, manufacturers still have a greater responsibility to ensure software is frequently updated and patched against security threats.���</p>\n<p>While this current law only applies to California, the benefits will be felt nationwide for any devices manufactured within the state. And it���s likely only a matter of time before other laws start to pop up in other states.</p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 05 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":10468,"bgimg":"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/cf-password-law/header.png","linkMd5":"07fed858f64022b17530fe20683b312f","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn54@2020_1/2020/08/25/00-54-51-792_07cc9570bbc51dbb.webp","destWidth":2080,"destHeight":800,"sourceBytes":260387,"destBytes":66386,"author":"Sarah Brown","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/cf-password-law/header.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn54@2020_1/2020/08/25/00-54-51-792_07cc9570bbc51dbb.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598316891417},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:54:51","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:54:51","title":"1Password is for Families","link":"https://blog.1password.com/1password-is-for-families/","description":"\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/for-families/header.jpg' class='webfeedsFeaturedVisual' alt='1Password is for Families' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p class=\"introduction\">Today we���re celebrating Family Day here in Ontario and throughout other parts of Canada. It���s a great way to remind ourselves of the people in our lives who are always here when we need them. Family can mean a lot of different things ��� my brother-in-law Mike calling to ask if I need help shovelling snow, my aunt sharing a new card game, or a friend who needs a ride to an appointment ��� in the end, family means ���together���.</p>\n<h2 id=\"sharing-together\">Sharing together</h2>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/for-families/sharing-family-items.png' alt='Sharing together' title='Sharing together' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>Most of the time, sharing lives together is as simple as sharing a meal, sharing how your day was, and ��� these days ��� sharing Wi-Fi passwords and Netflix accounts. 1Password Families can���t cook for you or get your kids to clean their rooms, but it���s great with online accounts. In fact, it���s great for sharing a lot more than passwords, too.</p>\n<p>The Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang got me thinking about international travel, and I���m reminded of Jeff���s post about his son���s trip to Texas. He used 1Password Families to help his son prepare for his trip to the USA for an international gymnastics training camp. I���ll let him tell the story:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I created a Texas Trip vault [and] added our passports, contact info, and a credit card for emergencies (new headphones are not an emergency). In went the flights, insurance policies, consent forms, and all the rest. Finally, I added passwords for all the ways he could reach us, from Skype to FaceTime to Zoom; although, trying to get a 15-year-old to actually talk to his parents was another matter.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It was really quite reassuring to know that all of that information was there for him to easily access on either his Mac or his iPhone.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And that���s just one example. There are as many different ways to use 1Password Families as there are families. You get to <a href=\"https://support.1password.com/family-sharing\">choose who has access to shared information</a>, and everyone gets their own personal vault for stuff that���s private. But no matter what you share with your family, you can be sure that your secrets are safe.</p>\n<h2 id=\"recovering-your-peace-of-mind\">Recovering your peace of mind</h2>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/for-families/family-recovery.png' alt='Recovering your peace of mind' title='Recovering your peace of mind' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>One of my favourite taglines for 1Password is ���Go ahead, forget your passwords���. Taking that plunge into a world of not knowing my passwords was scary, but now that I���m here, I can���t imagine going back. There���s only one password I need to remember now: my Master Password. But what happens if I forget that?! I���d normally start to feel my peace of mind slip away just thinking about that, but thanks to my family, I don���t have to worry.</p>\n<p>Nobody at 1Password ever has access to your information. That means that if you forget your Master Password, we can���t help you recover your account. But if you have a 1Password Families membership, you can <a href=\"https://support.1password.com/family-organizer\">designate another family member</a> who can help you recover your account. You get to have peace of mind because you���re in control.</p>\n<h2 id=\"make-the-switch\">Make the switch</h2>\n<p>If you have a 1Password account and have been considering inviting your family, there���s never been a better time. There are a ton of benefits to <a href=\"https://1password.com/families\">1Password Families</a>, some of which I mentioned above. A family account lets you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Share vaults securely. <a href=\"https://support.1password.com/create-share-vaults\">Shared vaults</a> show up on your family���s devices instantly.</li>\n<li>Recover accounts. If someone in your family forgets their Master Password or can���t find their Secret Key, a <a href=\"https://support.1password.com/family-organizer\">family organizer</a> can help <a href=\"https://support.1password.com/recovery\">recover their account</a>.</li>\n<li>Simplify payment. A single subscription covers a family of 5, with room to grow.</li>\n</ul>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/for-families/invite-all-the-family-banner.png' alt='Invite all the family' title='Invite all the family' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<h3 id=\"upgrading-to-a-family-account-is-as-easy-as-inviting-more-people\">Upgrading to a family account is as easy as inviting more people.</h3>\n<p>Simply sign in to your account on 1Password.com and click Invite People in the sidebar. ����</p>\n<h2 id=\"love-for-our-1password-family\">Love for our 1Password Family</h2>\n<p>With that, I���d like to wrap this up with a special thank you to all of our extended 1Password family members. Without the lovely people I work with every day and all the amazing customers who have supported us over the years, 1Password wouldn���t be where it is today. Thank you!

With reports, you can track how your team uses 1Password and give everyone access to what they need. If anything doesn’t look right, it’s easy to take action.</p> \n<p>Here’s how you can use <a href=\"https://support.1password.com/reports/\">reports</a> to help your team succeed and make the most out of 1Password Business.</p> \n<h2 id=\"understand-employee-needs\">Understand employee needs</h2> \n<p>Reports hone in on the heart of your company: the people. Everyone slots 1Password into their workflow in a way that best suits their needs. To learn how an employee uses 1Password, create a usage report. It tells you when they last signed in and how many vaults, groups, and items they can access. You’ll also see a list of all the shared items they’ve used and when they last used them.</p> \n<img src=\"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2020/business-using-reports/usagereport-user.png\" alt=\"1Password Usage Report for specified user\" title=\"1Password Usage Report for specified user\" style=\"max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;\" /> \n<p>You can use the item list to help you decide what they need access to. To make it easier, sort the item list by vault, or focus the report around a specific vault. If they haven’t used any items in a vault, or they’ve used items they shouldn’t have, you may want to reduce their access.</p> \n<p>Usage reports also highlight employees that aren���t using 1Password, or that haven’t for while, so you can intervene early and offer training or support. They might need help getting started with 1Password, or they may not have access to the items they need.</p> \n<p>Usage reports also come in handy when someone leaves the company. Before you delete their account, create a report so you have a list of shared passwords to change. It’s much easier than changing every single password in every vault they had access to.</p> \n<h2 id=\"see-who-uses-shared-information\">See who uses shared information</h2> \n<p>A password manager is the easiest and most secure way to share and maintain passwords among colleagues. If you haven���t already, it���s time to say goodbye to unsafe practices like using shared spreadsheets or public-facing whiteboards to track and share passwords. Instead, use vaults in 1Password to store and organize everything.</p> \n<img src=\"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2020/business-using-reports/usagereport-vault.png\" alt=\"1Password Usage Report for specified vault\" title=\"1Password Usage Report for specified vault\" style=\"max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;\" /> \n<p>To learn how people use a specific vault, create a vault report. You’ll see when the vault was created and last updated, and the number of people and groups with access to it. You’ll also see a list of vault items, including when each person last accessed them.</p> \n<p>You can use the vault report to help you organize information and decide who needs access to it. Sort the item list by title to see who uses each item, and which items are most popular. You may want to move less-used or sensitive items into a vault shared with fewer people. Or, if you see the vault is being used for items it wasn’t intended for, you could create a new vault for that purpose.</p> \n<img src=\"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2020/business-using-reports/usagereport-select.png\" alt=\"1Password Usage Report - Selecting Person\" title=\"1Password Usage Report - Selecting Person\" style=\"max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;\" /> \n<p>If you’d like to see how a specific employee uses the vault, choose them from People Included. If they’ve used items they shouldn’t have access to, or they haven’t used the vault at all, you may want to remove them.</p> \n<h2 id=\"track-adoption-for-your-team\">Track adoption for your team</h2> \n<p>While usage reports give you a granular look at how individual employees use 1Password, team reports pull back to give you a bird’s-eye view of how your whole team is using it. A team report includes the total number of people, groups, and vaults, a list of everyone on the team, and details about their usage.</p> \n<p>When they last signed in and the number of devices they’ve signed in from hints at how often they use 1Password. People with only one device haven’t used the 1Password apps. And if they haven’t signed in for a while, they may have forgotten their credentials. Reach out to see if they need help.</p> \n<p>The number of personal items helps you understand how people use their Private vault. Have they saved all their work accounts in 1Password, or only a handful? If they’ve saved far more items than others, it could mean they’re using it for personal data, too. Encourage them to redeem their <a href=\"https://support.1password.com/link-family/\">free 1Password Families membership</a> for personal use.</p> \n<p>Many companies require two-factor authentication, and now you can find out who’s turned it on for 1Password. To make it easier to see, sort by the 2FA column. It’s a good way to assess adoption if you’ve <a href=\"https://support.1password.com/two-factor-authentication/#manage-two-factor-authentication-for-your-team\">enforced two-factor authentication</a>.</p> \n<h2 id=\"get-an-overview-of-your-business-account\">Get an overview of your business account</h2> \n<p>Step out even further and create an overview report. This one is all about the numbers, with a breakdown of the people, vaults, and items in the account.</p> \n<img src=\"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2020/business-using-reports/usage-overview.png\" alt=\"1Password Overview Report\" title=\"1Password Overview Report\" style=\"max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;\" /> \n<p>This dashboard view shows you how many people and guests are on your account, and whether they’re active, suspended, or in recovery. Keep an eye on your guest count if you want to stick to the 20 included, and to make sure no one <a href=\"https://blog.1password.com/ghosts-passwords-past/\">overstays their welcome</a>.</p> \n<p>Compare the number of items and vaults that are private and shared, so you can judge if you need to make any changes. You’ll also see how many groups and devices are on the account, and your secure file storage.</p> \n<h2 id=\"make-the-most-of-1password-business\">Make the most of 1Password Business</h2> \n<p>With reports, you’ll have a better understanding of how your team uses 1Password. Use reports to measure adoption, organize your data, and increase your security. If you use 1Password Teams, you’ll see the entire usage history for your account when you upgrade. <a href=\"https://support.1password.com/reports/\">Learn how to create reports in 1Password Business</a>.</p> \n<p>Is there another report you’d like to create in 1Password? <a href=\"mailto:business@1password.com\">Let us know!</a></p> \n<section class=\"c-call-to-action-box c-call-to-action-box--yellow c-call-to-action-box--background-author c-call-to-action-box--background-author-yellow\"> \n <div class=\"c-call-to-action-box__author\"> \n  <img src=\"https://blog.1password.com/img/authors/sarahbrown.jpg\" class=\"c-call-to-action-box__author-image c-call-to-action-box__author-image--yellow\" alt=\"Sarah Brown\" /> \n </div> \n <div class=\"c-call-to-action-box__content\"> \n  <h3 class=\"c-call-to-action-box__title c-call-to-action-box__title--yellow\">Sign up for 30 days free</h3> \n  <div class=\"c-call-to-action-box__text c-call-to-action-box__text--yellow\"> \n   <pre><code>Use reports in 1Password Business and set your team up for success.\n</code></pre> \n  </div> \n  <a href=\"https://1password.com/sign-up/\" class=\"c-call-to-action-box__link-href c-call-to-action-box__link-href--stacked c-call-to-action-box__link-href--yellow\" data-on=\"click\" data-event-category=\"CTA\" data-event-action=\"call-to-action-button\"> Try 1Password Business </a> \n </div> \n</section>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 22 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":10468,"bgimg":"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2020/business-using-reports/header.png","linkMd5":"f2a48fcf05569462fe2c8a70d2098062","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn62@2020_3/2020/08/25/00-54-51-709_d8dfc4229998beff.webp","destWidth":2080,"destHeight":800,"sourceBytes":34655,"destBytes":49622,"author":"Sarah Brown","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2020/business-using-reports/header.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn62@2020_3/2020/08/25/00-54-51-709_d8dfc4229998beff.webp","https://blog.1password.com/posts/2020/business-using-reports/usagereport-user.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn12@2020_1/2020/08/25/00-55-10-776_3bc62f7c883acbf8.webp","https://blog.1password.com/posts/2020/business-using-reports/usagereport-vault.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn84@2020_1/2020/08/25/00-55-01-597_f2da4adb9396e1b5.webp","https://blog.1password.com/posts/2020/business-using-reports/usagereport-select.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn88@2020_6/2020/08/25/00-55-01-393_c03b713463b149cc.webp","https://blog.1password.com/posts/2020/business-using-reports/usage-overview.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn62@2020_6/2020/08/25/00-54-59-451_ddd4095278bd7027.webp","https://blog.1password.com/img/authors/sarahbrown.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn63@2020_5/2020/08/25/00-55-08-297_4fbf004afcdefa0c.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598316891415},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:54:51","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:54:51","title":"Managing security when remote work is thrust upon you","link":"https://blog.1password.com/remote-work-security-people/","description":"\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2020/remote-security-management/header.png' class='webfeedsFeaturedVisual' alt='Managing security when remote work is thrust upon you' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p class=\"introduction\">Some organizations are born with <a href=\"https://blog.1password.com/remote-work-culture/\">remote culture</a> and security, some achieve it, and some have it thrust upon them. It&rsquo;s important to understand that setting the wrong goals can backfire. Take a step back and look at some of the greater changes you face.</p>\n<p>1Password came into the world as a fully remote organization 14 years ago. Even though we&rsquo;ve opened two offices in that time, the majority of our staff still work remotely. Although nobody has an easy time of anything these days, we were in a far better position to adapt than most when we had to suddenly shutter those offices on March 10, 2020. It didn&rsquo;t require the development and implementation of <a href=\"https://blog.1password.com/remote-work-security-tips/\">new security policies and practices</a> for remote workers.</p>\n<p>Yet we can understand what those suddenly thrust into such a change are confronted with.</p>\n<p>It is our business to help people and organizations improve their security in ways that work for those people. Security for real people in real organizations is our bread and butter. Because of that, and our long-term experience being mostly remote, I feel that we can offer some advice that goes beyond the innumerable checklists out there.</p>\n<p>What I say here isn&rsquo;t going to be exhaustive by any means. Indeed, I&rsquo;m deliberately keeping it short. And this introduction has already gone on too long.</p>\n<h2 id=\"understand-your-goals\">Understand your goals</h2>\n<p>Start by determining if your goal is genuine information security for your organization, or if you&rsquo;re seeking CYA (Cover Your Anterior) security. The latter isn&rsquo;t so much aimed at preventing security failures as it is at shifting blame and responsibility for them.</p>\n<p>CYA security:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You create a policy that is difficult for people to realistically comply with.</li>\n<li>You wait for something to go wrong.</li>\n<li>You find a person who failed to comply and shift the blame to them.</li>\n<li>Your anterior is covered.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The major problem, of course, with CYA security, is that it doesn&rsquo;t prevent things from going wrong. It also leads to unhappy people, who are either perpetually stressed by not being able to meet demands or who have simply developed contempt for those creating and enforcing those security policies. The benefit is that you are covered.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, if you wish to promote genuine security, you&rsquo;ll develop policies and practices that reduce the chance of things going wrong. This approach should reduce real risk, but it does mean that failures are the responsibility of those designing the policies and practices.</p>\n<p>In real life, policies are going to be a mixture of both. It is not always possible to avoid some CYA security, but you should recognize when you are doing it. What is different now (as you have to learn how to secure your people and organization with everyone working from home) is that there will be more cases where genuine security and CYA security come into conflict.</p>\n<p>Two problems come into play more in the current situation: security fatigue and security absolutism. <strong>Security fatigue</strong> occurs when people are given so many security-related things to worry about, they are likely to just give up.\n<strong>Security absolutism</strong> is the incorrect belief that security is an all-or-nothing concept instead of taking incremental steps to reduce risk. And it&rsquo;s highly destructive.</p>\n<h2 id=\"all-or-nothing-gets-you-nothing\">&lsquo;All or nothing&rsquo; gets you nothing</h2>\n<p>Let me walk through an example of where fatigue and absolutism come into play and harm security.</p>\n<p>We correctly say that people should have strong and unique passwords for each and every service they use, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that having strong and unique passwords for only <em>some</em> of the sites and services they use does no good. In fact, that kind of absolutist thinking is wrong. Every single time you set a unique password for a service, you are reducing the risk of attack, even if you haven&rsquo;t done so for absolutely all of the others. We need to remind ourselves that achievable incremental improvements are real security improvements.</p>\n<p>Suppose Molly looks at her duplicate passwords report using <a href=\"https://watchtower.1password.com/\">1Password Watchtower</a> and sees 40 logins that do not have unique passwords. If Molly believes she needs to fix each and every one of those to be secure, she may just give up. But if she takes only a few at a time, starting with the services she uses most often, or that need the most protection, she can make real and substantive improvements.</p>\n<p>Another example is software updates. Each and every time one of your users apply updates and security patches to their systems and software, they improve their security and the security of your organization. And this is still true even if they don&rsquo;t patch everything. But if people think they have to update the firmware on their internet-connected toaster-fridge for there to be any gain from using the latest version of their web browser, they may not attempt to keep anything updated at all.</p>\n<p>To genuinely improve security, we must help people understand that they should go after low-hanging fruit. Doing so will reduce their risk and the risk to your organization. This involves communicating that there are real, reasonable things they can do that will improve security and that security is not all-or-nothing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"not-lake-wobegon\">Not Lake Wobegon</h2>\n<p>You need to try to understand your users. They are trying to do their jobs in what might be difficult and unusual circumstances. Their goal is to do their jobs; their goal is not to make the IT managers happy. And as you have to have your users perform more of their own IT tasks at home, you need to be careful to not target your rules and guidelines to what you imagine your average user to be. You need policies that will work for pretty much everyone, and not just the average and above.</p>\n<p>You might also assume that your average user is a lot like you. As an IT or information security specialist, you may automatically think that everyone in every household has their own computer. But many households have one shared computer. They may even use the same account on that computer. You need to consider that not everyone has a private place to work at home, particularly with children out of school. There will also be a wide range of computing skills. So you can&rsquo;t just target your instructions to what you imagine your average user to be. You want everyone to improve their security, not just the most sophisticated users.</p>\n<p>One thing that we&rsquo;ve found success with at 1Password is that we&rsquo;ve set up a system to granting exemptions for specific policies. We would much rather know that Kim needs to use a third-party browser extension (and what that extension is) than to have Kim and others simply not comply with our browser extension policy. We don&rsquo;t get mad when people ask for exemptions. We get mad when we find out that someone should have asked and didn&rsquo;t.</p>\n<h2 id=\"help-and-support\">Help and support</h2>\n<p>You can&rsquo;t expect people to comply with security policies if you don&rsquo;t give them the means to do so. You need to provide the help and support that your people will need to succeed at what you&rsquo;re asking them to do. Sometimes it&rsquo;s as simple as making sure they have <a href=\"https://1password.com/business\">the best password manager</a> out there (hint, hint). That one is easy.</p>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s take another example: If you are going to ask people to make sure their home Wi-Fi is using WPA2, you have to do more than say, &ldquo;look at the (usually terrible) documentation for the router (that they don&rsquo;t even know they have).&rdquo;\nThis is going to be a tricky one. Each household is going to be different, and you are going to spend one-on-one time to help many people through that. This will take time and patience.</p>\n<p>We learned something like this the hard way. One of our policies for people&rsquo;s home machines is full disk (or file system) encryption. At the time we put this policy together, the only people with Windows machines were developers. Only later did we learn that Bitlocker isn&rsquo;t available on Windows Home edition. Since then, we&rsquo;ve paid for people to move to Windows Professional, and we have a few people who can talk others through setting that up.</p>\n<p>In general, when you roll out a policy, be sure you have the support in place, so people don&rsquo;t give up in frustration.</p>\n<h2 id=\"understand-what-you-can-and-cant-control\">Understand what you can and can&rsquo;t control</h2>\n<p>Just as you have to steer your users to go after the low-hanging fruit, you will have to do the same in terms of what you can control or see about your users&rsquo; systems.</p>\n<p>Managers, particularly IT and security managers, like to know what&rsquo;s going on with their systems and with their people. There&rsquo;s a sense of visibility into activity you have when you can see people in an office, and when they&rsquo;re on your network using machines, you provide for them. You aren&rsquo;t going to have that. Even if you supply people&rsquo;s home devices so you can install your monitoring systems on them, you won&rsquo;t have the kind of awareness you want.</p>\n<p>This doesn&rsquo;t mean that you have to be blind. You can, for example, generate a number of useful <a href=\"https://support.1password.com/reports/\">reports with 1Password Business</a>. There will be plenty of other things that you can and should see, but I&rsquo;d also encourage you to accept that people&rsquo;s home networks are not your networks. Highly-intrusive tracking and monitoring of those is fraught with problems, particularly because those home networks are used by others in the household and for non-work activity. Before installing monitoring tools on those, be aware that some introduce points of attack, so you need to let your people know that you are doing so and that you don&rsquo;t have the right to know about the non-work activity on those networks.</p>\n<h2 id=\"real-security\">Real security</h2>\n<p>By understanding your goals, incorporating flexibility, offering sufficient support to your people, and learning to trust in what you&rsquo;ve built, you can get through uncertain times with information security intact.

Data exposure can always leave you vulnerable, so it���s a good idea to take Marriott up on their offer for a <a href=\"https://answers.kroll.com/us/index.html#enrollment-options\">free year of WebWatcher</a> to monitor your information. They also brought up a rather <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/lianeyvkoff/2018/11/16/a-tesla-owner-complains-to-customer-service-gets-more-than-he-bargained-for/\">embarrassing incident for Tesla</a> in which a disgruntled customer complaining to their customer support forum got more than he bargained for. Instead of just an answer, a support agent ended up giving him administrative permissions for the entire forum! That&rsquo;s right, he was granted full access to the entire forum. There���s going above and beyond to help your users and then there���s giving them the ability to not only edit and delete any post but also gave him access to full profile information for every single user. Including Elon Musk.</p>\n<p>And according to this week���s guest, that sort of thing isn���t as uncommon as you���d like to believe. Matt and Roo talked to Charles about the research he did for his book, which included studying a number of older hacks against large companies and organizations.</p>\n<p>With how fast technology moves I would think studying older hacks wouldn���t be useful, so I was surprised to learn that���s not exactly the case. Older hacks have a lot to teach people, both in how to prevent hackers from accessing your information as well as what sort of information and organizations may be most vulnerable.</p>\n<p>Charles covered the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2014/12/18/the-sony-pictures-hack-explained/?utm_term=.406c8af8f45f\">Sony Pictures hack</a> from 2014 which I was familiar with and I remember the impact it had on Hollywood when that hack exposed pay gap information between lead actors and actresses. I was fascinated to hear Charles talk about these corporate hacks can expose how complacent companies can be with their security. As companies like Sony grow, new security requirements come into play that can be difficult to implement. And as they are primarily an entertainment company, it may come as no surprise that security was not their first instinct. But what was surprising to me is that they���d already been attacked at least once before on the PlayStation side of the business, but hadn���t learned their lesson.</p>\n<p>The best part? It turns out that the November 2014 leak revealed a deep structural failure at Sony. There was a file with plain text passwords simply labeled ���passwords���. Doesn���t take much digging to crack that code.</p>\n<p>These stories really do feel like modern-day parables for businesses, showing how even companies that have been hacked can fool themselves into thinking everything is okay. When in reality they are just as vulnerable. And while those parables may be applicable to a larger scale business, I know that I often fall into that trap myself.</p>\n<p>This week���s user question was a great one and one I���m ashamed I haven���t asked before: if you give a PDF app access to your cloud drive, would they be able to rifle through everything else stored there? The short, but scary answer is, yes. So it���s a good idea to be very careful about what applications you give permissions to and to do your research before blindly clicking ���allow access���. Which means I have some research to do before de-authorizing some third-party applications.</p>\n<p>As always, they ended the episode trying to see who could most accurately pronounce a place sent in by Twitter user @toonetown: Tooele.

Today we���re proud to announce an enhancement to how 1Password finds and identifies breached accounts.</p>\n<p>1Password can now use <a href=\"https://haveibeenpwned.com/\">Have I Been Pwned</a> to find accounts that have been compromised based on the email address associated with the account. It can even do this without needing to share your email address with anybody.</p>\n<p>Before we dive in to learn about the details, take a look at the awesome work Matt and Jasper did to bring this to life.</p>\n<div class=\"embed embed-16x9\">\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VKW7f5oI9X4\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe><br>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"breach-report\">Breach Report</h2>\n<p>There���s actually a fair amount to unpack here, and it���s difficult to see detail on a video, so let���s break down the breach report in screenshot form.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/b5-wt-hibp/watchtower-data-found.png' alt='Breach Report' title='Breach Report' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>The Breach Report is split into three sections.</p>\n<p>The top most section is a list of websites where an account with your email address has been identified as having been compromised, but you don���t have any information about this website in 1Password.</p>\n<p>That���s amazingly powerful as 1Password can help you identify breaches that impact you without you having actually added information to 1Password. In this case, you���re going to want to generate a unique strong password for that website, and while you���re at it you should consider adding it to 1Password.</p>\n<p>If it���s a website for which you have no interest in having an account, you should delete the account as opposed to ignore it. Accounts often have additional data, such as a mailing address or maybe a phone number. You should be protecting that private information, and thanks to excellent pieces of legislation like the GDPR most websites have a way to request permanent deletion of your data.</p>\n<p>The second section lists breached websites for which you���ve got an item in 1Password, but 1Password suspects that password to be compromised. You���ll definitely want to create a new password for that website.</p>\n<p>The last section lists breaches for which you���ve got an item in 1Password, but you���ve already updated the password so there���s nothing more to do.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-does-it-work\">How Does It Work?</h2>\n<p>The Breach Report is based on a new service provided by <a href=\"https://haveibeenpwned.com/\">Have I Been Pwned</a> which allows 1Password to query for compromised accounts based on an email address. 1Password can achieve this without needing to share the email address with Have I Been Pwned because this new service functions much like its Pwned Passwords service, and uses the same <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-anonymity\">K-anonymity</a> model. This model allows 1Password to work with Have I Been Pwned to find breaches without needing to share sensitive information with Have I Been Pwned. Let���s take a look at how that works���</p>\n<p>Have I Been Pwned has a database with over 5 billion compromised accounts obtained from the various data breaches around the internet over the last few years. This database contains the email address associated with the account as well as a SHA-1 hash of the password that was compromised. The new service allows 1Password to look up entries in that database based on the email address.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/b5-wt-hibp/rick-email-hash.png' alt='Email Hash Illustration' title='Email Hash Illustration' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>In order to perform a lookup, 1Password takes the email address associated with your account, and hashes that using SHA-1. Sending that full SHA-1 hash to the server would provide too much information and could allow someone to reconstruct your email address. Just like the Pwned Passwords service, this new service only requires the first few characters of the hash, six to be precise.</p>\n<p>Similarly to Pwned Passwords, the process is completed within 1Password itself. Have I Been Pwned sends 1Password a list of possible matches based on the start of the hash that was sent, and 1Password needs to complete the search by looking for exact matches with the full hash that was created in the first step.</p>\n<h2 id=\"bringing-you-more-info-on-compromised-logins\">Bringing You More Info On Compromised Logins</h2>\n<p>When viewing items in the Compromised Logins section of Watchtower, you may notice that some of them have a slightly different banner at the top and include a ���More Info��� link.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/b5-wt-hibp/watchtower-notification.png' alt='Watchtower Notification Banner' title='Watchtower Notification Banner' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>Clicking it will bring up a panel with some information about the breach, letting you know what information in that account was made available.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/b5-wt-hibp/wendy-breachinfo.png' alt='Breach Info' title='Breach Info' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>This was made possible with the additional breach information that is provided by Have I Been Pwned.</p>\n<p>Run, don���t walk, to change the password associated with this Login. And also change the password for any other Login item you might have that happens to share that password (you���re using strong unique passwords everywhere, right?).</p>\n<h2 id=\"taking-watchtower-further\">Taking Watchtower Further</h2>\n<p>Have I Been Pwned allows us to push Watchtower further and do more to keep you safe online. The k-anonymity model used in both this service as well as Pwned Passwords ensures that your privacy is respected, which is incredibly important to us. We���re thrilled to be one of the first services using Have I Been Pwned in this way.</p>\n<p>You can try it today by using Watchtower on 1Password.com, and we���re looking forward to bringing this feature to all of our apps.</p>\n<p>Thank you Troy for building an excellent service that makes this feature possible.</p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Mon, 25 Jun 2018 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":10468,"bgimg":"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/b5-wt-hibp/header.png","linkMd5":"8a34a4fc4c63e6fe381cc4183bf5674a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn33@2020_6/2020/08/25/00-54-56-000_050ecd7d1e4b74b5.webp","destWidth":2400,"destHeight":1200,"sourceBytes":64431,"destBytes":22568,"author":"Rick Fillion","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/b5-wt-hibp/header.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn33@2020_6/2020/08/25/00-54-56-000_050ecd7d1e4b74b5.webp","https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/b5-wt-hibp/watchtower-data-found.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn40@2020_3/2020/08/25/00-55-09-932_141abdffd29a3dc0.webp","https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/b5-wt-hibp/rick-email-hash.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn35@2020_5/2020/08/25/00-55-11-953_1a78e19c8f6ef8d3.webp","https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/b5-wt-hibp/watchtower-notification.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn86@2020_3/2020/08/25/00-54-58-634_ec78d6caf2f462cf.webp","https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/b5-wt-hibp/wendy-breachinfo.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn1@2020_5/2020/08/25/00-54-57-567_1919adc61e386169.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598316891417},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:54:51","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:54:51","title":"Developers: How we use SRP, and you can too","link":"https://blog.1password.com/developers-how-we-use-srp-and-you-can-too/","description":"\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/srp/header.png' class='webfeedsFeaturedVisual' alt='Developers: How we use SRP, and you can too' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p class=\"introduction\">1Password uses a multi-layered approach to protect your data in your account, and Secure Remote Password (SRP) is one of those very important layers. Today we���re announcing that <a href=\"https://github.com/agilebits/srp\">our Go implementation of SRP is available as an open source project</a>. But first, I���d like to show you the benefits SRP brings as an ingredient in the 1Password security parfait.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Donkey:</strong> Oh, you both have <em>layers</em>. Oh. You know, not everybody likes onions. Cake! Everybody loves cake! Cakes have layers!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Shrek:</strong> I don���t care what everyone likes! Ogres are not like cakes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Donkey:</strong> You know what <em>else</em> everybody likes? Parfaits! Have you ever met a person, you say, ���Let���s get some parfait,��� they say, ���Hell no, I don���t like no parfait���? Parfaits are delicious!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"parfaits-delicious-and-secure\">Parfaits: delicious and secure</h2>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/srp/security-served-up.png' alt='1Password themed Parfait' title='1Password themed Parfait' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>The first layer of security in 1Password, your Master Password, protects your data end to end ��� at rest and in transit ��� but we wanted to go further. The second layer is something we call <a href=\"https://support.1password.com/secret-key-security/\">Two-Secret Key Derivation</a>. It combines your Secret Key with your Master Password to greatly improve the strength of the encryption. Thanks to your Secret Key, even if someone got your data from our servers, it would be infeasible to guess your Master Password.</p>\n<p>That still wasn���t enough for us, though. When we first started planning how we were going to securely authenticate between 1Password clients and server, we had a wish list. We wanted to ensure that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>your Master Password is never transmitted or stored on the server.</li>\n<li>eavesdroppers can���t learn anything useful.</li>\n<li>the identity of user and server are mutually authenticated.</li>\n<li>the authentication is encryption-based.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There was actually one other requirement that wasn���t exactly part of the list but applied to every item in the list: we didn���t want to roll our own solution. We know better than to roll our own crypto, and we wanted to find a proven solution that���s been around and has stood the test of time.</p>\n<p>We wanted this layer to be <em>just</em> right.</p>\n<h2 id=\"srp-a-hell-of-a-layer\">SRP: a hell of a layer</h2>\n<p>It took us a while to find what we needed for this layer. (Apparently the marketing department of augmented password-authenticated key agreement protocols is underfunded.) But we eventually found SRP, which ticked all our boxes. SRP is a handshake protocol that makes multiple requests and responses between the client and the server. Now, that may not sound very interesting ��� and I���m not one to show excitement easily ��� but SRP is a hell of a layer. With SRP we can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>authenticate without ever sending a password over the network.</li>\n<li>authenticate without the risk of anyone learning any of your secrets ��� even if they intercept your communication.</li>\n<li>authenticate both the identity of the client and the server to guarantee that a client isn���t communicating with an impostor server.</li>\n<li>authenticate with more than just a binary ���yes��� or ���no���. You actually end up with an encryption key.</li>\n</ul>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/srp/levels-of-security.png' alt='1Password Parfait with layers identified' title='1Password Parfait with layers identified' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>All this makes SRP a great fit for 1Password, and it keeps your data safe in transit. As an added bonus, because SRP is encryption-based, we end up with a session encryption key we can use for transport security (the fourth layer) instead of relying on just Transport Layer Security (TLS).</p>\n<p>So that���s four layers of protection for your 1Password account: Master Password, Secret Key, SRP, and TLS. Now I���d love to show you how SRP works step by step in 1Password.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-1password-uses-srp\">How 1Password uses SRP</h2>\n<p>Before any authentication can be done, the account needs to be enrolled. 1Password does this when you create an account. To use SRP, you���ll need a couple different things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a key derivation function (KDF) that will transform a password (and, in our case, also your Secret Key) into a very large number. We���ve chosen PBKDF2.</li>\n<li>an <a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5054#page-16\">SRP group</a> consisting of two numbers: one very large prime and one generator. There are seven different groups; we���ve chosen the 4096-bit group.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"enrollment\">Enrollment</h2>\n<p>To enroll, the client sends some important information to the server, and the server saves it:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The client generates a random <strong>salt</strong> and <strong>Secret Key</strong>.</li>\n<li>The client asks the user for a <strong>Master Password</strong>.</li>\n<li>The client passes those three values to the KDF to derive <em>x</em>.</li>\n<li>The client uses <em>x</em> and the <strong>SRP group</strong> to calculate what���s called a <strong>verifier</strong>.</li>\n<li>The client sends the <strong>verifier</strong>, <strong>salt</strong>, and <strong>SRP group</strong> to the server.</li>\n<li>The server saves the <strong>verifier</strong> and never transmits it back to the client.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now the account is ready for all future authentication sessions.</p>\n<h2 id=\"authentication\">Authentication</h2>\n<p>To authenticate, the client and server exchange non-secret information. Then the client combines that with a secret that only it knows and the server combines it with a secret only <em>it</em> knows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The client requests the <strong>salt</strong> and the <strong>SRP group</strong> from the server.</li>\n<li>The client asks the user for the <strong>Master Password</strong> and <strong>Secret Key</strong>.</li>\n<li>The client passes those three values (minus the SRP group) to the KDF to derive <em>x</em>.</li>\n<li>The client:</li>\n<li>Generates a random secret number <strong>a</strong>.</li>\n<li>Uses the <strong>SRP group</strong> to calculate a non-secret counterpart <strong>A</strong>.</li>\n<li>Sends <strong>A</strong> to the server.</li>\n<li>The server:</li>\n<li>Generates a random secret <strong>b</strong>.</li>\n<li>Uses the <strong>SRP group</strong> to calculate a non-secret counterpart <strong>B</strong>.</li>\n<li>Sends <strong>B</strong> to the client.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> are exchanged, but <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> remain secrets. Through the power of math, the client (with <em>x</em>, <em>a</em>, <em>B</em>) and the server (with the verifier, <em>A</em>, <em>b</em>) can both arrive at the same very large number using different calculations. This is the number that 1Password uses as a session encryption key.</p>\n<h2 id=\"verification\">Verification</h2>\n<p>The last step is verification. After all, no amount of fancy math will help if the numbers don���t match up between client and server.</p>\n<p>To verify, the client and server exchange encrypted messages:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The client encrypts a message with the <strong>session encryption key</strong> and sends it to the server.</li>\n<li>The server decrypts the message and verifies it.</li>\n<li>The server encrypts its own message with the same <strong>session encryption key</strong> and sends it to the client.</li>\n<li>The client decrypts the message and verifies it.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If the client and server both used the correct inputs then they���ll both have the same session encryption key, which allows them to decrypt and verify the message. If they don���t use the correct inputs, everything fails.</p>\n<p>The verification process proves to the server that the client has <em>x</em>, which can only be derived using the correct Master Password and Secret Key. It also proves to the client that the server has the verifier, which ensures that the client is communicating with the 1Password server, not an impostor.</p>\n<p>Now that it has been verified, the session encryption key can be used to encrypt every message between the client and server going forward.</p>\n<p>As you can see, it���s critical to remember your Master Password and keep your Secret Key safe if you ever want to authenticate your 1Password account. They���re also very important layers, after all. ���� And, like any good parfait, everything comes together to create something better than the individual layers alone.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/srp/delivered-for-you.png' alt='1Password Parfait delivery' title='1Password Parfait delivery' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<h2 id=\"implement-srp-in-your-own-app\">Implement SRP in your own app</h2>\n<p>We love SRP so much that we want to see it used in more of the apps we use. That���s why we want to help you get started with SRP in your own project. Our Go implementation of SRP is available as an open source project:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/agilebits/srp\">GitHub: agilebits/srp</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This package provides functions for both clients and servers, and you only need to BYOKDF (Bring Your Own Key Derivation Function, like any good party). It���s the same code we���re using on our server and in the 1Password command-line tool, so we welcome security researchers to take a look and report any issues through the <a href=\"https://bugcrowd.com/agilebits\">1Password Bugcrowd bug bounty program</a>.</p>\n<p>SRP is one of the less appreciated parts of 1Password, and I hope I���ve explained it well enough for you to implement it in your own project.

It&rsquo;s natural to worry that such apps could be used to collect data about who you meet and where you go.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, there is some clever technology that leaves the user in control and protects privacy, while giving individuals and health authorities the information they need. Apple &amp; Google are introducing that technology to their phones.</p>\n<p>I fully anticipate that I&rsquo;ll enable the relevant app that uses this exposure notification technology when it becomes available, and that I&rsquo;ll encourage others to, as well.</p>\n<h2 id=\"privacy-still-matters\">Privacy still matters</h2>\n<p>It&rsquo;s reasonable to ask whether privacy preservation still matters when there is a pressing and compelling public health need for improved contact tracing. As we face the choice of whether to adopt privacy-preserving tracing apps, privacy-violating apps, or no apps at all, I&rsquo;ll say a few words about why we should choose those that preserve privacy.</p>\n<p>The data that these apps might gather could include where you travel, who you come into contact with, and some of your health information. That data, on perhaps millions of people, will have to be stored somewhere. Even well-intentioned holders of such data would have an enormous burden to protect it; to ensure that it&rsquo;s only used for its intended purposes, and in ways that don&rsquo;t reveal anything more than it should. We can&rsquo;t rely on all holders of such data to be well intentioned.</p>\n<p>So I&rsquo;m delighted that Google and Apple are providing these tools. They enable health authorities to distribute apps without putting themselves in a position to have to defend such a rich trove of data. As you will see below, the scheme is set up so contact tracing secrets don&rsquo;t need to be stored in any central location.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-it-works\">How it works</h2>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve been using the term &ldquo;contact tracing&rdquo; a bit loosely. The technology that Apple and Google are rolling out is more properly called exposure notification. It is based on <a href=\"https://github.com/DP-3T/documents\">Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (DP<sup>3</sup>\nT)</a>. The Apple/Google scheme is based on an older version of DP<sup>3</sup>\nT, and would work something like this. (Because the diagrams come from DP<sup>3</sup>\nT&rsquo;s documentation, I&rsquo;ll use their terminology.)</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Patty and Molly (who may not know each other) both install and enable the app from their health authority.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>As Patty and Molly go about their business, their phones send and receive Ephemeral Identifiers (EphID) to and from other enrolled phones nearby. These EphIDs are changed every 10 minutes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>On Saturday afternoon, they come within Bluetooth distance of each other (a few meters).</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2020/contact-tracing/DP3T_figureAA.jpg' alt='Bluetooth sharing of EphIDs' title='Bluetooth sharing of EphIDs' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>Now Patty and Molly (and others) are running around with lots of these Ephemeral IDs from the day they were received. They are designed to be small, and are purged every 14 days, so even if you are in Bluetooth range of a hundred other devices every 10 minutes, only a few megabytes of data need to be stored.</p>\n<p>The Ephemeral IDs are actually generated using each user&rsquo;s day key. Molly will create a new secret day key each day, as will Patty and every other user. There is no way to figure out the day key from the EphIDs. In the diagrams, the day key is labelled &ldquo;SK<sub>t</sub>\n&rdquo;.</p>\n<h3 id=\"patty-gets-sick\">Patty gets sick</h3>\n<p>If nobody gets sick, none of the information needs to go anywhere. But if Patty is diagnosed with COVID-19 the following Wednesday, she will be asked to share her day keys for previous days (at most 14 days). Note that the day keys have never been shared with other devices, and there is nothing secret about them - they tell nothing about Patty&rsquo;s movements or activities, much less actually identify her.</p>\n<p>The health authority maintains and publishes a database of day keys for people like Patty. In Patty&rsquo;s case, it will include the day keys (along with the dates) for the period they believe she could have been infectious.</p>\n<p>The backend server will periodically send updates to all the phones of these day keys (and which days they correspond to), so Molly&rsquo;s phone will get Patty&rsquo;s day key from the previous Saturday. Molly&rsquo;s app will then use Patty&rsquo;s day key to perform a cryptographic verification check on the Ephemeral IDs she has for that day.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2020/contact-tracing/DP3T_figurePT.jpg' alt='Distributing day keys after diagnosis' title='Distributing day keys after diagnosis' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>If Molly&rsquo;s phone finds a match for an EphID, it still needs to figure out whether she was around Patty long enough and close enough for this to be worrisome. In the Apple/Google scheme, Molly&rsquo;s phone will send the day of the contact, the duration of the contact, and the strength of the Bluetooth signal back to the server. The server will use a tuned algorithm to determine risk scoring. If they believe Patty was very infectious, or Molly and Patty were close to each other for a long period, it will tell Molly&rsquo;s phone that this was a possible exposure. Molly&rsquo;s app will then notify Molly and tell her who to contact and what to do next.</p>\n<p>The Apple/Google scheme differs significantly from the latest version of the DP<sup>3</sup>\nT at this juncture. With the DP<sup>3</sup>\nT scheme, the risk score is computed on Molly&rsquo;s phone, and the backend server updates the various phones on how to compute the risk score.</p>\n<h2 id=\"understanding-privacy\">Understanding privacy</h2>\n<p>My fear is that people won&rsquo;t believe this system is privacy preserving. They will hear that this is a Google/Apple scheme and will incorrectly assume that a great deal of data is given to those companies when that&rsquo;s not the case. People are also likely to falsely assume that health authorities using this can track everyone&rsquo;s movements. After all, without the cleverness of the key and ID generation, along with a way to verify an Ephemeral ID when a day key is published, it would seem impossible to have something that works without having to collect a great deal of information about people&rsquo;s movements.</p>\n<p>Another difficulty with the public understanding of this is that most people will not be able to distinguish between which apps use good privacy preserving mechanisms and which ones don&rsquo;t. I hope, however, that this article will help you understand that these sorts of things can be built with strong privacy protections.</p>\n<section class=\"c-call-to-action-box c-call-to-action-box--purple c-call-to-action-box--background-author c-call-to-action-box--background-author-purple\">\n<div class=\"c-call-to-action-box__author\">\n<img src=\"https://blog.1password.com/img/authors/jeffreygoldberg.jpg\" class=\"c-call-to-action-box__author-image c-call-to-action-box__author-image--purple\" alt=\"Jeffrey Goldberg\"/>\n</div>\n<div class=\"c-call-to-action-box__content\">\n<h3 class=\"c-call-to-action-box__title c-call-to-action-box__title--purple\">Get more security tips</h3>\n<div class=\"c-call-to-action-box__text c-call-to-action-box__text--purple\">\nSign up to our business security mailing list and get advice on running a secure, productive workplace delivered directly to your inbox.\n</div>\n<form accept-charset=\"UTF-8\" action=\"https://agilemail.createsend.com/t/r/s/ohlyduj/\" class=\"oneline\" data-event-category=\"Newsletter\" data-event-action=\"form-newsletter\" id=\"newsletterForm\" method=\"post\">\n<div id=\"hidden-fields\"><input name=\"utf8\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"���\"><input name=\"authenticity_token\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"B2cHFMPBG0KjOnROQ884zCYcI0afwrAx897/qCCfum0=\"></div>\n<input class=\"c-call-to-action-box__newsletter-email c-call-to-action-box__newsletter-email--purple\" id=\"cm-ohlyduj-ohlyduj\" name=\"cm-ohlyduj-ohlyduj\" type=\"email\" placeholder=\"wendy@appleseed.com\">\n<input class=\"c-call-to-action-box__newsletter-button c-call-to-action-box__newsletter-button--purple\" type=\"submit\" value=\"Sign up\">\n</form>\n</div>\n</section>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 06 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":10468,"bgimg":"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2020/contact-tracing/header.png","linkMd5":"d268b2e849d9ea56996609d548aae827","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn85@2020_1/2020/08/25/00-54-55-275_b1b7d0bf466960d4.webp","destWidth":2080,"destHeight":800,"sourceBytes":53980,"destBytes":58494,"author":"Jeffrey Goldberg","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2020/contact-tracing/header.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn85@2020_1/2020/08/25/00-54-55-275_b1b7d0bf466960d4.webp","https://blog.1password.com/posts/2020/contact-tracing/DP3T_figureAA.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn55@2020_4/2020/08/25/00-55-01-937_4dc31c865f49e248.webp","https://blog.1password.com/posts/2020/contact-tracing/DP3T_figurePT.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn52@2020_2/2020/08/25/00-55-10-181_5d6128b053551d82.webp","https://blog.1password.com/img/authors/jeffreygoldberg.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn40@2020_6/2020/08/25/00-55-08-153_55770ff3414a649b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598316891414},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:54:51","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:54:51","title":"Announcing the 1Password command-line tool public beta","link":"https://blog.1password.com/announcing-the-1password-command-line-tool-public-beta/","description":"\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/public-beta/header.jpg' class='webfeedsFeaturedVisual' alt='Announcing the 1Password command-line tool public beta' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p class=\"introduction\">Here at AgileBits, we���ve been working hard over the last few months to bring power users, developers, and administrators more powerful ways to interact with 1Password.

With the <a href=\"https://support.1password.com/explore/teams-pro/\">Pro plan</a>, <code>op list events</code> makes it easy to ingest activity data into the application of your choosing. Be it Splunk, Kibana, Papertrail, or your own tool, <code>op</code> outputs JSON, so it���s simple to work with.</p>\n<p>But we didn���t just build the tool to solve specific requests. It���s flexible enough to handle use cases we haven���t even thought of. The possibilities are endless, and we know you���ll come up with something amazing.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/public-beta/cli-command-blocks.png' alt='CLI command blocks' title='CLI command blocks' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<h2 id=\"-rock-robot-rock-solid-\">���� Rock, robot rock (solid) ����</h2>\n<p>The command structure is similar to tools you already use, providing easy integration with your workflow. Now automated systems can have access to secure credentials without ever storing them in plaintext. Here at AgileBits, for example, we���ve been using <code>op</code> for the last few months as part of our automated build systems. It���s been super useful for fetching secure keys and tokens required for building and deploying 1Password. After a secure <code>op signin</code>, we have a script that fetches the appropriate signing key from a shared vault and automatically signs new builds.</p>\n<p>The tool was written from the ground up with the battle-tested Go programming language, the very same we used to build the 1Password service itself. As with every 1Password client, all encryption and decryption is done on your machine locally, ensuring the highest level of security best practices you���ve come to expect from the entire family of 1Password apps.</p>\n<h2 id=\"get-yo-nix-on\">Get yo��� *NIX on</h2>\n<p>Our dreams of late have been filled with penguins.

We���ve been excited for this release since <a href=\"https://blog.1password.com/1password-apple-betas/\">iOS 13 was first announced at WWDC</a>. Now that it’s finally here, we���re excited to share 1Password 7.4 for iOS with you.</p> \n<p>There���s a bunch of stuff I���m pumped to tell you about, so let���s dive in and take a look.</p> \n<h2 id=\"dark-mode-for-ios\">Dark Mode for iOS</h2> \n<img src=\"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/ios-fall-release/iOSdarkmode.png\" alt=\"Dark Mode on iOS 13\" title=\"Dark Mode on iOS 13\" style=\"max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;\" /> \n<p>Ever since Apple rolled out Dark Mode for macOS at WWDC 2018 I���ve been waiting for them to bring it to iOS. Whether I���m checking my emails first thing after waking up, or looking something up online before turning in for the night, being blasted in the face by a bright screen has never been a positive experience. Dark Mode on iOS solved this problem for me, though, and I couldn���t be happier. I���ve been using iOS 13 exclusively in Dark Mode for a while now, and I love it.</p> \n<p>We began the work to bring Dark Mode to 1Password for iOS in June and we���re really excited to show it off to you today.</p> \n<p>We’ve also added a special dark app icon that I think looks right at home in the dock on my iPhone.</p> \n<img src=\"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/ios-fall-release/iOSicon.png\" alt=\"Choose your 1Password icon\" title=\"Choose your 1Password icon\" style=\"max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;\" /> \n<h2 id=\"use-your-voice\">Use your voice</h2> \n<p>One of the most impressive and exciting parts of iOS 13 is the <a href=\"https://blog.1password.com/ios-voice-control-wwdc/\">addition of Voice Control</a>, and 1Password makes full use of it. This new feature opens up a world of possibility for users who may not have the ability to interact with their iOS device using their hands.</p> \n<p>With Voice Control you won���t have to lift a finger to search, open, edit, or share items from within 1Password. Control every aspect of your iOS device, including opening and navigating 1Password, just by using some simple, predictable voice commands.</p> \n<h2 id=\"documents-documents-documents\">Documents, documents, documents</h2> \n<img src=\"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/ios-fall-release/iOSdoc.png\" alt=\"Add your documents\" title=\"Add your documents\" style=\"max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;\" /> \n<p>Ever since we added the ability to create Documents using the camera roll, we have seen requests to expand our capabilities. Today, I���m pleased to say, we���re answering that feedback. Starting in 1Password 7.4 you can create Documents from the camera roll, use the camera directly, or pick a file from the Files app. That last one is particularly exciting as it means you’ll be able to bring in files from any app that makes its files available to the Files app ��� like Dropbox, Google Drive, and more.</p> \n<p>We���ve also added the ability to use the new document scanner in iOS 13 to create PDFs from your paperwork, complete with optical character recognition text summaries! It���s a fantastic way to scan and store your sensitive information securely and make it available to all your devices.</p> \n<h2 id=\"in-closing\">In closing</h2> \n<p>iOS 13 from Apple and 1Password 7.4 are both available today, so fire up your updaters and check out all the cool new features. While you wait, you can read our <a href=\"https://app-updates.agilebits.com/product_history/OPI4\">full set of release notes</a> or pop on over to the App Store and <a href=\"https://blog.1password.com/ios-fall-2019-release/itms-apps://itunes.apple.com/app/id568903335?action=write-review\">leave us a review</a>.</p> \n<p>Thank you to everyone who provided feedback about this release. 1Password wouldn���t be the app it is today without your involvement.

To see what all the fuss is about, I���ve been giving Brave a spin.</p>\n<h2 id=\"a-quick-introduction-to-brave\">A quick introduction to Brave</h2>\n<p>Developed by Brendan Eich, co-founder of Mozilla, Brave is a privacy-focused browser built on open-source Chromium.</p>\n<p>The backbone of Brave is the same as Chrome, so it shares a lot of its plus points: it has the same clean look, you can install extensions from the Chrome Store, and it syncs across devices. Brave supports Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS.</p>\n<h2 id=\"getting-started\">Getting started</h2>\n<p>Getting Brave set up is easy. When you launch the browser for the first time, a welcome tour helps you import any bookmarks and settings from your old browser.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/brave-test/1password-lock.png' alt='1Password X locked in Brave' title='1Password X locked in Brave' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>You can install <a href=\"https://support.1password.com/getting-started-1password-x/\">1Password X</a> straight from the Google Chrome Store. Remember, when you sign in to 1Password.com for the first time in Brave, you���ll need your Secret Key, <a href=\"https://support.1password.com/secret-key/\">so get that ready</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"minimizing-disruption\">Minimizing disruption</h2>\n<p>One of the reasons people stick with browsers like Chrome is their dependence on the browser���s password-saving feature. While convenient, browser password managers aren���t always the strongest choice when it comes to protecting your privacy. Tying your passwords to a particular browser makes it difficult to up and leave, too.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/brave-test/1password-autofill.png' alt='1Password X autofilling passwords in Brave' title='1Password X autofilling passwords in Brave' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>That���s where using a dedicated password manager makes a big difference. You can access all your passwords in any browser, so you���re not tied in.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1password-breaker-of-chains\">1Password, breaker of chains</h2>\n<p>Because 1Password is compatible with so many browsers, it���s easy to try something new without disrupting your workflow. If a browser isn���t the right fit, you can switch back without losing access to your data.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/brave-test/import-passwords.png' alt='Importing passwords to 1Password X' title='Importing passwords to 1Password X' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>I, of course, use 1Password. So when I tried Brave, all my passwords, credit cards and everything else were ready to use straight away. If you don&rsquo;t use 1Password already, it���s straightforward to import your passwords from <a href=\"https://support.1password.com/import-chrome/\">Chrome to 1Password</a>. Once you���ve done it, you���re free.</p>\n<h2 id=\"remember-browser-security-basics\">Remember browser security basics</h2>\n<p>After you set up 1Password in Brave, it���s worth familiarizing yourself with the browser���s security settings. Take a little time to get the basics set up:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Deselect the option to import browsing history and saved passwords during setup</li>\n<li>Either turn off cookies, cache, and browser history or clear them regularly</li>\n<li>Disable the in-browser password manager</li>\n<li>Disable Autofill</li>\n<li>Use incognito/private mode on public computers. You can set incognito/private mode as default in Brave too.</li>\n</ol>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/brave-test/brave-settings.png' alt='Brave security settings' title='Brave security settings' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<h2 id=\"whats-brave-like\">What���s Brave like?</h2>\n<p>Brave claims to be significantly faster than Safari or Chrome, and while I don���t have any independent data to back that up, it was certainly quick.</p>\n<p>There���s a whole host of privacy features to explore too. Built into the browser you���ll find ad and tracker shields, Tor integration, fingerprint blocking, HTTPS Everywhere, and more. Counters on the browser���s homepage add up how much time you���ve saved through blocking ads and trackers, which is a nice touch.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-verdict\">The verdict</h2>\n<p>Choosing a browser really comes down to personal preference. It���s a case of weighing up convenience with the features that matter to you.</p>\n<p>Brave looks and feels a lot like Chrome, so if you���re looking for a less intrusive alternative to Google���s browser, Brave might be right for you. It gives Firefox and Safari a run for their money when it comes to security, and it&rsquo;s far from slow.</p>\n<p>There���s a lot to like about Brave ��� its speed, focus on privacy, and built-in security features. And because I use 1Password, I could try it out easily without any interruption to my work.</p>\n<section class=\"c-call-to-action-box c-call-to-action-box--yellow c-call-to-action-box--background-author c-call-to-action-box--background-author-yellow\">\n<div class=\"c-call-to-action-box__author\">\n<img src=\"https://blog.1password.com/img/authors/emilymarchant.png\" class=\"c-call-to-action-box__author-image c-call-to-action-box__author-image--yellow\" alt=\"Emily Marchant\"/>\n</div>\n<div class=\"c-call-to-action-box__content\">\n<h3 class=\"c-call-to-action-box__title c-call-to-action-box__title--yellow\">Sign up for 30 days free!</h3>\n<div class=\"c-call-to-action-box__text c-call-to-action-box__text--yellow\">\nTo take 1Password X for a spin and see if it fits your workflow, sign up for a free 30-day trial of 1Password today.\n</div>\n<a href=\"https://1password.com/sign-up/?utm_source=blog/\" class=\"c-call-to-action-box__link-href c-call-to-action-box__link-href--stacked c-call-to-action-box__link-href--yellow\" data-on=\"click\" data-event-category=\"CTA\" data-event-action=\"call-to-action-button\">\nTry 1Password FREE\n</a>\n</div>\n</section>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 05 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":10468,"bgimg":"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/brave-test/header.png","linkMd5":"bee830ff7ad3aa297b14e344e5b4e878","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn94@2020_2/2020/08/25/00-54-53-204_f71bf3fdd666fae9.webp","destWidth":2080,"destHeight":800,"sourceBytes":29063,"destBytes":42198,"author":"Emily Marchant","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/brave-test/header.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn94@2020_2/2020/08/25/00-54-53-204_f71bf3fdd666fae9.webp","https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/brave-test/1password-lock.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn5@2020_1/2020/08/25/00-54-57-645_e7df66e1894cd55b.webp","https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/brave-test/1password-autofill.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn85@2020_1/2020/08/25/00-54-57-848_2e8d5a40c56db8d0.webp","https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/brave-test/import-passwords.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn79@2020_6/2020/08/25/00-55-04-425_033269d655053ecb.webp","https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/brave-test/brave-settings.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn16@2020_3/2020/08/25/00-55-04-787_9638faa2d278572b.webp","https://blog.1password.com/img/authors/emilymarchant.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn7@2020_1/2020/08/25/00-55-02-595_7b7ff396d27aba56.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598316891415},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:54:51","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:54:51","title":"Introducing the 1Password SCIM bridge","link":"https://blog.1password.com/scim-bridge-release/","description":"\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/scim-release/header.png' class='webfeedsFeaturedVisual' alt='Introducing the 1Password SCIM bridge' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p class=\"introduction\">I&rsquo;m thrilled to announce the first major release of the <a href=\"https://support.1password.com/scim/\">1Password SCIM bridge</a>! The SCIM bridge is the best way to automate provisioning of your team in 1Password Business.</p>\n<p>We&rsquo;ve spent the past year making it easier to roll out 1Password to your company. The 1Password SCIM bridge is available today, and it&rsquo;s compatible with the most popular enterprise identity providers: Azure Active Directory and Okta. It&rsquo;s available for one-click deployment on the Google Cloud Platform Marketplace, or it can be installed more traditionally using Docker, Kubernetes, or Terraform.</p>\n<p>The SCIM bridge makes it easy to manage your team because it brings 1Password into the workflows you already know and love. It allows you to control your 1Password account from your existing systems, so you can use the enterprise identity provider that your team is already familiar with. Your administrators can remain hands-off and manage your team from one central place to invite employees, grant them access to the correct groups, and deprovision them when they leave. Watch this video to see how the SCIM bridge syncs Okta with 1Password.</p>\n<div class=\"embed embed-16x9\">\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zo5oKsBjfVs\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe><br>\n</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>���At Okta, we securely connect our customers to the technologies they need for their businesses. We���re excited to partner with 1Password to do just that for our joint customers. With the 1Password SCIM bridge, 1Password customers leverage Okta���s full provisioning capabilities and can automate many common administrative tasks, enabling them to increase efficiency throughout their organizations.��� ��� <em>Chuck Fontana VP, Okta Integrations &amp; Strategic Partnerships</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To make sure everyone in your company can always access what they need, the SCIM bridge automatically syncs your identity provider���s groups with the groups in your 1Password account. Create <a href=\"https://support.1password.com/custom-groups/\">custom groups</a> in 1Password that you can manage directly from your identity provider to grant access to vaults.</p>\n<p>The SCIM bridge is designed with a robust and security-focused architecture. It runs within your cloud provider or existing infrastructure and connects to your identity provider using the industry-standard SCIM protocol.

While my Apple TV makes it easy to access the right streaming app to watch <em>Grey&rsquo;s Anatomy</em> or <em>Avengers: Endgame</em>, having to individually enter the passwords for each app can be frustrating.</p>\n<p>Whether it&rsquo;s fighting with the onscreen keyboard to painstakingly move between characters, or trying to speak clearly enough for Siri to understand, it&rsquo;s challenging to enter a suitably complex password correctly on first try. But with 1Password <a href=\"https://support.1password.com/get-the-apps/?ios\">set up on my iOS device</a>, I can take advantage of the AutoFill feature to access my stored credentials from my phone or iPad with just a tap.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-it-works\">How it works</h2>\n<p>AutoFill makes it easy to enter passwords on iOS without having to type out a full username and password. This makes it easier for me to use more complex generated passwords in places where I may not have before, keeping me more secure across all of my accounts.</p>\n<p>When I navigate to the username/password field for the app I want to use, my Apple TV automatically detects the login screen. A simple notification appears at the top of the screen, prompting me to use AutoFill on my iOS device to enter text or fill in a password.</p>\n<p>Tapping on that notification opens up the iOS keyboard where the 1Password account option is located in the QuickType bar just above the keyboard. If I have more than one login for a single app, I can easily tap the key icon on the right to scroll through and choose the right one.</p>\n<p>After I&rsquo;ve selected the right login credentials and authenticated using Touch ID, Face ID, or my Master Password, they&rsquo;re sent right over to my Apple TV.</p>\n<p>This simple process has saved me a headache while logging in to the right accounts for my streaming apps, getting me back to the drama, intrigue, and fictional mayhem that much faster.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-safe-is-it\">How safe is it?</h2>\n<p>AutoFill keeps my credentials as safe as possible and never displays my username or password in plain text on my iPhone, iPad, or Apple TV. Even if I&rsquo;m signing in to an app in a room full of people ready for movie night, my passwords are still secret and kept safely locked in my 1Password vault.</p>\n<p>And if I want to add an extra level of security, AutoFill also works with two-factor authentication codes. The code can be entered using the same processes used for other credentials stored in your 1Password vault.</p>\n<section class=\"c-call-to-action-box c-call-to-action-box--background-author\">\n<div class=\"c-call-to-action-box__author\">\n<img src=\"https://blog.1password.com/img/authors/sarahbrown.jpg\" class=\"c-call-to-action-box__author-image\" alt=\"Sarah Brown\"/>\n</div>\n<div class=\"c-call-to-action-box__content\">\n<h3 class=\"c-call-to-action-box__title\">Sign up for 30 days free!</h3>\n<div class=\"c-call-to-action-box__text\">\nSignup for 1Password today and get your first 30 days free.\n</div>\n<a href=\"https://1password.com/sign-up/\" class=\"c-call-to-action-box__link-href c-call-to-action-box__link-href--stacked\" data-on=\"click\" data-event-category=\"CTA\" data-event-action=\"call-to-action-button\">\nTry 1Password FREE\n</a>\n</div>\n</section>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 19 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":10468,"bgimg":"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2020/autofill-apple-tv/header.png","linkMd5":"a081a163e767c83b2fe6df5f589b6086","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn90@2020_2/2020/08/25/00-54-54-263_4f6759e6e73a20f6.webp","destWidth":2080,"destHeight":800,"sourceBytes":30527,"destBytes":22610,"author":"Sarah Brown","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2020/autofill-apple-tv/header.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn90@2020_2/2020/08/25/00-54-54-263_4f6759e6e73a20f6.webp","https://blog.1password.com/img/authors/sarahbrown.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn63@2020_5/2020/08/25/00-55-08-297_4fbf004afcdefa0c.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598316891413},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:54:51","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:54:51","title":"Improve your team���s security in 2019 with our next webinar","link":"https://blog.1password.com/improve-your-teams-security-in-2019-with-our-next-webinar/","description":"\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/admin-webinar/header.png' class='webfeedsFeaturedVisual' alt='Improve your team���s security in 2019 with our next webinar' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p class=\"introduction\">Start 2019 with the goal of improving your team&rsquo;s security habits.

And why shouldn���t that apply to authentication factors? You have your Master Password and Secret Key, and they���re combined to be one amazingly strong factor via <a href=\"https://blog.agilebits.com/2018/02/14/how-we-use-srp-and-you-can-too/\">Secure Remote Password</a>. We���ve added two more to the guest list, and you get to invite whichever you���d like.</p>\n<h2 id=\"two-factor-authentication\">Two-Factor Authentication</h2>\n<p>Two-factor authentication in 1Password is implemented with Time-based One-Time Passwords. Time-based One-Time Passwords is a mouthful, so forgive me for abbreviating it to TOTP from here on out. TOTP is a widely adopted standard and it���s a great way of adding a familiar additional factor to your authentication process.</p>\n<p>When setting up two-factor authentication, you���ll be provided with a TOTP secret that you can store in an authenticator app of your choosing. 1Password has been a TOTP authenticator for years now and storing it there is very convenient, but we recommend also storing it in an authenticator app like <a href=\"https://authy.com/\">Authy</a>. Ideally you���d store it in both so you have access to it when needed. When it comes to backups, the more the merrier, just like Mom said! ����</p>\n<p>Any time you sign in to your account from a new device you���ll be prompted for a one-time password. Use the authenticator app to get the current one-time password, punch it in and you���re off to the races.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/mfa/two-factor.png' alt='1Password Two Factor Authentication page' title='1Password Two Factor Authentication page' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p><a href=\"https://support.1password.com/two-factor-authentication/\">Turning on two-factor authentication is a breeze</a>. All you need to do is go to <a href=\"https://start.1password.com/profile\">My Profile</a>, choose ���More Actions��� on the action bar on the left, then ���Turn On Two-Factor Authentication���. From there instructions will have you set up in no time. Just make sure that you keep your TOTP secret safe as it���s going to be required any time you sign in from a new device.</p>\n<h2 id=\"duo-security\">Duo Security</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://duo.com/\">Duo Security</a> is a slightly different approach to protecting accounts and has been available as a beta feature in 1Password for a number of months. The feedback we���ve gotten from it has been unanimously positive, and Duo is now available for anyone using 1Password Teams or 1Password Business. The best part of Duo is that once configured by an administrator it will automatically apply to all members of the team.</p>\n<p>When you sign in to 1Password, you���ll be prompted to send a push notification to your mobile device where you can either allow or deny the request to sign in.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/mfa/duo-mac.png' alt='Duo &#43; 1Password for Mac' title='Duo &#43; 1Password for Mac' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>Duo is a great option if you���re looking to enforce the use of an additional factor across a whole team.</p>\n<h2 id=\"another-layer-of-protection\">Another Layer of Protection</h2>\n<p>The awesome part about these additional factors during authentication is that they get to stand on the shoulders of Secure Remote Password. The SRP handshake needs to occur and all additional factor requests get the benefits of that secure channel. Without SRP the same attacks that could disclose your password to an attacker eavesdropping on a connection could also disclose your additional authentication factor. SRP protects both your password and the additional factor. This also means that enabling two-factor authentication or Duo does not mean that you can have a weaker Master Password. They protect against very different things, and your Master Password is ultimately what���s protecting your data.</p>\n<h2 id=\"supported-across-all-1password-apps\">Supported Across All 1Password Apps</h2>\n<p>We���ve rolled out support for both Duo and TOTP in all of our apps. Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, Web, and Chrome. We���ve even added both to our <a href=\"https://1password.com/downloads/command-line/\">1Password CLI tool</a>, and it���s pretty amazing to have a terminal emulator trigger a push notification to my iPhone. Just make sure that you���re using the latest versions of our apps and you���ll be set.</p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 25 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":10468,"bgimg":"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/mfa/header.png","linkMd5":"8d840ffca3f612ed1ab757c9eca1c352","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn46@2020_6/2020/08/25/00-54-55-532_b9758f08d36bb49f.webp","destWidth":1030,"destHeight":515,"sourceBytes":103394,"destBytes":9846,"author":"Rick Fillion","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/mfa/header.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn46@2020_6/2020/08/25/00-54-55-532_b9758f08d36bb49f.webp","https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/mfa/two-factor.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn91@2020_3/2020/08/25/00-55-07-422_f8f0b41a8f933312.webp","https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/mfa/duo-mac.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn22@2020_1/2020/08/25/00-54-58-860_3d5519be9ec56c2a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598316891418},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:54:51","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:54:51","title":"The iOS clipboard conundrum","link":"https://blog.1password.com/clipboard-conundrum/","description":"\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2020/ios-clipboard-conundrum/header.png' class='webfeedsFeaturedVisual' alt='The iOS clipboard conundrum' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<section class=\"c-call-to-action-box c-call-to-action-box--yellow\">\n<div class=\"c-call-to-action-box__content\">\n<h3 class=\"c-call-to-action-box__title c-call-to-action-box__title--yellow\">Correction</h3>\n<div class=\"c-call-to-action-box__text c-call-to-action-box__text--yellow\">\n<p>After this article was published on June 30, 2020, it was pointed out by a keen-eyed user (thank you!) that 1Password for iOS 7.6 does still copy to the clipboard automatically (without your consent) at certain times.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When you edit a Login item, the new password is copied to the clipboard.</li>\n<li>When you create a new Login item, the new password is copied to the clipboard.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These automatic behaviors will cease with the <em>next</em> release ��� 1Password for iOS 7.6.1. My sincerest apologies for the error and any confusion it has caused.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</section>\n<p>It was back in March when researchers discovered that a popular video-sharing service was accessing users&rsquo; iOS clipboard contents without permission. Apple vowed to address the problem.</p>\n<p>At last week&rsquo;s WWDC 2020, Apple made good on their promise with the release of the iOS 14 developer beta which, among other great security enhancements, notifies you when an application accesses your clipboard.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s now been revealed that a number of other apps (53, to be precise) access the iOS clipboard without consent.</p>\n<p>This has sparked a lot of conversation, questions, and concern from our customers, and I&rsquo;d love the chance to address the issue.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-this-means\">What this means</h2>\n<p>It&rsquo;s important to remember that nothing has really changed ��� this clipboard &ldquo;scraping&rdquo; has happened for some time. The only difference is that, with the release of iOS 14, you&rsquo;ll <em>know</em> when it happens. And knowledge is power. Now that companies have been (and will be) called out for their behavior, those with legitimate business models will be far less likely to engage in such practices.</p>\n<p>Now, I know why you&rsquo;re really here, so let&rsquo;s get to the goods.</p>\n<p>First, <strong>1Password never copies data to the clipboard without a specific request from you.</strong> In other words, your secure 1Password data will never make it to the clipboard unless you tap Copy, or have Auto-Copy One-Time Passwords turned on.</p>\n<p>What&rsquo;s more, when you fill 1Password items on an iOS device, 1Password uses the <a href=\"https://support.1password.com/ios-autofill/#set-up-autofill\">Password AutoFill</a> service, which is built into the framework of iOS. Password AutoFill allows the system itself to pull data from 1Password so there is no interaction with the clipboard (except to copy one-time passwords, when necessary).</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-you-can-do\">What you can do</h2>\n<p>If you haven&rsquo;t yet <a href=\"https://support.1password.com/ios-autofill/#set-up-autofill\">set up AutoFill</a> on your iOS device (and this post has been wholly confusing thus far), that&rsquo;s my first recommendation.</p>\n<p>If you already use 1Password via AutoFill, and you want extra insurance for the odd time you need to copy and paste, turn on Clear Clipboard in 1Password Security settings. That will clear your iOS clipboard of any 1Password data ninety seconds after it&rsquo;s copied.</p>\n<p>You can learn even more about <a href=\"https://support.1password.com/ios-autofill-security/\">1Password AutoFill security</a> on the 1Password Support website.</p>\n<h2 id=\"in-the-end\">In the end</h2>\n<p>We love that Apple has remained committed to its stance on user privacy, which it called a &ldquo;fundamental human right&rdquo;. We certainly don&rsquo;t disagree.</p>\n<p>1Password will remain committed to our foundation - your <a href=\"https://1password.com/security/\">security</a>. Part of that commitment is constant development, which does include ways to further reduce the need for people to copy passwords (and other secrets) to the clipboard. We have a staunch belief that you - and only you - should be in control of your information. &ldquo;Private by design&rdquo; is not just marketing-speak ��� it&rsquo;s how 1Password was built, and how it will stay.</p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 30 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":10468,"bgimg":"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2020/ios-clipboard-conundrum/header.png","linkMd5":"df8eb5c5912e89b5aee97367f3319b87","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn50@2020_4/2020/08/25/00-54-55-815_a664ebe3a2c681bd.webp","destWidth":2080,"destHeight":800,"sourceBytes":53980,"destBytes":58494,"author":"Megan Barker","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2020/ios-clipboard-conundrum/header.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn50@2020_4/2020/08/25/00-54-55-815_a664ebe3a2c681bd.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598316891413},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:54:51","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:54:51","title":"Yubico���s Stina Ehrensv��rd on security keys and second layers","link":"https://blog.1password.com/interview-with-stina-ehrensvard/","description":"\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2020/rbm-yubico-interview/header.png' class='webfeedsFeaturedVisual' alt='Yubico���s Stina Ehrensv��rd on security keys and second layers' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p class=\"introduction\">We&rsquo;re kicking off the new year on our podcast, Random but Memorable, by <a href=\"https://randombutmemorable.simplecast.com/episodes/lego-llama-web-standard\">talking with Stina Ehrensv��rd</a>, co-founder and CEO of <a href=\"https://www.yubico.com/\">Yubico</a>. Stina started the company in 2007 with her husband, a former white hat hacker, after realizing just how easy it would have been to hack her bank account.</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re wondering how a security key or other external two-factor authentication (2FA) device could benefit you or your business, read on to learn more.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-a-security-key\">What is a security key?</h2>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://blog.1password.com/introducing-support-for-u2f-security-keys/\">security key</a> is a small physical device that adds a second layer of protection to your online accounts. When two-factor authentication is turned on for your accounts, you are prompted to use your second factor any time you sign in from a new device. A small security key like Yubico&rsquo;s YubiKey fits in your pocket. It can be used as an extra layer of protection on 1Password, Google, macOS, Firefox, and more.</p>\n<p>Support for these keys is built in to most web browsers via Yubico���s new <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/05/webauthn\">WebAuthn API</a>, creating what Stina calls ���the seatbelt for the internet.��� WebAuthn is backward-compatible with Universal 2nd Factor (U2F), so any certified U2F security keys will work with the WebAuthn-enabled flow. We&rsquo;re excited to be included alongside Google and GitHub to be some of the first to adopt the new browser standard developed by Yubico.</p>\n<h2 id=\"does-a-security-key-replace-my-passwords\">Does a security key replace my passwords?</h2>\n<p>Although a security key provides extra protection, it doesn&rsquo;t eliminate the need for passwords. Passwords are still the industry standard for online accounts, and that isn&rsquo;t changing anytime soon. Security keys, like biometric authentication, work with your strong, unique passwords to protect your account against hackers. However, biometric authentication like Face ID and fingerprints operate within a margin of error.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;What I like about using YubiKey and a password or PIN, is that it&rsquo;s exact. It&rsquo;s 100% or nothing,��� says Stina.</p>\n<p>This dual setup provides a higher level of hardware-based security by allowing you to use the same security key across multiple services, browsers, and applications. Although combining a password manager with a security key provides the best protection, adding a second factor doesn&rsquo;t mean you can get away with a weaker Master Password or reusing the same password across multiple sites. <a href=\"https://blog.1password.com/how-to-protect-yourself-from-password-reuse-attacks/\">Password reuse</a>, or using the same password for multiple accounts, leaves you vulnerable to hackers and account lockouts. That&rsquo;s why your Master Password, which is used for the encryption of your data, is still instrumental in protecting your 1Password account.</p>\n<h2 id=\"who-needs-an-external-authenticator\">Who needs an external authenticator?</h2>\n<p>If you or your business has dealt with the fallout of a breach or hack, you know how much trouble it causes. Adding an external authentication factor gives you peace of mind that your accounts are protected. Apps like Google Authenticator use your phone to add this second layer by prompting you to open the app and type out the six-digit code.</p>\n<p>However, using your phone as your single authenticator and login method only works if you always have your phone on hand. It can pose a problem if you���re not allowed to bring a phone on-site, or if it���s ever lost or stolen. Using a security key instead of an app allows you to access your accounts without needing your phone. ���I���m not advocating that hardware is the solution for everything, but if you want good security, it���s proven to work,��� says Stina.</p>\n<p>Using a password manager and combining it with a physical security key like YubiKey eliminates the chances of being hacked remotely, giving you peace of mind when it comes to the safety of your data.</p>\n<p>���The internet was not designed for security, it was designed for sharing,&rdquo; Stina explains. This is the problem that inspired Yubico���s mission, which is to develop a standard that will help every person on the planet to be more secure.</p>\n<p>If you���re interested in learning more about how a security key could protect you, <a href=\"https://randombutmemorable.simplecast.com/episodes/lego-llama-web-standard\">listen to this week���s podcast</a>.

I always look forward to this event because it showcases the latest and greatest technologies coming to Google���s platforms. And to make things even better, I was joined by Gene, Peri, Shiner and Michael ��� our largest group at I/O yet!</p>\n<h2 id=\"google-io-2018\">Google I/O 2018</h2>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/google-io/team.jpg' alt='Team photo at Google I/O 2018' title='Team photo at Google I/O 2018' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>After grabbing coffee and snacks, we took our seats and eagerly waited for the keynote to begin. Sundar Pichai opened the conference by revisiting the most pressing issue of last year: the hamburger and beer emoji fiasco! With the cheese now in the right place, he continued with the keynote and introduced one of the main themes of the conference: leveraging machine learning to solve both simple and complex problems in our daily lives.</p>\n<p>The improvements to the Google Assistant such as ���continued conversations��� and the new voices are fantastic. I do worry that I may fall back asleep if John Legend���s soothing voice reads my daily briefing each morning! The Duplex demo was just incredible and I am amazed at how the Assistant was able to understand and deliver natural language conversations over the phone. I���ve shown the video to all of my family members��� maybe even scared them a bit. But don���t worry mom, I promise it will be the real me calling. ����</p>\n<h2 id=\"android-p-popsicle\">Android P (Popsicle?)</h2>\n<p>It wouldn���t be Google I/O without a strong focus on the next version of Android. Immediately after they announced the Android P beta, I installed it on my Pixel 2 XL and revelled in the beautiful controls, typography, and roundedness of its design. Android P is all about intelligently analyzing and adapting to our usage patterns. This is being used to drive powerful features such as the new Digital Wellbeing. I���m looking forward to using it to remind me to disconnect and focus on the real world sometimes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"developing-on-a-pixelbook\">Developing on a Pixelbook</h2>\n<p>One pleasant surprise that got Michael very excited was the announcement that Android Studio is coming to Chrome OS. He quickly got it running on his Pixelbook and then challenged me to a race to see who could build 1Password faster. We were both shocked to find that his Pixelbook came in only 7 seconds behind my MacBook Pro. That���s pretty impressive!</p>\n<div class=\"tweet\">\n<img src=\"https://blog.1password.com/img/icons/twitter.svg\" alt=\"@michaelverde tweet\" />\n<p>\nThe <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/chromeos?src=hash\">#chromeos</a> team gave us an awesome present at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/io18?src=hash\">#io18</a> this year.

At 1Password, we understand the challenges all too well ��� we���ve been an almost entirely remote workforce for 14 years, and have learned a lot along the way.</p>\n<p>The good news is going remote could actually make your teams <a href=\"https://lp.buffer.com/state-of-remote-work-2020\">happier</a> and <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/marcel-schwantes/new-study-reveals-why-working-from-home-makes-workers-more-productive.html\">more productive</a> if you get it right. If your team needs to work from home or you���re considering trying it out for your business, here are our top tips for getting started.</p>\n<h2 id=\"communicate-communicate-communicate\">Communicate, communicate, communicate</h2>\n<p>Keeping communication open and collaboration going can be one of the biggest challenges of working from home ��� loneliness can creep in and teams can begin to feel siloed. Luckily, some great tools that make collaborating remotely a lot easier. Here are a few of our favorites:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Slack.</strong> Our go-to tool for everyday collaboration. Channels are a great place to work on projects together ��� there���s a record of everything so you can always pick up where you left off. Instant messaging means you can get hold of someone for a quick opinion when you need to. It���s also great for community building: we have channels dedicated to watercooler chat, mental health, giving kudos to other team members for great work, and all sorts of hobbies and interests.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Google Meet.</strong> Perfect for those moments when you just need to be in a room together and great for daily stand-ups or bigger project catch-ups. Just start a call or video chat when you&rsquo;d usually head into a meeting room.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Basecamp.</strong> For long-term and ongoing projects, Basecamp is ideal. Everything related to each project is in one place ��� meeting notes, relevant documents, and ongoing conversations ��� so we always have the full picture. We can see exactly what each other is working on and pitch in if we need to.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>1Password.</strong> Managing access when you&rsquo;re remote can be tricky. We learned that from doing it for over a decade, and so we built 1Password Business to give people access to the tools they need (and only the tools they need) to work.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We also manage projects and development in GitLab, hand off and discuss design files in Zeplin, handle HR using Humi, and manage a whole host of internal processes using some other impressive tools. You���ll find your own setup, but for every communication pain point, there���s a solution out there.</p>\n<h2 id=\"set-expectations-from-the-start\">Set expectations from the start</h2>\n<p>What you expect from your teams will depend highly on the type of business you run. Your customer service teams may need to be available between specific hours, for example, whereas design might be able to pick up a project any time of day. Whatever your expectations: communicate them clearly from the start and make sure that everyone fully understands the rules by which you&rsquo;re now working. Here are a few things you might want to think about:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Working hours.</strong> Make sure people know if their schedule needs to stay the same, or whether it can be more flexible when working from home.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Availability.</strong> If you need to know when your teams are present, make sure you have a process in place for communicating that they���re away from their desks. Slack is really useful here ��� you can set a status letting everyone know that you���re at lunch, in a meeting, or taking a trip to the doctors.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Processes and priorities.</strong> Some types of work may be possible from home, while others might not ��� you may need to review some of your processes and priorities and adapt them to home working. Make sure you communicate any changes to your teams.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"prioritise-wellbeing\">Prioritise wellbeing</h2>\n<p>Maintaining your teams��� <a href=\"https://blog.1password.com/remote-work-mental-health/\">happiness and work-life balance</a> is just as important as laying the structural groundwork for remote working. <a href=\"https://lp.buffer.com/state-of-remote-work-2020\">Difficulty unplugging</a> is one of the top struggles of remote workers, so make sure to encourage people to take proper breaks and time away from their desks ��� and actually mean it. There are also lots of ways workers can help themselves.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Dedicate a space to work.</strong> If you have a spare room to use as an office, ideal. I swear by having a separate room to work. But if that���s not possible, use a small desk in another room, your kitchen table, or coworking space. It can be tempting to work from the sofa or bed, but when professional and personal space overlap, it can be difficult to switch off.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Think about how you use devices.</strong> Ideally, you���ll have two devices: one for work and one for home. If that���s not possible, using your laptop with a monitor and keyboard, rather than in your lap, can serve as a mental cue to separate work and personal time. Partitioning your hard drive and creating a separate user account for work is a good idea too.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Dress for work.</strong> We���re not talking full suit and tie here, but wearing comfy but presentable clothes, rather than tatty pajamas, can help with focus. It also means you���re ready to nip out to get some fresh air. Our COO wears shoes at his desk, it helps put him in the right mindset for work.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Stick to a regular schedule.</strong> Even if working from home means you can be flexible with your time, setting your own hours and sticking to them helps maintain work-life balance and mentally untangle at the end of the day.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Get up and move.</strong> Without the walk to the station or stroll at lunch, it���s easy to become sedentary when working from home. Walk around while you���re on a call, take the dog for a walk, pop to the shops, or make time for the gym ��� whatever works for you. At 1Password, we offer everyone an allowance to spend on healthy activities away from their keyboard; whether that���s a yoga class, monthly kayaking trip, or a subscription for a meditation app. The choice is theirs.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"secure-your-setup\">Secure your setup</h2>\n<p>When people work from home, it inevitably <a href=\"https://blog.1password.com/remote-work-security-people/\">brings new security considerations</a>. Every worker needs to know exactly what to do to <a href=\"https://blog.1password.com/remote-work-security-tips/\">remain safe online</a> while working from home, and it���s your responsibility to make that happen. Here���s a quick checklist to help you get started:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Work should only be done on trusted devices. No working from the public library or on a friend���s computer. If possible, encourage workers to have separate work and personal devices.</li>\n<li>Home routers should not use default passwords, and should be checked for firmware updates annually.</li>\n<li>All desktops and laptops should make use of full disk encryption.</li>\n<li>As general practice, minimize the storage of customer/sensitive data on local devices. Encourage team members to regularly check what they���re storing and give their device a regular purge of non-essential data.</li>\n<li>Use <a href=\"https://1password.com/business/\">1Password</a> to securely share all the company���s important info and logins with remote workers.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trust-your-teams-and-reap-the-rewards\">Trust your teams and reap the rewards</h2>\n<p>Remember, working from home may take a little time to get used to. There are new ways of working and communicating for everyone to get to grips with.</p>\n<p>Be present and check in with your team regularly, but trust that your employees will continue to excel, even from their kitchen table.

Let���s take a look at what you get with the latest and greatest version of 1Password.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/never-better-time-upgrade-7/Mini.png' alt='1Password Mini' title='1Password Mini' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<h2 id=\"1password-mini\">1Password mini</h2>\n<p>1Password mini has a beautiful new design in 1Password 7. Every pixel has been reimagined to give you more information and control, so you can keep all your passwords, credit cards, and other important items right at your fingertips. It still works in your favorite browsers, and now you can fill in apps with drag and drop. The new 1Password mini is available in 1Password 7 for both <a href=\"https://support.1password.com/upgrade-mac/\">Mac</a> and <a href=\"https://support.1password.com/upgrade-windows/\">Windows</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"watchtower-and-security\">Watchtower and security</h2>\n<p>Data breaches happen all the time. If you use 1Password 7, <a href=\"https://watchtower.1password.com/\">Watchtower</a> alerts you if any of your passwords have been compromised and need to be changed. It also keeps track of expiring items (like credit cards or passports) and warns you of unsecured websites.</p>\n<p>Watchtower now integrates with <a href=\"https://twofactorauth.org/\">twofactorauth.org</a>, so you&rsquo;ll know when you aren&rsquo;t using two-factor authentication on a site that supports it.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/never-better-time-upgrade-7/Watchtower.png' alt='1Password 7 Watchtower' title='1Password 7 Watchtower' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<h2 id=\"dark-mode\">Dark Mode</h2>\n<p>1Password 7 for Mac supports Dark Mode, and because 1Password 7 populates icons to make it easy to find the login you���re looking for, you���re in for a real treat. The colorful icons really pop against the dark background. You can download the latest version of <a href=\"https://support.1password.com/upgrade-mac/\">1Password for Mac</a> now.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/never-better-time-upgrade-7/Sidebar.png' alt='1Password 7 sidebar' title='1Password 7 sidebar' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<h2 id=\"preparing-for-safari-13\">Preparing for Safari 13</h2>\n<p>If you���re still using 1Password 6 with Safari, you���ll need to either upgrade to 1Password 7 <a href=\"https://blog.1password.com/safari-13-is-awesome-upgrade-from-1password-6/\">before macOS Catalina comes out later this year</a> or switch to another browser. Regardless, there���s a lot to love about the latest and greatest 1Password release. <a href=\"https://support.1password.com/upgrade-mac/\">Learn more about upgrading.</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"faster-and-more-streamlined\">Faster and more streamlined</h2>\n<p>In 1Password 7, both the Windows and Mac apps were completely rebuilt to give you the most powerful and streamlined 1Password experience ever.

From customized keyboard shortcuts to support for nested tags, you can make 1Password 7 work the way you need it to.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/never-better-time-upgrade-7/upgradenow.png' alt='Upgrade to 1Password 7' title='Upgrade to 1Password 7' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<h2 id=\"upgrade-now\">Upgrade now</h2>\n<p>If you have a 1Password membership, 1Password 7 is included in your subscription.

Given that it was such a significant departure from its predecessor, we anticipated this feedback. Instead of snapping into reaction mode, we took a wait-and-see approach; change is hard, and we didn&rsquo;t want to jump to the wrong conclusions. Over time, we built up a wish list of improvements we wanted to bring to 1Password mini and we set off on our journey.</p>\n<h2 id=\"core-competencies\">Core competencies</h2>\n<p>Before a single mockup or wireframe was created, we took a step back to define exactly what 1Password mini needed to do well:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Show items that match the frontmost app or website</li>\n<li>Fill your passwords, credit cards, and address information into a web page</li>\n<li>Generate new passwords quickly and easily</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The mini&rsquo;s primary goal is to get your information out of 1Password and into the places where you need it with a strong focus on filling your passwords, credit cards, and address information into web pages. Additionally, it needs to be clear how to perform every action.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Mini is for filling&rdquo; quickly became our mantra during this redesign, and each decision was made in service of that mission.</p>\n<p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/opm73/evernote-light.png' alt='Easy to find AutoFill - Light mode' title='Easy to find AutoFill - Light mode' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/opm73/evernote-dark.png' alt='Easy to find AutoFill - Dark mode' title='Easy to find AutoFill - Dark mode' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n</p>\n<p>A big piece of what makes 1Password mini successful when it comes to filling your information is our &ldquo;filling brain&rdquo;. Powered by machine learning that takes place locally on your device, 1Password analyzes the web page and suggests the items you&rsquo;re most likely to need on that page. What this means is that when you&rsquo;re on a shopping cart page buying that bespoke artisanal handmade teak wood lute, 1Password mini will have your credit cards ready and waiting for you.</p>\n<h2 id=\"complex-passwords-made-easy\">Complex passwords made easy</h2>\n<p>Using a strong, unique password for every account is the best thing you can do for your personal internet hygiene. 1Password mini makes creating these passwords incredibly easy. Simply hit the New Password button, adjust the length of the password as needed, and save &amp; copy the password.</p>\n<p>To get back to your previously generated passwords, just click the menu button above the item list and select <strong>Passwords</strong>. All of your passwords are there, conveniently sorted in reverse chronological order:</p>\n<p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/opm73/save-copy-light.png' alt='Strong new passwords - light mode' title='Strong new passwords - light mode' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/opm73/save-copy-dark.png' alt='Strong new passwords - dark mode' title='Strong new passwords - dark mode' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n</p>\n<h2 id=\"speedy-search\">Speedy search</h2>\n<p>While filling into web pages and creating new passwords might be what you do the most, all your items are available in 1Password mini, and they&rsquo;re only a keystroke away.

It���s WWDC week and a large portion of the 1Password development team is here in San Jose basking in the glow of this year���s Apple���s Worldwide Developer Conference. For me it���s my first time coming to WWDC since it was last held in San Francisco two years ago, and I absolutely love it. The conference center itself is gorgeous, and the surrounding area is wonderful. Somehow I���m finding it easier to run into folks I know, and I���ve already caught up with a bunch of old friends and made a number of new ones since I���ve arrived.</p>\n<p>WWDC is much more than a place for me to stretch the wings of my social butterfly tendencies, however; it���s all about new tech, and boy oh boy did Apple hook us up this year. Many of us are already rocking iOS 12 and macOS Mojave on our main devices and computers and they are awesome. Not only that, but 1Password is running quite happily on iOS 12 and needs just a couple small tweaks on macOS Mojave.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ios-12-and-password-autofill\">iOS 12 and Password Autofill</h2>\n<p>On Monday afternoon, during Apple���s Platform State of the Union I sat down with my teammate Rudy and jumped into Apple���s newly announced Password Autofill API. By the time we were ready to grab some dinner we had a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/1Password/status/1003824297725460481\">tweet-worthy</a> demo all done:</p>\n<div class=\"tweet\">\n<img src=\"https://blog.1password.com/img/icons/twitter.svg\" alt=\"@1Password tweet\" />\n<p>\nWhat a wonderful present for us at WWDC this year! Thank you to all our friends at Apple for this great new API. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/1PasswordAutofill?src=hash\">#1PasswordAutofill</a> - <span>@1Password</span>\n<a href=\"http://twitter.com/user/status/1003824297725460481\" title=\"@1Password\" class=\"view-tweet\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">View tweet</a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p>This new capability is transformational in our ability to integrate with iOS. Starting in the next version of iOS, 1Password will be able to fill your credentials into every app that has opted into the <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2017/206/\">Password Autofill functionality</a> that Apple introduced with iOS 11 last year.\n���</p>\n<h2 id=\"macos-mojave-and-dark-mode\">macOS Mojave and Dark Mode</h2>\n<p>After our incredibly successful launch of 1Password 7 a few weeks ago we���ve been waiting to see what Apple had in store for the Mac. On Monday we got our first glimpse of dark mode in macOS Mojave, which of course left our designer Dan itching to get back to his computer to start playing. Since then the mockups have been flowing like water:</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/wwdc18/opm7-dark.png' alt='Locked 1Password 7 for Mac in dark mode' title='Locked 1Password 7 for Mac in dark mode' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<h2 id=\"privacy-and-security\">Privacy and Security</h2>\n<p>Apple���s dedication to privacy and security are legendary and this year they introduced a whole host of new tools to help keep your computer safe. The biggest ones that we���re excited about are system integrity protection (SIP) for apps and notarized apps.</p>\n<p>Apple���s documentation gives a concise definition of SIP at a high level:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>System Integrity Protection is a security technology in OS X El Capitan and later that���s designed to help prevent potentially malicious software from modifying protected files and folders on your Mac.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>SIP for apps allows us to opt in to these same protections for the 1Password app binary that resides on your computer. It gives you (and us!) peace of mind knowing that the app we built and shipped is the one running on your computer.</p>\n<p>Notarized apps is the other thing that we���re really excited about. Apple is standing up a new service for developers where they can submit their app prior to release. The service will check the app, verify that it���s free of malware, and issue a certificate that will be ���stapled��� to the app. This certificate is then used by your Mac to verify that the version of 1Password you���re using has been screened and approved as being free of malware. Coupled with SIP, these two new technologies are going to be great for all apps, and 1Password in particular.</p>\n<h2 id=\"wrapping-it-up\">Wrapping it Up</h2>\n<p>While I can���t comment on rumor or speculation, you could use our previous track record to reasonably conclude that when iOS 12 and macOS Mojave ship later this year we���ll be there, on day one, with full support for both. In the meantime, make sure you <a href=\"https://agilemail.createsend.com/h/r/D0EB73D97DBAC94E\">sign up for the iOS beta</a>, and opt-in to the betas of 1Password for Mac in Preferences:\n���</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/wwdc18/opm7-beta-preferences.png' alt='Locked 1Password 7 for Mac in dark mode' title='Locked 1Password 7 for Mac in dark mode' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>How about you?

The sidebar shows more information than ever, but the dark theme and monochrome icons allow you to focus your attention on what matters most: <em>your items</em>.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/opm7.0-beta/main-window.png' alt='1Password main window while unlocked' title='1Password main window while unlocked' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<h3 id=\"drag-and-drop\">Drag and drop</h3>\n<p>You can now see all your vaults in the sidebar. This makes it easy to drag and drop items between vaults to organize them. You can even drag them between two different accounts. And if you drag items onto New Vault, a vault will be created for you right there and then. It���s never been easier to share and organize your information.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/opm7.0-beta/sidebar-vaults.png' alt='1Password sidebar with vaults revealed' title='1Password sidebar with vaults revealed' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<h3 id=\"easily-edit-vaults\">Easily edit vaults</h3>\n<p>With the new sidebar it seemed fitting to allow you to manage your vaults directly from there. So that���s what we did. Edit vault names, change their descriptions, choose an avatar or upload your own. All without ever leaving 1Password.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/opm7.0-beta/edit-vaults.png' alt='Edit vault window' title='Edit vault window' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<h3 id=\"rich-formatting-in-notes\">Rich formatting in notes</h3>\n<p>Are you feeling <strong>bold</strong>? How about <em>emphatic</em>? You can now express your emotions in secure notes. Use Markdown in any of your notes to add clickable links, ordered and unordered lists, and eye catching styles.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/opm7.0-beta/rich-formatting.png' alt='A Secure Note with richly formatted text' title='A Secure Note with richly formatted text' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<h3 id=\"nested-tags\">Nested tags</h3>\n<p>Tag fanatics rejoice!

There���s an Inception joke here somewhere; while you wait for me to find it, add a forward slash to your tag names and 1Password will do the rest.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/opm7.0-beta/nested-tags.png' alt='Sidebar with nested tags showing' title='Sidebar with nested tags showing' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<h3 id=\"pop-out-items\">Pop-out items</h3>\n<p>If you use lots of different apps on your Mac or enjoy viewing multiple items at once, you���re going to love this: click the <img src=\"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/opm7.0/inline-pop-out-icon.png\" alt=\"Pop out toolbar icon\"> icon on the toolbar and your item details are whisked away into a new sticky window that will stick around until you dismiss it.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/opm7.0-beta/popout-items.png' alt='A separate window showing an iTunes login' title='A separate window showing an iTunes login' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<h3 id=\"our-own-font-courier-prime-bits\">Our own font: Courier Prime Bits</h3>\n<p>No design is ever complete without finding the perfect font.

September brings some of our <em>biggest</em> features yet����� and we mean that literally.</p> \n<h3 id=\"large-type\">Large Type</h3> \n<p>Large Type is a beloved feature in the 1Password apps, and it’s made its way to 1Password X in style. Now you can make any of your passwords big and bold, so they’re easy to copy and read. Beautiful, eh?? <img src=\"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/b5x1.10/large-type.png\" alt=\"Large Type for a generated password\" title=\"Large Type for a generated password\" style=\"max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;\" /> </p> \n<h3 id=\"watchtower\">Watchtower</h3> \n<p>Watchtower helps you proactively identify breached passwords, so you can update them and stay secure. The Watchtower interface was completely redesigned for 1Password 7 for Mac, and we knew we had to include it in 1Password X as well. Watchtower integrates with the <a href=\"https://haveibeenpwned.com\">haveibeenpwned.com</a> service to let you know if any of your passwords has been exposed in a data breach.</p> \n<img src=\"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/b5x1.10/watchtower.png\" alt=\"Large Type for a generated password\" title=\"Large Type for a generated password\" style=\"max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;\" /> \n<h3 id=\"easy-two-factor-authentication-2fa\">Easy two-factor authentication (2FA)</h3> \n<p>1Password X already filled authentication codes automatically, but now it can save them, too. You can scan QR codes directly from the 1Password X pop-up to add one-time passwords to your logins. It’s the easiest way to use 1Password as an authenticator for sites that use two-factor authentication.</p> \n<img src=\"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/b5x1.10/2fa.png\" alt=\"Scanning a QR code from the pop-up\" title=\"Scanning a QR code from the pop-up\" style=\"max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;\" /> \n<h2 id=\"1password-x--linux\">1Password X ������ Linux</h2> \n<p>1Password X is a wonderful experience on your Mac or Windows PC, but we’re especially proud of how well it works on Linux.

Accel will be investing USD$200 million for a minority stake in 1Password. Along with the investment ��� their largest initial investment in their 35-year history ��� Accel brings the experience and expertise we need to grow further and faster.</p>\n<p>1Password is a completely bootstrapped company that���s never taken a dime of outside investment, so this announcement may surprise some of you. We���ve built the most-loved password manager and a world-class company, all while remaining profitable during our entire history. So why, after 14 years of self-funding, are we now partnering with Accel? That���s a great question. To answer it, let���s visit our founding heroes where it all began.</p>\n<h2 id=\"weve-come-so-far\">We���ve come so far</h2>\n<p>When Roustem and I founded 1Password in 2005, we were trying to solve a simple problem. We were developing a lot of websites, and filling out forms to test them was time-consuming. We started a one-month passion project so we could get our work done more quickly. We thought others might enjoy this as well, so on May 19, 2006, we uploaded <a href=\"https://app-updates.agilebits.com/product_history/OPM2#v2024\">the first version of ���1Passwd���</a> to MacUpdate and VersionTracker.</p>\n<p>We were surprised by how many people loved it. Folks immediately began providing feedback, and we incorporated a lot of it into new releases, which led to more feedback which led to more late-night coding sessions. It was an incredible virtuous cycle. ����</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/accel-partnership/happy-founders-coding.png' alt='Happy Founders Coding. Yours truly is on the left and the illustrious Roustem Karimov is on the right.' title='Happy Founders Coding. Yours truly is on the left and the illustrious Roustem Karimov is on the right.' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>Since then, 1Password has become more successful than we ever dreamed. It���s been humbling to watch as we���ve crossed one milestone after another. I still remember with fondness hiring our first employee, planning our first <a href=\"https://blog.1password.com/agconf9-adventures-on-the-high-seas/\">AGConf</a>, recruiting my friend as CEO, opening our first office, and acquiring our first enterprise customer with over 300,000 employees.</p>\n<p>In fact, <em>millions</em> of people use 1Password every day, including hundreds of thousands of families. And we have <em>over</em> 50,000 (fifty thousand!) paying business customers, like Basecamp, Slack, and IBM ��� with employees who actually enjoy using 1Password.</p>\n<p>Being able to include IBM in that list is especially meaningful to me because I started my career at IBM as an intern in 1998, and they helped me create some of the best memories of my life.</p>\n<h2 id=\"weve-stayed-true-to-our-values\">We���ve stayed true to our values</h2>\n<p>With all that growth, I���m proud that the company I co-founded still reflects our core values. In fact, they���ve gotten stronger. We���ve been able to grow our team to turn our values into reality faster than Roustem and I ever could have on our own.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Privacy.</strong> We���ve always believed that privacy is a human right, and that���s why 1Password doesn���t have ads or track you. We even have a dedicated Privacy Officer who has the authority to make sure this never changes.</li>\n<li><strong>Security.</strong> Everyone deserves to be safe online, so we created the most modern security design to protect your data. Our expanded security team was able to complete our SOC2 certification and offer the highest bug bounty on BugCrowd.</li>\n<li><strong>Love.</strong> Love is an unexpected company value, but we mean it. We poured our heart and soul into 1Password every day for the last 14 years to give customers like you the love you deserve.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By growing our team we were able to double down on what���s most important to us. We want to do more, and we���re ready to take the next step.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/accel-partnership/gang-of-four.jpg' alt='Our executive team, a.k.a. the Gang of Four.

We were profitable and didn���t see the value in partnering with someone else. It was fun to grow the company ourselves from 2 to 176, but just like when we hired our CEO, we���ve reached a point where we need expertise and guidance from those who���ve made this journey before.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, over the past 6 years we built a friendship with Arun Mathew from <a href=\"https://www.accel.com/\">Accel</a>. Accel has a lot of experience growing sustainable, founder-led companies like ours. We���ve watched them partner with other companies and nurture the things that made those companies great in the first place, change the things that were holding them back, and ��� most importantly ��� know the difference between the two. ����</p>\n<p>Our friend Arun will be joining our board of directors along with Roustem, Sara, Jeff, and myself. For years we wanted the benefit of having an outside perspective, and we&rsquo;re thrilled to finally get it. Our relationship is a true partnership, not just an influx of cash. We���re not getting ready for an exit. We���re boarding a rocket ship.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/accel-partnership/new-friends.jpg' alt='Group hug after sealing the deal in our St. Thomas, Ontario office.

With Accel at our side, we have an opportunity to execute on our vision at an even faster pace with the help of some really smart friends.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Privacy.</strong> Privacy is a human right. Our partnership with Accel helps ensure that we have the resources to not only stay at the forefront of the privacy landscape, but push the industry forward as well.</li>\n<li><strong>Security.</strong> Security is a process, not a product. 1Password already has the most modern security design, and Accel will help us take our processes, protections, and research to the next level.</li>\n<li><strong>Love.</strong> Love is what makes 1Password truly special. With Accel���s help, we���re going to triple down on providing the best user experience and the customer support you deserve. ������</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It���s important to me that you see the parallels between this list and the one I showed you earlier. <a href=\"https://www.accel.com/interests/OurSeriesAIn1Password\">Our partnership with Accel</a> doesn���t represent a change in direction. Our values are what make 1Password 1Password-y. They���ve guided us this far, and they���ll lead the way through the next 14 years and beyond. Partnering with Accel allows us to be more 1Password-y than ever.</p>\n<p>Whether you joined us on our journey 14 years ago or 14 days ago, I want to offer you a heartfelt thanks. We wouldn���t have reached this point without you, and we���re honored to have you aboard this rocket ship with us. ����������</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/accel-partnership/agconf.png' alt='Our team at our annual cruise.' title='Our team at our annual cruise.' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>P.S.

Since then just about everything has changed. Grocery shopping has gotten a whole lot more strategic. Celebrating birthdays and special occasions requires a new level of creativity. And continuing with school necessitates that parents and kids alike embrace new modes of learning.</p>\n<p>Despite those, and other challenges, it���s good to remind ourselves that many things remain the same. Even if we have to do it from a distance, we still love to share laughter with friends and family. We still enjoy reading a good book, we just happen to be reading a few more than usual. And we still love improving the 1Password experience for you!</p>\n<p>Here are some of the ways we���ve improved 1Password this time around.</p>\n<h2 id=\"sort-your-items\">Sort your items</h2>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2020/opa75/opa75-sorting.png' alt='Sort your items' title='Sort your items' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>With all the time we have at home these days, there&rsquo;s an extra opportunity for spring cleaning. And a good cleaning starts with sorting through your stuff. We&rsquo;ve made that easier than ever in 1Password with all new sorting options.</p>\n<p><strong>Date modified</strong>. Identify and clean out old items you haven&rsquo;t updated in years.</p>\n<p><strong>Recent items</strong>. Grab the items you created most recently and finish organizing them with tags and vaults.</p>\n<p><strong>Password strength</strong>. Easily identify your weakest passwords and make them stronger.</p>\n<p><strong>Sort by website</strong>. Quickly scan and identify duplicate Login items.</p>\n<p>1Password remembers your sorting choice, so you can choose how you want to sort your items all the time!</p>\n<h2 id=\"link-to-items\">Link to items</h2>\n<p>When you want to <a href=\"https://support.1password.com/family-sharing/\">securely share</a> an item with a colleague or a family member, you drop it into a shared vault so that they can access it.

No more typos or searching in the wrong vault!</p>\n<h2 id=\"mark-up-notes-with-markdown\">Mark up notes with Markdown</h2>\n<p>While 1Password will never replace your favorite text editor, you won&rsquo;t find a more secure place to store your notes.

We&rsquo;ve streamlined the app you know and love, so it runs smoother, faster, and more intuitively.</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s a lot to like about this latest Windows release, and we&rsquo;ve got you covered with an overview of the essential features. As always, you can view the <a href=\"https://app-updates.agilebits.com/product_history/OPW6\">release notes</a> for a full list of all the changes and updates.</p>\n<h2 id=\"say-hello-to-1password\">Say Hello to 1Password</h2>\n<p>Windows Hello integrates smoothly into your workflow, eliminating the need to stop and type out a passcode to open an app or sign in to an account. The built-in biometrics use fingerprint or facial recognition to give you instant access to your information.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2020/opw74/How-Hello-works.gif' alt='Windows Hello and 1Password' title='Windows Hello and 1Password' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>And in this release, we&rsquo;ve made it even easier! In 1Password 7.4, we now automatically invoke Hello on every lock view, eliminating the button needed to gain access to the biometric systems. Removing that extra step means the app opens, and your information is available with just a tap or a glance.</p>\n<h2 id=\"move-items-with-ease\">Move items with ease</h2>\n<p>Keeping your items organized in 1Password makes it easier for you to find just what you need. However, do you find yourself needing to move items from one vault to another? With the new and improved drag and drop in 1Password for Windows, it&rsquo;s easy to move or copy an item from one vault to another.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2020/opw74/Move_items_with_ease.png' alt='Move items with ease' title='Move items with ease' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>But what if you want to sign in to the Steam app to start gaming? Now you can drag and drop to autofill. Just drag your username and password from 1Password to any app on your PC. Game on.</p>\n<h2 id=\"smoother-faster-safer\">Smoother, faster, safer</h2>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s where we get a bit more technical because this release also brings along some significant performance improvements behind the scenes to provide better protection for you. In 1Password 7.4, we rebuilt the entire network stack and a good portion of the backend in Rust, and we updated some core components along the way. These changes mean 1Password will detect your network settings and handle complex setups with ease, including various proxy standards.\n1Password also now performs more tasks in separate processes. This means that when one task is done, the memory is freed up faster.</p>\n<p>We also rethought our approach to the clipboard. From now on, nothing you copy in 1Password will be stored in the clipboard history or sent to the cloud clipboard. If you want to use the cloud clipboard in Windows 10, you don&rsquo;t have to worry about your 1Password data.</p>\n<p>This update is a free for everyone with a 1Password membership. <a href=\"https://1password.com/downloads/windows/\">Download 1Password 7.4 for Windows today.</a></p>\n<p>We hope you love this update as much as we&rsquo;ve loved building it for you!

Today I want to take a different tack, and provide an outward look at how companies are adapting to the sudden changes thrust upon them by COVID-19.</p>\n<p>In recent weeks, we&rsquo;ve been polling knowledge workers in the United States to find out how the opportunities and challenges of remote work are affecting companies and their employees.</p>\n<p>The picture that emerges illustrates not only the mammoth scale of the change, but also the pivotal role that IT is playing in enabling it. That&rsquo;s IT both in terms of the technology itself, and the professionals that make IT happen. In this post, I want to share some of the highlights from what we&rsquo;ve discovered, and talk about the heroic efforts that we&rsquo;re seeing in IT departments in businesses everywhere.</p>\n<p>Though we&rsquo;ve only spoken with workers in the United States, we&rsquo;ve no reason to think the picture isn&rsquo;t representative for businesses around the world.</p>\n<p>Before we dig deeper into the results, I do just want to highlight a couple of particularly telling stats:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>89% of respondents had no criticism of their company���s IT team.</strong> Given the scale of the upheaval, that���s a remarkable testament to the incredible work IT teams are doing.</li>\n<li><strong>68% of respondents prefer working from home either some or all of the time.</strong> And a large shift is also underway in terms of attitude, with a significant majority becoming happier with the idea of remote working.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"a-gigantic-upheaval\">A gigantic upheaval</h2>\n<p>Between April 15 and 23, we surveyed 1,000 desk-based knowledge workers in the United States, and the results show just how colossal the shift to remote working has been. Half of those surveyed were IT professionals. An enormous 89% of respondents have newly made the shift to remote work. ���Revolution��� may sound like hyperbole, but I think it&rsquo;s justified when we look at the scale of what���s happening for the millions of workers who use computers for their day-to-day job.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2020/wfh-survey-results/transitioned.png' alt='Have you recently transitioned to remote work?' title='Have you recently transitioned to remote work?' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>The results also speak to the massive transition those companies have made. Only 27% of respondents thought their company was completely prepared for the move, leaving a large majority that had to do some figuring out. That said, only 13% of respondents thought their company wasn&rsquo;t at all prepared, suggesting that the vast majority of companies were already working in remote-friendly ways to some extent.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;d love to learn more about the ways people think their companies were or weren&rsquo;t prepared. Few could have predicted a COVID-19-like event. If some companies were more prepared than others, my bet is that it&rsquo;s down to the flexibility granted by forward-thinking IT planning and policy. More than ever, we&rsquo;re reliant on cloud-hosted or -connected services more than standalone software. Clearly, though, some have gone farther on that journey than others. Those CTOs and technology leaders should take a bow right now.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s ironic that, of the companies with a historical objection to the idea of remote working, many will have been gradually preparing for it all the same, simply by virtue of keeping up with trends in technology. The more you use tools and processes that work anywhere, the easier remote working becomes if and when you do it. Much of the infrastructure for remote work was already in place ��� where people sit is merely the last piece of the puzzle.</p>\n<p>In short, recent events have seen a massive acceleration of a shift that was already well under way.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-it-challenge-is-huge--and-complex\">The IT challenge is huge ��� and complex</h2>\n<p>Digging deeper into the results, it quickly becomes clear the massive role IT is playing in this shift to remote working. &ldquo;Facilitating&rdquo; is an understatement ��� IT teams are enabling new ways of working, solving technical problems, and, frankly, saving the day right now.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2020/wfh-survey-results/strengthen-protocols.png' alt='Have IT departments strengthened security protocols in the move to remote work?' title='Have IT departments strengthened security protocols in the move to remote work?' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>Unsurprisingly, security is a particular focal point for companies making the change, but it&rsquo;s not a straightforward picture, with about a third of IT respondents saying their companies have strengthened some security protocols, and a third saying they have relaxed some. (And perhaps unsurprisingly, larger firms were more likely than small ones to have made no changes.)</p>\n<p>In hindsight, our survey should have allowed that both strengthening and relaxing is simultaneously possible. On the one hand, companies may be seeking tighter security when it comes to password policies, two-factor authentication or access to data. On the other, they may seek to loosen policies when it comes to using a wider selection of apps and services to help remote workers get things done: in other words, <a href=\"https://blog.1password.com/remote-work-shadow-it/\">bringing shadow IT into the light</a>.</p>\n<p>Indeed, a tightening of general security would help facilitate more relaxed IT policies. Half the respondents who are breaking their company&rsquo;s policy are doing so in an attempt to be more productive.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2020/wfh-survey-results/follow-protocols.png' alt='Do IT professionals think security protocols are followed better or worse from home?' title='Do IT professionals think security protocols are followed better or worse from home?' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>But, accordance with security measures has actually increased, according to 63% of IT professionals polled. This may be down to a greater awareness of security issues (no doubt helped by company guidance) and increased senses of accountability and responsibility when working from home.</p>\n<p>Who knows? Perhaps just sitting in an office, complete with security guards, locked doors, and visibly-present IT and security teams lulls people into a sense of security ��� and one that may be to some extent false given the nature of online threats. Companies still dubious of remote working should take note: this survey suggests remote workers are taking security more seriously than ever. And their first priority is being productive.</p>\n<h2 id=\"hero-of-the-storm\">Hero of the storm</h2>\n<p>Clearly, IT teams are performing a sort of administrative gymnastics in order to help companies and their staff get work done while simultaneously keeping everyone safe.</p>\n<p>And that&rsquo;s on top of the increased workload of supporting remote workers with their day-to-day IT needs. Respondents report the top IT requests are help resolving connectivity issues, setting up devices, and handling software updates.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2020/wfh-survey-results/hero.png' alt='A big 89% of people looking happy about their IT teams' title='A big 89% of people looking happy about their IT teams' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>And to return to that first stat, perhaps most remarkable of all: 89% of respondents had no criticism at all of their company&rsquo;s IT teams. It&rsquo;s clear that the IT industry ��� and more-so the myriad IT teams out there in the corporate world ��� are doing sterling work to keep the companies they support in business in these difficult times.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2020/wfh-survey-results/prefer-work.png' alt='Where would you prefer to work?' title='Where would you prefer to work?' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>It���s also clear that recent events are changing minds. Some 68% of respondents prefer working from home either some or all of the time, and 59% of respondents have become more favorable to doing so.</p>\n<p>We&rsquo;ve always been believers in remote work at 1Password. But the signs are that with recent changes, more and more people are becoming believers too. Our survey indicates that remote workers are happy, productive and security-conscious thanks to the technology ��� and people ��� that support remote work.</p>\n<p>We&rsquo;re also long-time believers in IT teams and the important work they do. We&rsquo;re proud to have built 1Password into an app loved by many IT professionals. We understand the challenges they face, and we&rsquo;re doubling down on making 1Password as easy as possibly to deploy, support and ��� above all ��� use.</p>\n<p>A big thank you to everyone that took part in the survey.</p>\n<section class=\"c-call-to-action-box c-call-to-action-box--background-author\">\n<div class=\"c-call-to-action-box__author\">\n<img src=\"https://blog.1password.com/img/authors/jeffshiner.jpg\" class=\"c-call-to-action-box__author-image\" alt=\"Jeff Shiner\"/>\n</div>\n<div class=\"c-call-to-action-box__content\">\n<h3 class=\"c-call-to-action-box__title\">Sign up for 1Password Business</h3>\n<div class=\"c-call-to-action-box__text\">\nSign up for 1Password Business today and get your first 30 days free.\n</div>\n<a href=\"https://1password.com/teams/pricing/\" class=\"c-call-to-action-box__link-href c-call-to-action-box__link-href--stacked\" data-on=\"click\" data-event-category=\"CTA\" data-event-action=\"call-to-action-button\">\nTry 1Password FREE\n</a>\n</div>\n</section>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 21 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":10468,"bgimg":"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2020/wfh-survey-results/header.png","linkMd5":"f3e7f8fbbbc7185f854ea13ad3d6dea2","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn38@2020_4/2020/08/25/00-54-54-712_ed6c152b390029d6.webp","destWidth":2080,"destHeight":800,"sourceBytes":34441,"destBytes":41230,"author":"Jeff Shiner","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2020/wfh-survey-results/header.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn38@2020_4/2020/08/25/00-54-54-712_ed6c152b390029d6.webp","https://blog.1password.com/posts/2020/wfh-survey-results/transitioned.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn35@2020_2/2020/08/25/00-55-06-935_61d007526ac3887b.webp","https://blog.1password.com/posts/2020/wfh-survey-results/strengthen-protocols.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn36@2020_5/2020/08/25/00-55-08-689_eedc2ac0f6fd5344.webp","https://blog.1password.com/posts/2020/wfh-survey-results/follow-protocols.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn8@2020_1/2020/08/25/00-55-10-780_8bd0c2f75da9441d.webp","https://blog.1password.com/posts/2020/wfh-survey-results/hero.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn63@2020_4/2020/08/25/00-55-01-211_1d39aa1925b4fba6.webp","https://blog.1password.com/posts/2020/wfh-survey-results/prefer-work.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn40@2020_5/2020/08/25/00-55-10-947_7b9b67c76061153c.webp","https://blog.1password.com/img/authors/jeffshiner.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn94@2020_2/2020/08/25/00-54-58-584_836257a2e780b371.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598316891413},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:54:51","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:54:51","title":"1Password command-line tool 0.2: Tim���s new toys","link":"https://blog.1password.com/1password-command-line-tool-0.2-tims-new-toys/","description":"\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/cli-0.2/header.png' class='webfeedsFeaturedVisual' alt='1Password command-line tool 0.2: Tim���s new toys' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p class=\"introduction\">Some of you may know Tim, our Beardless Keeper of Keys and Grounds here at AgileBits. Tim and his team keep everything running smoothly. The servers are serving happily and the networks are flowing gracefully. Tim is also the administrator of our company team on 1Password.com.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/cli-0.2/arcade-machine.png' alt='Tim standing behind a CLI themed arcade machine' title='Tim standing behind a CLI themed arcade machine' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>Tim can script and automate with the best of them, and from the moment he got a preview of <code>op</code>, the DevOps team began bombarding us with feedback. One of the first things he asked for was the ability to create vaults, so we added that right away. But we knew we could still do more for Tim ��� after all he was on the nice list this year ��� so we got him some new toys to play with. If you���re too excited to read more, you can just <a href=\"https://app-updates.agilebits.com/product_history/CLI\">start playing with <code>op</code> 0.2 now</a>. To find out more, read on.</p>\n<h2 id=\"vault-into-the-new-year\">Vault into the new year</h2>\n<p>Our first gift to Tim was more control over vault access. He can now use <code>op</code> to add users to vaults, remove users from vaults, and even delete vaults.</p>\n<p>So when Dave told Tim about a new project (codenamed Honey Badger), it was easy to set things up.</p>\n<p>Dave needed two developers, Chris and Betty, as well as one of our designers, Matt, involved in the project. With the command-line tool, Tim can switch to his terminal and do this right away.

He can now use <code>op</code> to create and delete groups and choose who belongs to them.</p>\n<p>When Dave told Tim that Wendy was moving from the support team to the design team, Tim just casually sipped his cocoa. He knew this would be trivial.

When I&rsquo;m on the move, I need a device that���s both powerful and portable, so I often work from my iPad. And while I love my iPad, I���ve recently been thinking about changing it up.</p>\n<p>I���ve spent a lot of time with our <a href=\"https://blog.1password.com/1password-7-for-windows-the-best-ever/\">Windows team lately</a>, hearing about the hard work they���ve put into 1Password for Windows, and it���s given me some food for thought. Now, I&rsquo;m seriously considering swapping my iPad for a new Surface Pro. Here���s why.</p>\n<h2 id=\"privacy-focused-browsing\">Privacy-focused browsing</h2>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve been using <a href=\"https://blog.1password.com/taking-a-peek-at-microsoft-edge-for-mac/\">Edge on my Mac</a> for a few months now, and I���ve been impressed by its performance and security features. Edge is faster, lighter-weight, and more secure than its predecessor, Internet Explorer. It���s the same browser I���ve come to know and love on my Mac, but feels even more intuitive on the Surface Pro.</p>\n<p>And it���s only going to get better. The <a href=\"https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2019/11/04/edge-chromium-release-candidate-get-ready/\">new Microsoft Edge, currently in beta,</a> is built on the Chromium engine, giving it better compatibility with extensions and websites. The new version of Edge is more privacy-focused and includes features like tracking prevention and InPrivate mode, which keeps my searches and browsing safe.</p>\n<h2 id=\"unlocking-with-ease\">Unlocking with ease</h2>\n<p>Working from a tablet rather than a laptop means I don&rsquo;t always have my hands free to type my passwords easily. With Windows Hello, I can get straight back to work using biometric authentication to unlock my screen and open 1Password.</p>\n<p>On the Surface Pro, to unlock 1Password, I just <a href=\"https://support.1password.com/windows-hello/#set-up-windows-hello\">place my finger on the fingerprint sensor or glance at the camera</a>, making it quick and easy to pick up where I left off.</p>\n<h2 id=\"make-it-my-way\">Make it my way</h2>\n<p>I&rsquo;m guilty of having too many applications, windows, and tabs open on my computer at any given time. It&rsquo;s easy for something to get lost, often forcing me to click through everything to find what I need. It can be frustrating, especially when I���m in a rush.</p>\n<p>The revamped <a href=\"https://support.1password.com/keyboard-shortcuts/\">keyboard shortcuts in 1Password 7</a> work great on the Surface Pro and put all my information at the tip of my fingers. I can customize or disable shortcuts as needed, so 1Password fits seamlessly with my workflow.</p>\n<h2 id=\"keep-it-small\">Keep it small</h2>\n<p>To keep clutter to a minimum, I love using 1Password mini and it feels right at home on the Surface Pro. I can quickly and easily access my information, without having the full-screen version of 1Password open. This comes in handy for filling in details on apps and websites that don���t have 1Password integration.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/windows-surface-pro/SP1Pmini.png' alt='1Password Mini on the Surface Pro' title='1Password Mini on the Surface Pro' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>The 1Password mini on Windows even supports the Quick Copy menu, so I can quickly copy usernames, passwords or grab a one-time password. I just open 1Password mini and everything I need is ready. Best of all, when 1Password detects the use of two-factor authentication, it will automatically copy a one-time use password to the clipboard.</p>\n<p>Are you using 1Password on a Surface Pro?

It���s time to take the wraps off something incredible that changes the world as we know it: 1Password 7 for Mac is here! ��������</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s a ton of amazing features packed into this release and I couldn&rsquo;t stop myself from writing a <em>lot</em> about them. If you&rsquo;d like to start rocking right away, feel free to jump ahead and <a href=\"https://app-updates.agilebits.com/download/OPM7\">download 1Password 7</a> now. For everyone else, it&rsquo;s my distinct pleasure to share with you the awesome that is 1Password 7.</p>\n<h2 id=\"marvellous-mini\">Marvellous mini</h2>\n<p>1Password mini is how most of us use 1Password on a daily basis and for version 7 we wanted to make that experience the best it could be.</p>\n<p>1Password mini has been completely reimagined and comes with so many features that we needed to give it its own window. When you bring up mini you&rsquo;ll find it waiting for you with an incredibly powerful and beautiful new look.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/opm7.0/mini-favourites.png' alt='1Password mini unlocked showing favourited items' title='1Password mini unlocked showing favourited items' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>While in your browser, mini will automatically suggest the items you&rsquo;re most likely to need. Select the login you want to sign in with and 1Password will do the rest.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/opm7.0/mini-suggested-items-evernote.png' alt='1Password mini showing suggested items for Evernote.com' title='1Password mini showing suggested items for Evernote.com' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>And mini doesn&rsquo;t limit itself to just browsers. With our new app integration we&rsquo;ll automatically suggest logins for the current app you&rsquo;re using. Along with support for drag and drop, this is a real game changer.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/opm7.0/mini-drag-and-drop-into-itunes.png' alt='Drag and drop passwords from 1Password mini into iTunes' title='Drag and drop passwords from 1Password mini into iTunes' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>You can also make edits, move items between vaults, and even add documents ��� all without ever leaving mini. Soon you&rsquo;ll wonder how you ever lived without it. ����</p>\n<h2 id=\"beautiful-bold-design\">Beautiful, bold design</h2>\n<p>The beauty you&rsquo;ll find in mini continues throughout the rest of 1Password as well. It all starts with the newly designed lock screen and it looks incredible, especially with Touch ID.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/opm7.0/locked-touch-id.jpeg' alt='1Password locked and ready to unlock using Touch ID' title='1Password locked and ready to unlock using Touch ID' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>As great as those vault doors look, they pale in comparison to what lies secured behind them.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/opm7.0/unlocked-main-list-view.jpeg' alt='1Password 7 main view after unlocking' title='1Password 7 main view after unlocking' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>The first thing that grabs you is the stunning new sidebar. It draws you in with its bold dark theme and delights you with its simplicity.</p>\n<p>The new sidebar looks great without being overpowering and the high contrast between it and your content allows your eyes to focus on what&rsquo;s most important: <em>your items</em>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"detailing-your-items\">Detailing your items</h2>\n<p>Your items are able to join in on the fun as well with a new design and some lovely new touches. Each of your items now prominently show which vault they belong to and have their most important information highlighted.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/opm7.0/item-details.jpeg' alt='Login details' title='Login details' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>If you caught yourself yelling <em>What Are Those?!</em> when looking at the formatted notes field, you&rsquo;re not alone. You can now give your notes richly formatted text using Markdown! ����</p>\n<p>Along with the improved layout and typography, we&rsquo;ve added a beautiful custom font created specifically for 1Password called Courier Prime Bits (based on the lovely <a href=\"https://quoteunquoteapps.com/courierprime/\">Courier Prime</a>).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/a-dg\">Alan Dague-Greene</a> is the creative genius behind this font and it makes large type passwords look absolutely incredible.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/opm7.0/large-type.png' alt='Large Type' title='Large Type' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>Speaking of incredible, when you combine our new custom font with Markdown support, Secure Notes are now at an entirely new level of awesome.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/opm7.0/secure-notes-markdown.jpeg' alt='Secure Markdown Notes' title='Secure Markdown Notes' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>Once you start using Markdown in your notes you&rsquo;ll find yourself wanting to create a lot of them. And when you do, you can keep your notes and items organized using tags. You can even use nested tags if you want to be fancy.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/opm7.0/nested-tags.jpeg' alt='Organizing items with nested tags' title='Organizing items with nested tags' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>Oh and if you need to copy fields between items or into another app, you can detach the item details view into its own separate window by clicking the <img src=\"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/opm7.0/inline-pop-out-icon.png\" alt=\"Pop out toolbar icon\"> button in the toolbar. This is incredibly useful although to be honest I often find myself clicking it for no other reason than to see the lovely animation. ����</p>\n<h2 id=\"watching-out-for-you\">Watching out for you</h2>\n<p>1Password 7 is doubling down on how it keeps you safe online. We have bundled together a suite of security tools that notify you of breaches, warn you of bad habits, and highlight vulnerable passwords. We call it Watchtower and it&rsquo;s amazing.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/opm7.0/watchtower.jpeg' alt='Watchtower suite of security tools' title='Watchtower suite of security tools' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>Watchtower integrates with Troy Hunt���s <a href=\"https://haveibeenpwned.com/\">haveibeenpwned.com</a> service to see if any of your logins are vulnerable. 1Password securely checks your items against a collection of breached passwords (over 500 million and counting) and notifies you to change them.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/opm7.0/have-i-been-pwned-yes.jpeg' alt='Watchtower highlighting a Pwned Password' title='Watchtower highlighting a Pwned Password' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>And thanks to <a href=\"https://twofactorauth.org\">twofactorauth.org</a>, Watchtower also knows which websites support two factor authentication and will alert you when it finds logins without 2FA enabled.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/opm7.0/watchtower-enable-2fa.png' alt='Watchtower warning that 2FA is not enabled' title='Watchtower warning that 2FA is not enabled' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>Watchtower will also alert you to logins that are using an insecure (HTTP) website address, weak passwords, and horror of horrors, reused passwords (seriously, don&rsquo;t do that!). And finally it&rsquo;ll even warn you if your credit cards or passports are expiring soon so you don&rsquo;t miss out on your vacation. ����</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/opm7.0/watchtower-expiring-soon.jpeg' alt='Watchtower alert for an expiring passport' title='Watchtower alert for an expiring passport' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<h2 id=\"organize-amp-securely-share-your-items\">Organize &amp; securely share your items</h2>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s get back to that sidebar because there&rsquo;s more there than meets the eye. Sitting just beneath the surface is a powerful new way to organize and securely share your items.</p>\n<p>Simply click on the sidebar header and your categories will slide away, revealing your collection of vaults. Vaults allow you to group your items depending on their purpose and who needs access to them.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/opm7.0/sidebar-vaults.jpeg' alt='Sidebar with vaults revealed' title='Sidebar with vaults revealed' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>You can drag and drop items between vaults and even between accounts. Or, drop your items on the New Vault button and a new vault will be created for you right then and there. It&rsquo;s so simple it&rsquo;s like magic.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/opm7.0/edit-vault.jpeg' alt='Create new vault' title='Create new vault' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>Once you have your new vault created, sharing it with your team or family couldn&rsquo;t be easier. Select who you want to have access to your vault and 1Password will do the rest.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/opm7.0/manage-vault-access.jpeg' alt='Manage vault access' title='Manage vault access' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>Best of all, any updates to the items appear automatically for everyone. It&rsquo;s easier to share securely with 1Password than being insecure without it. ����</p>\n<h2 id=\"strong-foundations\">Strong foundations</h2>\n<p>Along with all these new features and improvements, a lot of heavy lifting took place to make 1Password 7 faster and secure-er than ever.</p>\n<p>It all began by combining 1Password and 1Password mini into a single process. This made items faster to load, reduced memory usage, and decreased launch times. The overall performance boosts made us smile as soon as we saw them and we think they&rsquo;ll make you smile, too.</p>\n<p>Also new in 1Password 7, we&rsquo;ve taken advantage of Apple&rsquo;s Secure Enclave to protect your Master Password when Touch ID is enabled. This is incredibly cool because the keys used for encryption are protected by the hardware and not accessible to other programs or the operating system.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/opm7.0/touch-id-prompt.jpeg' alt='Touch ID unlock prompt' title='Touch ID unlock prompt' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>And if you&rsquo;re moving over to our new 1Password memberships, syncing your data is <a href=\"https://1password.com/security/\">more secure</a> than ever. With the addition of a Secret Key, Secure Remote Password, and Galois/Counter Mode, your data has never been safer. And the speed and reliability is simply unparalleled.</p>\n<h2 id=\"and-so-much-much-much-more\">And so much much much more!</h2>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/opm7.0/collapsed-sidebar.png' alt='Collapsed sidebar for small screen warriors' title='Collapsed sidebar for small screen warriors' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>I told you at the beginning that I was going to write a <em>lot</em> about 1Password 7 and I could keep going. But in the interest of getting you into 1Password 7 sooner, I&rsquo;m curtailing the rest into this fancy bulleted list!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Collapse the sidebar entirely so your items get all the love</li>\n<li>Quickly find items with our new Spotlight integration</li>\n<li>Use Handoff to view iOS items right from your Dock</li>\n<li>Easily see your currently selected vault and account</li>\n<li>Marvel at the monogrammed icons for tags and logins</li>\n<li>Edit your vaults directly from the sidebar</li>\n<li>Enjoy the new password strength meter</li>\n<li>Remove duplicate items on a per-vault basis</li>\n<li>Jump to items and vaults with ease using Quick Open</li>\n<li>Opt in to automatic updates so you can always enjoy the latest and greatest 1Password has to offer</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"how-do-i-get-it\">How do I get it?</h2>\n<p>To start enjoying the best version of 1Password ever built, grab it here:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://app-updates.agilebits.com/download/OPM7\">Download 1Password 7</a></p>\n<p>1Password 7 is included free for everyone with a 1Password membership. Simply unlock 1Password after downloading and you&rsquo;re good to go.</p>\n<p>Those of you with a standalone license for version 6 will be prompted to subscribe or purchase a license when 1Password 7 first opens. Licenses will cost $64.99 but are available during our launch special for only $49.99.

width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p class=\"introduction\">As we all adjust to our new normal and many of us are working from home for the first time, it���s important to look beyond productivity advice and consider the deeper impact of this situation.</p>\n<p>There are plenty of reports that highlight the benefits of remote working, but it also has consequences for our mental and emotional health that need to be carefully considered.</p>\n<p>As an experienced remote team these are lessons we���ve been able to learn over the last 14 years, but it can���t be emphasized enough that nothing about this situation is &ldquo;normal&rdquo;. All of the struggles and side effects of remote work will be amplified by current events, so it���s more important than ever to be aware of them and to look after yourself.</p>\n<h2 id=\"stop-worrying-about-productivity\">Stop worrying about productivity</h2>\n<p>It���s likely you���re finding it hard to be productive right now because there���s a lot going on. You might have <a href=\"https://blog.1password.com/working-from-home-kids/\">kids at home</a>, be working in a new and distracting environment, or just worrying more than usual ��� you���re not alone. A <a href=\"https://content.thriveglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Thriving-in-the-New-Normal-March-2020-Thrive-Global.pdf\">new report from Thrive Global</a> found that more than 80% of US employees now feel significantly more distracted and, on average, that more than 45% of their workdays have been lost due to distraction and time spent worrying.</p>\n<p>It���s hard to overstate the impact of this crisis on our lives and our work. The effects of COVID-19 are huge, widespread and are happening fast. It���s not often we find ourselves adjusting to a whole new workflow and dealing with an existential crisis at the same time, so it���s important to be kind to yourself.</p>\n<p>Use the flexibility that remote work provides to take advantage of short, productive moments and stop for a break when you need to. With a 24-hour news cycle and new headlines every minute, getting distracted is easy. Try to build time into your day for these distractions and don���t beat yourself up about it if you do get sidetracked.</p>\n<h2 id=\"fighting-feelings-of-isolation\">Fighting feelings of isolation</h2>\n<p>Now that most of us are on city- or country-wide lockdown, socialising is out of the question. That means work might be the only time you get to interact with other people. Make sure you take advantage of it. Try to have conversations that aren���t work-related and find time to talk about shared interests. This can sometimes be hard when your team is new to remote work but there are lots of things you can do to help <a href=\"https://blog.1password.com/remote-work-culture/\">create a culture</a> that supports these kinds of interactions.</p>\n<p>If you can, try to have face-to-face chats via video calls. The benefit of seeing and hearing other human beings can���t be overstated. There���s <a href=\"https://www.apa.org/monitor/2019/05/ce-corner-isolation\">plenty of evidence</a> that links social isolation to mental health issues and Buffer���s 2020 State of Remote Work report found that even in ���normal times��� <a href=\"https://lp.buffer.com/state-of-remote-work-2020\">loneliness was one of the biggest struggles for remote workers</a>. Getting ���face time��� with colleagues can help to combat any feelings of isolation you might be struggling with.</p>\n<p>At 1Password, we have a rolling ���watercooler&rdquo; video call where team members can drop in and out when they feel like it for the kind of casual, social interactions that are harder to do over text. During the pandemic, we���ve been having semi-regular ���happy hour��� calls where team members can sit down together to talk and have a drink.</p>\n<p>Normalizing conversations around mental health is important because it reminds us that we���re not alone and allows the team to help each other. At 1Password we have a dedicated #mental-health channel in Slack so the team has a safe space to discuss what they���re going through, get advice and share things that have worked for them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"break-up-your-days-to-avoid-burnout\">Break up your days to avoid burnout</h2>\n<p>When your home is suddenly your workplace and you find yourself with more spare time than you���re used to, you might be tempted to work more than usual. Studies have shown that <a href=\"https://lp.buffer.com/state-of-remote-work-2020\">���not being able to unplug���</a> is a problem for a lot of remote workers and that they���re <a href=\"https://www.toptal.com/remote/remote-work-burnout-a-cautionary-tale\">more prone to burnout than those working in offices</a>. It���s important to split your time up into work and leisure to add more structure to your days and avoid overworking.</p>\n<p>There are other ways you can create the work/life division too. The temptation to skip your morning shower, or sit in your PJs all day is understandable, but getting up and getting dressed is an important part of getting into the right mindset. You���ll feel better, be more productive, and it will help to make your weekends still feel like weekends, when there���s very little difference right now. Turn off Slack or email notifications when you���re not working so you can properly disconnect.</p>\n<p>Remember to take a proper lunch break rather than eating at your desk, and make sure to get up and grab a glass of water or a hot drink every once in a while.</p>\n<h2 id=\"physical-health-is-important-too\">Physical health is important too</h2>\n<p>If you���re no longer commuting to work, you���re likely spending less time outside your home. Although we all need to practice social distancing, right now, there are important aspects of the commute that you might be missing out on ��� fresh air, getting into the right frame of mind to work and maybe even getting some regular exercise.</p>\n<p>Staying active is just as important for your mental well-being as it is for your physical health. It can punctuate the start or end of your day, spend some energy that���s not getting used while you sit at your desk for eight hours, and it���s proven to <a href=\"https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/publications/how-to-using-exercise\">reduce stress and improve your mood.</a></p>\n<p>If you���re lucky enough to have outdoor space or if local guidelines allow you to exercise outside, then make the most of it ��� just make sure you stay six feet away from other people.</p>\n<p>If you don���t have outdoor space you can still get moving indoors too, even if you don���t have a lot of room. Companies like Nike are now <a href=\"https://news.nike.com/news/nike-digital-health-activity-resources\">offering their workout apps for free</a> so people can exercise at home. There are lots of simple things you can do to stay active during the day, like standing while you work or walking around during a call.</p>\n<h2 id=\"if-you-can-take-time-off\">If you can, take time off</h2>\n<p>It might seem counterintuitive right now since you can���t exactly book a trip or jump on a flight, but taking some time off might give you the headspace you need to make sense of recent events. Taking ���work��� out of the equation for a few days will give you one less thing to think about and let you focus on your own (or your family���s) emotional well-being instead. If you have kids at home and it���s possible, consider reducing your hours or taking regular days off so you can juggle all your new responsibilities with a little less pressure.</p>\n<p>If you���re managing a team be mindful that staff might take a bit longer to get things done or need to take some time out.</p>\n<h2 id=\"look-after-yourself\">Look after yourself</h2>\n<p>The most important thing you can do right now is to look after your own well-being. If you���re feeling overwhelmed, isolated or distracted, communicate these feelings with your team and your manager. Take time out if you need it and put your health first. After all, staying healthy is more important than anything else. Work can wait.</p>\n<section class=\"c-call-to-action-box c-call-to-action-box--background-author\">\n<div class=\"c-call-to-action-box__author\">\n<img src=\"https://blog.1password.com/img/authors/danielduke.jpg\" class=\"c-call-to-action-box__author-image\" alt=\"Daniel Duke\"/>\n</div>\n<div class=\"c-call-to-action-box__content\">\n<h3 class=\"c-call-to-action-box__title\">Get more security tips</h3>\n<div class=\"c-call-to-action-box__text\">\nSign up to our business security mailing list and get advice on running a secure, productive workplace delivered directly to your inbox.\n</div>\n<form accept-charset=\"UTF-8\" action=\"https://agilemail.createsend.com/t/r/s/ohlyduj/\" class=\"oneline\" data-event-category=\"Newsletter\" data-event-action=\"form-newsletter\" id=\"newsletterForm\" method=\"post\">\n<div id=\"hidden-fields\"><input name=\"utf8\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"���\"><input name=\"authenticity_token\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"B2cHFMPBG0KjOnROQ884zCYcI0afwrAx897/qCCfum0=\"></div>\n<input class=\"c-call-to-action-box__newsletter-email\" id=\"cm-ohlyduj-ohlyduj\" name=\"cm-ohlyduj-ohlyduj\" type=\"email\" placeholder=\"wendy@appleseed.com\">\n<input class=\"c-call-to-action-box__newsletter-button\" type=\"submit\" value=\"Sign up\">\n</form>\n</div>\n</section>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 07 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":10468,"bgimg":"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2020/mental-health/header.png","linkMd5":"8c5a9b530747c78a0896a43bf45f78d4","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn18@2020_1/2020/08/25/00-54-51-752_d3614aeecb7acac0.webp","destWidth":2080,"destHeight":800,"sourceBytes":144830,"destBytes":52848,"author":"Daniel Duke","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2020/mental-health/header.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn18@2020_1/2020/08/25/00-54-51-752_d3614aeecb7acac0.webp","https://blog.1password.com/img/authors/danielduke.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn60@2020_2/2020/08/25/00-55-03-032_232a4b42be307ea1.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598316891414},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:54:51","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:54:51","title":"1Password X: May 2019 update","link":"https://blog.1password.com/1password-x-may-2019-update/","description":"\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/b5x1.15/header.png' class='webfeedsFeaturedVisual' alt='1Password X: May 2019 update' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p class=\"introduction\">Welcome to the May update of 1Password X!

With one less column, things are now simpler, more responsive, and allow you to see your item details right away. Along with smart suggestions, you can quickly find your logins, credit cards, and identities when you need them.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/b5x1.15/NewPopupSuggestions.png' alt='1Password X showing suggestions for the current page: logins and credit cards' title='1Password X showing suggestions for the current page: logins and credit cards' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>Search feels more natural in the new design and is faster than ever. Start typing and 1Password will do the rest. After you find the login you&rsquo;re looking for, press Enter, and 1Password will open the website and automatically fill your information.</p>\n<p>If you need to manually type a password on another device, use Large Type to make it as easy as possible. And you&rsquo;re not limited to just passwords ��� you can now use Large Type for <em>all</em> of your item fields.</p>\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/b5x1.15/NewPopupLargeType.png' alt='1Password X pop-up showing a password in large type' title='1Password X pop-up showing a password in large type' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p>Watchtower alerts look great in the new design as well.

You don&rsquo;t need to lift a finger:</p>\n<p>\n<video class=\"round shadow\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; padding: 0;\"autoplay='true'muted='true'loop=\"loop\" playsinline=\"\" width=\"100%\" alt='1Password X automatically fills 2FA one-time passwords' controls>\n<source src=\"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/b5x1.15/TOTP-Filling-in-1Password-X.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" />\n</video>\n</p>\n<h2 id=\"detach-the-pop-up\">Detach the pop-up</h2>\n<p>You can now open the pop-up in its own window by clicking the\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/b5x1.15/detach-window.svg' alt='Open in new window' title='Open in new window' width='15px' />\nicon.

This time, Cat talks with Bennett Cyphers from Privacy Badger about tracking, blocking extensions, and what you can do to safeguard your data while browsing the Internet.</p>\n<div class=\"embed embed-16x9\">\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xydJ6w0kZDs\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe><br>\n</div>\n<p>Created by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/privacybadger\">Privacy Badger</a> is a browser extension designed to block advertisers and other third-party trackers from monitoring your web activity. It works in the background while you browse, automatically analyzing and blocking any code that seems to track you across multiple websites.</p>\n<p>Ad companies like Google and Facebook not only track you on their pages; they also use invisible pixels and cookies to follow your journey across the Internet.</p>\n<p>While we know it&rsquo;s not realistic for most people to quit Google and Facebook altogether, here are five other things you can do to protect your privacy online.</p>\n<h2 id=\"switch-to-a-privacy-focused-browser\">Switch to a privacy-focused browser</h2>\n<p>Google Chrome may be a popular browser, but it collects quite a bit of data about you.</p>\n<p>While there isn&rsquo;t a single best browser option, both <a href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/\">Mozilla&rsquo;s Firefox</a> and <a href=\"https://brave.com/\">Brave</a> are excellent choices for protecting your privacy and security.</p>\n<p>Firefox offers robust privacy features and can be customized to fit your individual security needs. Additionally, you have the option to enable several useful browser extensions that can enhance your privacy and security.</p>\n<p>Brave is built on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium_(web_browser)\">Chromium</a> and is privacy-focused by default. We recently took <a href=\"https://blog.1password.com/testing-brave-with-1password/\">Brave out for a spin</a> and were impressed by its speed and built-in security features.</p>\n<h2 id=\"use-a-blocking-extension\">Use a blocking extension</h2>\n<p>Browser extensions that block ads and trackers work behind the scenes to stop third-party code from capturing your personal information. Some only block cookies and others work as a full ad blocker.</p>\n<p>Privacy Badger is an extension that automatically analyzes and blocks any tracker or ad that violates the principle of user consent. Rather than working off an existing list of trackers and cookies to block, it learns as you browse.</p>\n<h2 id=\"change-your-search-engine\">Change your search engine</h2>\n<p>Google has earned its reputation as a robust search engine, but it comes with a price. To give you a personalized experience, Google tracks and stores an incredible amount of your personal information.</p>\n<p>And it&rsquo;s not just Google. Most big search engines are essentially data collectors for advertising companies, who use the information to create targeted ads. Thankfully, there are several privacy-focused search engines you can use as an alternative:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/\">DuckDuckGo</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.startpage.com/\">Startpage</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.qwant.com/\">Qwant</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"use-an-encrypted-messaging-service\">Use an encrypted messaging service</h2>\n<p>Unfortunately, many of the most popular messaging apps ��� like Facebook Messenger, Skype, and Snapchat ��� don&rsquo;t offer end-to-end encryption. This means your private information is at risk of being exposed to the companies behind the apps, and anybody they share it with.</p>\n<p>To keep your conversations away from prying eyes, it&rsquo;s a good idea to use an encrypted messaging service. Apps like Apple���s iMessage and <a href=\"https://signal.org/\">Signal</a> offer end-to-end encryption to keep your conversations private and secure.</p>\n<h2 id=\"we-need-strong-privacy-laws-to-protect-people\">We need strong privacy laws to protect people</h2>\n<p>Data breaches can happen to anyone, which is why we need to have strong privacy laws in place to protect people. The EU&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://eugdpr.org/\">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</a> is a step in the right direction, as it&rsquo;s designed to protect and empower all EU citizens when it comes to their data privacy.</p>\n<p>However, there���s more that can be done to protect your privacy online. Reach out to your politicians and local representatives to let them know how much online privacy matters to you. Use your votes to show them that you want your data kept private.</p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 15 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":10468,"bgimg":"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/privacy-badger-webinar/header.png","linkMd5":"2ab462908ae078839300a392cb5b5bca","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn45@2020_5/2020/08/25/00-54-52-913_7d6337a8000f6945.webp","destWidth":2080,"destHeight":800,"sourceBytes":42628,"destBytes":45168,"author":"Sarah Brown","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/privacy-badger-webinar/header.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn45@2020_5/2020/08/25/00-54-52-913_7d6337a8000f6945.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598316891415},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:54:51","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:54:51","title":"Get to know 1Password Advanced Protection with our next webinar","link":"https://blog.1password.com/advanced-protection-webinar/","description":"\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/advanced-protection-webinar/header.png' class='webfeedsFeaturedVisual' alt='Get to know 1Password Advanced Protection with our next webinar' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p class=\"introduction\">We���ve just launched <a href=\"https://blog.1password.com/introducing-advanced-protection/\">1Password Advanced Protection</a>, a suite of powerful new security tools for <a href=\"https://1password.com/business/\">1Password Business</a>, and we���re excited to show you what it can do.</p>\n<p>Join us on September 24th or October 8th at 2 p.m. EDT, when we���ll show you how to create security policies, prevent threats, and monitor your team���s access in 1Password Business.</p>\n<p>In this live webinar, you&rsquo;ll learn how to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Set a Master Password policy</li>\n<li>Turn on two-factor authentication for the team</li>\n<li>Create and manage firewall rules</li>\n<li>Monitor your team&rsquo;s sign-in attempts</li>\n<li>Set and manage software update requirements</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We���ll also have time for a Q&amp;A session at the end to answer all your questions about Advanced Protection.</p>\n<p>Join the webinar on either <a href=\"https://1password.zoom.us/webinar/register/2815663317355/WN_O_vq2cR5Tyayb2o-zxib_A\">September 24th</a> or <a href=\"https://1password.zoom.us/webinar/register/6815665001720/WN_DDGaBohIRNWvuRm3qhwHIg\">October 8th</a> at 2 p.m. It&rsquo;s free, and it&rsquo;s a great way to get to know Advanced Protection.</p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 18 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":10468,"bgimg":"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/advanced-protection-webinar/header.png","linkMd5":"8abb7e31a4cc6b25a7217403efd2dad6","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn29@2020_4/2020/08/25/00-54-53-853_c026a56294acd613.webp","destWidth":2080,"destHeight":800,"sourceBytes":49476,"destBytes":48894,"author":"Sarah Brown","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/advanced-protection-webinar/header.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn29@2020_4/2020/08/25/00-54-53-853_c026a56294acd613.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598316891415},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:54:51","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:54:51","title":"AGConf[9]: Adventures on the high seas","link":"https://blog.1password.com/agconf9-adventures-on-the-high-seas/","description":"\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/agconf9/header.png' class='webfeedsFeaturedVisual' alt='AGConf[9]: Adventures on the high seas' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p class=\"introduction\">One of the challenges as a remote company is that we���re scattered all across the world, which makes it difficult to meet in person. That&rsquo;s why all of us at 1Password eagerly look forward to our annual meetup, AGConf, which is held each winter on a cruise ship in the Caribbean.</p>\n<p>We met up in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Many of us were escaping cold and snow back home, and what better way to soak up the sun than to spend a week aboard Royal Caribbean&rsquo;s <em>Independence of the Seas</em> ��� with stops in Nassau, Haiti, and Jamaica?</p>\n<h2 id=\"pre-cruise-hangouts\">Pre-cruise hangouts</h2>\n<p>With people coming in from overseas, one even as far as New Zealand, a lot of folks like to get to Florida a day early. It helps them adjust to the time zone and get a good night���s sleep on land before venturing onto the boat.</p>\n<p>One group met up to get dinner and drinks at a tiki bar, another group went out in search of excellent Cuban sandwiches, and a lot of people just hung out in small groups in their hotel lobbies. It was a great way to meet up with old friends, and for the newbies to ease into the madness before it kicked up a notch the next day.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1password-continues-to-grow\">1Password continues to grow</h2>\n<p>Since I only joined 1Password last August, this was my first AGConf, and I was very excited to meet people in person and put faces to the names I���d been talking to over Slack for months. And while it may have been my first meetup, it was clear from looking at last year&rsquo;s photos just how much we&rsquo;d grown since AGConf[8]!</p>\n<p>There were so many of us that we took over a large portion of the top deck when we gathered there after boarding. We all wore our 1Password shirts so it was easy to spot everyone. As the ship pulled away from the port, we spread out on lounge chairs to chat, grabbed drinks at the bar, and snagged hugs from friends old and new.</p>\n<section class=\"gallery\">\n<figure itemprop=\"associatedMedia\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\" class=\"item item-row3-column3\">\n<meta itemprop=\"contentUrl\" content=\"/posts/2019/agconf9/gallery-1/agconf-5.jpg\" />\n<img itemprop=\"thumbnail\" src=\"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/agconf9/gallery-1/agconf-5-thumb.jpg\" alt=\"AGConf9\" style='max-width: 100px;

We heard from our CEO Jeff Shiner, founders Dave and Sara, and of course our head of security Jeff Goldberg. We celebrated our successes from 2018 and discussed what���s on the horizon for 2019. We even recorded an episode of <a href=\"https://blog.1password.com/random-but-memorable-the-security-advice-podcast-from-1password/\">Random but Memorable</a> right there on the ship! It was encouraging and exciting to hear about the great stuff we have planned and what we���ll be doing to reach our goals.</p>\n<h2 id=\"fun-off-and-on-the-ship\">Fun off and on the ship</h2>\n<p>When we���d wrap up with work for the day, there were plenty of other adventures to be had. We got dressed in our fanciest clothes for formal night. There were quite a few ���Bits that discovered a love ��� and talent ��� for karaoke, hitting up the open mic sessions nearly every time they were available. Quite a few people brought games, and we spent some late nights in an empty conference room playing Resistance, Unstable Unicorns, Codewords, and more. No matter where you found yourself, there was sure to be plenty of laughter.</p>\n<p>Sara and Maria also managed to book us time in the onboard escape room and laser tag area, which were both huge hits. In the escape room on the top deck, ���Bits worked together to solve puzzles and beat the clock to break free. Meanwhile, on the bottom deck, a group of us battled hard at laser tag, creeping around the course and trying to catch the opposing team off-guard.</p>\n<section class=\"gallery\">\n<figure itemprop=\"associatedMedia\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\" class=\"item item-row3-column3\">\n<meta itemprop=\"contentUrl\" content=\"/posts/2019/agconf9/gallery-3/agconf-26.jpg\" />\n<img itemprop=\"thumbnail\" src=\"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/agconf9/gallery-3/agconf-26-thumb.jpg\" alt=\"AGConf9\" style='max-width: 100px;

The brain analyzes webpages in the background so it can suggest relevant items to fill in the available fields.</p>\n<p>In 1Password X 1.17, we&rsquo;ve completely rewritten the brain in <a href=\"https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/book/\">Rust and WebAssembly</a>. Rust gives us a boost in both speed and portability - making it smarter, faster, and more embeddable in all our apps.</p>\n<p>Not to get too technical on you, but we&rsquo;re now using Rust libraries to power many parts of the extension, including all <a href=\"https://support.1password.com/markdown/\">Markdown parsing</a> and <a href=\"https://support.1password.com/one-time-passwords/\">time-based one-time password (TOTP) generation</a>. By taking advantage of Rust&rsquo;s ability to compile to WebAssembly, we can now share this implementation across all of our apps.</p>\n<h2 id=\"new-inline-menu\">New inline menu</h2>\n<p>The inline menu gives you autofill suggestions as you browse the web, and now it&rsquo;s faster than ever. With a single click, you can use &ldquo;Hide on this page&rdquo; to stop the inline icon and menu from appearing on specific pages. When you&rsquo;re ready for it to show up again, just restart your browser.</p>\n<p>We also make things easier for people with multiple Google accounts. When signing in to Google, all Login items with a matching username are automatically sorted to the top.</p>\n<h2 id=\"accessibility\">Accessibility</h2>\n<p>We want everyone to be able to access their accounts with ease. That&rsquo;s why we followed the web accessibility spec defined by <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/\">WAI-ARIA, the Accessible Rich Internet Applications Suite</a> when we rewrote the inline menu. WAI-ARIA works to establish the best way to create web content and web applications to make them more accessible to people with disabilities.</p>\n<p>Here are the accessibility improvements in 1Password X:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>List item selector</strong>. Use your keyboard to open the item list selector from anywhere within the pop-up.</li>\n<li><strong>Screen reader support</strong>. We let screen readers know 1Password is available by stating &ldquo;1Password menu available. Press the down arrow key to select,&rdquo; when focusing in a field, selecting items, or changing the list type.</li>\n<li><strong>List navigation</strong>. Easily navigate the item list and item list selector using your keyboard. For example, pressing &ldquo;Home&rdquo; will select the first item in the list.</li>\n<li><strong>Type-ahead support</strong>. Both lists now support type-ahead, which allows you to start typing in the field and see the suggested items pop up for selection.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"get-the-update-today\">Get the update today</h2>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re a 1Password X user, you already have this update. Open your browser and enjoy!</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re new to 1Password X, you can download and install it from the <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/1password-x-%E2%80%93-password-ma/aeblfdkhhhdcdjpifhhbdiojplfjncoa\">Chrome Web Store</a> (supports Chrome, Chromium, Brave, Vivaldi, Opera, and Microsoft Edge) or the <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1password-x-password-manager/?src=search\">Firefox Add-ons Gallery</a>, where we are one of <a href=\"https://blog.1password.com/mozilla-extensions-program/\">Mozilla&rsquo;s Recommended Extensions</a>.</p>\n<p>You can also <a href=\"https://discussions.agilebits.com/discussion/79610/how-to-install-1password-x-beta-in-chrome\">join our beta</a> to be the first to enjoy new features as we add them.

We���re calling for CEOs to step up to protect their business. All it takes is a conversation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-ceo-fraud\">What is CEO fraud?</h2>\n<p>1Password (like many others) have experienced a recent spate of phishing attempts. The team received emails from an attacker pretending to be me, asking for personal information. Although the scam wasn���t successful at 1Password, businesses all over the world have been less fortunate.</p>\n<p>CEO fraud is a form of BEC (Business Email Compromise). An attacker spoofs the email address of the CEO or poses as them in an email. In the message, they ask an employee to transfer money to an account they control, or to provide personal or financial information.</p>\n<p>Often, the message will invoke a sense of urgency and put pressure on employees to act quickly. Here���s a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-49857948\">real example</a> that resulted in USD$8million going missing.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;Hey, the deal is done. Please wire USD$8 million to this account to finalise the acquisition ASAP. Needs to be done before the end of the day. Thanks.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If employees are in the middle of an important deal or eager to impress you, it���s easy to see how something like this could catch them off guard.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ceo-fraud-comes-in-different-forms\">CEO fraud comes in different forms</h2>\n<p>In the example above, the email came from the CEO���s spoofed email address, and the attacker knew that a real deal was underway.</p>\n<p>Often, this type of attack will have a different reply-to address, tricking an unwitting member of staff into sending valuable information to the person running the fraud. In some cases, the domain is just one or two characters different from the real company email address.</p>\n<p>Other attacks have been successful using just the name of the CEO. The email comes from a generic email address (Gmail, Yahoo, and so on.), set up to look like the personal email of the CEO. Although the scam has many guises, it is essentially the same. A member of staff receives an email, signed by someone important, asking for something valuable.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/mediacenter/security/fake-emails-avoid-risks/\">60% of emails</a> involved in BEC scams don���t contain a link, so it���s difficult for security systems to detect them. Your team is your best defense. Everyone needs to be on the alert, but finance, HR, and executives are the most likely targets.</p>\n<h2 id=\"its-for-time-ceos-to-take-action\">It���s for time CEOs to take action</h2>\n<p>We���re campaigning to raise awareness of CEO fraud in a bid to tackle it head-on, and we���re calling for CEOs to commit to doing the same. Your authority and influence have the power to really make a difference here.</p>\n<p>You need to have a conversation with your employees. Let them know that you will never ask them to make a payment or to send personal information over email. When your employees are armed with the knowledge of how to spot and stop fraud, they���re much less likely to be manipulated into complying.</p>\n<p>To help, we���ve put together a template to send your employees or use to guide meetings with your teams.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Dear team,</p>\n<p>To tighten our security and protect our business, I���m writing to you to highlight a scam that���s costing businesses billions: CEO fraud.</p>\n<p>We, as a team, are our best line of defense against such attacks, so please take a moment to read this carefully.</p>\n<p><strong>What is CEO fraud?</strong></p>\n<p>CEO fraud is when an attacker impersonates the CEO or another high-level executive via email to request either a payment or the transmission of personal or financial information. The email may come from my company email address, an email address very similar to mine, or one that looks like a personal email. For example, CEO fraud could come from an email address like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"highlight\">ceoname@companydomain.com</span>\n</li>\n<li><span class=\"highlight\">ceoname@companyname1.com</span>\n</li>\n<li><span class=\"highlight\">ceoname@gmail.com</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Example CEO fraud emails</strong></p>\n<p>���Please pay USD$10,000 to this account to finalize the deal I���ve been working on. This needs to be done by the end of the day. Thank you for your help.���</p>\n<p>���I���ve forgotten the password and have been locked out of our banking system. Please send me the password ASAP as I need to close a deal today.���</p>\n<p><strong>What you can do about it</strong></p>\n<p>If you get an email from myself or someone else in the company asking you to make a payment or send confidential information, question it. If you are unsure, ask the person who sent it either in person (if possible) or via another channel (phone, instant messenger) if the email is legitimate.</p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"highlight\"> Report anything suspicious to [name] [email@domain.com].</span>\n</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Most importantly, I will never ask you for the following in an email:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>For you to make a payment</li>\n<li>Your own or company payment details (credit card numbers, bank details, and so on.)</li>\n<li>Passwords, verification codes, or secret answers</li>\n<li>Personally identifiable information (phone number, personal email address, date of birth)</li>\n<li>To follow a link to sign in to a bank account</li>\n<li>For you to purchase iTunes or Google Play gift cards</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>If you ever get an email like this from me, report it immediately.</strong></p>\n<p>Thank you for your support in securing our business and protecting our employees.</p>\n<p>Regards</p>\n<span class=\"highlight\">[CEO name]</span>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"make-it-a-company-wide-effort\">Make it a company-wide effort</h2>\n<p>CEOs are valuable targets, and it&rsquo;s vital that they lead the charge against this scam. But they&rsquo;re not the only people in your organization vulnerable to Business Email Compromise. It could happen to anyone.</p>\n<p>To defend against this fraud in all its forms, make it company policy to never ask for this type of information in an email and provide training on the subject as part of your onboarding process. That way you���ll be protecting your employees from day one.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/mediacenter/security/fake-emails-avoid-risks/\">91% of all cyberattacks</a> start with phishing, so although the focus is on spotting suspicious emails, it���s also a good time to go over the basics of spotting all types of phishing with your team.</p>\n<p>When employees feel confident and empowered when it comes to security, they���re more likely to make better decisions and spot scams. Remind them of the following good email security practices:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Always question the legitimacy of any email. If something feels suspicious double-check with the sender. Ideally, check in person. If you can���t, call or instant message them.</li>\n<li>Never reply to a request for personal information (for example, your Social Security number, phone number, home address) via email.</li>\n<li>Never send payment details, bank details, or passwords in an email.\nIf someone sends you a link that takes you to a login screen, go to the website some other way (for example, via Google search, or by typing in the URL).</li>\n<li>Always scrutinize the email address of the sender, links, any URL you are directed to or attachments you weren���t expecting.</li>\n<li>Be especially cautious of emails that trigger a warning banner or message.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We hope that you will join us in raising awareness of CEO fraud and Business Email Compromise. The more we talk about it, the less effective it becomes. All it takes is a quick email, or better yet, a training session, to equip your team with the knowledge they need to stop this underhanded scheme in its tracks.</p>\n<section class=\"c-call-to-action-box c-call-to-action-box--background-author\">\n<div class=\"c-call-to-action-box__author\">\n<img src=\"https://blog.1password.com/img/authors/jeffshiner.jpg\" class=\"c-call-to-action-box__author-image\" alt=\"Jeff Shiner\"/>\n</div>\n<div class=\"c-call-to-action-box__content\">\n<h3 class=\"c-call-to-action-box__title\">Get more security tips</h3>\n<div class=\"c-call-to-action-box__text\">\nSign up to our business security mailing list and get advice on running a secure, productive workplace delivered directly to your inbox.\n</div>\n<form accept-charset=\"UTF-8\" action=\"https://agilemail.createsend.com/t/r/s/ohlyduj/\" class=\"oneline\" data-event-category=\"Newsletter\" data-event-action=\"form-newsletter\" id=\"newsletterForm\" method=\"post\">\n<div id=\"hidden-fields\"><input name=\"utf8\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"���\"><input name=\"authenticity_token\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"B2cHFMPBG0KjOnROQ884zCYcI0afwrAx897/qCCfum0=\"></div>\n<input class=\"c-call-to-action-box__newsletter-email\" id=\"cm-ohlyduj-ohlyduj\" name=\"cm-ohlyduj-ohlyduj\" type=\"email\" placeholder=\"wendy@appleseed.com\">\n<input class=\"c-call-to-action-box__newsletter-button\" type=\"submit\" value=\"Sign up\">\n</form>\n</div>\n</section>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 20 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":10468,"bgimg":"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/ceo-fraud/header.png","linkMd5":"fb9ca7bab32f686a00e8f56e09a55c84","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn42@2020_3/2020/08/25/00-54-52-256_769aaca8f829dfdd.webp","destWidth":2080,"destHeight":800,"sourceBytes":34575,"destBytes":43918,"author":"Jeff Shiner","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/ceo-fraud/header.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn42@2020_3/2020/08/25/00-54-52-256_769aaca8f829dfdd.webp","https://blog.1password.com/img/authors/jeffshiner.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn94@2020_2/2020/08/25/00-54-58-584_836257a2e780b371.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598316891415},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:54:51","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:54:51","title":"Introducing 1Password for Democracy","link":"https://blog.1password.com/introducing-1password-for-democracy/","description":"\n<img src='https://blog.1password.com/posts/2018/democracy/header.png' class='webfeedsFeaturedVisual' alt='Introducing 1Password for Democracy' style='max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;' />\n<p class=\"introduction\">The last couple of years have been politically turbulent, whatever your views, and whichever country you find yourself in.
