In addition, the study examined the unique contributions of technology uses after factoring out demographics, anxiety and attitudes. Teens, young adults and adults (N = 1143) completed an anonymous, online questionnaire that assessed these variables. Each disorder had a unique set of predictors with 17 of the 22 significant predictors being Facebook general use, impression management and friendship. More Facebook friends predicted more clinical symptoms of bipolar-mania, narcissism and histrionic personality disorder but fewer symptoms of dysthymia and schizoid personality disorder. Technology-related attitudes and anxieties significantly predicted clinical symptoms of the disorders. After factoring out attitudes and anxiety, Facebook and selected technology uses predicted clinical symptoms with Facebook use, impression management and friendship being the best predictors. The results showed both positive and negative aspects of technology including social media as well as apparently detrimental effects of a preference for multitasking.</p></blockquote>\n<p>via <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563212003172\">ScienceDirect.com &#8211; Computers in Human Behavior &#8211; Is Facebook creating “iDisorders”?
