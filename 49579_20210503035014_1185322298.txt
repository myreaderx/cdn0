The current quenching of the charge trap is effectively compensated by the turn‐on voltage shift, which achieves an ultrahigh detectivity of up to 10<sup>17</sup> Jones.\n\n\n</p>\n<br/>\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>In phototransistors, the photovoltaic‐induced current is proportional to the turn‐on voltage shift and the total number of trapped charges. However, it is challenging to obtain a high turn‐on voltage shift simply by using minority carrier trap sites because high‐concentration carrier trap sites introduce strong current traps and carrier recombination. In this study, spatially separated, hole/electron, dual traps are introduced into a phototransistor, demonstrating the possibility of combining hole and electron traps without and with illumination, respectively, to obtain a large turn‐on voltage shift. The near‐infrared phototransistor demonstrates a high light‐to‐dark current ratio (1 × 10<sup>6</sup>) alongside a turn‐on voltage shift of 28 V. The current quenching of the charge trap is effectively compensated by the threshold voltage shift, resulting in an increase of the drain–source current. The dual traps induce a low‐noise current and a high photoresponsivity (5.26 × 10<sup>3</sup> A W<sup>–1</sup>) under the same gate voltage (<i>V</i>\n<sub>g</sub> = 0 V), exhibiting an ultrahigh detectivity (D1/f∗ = 1.88 × 10<sup>15</sup> Jones; Dshot∗= 8.21 × 10<sup>16</sup> Jones).</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 06 Apr 2021 08:18:30 +0000","feedId":49579,"bgimg":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/3955c4e9-39c6-4857-9206-acf250606f3b/adom202002031-gra-0001-m.png","linkMd5":"fba496d45db6cab2a13aea7d0e67cfd4","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn56@2020_5/2021/05/03/03-50-13-892_9e48f8149e785198.webp","destWidth":394,"destHeight":311,"sourceBytes":36922,"destBytes":36922,"author":"\nMeihua Shou, \nQinglei Zhang, \nHao Li, \nShicheng Xiong, \nBangyao Hu, \nJiadong Zhou, \nNan Zheng, \nZengqi Xie, \nLei Ying, \nLinlin Liu\n","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/3955c4e9-39c6-4857-9206-acf250606f3b/adom202002031-gra-0001-m.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn56@2020_5/2021/05/03/03-50-13-892_9e48f8149e785198.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1620013752257}],"record":{"createdTime":"2021-05-03 11:49:12","updatedTime":"2021-05-03 11:49:12","feedId":49579,"fetchDate":"Mon, 03 May 2021 03:49:12 +0000","fetchMs":111,"handleMs":35,"totalMs":62099,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":86,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"4cf9ab886509ef3fd2ece0a16b714d9c","hostName":"europe-59*","requestId":"51d9e96e33af451da08ab8704825c786_49579","contentType":"application/xml; charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":36922,"bgimgsTotal":1,"bgimgsGithubTotal":1,"articlesImgsTotal":1,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":1,"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx30":1},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-09-07 03:53:23","updatedTime":"2020-09-07 06:11:25","id":49579,"name":"Wiley: Advanced Optical Materials: Table of Contents","url":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=21951071&type=etoc&feed=rss","subscriber":64,"website":null,"icon":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/pb-assets/journal-banners/21951071.jpg","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx61/cdn78@2020_6/2020/09/06/22-11-24-040_607d08fab4efbc23.jpg","description":"Table of Contents for Advanced Optical Materials.
