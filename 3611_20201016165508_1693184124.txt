Now imagine that the other person can’t see the object or image, so every detail matters. How do you decide what information is important and what’s not? You’ll need to know exactly what everything is, where it is, what it’s doing in relation to other objects, and note other attributes like color or position of objects in the foreground or background. This exercise shows there’s no question that translating images into words is a complex task—one humans do so often and innately it seems automatic at times—requiring a wide range of knowledge about many unique things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to translate this skill into artificial intelligence (AI), we need to carefully consider and adapt models to the deep relationships between words and objects, the way they interrelate in expected and unexpected ways, and how contexts like environment and pose of an object affect the subtleties of associating and understanding new objects within categories. In AI, this means exploring new ways of training models, untethered to traditional annotation-reliant methods that require sentence-image pairs. To this aim, researchers from the Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services team and Microsoft Research have created VIVO (Visual Vocabulary Pretraining), an image-captioning milestone that performs pretraining in the absence of caption annotations and results in new state-of-the-art performance on novel object captioning.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Refining vision and language pretraining for novel object captioning</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Novel object captioning (NOC) aims to generate image captions capable of describing novel objects that are not present in the caption training data. NOC can add value to a variety of applications, such as human-computer interaction and image-language understanding. However, NOC is a challenging problem as it requires a visual system to recognize novel objects, and it also needs a language model to generate fluent sentences describing the objects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recently, researchers have developed the <a href=\"https://nocaps.org/\">novel object captioning challenge (nocaps)</a> to evaluate NOC. In this challenge, existing computer vision techniques can be leveraged to recognize novel objects. For example, prior studies have proposed generating template sentences that are filled in with the recognized visual concepts from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_detection\">object detectors</a>. However, the captioning capability is limited by object detection vocabulary, and the context of objects can hardly be well described by pre-defined templates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vision and language pretraining (VLP) has shown to be effective for cross-modal representation learning. Prior works have explored training Transformer-based models on large amounts of image-sentence pairs. The learned cross-modal representations can be fine-tuned to improve the performance on image captioning, such as <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/expanding-scene-and-language-understanding-with-large-scale-pre-training-and-a-unified-architecture/\">VLP </a>and <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/objects-are-the-secret-key-to-revealing-the-world-between-vision-and-language/\">OSCAR</a>. However, these prior works rely on large amounts of image-sentence pairs for pretraining. When it comes to the nocaps challenge, where no additional paired image-sentence training data is allowed, none of the prior VLP techniques are readily applicable. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This blog post introduces VIVO, developed by the <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/\">Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services</a> team and Microsoft Research, which performs pretraining in the absence of caption annotations. By breaking the dependency of paired image-sentence training data in VLP, VIVO can leverage large-scale vision datasets with image-tag pairs in pretraining to learn cross-modality alignment, building a rich visual vocabulary at scale. Our discovery leads to a new captioning framework that creates <a href=\"https://evalai.cloudcv.org/web/challenges/challenge-page/355/leaderboard/1011\">new state-of-the-art performance on the nocaps benchmark</a> and surpasses human performance for the first time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Please check out our paper, titled “<a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/vivo-surpassing-human-performance-in-novel-object-captioning-with-visual-vocabulary-pre-training/\">VIVO: Surpassing Human Performance in Novel Object Captioning with Visual Vocabulary Pre-Training</a>,” for more details, and gain further insight into the researchers’ perspectives on how this breakthrough impacts caption generation in Azure AI and accessibility in this <a href=\"https://aka.ms/AA99bjt\">blog post</a> from The AI Blog. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"624\" height=\"361\" src=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2020/10/NOCAPS_Figure1.png\" alt=\"Three boxes are shown, one above and two below.

Note that the fine-tuning dataset only covers a subset of the most common objects in the learned visual vocabulary. Nevertheless, our model can still generalize to test images that contain a similar scene (like the people sitting on couches in Figure 1) with novel objects unseen in the fine-tuning dataset (like “accordion”), thanks to the visual vocabulary learned in the pretraining stage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our VIVO pretraining learns to ground the image regions to the object tags. In fine-tuning, our model learns how to compose natural language captions. The combined skill achieves the compositionality generalization, allowing for zero-shot captioning on novel objects.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"579\" src=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2020/10/Nocaps_figure2_updateres-1024x579.jpg\" alt=\"(a) Pretraining: learn visual vocabulary.

(c) During inference, given the image and detected tags, our model is applied iteratively to generate a sequence of words describing novel objects in an auto-regressive manner.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Our training scheme consists of three main stages as shown in Figure 2. In pretraining, we feed to a multi-layer Transformer model, with the input consisting of the image region features and the paired image-tag set. In these sets of tags, single images can have multiple tags associated with them. We then randomly mask one or more tags, and we ask the model to predict these masked tags, conditioned on the image region features and the other tags. Given that tags are not ordered, we develop a Hungarian matching loss for tag prediction.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"msr-promo--alignwide\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"msr-promo\" data-bi-area=\"promo\" data-bi-id=\"670821\"\n\t\t\t\tdata-bi-type=\"newsletter\">\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t<p class=\"msr-promo__label\">\n\t\t<span>Spotlight: Microsoft research newsletter</span>\n\t</p>\n\t\n\t<div class=\"msr-promo__inner-wrap\">\n\n\t\t<div class=\"msr-promo__block\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"msr-promo__media\">\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://note.microsoft.com/ww-registration-microsoft-research-newsletter-s.html?wt.mc_id=S-webpage_msr-homepage\" data-bi-name=\"Microsoft Research Newsletter\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2019/09/Newsletter_Banner_08_2019_v1_1920x1080.png\" alt=\"\" />\n\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<div class=\"msr-promo__content \">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2 class=\"msr-promo__heading\">Microsoft Research Newsletter</h2>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"msr-promo__message\">Stay connected to the research community at Microsoft.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-buttons\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-fill-chevron\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://note.microsoft.com/ww-registration-microsoft-research-newsletter-s.html?wt.mc_id=S-webpage_msr-homepage\" class=\"wp-block-button__link\" data-bi-name=\"Microsoft Research Newsletter\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSubscribe today\t\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><!--/.msr-promo__content-->\n\t\t</div><!--/.msr-promo__block-->\n\t</div><!--/.msr-promo__inner-wrap-->\n\n\t\t\t</div><!--/.msr-promo-->\n\t\t\t</div><!--/.msr-promo--alignwide-->\n\t\t\n\n\n\n<p>After pretraining, the Transformer model is fine-tuned on a dataset where both captions and tags are available, like the <a href=\"https://cocodataset.org/#home\">COCO dataset</a> with 80 object classes and caption annotations.
