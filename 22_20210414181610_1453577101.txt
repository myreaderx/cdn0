F-35B squadrons and detachments of multi-role helicopters suited to different types of sea warfare missions.</p><p>&#34;The most challenging problem of the PLA is a lack of new-generation fixed-wing

capacity of its US$13 billion nuclear-powered supercarriers known as CVNs, but cost half as much or even less, Forbes reported in December.</p><p>The ARG operation could be seen as testing a

It starts in the morning when Featherstone opens his eyes and catches Goggins&#39; thousand-yard stare from the book jacket of &#34;Can&#39;t Hurt Me,&#34; Goggins&#39; memoir, on his nightstand.</p><p>Throughout the day, Featherstone, 36, a firefighter and an avid runner in Calgary, Alberta, ingests YouTube videos and podcast clips of the former Navy SEAL and ultramarathoner, who reminds him to &#34;Stay hard!&#34; And as night falls, and Featherstone crawls back into bed beside his wife, there Goggins remains on the nightstand - inert, gazing blankly into the darkness.</p><p>Featherstone acknowledges the reality plainly: &#34;David Goggins is in my head daily.&#34;</p><p>The sway that Goggins, who is 46, has over his followers - his ability to occupy their thoughts and persuade them to push past their limits - is hard to overstate. Last month, he oversaw the Goggins Challenge, a two-day test of physical fitness that ran March 5-7. Across 90 countries, tens of thousands of weekend warriors ran four miles every four hours, for 48 hours straight. If you weren&#39;t a runner, you exercised. If you weren&#39;t a gym rat, you just got sweaty. It was free to enter, and if you wanted a T-shirt, you paid $35.</p><p>Devin Featherstone did it in full firefighter gear because why not.</p><p>While Goggins ended up donating more than $200,000 in profits from the T-shirt sales to charity, for individual people there is still no good reason to do challenges like these. But Goggins regularly inspires such action. Drawing on stories of his difficult past, mixed with expletive-ridden calls to reject creature comforts, he&#39;s found a way to become equal parts drill sergeant, life coach, and superhero for his community of nearly <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/davidgoggins/?hl=en\">4 million</a> highly engaged Instagram followers.</p><p>&#34;It&#39;s just really empowering,&#34; said Jenny Petersen, a 48-year-old nurse and runner from Lincoln, Nebraska, speaking of Goggins&#39; list of accomplishments. Petersen - a runner and triathlete - was among those who completed the Goggins Challenge. &#34;People are starting to embrace that it&#39;s OK if you suffer, and that you&#39;re tougher than you think.&#34;</p><p>After more than a year of both mental and physical anguish wrought by COVID-19, Goggins&#39; calls to embrace discomfort may seem ill-timed. But for the newly converted and die-hards alike, he&#39;s offering people more than motivation: an opportunity to reclaim control of their suffering, and practice it on their own terms.</p><p>Goggins&#39; fan base is growing fast, and there are promising signs his ability to monetize that interest - through a bestselling memoir, corporate speaking engagements, merchandise, and avenues yet-to-be explored - could carve out a lucrative &#34;business of toughness&#34; over the coming years.</p><p>&#34;I discovered a whole nother part of your fucking brain that a lot of people don&#39;t even know about,&#34; Goggins told Joe Rogan in a <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/episode/70ssh8DCCOlwwOEAjLobW3?si=k0g4Ym4hTIulmEA2Tsl7mw\">2018 podcast episode</a>. &#34;It&#39;s my job now to take these weak people, in the category that I was in, and say, &#39;Uh-uh. Stop reading the bullshit. Stop listening to the bullshit.&#39; And if my story of success can impact somebody, it is my job, it is my duty, to share the story.&#34; (Goggins declined to be interviewed for this article.)</p><h2><strong>Achievements born from adversity</strong></h2><p class=\"drop-cap\">It was November 1, 2005, and a 6-foot-2, 245-pound linebacker of a Navy SEAL was on the starting line of a 24-hour footrace in Southern California. Goggins had signed up for the San Diego 1-Day, an event he entered as a qualifying race for a separate ultramarathon in which he hoped to raise money for charity.</p><p>He was no fleet-footed runner. In the lead-up to the race, Goggins&#39; cardiovascular training included just 20 minutes spent on the elliptical every Sunday. The task ahead of him: Complete 100 laps of the one-mile track before the 24 hours were up.</p><p>The race nearly broke Goggins, who describes the hellacious experience in his book and on podcasts as the most painful day of his life. He broke all the small bones in his feet. His kidneys shut down. By the time he got home, having run 101 miles in under 19 hours, he was smeared with blood, urine, and feces, and was unable to walk under his own weight. His wife at the time begged him to go to the hospital.</p><p>&#34;She kept talking, shouting, crying, trying to reach me through the haze,&#34; Goggins wrote in his 2018 memoir, &#34;Can&#39;t Hurt Me: Master Your Mind and Defy the Odds.&#34; &#34;And I heard most of what she said, but I knew if we went to the hospital they&#39;d give me pain killers and I didn&#39;t want to mask this pain. I&#39;d just accomplished the most amazing feat in my entire life.&#34;</p><bi-shortcode class=\"mceNonEditable\" data-type=\"image-spread\" data-image-count=\"3\"><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/606cb09870954f0019195765?format=jpeg\" alt=\"brent gleeson &#38; david goggins\" height=\"825\" width=\"1099\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Navy SEAL training in 2001.

In 2006, he completed seven more races of 30 miles or more. In 2007, he completed 14 more, including a third-place finish at the Badwater 135, a race longer than five normal marathons that cuts through the sneaker-melting heat of Death Valley. He&#39;s completed two dozen more ultras in the 14 years since.</p><p>Goggins has also competed in the Ironman World Championship, finishing the 140.6-mile triathlon in 11 hours and 24 minutes. And in 2013, he broke the Guinness World Record for most pullups completed in 24 hours with 4,030. He broke the record with seven hours to spare.</p><p>For people such as Petersen and Featherstone, Goggins&#39; core appeal is his mental toughness, which Goggins said he channels into <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B0jC_nzns2X/\">&#34;going the distance,&#34;</a> not winning the race. He speaks often of the &#34;40% rule,&#34; which says that when people typically give up, they&#39;re really only 40% depleted.</p><p>&#34;The reason it&#39;s so powerful,&#34; Goggins wrote in &#34;Can&#39;t Hurt Me,&#34; &#34;is that if you follow it, you will unlock your mind to new levels of performance and excellence in sports and in life, and your rewards will run far deeper than mere material success.&#34;</p><p>The San Diego 1-Day marked Goggins&#39; first step on the road to becoming an endurance athlete, but overcoming adversity stretches back to his childhood. Growing up Black in the small, predominantly white town of Brazil, Indiana, he faced virulent racism and struggled with a learning disability, speech impediment, and low self-esteem.</p><p>&#34;I damn sure wasn&#39;t going to get into college based on academics,&#34; Goggins wrote in &#34;Can&#39;t Hurt Me.&#34; &#34;All I knew was that I had to get the fuck out of Brazil, Indiana.&#34; He saw the military as his best chance and took the requisite entrance exam three times. On his third try, he met the minimum standard for the Air Force.</p><p>To date, Goggins is the only person to complete training as a Navy SEAL, Army Ranger, and Air Force Tactical Air Controller. And &#34;when that glory faded,&#34; about 20 years ago, Goggins set his sights on ultramarathon running, said Brent Gleeson, a former Navy SEAL who graduated from SEAL training with Goggins in 2001.</p><p>&#34;He&#39;s always striving, as he would say, to recertify himself as a savage,&#34; said Gleeson, who is now an entrepreneur and the author of several books, including &#34;Embrace the Suck: The Navy SEAL Way to an Extraordinary Life.&#34; &#34;It&#39;s that continual journey, and I think that inadvertently started to spark something in other people.&#34;</p><p>Even in middle age, Goggins seems to have no plans of slowing down. In October, at 45 years old, he ran 238 miles in 62 hours, 21 minutes, and 29 seconds as part of the Moab 240 in Utah. It was good enough for a second-place finish.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/606cb1f570954f0019195778?format=jpeg\" alt=\"David Goggins by Brandon Rogers:US Navy\" height=\"1391\" width=\"1855\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Goggins ran the Badwater 135 in 2007, in a string of 14 ultramarathon races that year.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Brandon Rogers/US Navy</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><h2><strong>Not just transformation - multiplication</strong></h2><p>But now the 46-year-old veteran is increasingly turning his attention toward brand-building. In 2016, Goggins, along with his team, founded Goggins LLC as a way to start investing in himself, as he told Rogan on his first of two podcast appearances.</p><p>&#34;I try to be as real as I can,&#34; Goggins said, &#34;because we&#39;re all fucking suffering in this world. We&#39;re all hurting. And I try to take away all titles you wanna give me to let you know that I did not come from that shit. That&#39;s why I have to be so authentic and so real about my own insecurities and my own faults, and being a fucked-up person.&#34;</p><p>Influencers strive to be as authentic as possible; it can <a href=\"https://blog.hootsuite.com/authentic-social-media/\">make or break</a> a nascent brand. Fortunately for Goggins, who may never even use the word &#34;influencer,&#34; staying true to himself and his story has been the greatest source of his success - and sometimes his stress.</p><p>&#34;My biggest fear in life is, people can read right through a motherfucker that&#39;s not real,&#34; he told Rogan. &#34;I do it all the time. A lot of people have these great quotes, and they mass-produce. I can&#39;t mass-produce something, man.&#34;</p><p>Instead, he&#39;s started giving talks. He&#39;s spoken at companies such as Cisco and Microsoft and at pro sports teams such as the Seattle Seahawks and the New York Giants. (Because of COVID-19, he has not given a talk since March 2020, a spokesperson confirmed.) Clips from these talks carry titles such as &#34;Stop Talking Yourself Out of Being Great&#34; and &#34;Get Comfortable With Being Uncomfortable.&#34;</p><p>There is ample room for Goggins to grow in these spaces: Together, the <a href=\"https://blog.marketresearch.com/the-10-billion-self-improvement-market-adjusts-to-new-generation\">self-improvement</a> and <a href=\"https://blog.marketresearch.com/u.s.-motivational-speaking-market-worth-1.9-billion\">motivational-speaking</a> markets are worth about $15 billion. And they are expected to grow between 4% and 6% over the next few years, according to research from Marketdata Enterprises.</p><p>In 2018, he and his co-author, Adam Skolnick, self-published his memoir, &#34;Can&#39;t Hurt Me.&#34; He said in a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/NickJamesExpertEmpires/videos/845740925804974/\">2019 Facebook Live event</a> that, despite being offered an advance of $300,000, he turned it down &#34;at the last minute&#34; and decided instead to invest $800,000 of his own money in self-publishing. (Goggins&#39; press representative did not respond to Insider&#39;s request to confirm these figures.)</p><p>&#34;It was the best decision, business-wise, I ever made in my entire life,&#34; Goggins said in the event, &#34;because I had the mental toughness and also the ability to know what was right for me and my brand.&#34;</p><p>The book ended up selling 900,000 copies across print and digital within the first four months, Deadline&#39;s Patrick Hipes <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2019/04/david-goggins-cant-hurt-me-hollywood-agency-wme-1202604800/\">reported</a>. It stayed on The New York Times&#39; bestseller list for 14 weeks and has sold more than 3 million copies to date. According to Bookscan data, roughly 300,000 of those copies are from the two bound editions.</p><p>&#34;That&#39;s spectacular for any book,&#34; said Giles Anderson, the owner and founder of Anderson Literary Agency.</p><p>Still, even as a businessman, Goggins is adamant that money isn&#39;t what gets him up in the morning. &#34;I&#39;m not driven by the business,&#34; he told Rogan. &#34;I&#39;m a minimalist motherfucker. Gimme a backpack, a fucking ground to sleep on, a pullup bar, some fucking running shoes, and a Subway sandwich, and I&#39;m fucking straight.&#34;</p><p>To be sure, Goggins isn&#39;t the only tough-as-nails influencer. Plenty have come before him, Tony Robbins perhaps looming the largest, literally, over the past two decades. Nor is Goggins the only veteran turned life coach to break onto the scene in recent years.</p><p>Jocko Willink is a retired naval officer, a podcaster, and the author of several books, including &#34;Extreme Ownership: How Navy SEALs Lead and Win.&#34; Willink is well known on Instagram, where he has nearly 2 million followers, for posting gritty, black-and-white close-ups of his digital watch displaying ungodly wake-up times. A recent photo <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CNFOaKlDQ8u/\">showed the time</a> as 4:25:41. The caption: &#34;WARPATH.&#34;</p><p>Many of Goggins&#39; followers also find strength in Jocko, as he&#39;s better known. But where Jocko has posted more than 4,700 times, Goggins has just 335 posts to his name, and each one is a viral sensation in its own right. His videos regularly pull in more than a million views.</p><p>To retired SEAL Gleeson, who previously founded and ran a digital-media agency for 11 years, the growth and engagement Goggins has achieved are nothing short of anomalous. &#34;I&#39;ve never seen an explosion of rapid growth from a social-media-brand standpoint,&#34; Gleeson said. &#34;Never seen it before.&#34;</p><bi-shortcode class=\"mceNonEditable\" data-type=\"image-spread\" data-image-count=\"2\"><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/606cb53e70954f00191957aa?format=jpeg\" alt=\"david goggins moab 240\" height=\"1160\" width=\"890\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Goggins ran the Moab 240 in October, finishing second.\n<p class=\"copyright\">David Goggins/Instagram</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure> <figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/606cb56070954f00191957ac?format=jpeg\" alt=\"david goggins moab 240\" height=\"1120\" width=\"908\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Goggins&#39; finishing time at the Moab 240 was 62 hours, 21 minutes.\n<p class=\"copyright\">David Goggins/Instagram</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></bi-shortcode><h2><strong>Goggins isn&#39;t for everyone … yet</strong></h2><p>Part of Goggins&#39; appeal has been the mythic quality that&#39;s followed him ever since stories began to surface on YouTube about six years ago. In 2015, the entrepreneur Jesse Itzler published &#34;Living With a SEAL: 31 Days Training With the Toughest Man on the Planet.&#34; Itzler never used the SEAL&#39;s name in the book, but word soon got out that the &#34;toughest man&#34; was in fact David Goggins. More videos emerged; rumors swirled. <em>Have you heard of David Goggins?</em> The man himself began appearing on podcasts, news shows, and social media.</p><p>All that organic growth has created a reputation that some find intriguing. For instance, a month after the official Goggins Challenge weekend in March, <a href=\"https://www.runnersworld.com/runners-stories/a36048798/zac-clark-david-goggins-48-hour-challenge/\">a handful of New York City-based runners</a> embarked on the challenge to raise money for charity the weekend of April 9. For others, who may be landing on Goggins&#39; Instagram page for the first time, the catalog of running videos, in which our hero yells at the camera for a minute straight, may seem intimidating. But for every Goggins nonbeliever, there is often a friend close by who&#39;s ready to dispel the myths and spread the gospel.</p><p>Joelle Tomlinson, a morning-news host in Calgary, and a friend of Featherstone, regularly runs ultramarathons. When she came across Goggins, in 2020, by way of a running partner, she first thought, &#34;Wow, this guy is absolutely wild&#34; - in a good way, she said. &#34;I&#39;ve never heard of anyone like this. I think he has completely made this recreational suffering more achievable.&#34; She said she was eager to pick up a copy of his book.</p><p>But then there are people such as Jacy Cunningham, a 32-year-old professional trainer in Maryland, who admire Goggins for his intensity but find less value in glorifying it as a way of life. &#34;Our society promotes pure extreme,&#34; said Cunningham, who runs his own business on a holistic form of fitness called the Jacy Method. &#34;We&#39;re fanatic about crazy shit. We&#39;re big on pushing ourselves to crazy limits.&#34;</p><p>Devin Featherstone said an increasingly comfortable world is to blame. &#34;People are driving more toward that in-your-face attitude of how Goggins tells you straight up: If you&#39;re lazy, you&#39;re lazy. You&#39;re not candy-coating it, and I think more and more people need that.&#34;</p><p>Still, even a superfan such as Featherstone said he&#39;s motivated most by his family and his values, and that he taps the fearless warrior in his head only when times get tough. As a dad to a 5-year-old son, he knows the misery of a 4 a.m. wake-up. But after studying &#34;Can&#39;t Hurt Me&#34; and listening to clip after clip, Featherstone said cleaning a mess or settling a dispute doesn&#39;t seem so bad.</p><p>&#34;There are things that I would bitch and complain about that were really small,&#34; he said. Now, not so much, and people have even asked where his inner peace comes from. &#34;I&#39;m, like, &#39;Honestly? I read David Goggins&#39; book.&#39;&#34;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

href=\"https://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/2021/03/14/heres-how-watch-mayor-blangiardis-first-state-city-address/\">first state-of-the-city speech</a> in mid-March, Rick Blangiardi, mayor of Honolulu, Hawaii, emphasized the city&#39;s commitment to &#34;climate resilience.&#34; </p><p>&#34;From sea level rise, rain bombs, and increasing temperatures, we&#39;re taking steps toward a climate-ready Oahu,&#34; said the mayor, who was sworn in at the start of 2021. The island of Oahu is home to the city and county of Honolulu. </p><p>&#34;We&#39;re shifting from talking about policy to doing something about it,&#34; Blangiardi added. </p><p>Sustainability and climate change are issues that Honolulu&#39;s leaders have been working to address for years. In 2016, the city was awarded a <a href=\"https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/news/100-resilient-cities-rockefeller-foundation-announce-37-new-member-cities-reaching-100-city-milestone-global-network/\">100 Resilient Cities Initiative Grant</a> from the Rockefeller Foundation to help fund the hiring of a chief resilience officer to work with the city on crafting climate change and resilience plans. </p><p>Since then, Honolulu has debuted a Resilience Strategy and a Climate Action Plan, which have helped inspire citywide legislation to reduce the energy burden on residents, promote access to renewable energy, expand clean transportation, and support locally grown food producers. </p><p>Here&#39;s a look at some of Honolulu&#39;s sustainability initiatives.</p>\n<div id=\"slideshow\">\n\tCodifying the Resilience Office's responsibilities will help Honolulu meet its sustainability goals\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/607059be30004b0019b26d7e?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Oʻahu Resilience Strategy Steering Committee members meeting during development phase of the strategy, which includes Honolulu Mayor Rick Blangiardi.\" height=\"1152\" width=\"1536\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Oahu Resilience Strategy Steering Committee members meeting during the development phase of the strategy, which includes Honolulu Mayor Rick Blangiardi.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Resilience Office</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>The <a href=\"https://resilientoahu.org/\">Office of Climate Change, Sustainability and Resiliency</a> was created by a city charter amendment that was approved by the public in 2016. A <a href=\"https://resilientoahu.org/bills\">new bill signed</a> into law in December 2020 \"codifies the duties, responsibilities, and reporting requirements\" of the office to ensure Honolulu meets its climate change and sustainability goals.&#160;</p><p>Bill 65 establishes an <a href=\"https://www.nrdc.org/experts/elizabeth-stampe/honolulu-climate-laws-will-reduce-driving-and-save-energy\">energy benchmarking system</a>, requiring Honolulu to create and report energy and water use benchmarks for city-owned buildings. The rule is estimated to save the city $7 million over the next decade. The bill also specifies that the city will transition to 100% renewable energy and become carbon neutral by 2045.&#160;&#160;</p><p>It also addresses many other climate change and sustainability measures, including a One Water policy, examining efficiencies across the city's water system.&#160;</p>\n\tThe Resilience Strategy addresses affordability and climate change\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60705a2730004b0019b26d83?format=jpeg\" alt=\"002.JPG\" height=\"1134\" width=\"1511\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The Resilience Office engaging community members on their perspectives of &#34;Resilience.&#34;\n<p class=\"copyright\">Resilience Office</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>One of the central initiatives of the Resilience Office is the <a href=\"https://online.flowpaper.com/74d206f1/OlaResilienceStrategy/#page=1\">Oahu Resilience Strategy</a>, which aims to address \"long-term affordability and the impacts of a climate crisis that is already driving islanders from their homes,\" according to the office's website.&#160;</p><p>Planning began in 2017 when the office met with Oahu's 33 neighborhood boards to survey residents about what concerned them most about climate change and how they thought it could be addressed, Matthew Gonser, chief resilience officer and executive director of Honolulu's Office of Climate Change, Sustainability and Resiliency, told Insider.&#160;</p><p>Hundreds of ideas were gathered from the community. Those concepts were narrowed down into 44 actions, comprising the Resilience Strategy. The strategy focuses on four broad subjects: long-term affordability, natural disaster preparedness and response, climate change, and local community leadership.&#160;</p><p>By the end of 2020, significant progress had been made on about half of the 44 resilience actions, Gonser said.</p>\n\tThe Climate Action Plan outlines what's needed to address climate change long term\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60705a9a30004b0019b26d89?format=jpeg\" alt=\"008\" height=\"3996\" width=\"5328\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The City and County of Honolulu Climate Action Plan open house community engagement session with Hawaii Pacific University and the Chamber of Commerce Hawaii.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Resilience Office</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>Honolulu's Resilience Office released the city's <a href=\"https://resilientoahu.org/climate-action-plan\">Climate Action Plan</a> in December 2020.</p><p>The plan was developed based on scientific evidence and community input to fight climate change and reduce fossil fuel emissions on Oahu. It spells out the needed programs, policies, and actions for the city to become carbon neutral by 2045 &#8212; and includes nine strategies to focus on over the next five years, including increasing renewable energy and energy efficiency.&#160;</p><p>To develop the Climate Action Plan, community meetings with Honolulu City Council members, Hawaii Pacific University, the University of Hawaii at Mānoa, and the Chamber of Commerce of Hawaii were held, and working groups with stakeholders were set up, Gonser said.&#160;</p><p>During the first few months of 2021, the public had the chance to share their opinions and concerns about the plan before it goes to the city council. Gonser said the Climate Action Plan will likely be adopted this year.&#160;</p>\n\tHonolulu updated parking ordinances to promote walkability and the use of clean energy transportation\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60705b324d3e410018b70357?format=jpeg\" alt=\"006\" height=\"2660\" width=\"3547\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Jeff Mikulina, executive director of Blue Planet, speaking at the signing of Ordinance 20-41, related to off-street parking and loading.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Resilience Office</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>At the end of 2020, former mayor Kirk Caldwell signed Bill 2 to <a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5e3885654a153a6ef84e6c9c/t/604fa68223340550a755dbff/1615832709176/Parking+and+Loading+Ord+20-41.pdf\">update Honolulu's mandatory parking requirements</a> for new developments. It gives developers more flexibility in how much parking to build and allows opportunities for the land to be used for other purposes, such as affordable housing.&#160;</p><p>\"It's making sure that our rules and regulations don't force overbuilding of parking, empowering more choice and leaving it to developers to determine what's needed,\" Gonser said.&#160;</p><p>The bill supports walkable neighborhoods and cleaner transportation options, such as biking and public transportation, which Honolulu plans to transition to clean fuel.&#160;</p><p>It could also make housing more affordable since constructing and maintaining parking is sometimes a hidden cost for renters, according to an <a href=\"https://ulupono.com/news-listing/report-reveals-the-hidden-costs-of-parking-in-hawaii/\">analysis by the Ulupono Initiative</a>, a Honolulu-based organization that provides grants, investments, and advocacy to support renewable energy, locally produced food, and other sustainability-minded projects.</p><p>For urban Honolulu renters, up to 37% of their rent may go toward parking, which, for decades, has often been built based on city regulation rather than actual need.&#160;&#160;&#160;</p><p>\"The bill makes progress in the right direction, better aligning with city climate and community goals, while allowing parking to remain accessible for those who genuinely need it and not requiring it of those who don't,\" Kathleen Rooney, Ulupono Initiative's director of transportation policy and programs, said <a href=\"https://ulupono.com/news-listing/bill-2-puts-honolulu-on-the-road-to-rightsizing-parking/\">when the bill was signed</a>.&#160;</p>\n\tMaking solar power more accessible eases Honolulu's energy burden\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60705baf4d3e410018b7035b?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Solar array installation on top of the Board of Water Supply, City and County of Honolulu\" height=\"981\" width=\"1310\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Solar array installation on top of the Board of Water Supply.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Resilience Office</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>Hawaii has one of the highest average electricity retail prices in the country, according to the <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/state/?sid=HI#tabs-5\">US Energy Information Administration</a>, and the state relies on petroleum for most of its electricity generation.&#160;</p><p>Reducing the energy burden is a key focus area of Honolulu's Resilience Office.

The goal is to cut down on the costs and time it takes to install solar systems.&#160;</p><p>Creating more equitable access to renewable energy is an important component in making Honolulu an affordable place to live, Gonser said.&#160;</p><p>\"We have one of the highest energy burdens in the nation,\" he said. \"It's updating our energy code and making sure that all new things that are being built are ensuring long-term affordability for residents and that they can benefit from progressive infrastructure so that we can reduce the energy burden over time.\"</p>\n\tNew performance-based regulations could lower energy bills for residents\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60705c474d3e410018b70362?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Infographic HPUC Timeline with PBR\" height=\"3300\" width=\"5100\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>A timeline of the Hawaiian Public Utilities Commission.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Ulupono Initiative</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>As another initiative aimed at reducing energy bills, Hawaii's Public Utilities Commission <a href=\"https://puc.hawaii.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/PBR-Phase-2-DO.Page-Press-Release.Final_.12-22-2020.pdf\">approved a new Performance-Based Regulation Framework</a> in late 2020. The framework would transform utility company Hawaiian Electric by making its operations more efficient, lowering electricity rates, improving services, and meeting the state's clean energy goals.&#160;</p><p>\"That's really groundbreaking,\" Amy Hennessy, senior vice president of communications and external affairs at Ulupono Initiative, which <a href=\"https://ulupono.com/news-listing/white-paper-performance-based-regulation/\">provided research</a> and other information to guide the framework's adoption, told Insider. \"The impacts toward changing the incentives for our utility to transform into a renewable energy future are significant.\"&#160;</p><p>The new structure provides <a href=\"https://www.staradvertiser.com/2020/12/28/hawaii-news/hawaiian-electric-bills-to-drop-under-new-puc-rules/?HSA=a11bdd3aa7748a6352ba20b771c9a0cc17f0017c\">financial incentives</a> for the electric company to meet certain goals, like creating savings for lower-income customers and reducing greenhouse gases.

David Ige announced in October 2020 that the state would provide a <a href=\"https://governor.hawaii.gov/newsroom/latest-news/office-of-the-governor-news-release-government-private-sector-partnership-double-food-bucks-to-help-hawaii-families-and-local-agriculture/\">$500,000 matching donation</a> to the <a href=\"https://dabux.org/\">DA BUX Double Up Food Bucks program</a>, which doubles the amount of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, formerly known as food stamps, that are spent on locally grown food.&#160;</p><p>Several private-sector organizations raised $500,000 for the program, including the <a href=\"https://stupski.org/\">Stupski Foundation</a> and Ulupono Initiative, which each provided $200,000. The state match offers $1 million total for the program.&#160;</p><p>Addressing hunger and providing incentives to encourage residents to buy more locally grown and produced food are part of Honolulu's Resilience Strategy. The DA BUX Double Up Food Bucks program also aims to strengthen the local economy because it keeps residents' food budgets on the island.</p><p>\"A million dollars going out into communities for not just those who need access to food, but also our local farmers who needed a market &#8212; it's actually putting dollars in their pockets while they're growing to help provide healthy options for the community,\" Hennessy said. \"So it's really a triple win.\"</p>\n</div><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

Check with each winery for the latest details as you plan your visit. Many wineries are operating with reduced capacity, limited indoor seating, mask requirements (when not tasting wine), and enhanced cleaning measures. Some wineries are also requiring reservations and restricting the number of guests who can visit, so consult their websites and make reservations in advance if you can.&#160;</p><p>State and local COVID-19 restrictions will also impact how each winery is able to operate. <a href=\"https://www.napavalley.com/blog/visiting-napa-valley-during-covid-19/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Napa Valley</a>, for example, is advising visitors to wear masks and practice social distancing. In general, expect limited interaction between customers and servers at tasting rooms, contactless ordering and payment, and even temperature checks before entering some wineries.&#160;</p><h2>What's the best time to visit a winery?</h2><p>Keep in mind that vineyards are working farms, so they'll be busy places during peak grape harvest season (roughly July to October, depending on the region). A winery (where wine is produced) may be separate from the actual vineyard, and a tasting room might also be separate from the growing operation.</p><p>Many are open year-round, but check with the winery for specifics on their schedule, including any vineyard tours and wine-tasting programs they may offer. If you're hoping to have a chance to chat with a winemaker, you might want to choose a quieter time of year.&#160;</p><p>Keep in mind that finding available accommodation in high-demand areas during the peak summer and fall seasons can be a challenge, so book early to avoid disappointment.</p><h2>What are the best wine regions in the US?</h2><p>There are currently <a href=\"https://www.ttb.gov/wine/established-avas\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">252 established AVAs</a> across the country, reflecting a wide range of growing conditions and geographic features in states you might expect (California, Washington, Oregon, New York), and those which might surprise you (Texas, Arizona, New Jersey, Wisconsin). In fact, the oldest AVA is actually in Missouri (the Augusta AVA, established in 1980, just a few months before Napa Valley).

Ron DeSantis<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/desantis-florida-vaccine-passport-ban2021-4\"> issued an executive order</a> banning vaccine passports and <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/kayak-first-hotel-in-miami-beach-florida-tech-life-house-2021-3\">local businesses</a> from requiring this proof of vaccination. This ban applies to cruise lines as well, DeSantis&#39; press secretary Cody McCloud told Insider in an email.</p><p>&#34;The Governor&#39;s Executive Order provides that <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/travelers-are-flocking-to-miami-for-spring-break-despite-covid-2021-3\">businesses in Florida </a>are prohibited from requiring patrons or customers to provide any documentation certifying COVID-19 vaccination or post-transmission recovery to gain access to, entry upon, or service from the business,&#34; McCloud told Insider in an email. &#34;Therefore, the Executive Order prohibits cruise lines from requiring vaccine passports for their Florida operations.&#34;</p><p><em><strong>Read more: </strong><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-south-florida-became-the-conservative-shadow-capital-2021-4\">The Great GOP Migration: How South Florida became a shadow capital for Trump conservatives</a></em></p><p>However, many cruise lines have already <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/cruise-ship-covid-vaccine-requirements-guests-crew-each-company-2021-2\">announced some form of a vaccine requirement</a>, whether it be for crew, guests, or both. This includes Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, which <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/norwegian-cruise-line-requiring-covid-vaccine-for-guests-crew-on-new-cruises-2021-4\">recently unveiled a sweeping vaccine requirement</a> for its Norwegian, Oceania, and Regent Seven Seas brand. Other cruise lines, such as Royal Caribbean, have held off on guest or crew requirements, instead opting to announce<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/social-media-facebok-twitter-for-royal-caribbean-cruise-boycott-2021-3\"> select &#34;fully vaccinated&#34; sailings</a>.</p><p>However, major cruise lines - with the exception of those with a sweeping vaccine mandate - have withheld announcing a vaccine policy for future sailing series departing from US ports. So far, all of Royal Caribbean&#39;s cruises operating under a vaccine order will be sailing out of international ports located in countries like Israel, Bermuda, and Cyprus. </p><p>DeSantis&#39; decision to prohibit cruise lines from requiring vaccines could prove to be yet another major issue for cruise companies, many of which have historically sailed out of Florida ports. But some experts have questioned DeSantis&#39; <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/miami-beach-extended-state-of-emergency-spring-break-travelers-2021-3\">ability to impose such a ban upon cruise lines</a>, according to a <a href=\"https://www.sun-sentinel.com/business/fl-bz-silversea-cruises-to-require-vaccinations-20210412-7ok6fwabpndc5aop6oyla5tgvq-story.html\">report from the Sun Sentinel</a>.</p><p>This includes Jim Walker - an attorney based in South Florida with a specialization in maritime law - who told the <a href=\"https://www.sun-sentinel.com/business/fl-bz-silversea-cruises-to-require-vaccinations-20210412-7ok6fwabpndc5aop6oyla5tgvq-story.html\">Sun Sentinel</a> that DeSantis may not have the jurisdiction needed to either prohibit cruise lines from enforcing a vaccine mandate or<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/florida-sue-cdc-cruise-industry-pause-2021-4\"> bring cruises back</a>. </p><p>Regardless, it could be a while before we see any stand-off between the state and cruise lines interested in sailing out of Florida with a vaccine requirement.</p><p>The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has yet to give cruise lines the green light to resume sailing and has <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/cruises-safest-place-on-earth-covid-vaccine-norwegian-cruise-ceo-2021-4\">shied away from enforcing an industry-wide vaccine mandate</a>. As a result, no major cruise lines will be sailing from US ports in the near future, even if the ship is traveling with a vaccine mandate.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/cruise-lines-florida-conflict-covid-vaccine-requirements-2021-4'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=Vuz51ns70Hk:M0AtLsUKDpk:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=Vuz51ns70Hk:M0AtLsUKDpk:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=Vuz51ns70Hk:M0AtLsUKDpk:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=Vuz51ns70Hk:M0AtLsUKDpk:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=Vuz51ns70Hk:M0AtLsUKDpk:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=Vuz51ns70Hk:M0AtLsUKDpk:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=Vuz51ns70Hk:M0AtLsUKDpk:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=Vuz51ns70Hk:M0AtLsUKDpk:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/Vuz51ns70Hk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 14 Apr 2021 15:48:08 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/6075c33b3e3fe7001882a622?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"06a1a4128fb4ea1eb53dc6da2c73df00","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn64@2020_1/2021/04/14/18-15-27-696_00cf84c73d0e272a.webp","destWidth":3568,"destHeight":2676,"sourceBytes":343940,"destBytes":343940,"author":"bchang@businessinsider.com (Brittany Chang)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/6075c2c33e3fe7001882a61c?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn41@2020_2/2021/04/14/18-15-30-541_034b1833a863e811.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn1@2020_2/2021/04/14/18-15-35-145_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=Vuz51ns70Hk:M0AtLsUKDpk:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn13@2020_5/2021/04/14/18-15-29-928_2d07533a19a0fa23.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=Vuz51ns70Hk:M0AtLsUKDpk:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn5@2020_6/2021/04/14/18-15-32-924_47f9e5f80daaffc8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn29@2020_4/2021/04/14/18-15-29-996_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=Vuz51ns70Hk:M0AtLsUKDpk:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn39@2020_1/2021/04/14/18-15-28-579_cee6f4b7e91c6cbc.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/Vuz51ns70Hk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn49@2020_4/2021/04/14/18-15-29-594_f21a4923e80fe100.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618424108850},{"createdTime":"2021-04-15 02:15:08","updatedTime":"2021-04-15 02:15:08","title":"The 5 best TV antennas in 2021 for watching free local channels","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-hdtv-indoor-antenna","description":"<bi-shortcode id=\"table-of-contents-sticky\" class=\"mceNonEditable\" data-type=\"h2\">Table of Contents: Masthead Sticky</bi-shortcode><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>An indoor antenna allows you to watch free local channels on your TV without a cable plan.</li>\n<li id=\"recirc\">Modern antennas can be attached to your wall or placed on a stand for easy installation.</li>\n<li>Our top choice is the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0754WJ3FX/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=biip_020316_hdtv-antenna-buying-guide-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B0754WJ3FX&linkId=1cf6e73d174f1496a69487a468557d00174f1496a69487a468557d00\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Channel Master FLATenna+</a> thanks to its simple setup and strong reception.</li>\n</ul><p>An indoor antenna is a cheap and simple way to get local TV channels without a cable or streaming subscription</p><p>Most antennas today are as thin as a sheet of paper and can get dozens of channels as far as 60 miles away.

After testing several different models, we&#39;ve picked the best antennas you can buy, all for under $100.</p><h2>Here are the best indoor antennas of 2021:</h2><ul class=\"summary-list\"><li><strong>Best indoor antenna overall: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0754WJ3FX/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=biip_020316_hdtv-antenna-buying-guide-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B0754WJ3FX&linkId=1cf6e73d174f1496a69487a468557d00174f1496a69487a468557d00\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Channel Master FLATenna+</a></strong></li><li><strong>Best budget indoor antenna: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B074TWSQFM/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=biip_020316_hdtv-antenna-buying-guide-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B074TWSQFM&linkId=54cf1593abf5798a85bb0212ab0dd71aabf5798a85bb0212ab0dd71a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Channel Master FLATenna Duo 35</a></strong></li><li><strong>Best indoor/outdoor combo antenna: <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/1736470766984890722\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Antennas Direct ClearStream 2Max</a></strong></li><li><strong>Best compact indoor antenna: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01HZD5MUM/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=biip_020316_hdtv-antenna-buying-guide-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B01HZD5MUM&linkId=6a37a6d9f9d7086e4495bcb220ac1691f9d7086e4495bcb220ac1691\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Antennas Direct ClearStream Eclipse Amplified</a></strong></li><li><strong>Best indoor antenna for easy setup: <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/1736471325802795306\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Mohu Leaf Fifty</a></strong></li></ul><aside class=\"quick-tip headline-regular\"><p><strong>Updated on 4/14/2021 by Ben Blanchet: </strong>This is a complete guide revision with entirely new testing and antenna picks for each category. </p></aside>\n<div id=\"slideshow\">\n\tThe best indoor antenna overall\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/6064bb94daf0f10018f9947f?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Channel Master’s FLATenna&#43; antenna\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Ben Blanchet/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<h3>The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0754WJ3FX/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biip_020316_hdtv-antenna-buying-guide-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B0754WJ3FX&#38;linkId=1cf6e73d174f1496a69487a468557d00\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Channel Master FLATenna+</a> is a lightweight antenna with a wide range, reliable reception, and an affordable price.</h3><aside class=\"breakout-box headline-regular\"><ul><li><strong>Design</strong>: Flat for wall or window</li><li><strong>Range</strong>: Up to 50 miles</li><li><strong>Amplifier</strong>: MicroAmp to improve signal</li><li><strong>Channels received</strong>: 70 during our testing</li></ul></aside><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Amplifier addresses choppy picture, subtle design, includes 3M tape for attaching to your wall, coaxial cable included</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>Takes longer to install due to amplifier</p><p>Out of all the antennas we tested, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0754WJ3FX/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biip_020316_hdtv-antenna-buying-guide-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B0754WJ3FX&#38;linkId=1cf6e73d174f1496a69487a468557d00\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Channel Master FLATenna+</a> offers the best bang for your buck. For $40, you get a reliable indoor antenna that's relatively easy to install and offers a range of around 50 miles.&#160;</p><p>The model is paper thin and you can stick it to any part of your wall or window after applying the included 3M tape to the back. After I hung up the antenna it firmly held itself to the wall for over four weeks while testing.</p><p>The downside is that it takes slightly longer to install, but that's due to Channel Master's MicroAmp that you can screw in to improve reception. Channel Master claims its MicroAmp helps receive difficult-to-reach channels and, while that may be true, it makes this model a little less plug-and-play friendly.&#160;</p><p>In my area, the antenna picked up eight 1080i channels, including CBS, NBC, ABC, Fox, government channels, and Telemundo. It also picked up 62 other local stations while eliminating a number of channels that appeared choppy on Channel Master's FLATenna 35 model.&#160;</p><p>In fact, none of the channels I watched with this antenna were choppy. It's a breeze to flip through stations and, over time, none of the channels disappeared from my lineup. When stacked up to other antennas we tested, this model also had shorter delays when picking up a station.</p><p>If you're looking for an affordable indoor antenna with a simple design and reliable reception, this one is your best bet overall.</p><aside class=\"quick-tip headline-regular\"><p><strong>Note:</strong> This item is expected to be back in stock on April 16.</p></aside>\n\tThe best budget indoor antenna\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/6064cabb6183e1001981994e?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Channel Master’s FLATenna&#43; antenna\" height=\"814\" width=\"1085\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Ben Blanchet/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<h3><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B074TWSQFM/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biip_020316_hdtv-antenna-buying-guide-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B074TWSQFM&#38;linkId=54cf1593abf5798a85bb0212ab0dd71a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Channel Master's FLATenna 35 Duo</a> is one of the most affordable antennas on the market, and it delivers solid reception for local channels.</h3><aside class=\"breakout-box headline-regular\"><ul><li><strong>Design</strong>: Flat for wall or window</li><li><strong>Range</strong>: Up to 35 miles</li><li><strong>Amplifier</strong>: Not included&#160;</li><li><strong>Channels received: </strong>79 during our testing</li></ul></aside><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Inexpensive, simple setup</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>Channels get choppy at times, coaxial cable isn't included when you buy from major retailers, no amp</p><p>If you're looking for a more affordable version of our top pick, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B074TWSQFM/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biip_020316_hdtv-antenna-buying-guide-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B074TWSQFM&#38;linkId=54cf1593abf5798a85bb0212ab0dd71a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Channel Master FLATenna 35</a> costs less and is nearly identical. The main difference here is that this model does not include the MicroAmp or coaxial cable. We found that the MicroAmp helped provide better reception, but if you're on a budget, the base model is still a good buy.&#160;</p><p>Just like the FLATenna+, this model is paper thin and you just need the 3M tape included in the package to install it on a wall or window.&#160;Channel Master is currently including a 12-foot coaxial cable for free if you buy the antenna through its site, but this model doesn't usually come with a cable.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B074TWSQFM/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biip_020316_hdtv-antenna-buying-guide-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B074TWSQFM&#38;linkId=54cf1593abf5798a85bb0212ab0dd71a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">FLATenna 35</a> received my local ABC, NBC, CBS, and Fox channels. It also found a lot of Spanish language channels including Univision, Azteca, Estrela, and more. Other local stations, like Crime and GetTV, came through without any issues. I received 22 channels with a picture quality of 720p or higher.</p><p>Compared to other antennas I tested, the only major channel the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B074TWSQFM/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biip_020316_hdtv-antenna-buying-guide-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B074TWSQFM&#38;linkId=54cf1593abf5798a85bb0212ab0dd71a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">FLATenna</a> couldn't pick up was PBS Kids. But while I received 79 channels, a handful of those stations came through with choppy images, which isn't ideal. Since it doesn't include the MicroAmp, this model is rated for a shorter range of 35 miles, which might account for the choppiness.&#160;</p>\n\tThe best indoor/outdoor combo antenna\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/6064cad56183e1001981994f?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Antennas Direct’s ClearStream 2Max antenna\" height=\"788\" width=\"1051\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Ben Blanchet/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<h3>The <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/1736470766984890722\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Antennas Direct ClearStream 2Max</a> features a solid, stable design that can be used indoors and outdoors.</h3><aside class=\"breakout-box headline-regular\"><ul><li><strong>Design:</strong> Table top or wall mount, outdoor-ready</li><li><strong>Range:</strong> Up to 60 miles</li><li><strong>Amplifier: </strong>Not included</li><li><strong>Channels received:</strong> 65 during our testing</li></ul></aside><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Unique design, sturdy feel, solid channel reception, designed for indoor and outdoor use</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>Pricey, difficult setup, no coaxial cord included</p><p>The <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/1736470766984890722\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Antennas Direct ClearStream 2Max</a> stands out from other models with its interesting design as, once you lift it up, the antenna looks like a bird flying in the sky.&#160;</p><p>The setup takes roughly 10 minutes and, while it was difficult to put the mount on at the bottom, it remained sturdy throughout my use. There wasn't any choppy picture on any of the channels I tested, and it managed to receive all the major local offerings, such as ABC, NBC, CBS, and Fox.&#160;</p><p>While this model firmly stands on its own after setup, it's important to note that it doesn't come with a coaxial cable. This isn't a huge hassle, however, as coaxial cables are sold at many stores. But, the omission is still disappointing given the antenna's already high cost.</p><p>Although it's pricier than our other picks, this model has the added flexibility to be used outside instead of indoors if you want a better signal. The model's mounting base allows you to clamp the antenna onto your roof or home to capture signals outdoors.&#160;</p>\n\tThe best compact indoor antenna\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/6064bd87daf0f10018f9948e?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Antennas Direct’s ClearStream Eclipse Amplified antenna\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Ben Blanchet/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<h3>The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01HZD5MUM/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biip_020316_hdtv-antenna-buying-guide-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B01HZD5MUM&#38;linkId=6a37a6d9f9d7086e4495bcb220ac1691\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Antennas Direct ClearStream Eclipse</a> is a thin amplified antenna that takes up little space.</h3><aside class=\"breakout-box headline-regular\"><ul><li><strong>Design:</strong> Flat for wall or window</li><li><strong>Range: </strong>Up to 50 miles</li><li><strong>Amplifier:</strong> 15db Jolt in-line amplifier</li><li><strong>Channels received: </strong>56 during our testing</li></ul></aside><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Quick access to channels, thin and compact, coaxial cable included</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>PBS channels difficult to find in my area</p><p>Although the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01HZD5MUM/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biip_020316_hdtv-antenna-buying-guide-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B01HZD5MUM&#38;linkId=6a37a6d9f9d7086e4495bcb220ac1691\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Antennas Direct ClearStream Eclipse Amplified</a> picked up about nine channels less than the 2Max model in my area, it's actually much quicker to set up.

You can take it down and put the model somewhere else, as well, and it will still hold up at a different location. It picks up a solid amount of channels thanks to its in-line amplifier, too. The small, external amplifier is simple to install, and the antenna itself is the most compact of all the units I tried.&#160;&#160;</p><p>Some of the channels I received include local CBS, Fox, NBC, and ABC. One downside is it doesn't pick up my local PBS channels or government channels, such as NYGov and NYLife, like some of the other models do.</p><p>This antenna also received the least amount of 1080i channels, six compared to the roughly 10 channels I received from other antennas.

This enabled the easiest installation of any antenna I tested. The push pins are about the size of a single hair, and prevent the antenna from popping out on my wall like it would with tape behind it.</p><p>After I scanned for available channels, I picked up 74 stations including 10 channels with 1080i video and 11 channels in 720p. All of the major local channels were easily picked up, including Fox, CBS, NBC, and ABC. None of the channels were choppy and each loaded on my TV in a matter of seconds.</p><p>It should be noted, however, that just before I installed the antenna, there was a strong smell coming from the product. The odor went away after a few minutes but if you're sensitive to certain plastic scents, you may want to leave the box open a bit before installing right away.</p>\n\tHow we test antennas\n\t\n\t<p>All the antennas we test are either indoor-only antennas or models that are designed for both indoor and outdoor use. We tested each antenna at the same location under the same conditions at a third-floor apartment in the Astoria neighborhood of Queens, New York.&#160;</p><p>The same smart TV is used with each antenna. The units are set up about two feet from a window with no visible obstacles, like trees or wires outside of the building, that could impact the signal. All antennas are placed in the same location above or near the TV. We judge each antenna's channel support by comparing it to a list of channels that the <a href=\"http://www.antennaweb.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AntennaWeb tool</a> predict will be available at our address.&#160;</p><p>We also account for cost and design when evaluating each model. We determine picture quality based on whether we notice any signal losses or choppiness during our testing period.</p><p>To test each antenna, we watch variety of channels for about 45 minutes. As far as the installation process goes, we use an iPhone timer to record the time it takes to unbox each antenna until it's set up near the TV.&#160;</p><p>One important takeaway from our testing is that the manufacturer's listed range does not necessarily translate to better performance compared to antennas with lower listed ranges. For instance, an antenna we tested with a listed range of 60 miles actually picks up fewer channels in our area than an antenna listed with a 35-mile range.&#160;</p><p>On that note, it's important to keep in mind that overall antenna performance will vary depending on your specific location.</p>\n\tWhat else we considered\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/6064bfa86183e1001981990e?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Amazon Basics Amplified Indoor Outdoor TV antenna\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Ben Blanchet/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>During our testing, we also considered a few other antennas. Here are the other antennas we evaluated for this guide, and why they didn't end up making the cut.&#160;&#160;</p><h3>Antennas we don't recommend:</h3><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07C3Y8SDH/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biip_020316_hdtv-antenna-buying-guide-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B07C3Y8SDH&#38;linkId=8fa9ad196044b5dab1150e286b8a7a37\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Amazon Basics' Amplified Indoor/Outdoor TV antenna</a></strong>: While this model is around the median price of other units we looked at, it was the most complicated to set up. It took me roughly 20 minutes to install since the unit was missing a pair of screws in the package. Amazon did send me a replacement, however, which included the screws. This was also the largest model we tested, which makes it less convenient. And, while it got 70 channels on my first try, most of the 480p channels were choppy and broadcasts dropped in and out.&#160;</p><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GGAIIQ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biip_020316_hdtv-antenna-buying-guide-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B001GGAIIQ&#38;linkId=1ba67330b5ad8ca82d35bea1d6096f59\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">RCA Multi-Directional Antenna</a></strong>: This antenna received the least amount channels &#8211; 42 &#8211; out of all the models I tried.

The package comes with a salt shaker-size antenna and is one of the cheaper options I've come across. While the rabbit ear design could bring back memories, nine of its 68 channels &#8212; such as HSN, PBS, and Fox &#8212; appeared choppy on my TV. This is a decent option if you're looking for a bargain, but you can get better consistency with a slightly pricier model.</p>\n\tWhat we look forward to testing\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/6064ce4cdaf0f10018f994e9?format=jpeg\" alt=\"antop antenna\" height=\"750\" width=\"1000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Amazon</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>Other antennas we hope to try out in coming months include <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07XZ6RG34/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biip_020316_hdtv-antenna-buying-guide-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B07XZ6RG34&#38;linkId=8a9f0ba3fc4b97d3c0f5c9f3be541074\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Antop's HD Smart Antenna SBS-301</a>.

That model takes us back to our childhood with the classic, retro TV antenna design and also features a small size for easy placement.</p>\n\tAntenna FAQs\n\t\n\t<h3>What do I need before I purchase an antenna?</h3><p>Before you purchase an antenna, you'll want to make sure your TV includes an integrated digital tuner. This is standard for <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-tv-under-500-dollars\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">virtually any TV you can currently buy</a>, but if you still own a very old set you might need to purchase a separate digital tuner.</p><p>You'll also want to check whether or not the antenna you're considering comes with a coaxial cord. The cord is the only way you can connect your antenna to your TV so you'll need to buy a separate one if it's not included. If you want to place your antenna in the window or in a space away from your TV, you should measure the distance beforehand to see if the cord is long enough.</p><hr /><h3>What channels can I get with an antenna?</h3><p>Antennas pick up over-the-air broadcast channels that are available in your area. This typically means local networks like NBC, ABC, CBS, and Fox, along with a few dozen other stations. Channel availability, however, can drastically differ depending on whether your community is more rural or urban.&#160;</p><p>One way to check available channels in your community is through the <a href=\"http://www.antennaweb.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AntennaWeb tool</a>. Just enter your address in the search bar and a list of channels that can be picked up in your area will show up in the results.</p><hr /><h3>Are there any limitations with an antenna?</h3><p>Antennas, unlike cable or streaming services, will only pick up local channels. If you want to see content from the likes of ESPN, AMC, FX, Disney Channel, and more, an antenna probably isn't for you. We recommend getting <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-much-is-sling-tv\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sling TV</a> ($35/month) for streaming access to more networks, as it's cheaper than most cable services.</p><p>Antenna reception can also be limited by external factors in your area. This means things like the amount of trees outside your home or nearby buildings could impact your viewing. The location of broadcast towers in your area, weather, and your room's shape and design can also impact your reception. In other words, the performance you get from an antenna can be rather finicky compared to cable and streaming.&#160;</p><p>Unlike most cable boxes, an antenna on its own won't let you record and store shows, though some external DVRs can be bought separately to record TV broadcasts from an antenna. Depending on your TV, you also might not get any kind of on-screen guide for navigation. This means, you have to manually go through each channel. With that said, some smart TVs now include guide integration for antenna playback.</p><hr /><h3>What video and audio quality can I get with an antenna?</h3><p>Most over-the-air broadcasts currently offer high definition (HD) picture quality with either 720p or 1080i resolution. This matches the resolution that most cable and live TV streaming services provide.&#160;</p><p>With that said, antenna-based broadcasts can actually look better than cable. Cable tends to compress video and audio quality more than antennas, so over-the-air TV will typically provide the clearest quality you can find in a broadcast. That is, as long as your reception is strong.</p><p>Over the next few years, some over-the-air stations will begin to broadcast in 4K through the new ATSC 3.0 standard, aka NextGenTV. NextGenTV's 4K broadcasts are already available in markets like Pittsburgh and Phoenix, and will make their way to cities like Buffalo and Orlando throughout 2021.&#160;</p><p>If you want to keep your current antenna, you can, but you'll have to buy an ATSC 3.0 tuner or a 4K TV with a built-in ATSC 3.0 tuner to actually watch in 4K. You can find more information on <a href=\"https://www.atsc.org/nextgen-tv/deployments/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">when 4K broadcasts will become available here</a>.</p><hr /><h3>Can I get local channels without an antenna?</h3><p>Yes. If you don't want to purchase an antenna or you don't already get local stations through cable, there are several streaming options that provide local channels over an internet connection.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.locast.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Locast</a> streaming app offers local channels for free, but the service periodically interrupts streaming with donation requests unless you pay $5 a month to support the non-profit app. We don't recommend this as the best option, as it's cheaper to pay for an antenna in the long run, since the investment will pay off after a couple of months' use.</p><p>Other ways to stream local channels without an antenna include live TV streaming services like <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sling.com%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Sling TV</a>, <a href=\"https://www.fubo.tv/welcome?irad=343747&#38;irmp=196318\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Fubo TV</a>, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-watch-live-tv-on-hulu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hulu + Live TV</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-set-up-youtube-tv\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YouTube TV</a>. Each service offers a different assortment of channels, including many cable networks you can't get with an antenna, so you'll want to ensure that the stations you want are available.</p>\n</div><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/best-hdtv-indoor-antenna'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=JB_y_JxMHRQ:y7FMUtNm614:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=JB_y_JxMHRQ:y7FMUtNm614:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=JB_y_JxMHRQ:y7FMUtNm614:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=JB_y_JxMHRQ:y7FMUtNm614:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=JB_y_JxMHRQ:y7FMUtNm614:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=JB_y_JxMHRQ:y7FMUtNm614:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=JB_y_JxMHRQ:y7FMUtNm614:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=JB_y_JxMHRQ:y7FMUtNm614:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/JB_y_JxMHRQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 14 Apr 2021 15:04:10 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/6064bee56183e10019819909?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"84e93521c2be046c32e561f4a2d33830","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn63@2020_6/2021/04/14/18-15-21-367_b8cbbe380dfe2df4.webp","destWidth":1200,"destHeight":900,"sourceBytes":16586,"destBytes":16586,"author":"insider@insider.com (Ben Blanchet)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/6064bb94daf0f10018f9947f?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn70@2020_4/2021/04/14/18-15-35-947_bf267c40f6db00d6.webp","https://i.insider.com/6064cabb6183e1001981994e?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn21@2020_6/2021/04/14/18-15-31-752_5f24b3a90e9881cd.webp","https://i.insider.com/6064cad56183e1001981994f?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn90@2020_3/2021/04/14/18-15-29-399_8016319e8e13a382.webp","https://i.insider.com/6064bd87daf0f10018f9948e?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn89@2020_4/2021/04/14/18-15-33-997_e0a93e90f5e75b7c.webp","https://i.insider.com/6064bee56183e10019819909?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn63@2020_6/2021/04/14/18-15-21-367_b8cbbe380dfe2df4.webp","https://i.insider.com/6064bfa86183e1001981990e?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn2@2020_2/2021/04/14/18-15-36-354_49d3263102f371f5.webp","https://i.insider.com/6064ce4cdaf0f10018f994e9?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn42@2020_4/2021/04/14/18-15-31-919_88f8cf2894f92d4b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn1@2020_2/2021/04/14/18-15-35-145_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=JB_y_JxMHRQ:y7FMUtNm614:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn73@2020_3/2021/04/14/18-15-29-008_25be0c83651ac050.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=JB_y_JxMHRQ:y7FMUtNm614:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn58@2020_1/2021/04/14/18-15-33-737_9e99a1ab4f93eff0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn29@2020_4/2021/04/14/18-15-29-996_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=JB_y_JxMHRQ:y7FMUtNm614:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn52@2020_2/2021/04/14/18-15-28-482_fb320bc0d6b3c666.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/JB_y_JxMHRQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn83@2020_5/2021/04/14/18-15-28-254_f327953e9ea486d5.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618424108856},{"createdTime":"2021-04-15 02:15:08","updatedTime":"2021-04-15 02:15:08","title":"Poland is buying 5 cargo planes out of the US Air Force's 'boneyard'","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/poland-buying-cargo-planes-out-of-us-air-force-boneyard-2021-4","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/6076fb704206150018175676?format=jpeg\" alt=\"US Air Force C-130H\" height=\"700\" width=\"1400\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Airmen from the Wyoming Air National Guard prepare a C-130H for a mission out of Cheyenne, Wyoming, February 27, 2019.\n<p class=\"copyright\">US Air Force/Master Sgt.

The aircraft would be partially retrofitted with new equipment, made flightworthy, and then they would fly to Poland.</p><p>The agreement has a relatively low value - USD $14.3 million. The US side, the Polish MoD reports, assumes that five C-130H airframes that the <a href=\"https://theaviationist.com/2020/05/08/despite-the-covid-19-crisis-polish-air-force-f-16s-continue-intensive-flight-training-activities/\">Polish Air Force</a> would receive. They are worth $60 million, as per the US quote. The deliveries would be finalized by mid-2024, with the first aircraft arriving this year.</p><p>According to the Polish MoD, the aircraft procured rolled off the production line in 1985 and then were decommissioned in 2017. After that, they were stored at the <a href=\"https://theaviationist.com/2019/08/05/photo-captures-the-moment-as-lightning-strikes-a-c-5-galaxys-tail-at-the-amarg-boneyard-in-davis-monthan-afb/\">309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group facility (AMARG)</a> in Tucson, Arizona. The above makes them 15 years younger than the C-130s currently operated by the Polish Air Force.</p><p>The technical status of the aircraft was assessed during the so-called Joint Visual Inspection procedure. It took place at AMARG in Tucson, stated the Inspectorate. The cost of the transfer to Poland was also a subject of this process.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5995baabb0e0b51c008b5b28?format=jpeg\" alt=\"C-130 Hercules takeoff landing gear\" height=\"2120\" width=\"3185\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>An Illinois Air National Guard C-130 Hercules takes off at Fort Carson in Colorado, September 12, 2016.\n<p class=\"copyright\">US Air Force photo/Master Sgt. Joseph Swafford</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Then, after the transfer, the aircraft would undergo the periodic, scheduled maintenance (Programmed Depot Maintenance - PDM) at the WZL Nr 2 S.A. facility in Bydgoszcz, Poland. Bydgoszcz is also going to be the place where extra equipment, as required by the Polish Air Force, would be fitted onto the aircraft. Then the airframes are expected to become a part of the inventory of the 33rd Airlift Base in Powidz.</p><p>It has been pointed out by the experts that both the engines, as well as the propellers, along with the avionics, may need to be upgraded. What upgrades would be done within that scope remains unclear. However, to make the acquisition reasonable, the AMARG restoration work should also include an upgrade similar to the ones carried out in case of the ANG aircraft: a set of new T-56 Rolls Royce 3.5 engines and NP2000 eight-bladed propellers with electronic controls.</p><p>The PGZ Group&#39;s WZL facility in Bydgoszcz provides the Polish Air Force with a relevant maintenance capability regarding the Hercules.</p><p>The Polish MoD was putting the airlift capability enhancements in the modernization plans - the procurement was designated as the Drop program. It involved Leonardo S.p.A., Airbus Defence &#38; Space, Embraer, Lockheed Martin, and Boeing, but it was ultimately suspended in July last year. It seems that Poland went with second-hand airframes to serve as an intermediary gap-filler solution.</p><p>Krzysztof Płatek, spokesman for the Armament Inspectorate told us that the Drop program is to follow a schedule that is confidential. Procurement of the AMARG C-130s would diminish the pressure caused by deadlines and time.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet blockquote\" data-lang=\"en\" data-cards=\"\"

And they have a subscription product coming up, a whole range of services, the custody services, they have a number of other levers to pull as they go up,&#34; Rao said.</p><p><em><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/bitcoin-contango-offers-risk-free-high-return-trade-opportunity-futures-2021-4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bitcoin is a headache to store, and that&#39;s created an investment opportunity that could theoretically pay determined traders big risk-free returns by December</a></em></p><p>The head of research added that, in his view, there&#39;s no reason why crypto prices should stop going up as investors are starting to realize the space will become &#34;an integral part of the financial system going forward.&#34;</p><p>Rao also noted that of the best features of Coinbase is that it&#39;s &#34;agnostic&#34; towards individual cryptocurrencies, meaning if bitcoin falls and other cryptocurrencies rise, Coinbase will still benefit.</p><p>The head of research at Manhattan Venture Partners ended the interview by saying that Coinbase has the breadth, scale, and technology to keep competitors at bay over the long haul.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/coinbase-100-billion-valuation-reasonable-disruptive-firm-manhattan-venture-partners-2021-4'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=mYy_VSCGd_Y:7wUAXVGBbes:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=mYy_VSCGd_Y:7wUAXVGBbes:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=mYy_VSCGd_Y:7wUAXVGBbes:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=mYy_VSCGd_Y:7wUAXVGBbes:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=mYy_VSCGd_Y:7wUAXVGBbes:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=mYy_VSCGd_Y:7wUAXVGBbes:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=mYy_VSCGd_Y:7wUAXVGBbes:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=mYy_VSCGd_Y:7wUAXVGBbes:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/mYy_VSCGd_Y\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 14 Apr 2021 16:45:45 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/600067e8a8de7700187d3d6d?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"d9ffc1d16c239521283435b7076a5b6c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn55@2020_5/2021/04/14/18-15-27-721_2f8db7b9b7ae1c01.webp","destWidth":1000,"destHeight":750,"sourceBytes":33546,"destBytes":33546,"author":"wdaniel@businessinsider.com (Will Daniel)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/6076f1ac4206150018175624?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn17@2020_5/2021/04/14/18-15-35-145_fb01185b799ad817.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn1@2020_2/2021/04/14/18-15-35-145_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=mYy_VSCGd_Y:7wUAXVGBbes:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn19@2020_1/2021/04/14/18-15-28-973_9d393bdf91ee119f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=mYy_VSCGd_Y:7wUAXVGBbes:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn65@2020_2/2021/04/14/18-15-29-769_1930571345bca80a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn29@2020_4/2021/04/14/18-15-29-996_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=mYy_VSCGd_Y:7wUAXVGBbes:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn9@2020_6/2021/04/14/18-15-36-221_ba4f557a74dc5092.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/mYy_VSCGd_Y":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn61@2020_2/2021/04/14/18-15-30-586_7c3127dad5d0c16c.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618424108841},{"createdTime":"2021-04-15 02:15:08","updatedTime":"2021-04-15 02:15:08","title":"Billionaire Jack Ma was one of China's biggest success stories.

How much? I would say probably into the $600 or $800 billion, but we haven&#39;t put all of that together yet,&#34; Capito <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iv0lo7M0VM\">told CNBC.</a></p><p>Capito laid out some potential revenue elements, including unused coronavirus relief funds, road usage fees for electric cars, and a vehicle miles-traveled tax.

Capito was part of the Republican group that pitched a $618 billion counterproposal, which Biden along with Democrats ultimately rejected.</p><p>Other Republicans are signaling they are putting together a new package. Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah told reporters on Capitol Hill Wednesday there is a bipartisan group of 20 lawmakers evenly divided between Republicans and Democrats drafting one.</p><p>Then Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/gop-infrastructure-plan-double-biden-spending-roads-bridges-cassidy-2021-4\">said on Tuesday</a> that a bipartisan group was assembling an &#34;alternative&#34; to the Biden plan.

Lanai, which is home to about 3,200 residents, is the smallest inhabited island in Hawaii and is home to serene beaches, rugged terrain, high-end resorts, as well as <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/oracle-larry-ellison-lanai-hawaii-plans-sustainability-tourism-2020-12\">Ellison&#39;s sustainability ambitions</a>, which he&#39;s executing through a development company called Pulama Lanai. </p><p>He also launched a wellness company called Sensei in 2018, which is working on three main issues: global food supply, nutrition, and sustainability.

But now, both House Democrats and House Republicans have voted to bring them back, and Senate Republicans are set to meet next Wednesday to ratify their rules and discuss earmark usage, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-13/senate-gop-nearing-decision-on-whether-to-embrace-earmarks\">according</a> to Bloomberg.</p><p>As some moderate Democrats, notably Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, stress the importance of bipartisan legislation, earmarks could be an important tactic for easing difficult legislation through congress on bipartisan lines.</p><p>Republican Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/547837-senate-gop-opens-door-to-earmarks\">told</a> The Hill on Tuesday that Democrats are already going forward with restoring earmarks, so he thinks &#34;the decision is headed toward letting every member decide if they want to participate in the earmark process.&#34;</p><p>On March 2, House Democrats <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/house-committee-introduces-new-community-project-funding-guidelines-2021-3\">introduced</a> new guidelines for earmarks to bring them back while increasing transparency and requiring members to verify they have no financial interest in the funding requests, among other things.</p><p>On March 17, House Republicans <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/earmarks-house-republicans-vote-to-approve-repeal-ban-congress-2021-3\">voted by secret ballot</a> to bring earmarks back as well. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said after the vote that there was &#34;real concern&#34; about solely the Biden administration directing where money goes.</p><p>&#34;This doesn&#39;t add one more dollar,&#34; McCarthy said. &#34;I think members here know what&#39;s most important about what&#39;s going on in their district, not Biden.&#34;</p><p>However, some Senate Republicans did not feel the same. Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah told reporters after the vote that earmarks &#34;are not the right way to go.&#34;</p><p>&#34;They have been associated with excess, and it would represent a turn to the worst,&#34; he said.</p><p>The ban on earmarks once had <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/earmarks-reinstatement-democrats-republicans-ban-2021-3\">bipartisan support</a>, as a series of scandals led to former President Barack Obama saying in 2011 that he would veto any bill containing earmarks. </p><p>A defining earmark scandal occurred in 2005, when Alaska Rep. Don Young secured $233 million for a bridge that would connect two small cities, which became known as the &#34;<a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/268303-gop-lawmaker-drops-exception-to-earmark-ban\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"60\" data-uri=\"ca965871f5c78f3d7eb1ae79d14fe9c8\">bridge to nowhere</a>,&#34; as critics said the bridge would not significantly benefit Young&#39;s community. The same year, former California Rep. Duke Cunningham landed himself eight years in prison for accepting <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trumps-pardon-largesse-a-boon-for-well-connected-fraudsters-2021-1\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"60\" data-uri=\"bc3c4263c5211854d4b9ba678f26f2d4\">$2.4 million in bribes</a> in return for promising earmarks to defense contractors.</p><p>As recently as March 1, a group of 10 Republican senators, led by Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida and Steve Daines of Montana, introduced a bill to permanently ban earmarks. Rubio said in a <a href=\"https://www.rubio.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?p=Press-Releases&id=4FDA53F0-546A-4E05-869E-7D4C24753E4F3E4F\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"80\" data-uri=\"718e2390a28896dec1fd66e59db02989\">statement</a> that earmarks had led to &#34;corruption and waste, and bought votes in Congress for unpopular legislation.&#34;</p><p>Although Republican lawmakers have <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/kristi-noem-infrastructure-pipes-south-dakota-governor-republicans-fox-news-2021-4\">largely opposed</a> President Joe Biden&#39;s infrastructure plan thus far, bringing earmarks back could help pass difficult legislation as it allows lawmakers to include funding for their specific districts in bills.</p><p>The House is already using earmarks again, and the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee is accepting member requests for community funding through April 23 .</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/earmarks-senate-republicans-ban-bring-back-community-funding-2021-4'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=VdUzrmaGCDY:kRrXAQgJl80:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=VdUzrmaGCDY:kRrXAQgJl80:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=VdUzrmaGCDY:kRrXAQgJl80:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=VdUzrmaGCDY:kRrXAQgJl80:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=VdUzrmaGCDY:kRrXAQgJl80:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=VdUzrmaGCDY:kRrXAQgJl80:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=VdUzrmaGCDY:kRrXAQgJl80:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=VdUzrmaGCDY:kRrXAQgJl80:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/VdUzrmaGCDY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 14 Apr 2021 14:34:23 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/601c299bee136f00183aa511?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"1c78ca086c9c6e4eb1daf148e5fb3491","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn80@2020_6/2021/04/14/18-15-21-074_176f309dbb69c70a.webp","destWidth":2222,"destHeight":1666,"sourceBytes":150684,"destBytes":150684,"author":"asheffey@businessinsider.com (Ayelet Sheffey)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/601c299bee136f00183aa511?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn80@2020_6/2021/04/14/18-15-21-074_176f309dbb69c70a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn1@2020_2/2021/04/14/18-15-35-145_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=VdUzrmaGCDY:kRrXAQgJl80:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn74@2020_5/2021/04/14/18-15-30-254_c60935ddc5a8d2e7.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=VdUzrmaGCDY:kRrXAQgJl80:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn77@2020_6/2021/04/14/18-15-31-992_dfec1e2cf9e4999e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn29@2020_4/2021/04/14/18-15-29-996_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=VdUzrmaGCDY:kRrXAQgJl80:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn18@2020_3/2021/04/14/18-15-33-065_39f928b3db17af7e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/VdUzrmaGCDY":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn25@2020_1/2021/04/14/18-15-31-549_c80b228381dc25a1.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618424108866},{"createdTime":"2021-04-15 02:15:08","updatedTime":"2021-04-15 02:15:08","title":"Senate Democrats want to replace most of your lost paycheck with permanently boosted unemployment benefits","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/senate-democrats-unemployment-benefits-congress-wyden-bennet-benefits-2021-4","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/6076f374420615001817562e?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Ron Wyden\" height=\"1000\" width=\"2000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Sen.

Ron Wyden of Oregon and Michael Bennet of Colorado would mandate states to replace up to 75% of a person&#39;s income at their last job. It also sets up a $250 &#34;jobseeker allowance&#34; for gig workers and contractors - essentially a weekly benefit that replaces Pandemic Unemployment Assistance so those types of workers are no longer barred from receiving state unemployment.</p><p>Gig workers have secured access to unemployment benefits in 2020 and 2021, but only on an emergency basis via the pandemic-related stimulus programs. Currently, laid-off workers are eligible under PUA for <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/stimulus-senate-democrats-broker-deal-on-unemployment-benefits-2021-3\">a $300 weekly federal unemployment benefit</a> - on top of state payouts - which is slated to end on Labor Day.</p><p>&#34;Unemployment programs are critical to helping workers stay afloat during difficult times - but too many workers still struggle to access their benefits in our patchwork of outdated state systems,&#34; Wyden said in a statement.</p><p>&#34;This proposal will protect workers by strengthening and expanding benefits, modernize UI infrastructure with needed technology investments, and prepare us for the future by tying benefits to economic conditions&#34; Bennet said.</p><p>The plan also requires states to provide a minimum 26 weeks of unemployment benefits, <a href=\"https://www.cbpp.org/research/economy/how-many-weeks-of-unemployment-compensation-are-available\">which varies greatly</a> from one state to another. An additional 13 weeks are triggered if the unemployment rate climbs above 6.5% at the national or state level, tying the flow of aid to economic conditions.  More weeks would become available if the jobless rate surges.</p><p>Under the proposal, states face some tax penalties if they break from these standards. It&#39;s unclear whether the unemployment reforms will eventually form part of Biden&#39;s infrastructure package.</p><p>Last year, state unemployment offices were overwhelmed with a surge of claims that <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-states-unemployment-insurance-programs-ended-in-disaster-2020-9\">strained their antiquated systems</a> to the brink. They struggled to implement a $600 benefit, keeping people from accessing critical aid as the economy tanked due to the pandemic. Democrats and labor advocates are seeking to modernize them to prevent similar chaos.</p><p>Most Republicans opposed the renewal of boosted federal unemployment benefits as the economy showed signs of recovering.

So far there&#39;s been no correction, but I&#39;ve lived through lots of volatility and I know, just when it seems to be safe, poo poo happens.&#34; - <em>discussing the prospect of a market crash.</em></p><p>2. &#34;GameStop&#39;s brand has way more value today than it had five months ago, before it became part of every headline around the world, day after day. Netflix saw the writing on the wall when they were mailing DVDs to everybody and said, &#39;We&#39;re going to digitize this,&#39; and they had a brand. Maybe GameStop can do the same thing.&#34;</p><p>3. &#34;If I was short GameStop stock right now, I&#39;d be worried. I think it&#39;s going to get a second kick at life. This whole social constituency supporting it - the pricing of the stock is kind of irrelevant at this point.&#34;</p><p>4. &#34;It&#39;s hilarious if you look at the volatility of Amazon over the last 20 years. You would have never owned it as it&#39;s so volatile, but in the long run it&#39;s created a trillion dollars&#39; worth of value for shareholders. Same thing is going to happen to these stocks that are going to provide digitization.&#34; - <em>underscoring the growth prospects of Zoom, Shopify, and other stocks that enable remote activities.</em></p><p>5. &#34;It&#39;s not good news for the airlines because even though they&#39;re coming back, it&#39;s all basically vacation tickets. Everybody&#39;s going to Disneyland in a big tube. That&#39;s a very crappy business, they won&#39;t make any money. Over the next two years, probably a couple of them have to go bankrupt.&#34; - <em>underscoring the challenges for airlines if business travel permanently falls by 15% or 20%.</em></p><p>6. &#34;Frankly I&#39;m not a big fan of SPACs. I do have about 20 SPACs in my portfolio right now, but only from operators that I know. A SPAC is no different than private equity, and so I need to know the team that&#39;s backing the SPAC has done deals before, knows how to buy at the right multiple, and knows how to operate. I&#39;m against the idea that some celebrity knows what they&#39;re doing in private equity, it&#39;s a joke. I avoid those like the plague, I think those are going to go to zero.&#34;</p><p>7. &#34;I&#39;m a big fan of Robinhood because even though it&#39;s got a lot of criticism, it helps 22 million people learn about stocks. I&#39;m a big believer in learning the ways of the stock market.&#34;</p><p>8. &#34;When you get into these complex straddles and collars and all of this stuff with leverage, sometimes you wake up with a hangover after going out to a party, and you forget the position you have on and you just blow yourself up. You&#39;ve got to be careful.&#34;</p><p>9. &#34;I&#39;m beyond sanctions, I want to take them right out of the financial system in North America.&#34; - <em>calling for the US to adopt a tougher stance towards China in order to level the playing field.</em></p><p>10. &#34;Elon Musk is a maverick who doesn&#39;t play by the rules, but he&#39;s actually a good example of how this relationship should work. If American companies want to go to China, they shouldn&#39;t have to give up control of their intellectual property to do that.&#34;<em><br></em></p><p>11. &#34;If you believe that burning up huge amounts of coal is detrimental and I do, you should stop buying bitcoin from the Chinese. Over time, as institutions start to really get involved in crypto, you&#39;ll have the discounted blood coin from China and you&#39;ll have the premium virgin coin with provenance - no different than blood diamonds.&#34;</p><p>12. &#34;NFTs are a derivative of the digital economy. There&#39;s merit, but as a new asset class it&#39;s going to be immensely volatile. The idea that you have something that&#39;s copyrighted in perpetuity and can&#39;t be forged is really interesting and a good idea. At the end of the day they will find their place.&#34;</p><p>13. &#34;You&#39;re pouring free money out of the sky from a helicopter into anywhere you can stuff it. But then you&#39;re raising taxes so you&#39;re taking it back right away, before it has a chance to have any effect whatsoever. You can&#39;t suck and blow at the same time, it doesn&#39;t make any sense.&#34; - <em>criticizing the Biden administration&#39;s plan to follow up its stimulus efforts by raising corporate taxes.</em></p><p>14. &#34;The idea that Yellen can <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/janet-yellen-corporate-tax-global-minimum-overhaul-oecd-treasury-2021-3\">run around the world</a> asking for a standard minimum corporate tax is a joke that&#39;s never going to happen.&#34;</p><p>15. &#34;I covet downside protection much more than outperformance. I don&#39;t care about beating the indexes at all. I don&#39;t need more money, I need to keep what I&#39;ve got.&#34;</p><p>16. &#34;Buying the dip is more rock and roll, but what invariably happens is you go through a massive correction and you learn a very important lesson. The generation that is trading right now has never gone through a sustained correction. It&#39;s coming - I don&#39;t know when, I don&#39;t know what&#39;ll trigger it, but they will learn their lesson. If you have a lot of leverage on, it&#39;s a hell of a lesson because you end up in a negative net-worth position. But you do learn from it.&#34;</p><p>17. &#34;Take 10% of your paycheck, put it away, and do not touch it except in emergencies. When you take money and burn it on a vacation, or buy some useless piece of crap you&#39;re never going to use - which many people are guilty of including me - you&#39;ve killed off your future. That money&#39;s not working for you anymore. Do you really need another pair of jeans, another pair of shoes? Just look at your closet of all the crap you don&#39;t wear, that&#39;s all money you wasted.&#34;</p><p>18. &#34;If you walk around with an Apple Watch on, that thing is a piece of consumer-electronic junk. I own Apple stock, but I would never be seen dead with an Apple Watch. Not a chance in hell.&#34; - <em>voicing his preference for wearing traditional watches and supporting conventional watchmakers.</em></p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

stories</strong></a><strong>.</strong></li>\n</ul><p>As vaccination programs across the globe begin to bite into the spread of Covid-19, retail businesses are starting to think about how they&#39;re going to welcome back customers who have saved cash during the last year&#39;s crisis.</p><p>One of the sectors looking for a new path out of the crisis is the cosmetics industry. While some sectors - like medicine, household cleaners and soap, and vitamins and supplements all saw increases in purchases during the pandemic,<a href=\"https://www.jpmorgan.com/solutions/cib/research/covid-spending-habits\"> according to JP Morgan</a>, the world cut back on cosmetics.</p><p>There are several reasons for this: as nationwide lockdowns have disrupted normal life, many people have been spending less time in front of others, and when they do, masks have made it impracticle to spend the same amount of time on facial cosmetics. Another reason is that the cosmetics industry traditionally relies on tangible, in-person sales. This is why staffed cosmetics counters are a staple of many department stores.</p><p>L&#39;Oreal is one of the largest cosmetics companies in the world, and Lubomira Rochet - who made Insider&#39;s list of <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/tb/the-list-of-300-people-transforming-business-in-europe-2020-9\">100 people transforming business in Europe</a> last year - has been tasked with navigating the firm through the pandemic. Rochet is the firm&#39;s chief digital officer, and based on widespread industry trends, the last 12 months should have been a sure-fire path to decreased profits for the company. Yet L&#39;Oreal&#39;s<a href=\"https://www.loreal-finance.com/eng/news-release/2020-annual-results\"> full-year financial results</a> for 2020, published in late February, saw things staying steady.</p><p>&#34;L&#39;Oréal has traversed this crisis in the best possible condition and has even grown stronger,&#34; Jean-Paul Agon, the company&#39;s chairman and CEO, said when revealing the results. The reason? L&#39;Oreal&#39;s forward-looking bet on e-commerce sales. &#34;Thanks to its strength in digital and e-commerce, which has again increased considerably during the crisis, L&#39;Oréal has been able to maintain a close relationship with all its consumers and compensate to a large extent for the closure of points of sale,&#34; added Agon. In all, e-commerce sales rose at L&#39;Oreal by 62% in 2020, and accounted for one dollar in every four spent with the company.</p><p>The bumper results are the payoff for a decade of work. &#34;The matter of fact is L&#39;Oreal started its transformation 10 years ago which served us well when covid hit, because we were ready,&#34; Rochet told <em>Insider</em> in mid-2020. The digitialization of the operating model for the company was crucial to making sure the firm managed to weather the crisis, but it was also one that Rochet had seen as a key area long before that.</p><p>&#34;We spent a lot adapting our marketing to the digital age,&#34; Rochet said. &#34;Investing new formats and platforms from YouTube to TikTok to Instagram to WeChat, and really completely changing our formats for faster and more interactive formats. That has been quite a journey.&#34;</p><p>But it&#39;s the way that people tend to buy their makeup that has seen the most significant transformation. &#34;We have invested in technology such as AR or VR to give [customers] an extra experience when they shop our products,&#34; said Rochet. &#34;Those are things like virtual make-up or hair colour try-ons. It&#39;s about teleconsultations that were big during covid. Those are service we propose to our consumers to enrich the experience.&#34;</p><p>Like many things, the coronavirus pandemic simply accelerated existing trends that had been in train for years. Rochet points to the rise of livestreaming sales in China as an example of how the pandemic has amplified what was already there, making it more important and significant for consumers battling the challenges of coronavirus.</p><p>And as stores and businesses begin to reopen, Rochet feels L&#39;Oreal is in a position of power. &#34;We&#39;re moving to an interesting moment where more people in a low-touch economy don&#39;t want to touch products in the store,&#34; she explained. &#34;They don&#39;t want physical testers. So we&#39;re introducing services like virtual make-up try on, through a QR code people can experience the colours and the looks, but virtually.&#34;</p><p>It&#39;s something her CEO and chairman also agrees with. Setting out 2020&#39;s financial results, Agon looked forward to 2021 with positivity. &#34;Driven by the strength of its strategic choices and a determined dynamic across the year, L&#39;Oréal has adapted to this unprecedented context and terrible pandemic with speed and agility, accelerated all of its transformations and will emerge stronger,&#34; he said.</p><p>&#34;At the beginning of this new year, which remains marked by uncertainty regarding the evolution of the pandemic, but also by consumer&#39;s appetite for beauty that remains intact across the world, we are confident in our capacity to outperform the market again this year and, subject to the evolution of the sanitary crisis, achieve a year of growth in sales and profits.&#34;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the

Johnson, CFA, CMT said he believes Lumber prices could &#34;very easily&#34; move above $1,300 per thousand board feet this year even after notching a <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/lumber-prices-hit-record-highs-soaring-past-year-2021-4-1030299977\">record high</a> in April.</p><p>That figure represents a 12% increase from Tuesday&#39;s closing price of $1,154 per thousand board feet. Lumber prices have soared more than 250% in the past year alone.</p><p>In an interview with Insider, Johnson, a technical research market strategist, said that lumber prices have broken out of a &#34;huge consolidation&#34; that occurred from 2018 through 2020 and are set to soar amid the economic reopening.</p><p>Based on technical analysis, Johnson sees lumber prices continuing to rise to at least $1,300 over the next six to nine months.</p><p>The strategist noted that there is an enormous demand for housing and renovations that&#39;s pushing lumber prices higher.</p><p> Johnson said that with interest rates as low as they are, there&#39;s an overall sense that this is the lowest mortgage rate many people are ever going to get.</p><p>As a result of these <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/coinbase-100-billion-valuation-reasonable-disruptive-firm-manhattan-venture-partners-2021-4-1030304567\">low mortgage rates</a>, a new <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/wfh-expert-economist-nick-bloom-says-future-of-work-messy-2021-4\">work-from-home trend</a>, and young people <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/millennials-gen-z-leaving-cities-for-suburbs-amid-pandemic-2020-11\">moving out of cities</a>, home buyers are lapping up properties at historic rates, and that&#39;s putting pressure on lumber supply.</p><p>Johnson also said that timber companies are struggling to catch up with demand after shutting down some of their operations during the pandemic.</p><p>The technical research strategist added that, based on what he&#39;s been reading, timber companies won&#39;t be putting more sawmills in place to meet demand either because they lack the economic incentive to add capacity.</p><p>Creating more sawmills is a capital-intensive process that requires producers to get permits, and that can&#39;t be done quickly.</p><p>Johnson also said the upcoming hurricane season could exacerbate the lumber price issue by adding to demand.</p><p>When asked what could stall rising lumber prices, Johnson said that only the slowing of economic activity would cause prices to fall, but noted that right now he believes that&#39;s unlikely as we are in the &#34;great wide open&#34; for economic growth post-pandemic.</p><p>Lumber traded up 2.7%, at roughly $1,212, as of 12:04 p.m. ET on Wednesday.</p><p><a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/commodities/lumber-price\">Watch it trade live here.</a></p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/lumber-prices-could-climb-after-hitting-record-piper-sandler-says-2021-4'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=mYm7nv4dY2E:e617nHxMyTk:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=mYm7nv4dY2E:e617nHxMyTk:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=mYm7nv4dY2E:e617nHxMyTk:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=mYm7nv4dY2E:e617nHxMyTk:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=mYm7nv4dY2E:e617nHxMyTk:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=mYm7nv4dY2E:e617nHxMyTk:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=mYm7nv4dY2E:e617nHxMyTk:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=mYm7nv4dY2E:e617nHxMyTk:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/mYm7nv4dY2E\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 14 Apr 2021 16:51:26 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/607710fc74da0300181e1a29?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"ca143bc67f80bd2821812ea08d635d95","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn55@2020_3/2021/04/14/18-15-27-819_f6775c8a32b14668.webp","destWidth":3714,"destHeight":2785,"sourceBytes":2907622,"destBytes":2907622,"author":"wdaniel@businessinsider.com (Will Daniel)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/607710e6420615001817573b?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn41@2020_6/2021/04/14/18-15-36-191_f5f14e8f37f13cac.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn1@2020_2/2021/04/14/18-15-35-145_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=mYm7nv4dY2E:e617nHxMyTk:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn54@2020_2/2021/04/14/18-15-35-719_1d3d6d754807cd56.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=mYm7nv4dY2E:e617nHxMyTk:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn45@2020_1/2021/04/14/18-15-29-625_ddd026b44c6239bd.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn29@2020_4/2021/04/14/18-15-29-996_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=mYm7nv4dY2E:e617nHxMyTk:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn2@2020_3/2021/04/14/18-15-36-017_23fc8daf46bad692.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/mYm7nv4dY2E":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn25@2020_4/2021/04/14/18-15-35-718_7db5b17697009912.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618424108839},{"createdTime":"2021-04-15 02:15:08","updatedTime":"2021-04-15 02:15:08","title":"Coinbase says the entire crypto market could be destabilized if Bitcoin's anonymous creator is ever revealed or sells their $30 billion stake","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/bitcoin-creators-30-billion-destabilize-crypto-market-coinbase-risks-2021-2","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/6037db95bed5c50011a2c72d?format=jpeg\" alt=\"brian armstrong coinbase\" height=\"1503\" width=\"2000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Christie Hemm Klok/Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>Coinbase will go public on the Nasdaq on Wednesday via a direct listing.</li>\n<li>In its February filing, the trading platform cites Satoshi Nakamoto&#39;s identity as a risk factor.</li>\n<li>The creator&#39;s cache of bitcoins could wreak havoc on the market if Nakamoto sold their collection.</li>\n<li id=\"recirc\"><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">Visit the Business section of Insider for more stories</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>Cryptocurrency trading platform Coinbase - which has a over $100 billion valuation - said Satoshi Nakamoto could topple an over <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/09/bitcoin-btc-value-exceeds-1-trillion-for-second-time.html\">$1 trillion bitcoin market.</a></p><p>Coinbase will go public on Wednesday as a direct listing on the Nasdaq.

The paper outlined the principles of a decentralized peer-to-peer digital payment system.

If Facebook is found to have violated the EU&#39;s data rules, it could face a monetary fine of up to 4% of its $86 billion global revenue.</p><p>In a <a href=\"https://www.dataprotection.ie/en/news-media/press-releases/dpc-launches-inquiry-facebook-relation-collated-dataset-facebook-user-personal-data-made-available\">statement</a>, the DPC said it believes EU data rules &#34;may have been, and/or are being, infringed in relation to Facebook Users&#39; personal data.&#34;</p><p>The personal data of over 533 million Facebook users were dumped online for free in a hacking forum earlier this month, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/stolen-data-of-533-million-facebook-users-leaked-online-2021-4\">Insider first reported</a>. The data included phone numbers that users didn&#39;t make public on their Facebook profiles, which were scraped by cybercriminals in violation of Facebook&#39;s terms of service. </p><p>A Facebook spokesperson said in a statement to Insider that the company is &#34;cooperating fully&#34; with the investigation, adding that the DPC is probing a now-patched vulnerability in a Facebook tool that made it possible to gather information about a Facebook user by entering their phone number. </p><p>&#34;We are cooperating fully with the IDPC in its enquiry, which relates to features that make it easier for people to find and connect with friends on our services. These features are common to many apps and we look forward to explaining them and the protections we have put in place,&#34; the spokesperson said.</p><p>When news of the leak first broke, Facebook said the data was scraped due to a vulnerability that the company <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/stolen-data-of-533-million-facebook-users-leaked-online-2021-4\">patched</a> in 2019, and <a href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2021/04/facts-on-news-reports-about-facebook-data/\">downplayed</a> the issue as &#34;previously reported&#34; - but the company <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-data-leak-security-experts-skeptical-2021-4\">never publicly addressed the vulnerability in detail</a> until the data dump this month.</p><p>Facebook also <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-data-leak/facebook-does-not-plan-to-notify-half-billion-users-affected-by-data-leak-idUSKBN2BU2ZY\">said</a> it does not plan to notify the hundreds of millions affected by the data breach because it&#39;s not confident that it has full knowledge of which users are affected, and because users can&#39;t take steps to fix the issue given that the data has already been published online.</p><p>The DPC investigation comes on the heels of pressure from the European Commission. Justice commissioner Didier Reynders <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dreynders/status/1381663631981617163\">said</a> on Monday that he had met with the DPC head Helen Dixon regarding the Facebook leak.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet blockquote\" data-lang=\"en\" data-cards=\"\" data-conversation=\"\">-Didier Reynders  (@dreynders) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mims/statuses/1381663631981617163?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 12, 2021</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script><p>The EU investigation will probe whether Facebook had a legal obligation to notify users and European regulators when it found and fixed the vulnerability.

None of the 19 hijackers on September 11, 2001, were from Afghanistan - though some did <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/world/wp/2018/11/30/feature/this-is-the-man-who-recruited-the-9-11-hijackers/\">train there</a>.</p><p>Twenty years after the US invasion, bin Laden was killed by Navy SEALs in Pakistan.

An annual Department of Homeland Security <a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/2020_10_06_homeland-threat-assessment.pdf\">assessment</a> released in October 2020, for example, pointed to violent white supremacy as the &#34;most persistent and lethal threat in the homeland.&#34;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5ffe3255a8de7700187d389b?format=jpeg\" alt=\"capitol siege riot ladder\" height=\"2000\" width=\"3000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Rioters clash with police using big ladder trying to enter Capitol building through the front doors.\n<p class=\"copyright\"><a href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/rioters-clash-with-police-using-big-ladder-trying-to-enter-news-photo/1230465340?adppopup=true\" target=\"_blank\">Lev Radin/Pacific Press/LightRocket via Getty Images</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>The threat from such groups was pushed to the forefront of the nation&#39;s attention via the Capitol attack on January 6 - a fatal incident that former President Donald Trump provoked with false claims about the 2020 election and that Republicans have repeatedly downplayed. </p><p>In public testimony on the Capitol insurrection to the Senate in early March, FBI Director Christopher Wray told lawmakers &#34;there&#39;s no doubt&#34; the riot &#34;included individuals that we would call militia violent extremists and in some instances, individuals that were racially motivated violent extremists who advocate for, you know, the superiority of the white race.&#34;</p><p>&#34;When it comes to racially motivated violent extremism&#34; the number of investigations and arrests &#34;has grown significantly on my watch,&#34; Wray said, adding that January 6 was not an &#34;isolated event.&#34; </p><p>&#34;The number of arrests, for example, of racially motivated violent extremists, who are what you would categorize as white supremacists, last year was almost triple the number it was in my first year as director,&#34; Wray said. &#34;The problem of domestic terrorism has been metastasizing across the country for a long time now and it is not going is a way any time soon.&#34; </p><p>Domestic terrorism incidents in the US have reached the highest levels seen in 25 years, and the surge has largely been driven by white supremacists, according to data compiled by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) and analyzed by <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/interactive/2021/domestic-terrorism-data/\">The Washington Post</a>. In 2020 alone, there were 73 domestic terrorism incidents involving far right extremists - an all-time high in CSIS&#39;s database. Meanwhile, there were 25 left-wing attacks last year. </p><p>The data showed right-wing extremists have been involved in 267 plots or attacks since 2015, leading to 91 fatalities.

But Burns also said that Al Qaeda and ISIS currently lack the ability to attack the homeland and aren&#39;t the most dangerous transnational terror groups anymore. &#34;There are terrorist groups that represent much more serious threats,&#34; Burns told the Senate Intelligence Committee.</p><p>Along these lines, Biden has apparently concluded that while there are risks in withdrawing, they&#39;re relatively small and the costs of remaining in Afghanistan would be far greater. </p><p>As <a href=\"https://twitter.com/msnbc/status/1382364034020823042?s=21\">Biden was expected to say</a> in remarks on the planned withdrawal on Wednesday, the US &#34;cannot continue the cycle of extending or expanding our military presence in Afghanistan hoping to create the ideal conditions for our withdrawal, expecting a different result.&#34;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/gop-biden-afghanistan-withdrawal-aids-terrorism-us-intelligence-homegrown-extremism-2021-4'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=KostNJR1kVM:zD6_mkuA9ks:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=KostNJR1kVM:zD6_mkuA9ks:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=KostNJR1kVM:zD6_mkuA9ks:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=KostNJR1kVM:zD6_mkuA9ks:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=KostNJR1kVM:zD6_mkuA9ks:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=KostNJR1kVM:zD6_mkuA9ks:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=KostNJR1kVM:zD6_mkuA9ks:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=KostNJR1kVM:zD6_mkuA9ks:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/KostNJR1kVM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 14 Apr 2021 18:11:10 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5fc6ca5d50e71a001155851e?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"9f84ae6f7a6cabb9304b8714543e75b6","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn100@2020_4/2021/04/14/18-15-27-900_365575f16c5daa7e.webp","destWidth":1842,"destHeight":1382,"sourceBytes":133478,"destBytes":133478,"author":"insider@insider.com (John Haltiwanger)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/607727a742061500181757a2?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn73@2020_4/2021/04/14/18-15-35-881_91b2e457476e5b73.webp","https://i.insider.com/5ffe3255a8de7700187d389b?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn22@2020_5/2021/04/14/18-15-35-531_a55e1d92fa875fec.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn1@2020_2/2021/04/14/18-15-35-145_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=KostNJR1kVM:zD6_mkuA9ks:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn97@2020_1/2021/04/14/18-15-35-205_2919f93a93e7a980.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=KostNJR1kVM:zD6_mkuA9ks:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn55@2020_4/2021/04/14/18-15-28-171_7fa58ba0ffe020f0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn29@2020_4/2021/04/14/18-15-29-996_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=KostNJR1kVM:zD6_mkuA9ks:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn38@2020_6/2021/04/14/18-15-35-673_63b3c330865a7a83.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/KostNJR1kVM":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn21@2020_3/2021/04/14/18-15-36-013_1c55444cb3431b7e.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618424108841},{"createdTime":"2021-04-15 02:15:08","updatedTime":"2021-04-15 02:15:08","title":"The Biden administration reportedly spent months preparing for an inflation spike that hasn't come yet -

The president <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/joe-biden-stimulus-plan-details-checks-congress-direct-payments-unemployment-2021-1\">unveiled a $1.9 trillion relief proposal</a> in January, pitching the plan as an additional boost for the US economic recovery.

Still, the stimulus push wasn&#39;t without some trepidation. A handful of officials in the Treasury Department spent several months modeling how Americans would deploy new fiscal support, and whether any outcome could lead to stifling inflation, according to The Times. Treasury Secretary and former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen even helped create the models.</p><p>Their observations were encouraging and lend new support to Biden&#39;s latest spending proposal. The team tested a range of potentialities for how quickly Americans would spend stimulus, where they would deploy cash, and how the labor market&#39;s recovery would affect inflation. Yet no outcome saw inflation charge out of the Fed&#39;s control and risk a new recession, the Times reported.</p><p>The findings have been hinted at in statements from the White House and the Treasury in recent weeks. Long-term scarring in the labor market poses a greater risk than inflation, Yellen told ABC&#39;s &#34;This Week&#34; in March. Economic reopening is expected to drive a jump in prices, but the effects will likely be temporary and fail to drive sustained inflation, she added.</p><p>The administration&#39;s Council of Economic Advisors mirrored Yellen in a Monday <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/blog/2021/04/12/pandemic-prices-assessing-inflation-in-the-months-and-years-ahead/\">blog post</a>. A temporary rise in inflation is consistent with trends seen after other major events like wars or past labor-market rebounds, economists Ernie Tedeschi and Jared Bernstein said. The White House will continue to monitor consumer prices, but it expects inflation to fade as actual price growth &#34;runs more in line with longer-run expectations,&#34; they added.</p><p>Fed Chair Jerome Powell has repeatedly backed up such an outlook. The central bank chief said last month that the Fed will &#34;<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/fed-jerome-powell-inflation-patient-stimulus-treasury-yields-reopening-monetarypolicy-2021-3\">be patient</a>&#34; in monitoring inflation and eventually lifting interest rates. The most likely scenario during the recovery is that prices move higher but fail to stay elevated as the country enters a new sense of normalcy, Powell said in early March.</p><p>Although the Fed operates independently from the executive branch and doesn&#39;t play a role in fiscal spending, officials testing inflation scenarios told the Times that the Biden administration trusts the Fed to intervene and stave off price growth should it accelerate faster than expected.</p><p>The latest data signals the country is far from any sort of inflation scare. The Consumer Price Index - a popular gauge of overall inflation - <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/inflation-consumer-price-index-march-economic-reopening-federal-reserve-powell-2021-4\">rose 0.6% in March</a> as stimulus, reopening, and vaccination fueled stronger economic activity. Economists expected a 0.5% gain.</p><p>Consumer prices rose 2.6% year-over-year, also exceeding estimates. The measure is skewed somewhat by year-ago data, since prices initially dropped when the pandemic first slammed the US economy. Those readings present a lower bar for year-over-year inflation. Though the data points to stronger inflation, price growth still has a ways to go before it trends at the Fed&#39;s above-2% level and warrants serious concern.</p><p>That opening paves the way for additional spending. Biden unveiled a $2.3 trillion infrastructure proposal late last month that includes funds for nationwide broadband, improved roads and bridges, and affordable housing. The package is expected to be spent over eight years, compared to the weeks-long rollout seen with much of Biden&#39;s stimulus plan. Such long-term deployment would present little inflationary risk, and Biden has portrayed the plan as an investment in American industry, jobs, and research as opposed to an emergency relief measure.</p><p>The March uptick in inflation, however, does signal that price growth is trending higher. Future CPI readings are set to be closely watched releases as the administration balances its spending goals with a red-hot economy. Economists and officials are anticipating stronger inflation. How price growth trends from there will determine whether the Biden administration was successful or created new risks.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/biden-stimulus-inflation-risk-modeling-treasury-department-federal-reserve-infrastructure-2021-4'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=oZ-q9rrXmjA:rzRrxUOe8fc:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=oZ-q9rrXmjA:rzRrxUOe8fc:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=oZ-q9rrXmjA:rzRrxUOe8fc:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=oZ-q9rrXmjA:rzRrxUOe8fc:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=oZ-q9rrXmjA:rzRrxUOe8fc:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=oZ-q9rrXmjA:rzRrxUOe8fc:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=oZ-q9rrXmjA:rzRrxUOe8fc:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=oZ-q9rrXmjA:rzRrxUOe8fc:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/oZ-q9rrXmjA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 14 Apr 2021 17:06:05 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/6076f01874da0300181e191e?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"a6b6b03df83544fb4393d0dc974a3dae","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn87@2020_4/2021/04/14/18-15-28-310_e2e5c0a742d16916.webp","destWidth":5118,"destHeight":3839,"sourceBytes":469572,"destBytes":469572,"author":"bwinck@businessinsider.com (Ben Winck)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/6076f00974da0300181e191d?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn73@2020_5/2021/04/14/18-15-35-023_b26d61c41e0b9875.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn1@2020_2/2021/04/14/18-15-35-145_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=oZ-q9rrXmjA:rzRrxUOe8fc:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn29@2020_5/2021/04/14/18-15-29-552_40322d3e6f7ba89a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=oZ-q9rrXmjA:rzRrxUOe8fc:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn85@2020_2/2021/04/14/18-15-32-192_54ed03b73f5d922a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn29@2020_4/2021/04/14/18-15-29-996_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=oZ-q9rrXmjA:rzRrxUOe8fc:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn36@2020_6/2021/04/14/18-15-28-704_5a1342d09970591e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/oZ-q9rrXmjA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn24@2020_3/2021/04/14/18-15-28-089_579af9a8b205ce56.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618424108838},{"createdTime":"2021-04-15 02:15:08","updatedTime":"2021-04-15 02:15:08","title":"Coinbase CEO says regulation and cybersecurity are 2 of the biggest threats to cryptocurrency","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/coinbase-regulation-big-threat-crypto-brian-armstrong-2021-4","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/6076ed5774da0300181e1906?format=jpeg\" alt=\"brian armstrong coinbase\" height=\"1996\" width=\"2662\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Coinbase Founder and CEO Brian Armstrong attends Consensus 2019 at the Hilton Midtown on May 15, 2019 in New York City.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Steven Ferdman/Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said regulation is &#34;right up there with cybersecurity&#34; in crypto risks.</li>\n<li>Coinbase is about to be the first and largest cryptocurrency firm to go public.</li>\n<li>But as Coinbase makes it market debut, Armstrong said scrutiny of the company may mount.</li>\n<li id=\"recirc\"><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">See more stories on Insider&#39;s business page</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said two of the biggest risks to cryptocurrency are cybersecurity and regulation.</p><p>The executive spoke with <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/14/coinbase-ceo-says-regulation-is-one-of-the-biggest-threats-to-crypto.html\">CNBC</a> on Wednesday ahead of his company&#39;s public debut via a direct listing.

Suddenly, we were ordering more online: our groceries, our home office setups, our bread ingredients, our puzzles. When we did face this new, mysterious virus to go into a store, we were met with empty shelves and freshly printed signs telling us we couldn&#39;t buy more than two jugs of milk. Sales of toilet paper in the US <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/why-toilet-paper-demand-spiked-845-how-companies-kept-up-2020-5\">shot up 845%</a>, demand for Clorox products <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/demand-clorox-products-500-percent-when-can-we-expect-see-n1250868\">spiked by 500%</a>, and treadmill sales <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/road-to-recovery/2021/01/07/home-fitness-boom/\">more than doubled</a>.</p><p>As we depended on our supply chain more, we criticized it more. After all, how hard could it be to just make some more toilet paper?</p><p>As consumers, we focused on the supply side of the equation. But Kain said for the professionals, supply problems haven&#39;t been the story for much of the pandemic - demand shift has. </p><p>&#34;Demand shifted so dramatically, sometimes 50% or 100% compared to forecast,&#34; Kain said. &#34;The supply really got constrained, right? If the demand had not shifted, the supply side would have been difficult, but it would still have been flowing really, really well.</p><p>&#34;Many [journalists] say, &#39;But why don&#39;t they just make more?&#39; I&#39;m like, &#39;Well, guess what, you need equipment to make more toilet tissue, and where do you get the equipment from?&#39; A lot of times, from China. But even if you use a local equipment maker, they need spare parts from all over the world and it just takes time to deploy it.&#34;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f08b5ca4dca6827d46b2106?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Toilet paper production\" height=\"1080\" width=\"1920\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The US saw demand spikes as the pandemic took hold, and toilet paper sales shot up 845%.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Kain said demand changed in two important ways: which products people bought and, as people shifted even more of their purchasing online, which channels they bought them through.</p><p>Mei Yee Pang, the Singapore-based head of DHL Asia Pacific Innovation, saw similar patterns, illustrating a common theme of the pandemic: how intertwined supply chains are, for better and for worse. </p><p>&#34;Supply chains today are so global, you see pretty much the same phenomena everywhere we go,&#34; Pang told Insider. &#34;We too had our toilet paper issues. There was, at some point in time, a global shortage of glassware because everybody started making jams at home and needed glass jars.</p><p>&#34;So we do see very interesting demand shapes, and a lot of them, looking back, are something that we can expect. That&#39;s where big data potentially in the future can come in more, better forecasting some of these effects that we normally wouldn&#39;t have expected.&#34;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f19f697988ee365d85aabe5?format=jpeg\" alt=\"costco cart toilet paper kirkland\" height=\"3024\" width=\"4032\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The production of toilet paper came into the spotlight during the shortages, with many asking why companies couldn&#39;t just make more. Experts told Insider it wasn&#39;t that easy.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Shutterstock</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Changing demand isn&#39;t the only issue the pandemic highlighted. More online ordering didn&#39;t just mean more convenience for the buyer - it meant more waste, too.</p><p>&#34;Every time I receive a parcel, I feel bad about it because I&#39;m contributing to waste,&#34; Pang said. &#34;I think this is something that needs to change. We can&#39;t be sending individual shipments using partially utilized vehicles to send stuff around to individual homes.</p><p>&#34;It&#39;s not easy, but I think as we go more and more from a less than 20% e-commerce channel to now, some companies are having that switch around to e-commerce as a major channel, we are going to see a lot of waste coming into play and it&#39;s not sustainable.&#34;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f120a094dca684e5a7e0e93?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Cargo planes\" height=\"1660\" width=\"2500\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>As many places shifted to quarantine, consumers&#39; online ordering habits expanded.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Oed/ullstein bild/Getty</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Kain thinks the switch to e-commerce is here to stay, but said there&#39;s &#34;no easy solution&#34; to making the change more sustainable from a packaging perspective. </p><p>&#34;If we go to things like consumer electronics, everything was packaged for the retail shelves,&#34; Kain said. &#34;Maybe now you have a shippable box, and you don&#39;t have a box inside a box.</p><p>&#34;We are a little bit in a tough spot right now because recycling and return packaging is of course a big issue because of the risk of infection. I think this is something that we&#39;ve got to develop over time, but I do think that the big carriers are going to come out with support in this area.&#34;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fea2cd7a64488001819386e?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Mailed packages on front porch\" height=\"1414\" width=\"2121\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>A stack of delivered packages and boxes sit outside a front door.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Jennifer J Taylor/Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Pang, whose employer DHL is one of those big carriers with <a href=\"https://www.dhl.com/content/g0/en/about_us/company_portrait.html#:~:text=DHL%20is%20present%20in%20over,infinite%20number%20of%20logistics%20needs.\">more than</a> 350,000 employees worldwide, said analytics will help. </p><p>&#34;In our organization, we start looking at how we can help our customers look at packaging and use data information to optimize the way we pack, the way we pelletize,&#34; Pang said. &#34;Every small bit counts to really reducing our footprint, and at the same time, lowers cost. So what&#39;s not to like about this sort of solution?&#34;</p><p>Peter Evans, CEO of the UK-based sustainable supply chain technology company Orderly, told Insider his company&#39;s main product is something called a &#34;scorecard.&#34; Its goals include <a href=\"https://www.derby.ac.uk/business-services/funding-services-and-support/access-to-funding/case-studies/orderly---technology/\">reducing waste of both products and packaging</a>.</p><p>&#34;It rates everyone who manages supply chain operations, from someone in a warehouse to the CEO, on a scale of zero to five,&#34; Evans said. &#34;Zero being &#39;You&#39;re wrecking the planet and you&#39;re wrecking your business,&#39; five being &#39;You&#39;re really making some decent change here.&#39; We use AI against all this data we pull in to give each person two recommendations each week on what they can do to provide the biggest, most sustainable impact to their supply chain.</p><p>&#34;For us, it&#39;s changing people&#39;s mindsets on an individual level, showing them what can be done in the world as well - what can create the biggest benefit.&#34;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fd7a64fe00bce00188bb33b?format=jpeg\" alt=\"ups employee packages delivery\" height=\"681\" width=\"1024\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>A UPS employee delivers packages.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Noam Galai/Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Kain said that&#39;s important, both in terms of sustainability and social responsibility, as more people think about their relationships with companies.</p><p>&#34;Corporate social responsibility has become way more important for decision makers,&#34; Kain said. &#34;It&#39;s driven by consumers. We want companies to be in sync with our values. We don&#39;t want them to be out of sync.</p><p>&#34;For instance, early in the pandemic, there was a survey done in the US showing 87% of consumers did not want to buy product from companies that did not keep their workers safe. We&#39;ve never seen sentiments like this before, and it&#39;s very healthy and good. It&#39;s forcing the corporations to think differently about their supply chain in a very healthy manner. In any crisis, there&#39;s a silver lining, and I think that&#39;s it.&#34;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fbd2b8f32f2170011f70e16?format=jpeg\" alt=\"amazon package logo warehouse\"

Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Another silver lining might be that when or if this kind of global crisis happens again, the supply chain will be a bit more prepared for what&#39;s coming - thanks, in part, to how big of a spotlight its struggles received when the pandemic hit.</p><p>&#34;I think there&#39;s a newfound respect for the sector, from the boardroom to the individual consumers at home,&#34; Pang said. &#34;There&#39;s a newfound priority placed on the sector to put in more technology, to put in more innovation, to put in more R&#38;D into making it more agile and more prepared for situations like this, so I&#39;m quite optimistic about what we can see from the sector in the next few years.&#34;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

The President&#39;s smile and the mood of the theater relaxed the young boy. Until a shot rang out. Strangely, the 5-year-old Seymour was very concerned about the man who appeared to have fallen from the balcony of the theater in the middle of the performance. He had no idea someone had been shot, let alone that it was President Lincoln.</p><p>&#34;Pandemonium&#34; then swept through the theater, Seymour recalled, as his nurse hurried the boy out of the theater. He heard calls of &#34;Lincoln&#39;s shot! The President is dead!&#34;</p><p>The man, of course, was Lincoln&#39;s assassin, John Wilkes Booth. Booth waited until the play&#39;s funniest line when the shot would be masked by the sound of laughter. Booth calmly walked into the President&#39;s booth, barred the door, and fired a single shot into the President, who was laughing at the line.</p><p>Union Army Maj. Henry Rathbone, who accompanied Lincoln that night with their wives, fought Booth for his single-shot derringer and was stabbed for his effort. His constant wrangling with Booth caused the assassin&#39;s boot spur to get tangled in the flag as he jumped from the President&#39;s box. This is why Booth landed awkwardly on his leg.</p><p>Many in the crowd were confused. Not everyone heard the shot, and many thought it was still part of the play. Little Samuel Seymour didn&#39;t understand it either.</p><p>&#34;I saw Lincoln slumped forward in his seat,&#34; the old man said. &#34;That night I was shot 50 times, at least, in my dreams - and I sometimes relive the horror of Lincoln&#39;s assassination, dozing in my rocker as an old codger like me is bound to do.&#34;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/interview-with-the-last-living-witness-of-the-lincoln-assassination-2019-7'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=mKlW6tHaHwg:3sM4KXOts2k:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=mKlW6tHaHwg:3sM4KXOts2k:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=mKlW6tHaHwg:3sM4KXOts2k:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=mKlW6tHaHwg:3sM4KXOts2k:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=mKlW6tHaHwg:3sM4KXOts2k:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=mKlW6tHaHwg:3sM4KXOts2k:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=mKlW6tHaHwg:3sM4KXOts2k:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=mKlW6tHaHwg:3sM4KXOts2k:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/mKlW6tHaHwg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 14 Apr 2021 15:24:16 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5d1a39a2a17d6c083f4163c9?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"8aefa81733d46343ec268a08a024da8f","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn35@2020_1/2021/04/14/18-15-27-715_0a373346ff38ab57.webp","destWidth":1400,"destHeight":1050,"sourceBytes":231784,"destBytes":231784,"author":"insider@insider.com (Blake Stilwell)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5d1a38dfa17d6c08b50b3282?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn78@2020_1/2021/04/14/18-15-35-018_ac6a996859c97d28.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn1@2020_2/2021/04/14/18-15-35-145_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=mKlW6tHaHwg:3sM4KXOts2k:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn29@2020_1/2021/04/14/18-15-31-591_e97f9164fde4be89.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=mKlW6tHaHwg:3sM4KXOts2k:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn89@2020_2/2021/04/14/18-15-35-327_0b6e8f03453b5a37.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn29@2020_4/2021/04/14/18-15-29-996_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=mKlW6tHaHwg:3sM4KXOts2k:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn14@2020_2/2021/04/14/18-15-36-326_4717ef5465d174d4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/mKlW6tHaHwg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn77@2020_4/2021/04/14/18-15-29-272_02d972df5b3c6938.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618424108858},{"createdTime":"2021-04-15 02:15:08","updatedTime":"2021-04-15 02:15:08","title":"The real reason we still haven't cloned humans","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/ethics-of-human-cloning-scientific-progress-2020-7","description":"<div style=\"position:relative; overflow:hidden; padding-bottom:56.25%\">\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/players/VJznL6Za-jZbcmOYf.html\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" style=\"position:absolute;\" allow=\"fullscreen\"></iframe>\n</div><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>We&#39;ve technically been able to <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/ap-scientists-successfully-clone-monkeys-are-humans-up-next-2018-1\">clone human beings</a> for almost a decade.</li>\n<li>So, why haven&#39;t we?

But as far as we know, no one&#39;s actually cloned a whole person. Turns out, ethics aren&#39;t the only thing holding scientists back. Cloning isn&#39;t the sci-fi marvel we think it is. It can be dangerous, often ineffective, and, most of all, we just haven&#39;t thought of a good enough reason to do it. So, here&#39;s why you&#39;ll probably never have to fight your evil clone.</p><p>This is Dolly. Just kidding, that&#39;s a regular sheep. This is Dolly, the first mammal cloned successfully from an adult cell. She was born in 1996 after scientists figured out how to remove the DNA from the egg cell of a Scottish Blackface sheep and basically replace it with the DNA of a mammary cell from a Finn Dorset sheep. They gave it a little electric shock to fuse the cell and get it replicating, placed the cells in the uterus of another sheep, and boom, clone. This method, called reproductive cloning, could theoretically be used on humans. But this is a best-case scenario. It took 277 tries for the scientists to get one Dolly. Nowadays, cloning mammals generally has a success rate of about 10% to 20%. Better than one in 277, but still a majorly inefficient process.</p><p><strong>Jose Cibelli:</strong> Technically, it&#39;s not difficult to produce a clone embryo, but human cloning has other hurdles that need to be considered.</p><p><strong>Narrator:</strong> To even research human cloning, scientists would need to ethically collect a large amount of donated eggs and find enough surrogates to carry them. But even if they made it through that logistical nightmare, the biggest issue is this:</p><p><strong>Cibelli:</strong> They&#39;re gonna hurt the baby, or they&#39;re gonna hurt the person carrying the cloned fetus.</p><p><strong>Narrator:</strong> Across the board, scientists have found that some embryos expire before they&#39;re implanted. Others result in miscarriages. And those that make it to term often die soon after birth or end up with severe abnormalities. Simply, these are risks that are easier to take when it comes to experimenting with sheep than with people. But arguably the biggest reason we haven&#39;t cloned a human being? There&#39;s not a good enough reason to.</p><p>In pop culture, cloning is used to bring people back from the dead. But that&#39;s not how it works. Cloning someone would only create a twin, not a replica, since identical twins have the same genetics, but not necessarily personalities. And a &#34;Never Let Me Go&#34; scenario, where organs are harvested from clones to save the rich, is not only unethical, but unnecessary. Why clone an entire person when you can just make the part you need? Something, theoretically, therapeutic cloning can solve.</p><p>Therapeutic cloning is almost identical to reproductive, except the cloned embryo is never implanted in a uterus. Instead, the embryo is cloned for the sole purpose of extracting stem cells. Stem cells have the incredible ability to turn into any other cell in the human body, which means they&#39;re great for developing new treatments for disease and have the potential to repair or regenerate tissues and organs.</p><p>But, no surprise, there are a lot of downsides with therapeutic cloning. The thing about stem cells is that they&#39;re a pretty limited resource. The most substantial source for embryonic stem cells? Three- to five-day-old embryos, cloned or otherwise. And when someone else&#39;s stem cells are transplanted into a patient, the body will sometimes fight them off like a disease. Some researchers believe that cloned stem cells, since they share the patient&#39;s DNA, would be less likely to be rejected. But this use case is still in the research stage.</p><p>And, finally, therapeutic cloning is an individualized treatment in a world where drug companies are more interested in standardized ones. And there are easier ways to create multipurpose cells nowadays, like the method for creating induced pluripotent stem cells. They&#39;re basically adult cells that have been reprogrammed to be a different type of cell.</p><p><strong>Cibelli:</strong> The problem with therapeutic cloning, of course, is that you need a lab personnel that is qualified to do it, specific equipment to do it. Whereas the other technique, you can just buy a kit and one person can do it in a lab that has some expertise in tissue culture.</p><p><strong>Narrator:</strong> Cloned cells still have an advantage when it comes to healthier mitochondria and the ability to grow into entire animals, whereas iPSCs often peter out. But since iPSCs safely and reliably do most everything but create entire living animals, why fund the harder, ethically ambiguous thing? So, cloning might actually have a bigger place in movies than it does in real life, because the money just isn&#39;t there. And just because we can do something doesn&#39;t mean we need to.</p><p><strong>Ian:</strong> Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn&#39;t stop to think if they should.</p><p><strong>Abby Tang:</strong> So, in the research for this video, I did come across one very interesting tidbit, and that is the announcement of cloned human baby Eve, who was born on December 26, 2002. And the source of this announcement is a company called Clonaid, which was formed in 1997 by the Raelian cult. And they&#39;re a cult that believes that humans were cloned from aliens and the only way for us to reach immortality is to clone ourselves. It&#39;s been 18 years, and we haven&#39;t gotten any proof that baby Eve exists or has ever existed, but the company is still alive and well. So if any proof does come through, we will update you. </p><p><em>EDITOR&#39;S NOTE: This video was originally published in July 2020.</em></p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/ethics-of-human-cloning-scientific-progress-2020-7'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=XcxbsWyUdss:7i0xF2beM5M:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=XcxbsWyUdss:7i0xF2beM5M:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=XcxbsWyUdss:7i0xF2beM5M:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=XcxbsWyUdss:7i0xF2beM5M:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=XcxbsWyUdss:7i0xF2beM5M:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=XcxbsWyUdss:7i0xF2beM5M:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=XcxbsWyUdss:7i0xF2beM5M:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=XcxbsWyUdss:7i0xF2beM5M:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/XcxbsWyUdss\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 14 Apr 2021 18:04:55 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5efe29743f737049ee49ab83?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"46cbc4aef76cb401119757a47e038341","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn87@2020_1/2021/04/14/18-15-27-715_d885f4e8af26ae20.webp","destWidth":1440,"destHeight":1080,"sourceBytes":354368,"destBytes":354368,"author":"atang@businessinsider.com (Abby Tang,Michelle Yan Huang,Victoria Barranco)","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn1@2020_2/2021/04/14/18-15-35-145_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=XcxbsWyUdss:7i0xF2beM5M:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn84@2020_2/2021/04/14/18-15-28-647_2ffff22de4841fec.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=XcxbsWyUdss:7i0xF2beM5M:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn34@2020_6/2021/04/14/18-15-29-986_31b55f9809afea5b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn29@2020_4/2021/04/14/18-15-29-996_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=XcxbsWyUdss:7i0xF2beM5M:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn65@2020_2/2021/04/14/18-15-36-109_005302eb01559e41.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/XcxbsWyUdss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn29@2020_4/2021/04/14/18-15-32-368_f3e617d76e55e1a6.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618424108849},{"createdTime":"2021-04-15 02:15:08","updatedTime":"2021-04-15 02:15:08","title":"Luxury items like watches and jewelry are getting even more expensive","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/price-of-luxury-items-watch-jewelry-increases-more-expensive-2021-4","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f64d365323fc4001e0d71ab?format=jpeg\" alt=\"luxury jewelry covid\" height=\"1333\" width=\"2000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\"><a href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/shop-manager-giulia-pietersen-checks-jewellery-items-at-an-news-photo/1213459615?adppopup=true\" target=\"_blank\">Miguel Medina/AFP via Getty Images</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>The cost of goods in the US saw its largest monthly increase since 2012.</li>\n<li>Jewelry and watches were among several items that saw a significant price boost.</li>\n<li>Prices are expected to continue rising in the coming months as vaccination levels increase.</li>\n<li id=\"recirc\"><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">See more stories on Insider&#39;s business page</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>Luxury items became even more expensive last month as the price of goods in the US saw its highest monthly increase in nearly 9 years, according to the US Bureau and Labor Statistics&#39; <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.t02.htm\">Consumer Price Index.</a></p><p>Jewelry and watches were among several items that pushed the overall surge in prices.

This directly adds flexibility and agility. Small teams can move quickly.</p><p>Amazon&#39;s two-pizza teams are agile, developed flexible inter-team structures, offer clarity or purpose, and are fast to innovate. They are also highly autonomous: the Prime Now team was able to launch its pilot on the iPhone first even though Amazon is generally an Android company. When the workload for a team becomes too big, Amazon may decide to break it into multiple smaller teams to keep their agility.</p><p>But teams mostly form because an employee sees an opportunity - a big one like Prime Now or one of the countless smaller ones. That employee is free to seek support and sponsorship inside or outside his own current team.  </p><p>How that happens at Amazon seems quite different from most companies, which have clearly defined chains of command. For an idea to be implemented, it must move up the chain of command to the point where management is senior enough to act. If a decision involves financial resources or legal issues, those accountants and lawyers will need to be consulted. And all the way along, there are endless opportunities for vetoes. Often, one veto kills the project. </p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60672ccfa7d803001963e704?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Behemoth Cover\" height=\"939\" width=\"618\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Behemoth: Amazon Rising.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Robin Gaster</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><h2><strong>In contrast, Amazon offers &#34;multiple paths to yes,&#34; as Bezos puts it. </strong></h2><p>Individuals can go outside their team or even their division to find a team interested in an idea. Teams can find any number of senior managers to sponsor and support a project.</p><p>Amazon has sometimes been called the &#34;company of 100 CEOs,&#34; because there are so many possible pathways to greenlighting a project. It&#39;s not that Amazon makes innovation easy. It&#39;s never easy. But Amazon&#39;s structure is designed to get to yes.</p><p>Think of these proto-teams - ideas without even a team yet - as the seeds for 1,000 flowers that many eventually bloom. Amazon is diligent about fertilizing the soil and watering them with resources, in the sure knowledge that many - perhaps most - will fail.</p><p>These proto-teams - often even a single employee - are watered with enough resources to initially test whether there is something worth pursuing; that may be time off task to work on the idea, some hours or days from other team members, possibly other resources.</p><p>This period is pre-pilot. As described above, innovators start by working backwards to develop a clear vision of what the project is for, who it will serve, and why specifically customers will benefit. As it comes into focus, and more evidence is added that the project is worth pursuing, it may attract more resources from inside and outside the original team. That might include part-time help from other areas like logistics or human resources or advertising.</p><p>At this stage, the project is adding resources with dotted lines from existing structures. An HR person may be helping to acquire talent, but they remain within their existing HR team. Further information resources are easily available because of Amazon&#39;s previous decision to manage information flows via API; emerging teams can access information without needing permission.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60672de3a7d803001963e70d?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Robin Gaster Headshot\" height=\"2400\" width=\"3200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Robin Gaster.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Regis Lefebure</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>At some point, the project/team gets the greenlight to move into pilot production. That will require significantly more resources, and the creation of a more focused team. Neil Ackerman explains that when he was starting to build a team for his Small and Light Fulfillment project, he searched for the team members he would need through the internal Amazon directory, and reached out to them for &#34;many many meetings for coffee&#34; over weeks of effort. Of the seven people he eventually asked to join the new team, three accepted, and he hired four from outside. </p><h2>As the project becomes more successful, its place in the overall Amazon hierarchy becomes more settled. </h2><p>It is no longer a pilot on an experiment; it&#39;s now a service within existing services. So Ackerman&#39;s Small and Light project became embedded as a successful tool for addressing the needs of the Marketplace. Over time, it attracted further use from Amazon Retail, and it&#39;s now a permanent service within the Amazon logistics network, reporting up through that chain of command, and funded through the standard OP1 mechanism. As projects solidify, teams become fully independent entities within the Amazon ecosystem. They have their own marketing, sales, engineering, and finance functions, so each product has its own profit-and-loss statement, and thus each has both autonomy and accountability.</p><p>So what&#39;s different here, and what differences does it make?</p><p>The main difference is that Amazon&#39;s internal environment is set up to encourage the constant formation of teams, and provides the critical early resources that let them flourish quickly. Management expects and even demands innovation, and the structure is set up to provide enough fertilizer at the earliest stages, sufficient support during the prototyping and testing phase, and enough clear pathways to final adoption. There are far fewer vetoes, and more widely distributed resources and pathways. And that matters. As Benedict Evans observes,</p><p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>The structural advantage of them [teams], in Amazon at least (and in theory, at least) is that you can multiply them. You can add new product lines without adding new internal structure or direct reports, and you can add them without meetings and projects and process in the logistics and ecommerce platforms. You don&#39;t (in theory) need to fly to Seattle and schedule a bunch of meetings to get people to implement support for launching makeup in Italy, or persuade anyone to add things to their roadmap. This means not so much that products on Amazon are commodities (this is obvious) but that product categories on Amazon are commodities. </em>-Benedict Evans</p><p>Of course, this picture is somewhat idealized. Small teams also compete for resources and projects, so from another perspective Amazon has created a Darwinian environment in which teams compete vigorously (sometimes viciously) on behalf of their projects and initiatives. Not everything gets funded, so there are naturally winners and losers. This hyper-competitive environment is another way Amazon pushes teams to innovate. </p><p>One final note. Small teams are only possible because Amazon has, since its earliest days, required that all teams share information electronically not only with other Amazon teams, but with outsiders as well.  This key requirement makes it possible for hundreds of teams to connect - otherwise they would drown in information overhead, the sheer time and resource cost of communicating by manual methods like email and messaging. </p><p><em>Excerpt from <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Behemoth-Amazon-Rising-Power-Seduction-ebook/dp/B08P3HQFZX\">Behemoth - Amazon Rising: Power and Seduction in the Age of Amazon</a> reprinted with permission by Dr. Robin Gaster.</em></p><p><em>Dr. Robin Gaster is the CEO of Incumetrics and a visiting scholar at George Washington University Institute for Public Policy.

According to the Federal Reserve, <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/HNOCESQ027S\">American households bought roughly $211 billion in individual stocks</a> last year.</p><p>Whether that trend of individual stock ownership will continue could depend on the investor fanbase that companies build, and Clubhouse is one avenue executives are using to get closer to retail investors. </p><p>Though a recent note from JPMorgan&#39;s global markets strategy team says that US retail investors are rotating away from buying individual stocks and stock options and towards buying more traditional equity funds, as was the case before the pandemic. <br><br>During the first week of April, stock ETFs saw strong inflows of $18 billion, JPMorgan noted. Meanwhile, measures of call option buying that rose to a record high in January have begun to subside over the past two months, a sign that retail investors are less willing to invest in call options on individual stocks. Similarly, JPMorgan found that equity baskets containing stocks popular with US retail trading platforms have also slowed over the past two months. </p><p>JPMorgan noted that monitoring retail flows into equity funds will be an important metric for determining the state of the individual stockholder.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-market-outlook-clubhouse-retail-investing-indiviudal-shareholder-carparts-2021-4'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=KaqcHqJ9YRQ:Rb0k-zHcp98:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=KaqcHqJ9YRQ:Rb0k-zHcp98:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=KaqcHqJ9YRQ:Rb0k-zHcp98:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=KaqcHqJ9YRQ:Rb0k-zHcp98:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=KaqcHqJ9YRQ:Rb0k-zHcp98:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=KaqcHqJ9YRQ:Rb0k-zHcp98:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=KaqcHqJ9YRQ:Rb0k-zHcp98:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=KaqcHqJ9YRQ:Rb0k-zHcp98:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/KaqcHqJ9YRQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 14 Apr 2021 15:44:30 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/607201daa451820019b3a701?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"4a5758c3518ca814c5fc2bd7ffc309bc","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn65@2020_4/2021/04/14/18-15-27-771_bf68234dfbdd8f9b.webp","destWidth":1778,"destHeight":1333,"sourceBytes":42056,"destBytes":42056,"author":"egraffeo@businessinsider.com (Emily Graffeo)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/607703da74da0300181e19a1?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn93@2020_1/2021/04/14/18-15-32-058_33c1c654a942b363.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn1@2020_2/2021/04/14/18-15-35-145_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=KaqcHqJ9YRQ:Rb0k-zHcp98:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn37@2020_4/2021/04/14/18-15-30-534_6df901f0f6ade6c3.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=KaqcHqJ9YRQ:Rb0k-zHcp98:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn7@2020_5/2021/04/14/18-15-28-780_5951fc37f5b3c05e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn29@2020_4/2021/04/14/18-15-29-996_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=KaqcHqJ9YRQ:Rb0k-zHcp98:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn55@2020_6/2021/04/14/18-15-28-777_dfef790fcb1a6e1f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/KaqcHqJ9YRQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn82@2020_1/2021/04/14/18-15-30-739_92e056773b170024.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618424108850},{"createdTime":"2021-04-15 02:15:08","updatedTime":"2021-04-15 02:15:08","title":"Remnants of an ancient planet buried inside the Earth may be the cause of a weak spot in the magnetic field","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/magnetic-field-weak-spot-linked-pieces-planet-inside-earth-2021-4","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5e0258a3855cc25acf6c9fa2?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Magnetosphere earth magnetic field\" height=\"720\" width=\"1280\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>An artist&#39;s depiction of Earth&#39;s magnetic field, which protects the planet from solar radiation.\n<p class=\"copyright\"><a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/heliophysics/focus-areas/magnetosphere-ionosphere\" target=\"_blank\">NASA</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>Earth&#39;s magnetic field, which protects it from solar radiation, has a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/earth-magnetic-field-weakening-satellite-problems-2020-5\">weak spot</a> that&#39;s expanding.</li>\n<li>This weak spot may be caused by pieces of <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/pieces-planet-theia-buried-in-earth-mantle-2021-4\">an ancient planet that hit Earth and sank into the mantle</a>.</li>\n<li>The growing <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/why-earths-magnetic-north-is-moving-2019-4\" data-analytics-module=\"summary_bullets\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"0\">&#34;dent&#34;

But the South Atlantic Anomaly, as it&#39;s appropriately named, does affect satellites and other spacecraft that pass through an area between South America and southern Africa. That&#39;s because higher quantities of charged solar particles seep through the field there, which can cause malfunctions in computers and circuitry.</p><p>The source of this growing &#34;dent,&#34; as <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/nasa-researchers-track-slowly-splitting-dent-in-earth-s-magnetic-field\">NASA calls it</a>, is a bit of a mystery. But scientists expect it to keep expanding.</p><p>&#34;This thing is set to increase in size in the future,&#34; Julien Aubert, a geomagnetism expert from the Paris Institute of Earth Physics, told Insider.</p><p>Aubert thinks that the dent may have a connection to two gigantic blobs of dense rock buried 1,800 miles inside the Earth. Because of their makeup, the blobs disturb the liquid metal in the outer core that generates the magnetic field.</p><p>Both blobs are &#34;millions of times larger than Mount Everest in terms of volume,&#34; <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/pieces-planet-theia-buried-in-earth-mantle-2021-4\">according to Qian Yuan</a>, a researcher studying geodynamics at Arizona State University.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2021/pdf/1980.pdf\">Yuan&#39;s team</a> thinks the blobs are otherworldly in origin: After an ancient, Mars-sized planet careened into Earth, it might have left these pieces behind.</p><h2>Chunks of a 4.5 billion-old-year planet inside Earth</h2><p>Nearly 2,000 miles below Earth&#39;s surface, swirling <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2019/02/magnetic-north-update-navigation-maps/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">iron in the planet&#39;s outer core</a> generates a magnetic field that stretches all the way from there to the space surrounding our planet. </p><p>That swirl is generated, in part, by a process in which hotter, lighter material from the core rises into the semi-solid mantle above. There, it swaps places with cooler, denser mantle material, which sinks into the core below. This is known as convection. </p><p>The problem is that something at the boundary between the core and mantle underneath southern Africa is wreaking havoc on that convection, thereby weakening the strength of the magnetic field above it.</p><p>It&#39;s plausible, Aubert said, that one of the blobs Yuan&#39;s team is investigating is to blame.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/6062419ac9d73b00186e90c1?format=jpeg\" alt=\"theia\" height=\"2400\" width=\"3000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>An artist&#39;s depiction of a possible collision between a proto-planet like Theia and the Earth.\n<p class=\"copyright\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theia_%28planet%29#/media/File:Artist%27s_concept_of_collision_at_HD_172555.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">NASA/JPL-Caltech/Wikimedia Commons</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Yuan&#39;s research posits that the blobs are remnants of an ancient planet called Theia, which struck Earth in its infancy 4.5 billion years ago.

That, in turn, may lead the iron in the core under southern Africa to swirl in the opposite direction from iron in other parts of the core.</p><p>The orientation of Earth&#39;s magnetic field depends on the direction the iron inside is moving. To have a strong magnetic field, the entire thing has to be oriented the same way. So any areas that deviate from the usual pattern weaken the field&#39;s overall integrity. </p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f3d9051cdf25a001e84e4ed?format=jpeg\" alt=\"magnetic field\" height=\"320\" width=\"1038\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>A visualization of the Earth&#39;s magnetic field.\n<p class=\"copyright\">NASA Goddard Space Flight Center</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Still, it&#39;s possible these low-shear-velocity provinces aren&#39;t to blame for the field&#39;s weak spot at all.</p><p>&#34;Why doesn&#39;t the same weakness occur in the magnetic field above the Pacific, where the other province is?&#34; Christopher Finlay, a geophysicist at the Technical University of Denmark, told Insider. </p><h2>A &#39;hostile region&#39;</h2><p>A weaker field enables more charged particles from solar wind to reach satellites and other spacecraft in low-Earth orbit. That can cause problems with electronic systems, interrupt data collection, and lead expensive computer components to age prematurely.</p><p>In the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, satellite failures were frequent in the South Atlantic Anomaly, Aubert said.</p><p>Even today, the <a href=\"https://www.esa.int/Applications/Observing_the_Earth/Swarm/Swarm_probes_weakening_of_Earth_s_magnetic_field\">European Space Agency has found</a> that satellites flying through the region are &#34;more likely to experience technical malfunctions,&#34; like brief glitches that can disrupt communications.

The typical annual wage for all occupations in this industry is lower than the median for all occupations regardless of industry. The median annual wage in the amusement parks and arcades industry was $27,300, far below the median across all industries of $41,950.</p><p>For our analysis, we looked at the occupations with at least 1,000 employees in the amusement parks and arcades industry in May 2020. We then ranked this set of occupations from the lowest to highest median annual wage. We excluded sales representatives of services because although they had at least 1,000 employees, no median annual salary estimate was available for May 2020.&#160;</p><p>In addition to the annual salaries, the above slides also include the number of people employed in each occupation in this industry.</p>\n</div><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a
