She was a midwife whose husband disappeared. There wasn’t a doctor for the area, so Julius’s medical skills were welcomed in the farming village, which was comprised of a few dirt roads, a bar, and a church. There wasn’t much beyond these basic amenities.</p> \n<p>Julius was the only medical expert to care for Nagyrév’s ailing residents. The women in the village came to her for health issues and eventually with more personal concerns, like the domestic abuse they were receiving from their husbands. Her deadly advice created a group of widows called the “Angel Makers” of Hungary.</p> \n<p class=\"btcaption\" style=\"text-align: center\"><strong> Arranged marriages were the norm in early 20th-century Hungary.
