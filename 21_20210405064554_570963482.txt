The upcoming sequel, <em><strong>Space Jam: A New Legacy</strong></em>, was seemingly birthed out of a collective nostalgia for that original movie, and the desire to give current NBA legend <strong>LeBron James</strong> a starring role to match his on-court hero. Are you ready for some Tunes versus Goons action? Because the first trailer has arrived, and you can watch it below.<span id=\"more-664519\"></span></p>\n<h2>Space Jam 2 Trailer</h2>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/olXYZOsXw_o?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>Ladies and gentlemen, they&#8217;ve finally done it: they&#8217;ve made a sequel to <em>Space Jam</em>. Will the nostalgia for 1990s be satiated by the time the end credits roll? Probably not! And here&#8217;s a horrifying thought: what if an entire generation grows up with nostalgia for <em>Space Jam: A New Legacy</em>, a movie in which LeBron and his son find themselves <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/space-jam-a-new-legacy-first-look/\">trapped in the Warner 3000 entertainment &#8220;Server-verse?&#8221;</a> Granted, that likely won&#8217;t happen – or at least, not at the same scale as the first film, since entertainment options have become exponentially fractured since 1996.</p>\n<p>Try as it may, this film has an uphill climb ahead if it wants to capture the same level of attention as the original Space Jam. But who knows: maybe the idea of <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/lola-bunny-is-an-amazon/\">Lola Bunny hanging out with Amazons from DC&#8217;s <em>Wonder Woman</em> movies</a> will make enough people curious that this becomes its own big deal, even with its simultaneous HBO Max release. But hey, at least <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/space-jam-lebron-james-activism/\">some good</a> might emerge from all of all this chaos when LeBron screens the movie for the struggling kids at his I Promise School in Akron, Ohio.</p>\n<p><strong>Malcolm D.Lee</strong> directs <em>Space Jam: A New Legacy</em>, and you can read the official synopsis below:</p>\n<blockquote><p>When LeBron James and his young son Dom are trapped in a digital space by a rogue A.I., LeBron must get them home safe by leading Bugs, Lola Bunny and the whole gang of notoriously undisciplined Looney Tunes to victory over the A.I.’s digitized champions on the court: a powered-up roster of professional basketball stars as you’ve never seen them before. It&#8217;s Tunes versus Goons in the highest-stakes challenge of his life, that will redefine LeBron’s bond with his son and shine a light on the power of being yourself. The ready-for-action Tunes destroy convention, supercharge their unique talents and surprise even &#8216;King&#8217; James by playing the game their own way.</p></blockquote>\n<p><em>Space Jam: A New Legacy</em> will arrive on HBO Max and in theaters on <strong>July 16</strong>, <strong>2021</strong>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/space-jam-2-trailer/\">&#8216;Space Jam: A New Legacy&#8217; Trailer: The Looney Tunes Are Back in Action, and LeBron James is Along for the Ride</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=AS8lttA4z8c:9Zjg22w6D4Y:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=AS8lttA4z8c:9Zjg22w6D4Y:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=AS8lttA4z8c:9Zjg22w6D4Y:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=AS8lttA4z8c:9Zjg22w6D4Y:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=AS8lttA4z8c:9Zjg22w6D4Y:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=AS8lttA4z8c:9Zjg22w6D4Y:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/AS8lttA4z8c\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 03 Apr 2021 13:05:08 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/spacejam2-firstlook-photo1-frontpage-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"ab4e4ec9f2e42715697309c0e6e3bda1","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn9@2020_4/2021/04/05/06-45-29-242_d8641781dc68ee21.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":39752,"destBytes":26548,"author":"Ben Pearson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/spacejam2-firstlook-photo1-frontpage-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn9@2020_4/2021/04/05/06-45-29-242_d8641781dc68ee21.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn40@2020_4/2021/04/05/06-45-53-287_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=AS8lttA4z8c:9Zjg22w6D4Y:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn45@2020_5/2021/04/05/06-45-53-436_8b628b86f767cdc8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn56@2020_4/2021/04/05/06-45-53-291_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=AS8lttA4z8c:9Zjg22w6D4Y:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn24@2020_6/2021/04/05/06-45-53-430_53f0b8725d33701a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/AS8lttA4z8c":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn35@2020_2/2021/04/05/06-45-53-292_949adaae4d5a47c7.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617605099448},{"createdTime":"2021-04-05 14:44:59","updatedTime":"2021-04-05 14:44:59","title":"This Week In Trailers: Percy Vs Goliath, American Oz, A.rtificial I.mmortality, Together Together, Moby Doc","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=664844","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-576905 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Fewer-trailers-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"This Week in Trailers\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Fewer-trailers-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Fewer-trailers-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Fewer-trailers-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Fewer-trailers.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><em>Trailers are an under-appreciated art form insofar that many times they’re seen as vehicles for showing footage, explaining films away, or showing their hand about what moviegoers can expect.

Featuring interviews with David Lynch and David Bowie, along with extraordinary concert footage, utilizing a unique blend of re-enactments, interviews, and archival footage, audiences will be treated to an insightful, unvarnished look at an artist who has sold more than 20 million albums, an activist who has long championed animal rights, and a man whose traumatic childhood shaped him in profound ways. This introspective journey sets out to answer existential questions of purpose and meaning by examining a life of extreme highs and lows, joy, tragedy, success and failure.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It&#8217;s perfectly okay to look askance at a documentary where the subject themselves is narrating it. But the trailer gives us a lot of narrative dirt to not let that be an issue with all the warts on display. This is a near-perfect blend of the accolades the musician has received from talking heads like David Lynch while being bluntly honest about who the man before us once was. We&#8217;re not shying away from his past or the wretched things he did in the days he indulged in the kind of hedonism most of us will never understand. Still, he has an incredible story to tell, can claim one of the best musical outros from action movie history with the <em>Bourne</em> franchise (&#8220;Extreme Ways&#8221;), and seems someone I&#8217;d at least like to understand a little better.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Uign_rXp7dA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<h2><strong>Together Together</strong></h2>\n<p>Director <strong>Nikole Beckwith</strong> has made something that looks easy and breezy.</p>\n<blockquote><p>When a young loner becomes the gestational surrogate for a single man in his 40s, the two strangers come to realize this unexpected relationship will challenge their perceptions of connection, boundaries and the particulars of love.</p></blockquote>\n<p>A few seconds into this trailer, I was already about to bail. The saccharine levels of the twee-ness on display was almost too much. And then there it was. The Sundance 2021 logo. Normally that would convince me to keep watching on its own merits, but in this case, I just needed to understand how it got this honor. The directing seems capable enough, but the music is borderline grating, and the premise doesn&#8217;t feel that special. I see glimmers of truth here with <strong>Ed Helms</strong> talking about the loneliness of being single so late in life, but then we see how &#8220;inept&#8221; he is at putting together things or having a stuffed bunny fall on the floor from his papoose. The tense relationship with his surrogate feels really contrived too. I&#8217;m hoping for a curveball to explain how this got into Sundance, but this just looks like a slow pitch in the worst way.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/bCn5OWnzl04?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<h2>A.rtificial I.mmortality</h2>\n<p>Director <strong>Ann Shin</strong> delves deep into AI.</p>\n<blockquote><p>If you could create an immortal version of yourself, would you? Once the stuff of science fiction, A.I. experts now see it as possible. This feature documentary explores the latest thinking and technological advancements in AI.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Thinking about where technology is headed excites me. /Film&#8217;s own <strong>Devindra Hardawar</strong> makes appearances on <em><strong><a href=\"https://twit.tv/shows/this-week-in-tech\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">This Week In Tech</a></strong></em> where things like this are discussed and dissected. It&#8217;s thrilling to see where tech is going and this trailer asks daring questions. It does, however, linger a little too long on actual robots. Actually, it lingers <em>way</em> too long on robots and how their ascension plays into all this. But it&#8217;s the work being done to further our understanding of artificial intelligence that&#8217;s most engaging. It&#8217;s also a little provocative with its tense score and doomsday imagery that&#8217;s peppered here and there, no doubt to elicit a reaction. However, it still looks like it would be worth my time to check out.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7kDH6DR8dAg?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<h2>American Oz</h2>\n<p>Directors <strong>Randall MacLowry </strong>and<strong> Tracy Heather Strain</strong> examine a writer who has never been forgotten.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Explore the life and times of author L. Frank Baum, the creator of one of the most beloved, enduring and classic American narratives. By 1900, when The Wonderful Wizard of Oz was published, Baum was 44 years old and had spent much of his life in restless pursuit of success. With mixed results he dove into a string of jobs — chicken breeder, actor, marketer of petroleum products, shopkeeper, newspaperman and traveling salesman — Baum continued to reinvent himself, reflecting a uniquely American brand of confidence, imagination and innovation. During his travels to the Great Plains and on to Chicago during the American frontier’s final days, he witnessed a nation coming to terms with the economic uncertainty of the Gilded Age. But he never lost his childlike sense of wonder and eventually crafted his observations into a magical tale of survival, adventure and self-discovery, reinterpreted through the generations in films, books and musicals.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I am already a fan of MacLowry and Strain as they both come from strong PBS backgrounds. The work they do isn&#8217;t to showcase or promote their own &#8220;signature&#8221; style of direction, but they&#8217;re just here to deliver a story that is well-told, well-constructed, and hews closely to the likes of Nova, Frontline, and more. I could be wrong, but the trailer certainly doesn&#8217;t do much to refute that. There are no great directorial flourishes. In fact, it&#8217;s almost intentionally devoid of them. Instead, they let the subject speak fo itself by showing his effects on others and how his work has transcended the page. Solid work.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/HF0WIiiZY-c?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<h2>Percy Vs Goliath</h2>\n<p>Director <strong>Clark Johnson</strong> is working with some solid talent.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Academy Award Winner Christopher Walken, Zach Braff and Christina Ricci star in the true story of a small-town farmer taking on one of the largest agricultural and food manufacturing corporations. Percy Schmeiser (Walken), a third-generation farmer, is sued by a corporate giant for allegedly using their patented seeds. With little resources to fight the giant legal battle, Percy joins forces with up-and-coming attorney Jackson Weaver (Braff) and environmental activist Rebecca Salcau (Ricci) to fight one of the most monumental cases all the way up to the Supreme Court.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In an age where facts seem to be as important as your horoscope, it&#8217;s nice to see an almost genteel &#8220;Based on True Facts&#8221; flick that not only looks okay but seems pretty well acted too. The trailer doesn&#8217;t seem like it wants to challenge anything about the way you&#8217;ve seen this kind of story. In fact, it almost looks like it&#8217;s taking a page out of Hallmark&#8217;s directorial playbook. That said, even inoffensive movies like this still have a place in my heart when you&#8217;ve got someone like<strong> Christopher Walken</strong> doing what he does best. I&#8217;m sure this will be here and gone once it drops, but you could do worse if you&#8217;re looking for something to watch.</p>\n<p><em style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">Nota bene: If you have any suggestions of trailers for possible inclusion in this column, even have a trailer of your own to pitch, please let me know by sending me a note at Christopher_Stipp@yahoo.com or look me up via Twitter at @Stipp</em></p>\n<div>\n<p>In case you missed them, here are the other trailers we covered at /Film this week:</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-mitchells-vs-the-machines-trailer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>The Mitchells vs. The Machines Trailer</strong></a> &#8211;

So we have some catching up to do with <strong>Scarlett Johansson</strong> as the assassin-turned-Avenger known as Black Widow in her own movie.</p>\n<p>In a new <em>Black Widow</em> trailer, it&#8217;s clear Marvel is going back to the beginning of Nathasha Romanoff&#8217;s life by introducing us to her family. Well, it&#8217;s not her real family, but it&#8217;s all she&#8217;s got, including an adoptive sister named Yelena (<strong>Florence Pugh</strong>) and two trained assassins (<strong>David Harbour</strong> and <strong>Rachel Weisz</strong>) as their makeshift parents.

It looks like there&#8217;s some bitter blood between them, with Natasha seemingly resenting them for turning her into a killer. But it seems her sister Yelena still feels a bond with her provisional sibling.</p>\n<p>Since this is a Marvel movie, there&#8217;s also a lot more action to be seen. Taskmaster looks like quite a formidable opponent, blasting an explosive arrow (a move borrowed from Hawkeye) in the middle of a car chase, and showing impressive acrobatics while wielding a shield (maybe a trick he got from Spider-Man). New footage also shows off more of the epic, free-falling fight in the sky, which looks like a sequence unlike any other we&#8217;ve seen in Marvel movies.</p>\n<p>Hopefully enough of the COVID-19 vaccine will have been spread around the country for people to return to movie theaters this summer and dig back into the Marvel Cinematic Universe.</p>\n<blockquote><p>In Marvel Studios’ action-packed spy thriller “Black Widow,” Natasha Romanoff aka Black Widow confronts the darker parts of her ledger when a dangerous conspiracy with ties to her past arises. Pursued by a force that will stop at nothing to bring her down, Natasha must deal with her history as a spy and the broken relationships left in her wake long before she became an Avenger.</p></blockquote>\n<p>After being delayed from release last year early on during the coronavirus pandemic, Marvel’s <em>Black Wido</em>w is finally slated to hit theaters on Disney+ Premier Access on <strong><span class=\"style-scope yt-formatted-string\" dir=\"auto\"> July 9</span>, 2021</strong>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/new-black-widow-trailer/\">Marvel&#8217;s &#8216;Black Widow&#8217; Trailer: Natasha Romanoff&#8217;s Family Secrets Are About to Be Revealed</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=t2iukSYRcHw:u_CNZht204w:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=t2iukSYRcHw:u_CNZht204w:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=t2iukSYRcHw:u_CNZht204w:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=t2iukSYRcHw:u_CNZht204w:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=t2iukSYRcHw:u_CNZht204w:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=t2iukSYRcHw:u_CNZht204w:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/t2iukSYRcHw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 03 Apr 2021 16:25:33 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/blackwidow-natasha-yelena-debris-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"ea9646c9a0e94c323091c0497f830be4","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn5@2020_2/2021/04/05/06-45-51-754_424a5e024c37c08d.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":34387,"destBytes":23188,"author":"Ethan Anderton","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/blackwidow-natasha-yelena-debris-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn5@2020_2/2021/04/05/06-45-51-754_424a5e024c37c08d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn40@2020_4/2021/04/05/06-45-53-287_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=t2iukSYRcHw:u_CNZht204w:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn27@2020_1/2021/04/05/06-45-53-565_dd545227f1c1b253.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn56@2020_4/2021/04/05/06-45-53-291_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=t2iukSYRcHw:u_CNZht204w:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn41@2020_1/2021/04/05/06-45-53-394_9010bfa2f90fe5ed.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/t2iukSYRcHw":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn49@2020_1/2021/04/05/06-45-53-278_e3e7752c00075376.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617605099460},{"createdTime":"2021-04-05 14:44:59","updatedTime":"2021-04-05 14:44:59","title":"‘The Right Stuff’ Canceled at Disney+, But the Series May Find a New Home","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=665305","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-665307 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/therightstuff-astronauts-pressconference-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"The Right Stuff Canceled\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/therightstuff-astronauts-pressconference.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/therightstuff-astronauts-pressconference-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><strong><em>The Right Stuff</em></strong> was the second original series to debut on Disney+ after <em>The Mandalorian</em>. Unfortunately, the series about the early days of the United States space program and the first team of astronauts known as the Mercury 7 appears to have run its course, because Disney+ has canceled the series after just one season. However, there&#8217;s still hope for the series to continue because Warner Bros. Television is shopping the project to other outlets. <span id=\"more-665305\"></span></p>\n<p>Loosely based on the 1979 <a title=\"The Right Stuff (book)\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Right_Stuff_(book)\">book of the same name</a> by Tom Wolfe and the 1983 film adaptation that follows, <em>The Right Stuff</em> was the first original series produced by National Geographic for the streaming service. Here&#8217;s the trailer and the official synopsis:</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Og0htvEVqJQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>At the center of <em>The Right Stuff </em>was Major John Glenn (<strong>Patrick J. Adams</strong>), a revered Marine test pilot and committed family man, and Lieutenant Commander Alan Shepard (<strong>Jake McDorman</strong>), one of the best test pilots in Navy history. The series also focused on Mercury 7 crew members like Captain Gordo Cooper (<strong>Colin O’Donoghue</strong>), the youngest of the seven selected; Wally Schirra (<strong>Aaron Staton</strong>), a competitive pilot with a gift for pulling pranks; Scott Carpenter (<strong>James Lafferty</strong>), dubbed “The Poet” by his fellow astronauts; Deke Slayto (<strong>Micah Stock</strong>), a quiet but incredibly intelligent pilot and engineer; and Gus Grissom, (<strong>Michael Trotter</strong>), a decorated military veteran who eventually becomes the second man in space.</p>\n<p>As the history books tell us, there&#8217;s still plenty of story to tell about the developing space program, but Disney+ has opted not to renew the series for a second season. That&#8217;s a reversal from Disney+&#8217;s original plans in November last year, which would have given the series $13.7 million to move production from Florida to California for a second season. But despite getting the offered the fourth-highest relocating incentive ever awarded under the California Film Commission program, the second season isn&#8217;t happening at Disney+.</p>\n<p>Now Warner Bros. Television is looking at potential new homes like TNT and HBO Max. The studio recently sought an extension of the options on the cast to return for a second season so they can figure out if the series can continue elsewhere. What&#8217;s not clear is what the direction of the series would take. Apparently negotiations with Disney+ included a potential new direction for the show with a focus on a space mission from the 1980s with a completely new cast, making <em>The Right Stuff</em> into an anthology series of sorts. It&#8217;s not clear if that would be the plan at a new streaming home.</p>\n<p>Though<em> The Right Stuff</em> received solid reviews, the show never broke into Nielsen’s Top 10 streaming ratings. Since this is show business we&#8217;re talking about, if the audience isn&#8217;t tuning in enough to make the series worth producing, then cuts have to be made. Is there enough of an audience for it to be more lucrative for another streaming service? That remains to be seen.</p>\n<p><em>The Right Stuff</em> is executive produced by <strong>Mark Lafferty</strong> (<em>Halt and Catch Fire</em>, <em>Castle Rock</em>), who also acts as showrunner. <strong>Jennifer Davisson</strong> and <strong>Leonardo DiCaprio</strong> also executive produce through their Appian Way production banner along with <strong>Will Staples</strong> (<em>Animals</em>), <strong>Danny Strong</strong> (<em>Empire</em>), <strong>Howard Korder</strong> (<em>Boardwalk Empire</em>), and <strong>Chris Long</strong> (<em>The Americans</em>), who also directs the first episode. Martins Scorsese’s longtime editor <strong>Thelma Schoonmaker</strong> also acts as a consulting producer, and <strong>Michael Hampton</strong> oversaw production for Appian Way as a co-producer.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-right-stuff-canceled-at-disney-plus/\">&#8216;The Right Stuff&#8217; Canceled at Disney+, But the Series May Find a New Home</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=SZB2I3M8fm4:pueaQJo-Q6M:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=SZB2I3M8fm4:pueaQJo-Q6M:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=SZB2I3M8fm4:pueaQJo-Q6M:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=SZB2I3M8fm4:pueaQJo-Q6M:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=SZB2I3M8fm4:pueaQJo-Q6M:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=SZB2I3M8fm4:pueaQJo-Q6M:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/SZB2I3M8fm4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 04 Apr 2021 18:00:57 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/therightstuff-astronauts-pressconference-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"d44350de9b08e1dae8ccd9018676c288","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn20@2020_6/2021/04/05/06-45-06-991_26b71cf8bdf57d63.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":43380,"destBytes":29308,"author":"Ethan Anderton","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/therightstuff-astronauts-pressconference-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn20@2020_6/2021/04/05/06-45-06-991_26b71cf8bdf57d63.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn40@2020_4/2021/04/05/06-45-53-287_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=SZB2I3M8fm4:pueaQJo-Q6M:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn54@2020_5/2021/04/05/06-45-53-465_ab2ebc4c50763d9c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn56@2020_4/2021/04/05/06-45-53-291_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=SZB2I3M8fm4:pueaQJo-Q6M:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn87@2020_2/2021/04/05/06-45-53-926_5892a8619d1971a4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/SZB2I3M8fm4":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn34@2020_6/2021/04/05/06-45-53-293_c569fbfbeb1f33a8.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617605099448},{"createdTime":"2021-04-05 14:44:59","updatedTime":"2021-04-05 14:44:59","title":"‘Space Jam: A New Legacy’ Makes Zendaya the Voice of Lola Bunny","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=665299","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-665301 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/spacejam-newlegacy-lolabunny-oncourt-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"Space Jam: A New Legacy - New Lola Bunny Voice\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/spacejam-newlegacy-lolabunny-oncourt.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/spacejam-newlegacy-lolabunny-oncourt-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Marvel&#8217;s <em>Spider-Man</em> franchise co-star <strong>Zendaya</strong> has already found fame in animation <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/9/25/17901216/zendaya-is-meechee-smallfoot-meme-gabriel-gundacker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">as the voice of Meechee</a> in the chilly family film <em>Smallfoot</em>.

Lee wanted to make Lola Bunny a more &#8220;fully-realized&#8221; character this time. In the first movie, she&#8217;s played up as a cartoon sex symbol and romantic foil for Bugs Bunny. She&#8217;s also drawn rather provocatively for a movie geared towards kids. She&#8217;s not quite as sexualized as Jessica Rabbit, but she certainly doesn&#8217;t need short shorts and a crop top. Lee <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/lola-bunny-is-an-amazon/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">previously said</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;This is 2021. It’s important to reflect the authenticity of strong, capable female characters. She probably has the most human characteristics of the Tunes; she doesn’t have a thing like a carrot or a lisp or a stutter. So we reworked a lot of things, not only her look, like making sure she had an appropriate length on her shorts and was feminine without being objectified, but gave her a real voice. For us, it was, let’s ground her athletic prowess, her leadership skills, and make her as full a character as the others.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Having Zendaya voice Lola Bunny will also give her a different vibe. In the original <em>Space Jam</em>, she was voiced rather <strong>Kath Soucie</strong>, who has lent her voice to characters like Phil and Lil in the <em>Rugrats</em> TV series and movies and Kanga in a variety of <em>Winnie the Pooh</em> projects. Zendaya&#8217;s comic book movie experience should help her too, because we&#8217;ll catch up with Lola Bunny <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/lola-bunny-is-an-amazon/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">hanging out with the Amazons</a> from Wonder Woman.</p>\n<p><strong>Malcolm D.Lee</strong> directs <em>Space Jam: A New Legacy</em>, and you can read the official synopsis below:</p>\n<blockquote><p>When LeBron James and his young son Dom are trapped in a digital space by a rogue A.I., LeBron must get them home safe by leading Bugs, Lola Bunny and the whole gang of notoriously undisciplined Looney Tunes to victory over the A.I.’s digitized champions on the court: a powered-up roster of professional basketball stars as you’ve never seen them before. It’s Tunes versus Goons in the highest-stakes challenge of his life, that will redefine LeBron’s bond with his son and shine a light on the power of being yourself. The ready-for-action Tunes destroy convention, supercharge their unique talents and surprise even ‘King’ James by playing the game their own way.</p></blockquote>\n<p><em>Space Jam: A New Legacy</em> will arrive on HBO Max and in theaters on <strong>July 16</strong>, <strong>2021</strong>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/zendaya-is-the-new-lola-bunny-voice-in-space-jam-a-new-legacy/\">&#8216;Space Jam: A New Legacy&#8217; Makes Zendaya the Voice of Lola Bunny</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=DQPDxCgFxdM:11kuEGlo68w:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=DQPDxCgFxdM:11kuEGlo68w:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=DQPDxCgFxdM:11kuEGlo68w:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=DQPDxCgFxdM:11kuEGlo68w:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=DQPDxCgFxdM:11kuEGlo68w:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=DQPDxCgFxdM:11kuEGlo68w:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/DQPDxCgFxdM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 04 Apr 2021 17:00:58 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/spacejam-newlegacy-lolabunny-oncourt-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"da7b472858b785b586291c614688d37c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn3@2020_1/2021/04/05/06-45-12-489_110409aef7ac109d.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":32071,"destBytes":21322,"author":"Ethan Anderton","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/spacejam-newlegacy-lolabunny-oncourt-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn3@2020_1/2021/04/05/06-45-12-489_110409aef7ac109d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn40@2020_4/2021/04/05/06-45-53-287_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=DQPDxCgFxdM:11kuEGlo68w:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn44@2020_4/2021/04/05/06-45-53-359_3e68bda666d2e78a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn56@2020_4/2021/04/05/06-45-53-291_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=DQPDxCgFxdM:11kuEGlo68w:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn51@2020_6/2021/04/05/06-45-53-371_2d1ef70864e5b80c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/DQPDxCgFxdM":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn37@2020_1/2021/04/05/06-45-53-243_580763578cfbc142.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617605099460}],"record":{"createdTime":"2021-04-05 14:44:59","updatedTime":"2021-04-05 14:44:59","feedId":21,"fetchDate":"Mon, 05 Apr 2021 06:44:59 +0000","fetchMs":68,"handleMs":1498,"totalMs":56528,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":20,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"922192e12375f6c0383ac3b2dc05158d","hostName":"us-003*","requestId":"a76caca5efb74722b1ab452d1eb8cee8_21","contentType":"text/xml; charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":128212,"bgimgsTotal":5,"bgimgsGithubTotal":5,"articlesImgsTotal":22,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":22,"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx25":1,"myreaderx15":1,"myreaderx7":1,"myreaderx16":1,"myreaderx6":1,"myreaderx27":1,"myreaderx4":1,"myreaderx10":1,"myreaderx32":1,"myreaderx21":1,"myreaderx11":1,"myreaderx12":1,"myreaderx2":1,"myreaderx13":1,"myreaderx1":1,"myreaderx30":1,"myreaderx31":1,"myreaderx5oss":1,"myreaderx29":1,"myreaderx18":1,"myreaderx19":1,"myreaderx":1},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-05-30 17:21:38","updatedTime":"2020-09-01 09:23:23","id":21,"name":"/Film","url":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/slashfilm","subscriber":null,"website":null,"icon":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/cropped-ZZ46A5EC75-32x32.jpg","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx64/cdn36@2020_2/2020/09/01/01-23-09-121_cba84478f5ca776d.jpg","description":"Movie News and Reviews This feed is for non commercial use.
