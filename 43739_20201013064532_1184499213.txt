How did infographic icons come to exist?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The story starts with the man you see on every public bathroom door along with the woman. He has a way of showing up in airports and on highways. But never for long. If he is the world&#8217;s most recognizable icon, why don&#8217;t we see more of him? This is about to change.</span></p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-24607\" src=\"https://blog.adioma.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/human-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"29\" height=\"64\" /></p>\n<h2>The Most Recognizable Icon</h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This man turns out to be one of the most common and recognizable icons in the world. First designed by AIGA and adopted by National Park Service, it made its way into many interfaces and more recently into infographics. It turns out, this kind of icon is the easiest to modify without losing all meaning.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">   </span></span></p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-24608 size-medium\" src=\"https://blog.adioma.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-07-26-at-11.32.37-PM-300x88.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"88\" srcset=\"https://blog.adioma.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-07-26-at-11.32.37-PM-300x88.png 300w, https://blog.adioma.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-07-26-at-11.32.37-PM.png 688w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Same man, different lives.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">It also turns out that this kind of icon is enough to tell powerful stories. Like this one. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This infographic reached more than 1 million people and counting.</span></p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-24609\" src=\"https://blog.adioma.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-07-26-at-11.36.52-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1364\" height=\"434\" srcset=\"https://blog.adioma.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-07-26-at-11.36.52-PM.png 1364w, https://blog.adioma.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-07-26-at-11.36.52-PM-300x95.png 300w, https://blog.adioma.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-07-26-at-11.36.52-PM-768x244.png 768w, https://blog.adioma.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-07-26-at-11.36.52-PM-1024x326.png 1024w, https://blog.adioma.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-07-26-at-11.36.52-PM-700x223.png 700w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1364px) 100vw, 1364px\" /></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><a href=\"https://blog.adioma.com/timeline-infographic-of-founder-age/\"><span class=\"s2\">(Full infographic)</span></a></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">And this is only five icons. No illustration. There is also no magic. Icons, in my opinion, give you that most direct way of telling a story without distracting with the details.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I did not invent this idea. Otto Neurath did. Except he borrowed it from the Egyptians. So this trick is at least 3,000 years old.</span></p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-24610\" src=\"https://blog.adioma.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/isotype-weaving.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"652\" height=\"649\" srcset=\"https://blog.adioma.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/isotype-weaving.jpg 652w, https://blog.adioma.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/isotype-weaving-150x150.jpg 150w, https://blog.adioma.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/isotype-weaving-300x300.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 652px) 100vw, 652px\" /></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">So, today we are releasing a searchable set of infographic icons that use this man as the single style guide.

You can even combine any two of the visual elements to search by. Even three. For example, let&#8217;s say you are working on a presentation about crowdfunding. You know you want an icon that should people and money in it. You can select the person icon and the dollar sign icon to see all the icons that have people and money in them.</p>\n<h2><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-24617\" src=\"https://blog.adioma.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/adioma-visual-search.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"1406\" height=\"744\" srcset=\"https://blog.adioma.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/adioma-visual-search.gif 1406w, https://blog.adioma.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/adioma-visual-search-300x159.gif 300w, https://blog.adioma.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/adioma-visual-search-768x406.gif 768w, https://blog.adioma.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/adioma-visual-search-1024x542.gif 1024w, https://blog.adioma.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/adioma-visual-search-700x370.gif 700w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1406px) 100vw, 1406px\" /></h2>\n<h2>Why Infographic Icons</h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When I started making infographics, I spent a lot of my time searching for icons that could tell a story. I noticed that most icons were made for interfaces and were not expressive enough to use an in an infographic. This is how this collection started. And now you can use it for free.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">How to Use Infographic Icons</span></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If you are working inside PowerPoint or Illustrator, you can download the PNG or the SVG and one the file and then paste the icon into your document. This would also work for PowerPoint. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If you want to then use some of the icons in your article, you can paste them directly into your editor as a Base 64, which is just a link that you paste.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">You can color and re-size the icons for free.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If you want to save time from having to download and upload the icon, head over to <a href=\"https://adioma.com\"><span class=\"s2\">adioma.com</span></a> to get your free trial. You can insert any icon directly into your document in Adioma.</span></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://blog.adioma.com/infographic-icons-use/\">Infographic Icons &#8211; Why and How
