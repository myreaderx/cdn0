In this round, Republican lawmakers called the hearing to press the tech titans on &#8220;Censorship, Suppression, and the 2020 Election.&#8221; The hearing, which was scheduled before the election, was apparently inspired by the platforms&#8217; decisions to limit the reach of a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/16/twitter-changes-its-hacked-materials-policy-in-wake-of-new-york-post-controversy/\">dubious New York Post story</a> presenting leaked information purporting to implicate now President-elect Joe Biden and his son Hunter in a corrupt political influence scheme in Ukraine.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"4EgzgGnGOE\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/16/twitter-new-york-post/\">Twitter is now allowing users to share that controversial New York Post story</a></p></blockquote><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Twitter is now allowing users to share that controversial New York Post story&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/16/twitter-new-york-post/embed/#?secret=4EgzgGnGOE\" data-secret=\"4EgzgGnGOE\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>If the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/01/section-230-hearing-big-tech/\">last hearing</a> is any indication, and it likely is, Tuesday&#8217;s tech vs. Congress showdown will be less about cornering the two tech platform CEOs on the stated topic than it will be a far-ranging complaint session about Republicans&#8217; ongoing complaints about anti-conservative bias punctuated by bipartisan soliloquies on lawmakers&#8217; various pet topics. While that hearing, held last month in the Senate Commerce Committee, was ostensibly about Section 230 reform, the pressing policy issue <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/28/section-230-barely-rates-a-mention-in-senates-hasty-pre-election-flogging-of-tech-ceos/\">barely came up</a>.</p>\n<p>Tuesday will be the first post-election Congressional appearance from social media leaders, so we can also expect a war of competing political realities. In one, President Trump, unfairly assailed by tech and the media alike, is somehow still a contender for the presidency. In the other reality (the real one), President-elect Joe Biden won the election decisively but his victory remains <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/04/trump-election-2020-premature-victory-facebook-twitter/\">mired in social media misinformation</a>. The latter scenario has played out in spite of a mixed bag of special tools and rules devised by Twitter and Facebook to rein in looming post-election conspiracies.</p>\n<p>The Senate Judiciary Committee is led by Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, a former Trump critic turned hype guy who has urged the president not to concede the election. Sen. Ben Sasse, a Republican who broke rank to recognize the reality of the election results, will also have a turn at Zuckerberg and Dorsey. Democrats on the committee include a generous sprinkling of contenders for the 2020 nomination, including Senators Cory Booker, Amy Klobuchar and now Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, who is doing transition work and unlikely to be present.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in subjecting yourself to Tuesday&#8217;s proceedings, you can watch the hearing live on the committee&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/meetings/breaking-the-news-censorship-suppression-and-the-2020-election\">own page</a> or on <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?478048-1/facebook-twitter-ceos-testify-senate-judiciary-committee\">C-SPAN</a> Tuesday at 7AM PT.

While its competitors often emphasize throughput, the team believes that for edge solutions, latency is the more important metric. While architectures that focus on throughput make sense in the data center, Deep Vision CTO Hameed argues that this doesn&#8217;t necessarily make them a good fit at the edge.</p>\n<p>&#8220;[Throughput architectures] require a large number of streams being processed by the accelerator at the same time to fully utilize the hardware, whether it&#8217;s through batching or pipeline execution,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;That&#8217;s the only way for them to get their big throughput. The result, of course, is high latency for individual tasks and that makes them a poor fit in our opinion for an edge use case where real-time performance is key.&#8221;</p>\n<p>To enable this performance &#8212; and Deep Vision claims that its processor offers far lower latency than Google&#8217;s Edge TPUs and Movidius&#8217; MyriadX, for example &#8212; the team is using an architecture that reduces data movement on the chip to a minimum. In addition, its software optimizes the overall data flow inside the architecture based on the specific workload.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2074434\" style=\"width: 455px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Deep-Vision-Processor-2.png\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2074434\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-2074434\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Deep-Vision-Processor-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"445\" height=\"445\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Deep-Vision-Processor-2.png 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Deep-Vision-Processor-2.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Deep-Vision-Processor-2.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Deep-Vision-Processor-2.png?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Deep-Vision-Processor-2.png?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Deep-Vision-Processor-2.png?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Deep-Vision-Processor-2.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Deep-Vision-Processor-2.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Deep-Vision-Processor-2.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Deep-Vision-Processor-2.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Deep-Vision-Processor-2.png?resize=128,128 128w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 445px) 100vw, 445px\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2074434\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Deep Vision</p></div></p>\n<p>&#8220;In our design, instead of baking in a particular acceleration strategy into the hardware, we have instead built the right programmable primitives into our own processor, which allows the software to map any type of data flow or any execution flow that you might find in a neural network graph efficiently on top of the same set of basic primitives,&#8221; said Hameed.</p>\n<p>With this, the compiler can then look at the model and figure out how to best map it on the hardware to optimize for data flow and minimize data movement. Thanks to this, the processor and compiler can also support virtually any neural network framework and optimize their models without the developers having to think about the specific hardware constraints that often make working with other chips hard.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Every aspect of our hardware/software stack has been architected with the same two high-level goals in mind,&#8221; Hameed said. &#8220;One is to minimize the data movement to drive efficiency. And then also to keep every part of the design flexible in a way where the right execution plan can be used for every type of problem.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Since its founding, the company has raised about $19 million and filed nine patents. The new chip has been sampling for a while, and even though the company already has a couple of customers, it chose to remain under the radar until now. The company obviously hopes that its unique architecture can give it an edge in this market, which is getting increasingly competitive. Besides the likes of Intel&#8217;s Movidius chips (and custom chips from Google and AWS for their own clouds), there are also plenty of startups in this space, including the likes of Hailo, which

It’s important for startups to understand the different generational approaches of their customers.

It’s a strategy any startup can use, regardless of size or budget.\t\t\t\t\t</blockquote>\n\t</div>\n\t</span></p>\n<p>Millennials and Generation Z are now the largest consumer market in the world, so you can’t ignore them if you want to scale. With Lifesum these generations have helped our brand surpass the older and well-established competitors. We achieved this by intimately understanding how they view health and fitness.</p>\n<p>Gen Z and millennials are all about empowerment. They grew up with Google and Facebook, having information at their fingertips. They are far less likely to be moved by a TV commercial since they desire to discover the world on their own.</p>\n<p>In our industry, we’ve learned millennials and Gen Z don’t want a one-size-fits-all weight loss program or to count calories like their parents did 20 years ago. As millennials and Gen Z started embracing keto, intermittent fasting and pescatarian diets, our nutrition team had already created tailored programs to help them stick with it.</p>\n<h2>Bypass traditional marketing methods</h2>\n<p>As a brand, it’s important to look ahead and anticipate what is coming next. This also applies to marketing your product. If you get in early with emerging marketing platforms, you will save money and potentially reach more early adopters.<div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=vwFZXwpmNIw:zIylqXFPhpw:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=vwFZXwpmNIw:zIylqXFPhpw:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=vwFZXwpmNIw:zIylqXFPhpw:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=vwFZXwpmNIw:zIylqXFPhpw:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=vwFZXwpmNIw:zIylqXFPhpw:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=vwFZXwpmNIw:zIylqXFPhpw:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=vwFZXwpmNIw:zIylqXFPhpw:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=vwFZXwpmNIw:zIylqXFPhpw:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/vwFZXwpmNIw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 16 Nov 2020 19:37:08 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"b2b688b82e558a0569a2633c1c484b84","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn12@2020_5/2020/11/17/05-38-40-098_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Walter Thompson","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn12@2020_5/2020/11/17/05-38-40-098_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn63@2020_3/2020/11/17/05-38-42-840_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn11@2020_6/2020/11/17/05-38-42-593_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=vwFZXwpmNIw:zIylqXFPhpw:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn4@2020_6/2020/11/17/05-38-57-639_4eb260179e3a30d9.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=vwFZXwpmNIw:zIylqXFPhpw:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn15@2020_1/2020/11/17/05-38-43-735_f7f35e8526f49d05.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn4@2020_3/2020/11/17/05-38-43-522_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/vwFZXwpmNIw":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn32@2020_3/2020/11/17/05-39-03-614_8948fcbf01637f1a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605591519886},{"createdTime":"2020-11-17 13:38:39","updatedTime":"2020-11-17 13:38:39","title":"Ride Vision raises $7M for its AI-based motorcycle safety system","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2074540","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a href=\"https://ride.vision/\">Ride Vision</a>, an Israeli startup that is building an AI-driven safety system to prevent motorcycle collisions, today announced that it has raised a $7 million Series A round led by crowdsourcing platform <a href=\"https://www.ourcrowd.com/\">OurCrowd</a>. YL Ventures, which typically specializes in cybersecurity startups but also led the company&#8217;s $2.5 million seed round in 2018, Mobilion VC and motorcycle mirror manufacturer Metagal also participated in this round.

Using computer vision, Ride Vision&#8217;s system, the Ride Vision 1, analyzes the traffic around a rider in real time. It provides forward collision alerts and monitors your blind spot, but it can also tell you when you&#8217;re following another rider or car too closely. It can also simply record your ride and, coming soon, it&#8217;ll be able to make emergency calls on your behalf when things go awry.</p>\n<p>As the company argues, the number of motorcycles (and other motorized two-wheeled vehicles) has only increased during the pandemic, as people started avoiding public transport and looked for relatively affordable alternatives. In Europe, sales of two-wheeled vehicles increased by 30% during the pandemic.</p>\n<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/8eyEA374Mbw?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>\n<p>The hardware on the motorcycle itself is pretty straightforward. It includes two wide-angle cameras (one each at the front and rear), as well as alert indicators on the mirrors, as well as the main computing unit. Ride Vision has patents on its human-machine warning interface and vision algorithms.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that there are some blind-spot monitoring solutions for motorcycles on the market already, including those from <a href=\"https://www.innovv.com/innovv-thirdeye\">Innovv</a> and <a href=\"https://meetsenzar.com/\">Senzar</a>. Honda also has <a href=\"https://jalopnik.com/honda-just-patented-blind-spot-monitoring-for-motorcycl-1768339089\">patents</a> on similar technologies. These do not provide the kind of 360-degree view that Ride Vision is aiming for.</p>\n<p>Ride Vision says its products will be available in Italy, Germany, Austria, Spain, France, Greece, Israel and the U.K. in early 2021, with the U.S., Brazil, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/canada-c0c7\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\"

href=\"https://github.blog/2020-11-16-standing-up-for-developers-youtube-dl-is-back/\">restored the code</a> of a project that the RIAA <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/23/the-riaa-is-coming-for-the-youtube-downloaders/\">demanded it take down last month</a> after finding that the group&#8217;s DMCA complaint was meritless.<a href=\"https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl\"> YouTube-dl</a>, a tool that lets videos from the streaming site be downloaded for offline viewing, is back in action — and GitHub is changing its policy and earmarking a million dollars for a legal defense fund against future importunities.</p>\n<p>The controversy began in mid-October when the RIAA sent a DMCA complaint to GitHub claiming that <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/youtube\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"youtube\">YouTube <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a>-dl violated the law not only by providing a tool for circumventing DRM, but by promoting the piracy of several popular songs in its documentation.</p>\n<p>GitHub, like many tech companies, tends to assume the veracity of a complaint like this if it&#8217;s from a known entity like the RIAA, and it seems to have done so here, taking down YouTube-dl and publishing the complaint.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\"

frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>As many pointed out at the time, saying this project is a tool for circumventing DRM is like saying a tape recorder is a tool for music piracy. It&#8217;s used for far more than that, from research and accessibility purposes to integration with other apps for watch-later features and so on.</p>\n<p>After a fork of YouTube-dl was created that lacked the references to popular YouTube videos as examples for use, the project was largely back online. But then GitHub received a <a href=\"https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2020/11/2020-11-16-RIAA-reversal-effletter.pdf\">letter from the internet freedom advocates at the Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> and realized they&#8217;d been had.</p>\n<p>As the EFF letter explains (and as the technically savvy GitHub must surely have suspected from the start), the YouTube-dl project was never in violation of the DMCA. In the first place, what the RIAA described as a suggestion in the documentation to pirate certain songs is only a test that streams a few seconds of those videos to show that the software is working — well within fair use rights.</p>\n<p>More importantly, the RIAA misconstrues the way YouTube and YouTube-dl&#8217;s code works, mistaking a bit of code on the video site for encryption and concluding that the tool unlawfully circumvents it, violating section 1201 of the DMCA. They also refer to a court case supporting this interpretation.</p>\n<p>In fact, as the EFF explains patiently in its letter, the code does nothing of the sort, and the way YouTube-dl&#8217;s agent &#8220;watches&#8221; a video is indistinguishable to YouTube from a normal user. Everything is conducted in the clear and using no secret codes or back doors. And the court case, the EFF notes, is mistaken and at any rate German and not applicable under U.S. laws.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"8CxhWTgyHg\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/26/european-parliament-votes-for-controversial-copyright-reform/\">European parliament votes for controversial copyright reform (yes, again)</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;European parliament votes for controversial copyright reform (yes, again)&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/26/european-parliament-votes-for-controversial-copyright-reform/embed/#?secret=8CxhWTgyHg\" data-secret=\"8CxhWTgyHg\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>GitHub, perhaps feeling a bit ashamed for having folded so quickly and completely in the face of a shabbily argued nastygram from the RIAA, <a href=\"https://github.blog/2020-11-16-standing-up-for-developers-youtube-dl-is-back/\">announced several changes</a> to prevent such occurrences in the future.</p>\n<p>First, all copyright claims under section 1201 — which are fundamentally dubious — will receive a technical and legal review, and an independent one if necessary, to evaluate the truth of their assertions. If the findings aren&#8217;t decisive, the project will be left up instead of taken down while the proceedings continue. Should the project seem to be in violation, they will be given a chance to amend it before takedown. And if a takedown occurs, the developers will still be able to access important data like pull requests and bug reports.</p>\n<p>Second, GitHub is establishing a $1M developer defense fund that will be used to protect developers on the platform from bad section 1201 claims. After all, faced with the possibility of a court battle, many a poor or hobby developer will simply abandon their work, which is one of the outcomes being counted on by abusers of the DMCA.</p>\n<p>And third, the company will be continuing its lobbying work to amend the DMCA and equivalents around the world, with a specific focus on section 1201 it plans to announce soon.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a happy ending for this little saga, and while DMCA abuse is a serious and ongoing issue, at least the bullies didn&#8217;t get their way this time. Until the law changes this will continue to be an issue, but vigilance and strongly worded letters will do in the meantime.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=AzyAPgrSQSc:JQcd3YfV89k:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=AzyAPgrSQSc:JQcd3YfV89k:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=AzyAPgrSQSc:JQcd3YfV89k:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=AzyAPgrSQSc:JQcd3YfV89k:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=AzyAPgrSQSc:JQcd3YfV89k:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=AzyAPgrSQSc:JQcd3YfV89k:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=AzyAPgrSQSc:JQcd3YfV89k:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=AzyAPgrSQSc:JQcd3YfV89k:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/AzyAPgrSQSc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 16 Nov 2020 18:37:41 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"dd43d767babf1395ab4e6db19ce8ec61","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn12@2020_5/2020/11/17/05-38-40-098_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Devin Coldewey","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn12@2020_5/2020/11/17/05-38-40-098_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn63@2020_3/2020/11/17/05-38-42-840_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn11@2020_6/2020/11/17/05-38-42-593_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=AzyAPgrSQSc:JQcd3YfV89k:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn20@2020_2/2020/11/17/05-38-42-509_01427b3b2437c753.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=AzyAPgrSQSc:JQcd3YfV89k:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn83@2020_5/2020/11/17/05-38-52-394_8609ed0162868879.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn4@2020_3/2020/11/17/05-38-43-522_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/AzyAPgrSQSc":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn18@2020_1/2020/11/17/05-38-52-394_32688edf5201e523.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605591519887},{"createdTime":"2020-11-17 13:38:39","updatedTime":"2020-11-17 13:38:39","title":"Sequoia-backed recycling robot maker AMP Robotics gets its largest purchase order","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2074781","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a href=\"https://www.amprobotics.com/\">AMP Robotics</a>, the manufacturer of robotic recycling systems, has received its largest purchase order from the publicly traded North American waste handling company, Waste Connections.</p>\n<p>The order, for 24 machine learning enabled robotic recycling systems, will be used on container, fiber and residue lines across numerous materials recovery facilities, the company said.</p>\n<p>The AMP technology can be used to recover plastics, cardboard, paper, cans, cartons and many other containers and packaging types reclaimed for raw material processing.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>The tech can tell the difference between high-density polyethylene and polyethylene terephthalate, low-density polyethylene, polypropylene, and polystyrene.

And for folks who don’t want their trash to be monitored and sorted, they could opt out of the program.</p>\n<p>Recyclers like Waste Connections should welcome the commercialization of robots tackling industry problems. Their once-stable business has been turned on its head by trade wars and low unemployment. About two years ago, <a href=\"https://e360.yale.edu/features/piling-up-how-chinas-ban-on-importing-waste-has-stalled-global-recycling\">China decided it would no longer serve as the world’s garbage dump</a> and put strict standards in place for the kinds of raw materials it would be willing to receive from other countries. The result has been higher costs at recycling facilities, which actually are now required to sort their garbage more effectively.</p>\n<p>At the same time, low unemployment rates are putting the squeeze on labor availability at facilities where humans are basically required to hand-sort garbage into recyclable materials and trash.</p>\n<p>AMP Robotics is backed by <a class=\"crunchbase-link\"

Today, they’re on track to surpass half a billion rides globally by 2021, far outpacing early growth in the carbon-heavy ride-hailing industry founded by Uber in 2009.</p>\n<p>That’s a dramatic shift in urban transportation by any measure, and it prompts a simple but important question: How did we get here?</p>\n<p>Understanding the key developments that helped advance micromobility over the past several years can give us valuable insights not only into where the industry is headed, but about how we can successfully shape it to meet the needs of hundreds of millions of current and future riders around the world.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>From vehicle design and data to safety reporting and infrastructure, these five innovative moments have helped fuel the global growth of shared e-scooters and are helping lead cities into a healthier, more sustainable future.</p>\n<h2>#1: Shared scooters launched (fall 2017)</h2>\n<p>The very first fleet of <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/bird\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"bird\">Bird <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> e-scooters was launched in Santa Monica, California in September of 2017. Up until this point, the micromobility industry consisted almost entirely of docked and dockless bike sharing systems that were averaging approximately <a href=\"https://nacto.org/2020/08/27/136-million-trips-taken-on-shared-bikes-and-scooters-across-the-u-s-in-2019/\">35 million trips</a> across the United States every year — more than half of them in New York City alone.</p>\n<p>After an encouraging start, shared e-scooter riders in the U.S. took nearly 39 million trips in 2018 and another <a href=\"https://www.bird.co/blog/one-graph-shows-e-scooters-staggering-popularity/\">86 million the following year</a>. A similar trajectory is being seen across the Atlantic, as nations such as <a href=\"https://www.bird.co/blog/3-most-important-insights-e-scooters-rome/\">Italy</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bird.co/blog/community-informing-bird-first-uk-scooter-trials/\">England</a> and <a href=\"https://ain.ua/en/2020/10/26/scroll-scooters-launches-in-kyiv/\">the Ukraine</a> join a rapidly expanding list of countries including Germany, France, Israel, Spain, Portugal, Belgium, Denmark, Poland and others who have chosen to supplement their urban transportation networks with modern micromobility alternatives.</p>\n<p>Shared scooters can now be found in over 200 cities on almost every continent around the world.</p>\n<h2>#2: First custom-designed shared scooters released (fall 2018)</h2>\n<p>The first e-scooter programs taught us two things very quickly: There’s high demand for this type of micromobility offering, and custom-designed vehicles are necessary to successfully meet that demand.</p>\n<p>The fact is, shared scooters are ridden more frequently, handle more diverse road surfaces and endure more varied weather conditions than privately owned ones. That’s why Bird’s vehicle team unveiled the industry’s first custom-designed e-scooter, the <a href=\"https://www.bird.co/blog/bird-unveils-bird-zero-custom-designed-e-scooter-for-ridesharing-2-0/\">Bird Zero</a>, in October of 2018. Equipped with more battery life, better lighting, enhanced durability and more advanced GPS technology, this was the first in a series of comprehensive vehicle evolutions intended to increase safety, sustainability and lifespan — and it worked. Tens of thousands of these scooters are still in use today, and every month of continued service reduces their <a href=\"https://www.bird.co/blog/scooters-sustainable-mass-transit-itf-report/\">already low per-mile lifetime carbon emissions</a> even further.</p>\n<p>Subsequent custom vehicle designs, including the Bird One and Bird Two, have added onto this foundation, introducing industry-first features such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>On-board diagnostic sensors capable of detecting over 200 faults.</li>\n<li>Vehicle intelligence systems capable of running and reporting <a href=\"https://www.bird.co/blog/bird-vehicle-advantage-explained-3-key-points/\">millions of autonomous fault checks per day.</a></li>\n<li>IP67 or IP68 waterproofing on batteries.</li>\n<li>14,000 mile (22,500 km) battery life, resulting in more than 10 years of average everyday use.</li>\n<li>Mechanical design independently tested to withstand more than <a href=\"https://www.bird.co/blog/automotive-aerospace-engineering-built-most-sustainable-scooter/\">60,000 curbside impacts.</a></li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"Yb401pX5Ak\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/30/the-scooter-battle-for-new-york-city-is-on/\">The scooter battle for New York City is on</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;The scooter battle for New York City is on&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/30/the-scooter-battle-for-new-york-city-is-on/embed/#?secret=Yb401pX5Ak\" data-secret=\"Yb401pX5Ak\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<h2>#3: Comprehensive industry safety report released (spring 2019)</h2>\n<p>Safety has rightly been the most important focus, and the most discussed aspect, of shared micromobility since its inception. It’s why Bird launched the industry’s earliest and most comprehensive <a href=\"https://www.bird.co/blog/bird-launches-safety-campaign/\">free helmets for all riders</a> campaign in January of 2018, along with a host of other safety initiatives.</p>\n<p>In April of 2019, these programs culminated in a comprehensive <a href=\"https://www.bird.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Bird-Safety-Report-April-2019.pdf\">e-scooter safety report</a>. This was the first in-depth look at modern micromobility systems, using accident reports and other data to demonstrate that shared scooters have risks and vulnerabilities similar to bicycles. The report laid the groundwork for cooperative safety measures to be taken by both operators and cities to ensure that not only riders and pedestrians but <em>all</em> road users are protected.</p>\n<p>Over the past year and a half, we’ve used the findings contained within the report, along with others that have since <a href=\"https://www.itf-oecd.org/safe-micromobility\">echoed its findings</a>, to imagine and develop a series of product innovations that are helping set the standard for e-scooter safety across the industry. These include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Shared micromobility’s first <a href=\"https://www.bird.co/blog/bird-offers-helmet-selfie/\">Helmet Selfie feature</a> to promote helmet use.</li>\n<li>Shared micromobility’s first <a href=\"https://www.bird.co/blog/bird-warm-up-mode-help-riders-daily-commutes/\">Warm Up Mode feature</a> to assist new riders.</li>\n<li>The first and most accurate geofencing for e-scooters to create reduced-speed and no-riding zones.</li>\n<li>Responsible data-sharing standards and practices to help cities build new infrastructure for bikes and scooters.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>#4: Open Mobility Foundation created (summer 2019)</h2>\n<p>The last bullet above is particularly important. Cities have a crucial role to play in limiting the number of cars on the road and maximizing the amount of infrastructure available for bikes and scooters. It’s a proven strategy to improve the safety of all road users that depends heavily on one critical input: reliable, standardized data.</p>\n<p>Since our first launch, Bird has been a strong proponent of responsible data sharing with cities. What was lacking, however, was a unified body to help guide and develop mobility data standards across the micromobility industry.</p>\n<p>All of that changed in June of 2019, when cities like Los Angeles, New York and San Francisco came together with companies like Bird and Microsoft and a consortium of nonprofit organizations called OASIS to form the <a href=\"https://www.openmobilityfoundation.org/\">Open Mobility Foundation</a> (OMF). As chairperson and general manager of the LADOT Seleta Reynolds <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/seletareynolds/2019/07/18/why-the-open-mobility-foundation/\">wrote in Forbes</a>, the OMF platform “helps us achieve important city goals like increasing safety, equity, and health outcomes, while lowering emissions, and reducing congestion.”</p>\n<p>These collaborative efforts to manage micromobility systems using open-source code and shared data standards might seem wonky, but they’ve had some very tangible real-world effects. In Atlanta, shared e-scooter data has been used to <a href=\"https://www.bird.co/blog/3-cities-turning-scooter-data-into-infrastructure-improvements/\">quadruple the city’s protected bike lanes</a> by 2021. Santa Monica recently used scooter data to draft and pass an amendment that will add 19 new miles of separated micromobility infrastructure.</p>\n<h2>#5: UK, NY e-scooter programs approved (spring 2020)</h2>\n<p>This year’s decisions by <a href=\"https://www.bird.co/blog/uk-pivots-towards-green-transport-fast-tracked-scooter-trials/\">the UK</a> and the state of <a href=\"https://www.bird.co/blog/new-york-city-council-green-light-shared-e-scooter-pilot/\">New York</a> to legalize shared e-scooters and launch respective pilot programs may not be an innovation, but it’s a crucial development that will ensure the industry tops 500 million rides in 2021.</p>\n<p>From an environmental and urban mobility perspective, London and New York are two of the most important cities in the world. Combined, they’re home to 17 million people and more than 10 million <a href=\"http://content.tfl.gov.uk/technical-note-14-who-travels-by-car-in-london.pdf\">daily car trips</a>. The introduction of e-scooters into these two densely packed and highly mobile cities will have a dramatic impact on daily commuter habits, particularly at a time when public transit ridership is still suffering due to COVID-19. That’s good news for cities, citizens and the environment.</p>\n<p>The data that will be gained from such a high volume of micromobility rides won’t just help inform infrastructure improvements in New York and London. It will be added to a growing body of research that’s rapidly influencing micromobility technology and accelerating its adoption around the world.</p>\n<h2>Looking forward</h2>\n<p>So what can we learn from all of this? What will the first four years and 500 million rides of the shared e-scooter industry tell us about the future of micromobility?</p>\n<p>First, we should expect its growth to continue. Adaptable, environmentally friendly solutions to car congestion and urban pollution were in high demand even before the global spread of the coronavirus in 2020. Now they’re proving themselves to be a necessity. Look for the relationships between cities and operators to strengthen and become more cooperative as scooters transition from a perceived recreational vehicle to an essential part of the urban transportation grid. This will include dramatic, data-informed improvements in protected infrastructure for both cyclists and scooter riders.</p>\n<p>Second, we should anticipate that e-scooter technology will continue to develop around two key pillars: safety and sustainability. This applies as much to the form and functionality of the vehicles themselves as it does to the daily operations that manage them. Longer lifespan, improved battery performance, increased durability and enhanced diagnostics will be the benchmarks by which we measure this progress.</p>\n<p>Finally, we should anticipate that, as the data from hundreds of millions of annual rides continues to accumulate, our understanding of urban mobility needs will become much clearer and more nuanced. Urban planning decisions will be able to be made based on street and hour-specific needs, identifying potentially dangerous areas and taking low-cost, high-impact actions to remedy them.</p>\n<p>If current trends continue, and there’s every reason to believe that they will, the time it takes to add another half-billion e-scooter rides to the global total will very soon shrink from four years to less than one.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"WCkycSr7uh\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/e-scooter-startup-tier-raises-250-million-round-led-by-softbank-vision-fund-2/\">E-scooter startup Tier raises $250 million round led by SoftBank Vision Fund 2</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;E-scooter startup Tier raises $250 million round led by SoftBank Vision Fund 2&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/e-scooter-startup-tier-raises-250-million-round-led-by-softbank-vision-fund-2/embed/#?secret=WCkycSr7uh\" data-secret=\"WCkycSr7uh\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=SvzMGStxAhE:IkQZibBxj08:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=SvzMGStxAhE:IkQZibBxj08:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=SvzMGStxAhE:IkQZibBxj08:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=SvzMGStxAhE:IkQZibBxj08:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=SvzMGStxAhE:IkQZibBxj08:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=SvzMGStxAhE:IkQZibBxj08:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=SvzMGStxAhE:IkQZibBxj08:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=SvzMGStxAhE:IkQZibBxj08:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/SvzMGStxAhE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 16 Nov 2020 18:18:44 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"fbaf28076c2812c57213abeb4614fa95","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn12@2020_5/2020/11/17/05-38-40-098_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Walter Thompson","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn12@2020_5/2020/11/17/05-38-40-098_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn63@2020_3/2020/11/17/05-38-42-840_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn11@2020_6/2020/11/17/05-38-42-593_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=SvzMGStxAhE:IkQZibBxj08:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn72@2020_2/2020/11/17/05-38-42-934_d7fb9796bb0c99b0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=SvzMGStxAhE:IkQZibBxj08:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn3@2020_5/2020/11/17/05-39-02-789_5058aade8b146f77.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn4@2020_3/2020/11/17/05-38-43-522_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/SvzMGStxAhE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn27@2020_2/2020/11/17/05-38-41-650_9bba252871146b7d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605591519887},{"createdTime":"2020-11-17 13:38:39","updatedTime":"2020-11-17 13:38:39","title":"The VC and founder winners in Airbnb’s IPO","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2074639","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">After a tumultuous year for the travel industry, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/airbnb\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"airbnb\">Airbnb’s <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> long-awaited IPO filing just dropped.

Indeed, the company is on track to match its 2018 size, if we have our math correct.</p>\n<p>What changed from the first three quarters of 2019 to the first three quarters of 2020? The biggest thing, apart from expected lower revenue costs — less revenue costs less — is the huge decline in sales and marketing spend at the company. Airbnb slashed S&#38;M outlays from $1.18 billion in the first three quarters of 2019 to just $545.5 million in the same period of 2020.</p>\n<p>So, where will Airbnb wind up in 2020 once it&#8217;s all done? We&#8217;ll need to peek at its quarterly results for that. Here they are:</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2074595\" style=\"width: 869px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2074595\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2074595 size-full\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-16-at-4.53.03-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"859\" height=\"344\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-16-at-4.53.03-PM.png 859w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-16-at-4.53.03-PM.png?resize=150,60 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-16-at-4.53.03-PM.png?resize=300,120 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-16-at-4.53.03-PM.png?resize=768,308 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-16-at-4.53.03-PM.png?resize=680,272 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-16-at-4.53.03-PM.png?resize=50,20 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 859px) 100vw, 859px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2074595\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image Credits: Airbnb S-1</p></div></p>\n<p>Airbnb&#8217;s growth continues in year-over-year terms right until the March 31, 2020 quarter, when it was effectively flat compared to Q1 2019. Or, the company would have grown sans COVID-19. In the June 30, 2020 quarter we see the real damage, with Airbnb&#8217;s revenue falling from $1.2 billion in the year-ago quarter to just $334.8 million. That&#8217;s a shocking decline.</p>\n<p>But, looking ahead to Q3 2020 we see a large return to form. Yes, Airbnb&#8217;s third quarter was smaller than its Q3 2019, with $1.34 billion in top line instead of $1.65 billion in 2019, but the company effectively quadrupled from its preceding quarter. If the company manages another Q3 worth of revenue in Q4, it would be larger than it was in 2018 by a few hundred million.</p>\n<p>Critically, Airbnb managed to swing from a number of unprofitable quarters to a profit in Q3, akin to its 2019 Q3 when it was also in the black. Of course, Airbnb&#8217;s $219.3 million in GAAP net income during the third quarter pales compared to its losses tallied earlier in the year. The company will not break even in 2020.</p>\n<p>Airbnb also reported adjusted profit metrics. Its adjusted EBITDA results are based on the following definition:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income or loss adjusted for (i) provision for income taxes; (ii) interest income, interest expense, and other income (expense), net; (iii) depreciation and amortization; (iv) stock-based compensation expense; (v) net changes to the reserves for lodging taxes for which we may be held jointly liable with hosts for collecting and remitting such taxes; and (vi) restructuring charges.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The decision to remove restructuring costs raised eyebrows, with Amy Cheetham, an investor at Costanoa Ventures, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/amyecheetham/status/1328455278287732737\">saying that</a> &#8220;it feels like leaving out restructuring costs is a little aggressive?&#8221; We agree, as it gives the company too much flexibility to count the good in its results, like lower operating costs, while discounting what it took to get those results, like restructuring its business operations.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s having your cake and eating it as well <em>and</em> not counting the calories.</p>\n<p>Still, who are we to withhold numbers from you? Here is the <em>very</em> adjusted EBITDA that Airbnb claims:</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2074615\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2074615\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2074615 size-large\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-16-at-5.15.23-PM.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"132\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-16-at-5.15.23-PM.png 796w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-16-at-5.15.23-PM.png?resize=150,29 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-16-at-5.15.23-PM.png?resize=300,58 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-16-at-5.15.23-PM.png?resize=768,149 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-16-at-5.15.23-PM.png?resize=680,132 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-16-at-5.15.23-PM.png?resize=50,10 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2074615\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image Credits: Airbnb S-1</p></div></p>\n<p>The numbers are still not good even after ripping out so very any costs. Worse, perhaps is the company&#8217;s cash burn in the year. That deficit helps explain why Airbnb took on more capital when it did earlier this year.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s hard to put a firm grade on this S-1. It contains what we expected, but how investors weigh the company&#8217;s year-over-year revenue declines in Q3 2020 against its rapid comeback from Q2 2020 should help decide its eventual value. On the whole Airbnb has managed something incredibly impressive &#8212; bouncing back from so low a low.</p>\n<p>But, now that it&#8217;s going public we can&#8217;t merely say &#8220;good job&#8221;; it wants to price itself well and trade strongly. So, all eyes on its first IPO range as that should tell us what investors just might be willing to pay for the famous company&#8217;s equity.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"aKBTFqK8kS\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/understanding-airbnbs-summer-recovery/\">Understanding Airbnb&#8217;s summer recovery</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Understanding Airbnb&#8217;s summer recovery&#8221;

After careful consideration and research, my conclusion was basically, &#8220;I think that the Olympics need esports a whole lot more than esports needs the Olympics.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I was surprised by some of the data I uncovered in the course of researching the Olympics piece, specifically on audiences for international, professional and collegiate sports. I observed that while the esports model isn’t as mature as in traditional sports, esports actually garnered close to the same level of viewership, and the audience was growing astronomically. I couldn’t help but wonder how long this phenomenon would go unacknowledged by the institutions that might benefit most from it.</p>\n<p>Enter colleges’ and universities’ flirtation with esports: There are currently more than 170 <a href=\"https://www.athleticbusiness.com/college/wisconsin-colleges-forming-varsity-esports-programs.html\">collegiate varsity gaming programs</a> in NCAA Division I, and the number of clubs is even higher. So even as institutions investment in esports, there are still many misunderstood and overlooked aspects of the potential to drive value (and even revenue) in the collegiate esports space.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<h2>College in the 21st century</h2>\n<p>The college experience today is very different than it was 50 years ago. The pace of change outside of institutions is ever-accelerating, often leaving colleges struggling to keep up. Technology, students’ interests, evolving economies and workplaces, and changes in cultural norms have left colleges and universities in a place of less relevance than at many points in the past. <u></u></p>\n<p>The same can be said of college sports: Outside forces have eroded a once-near-hegemonic source of collegiate pride, cultural power, recruitment, alumni engagement and, in some cases, revenue.</p>\n<p>I did a quick review of the audience for the biggest NCAA events in the world; the Football Bowl Subdivision Bowl Championship and the NCAA Men’s Division I Basketball Tournament.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2074461\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2074461\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2074461\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/https___lh6.googleusercontent.png\" alt=\"pre-championship viewers FBS bowls\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/https___lh6.googleusercontent.png 600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/https___lh6.googleusercontent.png?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/https___lh6.googleusercontent.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/https___lh6.googleusercontent.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2074461\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brandon Byrne</p></div></p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2074462\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2074462\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2074462\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/https___lh3.googleusercontent.png\" alt=\"post-championship viewers\" width=\"600\" height=\"351\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/https___lh3.googleusercontent.png 600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/https___lh3.googleusercontent.png?resize=150,88 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/https___lh3.googleusercontent.png?resize=300,176 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/https___lh3.googleusercontent.png?resize=50,29 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2074462\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brandon Byrne</p></div></p>\n<p>Look at the average viewership of the big bowl games before the championship system went into effect in 2015, as well as after.

So, while collegiate sports still have a massive following, there are two concerning issues here. First, the audience isn’t growing at all; in fact, it appears to be slightly contracting. Secondly, the audience is aging, making collegiate sports less relevant to younger people. While an older audience is still a valuable source of alumni donations and ancillary revenue, it doesn’t exactly align with another core target demographic: potential college students.</p>\n<p>Now despite this, there is data that suggests that schools with elite academic departments do enjoy a phenomenon known as the &#8220;Flutie effect,&#8221; named after Doug Flutie, a quarterback for Boston College whose exciting performance on the gridiron was credited with boosting BC applications. An article in Forbes <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/hbsworkingknowledge/2013/04/29/the-flutie-effect-how-athletic-success-boosts-college-applications/?sh=3ab48e416e96\">breaking down an HBS study</a> goes into the phenomenon more deeply than we can here.</p>\n<p>Granted, much of the data is from a few years ago, when college sports were perhaps more relevant, but the point is broadly the same: Having an elite program in an activity students enjoy benefits the institutions that sponsor and promote them. But what happens when enthusiasm for those activities among the student body is waning? One idea is to explore involvement in what the students of today are interested in.</p>\n<p>As a comparison to FBS football (maxed out at 35 million viewers) and the NCAA Final Four (maxed out at 28 million), Riot Games’ Mid-Season Invitational event for <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/league-of-legends\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"league-of-legends\">League of Legends <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> had a total viewership of <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/507491/esports-tournaments-by-number-viewers-global/#:~:text=The%202018%20Mid%2DSeason%20Invitational,with%2046%20million%20unique%20viewers.\">60 million people</a>. In second place is the Intel Extreme Masters tournament in Katowice with 46 million people. While precise demographic data isn’t readily available, it stands to reason that the latter two events skew younger than the former two.</p>\n<p>A few caveats, as these are not precisely apples-to-apples comparisons: These esports events are broken up over a number of days and encompass a significant number of matches — comparable to March Madness, perhaps — and the content is consumed in different ways. Much of the NCAA’s content is presented on television, some of which is on paid, premium channels. Esports events are broadcast on Twitch and YouTube via streams for free.</p>\n<p>But the thing to understand is that esports audiences are <a href=\"https://influencermarketinghub.com/growth-of-esports-stats/\">growing at a 15%-16%</a> year-over-year clip and it commands a worldwide audience, meaning its total addressable market (TAM) is MUCH bigger. The NCAA events are not likely to draw serious audiences outside of North America.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"M7PHmhdwIg\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/18/why-the-olympics-should-add-esports/\">Why the Olympics should add esports</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Why the Olympics should add esports&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/18/why-the-olympics-should-add-esports/embed/#?secret=M7PHmhdwIg\" data-secret=\"M7PHmhdwIg\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<h2>COVID-19</h2>\n<p>In the context of the pandemic, colleges are hamstrung by students’ inability to engage in a college experience in-person, which is one of the primary reasons one goes to college. Networking, developing new friends and having new experiences are all a part of the collegiate draw, none of which work as well from students’ parents’ living rooms. Similarly, collegiate sports as we know them have essentially ceased to exist, along with their functions of institutional pride, marketing and revenue. The NCAA Tournament was canceled in March of 2020 and there is no sign that it, or any other sport, will be back anytime soon.</p>\n<p>Esports, on the other hand, are thriving in this context, thanks mostly to their ability to offer remote competition and viewing. Esports tournaments can isolate audiences, teams and even referees to allow for safe content creation and consumption.</p>\n<h2>Esports and college</h2>\n<p>Believe it or not, esports is a better fit for college than it is for the pros. I won&#8217;t go into all of the details here, but I actually wrote a separate article about why the <a href=\"https://medium.com/@brandon.byrne/esports-2-0-28099088fae7\">pro sports model is NOT a good one for esports</a>. In this article we talk about intellectual property, who owns the league in esports and how all of the entities make money. The biggest problem is, in pro sports, the teams own the league and can then act in the best interest of all of the teams. In esports, the league is usually owned or regulated by the publisher of the video game, meaning you have hands in the monetization pie in a way that pro sports doesn’t have.</p>\n<p>The interesting thing about this is that college athletics actually has the same problem and has found a way to mitigate that. The athletes get their scholarships, and the schools, their athletic conference, and the NCAA itself all own a piece of the pie that gets packaged and sold for distribution to the ESPNs and Fox Sports of the world.</p>\n<p>This is a much better model for esports. It&#8217;s unlikely that any group that &#8220;owned&#8221; football IP would tell the Dallas Cowboys how to market their team, what their cut is and how it will be distributed. This process happens all the time in college, though. In fact, in order for everyone to get their seat at the table, you HAVE to work all of this out so that the schools make some money (equivalent to a team), the conference makes their money (equivalent to the league) and the NCAA makes their money (equivalent to the publisher themselves). If the chain breaks down at any point, then the whole process grinds to a halt and nobody makes money.</p>\n<p>I mention this in my article about the Olympics. The IOC is used to having full autonomy over how the Olympic Games are broadcast, which events are part of the games, who is eligible and who isn’t, etc. There is no chance this would be the case if the Olympics took on esports. The publisher would absolutely wield an incredible amount of influence over how the games are portrayed, broadcast, judged and the like. The IOC isn’t used to that. In college, that’s just a typical Saturday afternoon.</p>\n<p>College admission is down and not just because of COVID-19. Even before the pandemic, colleges were trying to find their footing with potential students as people reevaluate the college experience. Forbes <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeltnietzel/2019/12/16/college-enrollment-declines-again-its-down-more-than-two-million-students-in-this-decade/?sh=7326921f3d95\">wrote back in 2019</a> that college enrollments were down two million students in that decade.

Revenue is massively down, with even stalwarts like Harvard University <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/3/19/harvard-coronavirus-endowment-impact/\">hemorrhaging cash</a>. With enrollment down before the pandemic, we have reached a point where colleges and universities have to adapt to survive.</p>\n<p>The good news is, I believe that esports could be an opportunity to do just that. Colleges are diving into esports, with 115 different programs offering <a href=\"https://www.edsurge.com/news/2019-02-27-esports-scholarships-are-growing-do-they-leave-some-students-behind\">scholarships for esports</a> and club programs are growing even faster. Certainly, it will help attract students, but <a href=\"https://news.crunchbase.com/news/the-esports-industrys-got-game-despite-monetization-challenges/\">monetization in esports</a> is really tricky.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s critical that colleges and universities get expert advice on how to create an ecosystem that ultimately compensates all of the stakeholders, including the college themselves. It also will require universities to move quickly and get on board with a model that is still being formed in real time. The coronavirus pandemic isn’t going away anytime soon, but I think there will be many colleges that will.

Venetsanopoulos noted that just like Kubernetes showed businesses what a simple and scalable infrastructure could look like, Arrikto can show them what a simpler ML production pipeline can look like &#8212; and do so in a Kubernetes-native way.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2074338\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/constantinos-venetsanopoulos-250x250-1.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2074338\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2074338 size-full\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/constantinos-venetsanopoulos-250x250-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/constantinos-venetsanopoulos-250x250-1.jpg 250w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/constantinos-venetsanopoulos-250x250-1.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/constantinos-venetsanopoulos-250x250-1.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/constantinos-venetsanopoulos-250x250-1.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/constantinos-venetsanopoulos-250x250-1.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/constantinos-venetsanopoulos-250x250-1.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/constantinos-venetsanopoulos-250x250-1.jpg?resize=128,128 128w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2074338\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Arrikto CEO Constantinos Venetsanopoulos. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Arrikto</p></div></p>\n<p>At the core of Arrikto is <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/kubeflow\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"kubeflow\">Kubeflow, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> the <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/google\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"google\">Google <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a>-incubated open-source machine learning toolkit for Kubernetes &#8212; and in many ways, you can think of Arrikto as offering an <a href=\"https://www.arrikto.com/enterprise-kubeflow/\">enterprise-ready version of Kubeflow</a>. Among other projects, the team also built <a href=\"https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/started/workstation/getting-started-minikf/\">MiniKF</a> to run Kubeflow on a laptop and uses <a href=\"https://github.com/kubeflow-kale/kale\">Kale</a>, which lets engineers build Kubeflow pipelines from their JupyterLab notebooks.</p>\n<p>As Venetsanopoulos noted, Arrikto&#8217;s technology does three things: it simplifies deploying and managing Kubeflow, allows data scientists to manage it using the tools they already know, and it creates a portable environment for data science that enables data versioning and data sharing across teams and clouds.</p>\n<p>While Arrikto has stayed off the radar since it launched out of Athens, Greece in 2015, the founding team of Venetsanopoulos and CTO Vangelis Koukis already managed to get a number of large enterprises to adopt its platform. Arrikto currently has more than 100 customers and, while the company isn&#8217;t allowed to name any of them just yet, Venetsanopoulos said they include one of the largest oil and gas companies, for example.</p>\n<p>And while you may not think of Athens as a startup hub, Venetsanopoulos argues that this is changing and there is a lot of talent there (though the company is also using the funding to build out its sales and marketing team in Silicon Valley). &#8220;There&#8217;s top-notch talent from top-notch universities that&#8217;s still untapped. It&#8217;s like we have an unfair advantage,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<div>&#8220;We see a strong market opportunity as enterprises seek to leverage cloud-native solutions to unlock the benefits of machine learning,&#8221; Unusual&#8217;s Vrionis said. &#8220;<span class=\"il\">Arrikto</span> has taken an innovative and holistic approach to MLOps across the entire data, model and code lifecycle.
