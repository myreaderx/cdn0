All five of these large-scale pieces are stunning, but <em>“As American As Apple Pie”</em> <em>{with the woman wearing the Barbie t-shirt}</em> might be my favorite! Here’s an excerpt from the <a href=\"https://www.hauserwirth.com/hauser-wirth-exhibitions/30731-amy-sherald-the-great-american-fact\">gallery’s description</a> of the exhibition:</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>“[Amy Sherald’s] paintings celebrate the Black body at leisure, thereby revealing her subjects’ whole humanity. Sherald’s work thus foregrounds the idea that Black life and identity are not solely tethered to grappling publicly with social issues, and that resistance lies equally in a full interior life and an expansive vision of selfhood in the world.”</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>Not only do the images reflect “whole humanity”, Amy purposely hangs the work a little lower than usual, purposely creating a direct relationship between the viewer and the subject. <em>Sigh.</em> I wish I was eye-to-eye with these beauties right now.</p>\n<h5>*Photography by Joseph Hyde, Installation shots by Fredrik Nilsen Studio, bio photo by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/sheekswinsalways/\">Shaniqua Jarvis</a> for <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/interviewmag/\">Interview Magazine</a></h5>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 22 Sep 2021 08:00:59 +0000","feedId":16219,"bgimg":"https://www.thejealouscurator.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/amysherald.jpg","linkMd5":"9457a5d72e83a33e199cfa7ef0ed0833","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn98@2020_5/2021/10/01/02-32-36-245_7bf5a6969b3902b4.webp","destWidth":584,"destHeight":4812,"sourceBytes":1436678,"destBytes":210670,"author":"the jealous curator","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.thejealouscurator.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/amysherald.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn98@2020_5/2021/10/01/02-32-36-245_7bf5a6969b3902b4.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1633055549402}],"record":{"createdTime":"2021-10-01 10:32:29","updatedTime":"2021-10-01 10:32:29","feedId":16219,"fetchDate":"Fri, 01 Oct 2021 02:32:29 +0000","fetchMs":6584,"handleMs":12725,"totalMs":26758,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":10,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"245d88d7b2d8f26704713c23b090d029","hostName":"us-006*","requestId":"eb344cd99ad848eab260758efd51cd3d_16219","contentType":"application/rss+xml; charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":210670,"bgimgsTotal":1,"bgimgsGithubTotal":1,"articlesImgsTotal":1,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":1,"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx1":1},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-09-07 02:12:21","updatedTime":"2020-10-13 13:30:53","id":16219,"name":"The Jealous Curator","url":"http://www.thejealouscurator.com/blog/feed/","subscriber":206,"website":null,"icon":"https://www.thejealouscurator.com/favicon.ico","icon_jsdelivr":null,"description":"","weekly":null,"link":"https://www.thejealouscurator.com"},"noPictureArticleList":[],"tmpCommonImgCdnBytes":210670,"tmpBodyImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBgImgCdnBytes":0,"extra4":{"start":1633055530066,"total":0,"statList":[{"spend":6612,"msg":"获取xml内容"},{"spend":12725,"msg":"解释文章"},{"spend":0,"msg":"上传封面图到cdn"},{"spend":0,"msg":"修正封面图上传失败重新上传"},{"spend":0,"msg":"正文链接上传到cdn"}]},"extra5":1,"extra6":1,"extra7ImgCdnFailResultVector":[],"extra10_invalidATagHrefValue":{},"extra111_proxyServerAndStatMap":{},"extra12ImgCdnSuccessResultVector":[{"code":1,"isDone":false,"source":"https://www.thejealouscurator.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/amysherald.jpg","sourceStatusCode":200,"destWidth":584,"destHeight":4812,"fixedGithubDest":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn98@2020_5/2021/10/01/02-32-36-245_7bf5a6969b3902b4.webp","sourceBytes":1436678,"destBytes":210670,"targetWebpQuality":75,"feedId":16219,"totalSpendMs":7270,"convertSpendMs":93,"createdTime":"2021-10-01 10:32:29","host":"europe64*","referer":"https://www.thejealouscurator.com/blog/?p=38201","linkMd5ListStr":"9457a5d72e83a33e199cfa7ef0ed0833,9457a5d72e83a33e199cfa7ef0ed0833","githubUser":"myreaderx1","githubHttpCode":201,"extra22GetBytesInfo":"1、没有Referer字段","extra23historyStatusCode":[200],"sourceSize":"1.4 MB","destSize":"205.7 KB","compressRate":"14.7%"}],"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx1":1},"failGithubMap":{}}
