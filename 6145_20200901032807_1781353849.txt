Angie described why any automation was probably still passing, making you think that everything was fine when it’s not. It’s one thing for the elements to be displayed on the page, it’s another thing entirely for them to be displayed in the right place at the right time! </p> \n<p>Angie then took us through how we can use automation to do some visual checking using an API from <a href=\"https://applitools.com/\">Applitools</a> and discussed the pros and cons.</p> \n<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed//4WsvIw581dk?controls=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p> \n<p><strong>Angie’s Website</strong><br /> Angie has a great website with lots of resources:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/?post_type=idea&amp;p=67470/angiejones.tech\">Angie’s Website</a></li> \n</ul> \n<p><strong>Test Automation University</strong><br /> I have completed the Java Programming course that Angie wrote for Test Automation University.

Collections are among the basic building blocks for writing code. Frequently used collections, such as List, Set, and Map, are designed to serve a basic fundamental purpose, but sometimes these collections are not enough, and developers will want to extend them to add new functionality.</p>\n<p>In this hands-on demo, Nikhil extended the Map data structure to create two new collections called a bag (MultiSet) and a multimap (MultiValuedMap) and explained the basics of creating a new collection, adding new APIs, the salient aspects of the new collection, and the various knobs and controls required to make it safe and usable.</p>\n<p>We loved how Nikhil started at the beginning with his presentation and proceeded to take us through it in real time. Nikhil live-coded using IntelliJ IDEA and used Test Driven Development (TDD) to create new collections. You might even pick up an IntelliJ IDEA trick or two while watching Nikhil code! Nikhil asked us to mention that Eclipse Collections has nothing to do with Eclipse IDE and he writes code for Eclipse Collections in IntelliJ IDEA.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wlH_s3sGxTo?controls=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>Code samples</strong><br />\nAll the code from the session is available here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Code respository: <a href=\"https://github.com/nikhilnanivadekar/DIYCollections\">https://github.com/nikhilnanivadekar/DIYCollections</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Eclipse Collections information</strong><br />\nFurther information about Eclipse Collections is available here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Eclipse Collections website: <a href=\"https://www.eclipse.org/collections/\">https://www.eclipse.org/collections/</a></li>\n<li>Eclipse Collections GitHub Repo: <a href=\"https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse-collections\">https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse-collections</a></li>\n<li>Eclipse Collections Kata Repo: <a href=\"https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse-collections-kata\">https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse-collections-kata</a></li>\n<li>Eclipse Collections API Design: <a href=\"http://eclipse.github.io/eclipse-collections-kata/api-design/\">http://eclipse.github.io/eclipse-collections-kata/api-design/</a>#/</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Further Reading</strong><br />\nThese are additional posts provided by Nikhil if you&#8217;re interested in learning more:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>UnifiedSet: <a href=\"https://medium.com/oracledevs/unifiedset-the-memory-saver-25b830745959\">https://medium.com/oracledevs/unifiedset-the-memory-saver-25b830745959</a></li>\n<li>UnifiedMap: <a href=\"https://medium.com/oracledevs/unifiedmap-how-it-works-48af0b80cb37\">https://medium.com/oracledevs/unifiedmap-how-it-works-48af0b80cb37</a></li>\n<li>Bag: <a href=\"https://medium.com/oracledevs/bag-the-counter-2689e901aadb\">https://medium.com/oracledevs/bag-the-counter-2689e901aadb</a></li>\n<li>Multimap: <a href=\"https://medium.com/oracledevs/multimap-how-it-works-a3430f549d35\">https://medium.com/oracledevs/multimap-how-it-works-a3430f549d35</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>What our audience thought of Nikhil&#8217;s demo</strong></p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"es\" dir=\"ltr\">Muy buena presentación de <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NikhilNanivade?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">NikhilNanivade</a> en la <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/JBTechDayforJava?src=hash&#38;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#JBTechDayforJava</a><a href=\"https://t.co/yAWOWPS2mT\">https://t.co/yAWOWPS2mT</a></p>\n<p> CyberneticKoi (@CyberneticKoi) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CyberneticKoi/status/1281597677562736642?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 10, 2020</a></p></blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">THANKS ! <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NikhilNanivade?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@NikhilNanivade</a> Incredible presentation bro <br />&#8220;Technology Day For Java&#8221;<br />cc <a href=\"https://twitter.com/javabsas?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@javabsas</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jetbrains?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@jetbrains</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/JetBrainsLovesJava?src=hash&#38;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#JetBrainsLovesJava</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/JBTechDayforJava?src=hash&#38;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#JBTechDayforJava</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/JetBrainsLovesJava?src=hash&#38;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#JetBrainsLovesJava</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Java?src=hash&#38;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Java</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/JavaBaires?src=hash&#38;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#JavaBaires</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/JavaBsAs?src=hash&#38;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#JavaBsAs</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/JavaProgrammers?src=hash&#38;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#JavaProgrammers</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/javaArgentina?src=hash&#38;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#javaArgentina</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/loveJavaProgramming?src=hash&#38;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#loveJavaProgramming</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Jug?src=hash&#38;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Jug</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/Gm6INLjlBe\">pic.twitter.com/Gm6INLjlBe</a></p>\n<p>— C:\\Users\\Mauri\\Java (MauriDeveloper) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MauriDeveloper/status/1281605528305770496?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 10, 2020</a></p></blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/NikhilNanivade?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">NikhilNanivade</a> implemented Bag and Multimap classes in 45min using TDD.

This could mean:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The company is unhappy because features are taking longer to build, and they cannot react fast enough to market demands.</li>\n<li>Developers are unhappy because the code is messy and negatively affects their productivity.</li>\n<li>Testers are unhappy because of the volume of work they have and because they still cannot guarantee the quality of the software.</li>\n<li>Clients are becoming disenchanted because of the lack of quality and low frequency of updates.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Strategic software cannot become a burden to the organisation – they need to remain strategic and continuously enable business agility. Sandro&#8217;s presentation contained a wealth of valuable insights for the end to end journey from common drivers through to strategic stakeholder alignment.</p>\n<p>Sandro also spoke about common impediments (there&#8217;s a lot of them!) as well as the principles of software modernisation that businesses could use as a guide on their journey to ensure business value.</p>\n<p>We liked this presentation because it&#8217;s a step back from what we normally talk about &#8211; instead learning about improvements at the code-level, we learnt about how to see things from an organisational level. So often as developers we see new technologies, new patterns, new versions of Java that we think will make our lives and our applications better, but making these updates is not prioritised by &#34;the business&#34;. Sandro talked about the things that developers can learn in order to sell &#34;the business&#34; (your team leads, the business owners, or maybe someone else) on the value of making the changes we want to see.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tXiBhxLbGUA?controls=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>Further resources</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://codurance.com/\">https://codurance.com/</a> </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>What our audience thought of Sandro&#8217;s presentation</strong></p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/sandromancuso?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@sandromancuso</a> kicking off delivering his talk on &#8220;Software Modernisation&#8221; to the global <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jetbrains?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@jetbrains</a> audience.

IntelliJ IDEA has two shortcuts that can get you out of almost any kind of trouble: <kbd>Shift+Shift</kbd> to run <strong>Search Everywhere</strong> and <kbd>Alt+Enter</kbd> to invoke <strong>Context Actions</strong>.</p>\n<p>In one of the <a href=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2020/05/when-the-shift-hits-the-fan-search-everywhere/\">previous</a> <strong>IntelliJ IDEA: how2pro</strong> blog posts, we talked about the <strong>Search Everywhere</strong> feature and how you can use it to search for code elements and even disable and enable IDE actions or assign shortcuts. Today, let&#8217;s dive deeper into <strong>Context Actions</strong>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/idea-screenshot_2019-09-20_at_14.03.20.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><span id=\"more-68356\"></span></p>\n<p><strong>Context Actions</strong> become available to you in the editor as you type. They differ depending on your current context and the code that you’re working with. In a nutshell, context actions help you fix problems and improve your code. In reality, they incorporate a vast amount of quick-fixes and suggestions that can correct and improve your code, add code elements, upload missing components, create classes and methods, and do many other amazing things.</p>\n<p>Whenever you see a yellow or red light bulb icon in the editor, press <kbd>Alt+Enter</kbd>, because IntelliJ IDEA has tips to offer.</p>\n<h2>Fix code problems</h2>\n<p>The most powerful tool in IntelliJ IDEA that operates by means of <kbd>Alt+Enter</kbd> is code inspections. Pressing this shortcut on a highlighted code element in the editor opens a list of possible fixes from which you can select the one that works best. If you’re not sure how a certain fix is going to change your code, you can open the preview by pressing <kbd>Alt+Space</kbd> on macOS or <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+I</kbd> on Windows and Linux on a suggestion in the list.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/context-actions-inspection-preview.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>By the way, if the widget in the top-right corner tells you that there are problems in your current file, don’t scroll down and look for them. Click the widget to open the list of problems in the <strong>Problems</strong> tool window. There, you can deal with each problem, from errors to typos, by pressing <kbd>Alt+Enter</kbd> without having to jump between the tool window and the editor.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/context-actions-problems-tool-window.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Learn more about how to deal with code problems from <a href=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2020/08/working-with-code-problems-in-intellij-idea/\">this blog post</a>.</p>\n<h2>Add missing libraries</h2>\n<p>If you&#8217;re using a piece of code from a library that has not yet been added to your project, it will be highlighted in red as an error. To quickly fix that, press <kbd>Alt+Enter</kbd> and select the necessary library from the list. The IDE will download and install it for you.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/context-actions-add-lib-with-quickfix.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h2>Add missing import statements</h2>\n<p>Pasting code from elsewhere? If the inserted code block has a class or a method that has not yet been imported, you’ll see an error.</p>\n<p>Normally, you’d have to go up to the beginning of the file and add the missing statement manually. IntelliJ IDEA has a faster solution: it shows you the most suitable import statement in a popup right in the editor. If the suggested fix works for you, press <kbd>Alt+Enter</kbd>, and the IDE will add the import statement for you. If there are several options, pressing <kbd>Alt+Enter</kbd> opens a list of options from which you can pick the most suitable one.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/context-actions-add-import-statement.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h2>Inject another language</h2>\n<p>Sometimes, you need to work on small elements of code in other languages embedded in your project. For example, these can be fragments of HTML code in Java, regular expressions, or SQL queries.</p>\n<p>Type the code that you want to embed, press <kbd>Alt+Enter</kbd> and select <strong>Inject language or reference</strong>. After, pick the necessary language from the list and get code completion, inspections, highlighting, and even a dedicated editor for the injected code.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/context-actions-injections.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>If you want to learn more about language injections, we have an entire <a href=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2020/06/language-injections-in-intellij-idea/\">blog post</a> dedicated to this feature.</p>\n<h2>Create test classes</h2>\n<p><strong>Context Actions</strong> make the process of creating tests easy and quick. All you need to do is to place the caret at the production class for which you want to create a new test, press <kbd>Alt+Enter</kbd>, and select <strong>Create Test</strong>.</p>\n<p>IntelliJ IDEA will prompt you to select or download the necessary library if it’s missing, specify the destination package, and even select the methods for which the IDE will generate new test methods.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/context-actions-create-test.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Content Actions</strong> are designed to help you code comfortably. They’re always ready to optimize your code and provide fixes to all sorts of problems soon as you press <kbd>Alt+Enter</kbd>.</p>\n<p>What’s your favorite <strong>Content Action</strong> in IntelliJ IDEA?

Not only does it help you to identify inconsistencies, but it also makes navigating to the responsible lines much easier.</p>\n<p>There are many ways to set a target execution line during debugging. You can use breakpoints, or step to the line using the <em>Step Over</em> (<em>F8</em>), <em>Step Into</em> (<em>F7</em>), and <em>Run to Cursor</em> (<em>⌥F9</em>) commands. But what if you want to jump to a particular line and set an execution point there, without executing the preceding code? </p>\n<p>Surprisingly, at the moment you can only do this with the help of workarounds, and this is where the <em>Jump to Line </em>plugin comes in handy. When the program is suspended, this plugin allows you to drag and drop an arrow in the Gutter area, putting an execution point at the desired line. This saves you time because instead of performing several actions – like setting a breakpoint and waiting for the program to pause, or applying a two-handed shortcut combination – you can just hover your mouse to the exact place you want to be. </p>\n<p><em>Jump to Line </em>enables you to move either forward or backward within a function. When you drag the arrow, the IDE highlights in green the code lines at which you can set execution points. </p>\n<p>With the plugin, you can interrupt the control flow. For example, you can change the if-else branch. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/debugger1.gif\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n</p>\n<p>What’s more, you can force the loop to break, or restart it from any iteration. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/debugger3.gif\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n</p>\n<p>If you need to move back but do not want to use <em>Drop Frame</em> to rewind the execution of your code, <em>Jump to Line</em> works for you. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/debugger4.gif\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Limitations</strong></p>\n<p>Remember the following when you move back and forth through your code:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Making changes to some lines may break the workflow. That’s why the IDE will highlight them in yellow. You can still move to them, but you need to be aware of possible consequences.</li>\n<li>If you press and hold the <em>Ctrl / ⌘ </em>button while dragging the arrow, the IDE will highlight all the lines in green.

Marit showed us how to find projects to contribute to and how to connect with the community to make sure our contributions are useful.</p>\n<p>We loved how Marit acknowledged that it can be scary to get started in contributing to the open source community and shared her own journey and the mistakes along the way. Marit called out that open source projects need many different types of contributions including code, answering questions, documentation, and testing.</p>\n<p>There are several steps to the practicalities of contributing to open source which Marit also took us through, including setting up your environment and encouraging us to ask our questions and discuss our intentions with the project owners.

Let’s have a more in-depth look at the updates in this release.</p>\n<h2 id=\"docker\"><strong>Docker</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Use Selenoid for cross-browser testing of web applications</strong></p>\n<p>Selenoid (available only in IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate) is an implementation of the Selenium hub for Docker, which allows you to execute automated tests on web browsers running in Docker containers. For each test, Selenoid creates a container with the specified web browser, environment, and settings.</p>\n<p>With IntelliJ IDEA 2020.2 and the <a href=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2020/03/intellij-idea-2020-1-selenium-support/\">Selenium</a> plugin, you don’t need to manually run Selenoid from the command line. You can now select the <em>browsers.json</em> file and click the <em>Launch</em> action in the editor. The IDE will automatically pull all the required containers with the browsers, and run the main Selenoid container to manage them. There are additional options available in the Selenoid run configuration settings, such as output destination folders for logs and videos.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/selenoid.gif\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Connect to Docker on Windows with TLS</strong></p>\n<p>Previously, to connect to Docker, you had to expose a non-TLS connection in the Docker preferences. In IntelliJ IDEA 2020.2, you can connect to Docker securely with TLS without performing any additional actions.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Docker.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"kubernetes_intellij_idea_ultimate\"><strong>Kubernetes (IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate) </strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Add </strong><strong>custom</strong><strong> configuration </strong><strong>files</strong><strong> for a cluster connection</strong></p>\n<p>We continue to add ways to customize the Kubernetes tools to your needs. This time, we’ve made it possible to add your own <code>kubeconfig</code> files to configure access to a cluster.  </p>\n<p>To do this, click the <em>Show Settings</em> button in the <em>Services</em> tool window when selecting a <em>kubernetes </em>root item. Alternatively, go to <em>Preferences / Settings | Build, Execution, Deployment | Kubernetes</em>. Before you apply the settings, you can choose whether to set this path only for the current project or to let the IDE use it globally. </p>\n<p>IntelliJ IDEA starts using the newly configured file automatically. However, if you have made configuration changes, you need to click the new <em>Refresh Configuration</em> button in the <em>Services</em> tool window to apply them. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/multiple_contexts.gif\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Switch contexts </strong><strong>for more efficient work with multiple clusters</strong></p>\n<p>A context is a group of access parameters such as cluster, user, and namespace. When you deal with multiple clusters, you’ll want quick access to contexts. Starting from IntelliJ IDEA 2020.2, you can switch contexts quickly with the <em>Context </em>button in the <em>Services</em> tool window. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/switchcontexts.gif\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><strong>View</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Custom</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Resource</strong><strong> Definitions (CRDs)</strong><strong> in a cluster</strong></p>\n<p>In IntelliJ IDEA 2020, you can view a list of all the existing custom schemas and resources created on a cluster. Here’s the new feature in action. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/CRD.gif\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>In the previous release, we introduced the ability to apply CRDs and other resource files using the <em>Apply </em>icon in the gutter. The applied CRD is then shown inside the <em>Custom Resources</em> item in the <em>Services</em> tool window tree. </p>\n<p>To work with сustom resources in the IDE editor, you need to add a path to your CRD via <em>Preferences / Settings | Languages &#38; frameworks | Kubernetes</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Get full support for </strong><strong>ConfigMaps and Secrets</strong></p>\n<p>IntelliJ IDEA fully supports the Kubernetes ConfigMaps and Secrets API objects. Complete with editor completion, resolve, rename, and find usages. Now the information for these options is not only taken from your project but also the configured cluster. </p>\n<p>If you call completion for ConfigMap names and keys, the IDE will offer suggestions. The items from the cluster are marked in blue, all others are only present in the current project. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-08-07-at-12.55.35.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>It is now possible to call <em>Find Usages</em> from the cluster for ConfigMaps/Secrets and their keys. Select the corresponding item in the <em>Services</em> tool window and call <em>Find Usages</em> in the context menu. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/find_usages.gif\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Now you can navigate from the ConfigMap/Secret usages to their declarations in the project and cluster. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/navigate2.gif\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Another useful time-saving update is the possibility to rename ConfigMaps/Secrets and their keys. When you rename these API objects, the IDE will apply the changes to wherever you have referenced them. This feature is available for sources only. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/rename-1.gif\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Please feel free to share your feedback on the current updates on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jetbrains?lang=en\">Twitter</a> or in our <a href=\"https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issues/idea?_ga=2.67760913.1871016638.1595851282-1683505809.1594742857&#38;_gac=1.250359474.1594731129.EAIaIQobChMIlLPVsOTM6gIVDywYCh1mpQKFEAAYASAAEgJ4P_D_BwE\">issue tracker</a>. </p>\n<p>We hope you are excited about our brand-new features to help you with your daily work with Kubernetes and Docker.

In this tutorial we&#8217;re going to see some shortcuts that you can use to make it easier to write and edit code.</p>\n<h2>Focusing Our Workspace</h2>\n<p>The most useful shortcut to help you focus on your code is <strong>⇧⌘F12</strong> on macOS, or <strong>Ctrl</strong>+<strong>Shift</strong>+<strong>F12 </strong>on Windows and Linux. This hides all the other windows so the editor takes the full space available. It&#8217;s worth using this shortcut when you start working on something to <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/ide-viewing-modes.html\">minimise distractions and maximise space</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IntelliJ-Full-Screen.png\" alt=\"IntelliJ Full Screen\" /></p>\n<h2>Editor Shortcuts</h2>\n<p>There are several <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/working-with-source-code.html#editor_lines_code_blocks\">editor shortcuts</a> that you can use to speed up your workflows, for example, <strong>⌘⌫</strong>, (or <strong>Ctrl</strong>+<strong>Y</strong>), to delete the current line.</p>\n<p>To <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/working-with-source-code.html#editor_lines_code_blocks\">cut a line</a>, press <strong>⌘X</strong>, or <strong>Ctrl</strong>+<strong>X,</strong> without selecting or highlighting anything. This saves a few keystrokes. We can paste this line using <strong>⌘V</strong>, or <strong>Ctrl</strong>+<strong>V</strong>, like in any application.</p>\n<p>Like cut, we can copy a whole line with <strong>⌘C</strong>, or <strong>Ctrl</strong>+<strong>C</strong>, without having to highlight it first, and paste this too. Sometimes it might be more useful to <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/working-with-source-code.html#editor_lines_code_blocks\">duplicate the line</a> instead with <strong>⌘D</strong>, or <strong>Ctrl</strong>+<strong>D</strong>.</p>\n<p>Try it out with the code below:</p>\n<p><pre class=\"EnlighterJSRAW\" data-enlighter-language=\"\">public class MultiLineStrings {\n    public void multiLineStrings() {\n        // Pressing Command+X or CTRL+X will cut the line\n        // Pressing Command+V or CTRL+V will paste the line\n        // Pressing Command+C or CTRL+C will copy the line\n        // Pressing Command+D or CTRL+D will duplicate the line\n        String someText = &#34;This code can be on a single line &#34; +\n                &#34;or it can be on multiple lines &#34; +\n                &#34;and you can type and hit Enter and get the + sign &#34; +\n                &#34;inserted automatically&#34;;\n    }\n}</pre></p>\n<h2>Moving Code</h2>\n<p>To <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/working-with-source-code.html#17953c\">move a statement up</a> use <strong>⇧⌘↑</strong>, or <strong>Ctrl</strong>+<strong>Shift</strong>+<strong>Up</strong> <strong>Arrow</strong>. Moving a statement moves the Java statement as a whole. Applying this to the line with the variable declaration will move the whole statement, in this case the whole multi-line string declaration. The move is context sensitive, so in this case the IDE won&#8217;t let us move it out of the method. Use <strong>⇧⌘↓</strong>, or <strong>Ctrl</strong>+<strong>Shift</strong>+<strong>Down</strong> <strong>Arrow</strong>, to move it down</p>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-55173 size-full\" style=\"border: 1px solid #AAAAAA;\" src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/MoveStatementUpDown-1.png\" alt=\"Animated GIF showing how to move statements up and down\" width=\"750\" height=\"300\" data-gif-src=\"https://resources.jetbrains.com/storage/products/blog/wp-content/uploads/Java/MoveStatementUpDown.gif\" /></p>\n<p>If you want to <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/working-with-source-code.html#179512\">move just a line</a>, or move something without factoring in code context, you can move a line up with <strong>⌥⇧↑</strong>, or <strong>Alt</strong>+<strong>Shift</strong>+<strong>Up</strong> <strong>Arrow</strong>. This means you can move the line anywhere. If we select more than one line and use the shortcut, it will move all highlighted lines.</p>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-55173 size-full\" style=\"border: 1px solid #AAAAAA;\" src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/MoveLineUpDown.png\" alt=\"Animated GIF showing how to move lines up and down\" width=\"750\" height=\"300\" data-gif-src=\"https://resources.jetbrains.com/storage/products/blog/wp-content/uploads/Java/MoveLineUpDown.gif\" /></p>\n<h2>Manipulating Strings</h2>\n<p>One of the simplest but most useful editor features is <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/working-with-source-code.html#editor_lines_code_blocks\">creating a line break</a> in the middle of a declared String using <strong>Enter</strong>. IntelliJ IDEA will automatically close off the String on the line above, add the ‘+’ symbol for concatenation, and reopen the String on the line below. Try it out with the code below, press <strong>Enter</strong> somewhere inside the String value:</p>\n<p><pre class=\"EnlighterJSRAW\" data-enlighter-language=\"\">public class MultiLineStrings {\n    public void multiLineStrings() {\n\n        // Ctrl+Shift+J will join lines\n        // Pressing Enter in String will auto-insert +\n        String someText = &#34;This code can be on a single line &#34; +\n                &#34;or it can be on multiple lines &#34; +\n                &#34;and you can type and hit Enter and get the + sign &#34; +\n                &#34;inserted automatically&#34;;\n    }\n}</pre></p>\n<p>To <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/working-with-source-code.html#editor_lines_code_blocks\">join the lines together</a>, use <strong>⌃⇧J</strong>, or <strong>Ctrl</strong>+<strong>Shift</strong>+<strong>J</strong>. This is extremely helpful for formatting multiline strings, and for laying out block comments.</p>\n<p>As well as pressing <strong>⏎</strong>, or <strong>Enter</strong>, to split the line and put the caret on the new line, you can also use <strong>⌘⏎</strong>, or <strong>Ctrl</strong>+<strong>Enter</strong>, to split the line but keep the caret on the current line.</p>\n<h2>Selecting Code</h2>\n<p>You can use <strong>⌥↑</strong>, or <strong>Ctrl</strong>+<strong>W,</strong> to <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/working-with-source-code.html#editor_code_selection\">extend your selection</a> to include ever-increasing, valid blocks of code. Use <strong>⌥↓</strong>, or <strong>Ctrl</strong>+<strong>Shift</strong>+<strong>W</strong>, to decrease the selection back to where you started.</p>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-55173 size-full\" style=\"border: 1px solid #AAAAAA;\" src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ExtendShrinkSelection.png\" alt=\"Animated GIF showing how to expand and shrink chunks of code\" width=\"750\" height=\"300\" data-gif-src=\"https://resources.jetbrains.com/storage/products/blog/wp-content/uploads/Java/ExtendShrinkSelection.gif\" /></p>\n<h2>Working with Linear Formats</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/working-with-source-code.html#17962e\">Column Selection Mode</a> is a useful tool for manipulating code or text and working with linear formats. You can search for it in two ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Find Action <strong>⌘⇧A, </strong>or <strong>CTRL</strong>+<strong>SHIFT</strong>+<strong>A</strong></li>\n<li>Search Everywhere <strong>⇧⇧, or SHIFT</strong>+<strong>SHIFT</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Then type in <strong>Column Select</strong>.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, use the shortcut <strong>⇧⌘8</strong>, or <strong>Shift</strong>+<strong>Alt</strong>+<strong>Ins</strong>. Once you’re in column selection mode, you can hold down shift and press up or down to create carets in a column above or below where you are. The same shortcut toggles off Column Selection Mode.</p>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-55173 size-full\" style=\"border: 1px solid #AAAAAA;\" src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ColumnSelectionMode.png\" alt=\"Animated GIF showing how to expand and shrink chunks of code\" width=\"750\" height=\"300\" data-gif-src=\"https://resources.jetbrains.com/storage/products/blog/wp-content/uploads/Java/ColumnSelectionMode.gif\" /></p>\n<h2>Manipulating Caret Placement</h2>\n<p>To <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/working-with-source-code.html#multiple_cursor\">place multiple carets</a> in specific places, hold down <strong>⌥⇧</strong>, or <strong>Alt</strong>+<strong>Shift</strong>, and use the mouse to click where you want the next caret to be. As you type, each caret will output the same thing. This might be useful when making multiple changes to XML files, for example. To get back to your original caret, press <strong>Escape</strong>.</p>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-55173 size-full\" style=\"border: 1px solid #AAAAAA;\" src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/MultipleCarets.png\" alt=\"Animated GIF showing how to use and place multiple carets\" width=\"750\" height=\"300\" data-gif-src=\"https://resources.jetbrains.com/storage/products/blog/wp-content/uploads/Java/MultipleCarets.gif\" /></p>\n<p>To clone the caret above or below the line you are on, press <strong>⌥</strong>, or <strong>Alt</strong>, and then <strong>⌥</strong>, or <strong>Alt</strong>, a second time, but this time keep holding down <strong>⌥</strong>, or <strong>Alt</strong>.  Press down to create another caret directly below the line. Again, this is useful for column based formatting or edits. Press <strong>Escape</strong> to go back to one caret. Similarly, press <strong>⌥</strong>, or <strong>Alt</strong> twice, holding down the <strong>⌥</strong>, or <strong>Alt</strong> on the second time and press the <strong>↑</strong>, or <strong>Up</strong> <strong>Arrow</strong>, to clone the caret to the line above.</p>\n<h2>Finding a Word in the File</h2>\n<p>As well as using <strong>⌘F</strong>, or <strong>Ctrl</strong> <strong>F</strong>, to find something, you can use <strong>⌘G</strong>, or <strong>F3</strong>, to <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/working-with-source-code.html#select-occurrences\">find the next occurrence of the word</a> currently at the caret, and move to it. Alternatively, use <strong>⌃⌘G</strong>, or <strong>Ctrl</strong>+<strong>Alt</strong>+<strong>Shift</strong>+<strong>J</strong> to select all instances of the current word.</p>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-55173 size-full\" style=\"border: 1px solid #AAAAAA;\" src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/FindNextWord.png\" alt=\"Animated GIF showing how to select all instances of the same word\" width=\"750\" height=\"300\" data-gif-src=\"https://resources.jetbrains.com/storage/products/blog/wp-content/uploads/Java/FindNextWord.gif\" /></p>\n<h2>Select and Surround</h2>\n<p>To add quotes around a word or words, highlight the text and type the quote. This also works for all types of brackets. The quotes or brackets will be placed directly outside the highlighted text.</p>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-55173 size-full\" style=\"border: 1px solid #AAAAAA;\" src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/WordWrappingQuotesBrackets.png\" alt=\"Animated GIF showing how to wrap words with quotes and brackets\" width=\"750\" height=\"300\" data-gif-src=\"https://resources.jetbrains.com/storage/products/blog/wp-content/uploads/Java/WordWrappingQuotesBrackets.gif\" /></p>\n<h2>IntelliJ IDEA Clipboard</h2>\n<p>Finally, IntelliJ IDEA keeps a record of everything that was copied inside the IDE. To <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/pro-tips.html#paste-from-history\">paste an item</a> that was copied in IntelliJ IDEA in the past, use <strong>⇧⌘V</strong>, or <strong>Ctrl</strong>+<strong>Shift</strong>+<strong>V</strong>. All the items copied or cut in the past are shown and we can use the keyboard to navigate them. We can even copy sections of the copied code for later use. You might notice from this example that the editor and other sections of IntelliJ IDEA support emojis on macOS.<br />\n<img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Clipboard_IntelliJ.png\" alt=\"Clipboard in IntelliJ\" /><br />\nYou don&#8217;t have to use the arrow keys to move all the way down to the item you want in the History window. Just type the number next to the history item to paste, for example number 1.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s a small selection of <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/mastering-keyboard-shortcuts.html\">shortcuts</a> to help you write code, or text, in IntelliJ IDEA.</p>\n<p>See also:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2020/04/tips-for-writing-code-in-intellij-idea/\" title=\"Tips for writing code in IntelliJ IDEA\">Tips for writing code in IntelliJ IDEA</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2020/03/top-15-intellij-idea-shortcuts/\" title=\"Top 15 IntelliJ IDEA Shortcuts\">Top 15 IntelliJ IDEA Shortcuts</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thanks for reading!</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 06 Aug 2020 13:00:42 +0000","feedId":6145,"bgimg":"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IntelliJ-Full-Screen.png","linkMd5":"37840ec2907b90de466c289481dc1568","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn36@2020_1/2020/09/01/03-25-53-047_0eaaba461d93f96b.webp","destWidth":2784,"destHeight":1618,"sourceBytes":589251,"destBytes":173172,"author":"Helen Scott","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IntelliJ-Full-Screen.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn36@2020_1/2020/09/01/03-25-53-047_0eaaba461d93f96b.webp","https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/MoveStatementUpDown-1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn78@2020_2/2020/09/01/03-26-06-487_34fb9680e2925a27.webp","https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/MoveLineUpDown.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn42@2020_4/2020/09/01/03-26-06-769_a1bd4988b40dc477.webp","https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ExtendShrinkSelection.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn94@2020_5/2020/09/01/03-26-06-407_ed566171df4b4133.webp","https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ColumnSelectionMode.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn70@2020_3/2020/09/01/03-26-06-549_cb841e5569c6ee43.webp","https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/MultipleCarets.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn66@2020_2/2020/09/01/03-26-06-474_058ee47c25447628.webp","https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/FindNextWord.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn49@2020_4/2020/09/01/03-26-06-429_79442566f97d59d4.webp","https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/WordWrappingQuotesBrackets.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn26@2020_5/2020/09/01/03-26-06-538_7bed84098746591c.webp","https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Clipboard_IntelliJ.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn38@2020_5/2020/09/01/03-26-06-479_44ba2355346d8e6a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598930749760},{"createdTime":"2020-09-01 11:25:49","updatedTime":"2020-09-01 11:25:49","title":"Migrating from JUnit 4 to JUnit 5","link":"https://blog.jetbrains.com/?post_type=idea&p=61663","description":"<p>This post will help you take your project from previous versions of JUnit to JUnit5.

Many applications will have a large number of JUnit tests written using JUnit 4. <a href=\"https://junit.org/junit5/\">JUnit 5</a> was released in 2017, and provides a lot of features that weren&#8217;t in the previous version. This blog shows you how to migrate existing JUnit 4 tests to JUnit 5 using <a href=\"https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-samples/blob/9afc1e77d269e0d4a0cbcf57f9862e9b321f2e68/standard-java/src/test/com/jetbrains/testing/JUnit4To5.java\">this java class</a> initially. All the code before the migration we will go through <a href=\"https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-samples/tree/b52a483d0d6fe612ea4ef3f727792a10795061f8\">is available here</a>.</p>\n<p>A typical JUnit 4 test contains sections:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>code to run once at the start of all the tests<br />\n<pre class=\"EnlighterJSRAW\" data-enlighter-language=\"\">@BeforeClass\npublic static void beforeClass() throws Exception {\nSystem.out.println(&#34;JUnit4To5.beforeClass&#34;);\n}</pre></li>\n<li>code to run before each individual test<br />\n<pre class=\"EnlighterJSRAW\" data-enlighter-language=\"\">@Before\npublic void before() throws Exception {\nSystem.out.println(&#34;JUnit4To5.before&#34;);\n}</pre></li>\n<li>the tests themselves, some of which may be ignored<br />\n<pre class=\"EnlighterJSRAW\" data-enlighter-language=\"\">@Test\npublic void shouldMigrateASimpleTest() {\nAssert.assertEquals(&#34;expected&#34;, &#34;expected&#34;);\n}\n@Test\n@Ignore\npublic void shouldMigrateIgnoreTestToDisabledTest() {\n// This test is Ignored in JUnit 4 and should be Disabled in JUnit 5&#34;\n}</pre></li>\n<li>code to run to clean up after each test<br />\n<pre class=\"EnlighterJSRAW\" data-enlighter-language=\"\">@After\npublic void after() throws Exception {\nSystem.out.println(&#34;JUnit4To5.after&#34;);\n}</pre></li>\n<li>code to run once to clean up after all tests<br />\n<pre class=\"EnlighterJSRAW\" data-enlighter-language=\"\">@AfterClass\npublic static void afterClass() throws Exception {\nSystem.out.println(&#34;JUnit4To5.afterClass&#34;);\n}</pre></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This project is currently using JUnit 4.13, but these guidelines apply to any version of JUnit 4. We also have a dependency on Hamcrest. We need to edit our <a href=\"https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-samples/blob/9afc1e77d269e0d4a0cbcf57f9862e9b321f2e68/standard-java/pom.xml\" title=\"Maven POM file\">Maven POM file</a>.</p>\n<p><pre class=\"EnlighterJSRAW\" data-enlighter-language=\"\">&#60;!-- start of pom.xml is above here --&#62;\n       &#60;dependency&#62;\n           &#60;groupId&#62;junit&#60;/groupId&#62;\n           &#60;artifactId&#62;junit&#60;/artifactId&#62;\n           &#60;version&#62;4.13&#60;/version&#62;\n           &#60;scope&#62;test&#60;/scope&#62;\n       &#60;/dependency&#62;\n       &#60;dependency&#62;\n           &#60;groupId&#62;org.hamcrest&#60;/groupId&#62;\n           &#60;artifactId&#62;hamcrest-library&#60;/artifactId&#62;\n           &#60;version&#62;2.2&#60;/version&#62;\n       &#60;/dependency&#62;\n&#60;!-- rest of pom.xml below --&#62;</pre></p>\n<p>The first thing we need to do in order to migrate to JUnit 5 is to add the JUnit 5 dependencies. We can get IntelliJ IDEA to do this for us, if we press <strong>⌃⏎</strong> or, <strong>Alt</strong>+<strong>Enter</strong> within the POM file, the IDE will offer the option of adding a new dependency.</p>\n<p>Typing &#8216;JUnit&#8217; will show junit-jupiter dependencies, which are the JUnit 5 dependencies. To start with let&#8217;s add a dependency on the basic junit-jupiter-api. IntelliJ IDEA has identified that 5.7.0-M1 (milestone one) is the latest dependency. Let&#8217;s use a release version rather than a milestone, so use the drop-down to select 5.6.2 as this is the current release version.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/junit-jupiter-562.png\" alt=\"Junit Jupiter 5.6.2\" /></p>\n<p>Because we want to run existing JUnit 4 tests with JUnit 5, we need to add one more dependency. Use <strong>⌃⏎</strong>, or , <strong>Alt</strong>+<strong>Enter</strong> again and this time look for the JUnit vintage engine to run older tests. Once again, IntelliJ IDEA is suggesting version 5.7.0-M1. Expand the menu item using the right arrow and select version 5.6.2 so we’re using the same version as the API.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/junit-vintage-562-2.png\" alt=\"Junit Vintage Engine 5.6.2\" /></p>\n<p>IntelliJ IDEA will update the Maven POM file with the new dependency version and imports. Click the Maven icon in the top-right to ensure that IntelliJ IDEA loads the changes.

In particular there are a number of inspections for JUnit tests.</p>\n<p>To help with the migration, turn on ‘JUnit 4 test can be JUnit 5’ inspection. You can only turn this on if you’re using at least Java 8 and have JUnit 5 dependencies set up.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/junit4-can-be-5.png\" alt=\"Junit 4 can be 5\" /></p>\n<p>Let’s open the Junit4ToJUnit5 test class to see this in action:</p>\n<p><pre class=\"EnlighterJSRAW\" data-enlighter-language=\"\">public class JUnit4To5 {\n   @BeforeClass\n   public static void beforeClass() throws Exception {\n         System.out.println(&#34;JUnit4To5.beforeClass&#34;);\n   }\n\n   @Before\n   public void before() throws Exception {\n       System.out.println(&#34;JUnit4To5.before&#34;);\n   }\n\n   @Test\n   public void shouldMigrateASimpleTest() {\n       Assert.assertEquals(&#34;expected&#34;, &#34;expected&#34;);\n   }\n\n   @Test\n   @Ignore\n   public void shouldMigrateIgnoreTestToDisabledTest() {\n   }\n\n   @Test\n   public void shouldStillSupportHamcrestMatchers() {\n       assertThat(1, equalTo(1));\n   }\n\n   @Test\n   public void shouldStillSupportAssume() {\n       Assume.assumeTrue(javaVersion() &#62; 8);\n   }\n\n   @After\n   public void after() throws Exception {\n       System.out.println(&#34;JUnit4To5.after&#34;);\n   }\n\n   @AfterClass\n   public static void afterClass() throws Exception {\n       System.out.println(&#34;JUnit4To5.afterClass&#34;);\n   }\n\n   private int javaVersion() {\n       return 14;\n   }\n}</pre></p>\n<p>With this inspection turned on, JUnit 4 tests that are currently running using the JUnit 5 vintage engine are flagged to show you that they can be migrated.

The section on the left shows you the old JUnit 4 file. The changes from the refactor are shown on the right. The main change is that instead of importing org.junit, which is the JUnit 4 package, the class will import org.junit.jupiter, which is the JUnit 5 package structure.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/junit-local-history-imports.png\" alt=\"Junit Local History Input\" /></p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll see that the before and after annotation names have been changed to the new, more descriptive, ones: BeforeClass becomes BeforeAll, Before becomes BeforeEach.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/junit-local-history-before-class-1.png\" alt=\"Junit Local History Before\" /></p>\n<p>The test annotation doesn&#8217;t change, because the name is still the same. Changing the import means this will now use the new Test annotation. Assert statements now use methods on the Assertions class, instead of the old Assert.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/junit-local-history-test.png\" alt=\"Junit Local History Test\" /></p>\n<p>The JUnit 4 Ignore annotation has been replaced with the JUnit5 Disabled annotation.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/junit-local-history-test-ignore.png\" alt=\"JUnit Local History Test Ignore\" /></p>\n<p>Any tests that used Hamcrest matchers should still work as before.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/junit-local-history-hamcrest.png\" alt=\"JUnit Local History Hamcrest\" /></p>\n<p>JUnit4 <a href=\"https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/wiki/Assertions\" title=\"introduced the idea of assumptions\">introduced the idea of assumptions</a>, if these assumptions are met the test is run.

Like any IntelliJ IDEA refactoring, you can see the class still compiles after you’ve done the refactoring by using <strong>⌘F9</strong>, or <strong>CTRL</strong>+<strong>F9</strong>. Let&#8217;s use <strong>⌃⇧R</strong>, or <strong>CTRL</strong>+<strong>SHIFT</strong>+<strong>F10</strong> to run the tests to make sure everything behaves the way we expect.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/junit-run-test-results.png\" alt=\"JUnit Run Test Results\" /></p>\n<p>The beforeClass method is run once, each before and after method is run once per test, and the afterClass method is run once at the end, so the overall setup works as it did under JUnit 4. The  disabled test is still not run, and there are three passing tests, the same as before.</p>\n<h2>Automatically Migrate All Tests</h2>\n<p>Now we understand the individual steps to migrate a test, we can be a bit more ambitious with our migration. Let&#8217;s try to automatically migrate all our tests. Use Find Action with <strong>⌘⇧A</strong>, or <strong>Ctrl</strong>+<strong>Shift</strong>+<strong>A</strong>, and type Migrate, to see migration options for the code. IntelliJ IDEA offers the option to migrate the code from JUnit4 to JUnit5.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/junit-migrate-4-5-automatically.png\" alt=\"Junit Migrate 4 to 5\" /></p>\n<p>This migration is similar to what we did with the individual test class, but for all test classes. Press Run to see the refactoring preview. You can exclude specific classes or methods here using if you want to using <strong>⇧⌫</strong>, or <strong>Shift</strong>+<strong>Delete</strong>. Press Do Refactor to do the refactoring.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/junit-refactored-unit-tests.png\" alt=\"Junit Refactored Unit Tests\" /></p>\n<p>We want to check all our tests still work as before, so run them using <strong>⌃⇧R</strong>, or <strong>CTRL</strong>+<strong>SHIFT</strong>+<strong>F10</strong> as before. You can also right-click on the ‘tests’ folder and select Run ‘All Tests’. The Test Results window shows us the outcome of running the tests.</p>\n<p>Press the grey tick/check mark at the top-right to hide all the tests that passed and then press the icon next to that to hide all the tests that are disabled since these don’t need our attention or we don’t expect these to run respectively.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/junit-hide-passed-ignored.png\" alt=\"JUnit Hide Passed and Ignored Tests\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-samples/tree/80636d6a4d81a1c56e30457f9e4df5e6cb25397d\" title=\"After the migration\">After the migration</a>, you can see that the test classes have been changed. We can go through each of the files to check the changes before we commit them. <strong>⇧⌘]</strong>, or <strong>Ctrl</strong> +  <strong>Right Arrow</strong>, to move to the next file to compare so you can quickly check all the files. As these are mostly simple JUnit tests, most of the changes are a change to the imports to use the new JUnit Jupiter test annotation instead of the old JUnit test annotation.</p>\n<h2>Manual Migration for More Complex Cases</h2>\n<p>If the tests in the project are fairly straightforward ones, this automatic migration should take care of most of the tasks that need to happen. However, not all cases can be managed automatically. Migration from JUnit 4 to JUnit 5 could be a slow and steady process.</p>\n<p>At this point in our project, we have some tests fully migrated to JUnit 5, some partially migrated but using some JUnit 4 features, and potentially there may be some classic JUnit 4 (or even JUnit 3) tests running as they are. We&#8217;re running them all using JUnit 5, so we can write new tests using the new JUnit 5 features but keep existing stable tests as they are.</p>\n<p>However we might want to remove the dependency on the vintage engine to prevent ourselves from accidentally writing tests in the old style. If we <a href=\"https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-samples/blob/901b5f824e5ee2bbeb3f4b6eb213a237a70b4399/standard-java/pom.xml\" title=\"remove this dependency\">remove this dependency</a>, refresh the Maven changes and rebuild the project, we will be able to see which classes require the vintage engine, and therefore which tests need more help migrating to JUnit 5.</p>\n<p>One example of a change that we might do manually is to use the correct import for Hamcrest&#8217;s assertThat in the ExceptionStackTraceTest class, for example. We could do this by removing the reference to the JUnit Assert class, and getting IntelliJ IDEA to static import the Hamcrest MatcherAssert.assertThat. We can use optimise imports to remove the unnecessary JUnit 4 Assert import.</p>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-55173 size-full\" style=\"border: 1px solid #AAAAAA;\" src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/junit-manual-migration.png\" alt=\"AssertThat Refactor Example\" width=\"750\" height=\"300\" data-gif-src=\"https://resources.jetbrains.com/storage/products/blog/wp-content/uploads/junit-manual-migration.gif\" /></p>\n<p>You may discover that some tests are even JUnit 3 style tests, such as our NavigateToTestTest class. These tests extend a TestCase instead of using annotations.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screenshot-2020-07-30-11.17.05.png\" alt=\"Junit 3 Test Error\" /></p>\n<p>To address this, put the vintage dependency back in to the Maven POM file so that the project compiles again, and reload the maven changes. You can use <strong>⌥⏎</strong>, or <strong>Alt</strong>+<strong>Enter</strong>, on the class that is using a JUnit 3 test case. IntelliJ IDEA will suggest migrating to JUnit as a good first step.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/junit3-4-migration-intellij.png\" alt=\"Junit 3 Migration in IntelliJ\" /></p>\n<p>The test now uses annotations, and doesn&#8217;t import anything from the old junit.framework package. Now you can take the next step and migrate this test to JUnit5.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/junit4-5-migration-intelllij.png\" alt=\"Junit 4 to Migration IntelliJ\" /></p>\n<p>We might also want to do optimise imports to remove any old imports that aren&#8217;t needed. To do that, we can use a Find in Path search with <strong>⌃⇧F</strong>, or <strong>CTRL</strong>+<strong>SHIFT</strong>+<strong>F</strong>, and type org.junit. This will show up everything, including our new Jupiter classes. We could use an expression to capture that the next character after the dot needs to be an upper case letter so we need to type &#8216;org.junit.[A-Z]&#8217; and select Search with Regex and then match the case.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/junit-regex-search.png\" alt=\"Junit Regex Search\" /></p>\n<p>Now we can see all the remaining files that import a class from org.junit. There are lots of ways we could fix this, one option is to simply remove the old import, use the new JUnit 5 Assertions class, and add a static import for the assertEquals method so it can be used by all tests in the class.</p>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-55173 size-full\" style=\"border: 1px solid #AAAAAA;\" src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/manual-assert-equals.png\" alt=\"Manual JUnit Refactor\" width=\"750\" height=\"300\" data-gif-src=\"https://resources.jetbrains.com/storage/products/blog/wp-content/uploads/manual-assert-equals.gif\" /></p>\n<p>If your project has a number of these tests you can run this inspection alone on the whole codebase to automatically migrate all of those tests in one step.</p>\n<h2>Other Approaches to Consider</h2>\n<p>This specific problem, for example, can be fixed with an inspection. If we turn on &#8216;Obsolete assertions in JUnit 5 tests&#8217; we can get IntelliJ IDEA to suggest using the new JUnit 5 assertions. Now, when we go back to the editor, there is a warning on the old assert statement, and we can get IntelliJ IDEA to automatically use the new JUnit 5 Assertions instead. IntelliJ IDEA does have inspections and automatic fixes to help migrate code from JUnit 4 to JUnit 5, but if there isn&#8217;t a specific fix, we might take another approach such as a find and replace, or a <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/structural-search-and-replace.html\">Structural Search</a>, which might be more appropriate if there are a lot of files to change but the changes are all the same. We could use <a href=\"https://youtu.be/ffBeoE6NBSs\">live templates</a> for common code, and we could configure our auto import settings to make sure the new JUnit imports are suggested over the old ones. The right solution will depend upon what sort of changes need to be made and how many files are affected.</p>\n<h2>Final Steps</h2>\n<p>Now we&#8217;ve <a href=\"https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-samples/tree/901b5f824e5ee2bbeb3f4b6eb213a237a70b4399\" title=\"removed all references to JUnit 4 classes and functionality\">removed all references to JUnit 4 classes and functionality</a>, we can remove the vintage engine and use just the modern JUnit 5 test engine. You can load the Maven changes and rebuild the project. You should check the tests still work and pass, which you can do by pressing <strong>CTRL</strong> twice to bring up the run anything window. If we type &#8216;All&#8217; we can see the all tests run configuration and run all our project&#8217;s tests.</p>\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>We have successfully migrated all the tests in this project to JUnit 5. The first step was to migrate the project to run our JUnit 4 tests on the JUnit 5 platform. For many projects it may be enough to do this, and there may be no need to go all the way to removing the vintage engine. The most important thing is to be able to write and run tests in the new JUnit 5 style. We&#8217;ll cover the advantages of using JUnit 5 in another video.</p>\n<p>See also:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2017/11/intellij-idea-2017-3-junit-support/\"

href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/\">IntelliJ IDEA 2020.2</a> is packed with an amazing set of features, including more advanced support for GitHub pull requests, a new Inspections Widget that displays the number of warnings and errors in an opened file and allows you to quickly navigate between them, the Problems tool window that offers details of the issues in your current file and allows you to fix them fast, and the Related Problems inlay hint that notifies you when your changes break other files. There is also a bunch of new features for a number of frameworks and technologies including Jakarta EE, Quarkus, Micronaut, Amazon SQS API, and OpenAPI.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/blog_feat-6.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Java</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Java 15 will be out in September and IntelliJ IDEA 2020.2 is fully ready for it. We’ve updated our support for the <a href=\"http://cr.openjdk.java.net/~gbierman/records2/20200428/specs/records-jls.html\">Records</a> feature, which is now in its second preview, added basic support for <a href=\"https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/360\">Sealed Classes</a>, and provided full support for Text Blocks, which are a full-fledged feature in Java 15.</li>\n<li>If changes that you make to a Java method or field will cause errors in other files, the IDE will instantly notify you about that with an inlay hint. Click on this hint and the IDE will give you a list of the errors so you can fix them.</li>\n<li>If an exception happens while running your app, the IDE can use static analysis to find its root cause and pinpoint the exact statement that caused the exception. </li>\n<li>You can easily create inspections from structural searches, and specify a distinct description and severity for each of them.</li>\n<li>The Introducing Variable refactorings can now replace occurrences of a variable in intermediate scopes, as opposed to only replacing one or all occurrences.</li>\n<li>You can now start typing the Stream API method directly in a collection or array, and the IDE will suggest to automatically insert &#8216;.stream()&#8217; for you.</li>\n<li>Another Stream API improvement is that the IDE now suggests chained calls of expected type in the autocompletion.</li>\n<li>We’ve added a new action that can convert an optional chain to a chain of &#8216;if&#8217; statements.</li>\n<li>You can collapse several statements into a loop, and the ‘unroll loop’ intention action will now get the loop size from dataflow.</li>\n<li>Our data flow analysis can report non-trivial expressions that are known to evaluate to 0, and warns you about unnecessary comparisons where Math.min or Math.max is never bigger or smaller than another operand.</li>\n<li>We’ve grouped the Java live templates under the Java node in Settings/Preferences to make it easier for you to locate them among the live templates for all the other languages.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To learn more, visit the <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/whatsnew/#java\">Java</a> section of the What’s new page.</p>\n<p><strong>Editor</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>We’re pleased to introduce our brand new Inspections Widget, which displays the number of warnings and errors in the current file and allows you to easily navigate between them.</li>\n<li>There’s a new Problems tool window that shows the list of warnings and errors in the current file and gives you a description of those problems, and you can quickly fix them directly from the tool window.</li>\n<li>Preview the result of intention actions and quick-fixes before you actually apply them to your code.</li>\n<li>We’ve updated the background processes dialog to make it less visually cluttered.</li>\n<li>The UI of the status bar has been tidied up to look neater.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Find more details in the <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/whatsnew/#editor\">Editor section</a> of the What’s new page.</p>\n<p><strong>Version Control</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Now the entire GitHub pull request workflow can be done directly from IntelliJ IDEA.

You can also use the <strong>F2</strong> and <strong>⇧F2</strong> shortcuts, and then press <strong>Alt+Enter</strong> to see the available fixes.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/f2-2x-1.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>If code analysis is in progress, the icons are either replaced with the analysis progress text or dimmed out.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/states-2x.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Hover over the widget to see detailed information about the current state of the analysis process and about the problems that have been found.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/progress-2x.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>If you’re in the process of writing new code and warnings are not that important to you at the moment, you can change the highlighting level to Syntax. This way, warnings won’t distract you. To make this change, hover over the Inspections widget and use the link at the bottom of the popup to change the highlighting level to Syntax or None.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/popup-2x.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Just be sure to change the highlighting level back to All Problems when the time comes for you to polish your code.</p>\n<h2 id=\"related_problems\">Related problems</h2>\n<p>Starting from version 2020.2, IntelliJ IDEA shows problems that occur in other files as a result of changes made in the file you are currently working on.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve changed a non-private part of class API in some way – for example, by renaming a public field or updating the number of parameters in a package-private method signature – IntelliJ IDEA will analyze files related to that change and will notify you of any problems it finds with an inlay hint.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/related-problems-2x.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>You can click on the hint or use an action from the <strong>Alt+Enter</strong> menu to see the full list of related problems in the Find tool window. Currently, this feature works only for Java.</p>\n<h2 id=\"problems_tool_window\">Problems tool window</h2>\n<p>We’ve introduced a new Problems tool window. Click on the Inspections widget in the editor or use the <strong>Ctrl/Cmd+6</strong> shortcut to open it.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/current-file-2x-1.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>The Current File tab shows the list of problems in the file that is open in the editor. Select a problem and press <strong>Enter</strong> or double-click to navigate to it. You can also open a preview right in the tool window, and you can use the eye icon to filter the problems by type and to change the sorting.</p>\n<p>The light bulb icon on the toolbar turns on if there are quick fixes for the selected problem. You can also press <strong>Alt+Enter</strong> on a problem to see the list of available quick fixes.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/altenter-2x-1.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"what_s_next\">What’s next</h2>\n<p>Our plans don’t end here. With v2020.3, we will continue to make it working with errors in IntelliJ IDEA easier. We are going to add the Project Errors tab to the Problems tool window. This tab will display the errors detected by the IDE for open files and dependent files. To get a full list of problems for the whole project, you will still need to <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/compiling-applications.html#compile_module\">build the project</a> or use the <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/running-inspections.html#run-all-inspections\">Inspect Code</a> action.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/project-errors-2x-1.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Upgrade to IntelliJ IDEA 2020.2 if you haven&#8217;t already and try all those new features.
