I’ve been a user of their <span class=\"caps\">RPM</span> product for a while now and recommend it to all my clients, so when they offered to sponsor the site I was happy to accept. In addition to the product, they also have some interesting stuff on their performance focussed site <a href=\"http://railslab.newrelic.com\">RailsLab</a> site. I don’t intend to talk about anything related to their products or services here, but in case I secretly turn into a shill, this counts as full disclosure.</p> \n<h3>Comments Policy</h3> \n<p>A few comments have been less-than-friendly to either myself, or other commenters. So my new comment policy is <strong>Be civil</strong>. Feel free to disagree with any posts or comments here, but do so civilly. Anything which violates this new policy will just be deleted without comment. However life’s too short to spend time moderating comments, so let’s all just be nice.</p> \n<h3> Action Rails</h3> \n<p>I’ve teamed up with Pratik Naik and Mike Gunderloy to form Action Rails. We provide a number of services which could be of interest to readers here. If you want your application’s code and architecture reviewed by a team of experts, ongoing support for your development team or help with a one-off specific problem we can help.
