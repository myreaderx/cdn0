Every chef has their own technique which requires a fair amount of expertise. Some do it in a microwave, some swirl the water before they put the egg in, and some use tea strainers or cups to introduce the cracked egg to boiling water&#8230; and while each chef has their own poaching lifehack, none are as easy (and easy-looking) as using OTOTO&#8217;s Eggland poacher. Designed as a pool-tube that floats in water, this food-grade silicone device makes poaching eggs absolutely stress-free. Just place the Eggland in almost-boiling water, add a few drops of oil, and crack the egg right into its cavity. The egg looks like it&#8217;s lounging away, while the hot water below it cooks it to oozy-yolk perfection. Pull the device out by the handle that&#8217;s modeled after an inflatable palm tree, and flip the egg over your ham and cheese sandwich to upgrade it to an absolutely divine Croque Madame sandwich. Now THAT&#8217;s what I call a breakfast of champions!</p>\n<p>Designers: Lilach Eytan &#038; <a href=\"https://www.ototodesign.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">OTOTO</a></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/UYIYQYh.gif\" width=\"1050\" height=\"591\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/auto-draft/eggland_ototo_2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-274584\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/auto-draft/eggland_ototo_3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-274585\" /></p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/yankodesign?a=8WST6wdSzZY:x7VwKWzxWj0:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/yankodesign?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/yankodesign?a=8WST6wdSzZY:x7VwKWzxWj0:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/yankodesign?i=8WST6wdSzZY:x7VwKWzxWj0:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/yankodesign?a=8WST6wdSzZY:x7VwKWzxWj0:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/yankodesign?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/yankodesign?a=8WST6wdSzZY:x7VwKWzxWj0:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/yankodesign?i=8WST6wdSzZY:x7VwKWzxWj0:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/yankodesign?a=8WST6wdSzZY:x7VwKWzxWj0:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/yankodesign?i=8WST6wdSzZY:x7VwKWzxWj0:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/yankodesign?a=8WST6wdSzZY:x7VwKWzxWj0:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/yankodesign?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/yankodesign/~4/8WST6wdSzZY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 21 Aug 2020 21:50:02 +0000","feedId":64,"bgimg":"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/auto-draft/eggland_ototo_1.jpg","linkMd5":"206d3a017ad8b1973a771213dbe46a31","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn95@2020_1/2020/08/22/17-15-13-130_5f669cba22d44152.webp","destWidth":1050,"destHeight":709,"sourceBytes":157603,"destBytes":80984,"author":"Sarang Sheth","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/auto-draft/eggland_ototo_1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn95@2020_1/2020/08/22/17-15-13-130_5f669cba22d44152.webp","https://i.imgur.com/UYIYQYh.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn64@2020_6/2020/08/22/17-15-36-526_86c52e19feaeba5d.webp","https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/auto-draft/eggland_ototo_2.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn45@2020_3/2020/08/22/17-15-14-922_f617277f6d1e8222.webp","https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/auto-draft/eggland_ototo_3.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn42@2020_3/2020/08/22/17-15-14-871_9ccaf35be123e767.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/yankodesign?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn43@2020_6/2020/08/22/17-15-16-815_be70ddf18521ce99.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/yankodesign?i=8WST6wdSzZY:x7VwKWzxWj0:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn63@2020_6/2020/08/22/17-15-14-894_844d1f446fbe6233.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/yankodesign?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn27@2020_6/2020/08/22/17-15-14-863_a7bab000502b2c11.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/yankodesign?i=8WST6wdSzZY:x7VwKWzxWj0:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn97@2020_4/2020/08/22/17-15-14-883_706845557f227eac.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/yankodesign?i=8WST6wdSzZY:x7VwKWzxWj0:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn81@2020_4/2020/08/22/17-15-14-934_951f31a0dbf368ce.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/yankodesign?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn56@2020_2/2020/08/22/17-15-15-890_19238f9c81aa1a56.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/yankodesign/~4/8WST6wdSzZY":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn11@2020_5/2020/08/22/17-15-16-278_27f73176c7527a5e.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598116512899},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 01:15:12","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 01:15:12","title":"Apple should have made Beats truly wireless earphones really long back…","link":"https://www.yankodesign.com/?p=274201","description":"<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/auto-draft/beats_minipods_1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-274202\" /></p>\n<p>Remember Beats by Dre? Apple acquired them in 2014 and it&#8217;s been radio silence ever since. Apple did however launch a few Beats products just to keep the buzz going, but nothing really matched up to the excitement around the AirPods. Now I&#8217;m not really sure whether Apple bought Beats to throttle their success (so the AirPods wouldn&#8217;t have any competition), or whether they bought Beats just because they saw it as a nice brand to own, but it&#8217;s safe to assume that the Beats brand isn&#8217;t once what it used to be. Lew from Unbox Therapy even <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvta8weC-6Q\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">has a theory</a> that Apple&#8217;s slowly phasing the brand out completely.</p>\n<p>In an alternate universe where Apple wasn&#8217;t so anti-competitive, these Beats miniPods would surely be a popular hit. Modeled to look sort of like the Google Pixel Buds, the Beats miniPods are the conceptual creation of 14-year old Nicola Morelli who found herself with extra time on her hands during the lockdown. The TWS earbuds come with the iconic Beats logo on them, and fit snugly into the ear using silicone tips. I assume the driver technology on the inside would match up to the Beats standards, and have some form of noise-canceling too, but that&#8217;s something we can only dream of at this point of time. The miniPods, however, do come with touch-sensitivity, allowing you to tap to answer and reject calls, control playback, and adjust the volume. Like all TWS earbuds, the miniPods have their own nifty charging-case too, and this one even boasts of a clear-top design that allows you to see the earbuds when they&#8217;re inside the case. Pretty nice, eh? If I was only half as talented when I was a 14-year old.</p>\n<p>Designer: Nicola Morelli</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/auto-draft/beats_minipods_2.jpg\"

a good roast but also a <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/tag/coffee-grinder/\">good grind</a>. Every coffee machine uses a different type of grind &#8211; espresso machines that give you lattes and cappuccinos use a fine grind while a drip coffee maker or french press will use a coarse grind. The wrong grind will give you a complete failure and it won’t be coffee, it&#8217;ll just be hot bean water and we don&#8217;t want that. So how can we take the guesswork out of grinding beans and not ruin our specialty roasts? Simple &#8211; just get the Ode grinder!</p>\n<p>Ode is a powerful and precise home grinder with professional cafe grade capabilities. It was designed so that you can enjoy a perfect cup of coffee every single day no matter what brewing process you choose &#8211; pour-over, french press, cold brew, espressos, or drip! This coffee grinder is probably the only one you will ever need because it comes with 31 grind settings and a distinctive single dose load bin for maximum bean freshness. And unlike the big cafe machines, this little appliance does everything quietly. Fellow and Branch wanted to create a grinder that also looked like an appliance worthy of sitting on your countertop. The all-black grinder looks like a sleek espresso machine in itself with a large intuitive dial that allows you to easily choose the type of grind you want. I also love the magnetic base so the container will not move out of place and no coffee will be wasted!</p>\n<p>Fellow has some of the best coffee accessories in the game and a grinder was a necessity for their range but, they wanted to do it right and make something that actually would make a difference to your coffee without requiring you to be an expert. &#8220;We were also tired of affordable grinders claiming they could do &#8216;everything&#8217;. But when push comes to shove, these grinders were good at brewed coffee but less than mediocre at espresso (or vice versa). After 26 months of user research, prototyping, and lab testing Ode Brew Grinder was born,&#8221; says the team. Ode makes it possible to have consistent quality and precision with your ground beans and is versatile enough to work with any brewing process. It is truly an <em>ode </em>to coffee grinders!</p>\n<p>Designer: Branch Creative for Fellow Products</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://fellowproducts.com/products/ode-brew-grinder\" target=\"_blank\"

width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></p>\n<p>In the top floor suite of hotel ‘sequence | Miyashita Park’ in Shibuya, Tokyo, you will find a marvelous piece of equipment quietly sitting on the ledge overlooking the scenic metropolis it is named after. Called #001 TOKYO, it is a vacuum tube amplifier, the first one by Puddle Sound &#8211; a brand created by Japanese architectural studio, Puddle. However, what they are offering is not just a product but a completely new experience of the Tokyo soundscape to immerse yourself in.</p>\n<p>Puddle Sound’s vision is to make people more conscious of how they associate sound from a place and time as a specific memory in their lives. And they do this by bringing together three things: a modern Tokyo-style guest room design, original sound recorded around Shibuya, and the integrity of the tube amplifier as art. Thus was born #001 TOKYO. It is a custom-made amplifier, one of only 15 limited-edition models, which comes with an architectural acoustic design for your space to bring sound, art, and life together.</p>\n<p>Designer Masaki Kato, the founder of Puddle, wanted to use various primitive materials to take the audience on a journey of a novel sensory experience. Securely placed within a glass housing are the vacuum tubes alongside a circular heatsink made up of 400 copper cooling pins. Surrounding them is natural clay, coated over the steel casing, and is given a rough texture to give an appearance of a desert landscape to this piece. On the lower part, which is recessed than the rest of the body, we see control elements and connectivity ports nicely laid out with ambient light shining upon them, making this design an embodiment of Japanese minimalism in perfect harmony.</p>\n<p>Puddle Sound has collaborated with various artisans who bring their amazing craftsmanship from their respective fields to create this wonderful work of art. Now if only there was a portable version, allowing you to carry a small piece of Tokyo wherever you go.</p>\n<p>Designer: Masaki Kato for <a href=\"http://puddlesound.com/\" target=\"_blank\"

/></p>\n<p>After months of quarantine, all I need is space &#8211; space at home, open space, and I would also be okay with the NASA kind of space. You get the point and the puns. Siri has seemed to pick up on it as well and I came across this cool space-themed watch by UNDONE. The brand has always shown a penchant for space, in fact, their SpaceXplorer watch pays homage to the 2014 SpaceX Dragon V2 spacecraft. It is a limited-edition timepiece that celebrates achievements that we have made in terms of design, technology, and innovation. Funny, we do the same at Yanko Design every day too!</p>\n<p>This special watch pays great attention to detail and you will recognize those little things instantly if you are a space nerd. For instance, it features styling elements from the new SpaceX ultra-modern space suits. Then it takes it up a notch by using the Dragon V2 capsule’s design details &#8211; the grey dial ring, white indices, and the unique hands which are modeled off of the capsules white oblong shaped indices and windows. &#8220;The minute-hand mimics the path of a gravitational slingshot, and the second-hand is actually a white disc on which a dot rotates to mimic the moon’s movement around the earth. The hour hand continues to nod to the design of the new and improved spacesuit, highlighting the shape and lines of the collar,&#8221; says UNDONE. And because space is an infinite black expanse, the watch dial glows in a cool nitrous blue when its dark.</p>\n<p>Just like the spacesuits, the watch will be hermetically sealed to withstand up to five atmospheres. The case back’s circular pattern symbolizes the landing pad of the SpaceX autonomous drone ship and what truly stole my heart about this watch was the engraved &#8220;Of Course I Still Love You&#8221; quote that was Elon Musk&#8217;s tribute to the AI that commanded spaceships in a science fiction novel by Iain M. Banks. &#8220;We’ve added the launch time, date, and coordinates (Kennedy Space Center, Cape Canaveral) and to make this really special, we also added return date,&#8221; says the team. Only 300 pieces of this SpaceXplorer watch will be made and they all pay homage to the two astronauts’ historic journey to the International Space Station and the first-ever successful launch of a crewed orbital spacecraft by a private company. It&#8217;s a Musk-have!</p>\n<p>Designer: Undone</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.undone.com/en/collaboration/spacexplorer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Click Here to Buy

Let me give you a hint &#8211; it involves the sea, the sun, and some serious labor. Sea salt harvesting for the most part lets the sun do the job and once the water has dried up, salt crystals are harvested. And this age-old process is still practiced today. But don’t worry you no longer need to step out of your house to experience the precious moment of witnessing salt formation. Croatian firm BOIR brings this experience right to your home!</p>\n<p>Their product, aptly named ‘SALT’, is more than just a salt container. It is a portable saltworks whose aim is to preserve the authentic taste of natural Mediterranean Sea salt which is extremely rich with minerals and oligo-elements – about 80 of them. ‘SALT’ comes with a bottle of &#8211; Nin 28 Bé° &#8211; which is concentrated Adriatic seawater (brine). All you have to do is pour a thin layer of this brine into the salt pan and expose it to sunlight for an hour or heat it up in the oven. When the crystal pattern appears, it can be harvested with a mini rake and is ready to be served fresh!</p>\n<p>‘SALT’ comes in two variants – Natural and Dark. The former comes in a base of natural walnut with an oil finish and the latter, in oak with a dark oil finish. Both come with a ceramic salt pan coated in waterproof enamel, a mini hand-polished inox salt rake, and the aforementioned brine in a bottle of amber glass. BOIR intends to add various brines from different micro-regions to their collection of offerings. On a different note, I must say I’m absolutely in love with the logo of ‘SALT’. The clever depiction of the ‘T’ as a salt rake is just superb!</p>\n<p>This product is also an homage to the traditional and sustainable practices of sea salt harvesting that are increasingly being pushed out by industrial production processes, which they say whiten the salt just to please the eye. The disappearance of traditional saltworks threatens biodiversity and also the rich culinary culture of the Mediterranean. With ‘SALT’ they hope to mimic the human element of salt creation and I for one am in complete awe of this peaceful dining ritual!</p>\n<p>Designers: Vlatka Leskovar &#8211; Zidar and Ivan Zidar of <a

scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s see if I can get through this entire write-up without making a &#8216;cold feet&#8217; joke.</p>\n<p>The Scooter One is a reinterpretation of the classic sneaker. While there&#8217;s nothing really wrong with classic sneakers (that&#8217;s why they&#8217;re called classics), they could use an update in terms of how efficiently they&#8217;re made, how long they last, and what their impact is on the environment. Designed out of sustainably sourced materials that have a net positive impact on the environment, the Scooter One embodies the iconic style of the classic pair of sneakers, but also comes with a few features that set it apart.</p>\n<p>Its monotone, minimalist, easy-on-the-eyes design is made with a proprietary Prime Fiber Leather that upcycles scrap leather and vegan leather to create a better, looking, less wasteful, and more durable alternative. Prime Fiber Leather utilizes existing scrap pieces of leather left behind from cutting leather sheets, requires very minimal processing, and keeps waste material out of landfills. It’s also lighter and stronger than traditional leather, as well as waterproof and scratch-resistant!</p>\n<p>On the inside, the Scooter One comes with what the designers call their Soufflé Fit Technology<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"™\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" />, which results in a cushioned and comfortable fit for every foot. The inner lining is crafted from a proprietary blend of Merino Wool and Tencel &#8211; an eucalyptus-based fiber. This blended fabric is soft to the touch, moisture-wicking, breathable, and even regulates the temperature of your feet, keeping it cool when you perspire.</p>\n<p>The Scooter One’s soles are a mix of 90% natural rubber and 10% recycled rubber. Designed to have a dual-density, the outsoles provide excellent shock absorption along with durability and traction. Whether you’re sitting in a café, going for a jog, sprinting to catch the subway, or just walking on uneven terrain, the Scooter One’s soles mold to your every move, and help give you the grip you need.</p>\n<p>Designed with a combination of all-natural, recycled, and sustainable materials, the Scooter One have a significantly smaller impact on the environment. The laces are made entirely out of cotton, the dyes used to tan the leather are eco-friendly too, and the sneakers’ proprietary leather is solvent-free and certified by GRS (Global Recycled Standard). The inner lining and insole are all-natural too, made from wool and wood-pulp to provide a comfortable fit that’s breathable, helps wick out moisture/perspiration, and keeps those feet of yours breezy cool!</p>\n<p>Designer: Projext &#38; Co.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://YD.go2.fund/scooterone\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Click Here to Buy Now: $89</strong></a> <del datetime=\"2020-08-20T02:54:55+00:00\">$129</del> (31% off).

We always hear about the rent situation in New York and Los Angeles, but even if you cross the border you&#8217;ll find that Vancouver and Toronto also fall under that bracket. Those two cities are the hub for young working professionals in Canada and it is crucial to provide affordable housing options that are sustainable and fit with their flexible lifestyle. Turns out there is an architectural concept, Shifting Nests, designed to solve this exact problem.</p>\n<p>While Vancouver has quickly become one of the most expensive cities to live in, it is not densely populated and there are a lot of vacant spaces that can be put to better use &#8211; Shifting Nests sustainable tiny homes is that use! This project wants to transform empty parking lots into a community with gardens and low-cost homes. &#8220;The &#8216;nests&#8217; are a prefabricated housing solution consisting of plywood, metal cladding, and corrugated polycarbonate on a series of simple frames. The jury was impressed by the sensible linear plan layout, segmented into zones for resting, bathing, cooking, living, dining, and farming,&#8221; explains the team,</p>\n<p>Shifting Nests won the first prize in the Bee Breeders 2019 Mircohome competition for its futuristic approach to affordable housing that took the environment into account. The structures almost look like a hybrid between an RV and a bunker, I wish it looked a little cozier. While many details are still being worked out, it would be nice to see what sustainable housing solutions are incorporated &#8211; solar panels, furniture made with recycled material, self-sustaining garden for community produce? Micro living is probably the future of future generations so having designs that make life easier for them economically while also helping the climate crisis is crucial.</p>\n<p>Designer: BLA Design

goals","link":"https://www.yankodesign.com/?p=274390","description":"<p><iframe title=\"Ghost Pacer: Your Personal Holographic Workout Partner\" src=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/711258243/ghost-pacer-your-personal-holographic-workout-partner/widget/video.html\" height=\"590.625\" width=\"1050\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Think of the Ghost Pacer as your own personal carrot on a stick. Nothing makes a person more competitive than seeing that they&#8217;re actually losing to a competitor. It&#8217;s why multiplayer games are infinitely more fun and fast-paced than solo gaming. The Ghost Pacer brings a similar sort of competitive-ness to the act of solo-jogging.</p>\n<p>Designed as a pair of AR glasses you wear while running, the Ghost Pacer analyzes your running route and sets you up against a virtual runner who pushes your competitive spirit. The Ghost Pacer comes with an app that you feed your running route into, along with a time limit you want to achieve. It then uses that data to project a life-size runner who runs right beside you, often overtaking you in an effort to make you run faster. Seeing the projection running ahead motivates you to run faster than you would if you were on your own.</p>\n<p>The 3D avatar built into the Ghost Pacer works on a pretty realistic model of a real-life runner. The avatar uses your phone&#8217;s GPS along with a proprietary IMU to make the runner behave in a natural fashion, leaning sideways as it makes a turn and even running slower when it&#8217;s going up or down an incline. It captures your own running data too, which not only helps the Ghost Pacer get better with time, but it also allows you to compete with yourself by running against any of your past laps. The app pools in data from all Ghost Pacer users, even creating a virtual scoreboard, so you could compete with real runners who go on the same route as you&#8230; or run against your friends by programming the virtual runner to emulate any of their previous runs!</p>\n<p>On the hardware front, the Ghost Pacer is a relatively light piece of tech, weighing a mere 90 grams (3 ounces). It&#8217;s big enough to fit on your face even if you&#8217;re wearing spectacles, and the closed visor design gives you a larger field of view, allowing you to see the virtual runner out of the corner of your eye. The device comes with a 6-hour battery too, so you could even use the Ghost Pacer to train for marathons and longer runs. While the hardware&#8217;s pretty capable, the secret sauce lies entirely in the app, which does a pretty remarkable job of tracking your movement and accurately placing the runner in relation to where you are&#8230; WHILE both of you are moving forward. The Ghost Pacer currently works only for runs, but I imagine it would just take a software update to allow the virtual avatar to coach you into doing better pushups or yoga, dancing better, or engaging in a variety of competitive cardio exercises.

serious problem for our planet. We need more designs that do not end up in our landfills or oceans just to stay there for hundreds of years. Rising up to this challenge are designers Cristina Regidor and Arturo Moreno with the idea of reducing wastage for products like toys, whose life cycles are comparatively shorter. They have created ‘Long Animals’, toys made out of wood that last for a long time and are also well&#8230; quite literally long. They went a step further by creating the packaging in wood too. Their entire design (toy + packaging) is environmentally friendly. No plastic. Not even glue! Now that’s some impactful concept!</p>\n<p>The toys, featuring a dog and a croc, come as blocks and use dowel pins for assembly. These pins are used to assemble the packaging as well. And all the instructions come engraved on the outer panel. Also, to reduce waste, the inner piece of the packaging that protects the blocks is made of wood residues mixed with the fungus Pleurotus Ostreatus. The mixture is inserted into a mold to grow mycelium, creating a light and ecological protective structure. The designers have definitely rounded up this design well! Kids can now have fun and help save the planet at the same time!</p>\n<p>Designers: Cristina Regidor and Arturo Moreno</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-274513\"
