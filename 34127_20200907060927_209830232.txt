The High Energy Tagger (HET) counting rate is dominated by radiative\r\nBhabha scattering events without any associated signal in the KLOE detector. By comparison with the\r\nKLOE luminosity measurement, the radiative Bhabha cross section per scintillator can be measured, in\r\norder to monitor detector performance and infer acceptance × efficiency of the HET. The π 0\r\nproduction from two-photon fusion is tagged by requiring the coincidence between the HET and the\r\nKLOE detectors wh...","descriptionType":"text/plain","publishedDate":"Thu, 03 Sep 2020 23:00:00 +0000","feedId":34127,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"5c44ce7fb8b67624eb132fb1e8a1d1bb","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"F.
