strategy for the owners, and a sculptural response to the landscape and garden. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As contradictory as these objectives may seem, Kyneton House achieves both, by designing a step-free extension within a striking cantilevered form.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Simply speaking, the architects have created an elevated extension containing the main bedroom, and a new carport underneath. An elevator connects to the main level of the existing 1977 house designed by </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">architect Ken Robinson, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">as well as the new bedroom suite, eliminating the need for stairs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not only does the elevated form of the extension allow space underneath for the new carport, it respects the clients’ beloved garden.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8216;They have spent a lot of effort in making the most of the original 1977 home, and as they are both very keen gardeners, have really taken on the substantial gardens as an ongoing project that they continue to work on and improve,&#8217;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> says </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Antony.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> ‘Their affection for their home really was the genesis of the project, as they wanted to create an addition that also ensured their long term enjoyment of the house well into the future.’</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The use of simple black bars on the extension evokes the metal sculptures of Tony Smith and Anthony Caro, with cladding that provides a recessive backdrop to the surrounding greenery. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Internally, the clients requested rich, natural materials to evoke a gallery experience. An extensive use of timber panels creates a calming and dramatic interior as a backdrop for their art collection, while tying with the original material palette encompassing bricks and ceiling lining boards from demolished local houses. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The completed project has extended and elevated this interesting home, both literally and figuratively, to support the clients well into the future!</span></p>\n</div>\n\n                                    </div>\n\n
