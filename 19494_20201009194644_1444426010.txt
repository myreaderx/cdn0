There’s more information about government cloud availability later in this post. Tasks in Teams lets you manage your team tasks from Planner and individual tasks from To Do in your hub for teamwork.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>This announcement also moves us to the next stage in our naming sequence, where the app name in Teams changes to <STRONG>Tasks by Planner and To Do</STRONG> in desktop and <STRONG>Tasks</STRONG> in mobile. We will make this change over a weekend to reduce the likelihood of users seeing different names as the name change rolls out, and we expect to make the change by the end of October. We will make an update to our Message Center post when we kick off this change.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><span class=\"lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline\" image-alt=\"namingsequence_ga.png\" style=\"width: 999px;\"><img src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/223943i043CCB52FC34FCBB/image-size/large?v=1.0&amp;px=999\" role=\"button\" title=\"namingsequence_ga.png\" alt=\"namingsequence_ga.png\" /></span></P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>Our team has been working on Tasks in Teams around the clock since we <A href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/planner-blog/announcing-tasks-in-teams-a-coherent-task-management-experience/ba-p/969386\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">first announced it</A> at Microsoft Ignite 2019—and we couldn’t be more excited to bring it to all our users. Tasks in Teams brings together your team plans and individual tasks into one, collaborative space alongside all your chats, meetings, and files. Task management in the app replicates familiar tools and design from Planner and To Do, so there’s almost nothing new to learn. You can learn more about Tasks in Teams from <A href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/office/e32639f3-2e07-4b62-9a8c-fd706c12c070\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">our support page</A> and <A href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/planner-blog/announcing-tasks-in-microsoft-teams-public-rollout/ba-p/1502225\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">public rollout blog post</A>.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>We're also excited to report that Tasks in Teams for the Teams mobile app will soon begin rolling out to all users in non-government clouds and is scheduled to be completed in November.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><span class=\"lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center\" image-alt=\"tasksinteams_mobile.png\" style=\"width: 400px;\"><img src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/223944i7682C1623CBCB783/image-size/medium?v=1.0&amp;px=400\" role=\"button\" title=\"tasksinteams_mobile.png\" alt=\"tasksinteams_mobile.png\" /></span></P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>When the Tasks app becomes available on your iOS or Android device, you can find it within the <STRONG>More</STRONG> (…) option at the bottom of the Teams mobile app interface. There’s nothing to download; Tasks will automatically appear in that menu. The Tasks app for Teams mobile is limited to the List view.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>We’re also working to make Tasks in Teams available for our government cloud offerings, with GCC going live in the coming months. GCC High and DoD will follow after that. We’ll keep you posted about those releases and any initial limitations soon.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>In other news, we <A href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/video-hub/get-more-done-with-microsoft-planner/m-p/1681252\" target=\"_blank\">announced at Ignite</A> that you will soon be able to create tasks from Teams chats or channel conversations.&nbsp;This capability is one of the top requests from our users, so we’re excited to bring this to you soon.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><span class=\"lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center\" image-alt=\"CreateTask (1).gif\" style=\"width: 999px;\"><img src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/225512iB1151424DE0B812F/image-size/large?v=1.0&amp;px=999\" role=\"button\" title=\"CreateTask (1).gif\" alt=\"CreateTask (1).gif\" /></span></P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>This is just the beginning of an exciting few months, so keep checking our <A href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/planner-blog/bg-p/PlannerBlog\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tech Community Blogs</A> site for all the latest news.
