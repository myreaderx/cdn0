This article was originally published in January 2014.</em></p>\n<p>When I was a young man, I would scoff at well-intentioned adults who would sometimes offer up little aphorisms when I got in trouble or had a problem. Little nuggets like, “This too shall pass,” generally went in one ear and out the other. They sounded too simple and too cliché to really mean anything.</p>\n<p>But as I’ve become a grown man, I’ve had experiences where these little bits of wisdom have come back to me and have revealed their value and deeper truth. I’ve come to really agree with the poet and philosopher Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who argued that “The largest and worthiest portion of our knowledge consists of aphorisms.”</p>\n<p>An aphorism is a short, pithy statement that conveys a principle or contains a pearl of wisdom. Part of what makes them so powerful is that they can stand on their own without context; as the philologist Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel put it, “An aphorism ought to be entirely isolated from the surrounding world like a little work of art and complete in itself like a hedgehog.”</p>\n<p>Philosopher Nassim Nicholas Talib argues that an aphorism’s ability “to compress powerful ideas in a handful of words” shows bravado. This may be why, he notes, “the Arabic word for an improvised one-liner is ‘act of manliness.’”</p>\n<p>These “acts of manliness” communicate timeless truths that have been around for ages. But the fact that aphorisms are so old and common makes them easy to dismiss, the way I did as a young man.</p>\n<p>As a culture we want things that seem new, revolutionary, complex, and smart; we want the cool hacks and “secrets” that haven’t been discovered until now. But, as author David Foster Wallace has noted, although these “clichés” may seem “lame and unexciting on the surface,” they actually express great, incredibly relevant truths; no matter how much society has changed, following classic, simple principles is still the pathway to a good, meaningful life. So we would advise everyone (including ourselves) to heed Wallace’s additional words while perusing the aphorisms below: “Bracket for just a few minutes your skepticism about the value of the totally obvious.” The more you meditate on these words, the more wisdom they’ll reveal to you.</p>\n<p>Even when something seems obvious, “The whole trick is keeping the truth up front in daily consciousness.” So consider making one of these images your laptop’s screensaver or your phone’s lock screen.</p>\n<p><img style=\" display: block;

Genetics, personality, upbringing, a simple lack of confidence. But its real root is typically overlooked. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The shy are self-centered.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, that may seem harsh, but, it’s literally true.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you’re suffering from shyness, you’re focused on yourself, on how </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">you’re </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">feeling. All you’re thinking about is: How am </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">doing? Did </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> say the wrong thing? Do they like </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">me</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What you’re not thinking about, at all, is the other person. What you’re not thinking is: Are</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> they</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> having fun? Is </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">he</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> feeling good? Is </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">she</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> comfortable?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To be self-conscious, is to only be conscious . . . of the self.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More extroverted, socially-assured types are beset with a different, yet similarly sourced, problem.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They don’t feel anxious when interacting with others, but aren’t always successful in building relationships with them either, in part because they don’t remember things — stories, preferences, birthdays — even after being told multiple times. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Sorry,” you’ll say, “I have a bad memory.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But you don’t have a bad memory. You’re self-absorbed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Again, seemingly harsh, yet literally true. You don’t hear what the other person is saying, because you’re not truly listening to them. You’re thinking about what</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> you</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> want to say whenever they’re done speaking. You’re thinking about whatever is going on in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">your </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">life. If what the other person shares doesn’t seem to directly relate to that, you don’t put in the effort to file it away. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether we’re being shy-and-self-centered or socially-assured-and-self-absorbed (and most of us can be both, depending on the circumstances) the solution to these issues and all issues of human interaction is the same. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Connecting with another requires temporarily directing a bit of the spotlight we like to exclusively shine inwards, onto another. And giving that attention to someone else, requires getting over your self. </span></p>\n<div id=\"pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg\"></div>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/sunday-firesides-want-to-solve-your-social-problems-get-over-your-self/\">Sunday Firesides: Want to Solve Your Social Problems?

We begin with why it’s so easy to get caught up in the consumerism-driven “cult of clutter,” how the clutter it generates extends far past a person’s tangible stuff, and the cost it exacts from our lives in both financial and psychological terms. Gary then explains how to simplify and declutter every aspect of your life — the material, of course, but also the technological, informational, and even social. Along the way, this self-described “redneck hippie” offers no-nonsense advice that refreshingly departs from the kind of soft glow, artfully arranged, white background pictures of minimalism you might find on Instagram. Because Gary’s not on Instagram.
