His name is Billy Baker and he’s a journalist and the author of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1982111089/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=1982111089&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess&#38;linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\"><em>We Need to Hang Out: A Memoir of Making Friends</em></a>. Billy and I begin our conversation with the problem of male loneliness in the modern age, and how it befell him in his own life. We then discuss how men and women do friendships differently, the way men do theirs shoulder to shoulder, what this means for what male friendships need to be built around, and why they require what he calls “velvet hooks.” Billy shares how he started his project, which experimented with different ways to recover and create connections, by rekindling his old friendships, but why that ultimately didn’t scratch the friendship itch for him. Billy then describes what did: a kind of casual fraternity for middle-aged men he started, and how it was inspired by something called the “men’s shed” movement in Australia and its philosophy that men need “somewhere to go, something to do, and someone to talk to.” We end our conversation with Billy’s takeaways for making friends in adulthood, including the need for embracing intentionality and social risk.</p>\n<p><em>If reading this in an email, click the title of the post to listen to the show.</em></p>\n<h3>Show Highlights</h3>\n<ul><li>Why are men so susceptible to loneliness?</li>\n<li>What are the health consequences of loneliness?</li>\n<li>Face to face versus shoulder to shoulder </li>\n<li>What are “velvet hooks”?</li>\n<li>Why re-kindling past friendships didn’t fully scratch the friendship itch </li>\n<li>Why the Men’s Shed Movement inspired Billy to make some actual friends </li>\n<li>How COVID managed to strengthen friendships </li>\n<li>The pressure of trying to be friends with both halves of a couple </li>\n<li>What’s the actionable takeaway here for guys?</li>\n</ul><h3>Resources/Articles/People Mentioned in Podcast</h3>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/male-loneliness/\">The Hidden Tragedy of Male Loneliness</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/connection-in-a-lonely-world-vivek-murthy/\">Finding Connection in a Lonely World</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/the-best-way-to-make-and-keep-friendships-in-adulthood/\">The Best Way to Make and Keep Friendships in Adulthood</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/podcast-567-understanding-the-wonderful-frustrating-dynamic-of-friendship/\">Understanding the Wonderful, Frustrating Dynamic of Friendship</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/understanding-male-friendships/\">Understanding Male Friendships</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-make-friends/\">Making and Keeping Friendships</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/the-history-and-nature-of-man-friendships/\">The History and Nature of Male Friendships</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/bosom-buddies-a-photo-history-of-male-affection/\">Bosom Buddies: A Photo History of Male Affection</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/podcast-274-building-band-brothers/\">Building Your Band of Brothers</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&#38;rct=j&#38;q=&#38;esrc=s&#38;source=web&#38;cd=&#38;cad=rja&#38;uact=8&#38;ved=2ahUKEwiqqpfgx4_wAhXGu54KHX9aC0IQFjAAegQICBAD&#38;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fmagazine%2F2017%2F03%2F09%2Fthe-biggest-threat-facing-middle-age-men-isn-smoking-obesity-loneliness%2Fk6saC9FnnHQCUbf5mJ8okL%2Fstory.html&#38;usg=AOvVaw1C410cDTBwyuiYuH4zHbJD\">“The Biggest Threat Facing Middle-Aged Men”</a> — Billy’s original article that went viral </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/manvotional-the-joys-and-difficulties-of-making-friends-in-adulthood/\">The Joys and Difficulties of Making Friendships in Adulthood</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://usmenssheds.org/\">Men’s Shed Association</a></li>\n</ul><h3><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-135483\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/04/81rDHgt2jnL.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"357\" height=\"550\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/04/81rDHgt2jnL.jpg 357w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/04/81rDHgt2jnL-320x493.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 357px) 100vw, 357px\"></img></h3>\n<h3>Connect With Billy</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.twitter.com/billy_baker\">Billy on Twitter</a></p>\n<h3>Listen to the Podcast!

This article was originally published in March 2018.</em></p>\n<p>Like most American boys, I played baseball in the summers. And as cliché as it may sound, I took away some important life lessons from my days on the diamond. One that has stuck with me and that I think about often even today is the adage on how to field ground balls:</p>\n<p><em>Play the ball before it plays you. </em></p>\n<p>I remember my coach repeating this mantra as we fielded grounders. “Play the ball before it plays you! Play the ball before it plays you!”</p>\n<p>When a kid is first learning to field a ground ball, his natural inclination is to stand still until the ball rolls to him. But baseballs do funny things once they hit grass and dirt. They change direction; they slow down. What they don’t do is go right into your glove. If a player passively waits for the ball to come to him, nine times out of ten, he’s going to come up empty-handed.</p>\n<p>“Play the ball before it plays you” is a cue to players to attack the ball and take the initiative on the grounder. It’s a call to be proactive and not reactive with your fielding. Good fielders make plays happen; bad fielders just wait and let the ball determine the play.</p>\n<p>Following “play the ball before it plays you” made me a better fielder. Whenever I attacked a grounder, things usually turned out better compared to when I just waited for the ball to roll to my feet.</p>\n<p>It wasn’t until I read <em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0743269519/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=0743269519&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess-20\">The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</a></em> by Stephen Covey when I was a freshman in high school that I realized that “play the ball before it plays you” also serves as an excellent maxim for life.</p>\n<h3><u>Be Proactive; Not Reactive</u></h3>\n<p>In his classic book, writer and businessman Stephen Covey laid out seven habits he believed led to a flourishing life. I remember when I read it as a 15-year-old kid I was blown away by his insights. I’ve been re-reading the book as a 35-year-old man, and twenty years later Covey still inspires me. Talk about staying power.</p>\n<p>I’ve been enjoying my re-read of the book so much, I’ve decided to do a monthly series, summarizing, expanding, and riffing on each of the seven habits.</p>\n<p>We start today with the first habit Covey delves into in the book, which lays the foundation for all the others: Be Proactive.</p>\n<p>Being proactive is a posture you take towards the world. It <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-own-up-to-mistakes/\">requires an individual to accept responsibility for his situation</a> (no matter how dire) and take the initiative to make things better. Instead of letting their conditions and circumstances be the driving force of their decisions, proactive people allow their values to determine the choices they make. Proactive people act rather than being acted upon.</p>\n<p>Proactive people play the ball before it plays them.</p>\n<p>Even when circumstances limit choices, a proactive person will find where he can still exercise his agency.</p>\n<p>Covey uses existential psychiatrist Viktor Frankl as a supreme example of being proactive even when it seems you’ve been stripped of every last bit of your autonomy. As a Jew living in Austria during WWII, he and his family were put into concentration camps where they were subjected to systemized, soul-crushing cruelty. Except for him and his sister, everyone in Frankl’s family was either directly executed in the gas chambers or eventually died from the camp’s punishing conditions.</p>\n<p>But it was in these horrific circumstances that Frankl had a life-changing epiphany. Despite losing all his basic freedoms, there was one freedom the guards could never take away from him: how he would respond to his circumstances.</p>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-82606 size-full\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2018/03/Proactive-Mindset.jpg\" alt=\"Poster of proactive mindset.\" width=\"500\" height=\"240\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2018/03/Proactive-Mindset.jpg 500w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2018/03/Proactive-Mindset-320x154.jpg 320w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2018/03/Proactive-Mindset-400x192.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\"></img></p>\n<p>“<strong>Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response</strong>,” wrote Frankl in his seminal book, <em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/080701429X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=080701429X&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess-20&#38;linkId=2XQGYPVIWS2UDFED\">Man’s Search for Meaning</a></em>. The stimuli Frankl encountered daily were death, deprivation, cruelty. The seemingly inevitable response to such stimuli would be to give up and lose hope. But there in the concentration camp, Frankl realized that stimulus and response weren’t welded together. There was a gap. There was a choice.</p>\n<p>Frankl consequently chose a different response than the default. He chose hope. He chose to help his fellow prisoners. He chose to not hate his captors. He chose to find meaning in his suffering.</p>\n<p>Frankl’s life represents a vivid archetype of what it means to be a proactive person.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_82604\" style=\"width: 510px;  border: 1px solid #dddddd; background-color: #f3f3f3; padding: 4px; margin: 10px; text-align:center; display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-82604\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-82604 size-full\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2018/03/Reactive-Mindset.jpg\" alt=\"Poster of reactive mindset.\" width=\"500\" height=\"240\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2018/03/Reactive-Mindset.jpg 500w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2018/03/Reactive-Mindset-320x154.jpg 320w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2018/03/Reactive-Mindset-400x192.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\"></img><p style=\" padding: 0 4px 5px; margin: 0;\" id=\"caption-attachment-82604\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Reactive people experience stimulus and response as “welded” together.</p></div>\n<p>The opposite of a proactive person is a reactive person. Reactive people let their circumstances and conditions control them. Reactive people think that stimulus and response are inextricably connected. They don’t see the gap between the two, and believe that one determines the other. So if the weather is foul, a reactive person will be in a foul mood, too. When a reactive person gets negative feedback, they become defensive and bitter. When a reactive person finds himself on the short end of the stick, he gripes about it instead of finding ways to get more stick.</p>\n<p>Reactive people don’t act; they’re acted upon.<br></br><a name=\"circles\"></a><br></br>\nReactive people let the ball of life play them rather than playing the ball.</p>\n<h3>Circles of Concern and Influence</h3>\n<p>Re-reading Covey’s chapter on being proactive convicted me because it allowed me to see that I have a lot of work to do on being a less reactive man. Intellectually I know that the foul moods I experience from time to time and the worries I experience on a day-to-day basis are the result of being reactive and not proactive to life’s challenges, and yet I still find myself resorting to reactive language whenever I encounter a problem:</p>\n<p><em>“There’s nothing I can do about this . . .”</em></p>\n<p><em>“I’ve got a morose personality. It’s just the way I am . . .”</em></p>\n<p><em>“Well, the reason I’m having this problem is that [insert name] is so thoughtless . . .”</em></p>\n<p>Often I see stimulus and response as welded together. I fail to acknowledge the space that exists for me to choose how I’m going to respond.</p>\n<p>But Covey has a mental model to help individuals who tend to be reactive start thinking and acting more proactively. It’s called the Circles of Concern and Influence.</p>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-82607 size-full\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2018/03/Circle-of-Concern-Influence.jpg\" alt=\"Poster about circle of concern and influence.\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2018/03/Circle-of-Concern-Influence.jpg 500w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2018/03/Circle-of-Concern-Influence-320x320.jpg 320w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2018/03/Circle-of-Concern-Influence-400x400.jpg 400w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2018/03/Circle-of-Concern-Influence-200x200.jpg 200w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2018/03/Circle-of-Concern-Influence-300x300.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\"></img></p>\n<p>Imagine a circle, and within that circle, you put all of your concerns: your health, job prospects, kids, finances, etc. Anything and everything that causes you to worry or keeps you up at night. Even the little stuff. This is your Circle of Concern.</p>\n<p>Now imagine a circle within that Circle of Concern. Inside that circle, you put the concerns that you have some or complete influence on. Yes, your financial situation may tie your stomach in knots, but there are things you can do about it like cutting back on spending or asking for a raise. This is your Circle of Influence.</p>\n<p>Some things won’t make it to your Circle of Influence and will remain just in your Circle of Concern. You can’t influence the weather, you can’t influence your luck, you can’t tell your body to not get cancer, and you don’t have much control over other people’s decisions.</p>\n<p>According to Covey, what separates reactive people from proactive people is which circle they spend the most time, attention, and energy in. Reactive people pay more attention to the items that are just in their Circle of Concern — the stuff they have little or no control over. The results of this are psychologically debilitating; as Covey observes, this “focus results in blaming and accusing attitudes, reactive language, and increased feelings of victimization.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_82608\" style=\"width: 510px;  border: 1px solid #dddddd; background-color: #f3f3f3; padding: 4px; margin: 10px; text-align:center; display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-82608\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-82608 size-full\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2018/03/Reactive-Focus.jpg\" alt=\"Poster about circle of concern and influence with reactive focus.\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2018/03/Reactive-Focus.jpg 500w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2018/03/Reactive-Focus-320x320.jpg 320w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2018/03/Reactive-Focus-400x400.jpg 400w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2018/03/Reactive-Focus-200x200.jpg 200w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2018/03/Reactive-Focus-300x300.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\"></img><p style=\" padding: 0 4px 5px; margin: 0;\" id=\"caption-attachment-82608\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">When you focus on your Circle of Concern, your Circle of Influence shrinks.</p></div>\n<p>Not only does focusing solely on your Circle of Concern make you feel like garbage, the resulting sense of helplessness actually makes your Circle of Influence shrink.

As you take more action, you gain more competency. And increased competency allows you to have more influence on the world around you. Things that were formerly just in your Circle of Concern will be now be added to your Circle of Influence. <em>Focusing on your Circle of Influence increases your Circle of Influence</em>.</p>\n<p>The Circles of Concern and Influence offers a powerful mental model because it captures in a simple diagram a truth that Stoic philosophers wrote about thousands of years ago and cognitive psychologists have tested in labs and clinics for the past few decades.</p>\n<p>For the Stoics, life was governed by a Dichotomy of Control. There are things you have no control over (Circle of Concern), and things you have some or complete control over (Circle of Influence). To live a good, tranquil, and flourishing life, the Stoic adherent strives to accept the reality of the former, while focusing his attention on the latter.</p>\n<p>Modern cognitive psychologists have confirmed what the Stoics and Dr. Covey preached. When we focus on things over which we don’t have any control, it stresses us out. A bit of stress during uncertain times can act as a positive way to prepare your mind and body for performance. But if you’re stressed out about uncertainty all the time, then not-so-good changes start to happen in your brain that create a vicious cycle of reactive anxiety. Chronic stress can cause your amygdala — the alarm system of your brain — to get larger, which in turn causes you to be more sensitive and reactive to your environment, making you more vulnerable to anxiety, anger, and fear. What’s more, chronic stress can blunt executive function, which makes it harder for you to accurately judge between actual and phony threats. To top it off, chronic stress blunts dopamine production, which our brains need to stay motivated to take action.</p>\n<p>So in a literal way, focusing on your Circle of Concern causes it to expand and your Circle of Influence to shrink. The stress that comes from spending your energy and attention on your Circle of Concern primes your brain to see more problems than solutions, reduces your ability to figure out what is and isn’t in your control, and blunts motivation to take action on the things you do have influence over. It’s a vicious cycle.</p>\n<h3>How to Be More Proactive</h3>\n<p>As someone who tends to focus on his Circle of Concern, let me say it’s hard work to overcome that tendency and focus on the Circle of Influence. A large part of it is likely due to genetics. I’m a little neurotic and morose by nature. So are other people in my family. We’re worrywarts who often feel melancholy and think in worst case scenarios.</p>\n<p>While I can’t do much to change the temperament I was born with, that doesn’t mean I have no control over how I react to the world around me; there’s still a space between the stimuli and the response. It may take more work for me to see that gap and be proactive than it does for someone less neurotic, but it can be done.</p>\n<p>Here are a few things that have helped me take a more proactive posture towards life:</p>\n<p><strong>Figure out what’s in your Circles of Concern and Influence.</strong> Sit down and make a list of all the things that worry you. Mentally purge all your anxiety on paper for a good 10 minutes. This list represents your Circle of Concern.</p>\n<p>Take a break and come back to your list. One by one ask yourself “Do I have some influence over it?” The influence can be small. It may be “send an email requesting advice about X concern.” You might not get a response, but it’s an action you can take to influence the outcome. If you can influence the outcome of something (in even a small way), put it on your Circle of Influence list. If you’re having trouble putting items on this list, ask a friend for their input. If you tend to focus on the negative, it can be helpful to have someone with a more proactive outlook on life show you how you <em>do </em>have control over things in your Circle of Concern.</p>\n<p>What this exercise will hopefully show you is that you have more control over your life than you think you do.</p>\n<p><strong>Watch your language.</strong> One thing Covey suggests doing to take a more proactive and less reactive posture towards life is to watch your language for reactive or proactive phrases. How you speak guides how you see the world. If most of your language is reactive, you’re likely going be more reactive. If it’s proactive, you’ll be more proactive.</p>\n<p>Some reactive phrases to look out for:</p>\n<ul><li>There’s nothing I can do.</li>\n<li>That’s just the way I am.</li>\n<li>He makes me so mad.</li>\n<li>They won’t allow that.</li>\n<li>I have to do that.</li>\n<li>I can’t.</li>\n<li>I must.</li>\n<li>If only.</li>\n</ul><p>Whenever you catch yourself using one of these reactive phrases, replace it with a proactive one:</p>\n<ul><li>Let’s look at our alternatives.</li>\n<li>I can choose a different approach.</li>\n<li>I control how I respond to this.</li>\n<li>I choose.</li>\n<li>I prefer.</li>\n<li>I will.</li>\n</ul><p>What Covey is suggesting here is a form of cognitive behavioral therapy. This particular practice is similar to <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/boosting-your-resiliency-part-2-avoiding-learned-helplessness-and-changing-your-explanatory-style/\">an exercise in modifying your “explanatory style”</a> that we wrote about in our series on resilience. It takes some work, but changing your words helps change your mindset.</p>\n<p><strong>Take action (no matter how small).</strong> While changing your mindset and language helps, the most powerful thing you can do to adopt a more proactive posture is simply to <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/meditations-wisdom-action/\">take action</a>. As you take action, you’ll begin to show yourself that you can have an influence on the world, which kickstarts a virtuous cycle of proactivity.</p>\n<p>Look at your Circle of Influence. What’s an action you can take to move one of its items in a positive direction? Your actions don’t have to be big. In fact, they shouldn’t be big. Whenever you face a problem, break it down into the smallest parts possible and tackle each part one by one. It makes the problem less daunting and more concrete.</p>\n<p>Those are some things that have worked for me. Maybe they’ll work for you, too.</p>\n<p>Play the ball before it plays you.</p>\n<p>Act; don’t be acted upon.</p>\n<p>Be proactive; not reactive.</p>\n<p><strong>Be sure to listen to my podcast with Stephen’s son about his father’s famous principles: </strong></p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://omny.fm/shows/the-art-of-manliness/607-the-7-habits-of-highly-effective-people/embed\" width=\"100%\" height=\"180px\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>Read the Whole Series</strong></p>\n<ol><li>Be Proactive, Not Reactive</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/the-7-habits-begin-with-the-end-in-mind/\">Begin With the End in Mind</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/the-7-habits-put-first-things-first/\">Put First Things First</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/the-7-habits-think-win-win/\">Think Win/Win</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/the-7-habits-seek-first-to-understand-then-to-be-understood/\">Seek First to Understand, Then to Be Understood</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/the-7-habits-synergize-beyond-the-eye-rolling-buzzword/\">Synergy (Beyond the Eye-Rolling Buzzword)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/the-7-habits-sharpen-the-saw/\">Sharpen the Saw</a></li>\n</ol><p>_____________________________________________________________</p>\n<p>Concepts and figures from <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0743269519/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=0743269519&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess-20\"><em>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</em></a></p>\n<div id=\"pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg\"></div>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/7-habits-proactive-not-reactive/\">The 7 Habits: Be Proactive, Not Reactive</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com\">The Art of Manliness</a>.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheArtOfManliness/~4/C50dUv8Ker0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 18 Apr 2021 12:38:52 +0000","feedId":13,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"09963cc947f708981b400b9fdb0257fa","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Brett and Kate McKay","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2018/03/play.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn53@2020_4/2021/04/23/17-35-32-326_282c81b7f6aa22a7.webp","https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2018/03/Proactive-Mindset.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn80@2020_5/2021/04/23/17-35-32-394_936161a102ddde83.webp","https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2018/03/Reactive-Mindset.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn95@2020_6/2021/04/23/17-35-32-375_78ea74e24e00249e.webp","https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2018/03/Circle-of-Concern-Influence.jpg":null,"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2018/03/Reactive-Focus.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn59@2020_6/2021/04/23/17-35-32-623_9491e024ea383051.webp","https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2018/03/Proactive-Focus.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn8@2020_6/2021/04/23/17-35-44-331_7d1f935a2fe6e28b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheArtOfManliness/~4/C50dUv8Ker0":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn52@2020_5/2021/04/23/17-35-32-241_674339053b758d49.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1619199319305},{"createdTime":"2021-04-24 01:35:19","updatedTime":"2021-04-24 01:35:19","title":"The Power of Writing by Hand","link":"https://www.artofmanliness.com/?p=135214","description":"<h4 id=\"pressboard-ad-sponsorship-tag\" style=\"margin-bottom: 35px;\"></h4><p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-135220\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/04/hand-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/04/hand-1.jpg 650w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/04/hand-1-372x230.jpg 372w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/04/hand-1-320x197.jpg 320w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/04/hand-1-640x394.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\"></img></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In spite of the countless note-taking and to-do list apps and software I’ve experimented with over the years, I always come back to writing things down on paper. Though I still use the apps for checklists and for master lists of things, my day-to-day note-taking and prioritizing happens on pen and paper (or dry erase marker and whiteboard). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While there have been plenty of studies in recent decades that aim to explain the durable allure of “manual” writing, </span><a href=\"https://time.com/3982285/bic-writing-hand-benefits/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">if you look at the research closer</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a lot of the benefits attributed to it aren’t exclusive to that kind of writing, nor have they always been replicated in subsequent studies. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But I don’t need scientific verification to affirm what I have discovered intuitively though my own firsthand, n=1 experiments. Below I outline a bunch of benefits to writing things down by hand that I’ve observed through simple field-testing; try taking up a pen (<a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/a-beginners-guide-to-the-underappreciated-pencil/\">or pencil</a>) more often yourself, and you may find similar advantages, or others entirely your own.</span></p>\n<h3>Boosts your memory through encoding.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If there </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> one scientifically-proven and replicable benefit of manual writing, it’s this: when you write something by hand you can improve your memory, and therefore your ability to recall information, through the process of encoding. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are a number of factors at play here, but the gist is that writing manually uses far more brain processing systems than typing. You’re physically coordinating your brain and hand in a deeper way; you’re forced to organize information more concisely (more on that below); you have to actually think a little harder to write something with your hand versus on a keyboard or screen. All of this leads to the information coming out of your writing utensil being encoded on a deeper level into your memory. When you type, it’s almost like the information is simply using your body as a conduit for being transferred onto a screen; when you write, the information is actually being stored and processed for later use and recall.  </span></p>\n<h3>Forces you to think and filter.</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you write something down by hand, you’re taking advantage of the benefits of constraints. By limiting yourself both in physical space (you can only get so much on a page) and physical ability (you can only write so quickly), you’re forcing yourself to decide what’s most important. If you’re taking notes or writing out to-dos on a screen, there’s literally endless space to do so; it’s actually pretty easy to mindlessly type out highlights from a lecture or make a list of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">every single thing</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that you’re thinking about in the moment. You’ll type out a forest and have no sense of the trees. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No matter your canvas when writing by hand, you’ve got boundaries. You have to pay more attention, think it all through a little more carefully, decide which items to cut and which to keep. Think of the page as being a built-in filter for the stuff floating around in your consciousness. </span></p>\n<h3>Creates a visual reminder that keeps things top of mind.</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While list-making and note-taking apps are handy, once the screen is turned off or put into your pocket, those ideas go away. Out of sight, out of mind — truly. For example, while </span><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/todoist-productivity-tips/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I still use Todoist every day</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, it inevitably gets lost among the dozen tabs I have open on my computer, and I sure don’t think of it when I’m on my phone because I’m using a handful of other apps all the time. There’s too much digital clutter for it to be top of mind when it seems like I really need it, which is when I’m distracted — it’s kind of a catch-22.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In contrast, I can keep something that I’ve written down — whether it’s a list of tasks or an inspiring phrase — constantly in front of my eyes. I don’t have to remember to remember it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I recently bought a </span><a href=\"https://fluidstance.com/products/slope\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">FluidStance desktop whiteboard</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and have really benefited from it. When I write down a research plan for an article or my top few priorities for the day — </span><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/work-deliberately-instead-reactively-rule-3/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rule of 3 for the win!</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> — I don’t have to spend mental energy on remembering those things. I know that they’re recorded and will continually be in my peripheral vision for the entire work day. When I get distracted, all I have to do to snap myself back on track is simply glance down and see my written reminders of what needs to be done.</span></p>\n<h3>Minimizes distraction.</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Things that are written down by hand are not only readily accessible in the midst of distraction, but won’t put you in touch with other distractions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Swipe into your phone to take a note in your note-taking app . . . and you’ll find your finger wandering over to the Instagram app. And the Twitter app. Soon enough, even though you finished typing your note ten minutes ago, you’re still twiddling with your phone.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fight it with time limits and app blockers all you want, but the digital distraction dragon cannot be slayed once and for all. I’ve come to accept it. Moving to pen and paper for my daily note-taking and list-making — again, the checklists and master lists of things still reside in Todoist — has ensured that I stay more focused throughout the day and get my most valuable tasks taken care of. Writing things down with pen and paper minimizes the need to toggle from screen to screen, app to app, and tab to tab, which presents me with fewer opportunities to get sucked into <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/podcast-450-how-to-make-time-for-what-really-matters-every-day/\">the internet’s “infinity pools.”</a> I still get distracted, sure, but it takes far less time to get back on track when I’m not relying on my screen to guide my to-dos or my article writing. </span></p>\n<h3>Allows for more creative organizing and mental processing. </h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the things I appreciate most about writing things on paper (or whiteboard) is the ability to organize things in a way that goes beyond the line-by-line format offered by most note-taking and to-do list apps. I can draw boxes around important items, I can make arrows between connected ideas, I can set lists in columns and even draw pictures if needed. Some apps allow for that sort of freeform writing, but they’re invariably clunky. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The mind does not often operate on a clear-cut, step-by-step path. Allow your writing to follow its back and forth, loop-de-loop processes by writing things out manually.   </span></p>\n<h3>There’s a unique kinetic energy to it.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though certainly not a measurable benefit, there’s a unique, unexplainable power to the idea that words are flowing from your brain, through your arm and hand, and out onto a page. It’s a very physical process that just isn’t the same when it’s words flowing through a keyboard and into the digital ether. The slowness of writing forces deeper contemplation; the way your hand muscles get just a little bit tired (surely because we simply don’t use those muscles much anymore!) is physical evidence that you’re doing </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">work</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">; the visual and tangible proof of ideas come to life is far more inspiring than seeing it on a Word Doc. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s a reason that some of our greatest modern writers — J.K. Rowling, Neil Gaiman, Stephen King, Joyce Carol Oates, the list goes on — still prefer longhand to a digital manuscript (for first drafts, at least).

Whether you’ve settled into a fishing spot only to realize you forgot to put hooks in <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/10-things-every-mans-fishing-tackle-box-needs/\">your otherwise well-stocked tackle box</a>, or find yourself in a survival situation where there are no manufactured hooks to be had, knowing this transformational trick can come in handy.</p>\n<p>The most difficult part of this otherwise simple process is actually just removing the tab from the can without breaking off its “eyelet.” If yours does come off, all is not lost; you can still make a less elegant version of the hook <a href=\"https://www.instructables.com/How-to-turn-a-bottle-tab-into-a-survival-fish-hook/\">this way</a>. Do take care when twisting and folding the eyelet back as well; the aluminum is brittle and can break, and you also don’t want to cut your fingers on sharp bits.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.storytellersworkshop.com\"><em>Illustrated by Ted Slampyak</em></a></p>\n<div id=\"pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg\"></div>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-make-a-fishing-hook-out-of-a-can-tab/\">How to Make a Fishing Hook Out of a Can Tab</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com\">The Art of Manliness</a>.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheArtOfManliness/~4/AT-uklvIkcg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 15 Apr 2021 19:03:20 +0000","feedId":13,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"3a6eed72c27c18e9b1bc59425d5b7e28","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Brett &#38; Kate McKay","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/04/Pull-Tab-Fish-Hook-1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn1@2020_2/2021/04/23/17-35-32-310_8c639219fab6720b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheArtOfManliness/~4/AT-uklvIkcg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn59@2020_3/2021/04/23/17-35-32-354_3d71c7a486b198fe.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1619199319300},{"createdTime":"2021-04-24 01:35:19","updatedTime":"2021-04-24 01:35:19","title":"Podcast #700: The Life and Afterlife of Harry Houdini","link":"https://www.artofmanliness.com/?p=135232","description":"<h4 id=\"pressboard-ad-sponsorship-tag\" style=\"margin-bottom: 35px;\"></h4><p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"The Life and Afterlife of Harry Houdini\" src=\"https://omny.fm/shows/the-art-of-manliness/the-life-and-afterlife-of-harry-houdini/embed\" width=\"100%\" height=\"180\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Quick, think of a famous magician.</p>\n<p>Dimes to donuts, you just thought of Harry Houdini.</p>\n<p>Though it’s been almost a century since his death, Houdini still occupies a prime place in the cultural imagination, and my guest explains why in his book, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1501137239/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=1501137239&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess&#38;linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\"><em>The Life and Afterlife of Harry Houdini</em></a>, and for us today on the show. His name is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JPosnanski\">Joe Posnanski</a>, and we begin our conversation with Houdini’s childhood — how he mythologized it and carved a path out for himself from his desire to not be like his father. We then discuss Houdini’s early days as a magician, the trick he honed that helped make his name, and the outsized importance of that name in his fame and legacy. We then explore how escape artistry became Houdini’s calling card and why it resonated so much with the public. We get into the way Houdini brought an athlete’s physicality and mindset to his performances, and how the difference between magic and escape artistry can be described as the difference between the impossible and the amazing. From there we turn to the fact that Houdini was, and wasn’t, interested in money, his insatiable ambition and drive for fame, and how even the turn he took later in life towards debunking spiritualism kept him in the public eye. We end our conversation with why some modern magicians downplay Houdini’s talents, while he yet remains an enduring cultural icon amongst the public.</p>\n<p><em>If reading this in an email, click the title of the post to listen to the show.</em></p>\n<h3>Show Highlights</h3>\n<ul><li>What led Joe, a sportswriter, to write a bio about Houdini </li>\n<li>What was Houdini’s childhood like? </li>\n<li>The state of magic when Houdini was getting into the industry</li>\n<li>Where the name came from </li>\n<li>Was there an early act that cemented Houdini’s future as a magician?</li>\n<li>The difference between magic and escape artistry </li>\n<li>Why is escape is so fascinating</li>\n<li>The athletic prowess and mindset of Houdini </li>\n<li>Harry’s relentless ambition and what really drove him </li>\n<li>Joe’s favorite Houdini tricks </li>\n<li>Houdini’s debunking of spiritualism </li>\n<li>What was it that really killed Houdini? </li>\n<li>His lasting influence on magic and how he became an archetype </li>\n<li>Why does Houdini still captivate us today?</li>\n</ul><h3>Resources/Articles/People Mentioned in Podcast</h3>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/babe-ruth-jane-leavy-interview/\">Babe Ruth and the World He Made</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/podcast-454-a-magicians-search-for-wonder-in-the-modern-world/\">A Magician’s Search for Wonder in the Modern World</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/lessons-in-manliness-from-harry-houdini/\">Lessons in Manliness From Harry Houdini</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/?s=cool+uncle+tricks\">Cool Uncle Tricks</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rifKYeqvEis\">Houdini’s Metamorphosis trick</a> </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Eug%C3%A8ne_Robert-Houdin\">Robert-Houdin, the father of magic</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/bernarr-macfadden-fitness-guru/\">The Crazy, Forgotten Story of America’s First Fitness Influencer</a> </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=houdini+in+chains&#38;sxsrf=ALeKk01nbh6Ji3uKtiwI6QSfC2RWguptBg:1618413544185&#38;source=lnms&#38;tbm=isch&#38;sa=X&#38;ved=2ahUKEwj-65mjhP7vAhXaAp0JHSZUCOMQ_AUoAXoECAEQAw&#38;cshid=1618413559231116&#38;biw=1710&#38;bih=938\">Houdini in chains</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Water_Torture_Cell\">Water Torture Cell trick</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0wNOchd6EQ\">Houdini’s greatest handcuff challenge</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1982180587/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=1982180587&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess&#38;linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\"><em>The Baseball 100</em></a></li>\n</ul><h3><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-135234\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/04/houdini-pos.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"364\" height=\"550\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/04/houdini-pos.jpg 364w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/04/houdini-pos-320x484.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 364px) 100vw, 364px\"></img></h3>\n<h3>Connect With Joe</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/JPosnanski\">Joe on Twitter</a></p>\n<h3>Listen to the Podcast!

Laird, a professor of psychology. It has been condensed from the original.</em></p>\n<p>What can one do to make certain that he is not being handicapped in his progress through life by unwittingly making himself disliked? How can one tell whether or not he is disliked without going to the embarrassment of asking his friends and associates? What can one do to control his own conduct and attitudes so that he will be better liked?</p>\n<p>These are all practical questions of the greatest personal importance. And until recently no definite answers could be given to them.</p>\n<p>To find the answers to these questions and other similar ones the Colgate Psychological Laboratory undertook experimental work in which the relative significance of nearly one hundred traits and habits, in their effect on personal likes and dislikes, was accurately measured. Only traits and habits which we can reasonably expect to be able to alter for the better by an application of good old-fashioned willpower and self-development were studied.</p>\n<p>This experimental work produced evidence that some forty-six traits are of definite importance in determining the emotional attitude of other people toward us. About the same number of other traits, in spite of their apparently important nature, were found to have no appreciable influence, either favorable or unfavorable.</p>\n<p><strong><em>These traits make little difference</em></strong></p>\n<p>You can dress as flashily as Mayor Jimmy Walker or Glenn Frank, or as conservative as Herbert Hoover or Calvin Coolidge. It will make no difference to your acquaintances. They will continue to like or dislike you just the same. What does make a difference is whether you keep your clothing neat and tidy — but that is getting ahead of our story.</p>\n<p>It makes no difference in your popularity whether you are always easy-going or always in a hurry. You can be a go-getter, a prodigious worker, or relatively leisurely, calm, and unperturbed. But don’t be lazy. As we shall see later, laziness makes a difference.</p>\n<p>You can discuss your health in detail. You can sit down and enlarge upon your operations or your stomachache without incurring dislike. This is undoubtedly fortunate, since probably one-quarter of the world likes nothing better than to brag of its operations and other physical ailments.</p>\n<p>We had expected to find that this talking about personal ailments showed up as a significant trait. It happens that personally I dislike to listen to other people’s pains. It bores me to profanity. That must be because I am rather a Pollyanna and like to see the pleasant side of things. At any rate the results showed that that dislike was just an individual peculiarity of my own.</p>\n<p>It does not matter whether you watch the pennies closely or not. Tight wads and spendthrifts share equally in friends.</p>\n<p>You can argue on either side of religious questions.</p>\n<p>You can swear only under emotional strain, or swear as habitually as you like.</p>\n<p>You can play practical jokes.</p>\n<p>None of these things affects the feelings of other people in general towards you.</p>\n<p>Your voice can be musical or rasping. That is another trait which I was surprised to find of no significance. I find myself taking a marked dislike to the voices of some people, but to the average person voices make no difference. It does not matter whether a voice is high pitched or low pitched. But there are some things about the voice that are important, as will be apparent soon.</p>\n<p>You can giggle and laugh at everything.</p>\n<p>You can use big words. You can use slang. You can talk on intelligent topics. You can have an accent in your speech. You can use foreign phrases. You can indulge a weakness for pet phrases, such as “I should say so.” None of these habits will have any noticeable effect.</p>\n<p>You can pause and hem habitually in the midst of conversations, in search of the right word.</p>\n<p>You can make puns.</p>\n<p>You can pull on the coat lapels of your auditor, or even put your arm around his shoulder.</p>\n<p>All these things, <em>in general</em>, may be done with safety. It may be, however, that the key man on whom your chance for promotion depends is one who, like myself, dislikes people who talk about their personal troubles, or who have rasping voices. If the liking of some one individual is especially important to your happiness or your advancement, it is hardly safe to go by any general rules. That individual’s tastes are worth a special study.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Watch these traits closely</em></strong></p>\n<p>Now for the more important traits, the ones which definitely make most people like us. In order of their importance, we have given these positive traits a weight that varies from one to three. The first nine in the list below all have a weight of three.</p>\n<p><em>Be depended upon to do what you say you will. </em>This trait alone may not make people like you, if you have others in large numbers which offset it, but it is one which you can gamble on. It affects not only your responsibility to your superior, but your relations to practically every person with whom you come in even casual contact. </p>\n<p><em>Go out of your way to help others.</em></p>\n<p><em>Do not show off your knowledge.</em> The teacher or parent or executive is apt to be disliked, from the very nature of the tasks he is called upon to perform. Those who want to be liked must try to gain favor by other traits. They must, for instance, possess the two just described above.</p>\n<p><em>Do not let yourself feel superior to your associates, and be careful lest they get the impression that you do. </em></p>\n<p><em>Do not reprimand people who do things that displease you.</em></p>\n<p><em>Do not exaggerate in your statements. </em>In spite of the commonness of the habit of telling tall stories, and its apparent innocuousness in most cases, this is one of the traits which was found to be most important as a ground for dislike. We did not go far enough to make sure whether merely telling good fish stories would lose a sportsman friends, but a chronic habit of overstatement certainly will.</p>\n<p><em>Do not make fun of others behind their backs. </em>Here is a case in point. I know the general manager of a certain company, a man in some ways very clever in social matters. His company dominates the small town in which it is located. When he came there they almost had the brass band out to welcome him. Six months later he could hardly have found a townsman to give him a lift down the road without a scowl.</p>\n<p>This man is tremendously capable. What got him into trouble was nothing that he did on the job. It was what he did after office hours. Out on the local nine-hole golf course, in the post-office while waiting for the evening mail, or to entertain guests in his own home, he would tell embarrassingly funny things that had happened to fellow townsmen, or would imitate in hilarious fashion a fellow golfer’s manner of making a shot. Good entertainment – but it left everyone feeling a little afraid that “tomorrow he may be making fun of me.”</p>\n<p><em>Do not be sarcastic. </em>This habit probably operates on the mental reactions of others in very much the same way as the habit of making fun of other people.</p>\n<p><em>Do not be domineering. </em></p>\n<p>This completes the list of the traits to which I have given a value of 3. These alone give us already a pretty fair picture of human likes and dislikes and their reasons. People in general dislike exaggeration, dislike undependability, dislike the man who will not go out of his way to help others. These broader traits they feel very strongly. The underlying moral code indicated by the nature of these dislikes is definitely a good one. Needless to say, it is a code which lies much deeper than such surface manifestation as minor weaknesses for liquor, for gambling, for shady stories, and the like. In themselves those have no effect on the emotions of other people toward us.</p>\n<p>Before we go on with the traits that have a weight of 2, it would be well to give some explanation of the psychological theories that emerge, so that the remaining traits can be viewed in relation to them. It appears from our data and discussions with individuals who have contributed to the work that in general we dislike people for one of three reasons. We may dislike them because we are afraid of them. They are sarcastic, or they are likely to make fun of us to our backs. We may dislike them because they deflate our ego. They boss us, they are domineering, they know more than we know, or in some way make us feel smaller. We may dislike them because they do petty things of one kind or another that annoy us. The traits with a value of 3 or 2 bear the closest relation to deflating our ego or making us afraid. Conversely, the affirmative traits of equal values are those which bring happiness and emotional exhilaration to those with whom their possessors come in contact. The traits of minor importance, those with a value of only 1, have more to do with annoyance.</p>\n<p>Here are the traits with a value of 2.</p>\n<p><em>Keep your clothing neat and tidy. </em>Cleanliness is still next to the greatest virtues. It is liked almost as well as dependability and helpfulness.</p>\n<p><em>Do not laugh at the mistakes of others. </em>Never laugh at a man because he comes to a social function in a queer costume, or uses the wrong fork at table, or appears on the street with his shirt tail hanging out. Get your laugh from the movies, the vaudeville act, or the pages of Judge or Life. Don’t take it out on other people in real life.</p>\n<p><em>Do not take a vulgar attitude toward the opposite sex. </em>Although most people do not object to shady stories, they do object by and large to a generally vulgar attitude toward the opposite sex.</p>\n<p><em>Do not be inclined to find fault with everybody else. </em>Like a good many of the other traits which promote dislike, this one tends to increase a little with age, especially with extreme age. This accentuation of disagreeable traits with advancing age explains why young people think old people are harder to get along with.</p>\n<p><em>Do not correct the mistakes of others. </em>Don’t try to serve as a grammar or a book of etiquette for your friends. If they want to get criticism, they are perfectly capable of asking for it, or learning their errors from an authoritative book. It doesn’t pay to give gratuitous advice of that kind.</p>\n<p><em>Do not tell jokes at the expense of those listening. </em>Very similar to but not the same as the trait of making fun of people behind their backs. </p>\n<p><em>Do not try to have your own way. </em>This is not the same as domineering! If your superior tells you to do such and such a thing in a certain way, don’t insist on going ahead doing it the same old way you always did just out of obstinacy.</p>\n<p><em>Do not lose your temper.</em></p>\n<p><em>Do not take the initiative in argument.</em></p>\n<p><em>Smile pleasantly.</em></p>\n<p><em>Do not talk continuously.</em> It does not matter whether your voice is high-pitched or low-pitched, rasping or musical, whether you use pet phrases, foreign phrases, or slang. These habits are all neutral in effect, but continuous talking is not. This handicap seems to be more common among women as a sex than men, yet we have found in some experiments that, contrary to general impressions, young men talk more than young women. Moreover, the young women do not like this trait in their masculine acquaintances. </p>\n<p><em>Do not pry into other people’s business. </em></p>\n<p>The following traits have a value of 1:</p>\n<p><em>Do not ask favors of others.</em></p>\n<p><em>Do not be out of patience with modern ideas.</em></p>\n<p><em>Do not talk about your personal troubles. </em>You can talk about your health, but do not discuss your other troubles, such as your financial reverses, your family quarrels, or the mean things other people have done to you.</p>\n<p><em>Do not spread gossip. </em>Gossips are not popular even among their own kind.</p>\n<p><em> Be cheerful.</em></p>\n<p><em>Be enthusiastic, </em>not lethargic.</p>\n<p><em>Do not mispronounce words. </em>James M. Barrie once used this characteristic, in his play “A Kiss for Cinderella,” as a clever trick to build up dislike for one of the characters, the policeman who continually made mistakes in pronunciation.</p>\n<p><em>Do not be suspicious that people are trying to put something over on you.</em></p>\n<p><em>Do not be lazy. </em>You can be a high pressure worker or an easy going one without any visible effect on your popularity, but if you are lazy you will be disliked for it. </p>\n<p><em>Do not borrow things.</em></p>\n<p><em>Do not correct the mistakes of others.</em></p>\n<p><em>Do not try to get people to believe as you believe. </em>This habit is similar to that of taking the initiative in argument.</p>\n<p><em>Do not be a political radical.</em></p>\n<p><em>Do not talk rapidly. </em>Talking continuously has a value of 2, talking rapidly has a value of 1.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Like if you want to be liked</em></strong></p>\n<p>In one phase of our experiment we asked subjects to write down as fast as they could the initials of all the people they could think of whom they disliked intensely. At the end of a half-minute we stopped them. In that half-minute some had been able to think of only one person for whom they felt intense dislike. Others thought of as many as 14. Some thought of those they disliked as rapidly as they could write down initials.</p>\n<p>This test showed that those who expressed their dislike for the largest number of persons were the very individuals who themselves possessed the largest number of generally disliked traits. This makes us feel safe in stating in a general way that if you dislike many people you probably are in turn disliked by many people. And by the same token if you like many people you are probably liked by many.</p>\n<div id=\"pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg\"></div>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/why-we-like-some-people-and-dont-like-others/\">Why We Like Some People and Don’t Like Others</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com\">The Art of Manliness</a>.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheArtOfManliness/~4/EIqVkFw_8m0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 20 Apr 2021 16:13:58 +0000","feedId":13,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"e25da78eaff9361c04c4fc5f9cbdf232","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Brett &#38; Kate McKay","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/04/like.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn45@2020_2/2021/04/23/17-35-32-358_1708e345ee78ef93.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheArtOfManliness/~4/EIqVkFw_8m0":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn56@2020_3/2021/04/23/17-35-32-304_09262726f2047e41.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1619199319300},{"createdTime":"2021-04-24 01:35:19","updatedTime":"2021-04-24 01:35:19","title":"11 Secretive Spots to Hide Valuables in Your Home","link":"https://www.artofmanliness.com/?p=135487","description":"<h4 id=\"pressboard-ad-sponsorship-tag\" style=\"margin-bottom: 35px;\"></h4><p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-135498\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/04/Hide-Valuables-Header-2-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/04/Hide-Valuables-Header-2-1.jpg 780w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/04/Hide-Valuables-Header-2-1-768x429.jpg 768w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/04/Hide-Valuables-Header-2-1-320x179.jpg 320w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/04/Hide-Valuables-Header-2-1-640x358.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px\"></img></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether cash, passports, jewelry, or other important valuables, we all have things we need to hide now and again, whether from the prying eyes and hands of children or the unnerving but very real threat of burglars. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Luckily, a lot of the stuff you really want to hide is pretty small and inconspicuous. Many people rely on safes to store these things, which is a good option, but you don’t necessarily want to keep all your goods in one location. If you think just a little bit outside the (steel-reinforced) box, there are a lot of places in the home that can be as secure as a (typically quite conspicuous) safe.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do keep in mind that if you’re utilizing multiple hiding places, you also need to remember where this stuff is. Write it down and keep it in a safe place. I’ve been guilty of finding cash in unexpected spots years later. </span></p>\n<h3>Book Safe</h3>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-135503\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/04/book-safe2.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/04/book-safe2.jpeg 640w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/04/book-safe2-320x240.jpeg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\"></img></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-make-a-secret-book-safe/\">Brett and Kate have previously covered how to make a secret safe out of a book</a>. It’s a pretty easy evening or weekend project: find a book (the more boring the title the better; you don’t want non-criminal guests and children to curiously grab it to thumb through), hollow it out, add your goodies, and stash on the shelf. If that’s too small for what you have in mind, Family Handyman has </span><a href=\"https://www.familyhandyman.com/article/diy-hiding-place-from-old-books/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a good instructional on making a larger, multi-volume book box</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<h3>Old Vacuum</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is a great option, in my opinion. Anything with a large open cavity is a good spot to stash some valuables. Modern garage door openers have a large space at the back where the light bulb is; old and unused electronics like TVs and computer towers often have space; the best of the bunch, though, might be an old, unused/non-functioning vacuum cleaner. Canister types aren’t great because they’re often made with a clear plastic that would reveal the valuables stashed within, but the kind that uses a bag is perfect. Take the bag out, place your goodies inside, and put the cover back on. Keep it in a closet and no burglar will touch it. A non-working shop vac stored in the garage is a good choice too. </span></p>\n<h3>Pringles Can</h3>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-101819\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2019/02/IMG_0640.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2019/02/IMG_0640.jpg 600w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2019/02/IMG_0640-320x240.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"></img></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s common for burglars to search through liquor cabinets and pantries, so you don’t want them to be able to simply lift the lid off an oatmeal canister and see a roll of cash sittin’ in an otherwise empty container. What you need is a pantry item that looks like the real deal, but hides a secret compartment within.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Enter the transformed Pringles Can. <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-turn-a-pringles-can-into-a-secret-safe/\">You can cut away the bottom of a can of potato crisps to make a small and functional safe with a bit of PVC and hot glue</a>. If you open the lid at the top of the can, you see Pringles stacked inside it, just like the real deal. The problem, of course, is that you (or another family member) might forget the safe is there, eat the chips, and toss the can in the trash. It might be better to put your Pringles can next to your computer or on a shelf in the garage; Mr. Burglar will think you just like to snack outside the confines of the kitchen. Sometimes the least suspicious “hiding” spot for something is in plain sight.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the idea appeals, there are any number of false containers you can buy for your fridge and/or pantry. </span><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01H45E9G4/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=B01H45E9G4&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess&#38;linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fake Spam</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> might be my favorite. </span></p>\n<h3>False Bottom Drawer</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Secret compartments in drawers and cupboards have been used for centuries for hiding treasure maps, money, and jewelry alike. A false bottom drawer creates a space between the original bottom of the drawer and the “fake” bottom that you’re creating. That inch or two of space can hide any number of valuables.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You might think you need some DIY chops to make one, but even a total noob can do this project in less than an afternoon. All you need is a thin board, ideally one that somewhat matches the real bottom, cut into the size of your drawer and some supports to keep it off the original bottom of the drawer. </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-faVWN9JZ0\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This version from The King of Random</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> provides an additional layer of security via a magnetic locking mechanism and secret “key” (which is just any long, thin object like a pen or wooden dowel). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though false bottom drawers make for pretty well-hidden compartments, burglars are certainly aware of their possible existence. So stay away from putting them in the drawers of a master bedroom nightstand or an office desk, as this furniture resides in two rooms that burglars hit most often and take the time to search beyond the obvious places. To make it especially secretive, do it with a kids’ dresser or the guest bathroom vanity. Any kitchen drawer also works, just make sure to do it with a deep one. </span></p>\n<h3>Back of the Drawer </h3>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-135490\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/04/drawer.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/04/drawer.jpg 640w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/04/drawer-320x240.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\"></img></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the false bottom doesn’t appeal to you, you can take the entire drawer out and duct tape an envelope of cash or secret identity papers to the back of it. There’s always some space in the back of the dresser or cabinets, so nothing will get too squished. </span></p>\n<h3>Storage Bins</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take advantage of simple labeling to store some valuables in plain sight. While burglars may look through a storage room, they aren’t likely to reach for a box that says “Kids Clothes” or “College Textbooks.” Don’t keep anything too valuable out in the “open” like that, but it can work for low-value things you still want hidden, or even holiday/birthday presents.</span></p>\n<h3>Old Paint Cans</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every homeowner has a stash of old paint cans that are likely either dried up or nearly empty. Take one or two that you don’t need and store just about anything small and valuable inside them and in a plastic bag. No burglar is going to rummage through a collection of old paint cans. </span></p>\n<h3>Medicine Bottle</h3>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-135491\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/04/rock.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/04/rock.jpg 640w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/04/rock-320x200.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\"></img></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Medicine cabinets are one of the first places that burglars tend to look. They’ll take all the drugs indiscriminately for their street value. So don’t go hiding things in there. But medicine bottles can still be useful as containers in which to store a valuable, which is then secreted outside the bathroom. For example, instead of the usual hiding places, stash your extra house key in an old Advil bottle and super glue it to the bottom of a real rock (those fake ones always look it). Then make a little cavity in the dirt and place the bottle down inside it, with only the rock showing on the surface. </span></p>\n<h3>Fake Plumbing </h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’re feeling ambitious and need quite a lot of secret storage — perhaps you’re working on some Jason Bourne-esque operation — consider installing some fake PVC piping as fake plumbing in a storage area. Using as big of a pipe as you need, start from the wall, add as many segments as desired, include a cleanout for easy access, and never worry again about someone finding out your secret identity. </span></p>\n<h3>Toilet Paper Tube </h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_135492\" style=\"width: 649px;  border: 1px solid #dddddd; background-color: #f3f3f3; padding: 4px; margin: 10px; text-align:center; display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-135492\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-135492\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/04/towel-bar.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/04/towel-bar.jpg 639w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/04/towel-bar-320x234.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 639px) 100vw, 639px\"></img><p style=\" padding: 0 4px 5px; margin: 0;\" id=\"caption-attachment-135492\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">None of the TP tubes in my home are hollow, but I have a towel bar that works perfectly as a hiding spot.</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This trick is only good for a pretty limited range of secret stashables — cash, small notes, a mini USB drive (wrapped in a napkin to muffle the noise) — but utilizes a spot that won’t be searched by burglars. Not every toilet paper holder tube is hollow, but if you have one, consider using it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can do the same thing with towel racks/bars, but those are a little less accessible since you often have to unscrew one of the ends to access it. Talk about secure, though. </span></p>\n<h3><b>In the Freezer </b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Burglars may actually look in the freezer — they know it’s a popular place to hide valuables — but they’re likely to be checking for out-of-place items. So if you’re going to stash something in there, put your valuables on the bottom, and make sure they’re hidden in actual food containers/bags. Something like an emptied-out sugar-free ice cream container or a Costco bag of cauliflower rice — in other words, stuff even your home’s lawful tenants are disinclined to pick up. </span></p>\n<div id=\"pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg\"></div>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/11-place-to-hide-things-in-your-home/\">11 Secretive Spots to Hide Valuables in Your Home</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com\">The Art of Manliness</a>.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheArtOfManliness/~4/rYGo4UARWpg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 22 Apr 2021 15:56:34 +0000","feedId":13,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"c056414baea24b9043859c3df10499b6","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Jeremy Anderberg","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/04/Hide-Valuables-Header-2-1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn72@2020_5/2021/04/23/17-35-32-695_6557ff0eaf15460f.webp","https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/04/book-safe2.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn81@2020_3/2021/04/23/17-35-32-498_3b839fe61518bd4e.webp","https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2019/02/IMG_0640.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn97@2020_5/2021/04/23/17-35-42-307_850944216fc3f34f.webp","https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/04/drawer.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn67@2020_3/2021/04/23/17-35-32-744_7224c84c70ece96a.webp","https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/04/rock.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn19@2020_5/2021/04/23/17-35-32-329_6608e189799d5987.webp","https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/04/towel-bar.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn99@2020_3/2021/04/23/17-35-44-589_3ed3f2a26364ceb3.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheArtOfManliness/~4/rYGo4UARWpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn68@2020_4/2021/04/23/17-35-32-250_90745407225cba6a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1619199319300},{"createdTime":"2021-04-24 01:35:19","updatedTime":"2021-04-24 01:35:19","title":"Podcast #701: Why Are We Restless?","link":"https://www.artofmanliness.com/?p=135323","description":"<h4 id=\"pressboard-ad-sponsorship-tag\" style=\"margin-bottom: 35px;\"></h4><p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Why Are We Restless?\" src=\"https://omny.fm/shows/the-art-of-manliness/why-are-we-restless/embed\" width=\"100%\" height=\"180\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Most everyone has experienced restlessness from time to time. A feeling of wanting more, but being unsure of how to find it; of struggling with distraction, but being unsure of what to focus on; of striking out in various directions, but not feeling any more fulfilled.</p>\n<p>While we tend to think of restlessness as a very modern phenomenon, a French diplomat and philosopher, Alexis de Tocqueville, observed the very same problems in America two centuries ago. And the roots of our restlessness go back even further still.</p>\n<p>My guests today will trace some of these genealogical branches for us. Their names are Benjamin and Jenna Storey, they’re a married couple, professors of political philosophy, and the authors of the book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0691211124/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=0691211124&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess&#38;linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\"><em>Why We Are Restless: On the Modern Quest for Contentment</em></a>.</p>\n<p>We begin our conversation with how the Storeys’ inquiry into restlessness began from observing existential meltdowns in their students and a constant but unfulfilling busyness in their friends. The Storeys then explain how Tocqueville observed a similar phenomenon at the start of the 19th century, before digging into two of the philosophers Tocqueville’s observations were shaped by: Michel de Montaigne and Blaise Pascal. They first unpack Montaigne’s ideal of living a life of cool, nonchalant, existential indifference, which sought contentment in the here and now, and then discuss Pascal’s critique of that philosophy, in which he argued that seeking diversion and distraction for its own sake only makes us miserable, and that humans must engage in an anguished search for something beyond ourselves. We then explore what happened in the West when Montaigne’s approach to life was adopted by the masses, and how it’s led to feelings of existential failure, an impossible search for constant happiness, envy, loneliness, and acrimonious political debates. At the end of our conversation, the Storeys argue that while restlessness can never be entirely extinguished, it can be tamed, and suggest a few ways on how.</p>\n<p><em>If reading this in an email, click the title of the post to listen to the show.</em></p>\n<h3>Show Highlights</h3>\n<ul><li>Is our existential restlessness a modern phenomenon?</li>\n<li>How restlessness manifested in early America</li>\n<li>How Montaigne’s essays shaped our view of happiness</li>\n<li>What does Pascal have to say about Montaigne and human flourishing?</li>\n<li>How did Tocqueville democratize happiness (and unhappiness)?</li>\n<li>Why it’s so hard to know how we measure up </li>\n<li>How diversions have become nearly religious  </li>\n<li>What happens when we lose a common language </li>\n<li>Is there a solution to this restlessness? </li>\n<li>The importance of saying no </li>\n</ul><h3>Resources/Articles/People Mentioned in Podcast</h3>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/st-augustine-philosophy/\">St. Augustine’s Real-World Spirituality for Restless Hearts</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/a-simple-cure-for-restlessness-work-when-you-work-play-when-you-play/\">A Simple Cure for Restlessness</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/paradox-of-choice/\">Limiting Your Choices</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/modern-neurasthenia-curing-your-restlessness/\">Modern “Neurasthenia”: Curing Your Restlessness</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/finding-an-existential-second-wind/\">Finding an Existential Second Wind</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/podcast-476-are-modern-people-the-most-exhausted-in-history/\">Are Modern People the Most Exhausted in History?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0226805360/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=0226805360&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess&#38;linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\"><em>Democracy in America</em></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/podcast-635-the-existentialists-survival-guide/\">The Existentialist’s Survival Guide</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/sources-of-existential-angst/\">Sources of Existential Angst</a></li>\n<li>Montaigne’s <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3dyoei2\"><em>Essays</em></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/the-virtuous-life-moderation/\">The Virtuous Life: Moderation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001F4UHEE/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=B001F4UHEE&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess&#38;linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\"><em>American Beauty</em></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/sunday-firesides-want-a-good-life-just-dont-do-stupid-stuff/\">Want a Good Life?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/relationships-family/\">Men and Status (series)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2G9iFGr\"><em>After Virtue</em></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-firmly-say-no-without-coming-off-like-a-jerk/\">How to Say No Without Coming Off Like a Jerk</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/case-for-tech-sabbath-aaron-edelheit/\">The Case for the 24/6 Lifestyle</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0374529752/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=0374529752&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess&#38;linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\"><em>The Sabbath</em></a> by Abraham Heschel</li>\n</ul><h3><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-135325\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/04/restless.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"354\" height=\"550\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/04/restless.jpg 1000w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/04/restless-768x1194.jpg 768w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/04/restless-988x1536.jpg 988w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/04/restless-320x498.jpg 320w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/04/restless-640x995.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 354px) 100vw, 354px\"></img></h3>\n<h3>Connect With the Storeys</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.furman.edu/academics/tocqueville-program/\">The Tocqueville Program</a></p>\n<h3>Listen to the Podcast!

Pick which option(s) work for you. </p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/newsletter/\">(FREE) Email Newsletter</a></h3>\n<p class=\"better-man\">We’ve had an email newsletter since before email newsletters were cool.</p>\n<p>And, unlike many email newsletters these days, you can get the entire text of articles in it, and it’s 100% FREE.</p>\n<p class=\"better-man\">We have two email subscription options:</p>\n<p class=\"better-man\"><b>Daily Newsletter.</b> Our daily newsletter provides the FULL text of the articles that we published the day before. You’ll get your daily newsletter every morning at 5 AM CT.</p>\n<p class=\"better-man\"><b>Weekly Digest. </b>The weekly digest is sent out every Sunday morning. It includes headlines of all the articles and podcasts that we published during the week. You can then click which articles you want to read in full. Great option if you want to limit the number of emails you get.</p>\n<p class=\"better-man\">Both our daily newsletter and weekly digest include links to archival articles and podcasts that are still relevant today. With nearly 4,000 posts in our archives, the newsletter is an easy way to discover all the timeless and evergreen content in the AoM treasury.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://feeds.feedburner.com/TheArtOfManliness\">RSS Feed</a></h3>\n<p>Read AoM like it’s 2008 all over again with RSS!</p>\n<p>RSS is a web feed that most websites have that allows you to read information from a website without actually going to the website. A lot of the internet runs on RSS feeds — you just don’t realize it. </p>\n<p>AoM has a FULL text RSS Feed. And yes, it’s FREE. You can read AoM in the RSS reader of your choice. </p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://feedly.com/\"><b>Feedly.</b></a> This is what I use.

It’s so easy that my 10-year-old was able to pick it up in a few minutes. He and I had a blast countersinking screws together the other day. Great bit of know-how to impart on a rainy afternoon.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’re ready to give your wood projects a bit of extra polish, here’s how to countersink a screw.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">How to Countersink a Screw</span></h3>\n<h3>The Easiest Way: Use a Countersink Drill Bit</h3>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-135273\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/04/countersinkbit.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"667\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/04/countersinkbit.jpg 600w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/04/countersinkbit-320x427.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\"></img></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The easiest way to countersink a screw is to buy a drill bit that drills a pilot hole and creates the countersink divot at the same time. </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3dhR9Xj\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can pick up a set for $20.</span></a></p>\n<p>Once you’ve got your countersink drill set, follow these steps:</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>1.</strong> Select the drill bit that matches up with the size of your screw.</span></p>\n<p><strong>2</strong>.

It won’t even look like you have a screw there.</span></p>\n<h3>The Second Easiest Way: Use a Separate Countersink Drill Bit</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead of using a drill bit that both drills the pilot hole and creates a countersink divot, you can opt to make a pilot hole with a regular drill bit and then swap your bit for a countersink drill bit to create the countersink. Once that’s done, switch the drill bit for a screw bit and screw in your screw.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This takes a bit more time because of the additional swapping you have to do, but it works.</span></p>\n<h3>Don’t Have a Countersink Drill Bit? Here’s How to Countersink in a Pinch</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you don’t have a countersink drill bit, you can still countersink a screw. Here’s how:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>1.</strong> Drill your pilot hole with the appropriate-sized drill bit.</span></p>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-135280\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/04/drill_small-1.jpg\" alt=\"small drill hole\" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/04/drill_small-1.jpg 600w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/04/drill_small-1-320x204.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"></img></p>\n<p><strong>2</strong>. Swap out the bit for a drill bit that’s slightly larger than your screw head. Drill a shallow divot into your pilot hole so that the screw head can sit just below the surface. </p>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-135281\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/04/drill_big.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/04/drill_big.jpg 600w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/04/drill_big-320x222.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"></img></p>\n<p><strong>3.</strong> Switch the drill bit for a screw bit and screw in your screw.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_135282\" style=\"width: 610px;  border: 1px solid #dddddd; background-color: #f3f3f3; padding: 4px; margin: 10px; text-align:center; display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-135282\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-135282 size-full\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/04/drill_finish.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/04/drill_finish.jpg 600w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/04/drill_finish-320x196.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"></img><p style=\" padding: 0 4px 5px; margin: 0;\" id=\"caption-attachment-135282\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Improvised countersink.
