Even more horrifying, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2021/03/30/982805684/new-anti-trans-legislation-passed-by-arkansas-senate\">Arkansas’s Republican-dominated legislature</a> passed a bill banning necessary trans health care for kids. And those are just the most recent examples of anti-trans legislation. Several others have <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/03/28/megan-rapinoe-transgender-kids-sports-ban/\">already become law</a>, and still more bills are winding their way through the legislature in many other states. (<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2021/03/28/981225604/its-hurtful-trans-youth-speaks-out-as-alabama-debates-banning-medical-treatment\">Alabama</a> and <a href=\"https://www.wkrn.com/news/tennessee-news/bill-to-restrict-transgender-healthcare-before-puberty-advances-out-of-tennessee-house-committee/\">Tennessee</a> are also considering banning trans health care for kids.)  </p>\n<p id=\"LCJQGI\">Others who don’t particularly care about trans lives include many right-wing pundits, smugly making easy, hacky jokes about trans women looking like big, scary men in dresses. </p>\n<p id=\"mUFrdm\">And at least some of the people who don’t care about our lives are in the media, covering issues that affect trans people without talking to actual trans people — or failing to recognize the stale arguments coughed up against us by <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/29/us/politics/transgender-girls-sports.html\">astroturfed conservative advocacy groups</a> as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/19/anti-trans-rhetoric-homophobia-trans-rights\">warmed over</a> from the days when similar arguments were made about gay men and lesbians.</p>\n<p id=\"U6Ghb4\">But none of them fundamentally care if trans people die.</p>\n<p id=\"KDOjar\">I am aware of how dramatic this sounds. I cannot see into the hearts of every single one of these people to determine the precise degree of their transphobia (though at least some of them <a href=\"https://www.dailydot.com/irl/steven-crowder-trans-gym-photos/\">don’t make any effort to hide it</a>). I am sure that if I asked them if they care about trans people dying, they would say something like, “Of course I do.” And yet they’re perfectly content to treat our existence as a ripe topic for debate.</p>\n<aside id=\"OOey3B\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"The GOP’s attack on trans kids’ health care, explained\",\"url\":\"https://www.vox.com/22360030/trans-kids-health-care-arkansas-explained\"}]}'></div></aside><p id=\"vdE5Ha\">So let me be blunt: The <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/22360030/trans-kids-health-care-arkansas-explained\">current wave of anti-trans legislation sweeping various state legislatures</a> is an attempt to ostracize trans Americans. It is an attempt to cut off our access to necessary health care. It is an attempt to kill us through the indifferent cruelty of bureaucratic measures.</p>\n<p id=\"HllGQY\">Most media attention has been focused on <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/identities/22334014/trans-athletes-bills-explained\">bills attempting to ban trans kids from playing high school sports</a>, which has been covered effectively elsewhere. My quick rebuttal: Even if we were to grant anti-trans forces their position on high school sports — the shortsighted belief that “boys” will unfairly compete on girls’ teams, where they’ll naturally dominate — it’s not clear why anyone would jump through all the hurdles of transition just to play on a <a href=\"https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/guys-i-swear-im-only-transitioning-so-i-can-cheat-at-girls-sports\">high school girls’ basketball team</a>. It fails the common sense test. </p>\n<aside id=\"ZRkcQy\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"The massive Republican push to ban trans athletes, explained\",\"url\":\"https://www.vox.com/identities/22334014/trans-athletes-bills-explained\"}]}'></div></aside><p id=\"C7bbjG\">I’m far more concerned about even more odious bills winding their way through various legislative bodies, designed to strip hormone treatment from trans teenagers. These bills will effectively force trans teens through a puberty that will cause them immense emotional and psychological harm. Some of these teens have been living as themselves for much of their childhood, without most people in their lives even knowing they are trans. But without access to puberty blockers and hormone treatments, trans girls will develop facial hair and deep voices; trans boys will grow breasts. </p>\n<p id=\"Sg10sJ\"><a href=\"https://thehill.com/opinion/healthcare/482057-the-dangers-of-criminalizing-medical-care-for-trans-youth\">Numerous studies have shown</a> that trans teenagers are more at risk of death by suicide than their cisgender peers. A <a href=\"https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/142/4/e20174218\">2018 study by the American Academy of Pediatrics</a> found that trans boys showed a 50.8 percent rate of attempted suicide (compared to 9.8 percent for cis boys), while trans girls showed a 29.9 percent rate (compared to 17.6 percent for cis girls). Nonbinary teens reported a 41.8 percent rate and gender-questioning teens a 27.9 percent rate. </p>\n<p id=\"1vTlJh\">But when trans children receive gender-affirming health care and the support of family and peers, <a href=\"https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/145/2/e20191725.long\">their risk of death by suicide declines substantially</a>. (I don’t like to talk about it, but I spent most of my life consumed by suicidal thoughts until I began transition.) What’s more, trans children who are affirmed in their gender have <a href=\"https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/pediatrics/early/2016/02/24/peds.2015-3223.full.pdf\">less risk of anxiety and depression</a> than trans kids who are not, and <a href=\"https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2014/09/02/peds.2013-2958\">a 2014 study of trans youth</a> showed that allowing them to transition as children led to positive outcomes.</p>\n<aside id=\"08g2G8\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"The dangers of criminalizing medical care for trans youth\",\"url\":\"https://thehill.com/opinion/healthcare/482057-the-dangers-of-criminalizing-medical-care-for-trans-youth\"}]}'></div></aside><p id=\"7uRm19\">There is a reason every major American medical body recommends giving trans children the chance to transition. (<a href=\"https://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/article/suppression-puberty-transgender-children/2010-08\">Here’s an article</a> from the American Medical Association’s <em>Journal of Ethics</em> making this argument 11 years ago.) Children first transition socially — with changes to their clothing, haircut, and name. Then, with a physician’s guidance, they can block the onset of puberty in early adolescence, and finally start hormone treatment in later adolescence. </p>\n<p id=\"XM3N0j\">This method works. We have records of trans children receiving hormone treatment <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/01/trans-children-history-jules-gill-peterson-interview\">as long ago as the 1930s</a>. With this approach, trans kids can largely live lives that are indistinguishable from those of cis kids. (If you don’t believe me, consider the surprisingly large number of famous trans women who transitioned as kids, like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicole_Maines\">Nicole Maines</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Petras\">Kim Petras</a>, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Schafer\">Hunter Schafer</a>.) </p>\n<p id=\"zml5Oz\">The concept of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/2020/2/12/21075683/trans-coming-out-cost-of-womanhood-pink-tax\">“passing”</a> — a binary trans person being read as their gender, rather than as the gender they were assigned at birth — is a fraught one in trans circles, because it is too easy to use as a cudgel against those who seemingly don’t pass. But blocking trans kids’ access to puberty blockers and hormone treatments will indisputably affect their ability to pass, should that be a desired outcome for them. And that, in turn, will increase their risk of encountering transphobia and transphobic violence as adults, particularly if they are Black or brown trans women. In 2020, at least <a href=\"https://www.hrc.org/resources/violence-against-the-trans-and-gender-non-conforming-community-in-2020\">44 trans women were killed</a>, the substantial majority of whom were Black or brown trans women. That was the highest number on record to date.</p>\n<p id=\"5MnhkO\">In contrast, trans teenagers who receive the right synthetic hormones will have options when it comes to disclosing their transness. I recently met a woman who transitioned as a teenager (in the 2000s, no less), and she is simply assumed to be a cis person within her field. Nobody has ever guessed otherwise. Too many people who don’t receive those hormones will always be “the trans one” in too many rooms. </p>\n<p id=\"YoFVrh\">Trans people are a lot harder to demonize when you can’t tell who we are, when we could just be another girl on the volleyball team or another lead actor in the high school play. Clinging to the harmful stereotype of “scary man in a dress” — which is the stereotype used to prop up so much of this transphobia — all but requires making it logistically impossible for someone to transition until they are well into adulthood. (But also, be nice to someone you think is a man wearing a dress. I’ve been her, and it’s really, really scary.) </p>\n<p id=\"OiexoH\">The <a href=\"https://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/Bills/FTPDocument?path=%2FBills%2F2021R%2FPublic%2FHB1570.pdf\">Arkansas bill</a> specifically ties “gender” to reproductive organs. That move effectively defines “womanhood” as an ability to bear children, which is so self-evidently a hop, skip, and jump away from an attack on abortion rights that it should give anyone in support of those rights serious pause. </p>\n<p id=\"IyXbYc\">But even more egregious is the bill’s privileging of reproductive capacity and the idea that a presumed horror awaiting trans children as they grow to adulthood is an inability to have biological children. As an adopted person (who will likely have to adopt children herself for reasons unrelated to my transness), this particular argument waged by anti-trans forces is particularly offensive. It’s also a signal of how American society remains deeply biased in favor of cisgender heterosexuals who pair off and have children, even though we know how many queer people, of all stripes, exist within our world.</p>\n<p id=\"zIIgyA\">The arguments being advanced against trans people are the same ones used against gay and lesbian people, and they’re the same arguments that were used against women in the workforce in the 20th century, and they’re the same arguments that prop up structural racism: There is a certain way America looks, and it’s not like [insert out-group of choice]. </p>\n<p id=\"flD042\">These bills and most of the coverage of them are cis-sexist. Much of the opposition to trans people — or even the unstated icky feelings that many cis people have about us — originates in the feelings of cis parents who are trying to halt their trans kids’ transitions or the idea that a trans person might someday regret their transition and wish they could take it back. </p>\n<p id=\"FmHNEI\">It is worth exploring the sadness of cis parents and especially the depth of feeling some detransitioners have. But the humans whose lives will be most affected should be the priority here — and we must not lose sight of the fact that they are real people, not intellectual thought exercises whose existence can be defined through the inconveniences they might cause the status quo. Conversations about the intersection of cis lives with trans lives or about detransition lose all value if they are presented within a specifically cis framework, starting from a foundational belief that transness is an aberration to be avoided at all costs and otherwise pitied. We are not aberrations. Being trans is just another way to be human.</p>\n<p id=\"CZr6fJ\">There is a mistaken assumption among many cis Americans (at least the ones I talk to) that “trans people” equal folks like me — relatively affluent white trans women who transitioned as adults, seemingly on a whim, and now won’t stop talking about it. But the <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/transgender-americans-are-more-likely-to-be-unemployed-and-poor-127585\">majority of trans Americans</a> are working class or come from working-class families. Many of us are <a href=\"https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/publications/race-ethnicity-trans-adults-us/\">not white</a>. Most of us are <a href=\"https://news.vanderbilt.edu/2020/04/13/transgender-americans-experience-significant-economic-health-challenges-study/\">barely scraping by</a>. </p>\n<p id=\"bKfWEe\">The extremely thin social safety net that bears us up in the United States is, shockingly, one of the better ones for trans people. That’s only because the world is so weighted toward cis people that there are <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/12/23/22175866/transgender-quarantine-trans-woman-lost-year-sophie-coming-out\">disastrously few places</a> where trans people can find the care we need. That social safety net isn’t just worth preserving; it’s vital, as is creating better access to trans health care for all trans Americans. </p>\n<aside id=\"D5eDDU\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"The Lost Year: A new dress, new self-acceptance, and a sudden onset of the soul \",\"url\":\"https://www.vox.com/2020/12/23/22175866/transgender-quarantine-trans-woman-lost-year-sophie-coming-out\"}]}'></div></aside><p id=\"zEPaJ7\">But I am a relatively affluent white woman who transitioned as an adult, and I have a media platform, and I’m not going to stop talking about it. Saw away at the social safety net, and trans people — lots of us — will die. It is that simple, and it is worth thinking about whether that blood is worth so many hypotheticals that turn us into imagined monsters rather than people just trying to survive another day in a country that increasingly doesn’t care whether we live.</p>\n<p id=\"KEJxLQ\">Those who question the stories of trans people — especially trans youth — rob us of our autonomy to define our lives. They argue, sometimes implicitly and sometimes explicitly, that cis people are the true arbiters of who we are. They suggest that when trans people advocate for our interests, both as individuals and as a community, we are being selfish, naïve, and uncompromising. But it is not selfish to say you have a self, it is not naïve to believe that you know that self better than others, and it is not uncompromising to insist that you should live a life of dignity the same as anybody else. </p>\n<p id=\"wJj10D\">Every day that cis people guide most of the conversations about trans people is a day that further suggests our lives are not worth living as they are. But if our lives are what we say they are, and if they are not worth living as they are, what are you trying to tell us? Where would you have us go? Answer that question. I’m waiting. </p>\n\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 02 Apr 2021 14:30:00 +0000","feedId":99,"bgimg":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mqBzbR46Uo0w2IqtmtTB6caG_2w=/0x50:3004x2303/1310x983/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69066321/1232024441.0.jpg","linkMd5":"1f76c8bcb5de6a8ff170bbdb575a5023","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn31@2020_2/2021/04/03/04-50-08-021_a26ef7bc3cd249ee.webp","destWidth":1310,"destHeight":983,"sourceBytes":275857,"destBytes":233114,"author":"Emily VanDerWerff","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mqBzbR46Uo0w2IqtmtTB6caG_2w=/0x50:3004x2303/1310x983/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69066321/1232024441.0.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn31@2020_2/2021/04/03/04-50-08-021_a26ef7bc3cd249ee.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617425407675},{"createdTime":"2021-04-03 12:50:07","updatedTime":"2021-04-03 12:50:07","title":"Biden’s $2 trillion infrastructure plan, explained in 600 words","link":"https://www.vox.com/2021/4/2/22364100/biden-human-infrastructure-jobs-plan","description":"  \n\n    <figure>\n      <img alt=\"President Joe Biden speaks in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on March 31, 2021, to unveil his infrastructure proposal.\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0czOwyKtvrOx27_WpU3iy8Vs2kA=/0x0:5365x4024/1310x983/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69066871/1232046172.0.jpg\" />\n        <figcaption>President Joe Biden speaks in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on March 31 to unveil his infrastructure proposal. | Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Images</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n  <p>The proposal takes an expansive view of infrastructure.</p> <p id=\"ih4kY0\">President Joe Biden has unveiled what he called a <a href=\"https://voxcom.cmail20.com/t/d-l-qjdydjk-ssiuphk-k/\">$2 trillion infrastructure proposal</a>, the first of two parts of his “Build Back Better” agenda. And one thing is clear: The plan takes an expansive view of what “infrastructure” means.</p>\n<p id=\"PW3qaq\">The plan includes about $621 billion for roads and bridges, the single biggest item in Biden’s plan. Another $165 billion would go toward public transportation, with a big chunk of that going to Amtrak. It would also pay for electric car recharging stations, water systems (including eliminating all lead pipes), high-speed broadband infrastructure, building and retrofitting homes and other buildings, plugging oil and gas wells, and modernizing the electrical grid — all stuff that could fit into a traditional definition of “infrastructure.”</p>\n<p id=\"Rw1RO8\">But then the proposal gets more creative with the term.</p>\n<p id=\"ZEDYqG\">Biden’s plan calls for expanding Medicaid coverage of caregiving services for the elderly and people with disabilities, which includes a portion to improve benefits and pay for caregivers. It also would put more money into schools and child care services. And it includes support for job training, violence prevention programs, military veterans’ hospitals, pandemic preparedness, and new research, including for technologies to confront global warming.</p>\n<p id=\"dwaAaQ\">One of the parts of the proposal calls on Congress to pass another bill entirely: the <a href=\"https://voxcom.cmail20.com/t/d-l-qjdydjk-ssiuphk-u/\">Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act</a>, a sweeping pro-union bill.</p>\n<div class=\"c-float-right\"><div id=\"kh8VY7\"><div data-anthem-component=\"aside:10296380\"></div></div></div>\n<p id=\"aLEpYi\">All of this almost certainly sounds good to progressives, covering issues from <a href=\"https://voxcom.cmail20.com/t/d-l-qjdydjk-ssiuphk-o/\">climate change</a> to child and elder care. But it doesn’t fit the steel-and-concrete mold of infrastructure that American politicians, including former President Barack Obama, have talked about in the past few years when they talk about infrastructure proposals.</p>\n<p id=\"baGbtq\">Instead, Biden’s team is in effect arguing for “human infrastructure” — a term progressives <a href=\"https://voxcom.cmail20.com/t/d-l-qjdydjk-ssiuphk-b/\">have used</a> a lot recently to refer to health care, education, and other services that are a key part of the modern economy. The concept goes back decades, with earlier references in <a href=\"https://voxcom.cmail20.com/t/d-l-qjdydjk-ssiuphk-n/\">academic work</a>. But nowadays it’s been cited by everyone from the <a href=\"https://voxcom.cmail20.com/t/d-l-qjdydjk-ssiuphk-p/\">Brookings Institution</a> think tank to <a href=\"https://voxcom.cmail20.com/t/d-l-qjdydjk-ssiuphk-x/\">Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT)</a> as a way to get Americans and policymakers to take a broader view of the kinds of things we can spend money on to build.</p>\n<p id=\"NZlczl\">The idea: The US already spends a lot of money on roads, bridges, and other traditional infrastructure projects — and for good reason, because these are things people need to simply get around and get to work. But day-to-day life and work in the US require other kinds of infrastructure, too. And governments can build to support it, from high-speed internet services (considered a part of typical infrastructure plans) to child care (which usually isn’t).</p>\n<p id=\"nPdXXC\">So “human infrastructure” is about building up the structures that can help boost the economy and let people participate in it. One way to look at it: These projects are what allow people to take advantage of more traditional infrastructure projects. Someone isn’t going to be able to use that road or bridge to get to work if she has to stay home to take care of her kids or parents.</p>\n<p id=\"i4bB9U\">Politics, of course, plays a role in the very full plan. With Democrats holding only a slim majority in Congress, they’re forced to pass bills in the Senate through a <a href=\"https://voxcom.cmail20.com/t/d-l-qjdydjk-ssiuphk-m/\">“reconciliation” process</a> that lets a simple majority bypass the filibuster and approve legislation. But historically, that process can only be used to get one bill across each year. So Democrats looking to get more done in a short period — particularly before the 2022 midterm elections — have sought ways to cram more progressive priorities into bills.</p>\n<p id=\"x44MNh\">The concept of “human infrastructure,” then, may let Biden and other Democrats get more stuff done than they could have otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"lySuzk\">For more on Biden’s infrastructure plan, read <a href=\"https://voxcom.cmail20.com/t/d-l-qjdydjk-ssiuphk-c/\">Ella Nilsen’s explainer at Vox</a>.</p>\n\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 02 Apr 2021 16:00:00 +0000","feedId":99,"bgimg":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0czOwyKtvrOx27_WpU3iy8Vs2kA=/0x0:5365x4024/1310x983/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69066871/1232046172.0.jpg","linkMd5":"94570df0fa91601957b1be8252f8bd4c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn36@2020_6/2021/04/03/04-50-07-947_ec09549df7bfd93e.webp","destWidth":1310,"destHeight":983,"sourceBytes":114551,"destBytes":69720,"author":"German Lopez","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0czOwyKtvrOx27_WpU3iy8Vs2kA=/0x0:5365x4024/1310x983/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69066871/1232046172.0.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn36@2020_6/2021/04/03/04-50-07-947_ec09549df7bfd93e.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617425407671},{"createdTime":"2021-04-03 12:50:07","updatedTime":"2021-04-03 12:50:07","title":"The fallout from the Suez Canal ship is coming to a store near you","link":"https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2021/4/2/22364278/suez-canal-ship-effects-ever-given-supply-chain","description":"  \n\n    <figure>\n      <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/up9nvC9kr-7_q6uakRTGPP6F1hw=/304x0:5168x3648/1310x983/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69067658/GettyImages_1232014710.0.jpg\" />\n        <figcaption>The Ever Given is free, but the supply chain will be feeling its effects for a long time. | Xinhua/Wang Dongzhen via Getty Images</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n  <p>The Ever Given isn’t stuck anymore, but it will delay tea, dildos, and more.</p> <p id=\"KKy2Lk\">When a ship as long as the Empire State Building is tall got lodged diagonally across the Suez Canal on March 23, it provided immediate and exceptional <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2021/3/24/22348186/ship-stuck-suez-canal-blocked-ever-given-memes\">meme fodder</a>. This mammoth symbol of the hubris of capitalism, ran aground by a windy day — like a modern-day Titanic, if all the passengers were giant metal boxes, no one died, and everyone was on Twitter.</p>\n<p id=\"g5UnX8\">For the logistics industry, though, the canal blockage was just the latest and most visible manifestation of the relentless cascade of problems created — or at least catalyzed by — the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>\n<p id=\"vaIMH8\">“It’s really just another example of how crazy things have been over the past year,” says Eytan Buchman, chief marketing officer of the online freight marketplace Freightos.</p>\n<p id=\"12wbZB\">Even before the 220,000-ton Ever Given got stuck, global supply chains were facing a laundry list of stressors, from skyrocketing prices and container shortages to port congestion and unrelenting consumer demand. </p>\n<div class=\"c-float-right\"><div id=\"SbtKCp\"><div data-anthem-component=\"aside:9574455\"></div></div></div>\n<p id=\"r6M0Ok\">For the average shopper, most of these pressures have only been noticeable when they’ve gone to buy a couch or fix their washing machine and been met with <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-goods/21509105/back-order-furniture-heat-lamps-appliances-supply-chain\">months of delays</a>. But as the pandemic drags on and the problems continue — now exacerbated by a very big ship that, in six days, held up nearly <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-25/suez-snarl-seen-halting-9-6-billion-a-day-worth-of-ship-traffic\">$60 billion in global trade</a> — there are signs that we may eventually feel the crunch in our checkout carts, too.</p>\n<p id=\"8ltY4O\">“Rather than a very sexy explosion in prices overnight or a total lack of capacity, you’ll see a very, very long and drawn-out death by 1,000 small changes over the next couple of months or weeks,” says Buchman. </p>\n<p id=\"K8xCiw\">By the time the Ever Given was refloated on March 29, more than 350 container ships were waiting to pass through the canal. In the coming days and weeks, those ships will all descend on ports at the same time — an effect that will be felt first in Europe and later on the East Coast of the US, where many of the ships are scheduled to stop before returning to Asia. </p>\n<p id=\"HkLCVj\">“There will be more congestion and more ships that are stuck waiting, and then there will be a knock-on effect where it’ll be harder to get those same ships back to Asia,” thereby exacerbating existing container and commodity shortages, says Buchman.</p>\n<p id=\"dHWRIC\">For a sense of just how much stuff was left idling in the ocean as workers tried to free the stuck ship, Jett McCandless, CEO of the supply chain visibility company Project44, likened the cargo to the contents of nearly 900,000 two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartments. </p>\n<p id=\"2EqzS4\">So while ports and terminals are no doubt working overtime to deal with the surge of ships that is set to arrive, he says, “when it comes to transportation supply chains, this really is a physical world. So just like there’s a traffic jam during rush hour because there’s only so many cars you can drive down a big highway, [at ports], there’s only so many trucks, there’s only so many people with cranes.”</p>\n<div class=\"c-float-right\"><aside id=\"O3WQ89\"><q>“There’s only so many trucks, there’s only so many people with cranes”</q></aside></div>\n<p id=\"76Qgnq\">Because of the scale and complexity of these supply chains — and because massive ships and the steel containers they carry aren’t the kind of thing you can scale up overnight — there’s little chance of these problems easing anytime soon.</p>\n<p id=\"4U255H\">“People should get comfortable waiting,” says McCandless. </p>\n<p id=\"ESLoQu\">Much of the surge in demand for products like bicycles, furniture, and home appliances has been driven by consumers’ lifestyle changes during the pandemic — as they’ve spent more time at home and less money on services like haircuts or dining out, they’ve purchased huge quantities of stuff to meet their needs.</p>\n<p id=\"nrXD4X\">The ripple effects of this spending shift are everywhere: Peloton <a href=\"https://investor.onepeloton.com/static-files/dd43f8b8-acc9-443a-bc51-fd26433ec549\">said in February</a> that it planned to spend more than $100 million this quarter to expedite shipping for its exercise bikes and treadmills, opting to pay as much as 10 times more to ship the products by air rather than deal with ocean freight delays. In March, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/09/business/costco-cheese-ports-backlog/index.html\">Costco reported shortages</a> of imported cheese, olive oil, and lawn equipment, among other merchandise, which it attributed to backlogged ports. Nike, Urban Outfitters, Crocs, and Yeti have likewise reported inventory issues in recent months.</p>\n<p id=\"CuNsGs\">Cardboard boxes are also <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/corrugated-boxes-have-never-been-in-more-demandor-more-expensive-11617189646\">more expensive than ever</a> thanks to the boom in online ordering, prompting producers to shift away from paper production in order to focus on churning out material for boxes.   </p>\n<p id=\"vtBCAF\">And with a $1.9 trillion stimulus bill passing last month, consumer spending seems likely to continue — provided there are, in fact, goods on the shelf. US retailers reported record-low inventory levels relative to sales in January, according to the <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/RETAILIRSA\">most recent data</a> from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, even as consumer-goods imports <a href=\"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/imports-to-set-new-monthly-records-from-now-into-the-summer\">reached a record high</a>.</p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ox6FIHJSDNhS7L--Z5TKFbOE2ts=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22416441/GettyImages_1232019342.jpg\">\n      <cite>Sayed Hassan/picture alliance via Getty Images</cite>\n      <figcaption>Ships sail through the Suez Canal as traffic resumes after the Ever Given container ship was freed.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"uq50iB\">“If demand in Western countries continues like it has for the last nine months, these disruptions will go into 2022,” says McCandless.</p>\n<p id=\"UOLWZn\">What might eventually rein in consumers’ appetites is higher prices, he says. Already, some companies have begun passing along a portion of their higher shipping costs to consumers — and those that haven’t are likely considering it, especially if investors are pushing them for higher profits or if they simply don’t have the capital to absorb the costs themselves. </p>\n<p id=\"bXlHyx\">In January, Freightos surveyed 901 small- to medium-sized importers and found that 77 percent experienced supply chain difficulties over the past six months; of that group, 44 percent raised their prices as a result. Unlike big-box stores, these companies have little negotiating power with carriers and suppliers and have therefore been hit even harder by shipping costs and delays — yet another way the pandemic’s effects are being disproportionately borne by the little guys (even if, in this case, the “little guys” still bring in millions in revenue).</p>\n<p id=\"sNEpuU\">Given that these problems are so widespread, it will be hard to pinpoint which price increases can be attributed to the Suez blockage when they arrive — though coffee seems to be one category that could see a direct impact. As <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-25/your-instant-coffee-may-soon-be-at-risk-from-suez-blockage\">Bloomberg reports</a>, containers of robusta coffee — used in Nescafé and other instant coffees — were among the delayed cargo, and the canal supports almost all of the coffee beans that Europe imports. </p>\n<p id=\"wwxwao\">It’s hard to know what other goods were on the delayed ships, exactly, since that information isn’t part of the vessels’ public data, but experts say it’s just about every category of product.</p>\n<p id=\"vu82AH\">“Name a brand, and it would be unusual if they don’t have something impacted by this,” says McCandless. </p>\n<p id=\"g0R5kc\">So far, the companies that have reported having shipments held up range from Ikea to heavy-equipment maker <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/caterpillar-expects-shipment-delays-due-to-suez-canal-blockage-2021-3\">Caterpillar</a>, potentially setting back building construction alongside home-improvement projects. A tea maker with 80 containers of tea onboard several vessels <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/29/ikea-furniture-tea-and-french-oak-goods-held-up-by-suez-canal-blockage\">called the situation “chaos,”</a> while a Dutch sex toy company <a href=\"https://www.rtvnoord.nl/nieuws/802698/Dildo-s-en-vibrators-zitten-vast-voor-Suezkanaal-erotiekgroothandel-EDC-lijdt-miljoenenverlies\">bemoaned the late arrival</a> of 20 containers filled with dildos, vibrators, and other merchandise.</p>\n<div class=\"c-float-left\"><aside id=\"Wp4Oux\"><q>“Name a brand, and it would be unusual if they don’t have something impacted by this”</q></aside></div>\n<p id=\"fqAdmg\">It’s not just obstructing goods on their way to stores or warehouses (or people’s bedside drawers), either. There are also countless raw materials, machine components, and spare parts that are made in Europe and used by US manufacturers, says Saar Yoskovitz, CEO of Augury, a company that uses AI to monitor machine health in manufacturing. </p>\n<p id=\"hQ6fFv\">“If spare machine parts are held up, manufacturers may be facing stalled production lines due to machine downtime,” he says. “At the same time, many manufacturers that are running low on raw materials, or are out completely, will need to ramp up production once backlogged materials or components arrive to meet demand.”</p>\n<p id=\"7KQOi6\">He points to one of the great supply chain incidents of our time — <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2020/4/3/21206942/toilet-paper-coronavirus-shortage-supply-chain\">the great toilet paper shortage of 2020</a> — as a prime example of this: Wood pulp was one of the materials that was severely delayed.</p>\n<p id=\"sHTxSt\">As one advisory from shipping giant Maersk warned, “Even when the canal gets reopened, the ripple effects on global capacity and equipment are significant,” adding that the blockage will trigger “a series of further disruptions and backlogs in global shipping that could take weeks, possibly months, to unravel.”</p>\n<p id=\"nwzH70\"></p>\n\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 02 Apr 2021 17:50:00 +0000","feedId":99,"bgimg":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/up9nvC9kr-7_q6uakRTGPP6F1hw=/304x0:5168x3648/1310x983/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69067658/GettyImages_1232014710.0.jpg","linkMd5":"fa5d4aa729d7f899ac045ca5eda043ce","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn50@2020_3/2021/04/03/04-50-07-998_3ccc2156375a5f18.webp","destWidth":1310,"destHeight":983,"sourceBytes":222446,"destBytes":206260,"author":"Hilary George-Parkin","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/up9nvC9kr-7_q6uakRTGPP6F1hw=/304x0:5168x3648/1310x983/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69067658/GettyImages_1232014710.0.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn50@2020_3/2021/04/03/04-50-07-998_3ccc2156375a5f18.webp","https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ox6FIHJSDNhS7L--Z5TKFbOE2ts=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22416441/GettyImages_1232019342.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn59@2020_4/2021/04/03/04-50-09-891_6f1d3de625171995.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617425407669},{"createdTime":"2021-04-03 12:50:07","updatedTime":"2021-04-03 12:50:07","title":"Here’s how Biden’s infrastructure plan could get passed through Congress","link":"https://www.vox.com/22361959/biden-infrastructure-jobs-plan-congress","description":"  \n\n    <figure>\n      <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/j8L0dYLbLxNh1eKtKDLEUbL1N6c=/0x0:4439x3329/1310x983/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69067089/1232057889.0.jpg\" />\n        <figcaption>Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, right, looks on as US President Joe Biden speaks briefly to reporters at the start of a cabinet meeting in the East Room of the White House on April 1, 2021, in Washington, DC. | Drew Angerer/Getty Images</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n  <p>The three scenarios for how Biden’s $2 trillion infrastructure plan could become law, explained.</p> <p id=\"TfZeTK\">With the first part of President Joe Biden’s <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2021/3/31/22357179/biden-two-trillion-infrastructure-jobs-plan-explained\">$2 trillion jobs and infrastructure plan</a> officially released, Congress has a massive priority set for the rest of the summer.</p>\n<p id=\"bG2e8I\">Whereas Biden’s $1.9 trillion Covid-19 stimulus plan moved relatively quickly through the Democratically controlled<strong> </strong>Congress, getting infrastructure and the accompanying tax plan the White House proposed through the House and Senate will be no easy feat. The wide-ranging list of priorities — hundreds of billions for roads, bridges, ports, and rail; $300 billion to bolster manufacturing; plus money for research and development, clean energy and climate resilience, affordable housing, and more — could be transformational to American society if it gets through Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"VhmdNU\">The consensus among many on Capitol Hill is that Democratic leadership and the Biden administration will once again use <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/22242476/senate-filibuster-budget-reconciliation-process\">budget reconciliation</a> to pass a large bill with 51 votes in the narrowly divided Senate, due to mounting Republican opposition to their proposed tax plan to pay for infrastructure.</p>\n<p id=\"Qpqo3m\">“That package that they’re putting together now, as much as we would like to address infrastructure, is not going to get support from our side. Because I think the last thing the economy needs right now is a big, whopping tax increase,” Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2021/04/01/mcconnell-gop-supoort-biden-spending-478829\">told reporters</a> this week.</p>\n<p id=\"fnFU6g\">Biden had a feisty response to McConnell on Friday, telling reporters that “asking corporate America to pay their fair share will not slow the economy; it will make the economy function better.”</p>\n<p id=\"3xqh86\">“If the Republicans decide we need it but they’re not going to pay for it, it’s just going to increase the deficit,” Biden said. “I think the Republican voters are going to have a lot to say about whether we get a lot of this done.”</p>\n<div class=\"c-float-right\"><div id=\"vwv22Q\"><div data-anthem-component=\"aside:10296380\"></div></div></div>\n<p id=\"q843HT\">Even if Democrats are hoping to use budget reconciliation, some lawmakers like key swing vote Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia are holding out hope for a bipartisan effort — one of a couple other possibilities. </p>\n<p id=\"89Xtv0\">Going forward, there are three main scenarios for how Democrats could plausibly pass an infrastructure and jobs package, including the $2 trillion <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/03/31/fact-sheet-the-american-jobs-plan/\">American Jobs Plan Biden</a> released this week, and a forthcoming second plan focused on child care, health care, and other priorities. Let’s walk through them.</p>\n<h3 id=\"nY1pIG\">The three scenarios to pass Biden’s infrastructure plan, explained</h3>\n<p id=\"3D1uRM\">At the top, it’s worth noting that it’s still very early, and a lot could — and probably will — change between now and when Biden’s plan is officially introduced in the US House as a bill. Then, there will be rounds of negotiations between the House and Senate to get to a final product. </p>\n<p id=\"5ePK3f\">But until we know more, here are the rough scenarios for how Biden’s $2 trillion infrastructure bills could become law.</p>\n<h4 id=\"assSOB\">Scenario 1</h4>\n<p id=\"zWEnAX\">Democrats lump everything together in one budget reconciliation bill. Budget reconciliation, an arcane procedural tool in the Senate, allows the majority party to bypass the 60-vote threshold of the Senate filibuster and pass certain kinds of bills on a simple majority.</p>\n<p id=\"2Ot20J\">As the name suggests, budget reconciliation can only be used for things that impact the federal budget. As <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/22242476/senate-filibuster-budget-reconciliation-process\">Vox’s Dylan Scott has previously explained</a>, each budget resolution is able to set up three bills, though they are typically lumped together in one large package, meaning lawmakers usually have one chance to use budget reconciliation every fiscal year: </p>\n<blockquote><p id=\"f0dr9S\">The budget resolution can, in theory, set up three separate reconciliation bills: one for taxes, one for spending, and one for the federal debt limit. However, in practice, most reconciliation bills have combined taxes and spending into a single piece of legislation. That’s the reason that, historically, the Senate has usually been limited to passing only one budget reconciliation bill in a given fiscal year.</p></blockquote>\n<p id=\"2cr2gq\">Since Democrats already used the 2021 fiscal year budget reconciliation bill to pass Biden’s Covid-19 relief bill, the American Rescue Plan, this one would be<strong> </strong>for the 2022 fiscal year.<strong> </strong></p>\n<p id=\"kMPAoY\">Under this scenario, Democrats will still have to wait for Biden’s second proposed plan dealing with child care and health care to drop, and see how much of both bills they can write into a budget reconciliation plan for fiscal year 2022. Of course, not everything that’s in Biden’s initial proposal will be able to pass through budget reconciliation, so things are subject to change. Just as she did when deciding about minimum wage, Senate parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough can determine exactly what can be in a budget reconciliation bill and what can’t. </p>\n<p id=\"0cBbZk\">Remember, only things that affect federal spending and revenue can be passed via reconciliation. So while Democrats could certainly pass tax changes and big chunks of an infrastructure bill via reconciliation, things in the proposed package like a clean energy and electricity standard may be harder to get past the parliamentarian.</p>\n<h4 id=\"IBLauP\">Scenario 2</h4>\n<p id=\"doSoAP\">In this scenario, Democrats theoretically could be able to pass multiple budget reconciliation bills — thereby giving themselves more options to pass Biden’s massive jobs plan in parts, or lump more things into budget reconciliation. </p>\n<p id=\"EIY7hT\">Arguing in front of the parliamentarian, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer’s team is trying to make the case that Democrats should be able to pass up to three budget reconciliation bills this calendar<strong> </strong>year. Specifically, aides are pushing for a second bill tied to fiscal year 2021<strong> </strong>by citing an arcane rule that hasn’t been used before — Section 304 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.</p>\n<p id=\"mjwNwy\">As Vox’s Li Zhou and I reported recently:</p>\n<blockquote><p id=\"naOVUn\">Per Section 304 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, budget resolutions can be revised if they’re updated before the end of the fiscal year that they cover: If Democrats’ argument stands, for instance, they could go back and amend the resolution for the 2021 fiscal year, and include instructions for another reconciliation bill. Any new legislation could theoretically focus on Democratic priorities that the original bill — which contained <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2021/3/5/22315614/covid-19-stimulus-bill-economic-relief-coronavirus-pandemic\"><strong>$1.9 trillion in coronavirus aid</strong></a> — didn’t include.</p></blockquote>\n<p id=\"ER9WxR\">The Senate parliamentarian could rule on this as soon as Friday. If MacDonough agrees and lets them amend the fiscal year 2021 budget resolution, Democrats could theoretically break Biden’s infrastructure plan and his forthcoming child care and health care plan into two different reconciliation bills — sticking one in the amended 2021 resolution and putting the rest in the 2022 resolution. It gives them more options and chances to use reconciliation to pass their priorities with 51 votes.</p>\n<h4 id=\"SsC3cO\">Scenario 3</h4>\n<p id=\"fkimgA\">In this scenario, Democrats and Republicans would work together to at least pass a bipartisan surface transportation reauthorization bill, which comes up every five years. Relevant House and Senate committees are currently working on this reauthorization bill, as well as a water infrastructure bill. </p>\n<p id=\"2bGMOB\">Then, Democrats could still use reconciliation to pass the remaining elements of Biden’s infrastructure and jobs plan.</p>\n<p id=\"3ienCp\">The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee has proposed around a $500 billion reauthorization bill, and while the Senate Committee on Environment and Health is still working out its topline number, it’s expected to be close to that House figure. The five-year reauthorization bills deal pretty narrowly with fixing up roads and bridges, and Republicans on the committees think the reauthorization bill should be worked on and passed in a bipartisan way. </p>\n<p id=\"0fKZgB\">“Our committee unanimously reported legislation to rebuild our nation’s water systems. This proves that infrastructure can and should be done on a bipartisan basis,” Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), the ranking member of the Senate Committee on Environment and Health, said in a recent statement.</p>\n<p id=\"3FrHVq\">However, it’s worth noting that the White House views its plan as being passed on top of whatever Congress does on infrastructure on its own. Biden has proposed $621 billion for spending on the nation’s roads and bridges, rail and public transit, and airports and ports.</p>\n<p id=\"bBjsKd\">“All elements of the plan reflect additional investment on top of existing programs and authorities,” an administration official told Vox. “On transportation infrastructure, the plan includes an additional roughly $600B above the five-year budget baseline, assuming a straight extension of FAST-Act funding levels for surface transportation programs.”</p>\n<p id=\"p6Gkix\">So, either Democrats and Republicans could pass a bipartisan surface transportation reauthorization and then pare down the amount set aside for surface transportation in their reconciliation bill, or they could pass around $1 trillion for surface transportation infrastructure. </p>\n<h3 id=\"oY2ub2\">Expect a busy next few months on infrastructure</h3>\n<p id=\"Q14UY8\">After Biden’s second piece of his overall jobs plan drops in the coming weeks, Congress will get to work turning it into an actual bill. The process of writing a spending bill begins in the US House, before it gets sent to the Senate and the two chambers conference to come up with a bill they can agree on. </p>\n<p id=\"BGODou\">House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Schumer already have their work cut out for them. House progressives are saying the infrastructure package should be bigger, and moderates are demanding an accompanying tax bill to reinstate the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/10/30/16557554/the-state-and-local-tax-deduction-explained\">state and local tax deduction</a> in exchange for their votes (something Pelosi told reporters she agrees with at her Thursday press conference).</p>\n<p id=\"4Y5Ygy\">Meanwhile, Republicans are saying Biden’s plan<strong> </strong>should be smaller and not come with corporate tax increases. Getting Republican support for the American Jobs Plan is looking ever more difficult, and the White House already seems to be preparing a similar argument that they had for the Covid-19 relief bill: Infrastructure is bipartisan, even if Congressional Republicans don’t support it.

Here’s why.</p> <p id=\"fgyynx\">Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer accused of killing George Floyd, is on trial right now. But Chauvin is a major outlier in a system that very rarely imposes serious criminal charges against cops for an on-duty shooting or killing.</p>\n<p id=\"sIy9wz\">Take shootings, for which Chauvin is not accused of, but for which we have the best data: Since 2005, 139 police officers have been arrested for murder or manslaughter due to an on-duty shooting, according to data from Philip Matthew Stinson, a criminal justice expert at Bowling Green State University who has been tracking the data for years. That amounts to fewer than nine prosecutions a year.</p>\n<p id=\"3dagc2\"><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/investigations/police-shootings-database/\">About 1,000 fatal police shootings</a> are reported each year in the US — so the arrest rate is around 1 percent, never higher than 2 percent. Some, perhaps most, shootings are justified. But the number of police officers prosecuted “seems extremely low to me,” Stinson told me. “In my opinion, it’s got to be that more of the fatal shootings are unjustified.”</p>\n<p id=\"Iu8gtC\">Of those 139 officers, just 44 were convicted (with 42 cases still pending). Many of those convictions came on lesser charges: Just seven officers have been convicted of murder in police shootings since 2005, with their prison sentences ranging from 81 months to life. The remaining 37 were convicted on charges ranging from manslaughter to official misconduct, in some cases serving no prison time.</p>\n<div class=\"c-float-right\"><div id=\"oiMlaC\"><div data-anthem-component=\"aside:10296380\"></div></div></div>\n<p id=\"kxTU4f\">After the police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, in August 2014, as the Black Lives Matter movement grew more prominent, there was an uptick in prosecutions: From 2005 to 2014, about five police officers were prosecuted a year. Starting with 2015, the average is up to roughly 13 a year — meaning cops are now prosecuted in less than 2 percent of fatal shootings, up from less than 1 percent. But convictions haven’t increased much yet.</p>\n<p id=\"e58neN\">Still, even the cases that result in charges are a tiny fraction of fatal police shootings. “It’s very low,” Stinson said. As for the increase in prosecution numbers: “I don’t see systemic change.”</p>\n<p id=\"O270IA\">Many social and legal factors contribute to the low rates of charges and convictions. Cops, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/7/7/21293259/police-racism-violence-ideology-george-floyd\">under cultural pressure</a>, actively protect each other, making it more difficult at virtually every step to investigate a fatal police shooting as an illegal act. Prosecutors face conflicts of interest, as they risk aggravating police departments they work closely with by pursuing charges. The public is skeptical of second-guessing police in tense situations. And the law gives police wide latitude to use force.</p>\n<h3 id=\"P5nLid\">Police are protected by social and legal forces</h3>\n<p id=\"nmDZCd\">There’s a standard process for what happens after a murder. Police gather evidence of a crime, collecting physical materials as well as rounding up and talking to witnesses. Then prosecutors use that evidence to put together a case for court. A suspect can at that point make a deal and plead guilty, or take the case to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"RRqx8g\">For a police shooting, things work differently. That’s in part because many police shootings are justified, dealing with a suspect who was a serious threat. But there’s also a confluence of social and legal forces that protect cops at every step, from investigation to prosecution to trial, even if they actually were in the wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"XqETwY\">“Everything is done different” than in a standard murder, Stinson said. “It makes it difficult for prosecutors to figure it out and to make a rational decision, an informed decision, in terms of charging.”</p>\n<p id=\"QvSpgK\">For one, cops might resist treating a police killing as a crime and refuse to gather evidence. They could follow what’s known as the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/16/weekinreview/the-unwritten-code-that-stops-police-from-speaking.html\">“blue wall of silence,”</a> essentially a code between officers that they won’t snitch on each other or otherwise try to get each other in trouble. The most obvious effect of this is that cops, who are often the closest witnesses to a fatal shooting, won’t give a full, truthful account if it puts their colleagues in danger. Right away, that eliminates the most likely witnesses — fellow officers — to treating a police killing as a potential crime.</p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/POYVSeW3fFnjkEjpQt729Ddww8U=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22160567/GettyImages_660662684t.jpg\">\n      <cite>Drew Angerer/Getty Images</cite>\n      <figcaption>The newest members of the New York City Police Department (NYPD) attend their graduation ceremony at Madison Square Garden on March 30, 2017. </figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"MUMxUf\">Meanwhile, prosecutors have incentives not to push too hard. They work very closely with police departments on a day-to-day basis — it’s, again, how they get a lot of evidence for charges, trials, and convictions. If prosecutors go after the police, they risk damaging that relationship and, subsequently, making their day-to-day work a lot harder.</p>\n<p id=\"QSaWAJ\">This isn’t theoretical; prosecutors have repeatedly complained about this. Following the 2017 <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/7/17/15985442/minneapolis-police-shooting-justine-damond-video\">Minneapolis police killing of Justine Damond</a>, Hennepin County prosecutor Mike Freeman brought murder charges against the shooting officer, Mohamed Noor. Though Noor <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/07/us/minneapolis-mohamed-noor-sentenced/index.html\">was ultimately convicted and sentenced to prison</a>, it wasn’t easy. </p>\n<p id=\"HIxjMJ\">“A number of the officers, for reasons we do not understand … refused to come answer questions,” Freeman <a href=\"https://www.mprnews.org/story/2018/03/22/rights-protections-at-heart-of-spat-between-prosecutors-police\">said in 2018</a>. “I’ve been privileged to have this job nearly 18 years, I’ve never had police officers who weren’t suspects refuse to do their duty and come forward to talk to us.”</p>\n<p id=\"bG6Sug\">That’s an example of a prosecutor who actually tried pursuing the case. In many cases, prosecutors will use their discretion to not bring any charges at all. That may be because they genuinely find a police killing to be justified, or it may be because they find the case too challenging or politically risky. (In much of the US, prosecutors <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2015/5/27/8661045/prosecutors-mass-incarceration\">are elected into their positions</a>.)</p>\n<p id=\"8iG9MH\">If a case does make it to trial, a major challenge is persuading judges and juries, made up of members of the public, that a cop should be convicted. Based on Stinson’s data for officers charged with murder or manslaughter due to an on-duty shooting, just 46 percent of police with completed cases have been convicted since 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"NGB3jZ\">”There is a tendency to believe an officer over a civilian, in terms of credibility,” <a href=\"http://www.krlawphila.com/firm-attorneys/david-rudovsky/\">David Rudovsky</a>, a civil rights lawyer who co-wrote <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1516588&amp;xs=1&amp;url=http://www.amazon.com/Police-Misconduct-Litigation-Michael-Avery/dp/0836610997&amp;xcust=___vx__e_17702275__r_google.com__t_w__d_D\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Prosecuting Misconduct: Law and Litigation</em></a>, <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2014/11/25/7173695/ferguson-police-officer-prosecution\">previously told Vox</a>. “And when an officer is on trial, reasonable doubt has a lot of bite. A prosecutor needs a very strong case before a jury will say that somebody we generally trust to protect us has so seriously crossed the line as to be subject to a conviction.”</p>\n<p id=\"xSyHCP\">Stinson put it another way: People are “very reluctant to second-guess the split-second, life-or-death decisions of a police officer in a potentially violent street encounter. They just won’t do it.”</p>\n<p id=\"GDexTj\">Then there’s the actual law, which gives police wide latitude to use force. Under the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/identities/2016/8/13/17938226/police-shootings-killings-law-legal-standard-garner-graham-connor\">legal standards set by the Supreme Court</a>, police officers can be legally justified in using force if they merely perceive a threat, even if a threat isn’t there. State laws can vary, but in general the legal question comes down to whether the officer acted reasonably — in a way other officers would in similar situations, without the benefit of hindsight — which can easily be interpreted by prosecutors, judges, or juries to allow cops to use force in situations in which they didn’t really need to.</p>\n<p id=\"d7cMjz\">This is part of the problem that the state’s attorney for Baltimore, Marilyn Mosby, ran into when she prosecuted the police officers involved in the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/7/27/18089352/freddie-gray-baltimore-riots-police-violence\">2015 killing of Freddie Gray</a>. The question in trial often came down to whether the officers were acting unreasonably, which was simply too hard for Mosby to prove. Coupled with all the other problems above, Mosby found it impossible to land a conviction. As she <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/7/27/12298116/freddie-gray-marilyn-mosby-baltimore\">put it</a>, after she decided to drop the cases in 2016:</p>\n<blockquote><p id=\"G4maTo\"> After much thought and prayer, it has become clear that without being able to work with an independent investigatory agency from the very start, without having a say in the election of whether cases proceed in front of a judge or jury, without communal oversight of police in this community, without substantive reforms to the current criminal justice system, we could try this case 100 times just like it and we would still end up with the same result.</p></blockquote>\n<p id=\"OHO5f5\">That was true even for officers in a police department that the US Department of Justice found to be broken at practically every level — concluding in a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/8/10/12418428/baltimore-police-investigation-justice-department-report\">damning report</a>, “Racially disparate impact is present at every stage of BPD’s enforcement actions, from the initial decision to stop individuals on Baltimore streets to searches, arrests, and uses of force.” And it’s likely even more true for police departments that aren’t as systemically broken.</p>\n<p id=\"T59ziz\">The result: Police officers today get away without even an arrest for murder or manslaughter in more than 98 percent of fatal shootings.</p>\n<h3 id=\"72TcO7\">Policy can help, but part of the issue is cultural</h3>\n<p id=\"zV9i6J\">Fixing police accountability will require more than changing policies.</p>\n<p id=\"v0NUQ8\">Accountability for officers needs to better ingrained within police departments and prosecutors’ offices. If there’s no culture of accountability in these places, it’s going to be extremely difficult, if not impossible, for the legal system to do more to hold cops accountable. No one has a great answer for how, exactly, to make this happen. Some of that work has started with the recent push to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/8/16/20807544/william-barr-larry-krasner-philadelphia-trump-justice-department\">elect more progressive prosecutors</a>, but so far that hasn’t led to big changes across America, and it’s too early to say if it will.</p>\n<p id=\"9Ey1aU\">From a broader cultural perspective, the public needs to be more willing to question cops’ side of the story — a shift that would ultimately not just trickle down to juries but perhaps spark more systemic changes in how police departments and prosecutors’ offices function and the kinds of policies lawmakers back to hold police accountable. Again, some of that work already appears to be underway, with support for Black Lives Matter <a href=\"https://civiqs.com/results/black_lives_matter?annotations=true&amp;uncertainty=true&amp;zoomIn=true\">up compared to recent years</a>, but it’s too early to say if that’s enough so far.</p>\n<p id=\"eYDXF3\">Policy changes could help, too.</p>\n<p id=\"eoDM1K\">One potential step is repealing <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/6/3/21277104/qualified-immunity-cops-constitution-shaniz-west-supreme-court\">“qualified immunity,”</a> which shields individual officers from lawsuits. But Stinson said it has to go further: “It would be an inconvenience for officers if they had [civil] judgments against them, but it’s not a deterrent. What would deter them is seeing many other officers go to prison. That’s what it takes.”</p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x-NJVBYgEgjhhIei14eFHCEx2MU=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22160750/GettyImages_1215796055t.jpg\">\n      <cite>Stephen Maturen/Getty Images</cite>\n      <figcaption>A portrait of George Floyd hangs on a street light pole as police officers stand guard at a police precinct in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on May 27, 2020.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"rKF55U\">One common idea is to put independent prosecutors in charge of investigations of police use of force. This could help mitigate any conflict of interest between prosecutors and the police departments they work closely with on a daily basis. Some cities, counties, and states already do this, but it’s far from nationwide.</p>\n<p id=\"oqSUaB\">Another is to change the laws and rules surrounding shootings and use of force. Police departments could change their own policies, establishing clearer standards for what’s reasonable or not.</p>\n<p id=\"ZdIDiu\">Local, state, and federal lawmakers get a say here, too. Last year, for example, California lawmakers <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/08/19/752364459/new-california-law-says-police-should-kill-only-when-necessary\">required that deadly force</a> not be just “objectively reasonable” but “necessary.” While there are major questions about what “necessary” really means, experts are watching the impact of the changes over time as the new law is tested by prosecutors in court, to see if there’s a real shift in police accountability.</p>\n<p id=\"LZxG6G\">Some experts also still pin some hope on the spread of cameras. While the research on whether police-worn cameras have an impact on use of force and accountability overall is <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2017/10/25/do-body-worn-cameras-improve-police-behavior/\">very disappointing</a>, it’s hard to shake the sense that video of police shootings has at least moved the needle on how the public perceives the police. After all, it’s video of the arrest of George Floyd in Minneapolis this year that led to thousands of Black Lives Matter protests, and greater support for those protests, this summer.</p>\n<p id=\"FZh2c9\">But as Stinson said: “Even when you got good video, you don’t necessarily get a conviction out of it,” such as in the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/7/7/12116288/minnesota-police-shooting-philando-castile-falcon-heights-video\">Minnesota police killing of Philando Castile</a>. </p>\n<p id=\"PzMeTj\">Beyond police accountability, there are broader changes that could be made to otherwise reduce the number of police shootings. Better police training and policies could encourage officers to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/11/29/12989428/police-shooting-race-crime\">get into fewer situations</a> in which use of force might be necessary — essentially, remove the need for a split-second decision. More could be done to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/11/29/12989428/police-shooting-race-crime\">rebuild trust and police-community relations</a>, which could allow police to not be as guarded, and potentially aggressive, in day-to-day scenarios. America could tighten restrictions on guns, given that <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/4/9/17205256/gun-violence-us-police-shootings\">research</a> suggests that more guns lead to more police shootings as well, perhaps because police are more likely to use lethal force in situations in which they expect a gun to be present.</p>\n<p id=\"YKPJuV\">As all of these problems and solutions indicate, this won’t be an easy issue to solve. It requires a truly systemic shift, from America’s culture around policing to how the criminal justice system functions at every level. If the US wants fewer cases that result in no justice, all of that work and effort will be necessary.</p>\n\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 02 Apr 2021 15:30:23 +0000","feedId":99,"bgimg":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mUYQbcJcDj_bzF-6YLlNgymHXGY=/225x0:1576x1013/1310x983/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68508876/police_prosecution_board_1.0.jpg","linkMd5":"3339a7c9d0d9b34ef2ace3e2e0352f0f","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn43@2020_3/2021/04/03/04-50-07-973_cb379636bdf596fd.webp","destWidth":1310,"destHeight":983,"sourceBytes":221065,"destBytes":165130,"author":"German Lopez","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mUYQbcJcDj_bzF-6YLlNgymHXGY=/225x0:1576x1013/1310x983/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68508876/police_prosecution_board_1.0.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn43@2020_3/2021/04/03/04-50-07-973_cb379636bdf596fd.webp","https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/POYVSeW3fFnjkEjpQt729Ddww8U=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22160567/GettyImages_660662684t.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn76@2020_6/2021/04/03/04-50-09-902_0671f8b16c88c0eb.webp","https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x-NJVBYgEgjhhIei14eFHCEx2MU=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22160750/GettyImages_1215796055t.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn70@2020_2/2021/04/03/04-50-09-934_ce94e4ef7083a12a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617425407674},{"createdTime":"2021-04-03 12:50:07","updatedTime":"2021-04-03 12:50:07","title":"Biden’s plan to fix America’s broken internet, briefly explained","link":"https://www.vox.com/recode/22363028/biden-infrastructure-broadband-american-jobs-plan","description":"  \n\n    <figure>\n      <img alt=\"President Joe Biden speaking in front of an American flag backdrop.\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9Uo03vYrUlYoNMa5wwn2C0SgqZk=/308x0:5144x3627/1310x983/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69068291/GettyImages_1232046220.0.jpg\" />\n        <figcaption>President Biden introduces his American Jobs Plan, which includes $100 billion to expand broadband to all Americans. | Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Images</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n  <p>Biden wants $100 billion to give broadband to everyone.

It took on everything from roads, pipes, and electricity to climate change, union jobs, and inequality. </p>\n<p id=\"Y3xLh2\">It also provided $100 billion to America’s digital infrastructure, with a lofty goal of giving all Americans access to the affordable, reliable high-speed internet they need to participate in today’s economy. The plan is short on specifics for now, but the vast majority of that money will go to building out high-speed broadband connections to the millions of Americans who still don’t have them. There are also provisions about promoting competition and lowering prices. Biden called broadband internet “the new electricity,” comparing the need for a federal initiative to bring it to all Americans to the <a href=\"https://livingnewdeal.org/glossary/rural-electrification-act-1936/\">Rural Electrification Act of 1936</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"DysE9m\">If you’ve been paying attention, Biden’s focus on closing the digital divide shouldn’t be a surprise. He called for “universal broadband” during his campaign in his <a href=\"https://joebiden.com/build-back-better/\">Build Back Better plan</a>. He <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/recode/21557495/biden-fcc-digital-divide-net-neutrality-section-230\">appointed</a> Jessica Rosenworcel, who as an FCC commissioner has been championing affordable broadband internet for years, to be acting chair of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). </p>\n<p id=\"iWrFo7\">Rosenworcel’s response to Biden’s plan, by the way? “I’m all in.”</p>\n<div id=\"8EMG9l\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Broadband for 100% of us.

The exact number of Americans who <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/first-person/2020/4/9/21214105/coronavirus-internet-rural-america\">don’t have access</a> to broadband infrastructure varies depending on several factors, including the maps you use to count them and what your definition of reliable high-speed internet is. Biden put the number at 30 million. And that number doesn’t include the millions of Americans who do have access to broadband internet but can’t afford it, rendering that access meaningless. </p>\n<p id=\"ylrEif\">The affordability issue has become all the more obvious and problematic during the pandemic. Lawmakers had to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/12/23/22196354/stimulus-bill-broadband-internet\">scramble</a> to help lower-income people gain internet access through various subsidies and stimulus bills, while the FCC <a href=\"https://www.fcc.gov/keep-americans-connected\">essentially had to beg</a> internet service providers not to cut off Americans if they couldn’t afford their internet bills. Those aren’t permanent solutions, though, and they still weren’t enough for some. Biden’s plan wants to help those people, too.</p>\n<p id=\"12jmRr\">“When I say affordable, I mean it,” Biden said in a speech announcing the plan. “Americans pay too much.”</p>\n<div id=\"B8iNgB\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">High-speed internet is essential in the 21st century, but nearly 30 million Americans lack access.

The United States cannot afford to be a country of digital haves and have-nots.”</p>\n<p id=\"OKZKMd\">“President Biden’s $100 billion infrastructure plan acknowledges an important fact about broadband today — it is an essential service, like water and electricity, and our public policy should reflect that fact,” Greg Guice, government affairs director at open internet advocacy group Public Knowledge, <a href=\"https://www.publicknowledge.org/press-release/public-knowledge-hails-president-biden-for-100-billion-dollar-bid-to-make-broadband-available-and-affordable-for-all/\">said in a statement</a>. “We look forward to working with the administration and members of Congress as they seek to pass this bold initiative to close the digital divide.”</p>\n<p id=\"nAbaEO\">The <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/03/31/fact-sheet-the-american-jobs-plan/\">fact sheet</a> the Biden administration released doesn’t go into the details beyond saying how much money Biden wants to invest and, generally, what he hopes the return on that investment will be: high-speed, “future-proof” broadband access covering the entire country; more competition between providers, including municipally owned plans and co-ops; and reduced costs.</p>\n<p id=\"za7RJr\">Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SenAmyKlobuchar/status/1377401811531927559\">said</a> that the Biden plan was based on the Accessible, Affordable Internet for All Act, which she and Rep. Jim Clyburn (D-SC) introduced in their respective houses last year and <a href=\"https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/news-releases?ID=C3C8F0E4-61D4-46FE-A28A-F81A09620A5D\">reintroduced</a> last month. </p>\n<p id=\"RROZty\">That bill gives $80 billion to broadband infrastructure, requires service providers who use networks built on that infrastructure to offer affordable service plans, and provides an additional $6 billion to the Emergency Broadband Benefit program. It will also make it easier for local governments, public-private partnerships, and cooperatives to set up their own networks that could compete with traditional for-profit service providers — which, in many areas, remain consumers’ only real option.</p>\n<p id=\"4Z65iG\">“The coronavirus pandemic exposed and exacerbated many longstanding faults that must be repaired if America is to retain her greatness,” Clyburn told Recode. “In addition to repairing many of our nation’s faults, the American Jobs Plan wisely guards against the emergence of additional faults in the future.”</p>\n<p id=\"GzHcd4\">Anna Read, a senior research officer with the broadband access initiative at the Pew Charitable Trusts, told Recode that the federal government should <a href=\"https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/articles/2021/03/02/what-policymakers-can-learn-from-the-minnesota-model-of-broadband-expansion\">look to</a> <a href=\"https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/articles/2021/03/24/virginia-aims-for-universal-broadband-access-by-2028\">state</a> and local broadband access programs, which Read believes <a href=\"https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/about/news-room/opinion/2020/12/16/a-national-solution-to-the-digital-divide-starts-with-states\">will be the key</a> to implementing Biden’s vision.</p>\n<p id=\"Eyp6PO\">“States have really been leading on this issue over the last few years,” Read said. “They’ve been investing significant state dollars and expanding broadband access. ... Increasingly, states are beginning to look at the affordability question as well.”</p>\n<p id=\"W1DwlM\">While the Biden plan promises a lot, delivering it will be a different matter. Presidents Bush, Obama, and Trump all <a href=\"https://link.wired.com/view/5c927d2a3f92a40ad9bb692ddxo4h.2tez/47aae4c2\">had lofty goals</a> about connecting America. None of them delivered, and millions of Americans paid the price for that failure when the pandemic laid bare just how far behind America is.</p>\n<p id=\"vRzRip\">Scott Wallsten, president and senior fellow at the Technology Policy Institute, said there are too many unknowns at this point to say whether Biden’s plan will be the one that reverses that trend. After all, if getting everyone in America online were easy, it would have been done already. He hopes that the plan provides for experimentation and analysis to see where and why people aren’t getting online, rather than just throwing money at a problem and assuming that will solve it. He sees a lot of places where this could go wrong or be wasteful, but he said there’s reason to be optimistic, too. </p>\n<p id=\"49VQHo\">“What I think is good is that people are actually paying attention to the digital divide and its consequences in a way that they never were before,” Wallsten said. “We see the problems and the inequities and what can happen as a result ... I think, for once, those people actually really are visible.”</p>\n<p id=\"h4HF7I\">“This is a significant infrastructure challenge but it is also an affordability challenge,” Read said. “Addressing the two in tandem will be very important to closing the digital divide.”</p>\n<p id=\"bRoxfI\"><a href=\"http://www.vox.com/open-sourced\"><em>Open Sourced</em></a><em> is made possible by Omidyar Network.

It’s a deal many would like to keep alive since it severely curbs Iran’s nuclear development in exchange for sanctions relief.</p>\n<p id=\"46mN1e\">State Department spokesperson Ned Price confirmed to me that US representatives will be in attendance “to identify the issues involved in a mutual return to compliance with the JCPOA with Iran,” he said. Officials from President Joe Biden’s administration won’t speak directly to the Iranians, but they will meet the other parties.</p>\n<p id=\"VOXi68\">“The primary issues that will be discussed are the nuclear steps that Iran would need to take in order to return to compliance with the terms of the JCPOA, and the sanctions relief steps that the United States would need to take in order to return to compliance as well,” he continued, adding “we don’t anticipate an immediate breakthrough ... but we believe this is a healthy step forward.”</p>\n<p id=\"90DID9\">Analysts agree. “It’s promising that experts groups will be meeting to discuss the key issues of sanctions relief and nuclear rollback,” said Eric Brewer, an expert on Iran’s nuclear program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, DC, “but I’d caution that we’re not out of the woods yet.”</p>\n<h3 id=\"2o1IKb\">The Iran deal is on life support. This meeting may help bring it back to life.</h3>\n<p id=\"ekGUxc\">Next week’s session, first reported by the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/iran-nuclear-deal-participants-including-u-s-to-meet-in-vienna-next-week-11617361429?st=3tt7oxktuytfp7y&amp;reflink=article_copyURL_share\">Wall Street Journal</a>, is a big deal and comes after months of posturing by Washington and Tehran.</p>\n<p id=\"1H0NXW\">At the heart of the Iran deal was a simple trade: Tehran would severely restrict its nuclear development in exchange for much-needed sanctions relief from the US and other signatories. But the US broke the pact and reimposed its sanctions after Trump withdrew from the deal three years ago, leading to a dramatic collapse of Iran’s economy made worse by the pandemic. </p>\n<p id=\"Dz87nm\">In response, Tehran violated <em>its</em> terms as a pressure tactic. Among the provocative moves, Iran began enriching uranium at levels beyond caps outlined in the accord.</p>\n<p id=\"9tAtpj\">That led to a standoff after Biden entered office. Even though the new administration signaled a desire to return to the deal, they said Iran would receive no sanctions relief until it came back into compliance with the agreement. Tehran, meanwhile, said the US had to lift the financial penalties first both as a sign of goodwill and out of fairness since Washington withdrew from the accord.</p>\n<p id=\"SbDfZZ\">Biden’s team made multiple efforts to break the deadlock. </p>\n<p id=\"M0MxSZ\">In February, for example, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2021/2/19/22291065/usa-iran-nuclear-deal-european-union-diplomacy\">Washington accepted an offer to hold informal talks with Tehran</a> brokered by the European Union. But <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2021/3/1/22307070/iran-nuclear-deal-rejection-wsj-usa-european-union\">Iran rejected the opportunity</a>, with one official saying the “time isn’t ripe for the proposed informal meeting.”</p>\n<p id=\"huL7rY\">And last month, according to <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2021/03/29/us-biden-iran-nuclear-deal-478354\">Politico</a>, the US proposed that Tehran stop enriching uranium and halt work on advanced centrifuges in exchange for partial sanctions relief. But once again, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/iran-nuclear-deal-participants-including-u-s-to-meet-in-vienna-next-week-11617361429?st=3tt7oxktuytfp7y&amp;reflink=article_copyURL_share\">Iran refused the offer</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"hN87ao\">All that bodes poorly for next week’s meeting, especially since the US and Iran won’t interact directly, a move Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif deemed “<a href=\"https://twitter.com/JZarif/status/1377950244508475392?s=20\">unnecessary</a>.” Price, the State spokesperson, told me “the US remains open” to such direct chats.</p>\n<p id=\"BNDAx8\">What seems more possible is Washington and Tehran could leave Austria with a better understanding of how both sides expect the Iran deal’s revival to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"ncVEru\">“At this point, it sounds that they are less interested in initial gestures than in defining what a comprehensive return to compliance would look like,” an unnamed US official told the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/iran-nuclear-deal-participants-including-u-s-to-meet-in-vienna-next-week-11617361429?st=3tt7oxktuytfp7y&amp;reflink=article_copyURL_share\">Wall Street Journal</a> on Friday. “We have no problem with that as it is consistent with our own initial view.”</p>\n<p id=\"hRKXex\">But even then complications abound, said Brewer, who worked on Iranian nuclear issues in the last administration’s White House.</p>\n<p id=\"jvRCAm\">“Think of it as two chunks of time. There’s the time it will take for the US and Iran to reach agreement on what constitutes compliance, the steps involved, and the sequence,” he told me. “And then once that is agreed, [there’s] the amount of time required to implement the plan.” Part of that implementation process involves verifying that Iran has in fact ended its nuclear advancements, and perhaps even a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/02/world/europe/us-iran-nuclear-deal.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage\">direct US-Iran meeting to finalize terms</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"ZDCAer\">Put together, there likely won’t be an all-encompassing pathway forward agreed to in Vienna next week. But the talks could signal the end of the standoff and a beginning of the road back to the nuclear pact.</p>\n\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 02 Apr 2021 15:00:00 +0000","feedId":99,"bgimg":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2knVHZGrxvTYUWqekXB_74G54B4=/430x0:5199x3577/1310x983/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69066528/1232057777.0.jpg","linkMd5":"75c2f01aa64a9c47b93a7dbc929d2639","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn20@2020_1/2021/04/03/04-50-08-334_19910d2477c345be.webp","destWidth":1310,"destHeight":983,"sourceBytes":103820,"destBytes":53882,"author":"Alex Ward","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2knVHZGrxvTYUWqekXB_74G54B4=/430x0:5199x3577/1310x983/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69066528/1232057777.0.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn20@2020_1/2021/04/03/04-50-08-334_19910d2477c345be.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617425407674},{"createdTime":"2021-04-03 12:50:07","updatedTime":"2021-04-03 12:50:07","title":"Your Slack DMs aren’t as private as you think  ","link":"https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/1/24/21079275/slack-private-messages-privacy-law-enforcement-lawsuit","description":"  \n\n    <figure>\n      <img alt=\"A computer screen with the Slack app showing 99 unread messages.\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1TyPS6XHfqGBO04DkFMM7hw4l6o=/240x0:1680x1080/1310x983/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66160948/Slack_Lede59.0.jpg\" />\n        <figcaption>Zac Freeland/Vox</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n  <p>How your employer (and others) can get your Slack messages.</p> <div class=\"c-float-left\">  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\"Open Sourced logo\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lcj6gww0ZKRDdVz0qOCNWvVxgYw=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19433750/open_sourced_story_logo.png\">\n  </figure>\n</div>\n<p id=\"wyLtnB\">Is Slack good for actually getting your work done? That’s <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/5/1/18511575/productivity-slack-google-microsoft-facebook\">debatable</a>. But the popular messaging platform — which boasted more than <a href=\"https://s23.q4cdn.com/371616720/files/doc_financials/2019/Q3/Earnings-Deck-3Q20-vF.pdf\">12 million daily active users</a> as of last year —  is definitely a promising medium for employers, regulatory agencies, the government, and even <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/18/20699237/slack-hack-2015-password-reset-keylogger-usernames-credentials\">hackers</a> seeking a trove of data about a company and its workers. Even your coworkers could find out more about you than you might expect. </p>\n<p id=\"xmGCC1\">The number of Slack messages your workplace might be able to access has actually grown as Slack has built out its workplace app. Last year, the company launched a new tool called <a href=\"https://slack.com/blog/transformation/slack-connect\">Slack Connect</a>, which allows different workplaces to share channels on the app. The company announced that the feature was expanded again last month, so anyone could <a href=\"https://slack.com/help/articles/1500001422062-Start-a-direct-message-with-someone-outside-your-company\">send invitations to direct message to other Slack users</a> — even if they work at <a href=\"https://www.protocol.com/slack-messaging-connect\">another workplace</a> (whether users can actually send and accept these invites depends on whether their workplace has put in restrictions). But just because you’re messaging someone at a different workplace doesn’t mean your boss couldn’t necessarily see the messages you send. </p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PAf1ozxgQPGdzQjFEOvGaoZvZDc=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22397806/PDE_Slack_Connect_DM.gif\">\n      <cite>Slack</cite>\n      <figcaption>Here’s what an initial version of Slack’s direct message function looks like.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<h3 id=\"OaHgYs\">Yes, your employer can get to your private messages. They’re not the only one. </h3>\n<p id=\"Y5RqB0\">First off, employers aren’t necessarily going through your messages to snoop on gossip.</p>\n<p id=\"drPBVa\">“The company may have a duty to preserve and produce that information if you’re part of a lawsuit,” explained Brad Harris, vice president of product at Hanzo, a company that provides a third-party, data-preservation app that works in conjunction with Slack, last year. “The company may also want to do internal investigations, and through their privacy policies and acceptable use policies, have the right to look at your information.” </p>\n<p id=\"0U78kl\">Harris added, “Companies have traditionally had that [right] with email.” Slack’s rolling out its direct message feature didn’t change much, though. “Clearly, the adage of ‘Don’t write anything in an email that you wouldn’t want to see on the front page of the Wall Street Journal’ applies to your use of Slack too,” Harris told Recode in March of this year.</p>\n<p id=\"gOSh6S\">Whether and how your boss can export your <a href=\"https://slack.com/help/articles/204897248-Guide-to-Slack-import-and-export-tools\">private messages and private channels</a> depends on a few factors. If your employer is using Slack’s free or standard plan <em>—</em> you can check this by going through the drop-down menu under your name on the app <em>—</em> they need Slack’s go-ahead, meaning the company will review your employer’s request and, if approved, allow the employer to conduct a one-time export. The messaging platform says it will provide that content if a company has gained employees’ consent, if the company is following a “valid legal process,” or if there’s a “right or requirement [to do so] under applicable laws.” </p>\n<p id=\"15YpeW\">For instance, employees in the European Union have the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/23/europe-gdpr-data-law-employer-employee\">right to certain data collected about them by their employers</a> under the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?ei=dSgqXqLoLMOc5gLImK2wBw&amp;q=GDPR+explained+Vox&amp;oq=GDPR+explained+Vox&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3..33i299l3.1765.1956..2080...0.3..0.91.237.3......0....1..gws-wiz.......0i71j33i160.9rznI_t4LQU&amp;ved=0ahUKEwji9vm-7JrnAhVDjlkKHUhMC3YQ4dUDCAs&amp;uact=5\">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</a> Companies using a Plus plan also need to apply for approval from Slack to export private communications, but the company can continue using the feature until they decide to turn it off. </p>\n<p id=\"u1LtKh\">Keep in mind that the data downloaded by an employer isn’t a mirror image of the actual Slack platform. Instead, workplace data is delivered in ZIP files, which contain a type of data-storing file called JSON. That means content comes up in long lines that resemble code, and includes message text, information about reactions, and even edit history (that’s right, your company could <a href=\"https://slack.com/help/articles/203950296-Privacy-FAQs\">retain</a> <a href=\"https://slack.com/help/articles/203457187-Customize-message-and-file-retention-policies\">your deleted </a>messages). You can see what that data actually looks like on Slack’s <a href=\"https://slack.com/help/articles/220556107\">website</a>, and if you want a quick profile of what data your company might be keeping, go to [yourorganization].slack.com/account/workspace-settings#retention.</p>\n<p id=\"9Qtl50\">This all applies to direct messages you might send to someone outside your workplace, too. </p>\n<p id=\"FtOpTi\">“Administrators can see that there is a relationship between their organization and another via the Connections view,” a Slack spokesperson told Recode. “The same controls an administrator has put in place for Slack Connect channels shared with external organizations applies to Slack Connect DMs.” </p>\n<p id=\"m2kqbN\">It’s also possible that your employer has invested in a higher-level plan, like Enterprise Grid. Those plans work with third-party apps like <a href=\"https://www.hanzo.co\">Hanzo</a> that allow employers to <a href=\"https://slack.com/apps/A3XLAEE05-hanzo\">store messages and other information</a>. Companies may need to consistently preserve electronic communications for review by regulatory agencies, such as the <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-44992.htm\">Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/guidance/reports/2019-report-exam-findings-and-observations/digital-communication\">Financial Industry Regulation Authority</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"6RChAI\">Still, Slack expects employers to follow employment agreements, corporate policies, and any relevant laws. “For employees, an employer’s rights to access your data are controlled by your employment agreement and by the laws that govern that — not by Slack,” said a Slack spokesperson in an email. “Employers ultimately own their company’s Slack data and are responsible for complying with the laws that govern how they access that data.”</p>\n<aside id=\"BBsaou\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Join the Open Sourced Reporting Network \",\"url\":\"https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/12/10/20970994/open-sourced-reporting-network\"}]}'></div></aside><p id=\"Jz9rVT\">It’s worth keeping in mind that there’s always the <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/2017/03/thinx-employee-accuses-miki-agrawal-of-sexual-harassment.html\">manual approach</a> to surveilling employees’ electronic communications: booting them from their computers while their Slack accounts are still logged in.

When Slack rolled out the DM feature allowing people to message others outside their organization feature in March, the tool was criticized because it could enable harassment, and the backlash forced Slack to make <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/24/22348422/slack-connect-direct-message-abuse-harassment\">some tweaks to the tool</a>. </p>\n<p id=\"615xx1\">Discussion of Slack data can come up in all sorts of complaints, as it did as part of <a href=\"https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ilnd.362523/gov.uscourts.ilnd.362523.1.0.pdf\">one</a> <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16352273673449182559&amp;q=Slack+chat&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2006&amp;as_ylo=2019\">class-action lawsuit</a> against the game developer <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/10/8/20904433/blizzard-hong-kong-hearthstone-blitzchung\">Activision Blizzard</a>. Discussion of Slack data also came up in a lawsuit against <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17650423129927336663&amp;q=Slack+microsoft+teams&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2006&amp;as_ylo=2019\">the California-based lighting fixture company Lamps Plus</a>. </p>\n<p id=\"os5MvT\">The government might also want Slack data as part of other legal processes. </p>\n<p id=\"wUYt6H\">In its most recent <a href=\"https://slack.com/trust/data-request/transparency-report\">transparency report</a> (which covers 2020), Slack says it received 38 requests from US government entities for both content and metadata, including through search warrants, subpoenas, and court orders. Only 10 of the requests for content data were fulfilled by Slack, but in 22 cases, the company provided government entities with other, non-content data, such as information about the date, time, and identities of senders and recipients of messages and files. Keep in mind, those numbers are pretty small; the company said in its last earnings report that it had more than <a href=\"https://investor.slackhq.com/news/news-details/2021/Slack-Announces-Strong-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2021-Results/default.aspx\">150,000 organizations</a> paying for its service, and customers can also use the platform for free. </p>\n<p id=\"ktETJ0\">Slack also says it will consider “national security requests,” though the company says it has yet to receive any. In 2019, Slack <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20201029175009/https://slack.com/intl/en-ca/trust/data-request/transparency-report\">granted one request </a>for non-content, user data stored in the US from an unnamed foreign government as part of following a mutual legal assistance treaty.</p>\n<p id=\"FYA3Vw\">Meanwhile, if you actually work for the government, it’s possible that your Slack communications <a href=\"https://handbook.18f.gov/slack/\">are records subject</a> to <a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/bulletins/2015/2015-02.html\">Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests</a>. FOIA is a law that allows nosey members of the public and journalists to request records about government activities, and the government must respond to those requests <a href=\"http://www.dmlp.org/legal-guide/time-periods-under-foia\">within 20 business days</a>. FOIA requesters appear to have successfully asked for <a href=\"https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/slack-management-72338/#file-807399\">other</a> Slack-related data, such as a list of team domains used by the government’s <a href=\"https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/list-of-all-gsa-slack-teams-23604/\">General Services Administration</a>. We couldn’t immediately find an example of when a US FOIA request has led to the release of Slack messages from within a government agency (though <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/3kkvnw/getting-nasa-to-comply-with-simple-foia-requests-is-a-nightmare\">some have tried</a>), if only because it’s unclear how many local, state, and federal government workers are using Slack.</p>\n<p id=\"UD32fN\">But a search of a federal contracts database reveals that <a href=\"https://www.usaspending.gov/#/award/CONT_AWD_19AQMM18C0146_1900_-NONE-_-NONE-\">the Department of State</a>, <a href=\"https://www.usaspending.gov/#/award/CONT_AWD_HQ003418P0182_9700_-NONE-_-NONE-\">the Department of Defense</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.usaspending.gov/#/award/CONT_AWD_HHSN271201700423P_7529_-NONE-_-NONE-\">Department of Health and Human Services</a>, and apparently the “Ebola team” at the <a href=\"https://www.usaspending.gov/#/award/CONT_AWD_AIDLABV1600038_7200_-NONE-_-NONE-\">US Agency for International Development</a> have all bought technology from the company; the platform has also <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/3kkvnw/getting-nasa-to-comply-with-simple-foia-requests-is-a-nightmare\">reportedly been used by NASA</a>. Slack is also being used by a unit of technologists — <a href=\"https://www.usaspending.gov/#/award/CONT_AWD_11316018P0001OMB_1100_-NONE-_-NONE-\">called the US Digital Service</a> — based in the president’s office. </p>\n<h3 id=\"rGFvpt\">Your coworkers can also get info on you, though it may not be that interesting</h3>\n<p id=\"HOCoM7\">Do you just have a regular employee Slack account? You can still get some (relatively benign) info on your coworkers via Slack. The first thing you should know is that you can still read all the messages and files that have been posted in public channels before you arrived (unless they’ve been deleted). Some companies might have content on their Slack systems set to auto-delete regularly, and those deletion periods can be <a href=\"https://slack.com/help/articles/203457187-Customize-message-and-file-retention-policies\">as short as one day</a>. </p>\n<p id=\"kXg5JK\">But there’s a bit you can do through Slack’s <a href=\"https://slackhq.com/up-and-to-the-right-brand-new-analytics\">Analytics tab</a> (go to [yourworkspace].slack.com/stats). There, you can see how the percentage of messages — and views — are distributed in direct messages, private channels, and public channels on any given day. In a large office, it’s not clear if this information would tell you much, but in a smaller company, these statistics might be a way for a boss to check whether there’s been a spike in people talking privately. Another interesting thing you can find out through Slack Analytics is which of your coworkers has sent the most messages of all time or in any given month, though it’s unclear how useful these stats are<strong>. </strong></p>\n<p id=\"PjHbcU\">It’s important to remember that even if your coworkers or even your boss might not have easy access to your private Slack messages, there’s still a lot they can learn about you based on your profile, like your time zone, your contact information, phone number, location, and social media (you might volunteer this information on the platform). You could also find their member ID number, which might not be too revealing, and files that they’ve sent by clicking through on their individual profile, which would potentially be more revealing. </p>\n<p id=\"eXXfXH\">Your employer and coworkers alike can also figure out whether you’re online, depending on your settings. That little green light? You can manually turn it off. If you don’t, Slack tells you if and when <a href=\"https://slack.com/help/articles/201864558-Set-your-Slack-status-and-availability\">you’ll appear as “active,”</a> depending on what device you’re on and how you’re using it. Whether you’re actually working hard is entirely up to you. Whether or not your company Slack offers any privacy is, maybe unfortunately, up to your employer.</p>\n<p id=\"ZxUUh7\"><strong>Update, Friday, April 2, 11 am ET:</strong> This piece was updated to include information about Slack’s newest feature and transparency report. </p>\n<hr class=\"p-entry-hr\" id=\"Kspa1l\">\n<div id=\"0f7cZE\"><iframe src=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfaGJVnifG8wyocJF_yhExE0lTt7C_ermilhoH0OpStlB2vUQ/viewform?embedded=true&amp;usp=embed_googleplus\" style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 3509px;\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div>\n<p id=\"vthJSb\"><a href=\"http://www.vox.com/open-sourced\"><em>Open Sourced</em></a><em> is made possible by Omidyar Network.

On Friday, when some, but not all,<strong> </strong>of those security procedures were still in place, a knife-wielding assailant allegedly<strong> </strong>rammed into Capitol police officers with his car. The incident reinvigorates questions about how to protect the Capitol, and whether some enhanced security measures should become permanent.</p>\n<p id=\"IsEkaS\">Officer William Evans was pronounced dead from his injuries, according to a <a href=\"https://www.uscp.gov/media-center/press-releases/loss-uscp-colleague-officer-william-f-evans\">statement from Capitol Police</a>. Evans was an 18-year veteran of the police force.</p>\n<p id=\"0fo2rX\">“It is with a very, very heavy heart that I announce one of our officers has succumbed to his injuries,” Capitol Police Chief Yogananda Pittman said Friday, adding that a second officer was injured. Pittman told reporters that after the unnamed man rammed two officers with his car and smashed the car into a security barrier, he exited the car brandishing a knife. The suspect has not yet been identified by police. </p>\n<p id=\"LdWllT\">“The suspect did start lunging toward US Capitol police officers, at which time US Capitol police officers fired upon the suspect,” Pittman said. “At this time, the suspect has been pronounced deceased.”</p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ym1knb3HG_8H0VJN6ZcjRwIU8Zw=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22416811/GettyImages_1232073348.jpg\">\n      <cite>Drew Angerer/Getty Images</cite>\n      <figcaption>Acting Capitol Police Chief Yogananda Pittman (right) speaks to reporters on April 2.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O7nJwd8gg7KapcIlLbF6wqv52pQ=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22416812/GettyImages_1310482858.jpg\">\n      <cite>Win McNamee/Getty Images</cite>\n      <figcaption>The Capitol was briefly locked down after a person reportedly rammed a vehicle into multiple Capitol Hill police officers.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"ZriBFp\">Though the Capitol was mostly empty with Congress on recess, Friday’s incident will inevitably prompt questions about whether the remaining enhanced security put in place after January 6 was enough. </p>\n<p id=\"l1fpm1\">In the immediate aftermath of the insurrection, new security measures were put in place:  </p>\n<ul>\n<li id=\"m5kWNh\">A <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/insurrection-at-the-capitol/2021/01/07/954469642/army-sec-says-a-temporary-fence-is-going-up-around-u-s-capitol\">7-foot-high barrier of “non-scalable” metal fencing</a> was put up around a four-mile perimeter surrounding the Capitol complex, blocking off a sprawling area around it and nearby buildings.</li>\n<li id=\"geg2jB\">Capitol Police officers and a belated deployment of<strong> </strong>around 25,000 National Guard members protected the building ahead of President Joe Biden’s inauguration day. Some National Guard members told <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/22229597/capitol-national-guard-security-inauguration-washington\">Vox</a> at the time that they were positioned around the four miles of black fence “just in case — and you know what I mean.”</li>\n<li id=\"dk0fXQ\">Lawmakers were required to<strong> </strong>walk through <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/22226869/congress-security-lauren-boebert-guns-storming-capitol-metal-detectors\">metal detectors</a> before stepping on their chamber’s floor. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s office authorized fines for members who sidestepped the detectors after a number of Republican lawmakers sidestepped them.</li>\n<li id=\"LOXixn\">In late January, Capitol Police planned to station members throughout airports and Union Station to monitor lawmakers and attempt to keep them safe while they were traveling.</li>\n</ul>\n<p id=\"sivbzS\">Some of those remain in place, but other measures have been modified. For instance:</p>\n<ul>\n<li id=\"Ydrcbm\">In March, law enforcement decided to <a href=\"https://www.nbc12.com/2021/03/24/fencing-us-capitol-outer-perimeter-taken-down/\">take down the outer perimeter of fencing around the Capitol complex</a>, though now there’s a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/capitol-fencing-removed/2021/03/15/fabfb34a-85a7-11eb-8a8b-5cf82c3dffe4_story.html\">smaller interior perimeter</a> immediately surrounding the Capitol building.</li>\n<li id=\"PNRybu\">The National Guard will also be deployed at the Capitol <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2021/03/09/975479113/pentagon-extends-national-guard-presence-at-the-capitol\">through mid-May at least</a>. Originally, they were slated to leave on March 12, but USCP requested that a reduced presence stay on for another 60 days. Roughly 2,300 National Guard members will remain stationed at the Capitol until May 23. <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/546213-watch-the-national-guard-and-law-enforcement-respond-to-todays\">Videos on Friday</a> showed members of the DC National Guard responding quickly to the incident and assisting Capitol Police in securing the perimeter. </li>\n</ul>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Pi-KwJlzpsV3pH5FEkHMQHaBre4=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22416836/GettyImages_1231521650.jpg\">\n      <cite>Kent Nishimura/Los Angeles Times via Getty Images</cite>\n      <figcaption>Members of the National Guard walk through a security fence surrounding the Capitol building on March 4.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"SzoHQk\">Rare incidents like this have happened before, and each was contained even while extreme security measures weren’t in place. In 2006, a suspect crashed a car into a barrier near the Supreme Court and got into the Capitol building before being detained.</p>\n<p id=\"LUQgRS\">But Friday’s incident showed that the Capitol complex, the lawmakers inside, and the officers guarding it all still face serious threats. Now, likely, comes a big debate about how closed off the seat of American democracy really needs to be.</p>\n<div class=\"c-float-right\"><div id=\"nTAzeZ\"><div data-anthem-component=\"aside:10296380\"></div></div></div>\n<h3 id=\"IjDI0i\">Enhanced security around the Capitol could become permanent</h3>\n<p id=\"izIl9X\">In early March, a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/capitol-riot-russel-honore/2021/03/08/bc5d2e56-8035-11eb-9ca6-54e187ee4939_story.html\">Capitol security review</a> found that the complex was extremely vulnerable, partly because the building’s police unit was “understaffed, insufficiently equipped, and inadequately trained.” The study, led by retired Army Lt. Gen. Russel Honoré, called for, among other things, the establishment of a “quick reaction force,” more Capitol Police officers, and better intelligence sharing. </p>\n<p id=\"mEWxyc\">Those suggestions <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2021/03/08/973991366/review-of-jan-6-riot-urges-more-police-mobile-fencing\">were at the time well received by lawmakers</a>, including some progressives who might be expected to question increased security funding. </p>\n<p id=\"3IW6Zm\">Honoré’s report also called for<strong> </strong>a retractable fence that was “easily erected and deconstructed.”</p>\n<p id=\"LH31yd\">Rep. Tim Ryan (D-OH), who is helping to lead Congress’s security response, told reporters on Friday a retractable fence and other measures will be considered. “We’ll be reviewing everything, at this point, including the fencing,” but he noted “it’s very, very early.”</p>\n<p id=\"pj7MLM\">“We can’t get too far ahead of ourselves without knowing that we have the ability to protect the Capitol, to harden the Capitol,” he continued.</p>\n<p id=\"HblcU6\">A Democratic lawmaker, who asked not to be identified, said that there were serious discussions underway about having a permanent fence around the Capitol, but that it would be of the retractable kind proposed in Honoré’s report. The member of Congress noted that the fencing would go up when there were intelligence reports of an imminent threat.</p>\n<p id=\"5OujFY\">But fencing may be where the majority of the debate about future security for the Capitol building lies. </p>\n<p id=\"sbZXZy\">In the weeks after the fencing went up, <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/03/09/republicans-democrats-agree-something-hating-capitol-fence/6923227002/\">Republican and Democratic lawmakers opposed</a> the fencing and the wide perimeter it established around the Capitol grounds, much of which is typically open for public visits. </p>\n<p id=\"KGLo9j\">Lawmakers felt so strongly on the issue that several sponsored legislation to bar any fencing from becoming permanent. In March, Sen. Roy Blunt (R-MO), Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), and Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-DC) introduced a measure to prevent federal funding from being used for a permanent barrier. </p>\n<p id=\"t12GIA\">“Permanent fencing would send an un-American message to the nation and the world, by transforming our democracy from one that is accessible and of the people to one that is exclusive and fearful of its own citizens,” Norton said at the time. </p>\n<p id=\"ofN7Yo\">Other members of Congress, meanwhile, are already upset the outer perimeter isn’t there anymore.</p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ssg5SjbpD5XYW3fBx8RoHi-RErU=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22416825/GettyImages_1231519230.jpg\">\n      <cite>Kent Nishimura/Los Angeles Times via Getty Images</cite>\n      <figcaption>Security fencing has walled off the Capitol building from the public since the January 6 attack.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"5UfoWI\">“I was not a fan of taking down the metal fencing as soon as we did,” Rep. Anthony Brown (D-MD) told Vox in an interview Friday. When asked why, he responded, “So cars can’t run over Capitol Police officers.”</p>\n<p id=\"S4ijCH\">Multiple congressional staffers Vox spoke to said they didn’t want to see an enhanced security presence around the Capitol well into the future — “God, I hope not,” exclaimed one aide. </p>\n<p id=\"6NGKsk\">“We all hated the fence, that hasn’t changed, but there was a true fear today,” added another staffer. “It strikes me as super unlikely it comes down this calendar year now.”</p>\n<p id=\"DT2RYN\">“I think the current security posture is plenty. The Capitol is not and should not be a fortress,” a third echoed, adding that the reforms they’d like implemented are better training and, potentially, more officers.</p>\n<p id=\"uqiQcL\">Another noted that there’s a long <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChadPergram/status/1378046824955662339\">history of assailants ramming their cars into Capitol barriers</a>. What this staffer would rather see is better protection for the Capitol Police, like ensuring they remain behind barriers until a vehicle stops completely. Still, the aide admitted, what to do next “is a tough question.”</p>\n<p id=\"PlTVgR\">After Friday, that’s a question that still needs an answer.
