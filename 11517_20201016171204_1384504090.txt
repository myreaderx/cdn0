This conference took place on the eve of the 12<sup>th</sup> annual CA-Day, organised by D-TRUST, in cooperation with TÜViT and ESMT. Both conferences were held in a hybrid format, with physical presence for the panellists at ESMT, in Berlin and virtual presence for the participants.</p> \n <p>In the past three years, the <a href=\"https://www.enisa.europa.eu/events/tsforum-caday-2020/\">Trust Services Forum</a> and CA-Day have taken place back-to-back to offer participants a two-day deep dive into the policy and technical aspects of the implementation of the eIDAS Regulation, which provides the regulatory framework in the European Union for electronic identification and Trust Services for cross-border electronic transactions. This year’s programme was held during the first review of the application of the <a href=\"http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32014R0910&amp;from=EN\" target=\"_blank\">eIDAS Regulation</a> (eIDAS).</p> \n <p class=\"callout\">The European Union Agency for Cybersecurity Executive Director <strong>Juhan Lepassaar</strong> said: <i>“<i>The EU Agency for Cybersecurity, ENISA, is moving fast to cover the ground of electronic identity and complement its ongoing support to the European Commission and the Member States in Trust Services. The work of ENISA on e-identity can complement the Commission’s efforts to increase EU citizens’ control over how their data is used, and contribute to a more cyber secure and trusted digital market across Europe</i>.”</i></p> \n <p>With eIDAS, the EU has laid the foundation and legal framework for citizens, businesses and public administrations to safely access services, and carry out transactions online and across borders. eIDAS solutions can create savings for companies and roll out the means for any cross-border activity that requires a secure and trusted environment.</p> \n <p>However, the COVID-19 pandemic across the EU has highlighted the security concerns of remote identification and authentication processes. Panellists elaborated on the upcoming revisions of the eIDAS that will aim to improve its effectiveness, extend its application to the private sector and promote trusted digital identities for all EU citizens</p> \n <p class=\"Default\"><b>Background</b></p> \n <p>The Trust Services Forum acts as a platform for participants to share their good practices on the implementation of trust services; review the standards, implementing acts and technical guidelines within the eIDAS; and discuss strategies to promote the adoption of qualified trust services. The EU Agency for Cybersecurity supports the Commission on the implementation of the eIDAS by providing security recommendations for the implementation of trust services, mapping technical and regulatory requirements, promoting the deployment of qualified trust services in Europe and raising awareness among users on securing their e-transactions. Under the EU Cybersecurity Act of 2019, the Agency gained an extended mandate to explore the area of electronic identification (eIDs) included in the regulation.</p> \n <p><b>About the Trust Services Forum</b></p> \n <p><a href=\"https://www.enisa.europa.eu/events/tsforum-caday-2020/\" target=\"_self\">Event webpage: Trust Services Forum - CA Day 2020</a></p> \n <p><a href=\"https://www.enisa.europa.eu/events/tsforum-caday-2020/tsf-cad-2020-agenda\">Trust Services Forum Agenda</a></p> \n <p><a href=\"https://www.enisa.europa.eu/events/tsforum-caday-2020/registration\">Trust Services Forum Registration</a></p> \n <p><b>About ENISA Publications</b></p> \n <p><a href=\"https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/annual-report-on-trust-services-security-incidents-in-2019\">2019 Annual Report on Trust Services Security Incidents</a></p> \n <p><a href=\"https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/incident-reporting\" target=\"_self\">ENISA Website: Incident Reporting Topic</a></p> \n <p><a href=\"https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/assessment-of-standards-related-to-eidas-i/\" target=\"_self\">ENISA Report: Overview of standards relate to eIDAS</a></p> \n <p><a href=\"https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/assessment-of-standards-related-to-eidas-ii/\" target=\"_self\">ENISA Report: Assessment of ETSI TS 119 403-3 related to eIDAS</a></p> \n <p><a href=\"https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/assessment-of-standards-related-to-eidas-i/\" target=\"_self\">ENISA Report: Overview of standards related to eIDAS</a></p> \n <p><a href=\"https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/eidas-compliant-eid-solutions\" target=\"_self\">ENISA Report: eIDAS compliant eID Solutions</a></p> \n <p class=\" \"><strong>Press Contact</strong></p> \n <p>For questions related to the press and interviews, please contact <a href=\"mailto:press@enisa.europa.eu\">press (at) enisa.europa.eu</a>.</p> \n <p>&nbsp;</p> \n <p>&nbsp;</p> \n <p class=\"discreet\">Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items &amp;
