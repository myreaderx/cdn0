Founded by ex-Tesla engineer Arch Rao, Span looks to address these questions, while asking, in a world of smart home devices, why the end-user access to grid energy has stayed stagnant for so long.</p>\n<p>Span is a young company – founded roughly this time three years ago. This time last year, it raised a $10.1 million Series A, and by the end of the year, was  rolling out its products to homes across the U.S.</p>\n<p>While not disclosing actual numbers, Rao tells me that Span, is “starting to capture a meaningful share of the storage market in the U.S. Especially in key markets like California.” Make of that what you will, but the company is particularly targeting solar users with a battery capture system.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>Announced today, Span’s second product is a smaller and more versatile unit, simply calling the Span Smart Panel. The system is also notably cheaper than its first-gen predecessor, knocking the $5,000 MSRP down to $3,500. Your results may vary on the price, as power companies will often bundle this technology with other offerings like solar panels.</p>\n<p>“This is part of the original vision that we thought about with Nest,” Nest co-founder and Span investor Matt Rogers said in an interview with TechCrunch. “There&#8217;s a lot you can do with your home. Nest and Google are heading in different directions. But the opportunity to understand the energy in your home and be the glue and the command center is still really real. Especially in this world where energy costs go up, and where solar and storage become pervasive. You can&#8217;t imagine a world in the future like that, that doesn&#8217;t have something like Span.”</p>\n<p>The system plays nicely with most home electrical panels and offers minute control for circuits, as well as support for Ethernet, Wi-Fi, cellular and Bluetooth connections. The company offers simple device control through a connected mobile app.</p>\n<p>“What we’ve done is fundamentally reinvent the home electrical panel,” Rao tells TechCrunch. “We are not tied to a single use case. We are the backbone of everything in your home. Some homes have thermostats, some don’t. Some homes have solar, some don’t. But practically every home has an electrical panel that is still using technology that is 100 years old.”</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"qYUGgkdXVe\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/12/ex-tesla-product-exec-raises-10-million-for-his-mission-to-upgrade-the-lowly-fuse-box/\">Ex-Tesla product exec raises $10 million for his mission to upgrade the lowly fuse box</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Ex-Tesla product exec raises $10 million for his mission to upgrade the lowly fuse box&#8221;

In fact, Pipe claims that its ability to achieve a $2 billion valuation in just under a year since its public launch in June of last year makes it the fastest fintech to reach this valuation in history. While I can’t substantiate that claim, I can say that its growth has indeed been swift and impressive.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hurst, Josh Mangel and Zain Allarakhia founded Pipe in September 2019 </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">with the mission of giving SaaS companies a way to get their revenue upfront, by pairing them with investors on a marketplace that pays a discounted rate for the annual value of those contracts. (Pipe describes its buy-side participants as “a vetted group of financial institutions and banks.”)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The goal of the platform is to offer companies with recurring revenue streams access to capital so they don’t dilute their ownership by accepting external capital or get forced to take out loans.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More than 4,000 companies have signed up on the Pipe trading platform since its public launch in June 2020, with just over 1,000 of those signing up since its March raise, according to Hurst. Tradable annual</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">recurring revenue (ARR) on the Pipe platform is in excess of $1 billion and trending toward $2 billion,</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">with tens of millions of dollars currently being traded </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">every month</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. When I last talked to the company in March, it had reported tens of millions of dollars traded in all of the first quarter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Growth has been insane,” Hurst told TechCrunch. “This speaks to why we managed to raise at such a high valuation and attract so much investor interest.”</span></p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2154315\" style=\"width: 1450px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2154315\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2154315 size-full\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PipePressKit_Trade.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1440\" height=\"900\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PipePressKit_Trade.jpg 1440w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PipePressKit_Trade.jpg?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PipePressKit_Trade.jpg?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PipePressKit_Trade.jpg?resize=768,480 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PipePressKit_Trade.jpg?resize=680,425 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PipePressKit_Trade.jpg?resize=50,31 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1440px) 100vw, 1440px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2154315\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Pipe</p></div></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over time, Pipe’s platform has evolved to offer non-dilutive capital to non-SaaS companies as well.

A cloud storage service, <a href=\"https://protonmail.com/blog/proton-drive-early-access/\">Proton Drive</a>, is also slated for public release later this year.</p>\n<p>For all these products it claims take the same &#8216;zero access&#8217; hands off approach to user data. Albeit, it&#8217;s a bit of an apples and oranges comparison to compare e2e encrypted email with an encrypted VPN service &#8212; since the issue with VPN services is that they can see activity (i.e. where the encrypted or otherwise packets are going) and that metadata can sum to a log of your Internet activity (even with e2e encryption of the packets themselves).</p>\n<p>Proton claims it doesn’t track or record its VPN users’ web browsing. And given its wider privacy-dependent reputation that&#8217;s at least a more credible claim vs the average VPN service. Nonetheless, you do still have to trust Proton not to do that (or be forced to do that by, for e.g., law enforcement). It&#8217;s not the same technical &#8216;zero access&#8217; guarantee as it can offer for its e2e encrypted email.</p>\n<p>Proton does also offer a free VPN &#8212; which, as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/01/wtf-is-a-vpn/\">we&#8217;ve said before</a>, can be a red flag for data logging risk &#8212; but the company specifies that users of the paid version subsidize free users. So, again, the <em>claim</em> is zero logging but you still need to make a judgement call on whether to trust that.</p>\n<h2>From Snowden to 50M+</h2>\n<p>Over ProtonMail&#8217;s seven year run privacy has certainly gained cache as a brand promise &#8212; which is why you can now see data-mining giants like Facebook making ludicrous claims about &#8216;pivoting&#8217; their people-profiling surveillance empires to &#8216;privacy&#8217;. So, as ever, PR that&#8217;s larded with claims of &#8216;respect for privacy&#8217; demands very close scrutiny.</p>\n<p>And while it&#8217;s clearly absurd for an adtech giant like Facebook to try to cloak the fact that its business model relies on stripping away people&#8217;s privacy with claims to the contrary, in Proton&#8217;s case the privacy claim is very strong indeed &#8212; since the company was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2014/06/23/protonmail-is-a-swiss-secure-mail-provider-that-wont-give-you-up-to-the-nsa/\">founded with the goal of being &#8220;immune to large scale spying&#8221;</a>. Spying such as that carried out by the NSA.</p>\n<p>ProtonMail&#8217;s founding idea was to build a system &#8220;that does not require trusting us&#8221;.</p>\n<p>While usage of e2e encryption has grown enormously since 2013 &#8212; when disclosures by NSA whistleblower, Edward Snowden, revealed the extent of data gathering by government mass surveillance programs, which were shown (il)liberally tapping into Internet cables and mainstream digital services to grab people’s data without their knowledge or consent &#8212; growth that&#8217;s certainly been helped by consumer friendly services like ProtonMail making robust encryption far more accessible &#8212; there are worrying moves by lawmakers in a number of jurisdictions that clash with the core idea and threaten access to e2e encryption.</p>\n<p>In the wake of the Snowden disclosures, &#8216;Five Eyes&#8217; countries steadily <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/25/australia-wants-five-eyes-to-squeeze-tech-firms-on-encryption/\">amped up international political pressure on e2e encryption</a>. Australia, for example, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/05/australia-rushes-its-dangerous-anti-encryption-bill-into-parliament/\">passed an anti-encryption law in 2018</a> &#8212; which grants police powers to issue &#8216;technical notices&#8217; to force companies operating on its soil to help the government hack, implant malware, undermine encryption or insert backdoors at the behest of the government.</p>\n<p>While, in 2016, the UK <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/29/yes-the-uk-now-has-a-law-to-log-web-users-browsing-behavior-hack-devices-and-limit-encryption/\">reaffirmed its surveillance regime</a> &#8212; passing a law that gives the government powers to compel companies to remove or not implement e2e encryption. Under the Investigatory Powers Act, a statutory instrument called a <a href=\"https://beta.techcrunch.com/2017/05/05/uk-surveillance-law-still-fuzzy-on-decryption-rules-for-comms-providers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Technical Capability Notice</a> (TCN) can be served on comms services providers to compel decrypted access. (And as the <a href=\"https://www.openrightsgroup.org/blog/endgame-for-end-to-end-encryption/\">ORG</a> noted in April, there&#8217;s no way to track usage as the law gags providers from reporting anything at all about a TCN application, including that it even exists.)</p>\n<p>More recently, UK ministers have kept up public pressure on e2e encryption &#8212; <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56795852\">framing it as an existential threat to child protection</a>. Simultaneously they are legislating &#8212; via an <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/uk-publishes-draft-online-safety-bill/\">Online Safety Bill, out in draft earlier this month</a> &#8212; to put a legally binding obligation on service providers to &#8216;prevent bad things from happening on the Internet&#8217; (as the <a href=\"https://www.openrightsgroup.org/blog/online-harms-encryption-under-attack/\">ORG</a> neatly sums it up). And while still at the draft stage, private messaging services are in scope of that bill &#8212; putting the law on a potential collision course with messaging services that use e2e encryption.</p>\n<p>The U.S., meanwhile, has <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/16/senate-fisa-section-702-cloture-vote-wyden-paul/\">declined to reform warrantless surveillance</a>.</p>\n<p>And if you think the EU is a safe space for e2e encryption, there are reasons to be concerned in continental Europe too.</p>\n<p>EU lawmakers have recently made a push for what they describe as &#8220;<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/on-encryption-and-counter-terrorism-eu-lawmakers-say-theyll-work-for-lawful-data-access/\">lawful access</a>&#8221; to encrypted data — without specifying exactly how that might be achieved, i.e. without breaking and/or backdooring e2e encryption and therefore undoing the digital security they also say is vital.</p>\n<p>In a further worrying development, EU lawmakers have proposed automated scanning of encrypted communications services — aka a provision called ‘chatcontrol’ that’s ostensibly targeted at prosecuting those who share child exploitation content — which raises further questions over how such laws might intersect with &#8216;zero access&#8217; services like ProtonMail.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://european-pirateparty.eu/the-end-of-the-privacy-of-digital-correspondence/\">European Pirate Party</a> has been sounding the alarm &#8212; and dubs the &#8216;chatcontrol&#8217; <a href=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/docs_autres_institutions/commission_europeenne/com/2020/0568/COM_COM(2020)0568_EN.pdf\">proposal</a> &#8220;the end of the privacy of digital correspondence&#8221; &#8212; <a href=\"https://www.patrick-breyer.de/en/posts/message-screening/\">warning</a> that &#8220;securely encrypted communication is at risk&#8221;.</p>\n<p>A plenary vote on the proposal is expected in the coming months &#8212; so where exactly the EU lands on that remains to be seen.</p>\n<p>ProtonMail, meanwhile, is based in Switzerland which is not a member of the EU and has one of the stronger reputations for privacy laws globally. However the country also backed beefed-up surveillance powers<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/26/swiss-public-back-law-expanding-surveillance-powers/\"> in 2016</a> &#8212; extending the digital snooping capabilities of its own intelligence agencies.</p>\n<p>It does also adopt some EU regulations &#8212; so, again, it&#8217;s not clear whether or not any pan-EU automated scanning of message content could end up being applied to services based in the country.</p>\n<p>The threats to e2e encryption are certainly growing, even as usage of such properly private services keeps scaling.</p>\n<p>Asked whether it has concerns, ProtonMail pointed out that the EU&#8217;s current temporary chatcontrol proposal is voluntary &#8212; meaning it would be up to the company in question to decide its own policy. Although it accepts there is &#8220;some support&#8221; in the Commission for the chatcontrol proposals to be made mandatory.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It’s not clear at this time whether these proposals could impact Proton specifically [i.e. if they were to become mandatory],&#8221; the spokesman also told us. &#8220;The extent to which a Swiss company like Proton might be impacted by such efforts would have to be assessed based on the specific legal proposal. To our knowledge, none has been made for now.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;We completely agree that steps have to be taken to combat the spread of illegal explicit material. However, our concern is that the forced scanning of communications would be an ineffective approach and would instead have the unintended effect of undermining many of the basic freedoms that the EU was established to protect,&#8221; he added. &#8220;Any form of automated content scanning is incompatible with end-to-end encryption and by definition undermines the right to privacy.&#8221;</p>\n<p>So while Proton is rightly celebrating that a steady commitment to zero access infrastructure over the past seven years has helped its business grow to 50M+ users, there are reasons for all privacy-minded folk to be watchful of what the next years of political developments might mean for the privacy and security of all our data.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"M6mvIagazU\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/protonmail-threema-tresorit-and-tutanota-warn-eu-lawmakers-against-anti-encryption-push/\">ProtonMail, Threema, Tresorit and Tutanota warn EU lawmakers over &#8216;anti-encryption&#8217;

Though Otter.ai is already integrated with Zoom, the assistant is designed to make using transcription something you don&#8217;t have to constantly remember to enable at the meeting&#8217;s start or stop at the end, while also serving as a place where participants can collaborate by asking questions, sharing photos and more, as the meeting is underway.</p>\n<p>The feature also works around the earlier limitation with Zoom, where only the meeting host could use the Otter.ai integration directly.</p>\n<p>The idea to automate meeting transcription makes sense for the remote work environment <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/boosted-by-the-pandemic-meeting-transcription-service-otter-ai-raises-50m/\">created by the pandemic</a>, where people have been splitting their time between work, parenting, homeschooling and other duties. This can often lead to meetings where users are pulled away and miss things that had been said. That&#8217;s one area where Otter.ai can help. But it can also help with issues like overlapping meetings, or larger meetings were only a few topics are directly relevant to your work &#8212; but where you&#8217;d like to be able to review the rest of the meeting discussion later, instead of in real-time.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>To use the new Otter Assistant, users first synchronize their Google Calendar or Microsoft Calendar with Otter&#8217;s service. The assistant will then automatically join all Zoom meetings going forward, where it appears as an additional meeting participant, for transparency&#8217;s sake.</p>\n<p>The assistant also posts a link to the transcription in the Zoom chat for everyone to access. In other words, this is not a feature to use to skip meetings without your boss knowing &#8212; it&#8217;s designed for those times when everyone has already agreed the meeting will be transcribed.</p>\n<p>As the meeting continues, attendees can use Otter&#8217;s live transcript to highlight key parts, add photos, and make notes. They can also ask questions via the commenting feature, as opposed to speaking up &#8212; which may be helpful if you&#8217;re in a noisy place at the time of the meeting.</p>\n<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/jzbRLczOk1w?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>\n<p>Once the assistant is enabled, you don&#8217;t have to remember to turn on Otter.ai for each meeting, and you can even use your headphones to listen to the meeting in progress. The Otter Assistant will still be able to record both sides of the conversation.</p>\n<p>However, you are able to turn Otter Assistant off on a per-meeting basis via the &#8220;My Agenda&#8221; section on the Otter website, which will include new toggles next to each meeting you have scheduled.</p>\n<p>When meetings wrap, you can also have Otter.ai configured to automatically share the meeting notes with all the attendees.</p>\n<p>The Otter Assistant is available to Otter.ai Business users, which are <a href=\"https://otter.ai/pricing\">upgraded plans </a>that start at $20 per month, and include features like two-factor authentication, SOC2 compliance, advanced search, export, custom vocabulary, shared speaker identification, centralized data and billing, and more.</p>\n<p>To date, Otter.ai says it has transcribed over 150 million meetings, up from 100 million <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/a-i-powered-transcription-service-otter-ai-can-now-record-from-google-meet/\">in the beginning of 2021</a> .

And because a birthday sounds like a good opportunity to share some metrics, the <a href=\"https://www.efounders.com/companies\">portfolio companies</a> have reached a valuation of $2 billion together —&#160;only 18 months after <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/08/startup-studio-efounders-has-a-portfolio-valuation-of-1-billion/\">reaching</a> $1 billion.</p>\n<p>eFounders says it is focused on building the future of work. In practical terms, it means the company is building B2B SaaS startups with a focus on productivity and workflows. For instance, <a href=\"https://frontapp.com\">Front</a>, <a href=\"https://aircall.io\">Aircall</a> and <a href=\"https://www.spendesk.com\">Spendesk</a> all started with eFounders.</p>\n<p>There have been a few exits, such as TextMaster, Mention, Mailjet, Hivy and Briq. Those exits are included in the total valuation of eFounders companies —&#160; exit values are freezed as of date of exit. But Front, Aircall and Spendesk could represent even more massive successes down the road.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>“When we started in 2011, there was an existing model that was Rocket Internet. We liked the entrepreneurship spirit but we didn’t like the philosophy,” co-founder and CEO Thibaud Elzière told me.</p>\n<p>Instead of copying Rocket Internet altogether, they altered the business model quite drastically on three different aspects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>They try to come up with original startup ideas, not copycats;</li>\n<li>They want to work with entrepreneurs, not consultants-turned-entrepreneurs;</li>\n<li>Their portfolio companies should be able to operate on their own after 12 to 18 months.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When eFounders come up with a new project, they act as a sort of third co-founder. The startup studio tries to find a CEO and a CTO. In exchange for a third of equity, the eFounders core team helps take the project off the ground. When the startup raises a seed round, eFounders moves on from day-to-day activities and focuses on new projects.</p>\n<p>And it’s been working well. With 30 portfolio companies, there are now 1,500 people working for an eFounders-backed company. Combined, they generate $131 million in annual recurring revenue.</p>\n<p>As for the next 10 years, Elzière doesn’t think eFounders can simply increase the cadence and launch more and more projects. “It’s a model that isn’t scalable — it’s hand crafted,” he said.</p>\n<p>There are two ways to expand. First, eFounders is going to focus on more verticals. That’s why the startup studio partnered with Camille Tyan so that he would be in charge of fintech projects. You can imagine another studio for blockchain startups, another one for AI startups, etc.</p>\n<p>“We want to remain focused on software with a B2B angle — not enterprise but long-tail B2B. We don’t pretend to be a general-purpose studio, but we can acquire specific skills and knowledge on specific topics,” Elzière said.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"p3aXp6TYCI\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/saas-startup-studio-efounders-launches-a-fintech-startup-studio/\">SaaS startup studio eFounders launches a fintech startup studio</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;SaaS startup studio eFounders launches a fintech startup studio&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/saas-startup-studio-efounders-launches-a-fintech-startup-studio/embed/#?secret=p3aXp6TYCI\" data-secret=\"p3aXp6TYCI\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>If there are some liquidity events with some of the most successful eFounders companies, the startup studio is also going to use part of its cash to invest in other companies. This eFounders fund would focus on seed investments in SaaS companies with a hands-on approach.</p>\n<p>But having more money isn’t necessarily a bad thing as SaaS products today don’t look like SaaS products from ten years ago.</p>\n<p>“Creating a SaaS company today is a lot more complicated and more expensive,” Elzière said. “People who use Notion tell you that Notion is slow because it takes more than 100 milliseconds to load a page. People expect the same thing in consumer apps and in SaaS when it comes to performance, design and experience.”</p>\n<p>“Companies raise more and more money because there’s a lot of money available, but also because it takes more and more time and skills in order to build a product,” he added.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=P25kWUA9srs:1ERjwD6ozJw:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=P25kWUA9srs:1ERjwD6ozJw:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=P25kWUA9srs:1ERjwD6ozJw:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=P25kWUA9srs:1ERjwD6ozJw:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=P25kWUA9srs:1ERjwD6ozJw:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=P25kWUA9srs:1ERjwD6ozJw:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=P25kWUA9srs:1ERjwD6ozJw:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=P25kWUA9srs:1ERjwD6ozJw:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/P25kWUA9srs\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 19 May 2021 12:04:58 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"047df2b5e3bdc3b88c034fcf24e7f006","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn7@2020_3/2021/05/19/14-56-01-155_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Romain Dillet","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn7@2020_3/2021/05/19/14-56-01-155_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn35@2020_2/2021/05/19/14-56-03-137_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn99@2020_2/2021/05/19/14-56-02-555_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=P25kWUA9srs:1ERjwD6ozJw:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn67@2020_5/2021/05/19/14-56-14-668_a94c01814e30ecee.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=P25kWUA9srs:1ERjwD6ozJw:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn34@2020_1/2021/05/19/14-56-02-579_3690d20bd876a5d1.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn51@2020_1/2021/05/19/14-56-03-246_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/P25kWUA9srs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn79@2020_1/2021/05/19/14-56-03-370_8d7498c0d656f2f7.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1621436161032},{"createdTime":"2021-05-19 22:56:01","updatedTime":"2021-05-19 22:56:01","title":"Forecast nabs $19M for its AI-based approach to project management and resource planning","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2154549","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Project management has long been a people-led aspect of the workplace, but that has slowly been changing. Trends in automation, big data, and AI have not only ushered in a new wave of project management applications, but they have led to a stronger culture of people willing to use them. Today, one of the startups building a platform for the next generation of project management is announcing some funding &#8212; a sign of the traction it&#8217;s getting in the market.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.forecast.app/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Forecast</a>, a platform and startup of the same name that uses AI to help with project management and resource planning &#8212; put simply, it uses artificial intelligence to both &#8220;read&#8221; and integrate data from different enterprise applications in order to build a bigger picture of the project and potential outcomes &#8212; has raised $19 million to continue building out its business.</p>\n<p>The company plans to use some of the funding to expand to the U.S., and some to continue building out its platform and business, headquartered in London with a development office also in Copenhagen.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>This funding, a Series A, comes less than a year after the startup&#8217;s commercial launch, and it was led by Balderton Capital, with previous investors Crane Ventures Partners, SEED Capital and Heartcore also participating.</p>\n<p>Forecast closed a seed round in <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/01/forecast/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">November 2019</a> and then launched just as the pandemic was kicking off. It was a time when some projects were indeed put on ice, but others that went ahead did so with more caution on all sorts of fronts &#8212; financial, organizational, and technical. It turned out to be a &#8220;right place, right time&#8221; moment for Forecast, a tool that plays directly into providing a technical platform to manage all of that in a better way, and it tripled revenues during the year. Its customers include the likes of the NHS, the Red Cross, Etain and more. It says over 150,000 projects have been created and run through its platform to date.</p>\n<p>Project management &#8212; the process of planning what you need to do, assigning resources to the task and tracking how well all of that actually goes to plan &#8212; has long been stuck between a rock and a hard place in the world of work.</p>\n<p>It can be essential to getting things done, especially when there are multiple departments or stakeholders involved; yet it&#8217;s forever an inexact science that often does not reflect all the complexities of an actual project, and therefore may not be as useful as it could or should be.</p>\n<p>This was a predicament that founder and CEO Dennis Kayser knew all too well, having been an engineer and technical lead on a number of big projects himself. His pedigree is an interesting one: one of his early jobs was as a developer at Varien, where he built the first version of Magento. (The company was <a href=\"https://inchoo.net/magento/varien-is-now-magento-inc/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">eventually rebranded as Magento</a> and then <a href=\"https://www.ebayinc.com/stories/news/ebay-inc-completes-acquisition-magento/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">acquired by eBay</a>, then <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20151102006822/en/eBay-Completes-Sale-eBay-Enterprise\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">spun out</a>, then <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/21/adobe-to-acquire-magento-for-1-6-b/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">acquired again, this time by Adobe</a> for nearly $1.7 billion, and now a huge player in the world of e-commerce tools.) He also spent years as a consultant at IBM, where among other things he helped build and formulate the first versions of ikea.com.</p>\n<p>In those and other projects, he saw the pitfalls of project management <em>not</em> done right &#8212; not just in terms of having the right people on a project at the right time, but the resource planning needed, better calculations of financial outcomes in the event of a decision going one way or the other, and so on.</p>\n<p>(He didn&#8217;t say this outright, but I&#8217;m sure one of the points of contention was the fact that the first ikea.com site didn&#8217;t actually have any e-commerce in it, just a virtual window display of sorts. That would have been because Ikea wanted to keep people shopping in its stores, away from the efficiency of just buying the one thing you actually need and not the 10 you do not. Yes, there are plenty of ways now of recirculating people to buy more when you select one item for a shopping cart &#8212; something the likes of Amazon has totally mastered &#8212; but this was years ago when there was still even more opportunities for innovation than there are now. All of this is to say that you might very reasonably argue that had there been better project managing and resource planning tools to give forecasts of potential outcomes of one or another route taken, people advocating for a different approach could have made their case better. And maybe Ikea would have jumped on board with digital commerce far sooner than it did.)</p>\n<p>&#8220;Typically you get a lot of spreadsheets, people scattered across different tools that include accounting, CRM, Gitlab and more,&#8221; Kayser said.</p>\n<p>That became the impetus for trying to build something that can take all of that into account and make a project management tool that &#8212; rather than just being a way of accounting to a higher-up, or reflecting only what someone can be bothered to update in the system &#8212; something that can help a team.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Connecting everything into our engine, we leverage data to understand what they are working on and what is the right thing to be working on, what the finances are looking like,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;So if you work in product, you can plan out who is where, and what resourcing you need, what kind of people and skills you require.&#8221; This is a more dynamic progression of some of the other newer tools that are being used for project management today, targeting, in his words, &#8220;people who graduate from Monday and Asana who need something ore robust, either because they have too many people working on a project or because its too complicated, there is just too much stuff to handle.&#8221;</p>\n<p>More legacy tools he said that are used include Oracle &#8220;to some degree&#8221; and Mavenlink, which he describes as possibly Forecast&#8217;s closest competitor, &#8220;but its platform is aging.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Currently the Forecast platform has <a href=\"https://www.forecast.app/integrations\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">some 26 integrations</a> of popular tools used for projects to produce its insights and intelligence, including Salesforce, Gitlab, Google Calendar, and, as it happens, Asana. But given how fragmented the market is, and the signals one might gain from any number of other resources and apps, I suspect that this list will grow as and when its customers need more supported, or Forecast works out what can be gleaned from different places to paint an even more accurate picture.</p>\n<p>The result may not ever replace an actual human project manager, but certainly starts to then look like a &#8220;digital twin&#8221; (a phrase I have been hearing more and more these days) that will definitely help that person, and the rest of the team, work in a smarter way.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We are really excited to be an early investor in Forecast,&#8221; said James Wise,  a partner at Balderton Capital, in a statement. “We share their belief that the next generation of SaaS products will be more than just collaboration tools, but use machine learning to actively solve problems for their users. The feedback we got from Forecast&#8217;s customers was quite incredible, both in their praise for the platform and in how much of a difference it had already made to their operations. We look forward to supporting the company to scale this impact going forward.”</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=APFWRZ9MfDc:54slq-Uk_50:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=APFWRZ9MfDc:54slq-Uk_50:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=APFWRZ9MfDc:54slq-Uk_50:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=APFWRZ9MfDc:54slq-Uk_50:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=APFWRZ9MfDc:54slq-Uk_50:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=APFWRZ9MfDc:54slq-Uk_50:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=APFWRZ9MfDc:54slq-Uk_50:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=APFWRZ9MfDc:54slq-Uk_50:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/APFWRZ9MfDc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 19 May 2021 08:22:35 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"959cb4b0224b72038e4d06b98209a30f","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn7@2020_3/2021/05/19/14-56-01-155_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Ingrid Lunden","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn7@2020_3/2021/05/19/14-56-01-155_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn35@2020_2/2021/05/19/14-56-03-137_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn99@2020_2/2021/05/19/14-56-02-555_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=APFWRZ9MfDc:54slq-Uk_50:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn14@2020_6/2021/05/19/14-56-02-589_71923291b7e67c4d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=APFWRZ9MfDc:54slq-Uk_50:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn67@2020_1/2021/05/19/14-56-32-694_6cd0a3bbf01cc0a9.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn51@2020_1/2021/05/19/14-56-03-246_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/APFWRZ9MfDc":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn16@2020_6/2021/05/19/14-56-03-102_f734755c1985d92f.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1621436161033},{"createdTime":"2021-05-19 22:56:01","updatedTime":"2021-05-19 22:56:01","title":"Formlabs raises $150M","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2154646","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">A massive raise for the 3D printing industry this morning, as Massachusetts-based Formlabs has announced a $150 million Series E.

That might not always result in amazing copy, but on the plus side you can always click the button again and give it another try,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Frantz says that with so much competition in the space, he and his co-founder felt they could build a market much faster as part of a larger and broader marketing platform solution like Unbounce.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I love Tamara&#8217;s vision for the future of Unbounce. I think she has a very ambitious vision. She sold me on that very early on in the process. At the same time, there was a lot of competition in the space, and to have a key differentiator with a company like Unbounce, which has a decade of marketing experience and a lot of trust within this community, I think it&#8217;s a very powerful wedge that we can use to further grow our audience,&#8221; Frantz said.</p>\n<p>The tool lets you write a range of copy from landing pages to Google ad copy. The company launched in alpha last October and already had 30,000 customers, which Grominsky says Unbounce hopes to convert into customers. The good news for those customers is that the company plans to leave Snazzy as a stand-alone product, while incorporating the tech into the platform in ways that make sense in the coming year.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"LkG8WqIE2P\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/17/unbounce-funding/\">Unbounce raises $38.4M to build better landing pages with automation</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Unbounce raises $38.4M to build better landing pages with automation&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/17/unbounce-funding/embed/#?secret=LkG8WqIE2P\" data-secret=\"LkG8WqIE2P\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=--6IbSB54HQ:bsMraqFoY50:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=--6IbSB54HQ:bsMraqFoY50:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=--6IbSB54HQ:bsMraqFoY50:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=--6IbSB54HQ:bsMraqFoY50:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=--6IbSB54HQ:bsMraqFoY50:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=--6IbSB54HQ:bsMraqFoY50:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=--6IbSB54HQ:bsMraqFoY50:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=--6IbSB54HQ:bsMraqFoY50:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/--6IbSB54HQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 19 May 2021 13:00:36 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"30e2684d9359adf887822d4e9c9d7448","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn7@2020_3/2021/05/19/14-56-01-155_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Ron Miller","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn7@2020_3/2021/05/19/14-56-01-155_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn35@2020_2/2021/05/19/14-56-03-137_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn99@2020_2/2021/05/19/14-56-02-555_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=--6IbSB54HQ:bsMraqFoY50:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn19@2020_6/2021/05/19/14-56-02-751_e5a52f7dce803f06.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=--6IbSB54HQ:bsMraqFoY50:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn95@2020_2/2021/05/19/14-56-02-584_67510aefc572edaf.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn51@2020_1/2021/05/19/14-56-03-246_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/--6IbSB54HQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn87@2020_2/2021/05/19/14-56-02-648_6b38a577361fb687.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1621436161032},{"createdTime":"2021-05-19 22:56:01","updatedTime":"2021-05-19 22:56:01","title":"Review: Apple’s 2021 iPad Pro is great, again, but…","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2154655","description":"<p class=\"p1\">If you’ve lived in a few places in your life then you probably have experienced the feeling of moving into a nice new apartment or house — a blank canvas of rooms and spaces filled with possibility. Most times, unless you’ve got that money money, you then fill it up with all of your same, old dinged up furniture.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I have had this experience a bunch over the years. When I moved out of my parent’s house, every single piece of furniture I had was thrifted, rescued or gifted. A mash-mash of centuries and styles that was well lived in the day I got it. Even as I got married and even moved much of that same furniture came with.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Eventually, much of it began to feel too out of place and we passed it on and carefully bought or made things that we felt represented our home and resonated with us. But there is still that odd piece, like that dinged up dutch modern coffee table, that we look at and remember the sticky cocktail clutter of karaoke nights in our 20’s and the —still sticky — kid’s snacks of our 30’s.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p class=\"p1\">That’s where iPad is now.

That’s what consumers are getting in the mail when they order one now. But, Apple’s Worldwide Developer’s Conference is coming in <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/apples-wwdc-stays-online-only-kicking-off-june-7/\">just a couple of weeks</a> and I hope to basically review this iPad Pro all over again in a new light.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_1087.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-2154677\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_1087.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_1087.jpg 4032w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_1087.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_1087.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_1087.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_1087.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_1087.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_1087.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_1087.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Ironically, one of the biggest hardware upgrades for this model is going to elicit a relatively muted response in me here. The M1 chip is <i>absolutely </i>blistering. It delivers the same performance as the M1 MacBook Pro did in benchmark tests, making Apple’s lineup more a matter of form factor and use case than raw power. But last year’s model frankly still feels just as fast in almost all of the applications that I tested and certainly in all of my daily workflows. <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Yes, it’s super powerful and you’re getting the absolute latest in silicon, but upgraders won’t see any immediate difference. In some ways this is by design. In my <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/25/interview-apple-executives-on-the-2021-ipad-pro-stunting-with-the-m1-and-creating-headroom/\">interview last month with Apple’s John Ternus and Greg Joswiak</a> about the iPad Pro they noted that the new unified processor strategy and the aggressively good display are about creating overhead that they hope developers will take advantage of.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_1089.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-2154675\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_1089.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_1089.jpg 4032w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_1089.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_1089.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_1089.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_1089.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_1089.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_1089.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_1089.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The new iPad Pro cameras are pretty fantastic, both front and back are now <i>very</i> usable and the new front camera especially benefits from an increase in resolution and new wide-angle optics. This wide angle makes video calling a bit more relaxed and doable on iPad Pro.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">That is coupled with Center Stage, Apple’s new ML-driven feature that automatically crops and centers your head and shoulders, following you around with a smooth and forgiving pan and zoom as you lean, stand and even move about a room within the view of the camera. The feature works by using machine learning frameworks to detect a person’s silhouette within the frame and then applies “camera moves” to that view as you shift in the frame. Unlike some other auto-zooming features, Center Stage feels like there is a virtual camera operator there helping you to frame yourself properly. It’s really clever and very nicely done — and it’s one of the biggest upgrades to iPad Pro usability this time around.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/centerstage.gif\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-2154683\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/centerstage.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"775\" /></a></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">And yes, if you’re wondering, this does a <i>lot</i> to mitigate the camera placement issues on iPad Pro. The camera remains in the ‘top center’ of a vertically oriented iPad Pro, which means that it is on the ‘middle left’ of a horizontally oriented keyboard-bound setup. This has led to an awkwardness in iPad video calling. Center Stage doesn’t completely delete these issues, hand placement is still a problem at times, but it goes a long way to making it more usable. The new APIs will make this feature available to all video calling apps by the way, and there are also some slight improvements in multi-tasking which let you use multi-pane setups without blanking out your video call in the process of a Zoom.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I tested the external Thunderbolt connection with Apple’s Pro Display XDR and it works fine. The displays are very close in capability so, aside from the scaling, this arrangement could prove to be very useful for pros working in a pipeline with XDR displays for color correction purposes. The software limitation of the iPad Pro only supporting mirror mode is still in effect, alas, which makes the usability of this feature a bit suspect in most situations.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Speaking of the screen, the mini-LED driven Liquid Retina XDR display is probably the best display that’s ever shipped on a mobile computer. It’s just fantastic. The daily driving brightness is good, with an average of 600 nit max, but full screen HDR content like videos or photos allow the display to boom up to 1,000 nits average with a peak of 1,600 nits. This thing is b r i g h t. Daylight viewing of HDR content is massively improved. And this comes with inclusion of all of the standard stuff like the 120hz ProMotion features.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The 10,000 mini-LEDs in the display allow for much more precise localization of blacks (because they can turn off completely) and less bloom (though extreme tests still show it). They also provide a noticeably better edge-to-edge uniformity in brightness and improved off-axis viewing of content on the screen. It’s just better in every way. Absolute gold standard display here.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_1088.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-2154676\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_1088.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_1088.jpg 4032w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_1088.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_1088.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_1088.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_1088.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_1088.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_1088.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_1088.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Apple’s new Magic Keyboard works essentially exactly the same as the previous version, but it now comes in white. I’m also happy to report that if you have an existing one it works <i>completely fine</i> on the new iPad Pro models. There was some minor uproar because Apple noted that the dimensions of the two devices were not the same so the old keyboard may not fit perfectly. Rest assured that it’s essentially the same exact fit and the functionality is identical. The only time any of it is evident is if you close it and peer very, very carefully at the open end you’ll notice that there is about 1mm less clearance between the rim of the case and the edge of the iPad Pro. Apple probably felt that it was better to over-disclose than anything here but really, it’s not an issue.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The white color is fantastic looking, especially with the silver model of iPad Pro and its white antenna window accents. It’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3949GAIokg\">very 2001</a> (even though Kubrik’s iPads were black). I would fully, 100% expect this thing to get marred and dingy though. There’s a warning on the box that ‘color may transfer’ and I would believe it. My demo unit has not sustained any noticeable markings yet but I would guess that it’s just a matter of time.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The overall feel of the keyboard is still great, a really nice typing experience and great little piece of kit that should be factored into the price of purchase of any iPad Pro because it’s just essential.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The other side of this coin that isn’t so shiny is the iPad’s aging software. It’s just as good as it was when I wrote my <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/24/review-100000-miles-and-one-week-with-an-ipad-pro/\">review of the iPad Pro in 2020</a> — at which point my conclusions were ‘you can adapt to it but it could be better’. That was a year ago. As someone who has used it as my only portable machine for the last two and a half years I can tell you that this is a very long time to wait for a big leap forward in capability.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I have a very simple ask for the iPad’s software. I want to feel the same energy vivacity and pure performance for the sake of peak performance that the hardware side exhibits.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Apple’s iPad Pro hardware is performing like an athlete in peak physical condition that is out three lengths ahead. The M1 chip and mini-LED display are really untouchable &#8211; it is exhilarating to see this much excellence packed into one device.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Unfortunately the software can not cash those checks, leaving this iPad Pro to feel like a perfect house with the same old furniture.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_1092.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-2154672\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_1092.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_1092.jpg 4032w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_1092.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_1092.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_1092.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_1092.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_1092.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_1092.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_1092.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Apple has done an incontestably incredible job with the 2021 iPad Pro’s hardware, but it needs to level the software up. As a ‘power’ user that lives on iPad Pro much of the year, I have grown used to my kludges and tic-affordances. But there needs to be some big time commitment to the iPad paradigm here. The pane-style interface currently has so many things to recommend it as a brutally fast, fluid way to work, but there is no follow through. There is no willingness to say ‘this is a new way of working and you will learn it.’<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Too much of the iPad Pro’s current software leans into ‘affordance valley’. A place where users are still treated as if they aren’t capable of learning a touch-first way of working. Instead, these affordances actually do the opposite and stand in the way of progress.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This reminds me of the ‘reduce animations’ affordance circa the iOS 7 era. When Apple reinvented iOS it went way overboard in animations in order to make it super clear to the user what was happening when they were tapping around the new pane-based interface. Nothing was ‘slower’ hardware wise but the animated affordances they put in were tuned too far up and made it <i>feel</i> slower. Turning those animations off made the interface feel snappier and more useful almost instantly.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Apple eventually got those animations under control by conceding that maybe people were indeed ready to be more advanced touch users.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This is where the iPad Pro is currently and it’s the disparity that irks the most. This is one of the best computing hardware devices ever made, and you know it’s capable of so much more than it is currently being let do. Apple has always had an editorial point of view when it comes to software and I can appreciate that. But currently, it feels like that stance is far too conservative when it comes to iPad Pro.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">That’s why I’m waiting for WWDC with bated breath. With this much high-level execution on the hardware side, you have to imagine that the time is ripe for Apple to really take the next leap forward with iPad software. When that happens and we get a solid view of Apple’s vision for the next wave of iPad work, I’ll come back to the table with another look.</p>\n<p><a

id=\"speakable-summary\">The real estate sales market has been in an <a

rel=\"noopener\">upswing</a> this year, and today a startup that&#8217;s addressing one of homeowners&#8217; biggest needs &#8212; repair and maintenance services, and specifically the stress of sorting these out when things break down &#8212; is announcing some funding on the heels of strong growth.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.hellosuper.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Super</a> &#8212; which has built a business providing repair and maintenance for electrical and mechanical systems, appliances, and plumbing by way of a monthly subscription &#8212; has closed a growth round of $50 million.</p>\n<p>The startup plans to use the funding to expand into new markets, to hire more people, and to continue adding more maintenance/repair services and partnerships into its wider home-warranty-by-subscription proposition.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>CEO Jorey Ramer, who co-founded the company with Ryan Donnelly (VP of engineering), also said that another part of the investment will be used to enhance the AI tech that underpins Super&#8217;s service and <a href=\"https://www.hellosuper.com/pricing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">pricing plans</a>. More on that below.</p>\n<p>The San Francisco-based company is currently active in some of the fastest-growing housing markets in the U.S.,  Austin, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Phoenix, San Antonio, and Washington, D.C. (ironically not in SF itself), and it has grown revenue 7x since April 2019, when it previously raised money, a<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/17/super-raises-20m-to-fix-the-home-services-and-repairs-market-with-its-subscription-service/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> $20 million Series B</a>. It&#8217;s not disclosing actual revenue numbers, nor user numbers.</p>\n<p>This is latest Series C has a number of strategic backers that speaks to the bigger ecosystem of financial and insurance services that interlink with each other, and which are used by the average person in the course of home ownership. (Indeed, Super these days seems to refer to itself as an &#8220;insuretech&#8221;.)</p>\n<p>Led by Wells Fargo Strategic Capital, the venture arm of the banking giant, others in the round included home construction giant Asahi Kasei, AAA &#8211; Auto Club Group (which also sells insurance), Gaingels, and REACH. The last of these is a scale-up service from Second Century Ventures, which is the investment fund of the National Association of Realtors. Aquiline Technology Growth, Liberty Mutual Strategic Ventures, Moderne Ventures and the HSB Fund of Munich Re Ventures &#8212; which all invested in <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/17/super-raises-20m-to-fix-the-home-services-and-repairs-market-with-its-subscription-service/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Super&#8217;s previous $20 million round</a> back in April 2019 &#8212; also participated.</p>\n<p>The company has now raised $80 million in total, and it&#8217;s not disclosing its valuation.</p>\n<p>As we have noted before, Ramer came up with the idea for Super when he himself moved to San Francisco after he sold his previous startup, Jumptap — an advertising network <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2013/08/13/millennial-acquires-jumptap/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">acquired by Millennial Media</a> (which is now part of Verizon by way of its acquisition of AOL, just like TechCrunch). He&#8217;d been an apartment renter for all of his adult life, but when he moved to the Bay Area, he found himself buying property, and it came with more than a little reluctance because of the headache of taking care of his new home.</p>\n<p>“I liked being a renter,” he said in an interview. “You pay a fee, and you know what to expect.” (“Super” is a reference to the superintendents that handle maintenance and repair in an apartment building, and to what Super hopes customers will think about its service.)</p>\n<p>The route that Ramer decided to take for how to approach filling that gap, interestingly, is not unlike the challenges that Jumptap faced in the world of ad tech: instead of trying to build a services business from the ground up, he opted to build an integrated network that tapped into a number of small services enterprises already working in the business of maintaining homes. (The correlation here is that, rather than building a first-party behemoth, the approach is to knit together a number of online properties so that people looking to advertise can do so across a wide range of places in a network).</p>\n<p>Super has created a kind of marketplace: the services businesses and individuals that Super engages with to carry out maintenance and repairs are all licensed and use its platform for free, essentially, and Super handles remuneration based on call-outs. For users, the call-outs come as <a href=\"https://www.hellosuper.com/pricing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">part of their monthly plans</a>, and they include different options based on which level of service they pay for.</p>\n<p>The funding it&#8217;s announcing today will be used in part to enhance how those monthly plans work.</p>\n<p>Not only are there algorithms that Super has built to determine how to price its services based on location, size of home and other factors; but there are features in the app that subscribers can use to interact with Super to report issues, call out maintenance people, and provide more detail about problems to improve faster, and in some cases, automated adjudication on issues.</p>\n<p>Better tech for more responsive home services has been an interesting area of the market, but one that&#8217;s largely been ignored up to now, but as they have matured, AR and other computer vision breakthroughs have definitely helped to advance that game. (And a number of others are also tapping into that, including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/hover-secures-60m-for-a-3d-imaging-platform-used-to-assess-and-fix-properties/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hover</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/nana-nabs-6m-for-an-online-academy-and-marketplace-dedicated-to-appliance-repair/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nana</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/jobber-raises-60m-as-its-platform-for-home-service-professionals-hits-100k-users/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Jobber</a> and more.)</p>\n<p>The way that the service has been built to scale &#8212; working with contractors means adding in more kinds of coverage is easier than building from the ground up &#8212; also means that Super over time may well add more services into the mix.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The things we would do are things your super would do,&#8221; Ramer said. &#8220;So that might include fixing plumbing, but might also potentially include cleaning carpets, which you could think of as maintenance. Painting is another interesting area. It seems like it might be a cosmetic thing, but if you do not paint, you risk dry rot. It&#8217;s also preventative care. So if we, say, cover 100% maintenance you could imagine that included, too.&#8221;</p>\n<p>One area where it&#8217;s unlikely to move is general contract work, say rebuilding a bathroom or kitchen, or adding in a new room in your loft: the focus it seems will remain on the essentials of keeping your home working.</p>\n<p>But aside of expanding the services directly on its own platform, there are also potentially opportunities for how Super might work with partners. AAA for example has a notable business not just in roadside assistance but also insurance coverage. Ramer describes Super as &#8220;roadside assistance for your home,&#8221; and he points out that it&#8217;s a natural partnership to sell those alongside each other.</p>\n<p>Similarly, Wells Fargo, as a mortgage lender, is a natural complement, providing a route to its customers to help maintain the properties that they&#8217;re in the process of paying off to the bank. This in turn also becomes a kind of insurance policy to the bank itself, as it keeps the homes it is financing in better shape.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">“Wells Fargo embraces innovation, and we’re excited to support a tech-forward platform like Super which brings further advancement to the home services market,” said Matthew Raubacher, managing director for WFSC’s Principal Technology Investments Group, in a statement. “The challenges of ongoing repairs and maintenance resonates with every homeowner, and Super provides an experience that is convenient for the customer, while boosting job visibility for local contractors and businesses. We look forward to seeing them continue to widen their geographic footprint and expand their product offering.”</span></p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=vXnlIdbf_7E:Q9wjbYWH6vA:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=vXnlIdbf_7E:Q9wjbYWH6vA:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=vXnlIdbf_7E:Q9wjbYWH6vA:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=vXnlIdbf_7E:Q9wjbYWH6vA:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=vXnlIdbf_7E:Q9wjbYWH6vA:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=vXnlIdbf_7E:Q9wjbYWH6vA:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=vXnlIdbf_7E:Q9wjbYWH6vA:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=vXnlIdbf_7E:Q9wjbYWH6vA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/vXnlIdbf_7E\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 19 May 2021 13:21:04 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"ceb517d492b144c1bc27ebf3e01a3de3","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn7@2020_3/2021/05/19/14-56-01-155_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Ingrid Lunden","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn7@2020_3/2021/05/19/14-56-01-155_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn35@2020_2/2021/05/19/14-56-03-137_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn99@2020_2/2021/05/19/14-56-02-555_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=vXnlIdbf_7E:Q9wjbYWH6vA:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn84@2020_4/2021/05/19/14-56-02-753_083c9169fce84276.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=vXnlIdbf_7E:Q9wjbYWH6vA:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn40@2020_4/2021/05/19/14-56-32-663_98748b41cd8e6349.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn51@2020_1/2021/05/19/14-56-03-246_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/vXnlIdbf_7E":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn31@2020_6/2021/05/19/14-56-02-701_95bb11119607eb18.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1621436161033},{"createdTime":"2021-05-19 22:56:01","updatedTime":"2021-05-19 22:56:01","title":"API security startup 42Crunch raises $17M Series A led by Energy Impact Partners","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2153972","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">With security top of mind in many companies these days, especially given how many staff work at home, there is one area that remains chronically ignored: that of the world of APIs which power all of the platforms we all use every day.</p>\n<p>Now, a significant player in the cybersecurity of APIs is super-charging its offering.  42Crunch, an API security startup, has raised $17 million in a Series A round led by Energy Impact Partners.

They all came about due to API vulnerabilities. 83% of internet traffic now comes from APIs but traditional firewall approaches are not adapted to cope with the specific threats that APIs create.”</p>\n<p>The three French co-founders came up with the idea after being the number of APIs used by customers proliferate.</p>\n<p>The normal approach to firewalls &#8211; relying on patterns and signatures to detect potential incursions &#8211; does not work when it comes to API traffic. 42Crunch claims its platform can individually protect each API, and prevent common cyber-attacks such as injections but also API-specific attacks.</p>\n<p>Isabelle Mauny, Co-founder and CTO of 42Crunch, said: “Protecting APIs from threats at runtime is only part of the story. APIs will only be truly secured when security becomes part of the developer’s flow, rather than an afterthought.”</p>\n<p>Nazo Moosa, Co-Managing Partner, Energy Impact Partners added: “42Crunch’s ‘shift-left approach’ to the creation of secure-by-design APIs fits strongly with EIP’s vision of protecting global critical infrastructure.

But how many of those people do you actually know well, and, more importantly, do you ever connect with them and meet others from their networks?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You don’t go to LinkedIn to meet people. You don’t hang out and spend meaningful time there,” said Alex Taub, co-founder and CEO of <a href=\"https://upstreamapp.com/\">Upstream</a>, a new professional networking platform that just closed a $2.75 million seed round, bringing their total raised to $3.25 million. The round was led by Ibex Investors and managing partner Nicole Priel (who joins the board) and includes participation by 8-Bit Capital, Human Ventures, NYVP, Converge Venture Partners and a number of angel investors.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Your LinkedIn network is not a good representation of who you actually know and how well you know them.

The week before, the guest speaker was U.S. Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey.</span></p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"OyjW6G2tVS\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/6-miami-based-investors-share-their-views-on-the-regions-startup-scene/\">8 Miami-based investors share their views on the region&#8217;s startup scene</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;8 Miami-based investors share their views on the region&#8217;s startup scene&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/6-miami-based-investors-share-their-views-on-the-regions-startup-scene/embed/#?secret=OyjW6G2tVS\" data-secret=\"OyjW6G2tVS\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To me, the experience felt like LinkedIn meets Clubhouse meets Hoppin.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Upstream, which is pre-revenue and is Miami-based, is a company whose founder was attracted to the Sunshine State from NYC during the pandemic. Taub and his family signed a two-year lease here and plan to reevaluate their residence in the summer of 2022; they are one of the movers who are cautiously optimistic about the tech industry’s recent explosion in the Magic City.</span></p>\n<h2>The origin story</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Taub and his co-founder, Michael Schonfeld, are both serial entrepreneurs, having built and sold Social Rank for an undisclosed amount before launching Upstream in October 2020. The impetus for the company came as a solution to a struggle Taub faced in his daily life.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Throughout my life, regardless of the job I’ve been in, I spend my time making introductions, connecting people and helping friends hire rock-star talent. Like many people, I get energy from helping others,” Taub said. “When COVID-19 hit and the job market took a dive last March, the number of requests for help I received increased 100X. I noticed quickly that my speed of responding to emails and brain capacity to connect the dots became the limiting factor in getting people help,” he added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So it’s no surprise that Upstream started as a product where people could ask for help, and others from the community pitched in. The company now has more than 200 communities (similar to LinkedIn groups), and about 75% of the people who attend an initial Upstream event return for a second one.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I joke that we are building a product that people need because I need it. We feel that we are the right team to solve this problem because we so desperately want it ourselves,” Taub said.</span></p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"e9Vk7LtFdn\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/11/accessing-social-groups-through-referrals/\">Accessing social groups through referrals</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Accessing social groups through referrals&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/11/accessing-social-groups-through-referrals/embed/#?secret=e9Vk7LtFdn\" data-secret=\"e9Vk7LtFdn\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=yoHhGeVOd7c:_c34h9ctldo:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=yoHhGeVOd7c:_c34h9ctldo:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=yoHhGeVOd7c:_c34h9ctldo:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=yoHhGeVOd7c:_c34h9ctldo:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=yoHhGeVOd7c:_c34h9ctldo:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=yoHhGeVOd7c:_c34h9ctldo:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=yoHhGeVOd7c:_c34h9ctldo:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=yoHhGeVOd7c:_c34h9ctldo:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/yoHhGeVOd7c\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 19 May 2021 11:00:04 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"73936cf24922d186d6c745ab654b77c3","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn7@2020_3/2021/05/19/14-56-01-155_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Marcella McCarthy","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn7@2020_3/2021/05/19/14-56-01-155_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn35@2020_2/2021/05/19/14-56-03-137_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn99@2020_2/2021/05/19/14-56-02-555_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=yoHhGeVOd7c:_c34h9ctldo:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn96@2020_5/2021/05/19/14-56-03-207_57088d13b6e0a6c9.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=yoHhGeVOd7c:_c34h9ctldo:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn71@2020_4/2021/05/19/14-56-03-357_3810d9dbf6199426.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn51@2020_1/2021/05/19/14-56-03-246_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/yoHhGeVOd7c":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn3@2020_1/2021/05/19/14-56-02-957_f75d9c0064c2911e.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1621436161033},{"createdTime":"2021-05-19 22:56:01","updatedTime":"2021-05-19 22:56:01","title":"PhonePe in talks to acquire Indian app store Indus OS","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2154554","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Walmart-backed Indian payments services firm PhonePe is in advanced stages of talks to acquire <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/10/samsung-venture-india-indusos/\">Samsung-backed Indus OS</a>, a startup that operates an eponymous third-party Android app store, a source familiar with the matter told TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>The deal values Noida-headquartered Indus OS at $60 million, the source said, requesting anonymity as the matter is private.

The Bangalore-based startup has long offered its own mini app store on its app. A handful of firms &#8212; including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/04/google-policy-cut-india-paytm-mini-app-store/\">PhonePe rival Paytm</a> &#8212; have either launched or explored launching their own mini app stores in recent months.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=5lupCsDtQVE:mzrrANihyp4:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=5lupCsDtQVE:mzrrANihyp4:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=5lupCsDtQVE:mzrrANihyp4:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=5lupCsDtQVE:mzrrANihyp4:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=5lupCsDtQVE:mzrrANihyp4:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=5lupCsDtQVE:mzrrANihyp4:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=5lupCsDtQVE:mzrrANihyp4:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=5lupCsDtQVE:mzrrANihyp4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/5lupCsDtQVE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 19 May 2021 08:36:23 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"06953c9727c5b12bb1898b5bc9957ca9","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn7@2020_3/2021/05/19/14-56-01-155_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Manish Singh","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn7@2020_3/2021/05/19/14-56-01-155_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn35@2020_2/2021/05/19/14-56-03-137_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn99@2020_2/2021/05/19/14-56-02-555_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=5lupCsDtQVE:mzrrANihyp4:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn83@2020_3/2021/05/19/14-56-02-950_5484bb1c1f75c3b2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=5lupCsDtQVE:mzrrANihyp4:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn87@2020_1/2021/05/19/14-56-03-367_67c01f62a9567d07.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn51@2020_1/2021/05/19/14-56-03-246_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/5lupCsDtQVE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn79@2020_6/2021/05/19/14-56-02-547_ba4520440c729323.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1621436161033},{"createdTime":"2021-05-19 22:56:01","updatedTime":"2021-05-19 22:56:01","title":"Blue Origin reveals highest bid for a seat on its first human spaceflight, currently at $2M","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2154662","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Blue Origin is taking a novel approach to selling the first available private spaceflight seat on its New Shepard rocket, with an auction that will award the spot to the highest bidder.

The larger startup in the space is Payfit which has raised upwards of $208.4M to do something that lots of companies find quite painful. But Payfit does a lot of other things as well, potentially leaving it exposed. Now a startup aims to come along and hone in on the thorny issue of payroll automation, alone.</p>\n<p>Founded by Jonas Bøgh Larsen and Emil Hagbarth Rasmussen, Danish firm <a href=\"https://www.pento.io/\">Pento</a> has raised $15.6 million in a Series A funding led by General Catalyst. Also participating was Avid Ventures and the UK’s LocalGlobe. Existing investors Point Nine Capital, Moonfire Ventures, Hustle Fund, and Seedcamp also took part, alongside angels (see below). This latest funding takes the total raised by Pento to $18.4 million.</p>\n<p>The startup claims 700 companies are using it including tech firms Pleo and Cuvva; large hospitality brands (Honest Burgers); and retail and e-commerce brands (Lacoste, Beauty Pie). Pento replaces spreadsheets etc and gives them cloud-based tools, real-time calculations, transparency, and online and telephone support.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>Pento co-founder and CEO, Jonas Bøgh Larsen told me: “The biggest process we&#8217;re replacing is payroll outsourcing where companies are outsourcing payroll to an accountant, which the vast majority of companies do in Europe. We automate the entire process from reporting to tax calculations to payments. So, what most other platforms or payable products do is basically just helping you calculate the right taxes and National Insurance, and so on. We also take care of the reporting. We also do payments, and we integrate the product to other HR products.”</p>\n<p>Adam Valkin, Managing Director at General Catalyst said: &#8220;Despite being so business-critical, payroll is one of the least digitally advanced services across the globe. It’s also one that has garnered a reputation for being too complex, too convoluted and too out of reach for those who aren’t payroll specialists, leading many to consider expensive outsourcing as the only route to go. Pento dispels this myth because it’s built purely with HR and finance teams in mind, by business leaders who truly understand the frustrations involved. It’s easy-to-use, transparent, flexible, secure and affordable. It’s what payroll should be in a modern company and it represents the future of employee compensation.”</p>\n<p>Pento’s angel are from Stripe (Thairu and Diede van Lamoen), Monzo (Tom Blomfield), GoCardless (Matt Robinson), Zoom (Eric Yuan), Cuvva (Freddy Macnamara), Intercom (Des Traynor) and others.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a
