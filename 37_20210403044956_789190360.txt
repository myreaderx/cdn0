I love that they exist. I love that we have computers that are not only fast enough to translate and emulate instructions in real time for <em>totally different computers that may not even exist any more </em>but also for computers that are shipping today!</p> <p>I love these C# based emulators:</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://www.hanselman.com/blog/coreboy-is-a-cross-platform-gameboy-emulator-written-in-c-that-even-does-ascii\">CoreBoy is a cross platform GameBoy Emulator written in C# that even does ASCII</a>  <li><a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://www.hanselman.com/blog/emulating-a-playstation-1-psx-entirely-with-c-and-net\">Emulating a PlayStation 1 (PSX) entirely with C# and .NET</a></li></ul> <p>Today I learned about <a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://github.com/Ryujinx/Ryujinx\">Ryujinx, an experimental Nintendo Switch Emulator written in C# on .NET Core</a>. The homepage is at <a title=\"https://ryujinx.org/\" href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://ryujinx.org/\">https://ryujinx.org/</a>. Emulators are great for learning about how to write and factor great code. Some are certainly \"big ball of mud\" architecture, but RyuJinx is VERY nice.</p><figure><a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://ryujinx.org/\"><img title=\"Ryujinx\" style=\"display: inline\" alt=\"Ryujinx\" src=\"https://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/d0ef5f5b6de1_146B7/shell_fullsize_38e5d0f6-bfaa-4124-acfe-b7c2ac5278e4.png\" width=\"999\" height=\"682\"></a>  <p>Ryujix is particularly cleanly factored with individual projects and modules that really follow the single responsibility principal.</p><p> It's written in <a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~http:/www.dot.net\">.NET 5</a> and you can just git clone it, and go into the Ryujinx folder and \"dotnet run,\" or build from Visual Studio. There are also daily builds on their site.  <p>Some of the impressive features - and again, this is written in C# on cross-platform open source .NET 5:</p> <ul> <li>The CPU emulator, ARMeilleure, emulates an ARMv8 CPU and currently has support for most 64-bit ARMv8 and some of the ARMv7 (and older) instructions, including partial 32-bit support. It translates the ARM code to a custom IR, performs a few optimizations, and turns that into x86 code.  <li>The GPU emulator emulates the Switch's Maxwell GPU using the OpenGL API (version 4.4 minimum) through a custom build of OpenTK.  <li>Xinput-compatible controllers are supported natively; other controllers can be supported with the help of Xinput wrappers such as x360ce.</li></ul> <p>Most emulators are created for educational and experimental purposes, so don't look to be using this for nefarious purposes. This is a fantastic codebase to explore and experiment with. </p> <p>Using a computer is like riding in a Lyft. Writing an Emulator is like disassembling an internal combustion engine and putting it back together differently and it still works. It won't make you a better person but it will make you appreciate your Lyft.</p> <hr>  <p><strong>Sponsor:</strong> Simplify code, reduce costs, and build faster without compromising the transactionality, scale and flexibility you need. <strong>Fauna </strong>- a global serverless database for all your applications. <a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~hnsl.mn/3lf5zdk\">Learn more!</a></p>\n<br/><hr/>Â© 2021 Scott Hanselman.

Up that to about $26 a month and you've got 3.5 gigs of RAM and 2 Cores AND 10 gigs of storage. Use ALL that RAM. Max out that storage - use the resources you have paid for. If you hit up against a limit you can always add more and scale up. Run those boxes hot, you paid for them!</p> <p>While my blog and podcast and main site run on Azure Premium SKUs (and are fast and it's worth it) I have a dozen little one pagers, brochureware sites, and toys like <a title=\"https://www.keysleft.com/\" href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://www.keysleft.com/\">https://www.keysleft.com/</a> and I've managed them all in an App Service as well. But they are static sites. They are nothing sites...so why do I need an App Service? It's overkill.</p> <p>Turns out <a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/app-service/static/\">Azure Static Web Apps</a> are a lovely thing and they are FREE while in Preview. It's great for static sites, sites made with static site generators, or <a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://jamstack.org/\">Jamstack</a> sites with <a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/apis\">serverless functions behind them</a>.</p> <p>So I converted a bunch of my little sites to Azure Static Web Apps. Took maybe 90 minutes to do 8 of them as seen below.</p><figure><img title=\"Azure Static Web Apps\" style=\"display: inline\" alt=\"Azure Static Web Apps\" src=\"https://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/5cf3f2bb9280_F3BA/image_bd8fbb89-b878-4927-afae-2aa73a6841df.png\" width=\"999\" height=\"729\"></figure>  <p>Since the code for these sites was already in GitHub, it was very easy to move them. </p> <p>For example, the code for the KeysLeft site is at <a title=\"https://github.com/shanselman/keysleft\" href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://github.com/shanselman/keysleft\">https://github.com/shanselman/keysleft</a> and <a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://github.com/shanselman/keysleft/actions\">Azure Static Web Apps has a GitHub Action</a> that easily deploys it on every commit. It's butter. It's created for you but <a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://github.com/shanselman/keysleft/blob/master/.github/workflows/azure-static-web-apps-purple-glacier-0590b801e.yml\">you can see the generated GitHub Action as it lives alongside your code</a>.</p> <figure><img title=\"Azure Static Web App Static Site\" style=\"display: inline\" alt=\"Azure Static Web App Static Site\" src=\"https://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/5cf3f2bb9280_F3BA/image_57a6505d-934e-48df-afbd-b29213367a27.png\" width=\"999\" height=\"736\"></figure> <p>The docs are clear and it works nicely with Vue, React, Angular, or just regular HTML like my <a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://www.myhamsterblog.com/\">son's Hamster Blog</a>. <a title=\"https://www.myhamsterblog.com/\" href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://www.myhamsterblog.com/\">https://www.myhamsterblog.com/</a></p> <p>As it's in Preview now it's free, and I'm sure it'll be super cheap when it goes live. I have no idea how much it will cost but I'll worry about that later. For now it's allowed me to turn off an entire Azure App Service and replace it with Azure Static Web Apps.</p> <p>They also support <a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/custom-domain\">custom domains</a> and they automatically make and assign you an SSL cert. My only complaint is that there's no easy support (today) for apex domains (so all mine have www. as CNAMES) but you <a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://burkeholland.github.io/posts/static-app-root-domain/\">could proxy it through a free Cloud Flare account if you really want</a>.</p> <p>Check it out, I suspect you have a site right now that's either generated or just static and this could save you some money.</p> <hr>  <p><strong>Sponsor:</strong> Protect your apps from reverse engineering and tampering with PreEmptive, the makers of Dotfuscator.

Be here. What is your body telling you. Freak out fully but put a time limit on it.\" </p> <p>This idea of \"time-boxed freak outs\" has always stuck with me. A few times a year I get overwhelmed. I think we all do to some extent. Often I'd try to fight it, don't cry, don't get overwhelmed.</p> <p>But I remembered what my Mom said and I started <em>being present </em>in the freak out. I'd set a timer for 10 or 15 minutes and REALLY own it. Get upset, cry, and not feel bad about it. </p> <p>I deserve the release and by time-boxing it, it allowed me to own it and accept it. I can ramp up, and then ramp down. I've found this to be far more healthy than trying to swallow feelings and hold it in. Sometimes it needs to be OK to go and cry in your car in the parking lot.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> I am not a doctor. I'm a random person and this is my random blog. This advice works for me and has worked for others, but know yourself and talk to a therapist if you are having uncontrollable panic attacks or feel unsafe. If this doesn't sound helpful, be present and be safe.</p></blockquote> <p>I <a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://twitter.com/shanselman/status/1370074397483048962\">tweeted about this idea</a> and found a number of replies that also found this technique helpful. Here are some anonymized quotes:</p> <blockquote> <p>âtime boxed panicâ I love it. Donât skip the feelings. You canât. You just defer them often to disastrous results. Sit with the discomfort a while. The way out is through.</p></blockquote> <p>and</p> <blockquote> <p>Great advice. For some reason, we have been taught to suppress emotions, not to let things get to us and to not panic. And unfairly, men in particular have been encouraged not to show emotion. But it is a natural human response. Give yourself permission to feel &#38; time box it.</p></blockquote> <p>and</p> <blockquote> <p>This is a phenomenal idea. I would add, if you could add a few more minutes, take a walk away from whatever is stressing to clear your head. Sometimes being away from what is causing the stress can help as a reset.</p></blockquote> <p>and finally</p> <blockquote> <p>You don't even have to cry or freak out. Just give yourself a time box to sit, stare, and clear your mind. No phones, no distractions. We have too much swirling in our heads.</p></blockquote> <p>Again, as with all random internet advice, you are under no obligation to do anything you don't feel is safe for you.

There may just be 5 or 6 of us with this issue, but if you're that person, this blog post is for you! Welcome to the solving of the issue you just googled for.</p> <p>I recently bought an Elgato Key Light, and when I purchased it I did not realize that it did not have any external controls. You can only control the light with Wi-Fi and remotely. Personally I think that's a product flaw, this means I'm always going to have to be dependent on their software, and I can't just turn the thing to another level or color with a button. </p> <p>The biggest issue with this light - and other picky IoT devices - is that it doesn't like my network. It happens to be the one and only device on my Ubiquiti network that doesn't seem to want to get along with the others in the house. It uses multicast DNS in the form of Apple's weirdo Bonjour service to broadcast itself, and it's notoriously hard to get the Elgato Control Center software to find the light. I know it's on the network, I can see its IP.</p> <p>There's lots of blog posts with folks trying to solve this issue, and if you found your way to this blog post I figure that you've already done the obvious things like opening the firewall, turning on multicast DNS at the router level, and now you're just sick of it. </p> <p><strong>Here's my brute force solution that made my Key Light show up in Control Center.</strong></p> <p>First, I'm assuming a few things:</p> <ul> <li>That you got the Elgato Key Light on to your network and you can find its IP Address.</li> <li>That you installed the Elgato Control Center software on your PC</li></ul> <p>I put <a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://gist.github.com/shanselman/2cae20d12429573405838739afe165eb\">my Settings.xml file in this gist</a> but the salient points are the SerialNumber and the IpAddress. You'll find the Serial Number on a sticker on the back of the light. You'll find the IP address in your router's IP table. </p> <p><img title=\"My Elgato Key Light's IP Address\" style=\"display: inline\" alt=\"My Elgato Key Light's IP Address\" src=\"https://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/9f7c0108b8ca_12E00/image_db0f2ed3-e1b3-40a9-92ff-415271bb0e27.png\" width=\"676\" height=\"62\"></p> <p>Go to this folder on your PC</p> <p><code>C:\\Users\\YOURNAME\\AppData\\Roaming\\Elgato\\ControlCenter</code></p> <p>Make a copy of the settings.xml in that folder so you don't blame me with this whole affair goes horribly wrong.</p> <p>This is not the complete settings.xml, <a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://gist.github.com/shanselman/2cae20d12429573405838739afe165eb\">again that's in the gist</a>, but this was the missing piece for me.</p><pre class=\"brush: xml; gutter: false; toolbar: false; auto-links: false;\">&#60;Accessories&#62;\n<br>  &#60;Accessory&#62;\n<br>    &#60;Name&#62;Elgato Key Light Air E424&#60;/Name&#62;\n<br>    &#60;UserDefinedName /&#62;\n<br>    &#60;UniqueID&#62;Elgato Key Light Air E424 (3C:6A:9D:15:5E:B6)&#60;/UniqueID&#62;\n<br>    &#60;IsHidden&#62;false&#60;/IsHidden&#62;\n<br>    &#60;HostName&#62;elgato-key-light-air-e424&#60;/HostName&#62;\n<br>    &#60;IpAddress&#62;192.168.1.44&#60;/IpAddress&#62;\n<br>    &#60;DNSSuffix&#62;localdomain&#60;/DNSSuffix&#62;\n<br>    &#60;ServiceType&#62;_elg._tcp&#60;/ServiceType&#62;\n<br>    &#60;Manufacturer&#62;Elgato&#60;/Manufacturer&#62;\n<br>    &#60;Model&#62;Elgato Key Light Air 20LAB9901&#60;/Model&#62;\n<br>    &#60;DeviceType&#62;200&#60;/DeviceType&#62;\n<br>    &#60;LightStripIsTemperatureColorSelected&#62;false&#60;/LightStripIsTemperatureColorSelected&#62;\n<br>    &#60;DeviceSettingsLightStripIsTemperatureColorDefault&#62;false&#60;/DeviceSettingsLightStripIsTemperatureColorDefault&#62;\n<br>    &#60;SerialNumber&#62;CW39J1A17111&#60;/SerialNumber&#62;\n<br>  &#60;/Accessory&#62;\n<br>&#60;/Accessories&#62;</pre>\n<p>Change the Elgato Settings.xml to include YOUR light's serial number and IP address.

Hope this helps both of you with this problem I had!</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Sponsor:</strong> The No. 1 reason developers choose Couchbase?

My most recent one <a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://www.hanselman.com/blog/building-the-ultimate-developer-pc-30-the-parts-list-for-my-new-computer-ironheart\">was in 2018</a> and I'm happily still using it today. However, I have made a few modest and somewhat low-cost (and one high-cost) upgrades. Each of these upgrades means I'll get another 3 to 5 lovely years out of this desktop machine. I'll be using Amazon referral links below, and you are supporting my writing when you use them, thanks!</p> <p>The #1 thing I'm thankful for is that the <a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://amzn.to/3tH3JF2\">ASUS ROG Strix X299-E Gaming II ATX Gaming Motherboard</a> (Intel X299) I purchased three years ago was such a solid choice. It has/had ample memory slots, two (the new one has 3!) m.2 hard drive slots, and it's a large size for future video cards. I'm putting upgrades into this motherboard that didn't exist when I purchased it and it's doing great. If you can, always stretch the budget for a roomy motherboard - you can save up for the upgrades over the coming years like I did.</p> <p>These are the upgrades I've made over the last year.</p> <h3>New SSD - Low Cost and High Availability </h3> <p>Upgrading your hard drive is a huge benefit and relatively inexpensive upgrade. I originally had a <a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://amzn.to/3r5HS8C\">Western Digital Black 512GB SSD using</a> an m.2 interface. This was my first \"hard drive that doesn't look like a hard drive,\" and I still find m.2 drives to be basically impossibly amazing.</p> <p>I noticed that my Drive Health, per CrystalDiskInfo was in the low 60%s and the ATTO Benchmark was getting weak on the writes.</p> <p>I upgraded to a <a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://amzn.to/3tH3lWS\">Samsung 970 EVO Plus SSD m.2 NVMe for just $165</a>. This drive is double my original's space and nearly 3-4x the perf in some places. Plus, the Samsung Drive Migration software just worked. I literally added this drive to my second m.2 slot, ran the migration, shut down, moved the drive to the first m.2 and removed the old drive, and rebooted. I didn't get a single complaint from Windows.</p> <p>This is NOT a sponsored post. This product and technique just worked and I'm thrilled. You may also be able to get a similar result from <a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://clonezilla.org/\">Clonezilla</a> and another drive, but I was very much impressed with Samsung and this upgrade.</p> <p>Here's the before and after benchmark between the 2018 WDC m.2 SSD and the new Samsung EVO Plus SSD.</p> <p>Before:</p> <p><img title=\"atto wdc\" style=\"display: inline\" alt=\"atto wdc\" src=\"https://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/Consider-upgrading---a-good-SSD-is-so-fa_116FA/atto%20wdc_66d94467-c8e5-4299-88fe-90887703a3b1.png\" width=\"527\" height=\"652\"></p> <p>After:</p> <p><img title=\"samsung\" style=\"display: inline\" alt=\"samsung\" src=\"https://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/Consider-upgrading---a-good-SSD-is-so-fa_116FA/samsung_c360e23d-ae5c-49de-b90f-aca406c3f8d2.png\" width=\"527\" height=\"652\"></p> <p>Comparing this drive to my D: and E: spinning rust (regular) hard drives is the difference between shooting a bullet and throwing it. This SSD is 10x faster than a regular drive.</p> <p><a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://amzn.to/3tH3lWS\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"display: inline\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/Consider-upgrading---a-good-SSD-is-so-fa_116FA/image_2d7455af-93d3-4d47-8f36-ded5f70c048a.png\" width=\"748\" height=\"632\"></a></p> <h3>Memory - Medium Cost and High Availability </h3> <p>I had 32 gigs of RAM since 2018 but randomly (I know, this is silly) while cleaning my PC noticed I had four memory slots unused. I *did* know this when I bought it but I just flaked or forgot I had the extra space.</p> <p>I could have gone to Crucial.com but found the <a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MSBS0UT/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&#38;psc=1&#38;tag=diabeticbooks-20\">exact model of memory stick from 3 years ago and picked up another 32 gigs for $200</a>.</p> <p>While upgrading, I also noticed (with help from Twitter) that I wasn't running the XMP memory profile and running these at 3200Mhz. I was running them at 2133Mhz all this time! Doh. So a nice upgrade and one small switch in the BIOS and I've got 64 gigs PLUS I'm clocking nearly 50% faster.</p> <p>This has improve performance for me when running Docker and Kubernetes locally along site, Teams, VS, VS Code, Outlook, you know the drill. I usually sit around 35-50 gigs committed when really working with everything open.

I used an online bot to look for stock drops of the new <a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://amzn.to/39iM4fd\">NVidia 3080 video cards</a> and got one near Christmas. I've also heard good things about the waiting list at Evga.com.</p> <p>This card was $699 which was a significant outlay and I went back and forth on it before I decided to go for it. It's proven to be a great upgrade, particularly as an upgrade <a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~youtube.com/shanselman\">for video rendering for my YouTube</a> as Adobe Premiere uses it a lot.</p> <p>I really hope that this card and the more affordable 3060 are more available soon because it's a lovely upgrade.</p> <p><a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://amzn.to/39iM4fd\"><img title=\"NVidia 3080\" style=\"display: inline\" alt=\"NVidia 3080\" src=\"https://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/Consider-upgrading---a-good-SSD-is-so-fa_116FA/EVGA-GeForce-RTX-3080-FTW3-Ultra-2_ddfdd81d-d9e9-4068-94e3-508dbb0f221f.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\"></a></p> <p>Take a look at your desktop motherboard and consider your possible upgrades based on cost, availability, and performance and see what you could put together at a reasonable budget!
