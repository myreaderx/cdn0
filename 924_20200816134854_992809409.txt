Are your image dimensions to scale? Are you running the right type of ad? If we're being honest, it can get a little confusing.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>With more than <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/264810/number-of-monthly-active-facebook-users-worldwide/\">2.6 billion people</a> using Facebook every month,&nbsp;and nearly <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/346167/facebook-global-dau/\">1.7 billion users</a> every day, Facebook offers up a unique opportunity for marketers to augment their organic efforts. The trouble is, with both an investment of time and money on the line, there's not much room for oversight.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>To help, we've put together a checklist to help you keep all of your campaign details straight. Or watch this short video on how to increase the effectiveness of your ads and budget.

Each ad set can hold a variety of ads that vary in color, copy, images, etc.</li> \n</ol> \n<p>With that terminology out of the way, let's dive in to creating an ad.</p> \n<h3>1. Create an account with Facebook Ads Manager.</h3> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/learn/facebook-ads-reporting-performance/\">Facebook's Ad Manager</a> is a sophisticated dashboard that provides users with an overview of all their campaigns.</p> \n<p>Upfront, the dashboard highlights an estimate of how much you're spending each day. The dashboard is organized by columns, which makes it easy to filter through your ads so you can create a custom view of your results. Key numbers like reach, frequency, and cost are readily available, making reporting on performance a no brainer.</p> \n<p>In order to use the Facebook Ads Manager, you'll need a Facebook Business Page (learn how to set one up <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/5492/how-to-create-a-facebook-business-page-in-5-simple-steps-with-video.aspx\">here</a>). This is because you can't run ads through personal profiles.</p> \n<p>Then, follow these steps:</p> \n<ol> \n <li>Navigate to <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/tools/ads-manager\">https://www.facebook.com/business/tools/ads-manager</a>.</li> \n <li>Click the button that says \"Go to Ads Manager.\"</li> \n <li>Confirm your information on the ad account setup page.</li> \n <li>Set up your payment method.</li> \n <li>Save changes.</li> \n</ol> \n<p>Once set up, the Ads Manager becomes the control center for your Facebook ads.</p> \n<h3>2. Start creating an ad through Facebook's Ads Manager.</h3> \n<p>Once you log into the Ads Manager, you'll see a performance dashboard where all of your campaigns, ad sets, and ads will be listed including the results they've driven for your Facebook page. Unless you've already created an ad for your Facebook page, this dashboard will be empty.</p> \n<p>To create a new campaign, ad set, or ad through the Facebook Ad Manager, tab over to the type of ad you want to create and click the green \"Create\" button to far left of these ad types, as shown below. You can see from this screenshot that we're currently set to create a new <strong>campaign</strong>.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/facebook-ad-manager.jpg?width=690&amp;name=facebook-ad-manager.jpg\" alt=\"facebook ad manager create a new ad button\" width=\"690\" style=\"width: 690px;\"></p> \n<h3>3. Choose an objective.</h3> \n<p>Facebook's Ads Manager, like many social media advertising networks, is designed with your campaign objective in mind. Before getting started, Ads Manager will prompt you to choose an objective for your campaign:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/facebook-ad-campaign-objective.jpg?width=690&amp;name=facebook-ad-campaign-objective.jpg\" alt=\"facebook ad campaign objective\" width=\"690\" style=\"width: 690px;\"></p> \n<p>There are 11 different objectives to choose from. The list includes everything from general brand awareness, to getting installs of your app, to increasing traffic to your online store.</p> \n<p>By choosing one of these objectives, you're giving Facebook a better idea of what you'd like to do so they can present you with the best-suited ad options. As shown in the screenshot above, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/ads-guide/post-engagement/photo/\">Facebook's ad options</a> include:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Brand awareness</li> \n <li>Reach</li> \n <li>Website traffic</li> \n <li>Engagement</li> \n <li>App installs</li> \n <li>Video views</li> \n <li>Lead generation</li> \n <li>Messages</li> \n <li>Conversions</li> \n <li>Catalog sales</li> \n <li>Store traffic</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Let's say, for sake of this blog post, you're looking to drive more traffic to your website. When you select this option, Facebook will prompt you to enter the URL you're looking to promote. If you're using marketing automation software, be sure to create <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-are-utm-tracking-codes-ht?_ga=2.179189668.12369809.1557758544-983944916.1546275206\">a unique tracking URL with UTM parameters</a> for this to ensure that you'll be able to keep track of traffic and conversions from this ad. For HubSpot customers, this can be done using the Tracking URL Builder.</p> \n<p>Once selected, Facebook will then display the ad option that makes the most sense in terms of achieving this objective.</p> \n<h3>4. Choose your audience.</h3> \n<p>Your next step is to configure your target audience -- you can do this for each ad set that belongs to the same campaign. If you're just starting out with paid advertising on Facebook, it's likely that you'll have to experiment with <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/facebook-audience-insights-guide\">several different targeting options</a> until you reach an audience that fits just right.</p> \n<p>To help you narrow your focus, Facebook's targeting criteria are accompanied by an audience definition gauge. This tool -- located to the right of the audience targeting fields -- takes all of your selected properties into consideration in order to come up with a potential reach number.</p> \n<p>If you're wavering between choosing a specific audience over a broad one, consider your objective. If you're looking to drive traffic, you'll probably want to focus on the type of people you know will be interested in your offering. However, if you're looking to build brand awareness or promote a widely appealing offer, feel free to focus on a more general audience.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/00-Blog-Related_Images/Screen_Shot_2015-08-20_at_10.23.53_AM.png?width=669&amp;height=621&amp;name=Screen_Shot_2015-08-20_at_10.23.53_AM.png\" width=\"669\" height=\"621\" alt=\"Audience creation page in the Facebook Ad Manager\"></p> \n<p>Facebook's built-in targeting is vast, including options such as:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Location</li> \n <li>Age</li> \n <li>Gender</li> \n <li>Languages</li> \n <li>Relationship</li> \n <li>Education</li> \n <li>Work</li> \n <li>Financial</li> \n <li>Home</li> \n <li>Ethnic Affinity</li> \n <li>Generation</li> \n <li>Parents</li> \n <li>Politics (U.S. only)</li> \n <li>Life Events</li> \n <li>Interests</li> \n <li>Behaviors</li> \n <li>Connections</li> \n</ul> \n<p>You also have the option to select a Custom Audience -- this allows you to <a href=\"https://mobilemonkey.com/blog/facebook-ads-hubspot-crm\">target people on Facebook who are in your company's contact database</a>, visited a page on your website that has a tracking pixel, or use your app or game. To learn more about how to set up a Custom Audience on Facebook, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/help/170456843145568\">check out these instructions</a>. (And for more on the specifics of these criteria, visit <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/help/433385333434831\">this Facebook targeting resource</a>.)</p> \n<p>Once you find a group that responds well to your ads, Facebook allows you to save these audiences to be used again later -- so you may not need to dive into this step once you've been running Facebook ads for a while.</p> \n<h3>5. Set your budget.</h3> \n<p>Facebook allows you to set either a daily budget or a lifetime budget. Here's how they differ from each other:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Daily budget.</strong> If you want your ad set to run continuously throughout the day, this is the option you'll want to go for. Using a daily budget means that Facebook will pace your spending per day. Keep in mind that the minimum daily budget for an ad set is $1.00 USD and must be <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/help/560163334110364\">at least 2X your CPC</a>.</li> \n <li><strong>Lifetime budget.</strong> If you're looking to run your ad for a specified length of time, select lifetime budget. This means Facebook will pace your spend over the time period you set for the ad to run.</li> \n</ul> \n<img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/facebook-ad-budget.jpg?width=502&amp;name=facebook-ad-budget.jpg\" alt=\"facebook ad budget and schedule page\" width=\"502\"> \n<p>To further specify your budgeting, turn to the advanced options -- this option is linked at the bottom of the screenshot shown above. This section allows you to specify a few things:</p> \n<h4>Schedule</h4> \n<p>Choose whether or not your want your campaign to run immediately and continuously or if you want to customize the start and end dates. You can also set parameters so that your ads only run during specific hours and days of the week.</p> \n<h4>Optimization &amp; Pricing</h4> \n<p>Choose whether or not you want to bid for your objective, clicks, or impressions. (This will alter how your ad is displayed and paid for.) By doing so, you'll pay for your ad to be shown to people within your target audience that are more likely to complete your desired action, but Facebook will control what your maximum bid is.</p> \n<p>If you don't want Facebook to set optimal bids for you, you'll want to opt for manual bidding. This option awards you full control over how much you're willing to pay per action completed. However, Facebook will provide a suggested bid based on other advertisers' behavior to give you a sense of what you should shoot for.</p> \n<h4>Delivery</h4> \n<p>Delivery type falls under two categories: standard and accelerated. Standard delivery will show your ads throughout the day, while accelerated delivery helps you reach an audience quickly for time-sensitive ads (Note: this option requires manual bid pricing).</p> \n<h3>6. Create your ad.</h3> \n<p>What do you want your ad to look like? It all depends on your original objective.</p> \n<p>If you're looking to increase the number of clicks to your website, Facebook's Ad Manager will suggest the <strong>Clicks to Website</strong> ad options. Makes sense, right?</p> \n<p>This ad option is broken down into two formats: Links and Carousels. Essentially, this means that you can either display a single image ad (Links) or a multi-image ad (Carousel) with three to five scrolling images at no additional cost.</p> \n<p>A Links ad will be displayed like this:</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/00-Blog-Related_Images/Single_image.jpg?width=458&amp;height=345&amp;name=Single_image.jpg\" width=\"458\" height=\"345\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" alt=\"Facebook Ad with link to Shop Now\"></p> \n<p>A Carousel ad will be displayed like this:</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/00-Blog-Related_Images/Carosel_Ad.jpg?width=455&amp;height=285&amp;name=Carosel_Ad.jpg\" width=\"455\" height=\"285\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" alt=\"Example of a Facebook Carousel Ad with images of Grand Canyon\"></p> \n<p>Once you decide between the two, you'll need to upload your creative assets. It's important to note that for each type of ad, Facebook requires users to adhere to certain design criteria.</p> \n<p>For single image ads, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/ads-guide/image/facebook-feed/traffic\">Facebook asks that users adhere to the following design recommendations</a>:</p> \n<ul> \n <li class=\"mbm _52if _3m9\">Text: 125 characters</li> \n <li class=\"mbm _52if _3m9\">Ad Headline: 25 characters</li> \n <li class=\"mbm _52if _3m9\">Image ratio: 1.91:1</li> \n <li class=\"mbm _52if _3m9\">Image resolution (including CTA): 1080 x 1080 pixels</li> \n</ul> \n<p>For multi-image ads -- also known as Carousel Ads -- <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/ads-guide/clicks-to-website/carousel/\">Facebook provides the following design recommendations</a>:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Recommended image size: 1080 x 1080 pixels</li> \n <li class=\"mbm _52if _3m9\">Image ratio: 1:1</li> \n <li class=\"mbm _52if _3m9\">Text: 125 characters</li> \n <li class=\"mbm _52if _3m9\">Headline: 40 characters</li> \n <li class=\"mbm _52if _3m9\">Link description: 20 characters</li> \n</ul> \n<div class=\"mbm _52if _3m9\">\n Your image may not include more than 20% text. \n <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ads/tools/text_overlay\">See how much text</a> is on your image.\n</div> \n<p><strong>Keep in mind that these are the ad options for the \"Traffic\" objective.</strong></p> \n<p>If you selected \"boost your posts,\" you'd be presented with different ad options like the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/ads-guide/post-engagement/photo/\">Page Post Engagement: Photo ad</a>. This ad has a unique set of design recommendations. To explore all of the ad options and their design specifics, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/ads-guide/clicks-to-website/links/?toggle0=Photo\">refer to this resource</a>.</p> \n<p>Once you select an ad type, the Ads Manager will prompt you to identify how you'd like to display your ad. The options they provide are as follows: Desktop News Feed, Mobile News Feed, and Desktop Right Column.</p> \n<p>Here's how each ad would appear:</p> \n<h4>Desktop News Feed</h4> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/00-Blog-Related_Images/Screen_Shot_2015-08-20_at_11.29.29_AM.png?width=438&amp;height=474&amp;name=Screen_Shot_2015-08-20_at_11.29.29_AM.png\" width=\"438\" height=\"474\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" alt=\"Facebook Ad with single image on a desktop news feed\"></p> \n<h4>Mobile News Feed</h4> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/00-Blog-Related_Images/IMG_5234.png?width=360&amp;height=640&amp;name=IMG_5234.png\" width=\"360\" height=\"640\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" alt=\"Facebook ad with single image on mobile news feed\"></p> \n<h4>Desktop Right Column</h4> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/00-Blog-Related_Images/Screen_Shot_2015-08-20_at_11.29.03_AM.png?width=245&amp;height=233&amp;name=Screen_Shot_2015-08-20_at_11.29.03_AM.png\" width=\"245\" height=\"233\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" alt=\"Facebook Ad with single image on desktop right column\"></p> \n<p>Be aware if your ad isn't associated with a Facebook page, you'll only be able to run Desktop Right Column ads. To leverage all three display locations, you can <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/5492/How-to-Create-a-Facebook-Business-Page-in-5-Simple-Steps-With-Video.aspx?_ga=2.106969602.12369809.1557758544-983944916.1546275206\">learn how to create a Facebook Page here.</a></p> \n<h3>7. Monitor your ad's performance metrics.</h3> \n<p>Once your ads are running, you'll want to keep an eye on how they're doing. To see their results, you'll want to look in two places: the Facebook Ad Manager and your marketing software.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/help/510910008975690\">According to Facebook</a>, here are some of the key metrics to look for (and their definitions):</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Performance. </strong>Can be customized further to include metrics like results, reach, frequency and impressions</li> \n <li class=\"fcb\"><strong>Engagement.</strong> Can be customized further to include metrics like Page likes, Page engagement and post engagement</li> \n <li class=\"fcb\"><strong>Videos. </strong>Can be customized further to include metrics like video views and avg. % of video viewed</li> \n <li class=\"fcb\"><strong>Website.</strong> Can be customized further to include metrics like website actions (all), checkouts, payment details, purchases and adds to cart</li> \n <li class=\"fcb\"><strong>Apps.</strong> Can be further customized to include metrics like app installs, app engagement, credit spends, mobile app actions and cost per app engagement</li> \n <li class=\"fcb\"><strong>Events.</strong> Can be further customized to include metrics like event responses and cost per event response</li> \n <li class=\"fcb\"><strong>Clicks.</strong> Can be further customized to include metrics like clicks, unique clicks, CTR (click-through rate) and CPC (cost per click)</li> \n <li class=\"fcb\"><strong>Settings. </strong>Can be further customized to include metrics like start date, end date, ad set name, ad ID, delivery, bid and objective</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Regardless of which of these metrics you use to measure the success of your advertising efforts, you can find the data in the Ads Manager.</p> \n<p>As you analyze, you'll be thinking about your data in four main ways, depending on how granular you need to get:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>The account level</li> \n <li>The campaign level</li> \n <li>The ad set level</li> \n <li>The ad level</li> \n</ul> \n<h4>The Account Level</h4> \n<p>This gives a high-level view of performance across all campaigns. You'll find aggregate data that gives you a bird's eye view.</p> \n<p>Simply navigate to the ads manager and click Account Overview. From there, you'll be able to customize the metrics you want to see drill down time ranges, and more.</p> \n<h4>The Campaign, Ad Set, or Ad Level</h4> \n<p>You can also get far more specific with your analysis by checking the performance of campaigns and even down to individual ads. This can help you figure out which messaging, audiences, and collateral are resonating the best.</p> \n<p>All you have to do is navigate to the Campaigns, Ad Sets, or Ads tabs next to Account Overview in the ads manager.</p> \n<h3>8. Reporting on Facebook ad performance.</h3> \n<p>You can receive custom reports via email as well. Here's how to set it up:</p> \n<ol> \n <li>Navigate to Analyze and Report through the upper main menu.</li> \n <li>Choose Ads Reporting.</li> \n <li>Select Create Custom Report.</li> \n <li>Select and open a saved report.</li> \n <li>Choose Save As next to the save icon. Give your report a name and check Schedule Email.</li> \n <li>Follow the prompts to edit and confirm your reporting preferences.</li> \n</ol> \n<p>While there are certainly a lot of details to keep straight when planning a paid Facebook ad, it's important that you don't lose sight of the big picture. Reporting on clicks and conversions from Facebook is important. However, if you're using URLs with specific UTM codes, you have an opportunity to measure your ads' full-funnel effectiveness <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/analytics?_ga=2.115217543.12369809.1557758544-983944916.1546275206\">using your marketing software</a>.</p> \n<p>Tracking URLs will help your marketing software keep track of how many leads, or better yet, how many customers you've gained from your advertising efforts. This information is useful in determining the ROI of this source, and can also be used to inform your overall <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/facebook-marketing\">Facebook marketing</a> strategy.</p> \n<p>If you're a HubSpot customer using <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/ads\">our ads tool</a>, this process is already taken care of for you. You can also create unique tracking codes for your Facebook campaign by navigating to the Tracking URL Builder on the Reports Home page. All you'll need to do is plug in the URL, attach a campaign, and choose the source you want the URL to be attributed to in your Sources Report.

And while everybody seems to know what <em>not</em> to publish these days, many marketers are asking: what <em>should</em> we put out into a world in the throes of a crisis?</p>  \n<p>It's a conundrum facing countless creators across the globe.</p> \n<p>They're wondering how to be empathetic without being disingenuous. How to offer value without seeming opportunistic. And how to be there for their audience without adding to the noise.</p> \n<p>These are important questions to ask at a time like this. Essential, in fact. But underpinning all of them is a much simpler question that gets to the very heart of what content marketing has always been about. A question that every creator staring at a blank canvas right now should be asking: <em>how can we help?</em></p> \n<p>Because now, more than ever before, audiences are seeking help.</p> \n<h2><span>Increasing Engagement Rates</span></h2> \n<p>Entire industries have been forced into hibernation in recent weeks, but this does not mean audiences' appetites for helpful content has gone away. On the contrary. Consumers are increasing searches for valuable information and engaging with businesses at record rates.</p> \n<p>According to an <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/covid-19-benchmark-data-edition3\">analysis of anonymized data from HubSpot's global customer base</a>, engagement with marketing emails, website traffic, and live chat sessions have all been on the rise, with email open rates an eye-catching 25% higher than pre-pandemic levels.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Content%20Creation%20in%20Times%20of%20Crisis.png?width=1500&amp;name=Content%20Creation%20in%20Times%20of%20Crisis.png\" alt=\"increasing engagement rates\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<p>Meanwhile, traffic to <a href=\"https://academy.hubspot.com/\">HubSpot Academy</a>, our free online training program, has more than doubled in recent weeks, and our <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing\">Marketing Blog</a> has experienced a 40% increase in weekly organic traffic.</p> \n<p>The pandemic has triggered a striking surge in the very thing that many marketers care about most: audience attention. And such a high level of interest in the content companies are sharing, coming at such a sensitive time, places a huge responsibility on marketers to deliver materials that are not only relevant to the current moment, but genuinely impactful, too.</p> \n<p>Those that fall short run the risk of doing damage to their reputation — according to <a href=\"https://www.edelman.com/research/covid-19-brand-trust-report\">Edelman</a>, \"71 percent of consumers agree that if they perceive that a brand is putting profit over people, they will lose trust in that brand forever.\"</p> \n<p>But those that succeed will leave a lasting impression on their audience — according to <a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en/marketing/insights/articles/adapt-the-marketing-strategy-for-covid-19\">Gartner</a>, brands that meet consumer's needs at this time can \"re-establish trust through customer-centric actions.\"</p> \n<p>So, it is not only engagement rates that are high during this crisis. The stakes are high, too. And a situation this unique requires a unique strategy to match.</p> \n<h2>When a Crisis Descends, Pause Before Planning</h2> \n<p>When times of crisis strike, the first thing marketers should think about is what <em>not</em> to do. Planned projects, campaigns, and announcements should be reviewed and postponed if possible. For those assets that are released as planned, it's likely they'll need a new tone that's appropriate for the new environment.</p> \n<p>Marketers should examine every article, email, ad, and social media post scheduled to be published to ensure that the tone of each asset is empathetic and respectful.</p> \n<p>If this sounds like a lot of work, it's because, in many cases, it is. No one team can manage a company-wide content audit alone.</p> \n<p>Communications teams have expertise in developing messaging, social media teams have deep connections to their online community, email marketing teams have a strong understanding of brand tone, and customer-facing teams, including sales to service, have their fingers on the pulse of how customers are feeling — all of these teams should be consulted on content strategy during a crisis to ensure that a consistent and helpful approach is adopted across every touchpoint with the public.</p> \n<p>At HubSpot, before we began creating new content for the new environment, we significantly reduced the frequency of our social media posting, dialed back the promotion of a major product launch (<a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/cms\">CMS Hub</a>), and created a centralized set of guidelines on how we as a company should be communicating during this crisis.</p> \n<p>Making such sweeping adjustments on short notice isn't simple, but for us, two things helped make it easier.</p> \n<p>First, we have an established decision-making process for crisis communications that minimizes confusion in the moment.</p> \n<p>Second, by centralizing all of our customer interactions in a shared CRM, we're able to see what communications customers are getting and roll out adjustments quickly to marketing, sales, and service.</p> \n<h2>Creating New Content in Times of Crisis</h2> \n<p>When it comes to creating new content during a crisis, marketers' sole focus should be on delivering work that is genuinely helpful to their audience, without being opportunistic or adding more noise to a topic that has already been widely covered by others.</p> \n<p>According to research conducted by <a href=\"https://www.edelman.com/research/covid-19-brand-trust-report\">Edelman</a>, 85% of people expect companies to use their power to educate their audiences during the COVID-19 crisis. For some companies, that could mean writing in-depth articles that offer expert advice on relevant topics or aggregating publicly available information to make it more accessible for readers.</p> \n<p>Intuit, for example, did this well when they teamed up with GoFundMe to create a <a href=\"https://quickbooks.intuit.com/small-business/coronavirus/\">Small Business Relief Initiative</a> and when they built an <a href=\"https://aidassist.intuit.com/app/home#/home\">interactive tool</a> to help small businesses learn if they are eligible for government-provided financial relief.</p> \n<p>We saw similarly helpful content from Care.com, whose team leveraged their deep knowledge of caregiving best practices to share <a href=\"https://www.care.com/c/stories/16747/navigating-covid-19-care/\">expert advice</a> on the precautions for families and caregivers facing the global health crisis.</p> \n<p>These powerful examples directly address the situation at hand. But for other companies, providing helpful content could mean offering an alternative to the cacophony of crisis-centric content flooding feeds all day, every day.</p> \n<p>For example, NPR has unsurprisingly witnessed a spike in listenership to its news shows as people seek up-to-date, reliable information as the pandemic evolves. But it has also seen a 120% increase in weekly visits to its <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/series/tiny-desk-concerts/\">Tiny Desk Concerts</a> — an entertainment series — indicating that audiences are not only interested in information directly about the crisis, but are also desiring content that provides an escape from it.</p> \n<p>This should make content marketers feel encouraged.</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>It suggests that help can take many forms in the midst of a crisis and that there are multiple ways creators can add value to the lives of their audiences at this time.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>For marketing teams that don't have the necessary resources to create new content given the trying economic environment, there are still creative ways to adapt to audiences' needs. Gathering together old content that's relevant to the current situation, updating it as needed, and presenting it as an easily digestible ebook or content series can be efficient ways of overcoming resource shortages.</p> \n<p>At HubSpot, we did just this when we published <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/topic-learning-path/remote-work\">a new landing page featuring all of our articles about remote work</a> to offer some timely support to companies and employees adjusting to the new normal of working from home.</p> \n<p>During times of crisis, there are a number of ways for marketers to approach new content creation — some that directly address the unique environment at hand, others that look to complement the new patterns of behavior that are emerging — but the one thing that should be consistent is an honest effort to help.</p> \n<h2>Choose Channels Carefully, Distribute Delicately</h2> \n<p>Marketers have an abundance of options for how they distribute their work, but just because we <em>can</em> publish content on multiple channels doesn't always mean that we <em>should</em>.</p> \n<p>Our research tells us that marketing email send volumes have <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/covid-19-benchmark-data-edition4\">increased significantly in recent weeks</a>, meaning that subscribers' email inboxes are even busier than usual. As well-intentioned as a new article or video might be, if it isn't distributed delicately and at a considerate cadence, it could end up doing more harm than good in a company's efforts to help audience members.</p> \n<p>Marketers should reserve their most intimate communications channels, like email and push notifications, for key content updates during a crisis and adopt more subtle distribution approaches for their more niche materials.</p> \n<p>For example, an SEO-optimized article that's easily discoverable through search may be a more appropriate way to share certain new content offerings than a direct email or paid social media post, both of which could come across as excessively promotional or tone-deaf.</p> \n<p>At HubSpot, when the pandemic was declared, we cut our social media posting by approximately 50% in the first week and reduced the number of ads we were sending to avoid overloading our audience with information at a time when there's already a lot to process.</p> \n<p>And when we developed a new educational content series, <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/adapt2020\">Adapt 2020</a>, we made clear to potential subscribers what type of content to expect, as well as where and when it would be distributed.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Content%20Creation%20in%20Times%20of%20Crisis-1.png?width=1500&amp;name=Content%20Creation%20in%20Times%20of%20Crisis-1.png\" alt=\"content marketing adapt 2020 campaign\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<p>The Adapt series became the cornerstone of our content strategy during the current crisis and provided a powerful proof point of the value of the diverse app ecosystem that's deeply integrated with HubSpot's suite of tools.</p> \n<p>With Looker we've been able to share regular updates on shifting trends in sales and marketing, with Canva we've been able to quickly design on-brand assets to promote upcoming webinars, and with Slack we've been able to collaborate with confidence on all of the elements that make up the weekly content series.</p> \n<p>With distribution channels and cadence established with our subscribers, we have been able to turn our attention towards monitoring how the crisis and the needs of our audience are evolving from week to week.</p> \n<h2>Adapt Early, Adapt Often</h2> \n<p>Crises are unpredictable by nature. And what was deeply valuable to audiences last week, may be irrelevant by the next. To provide helpful content for the duration of a crisis, marketers should prepare to continually evolve their strategy in line with their audiences' shifting needs.</p> \n<p>Choosing the right metrics to monitor is key to not falling behind the pace of change. Creators should closely monitor metrics that indicate engagement — such as 'average time spent on page' for articles and show-up rates for webinars — to gain an insight into whether or not their new content is resonating with audiences. And from there, they can use those learnings to look for ways to improve the relevance and helpfulness of their next offering.</p> \n<p>At HubSpot, we initially focused on delivering content aimed at helping businesses to set up virtual events and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/topic-learning-path/remote-work\">adapt to the new normal of remote work</a>.</p> \n<p>We then quickly shifted focus to creating content to help businesses take advantage of new relief measures available by publishing the <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/en-us/coronavirus-response\">pricing and packaging changes we've made</a> along with an<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/us-stimulus-package\"> </a><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/us-stimulus-package\">overview of the U.S. Stimulus Package</a>.</p> \n<p>Following that, we shifted focus to creating content to help businesses adjust their medium- and longer-term strategies and prepare for the post-pandemic economy.</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>We have never witnessed such sudden and dramatic shifts in what audiences need, and the marketers that are nimble enough to adapt their strategy quickly are the ones most likely to provide meaningful help for the duration of the crisis at hand.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>And by doing so, they stand to establish long-lasting levels of loyalty with their audience.</p> \n<h2>What Content Marketing Has Always Been About</h2> \n<p>It's no secret that consumers' trust in companies has been dwindling in recent years. According to <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service/customer-acquisition-study\">HubSpot Research</a>, 55% of people no longer trust the companies they buy from as much as they used to, and 71% do not trust sponsored ads on social networks.</p> \n<p>However, times of crisis create unique environments and unexpected outcomes, one of which can be the recovery of some of that lost trust, and the deepening of long-term relationships between consumers and companies.</p> \n<p>Audiences are turning in record numbers to businesses for resources, information, and support. Customers are taking to social media to rally support for their favorite businesses. And content marketers are returning to first principles and re-establishing helpfulness at the heart of their strategies.</p> \n<p>There are many challenges facing businesses at this time — content strategy is just one of them — but I am hopeful that marketers adopting the advice outlined here will see their efforts rewarded in the form of closer relationships with the audiences, and the fulfillment of knowing they've provided help when it's been needed the most.</p> \n<p>After all, that's what content marketing has always been about.</p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fcontent-marketing-playbook-for-times-of-crisis&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 12 Aug 2020 10:00:00 +0000","feedId":924,"bgimg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/content-marketing-2020.jpg#keepProtocol","linkMd5":"c5760aa0fc813a19a26af70839ac7c61","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn15@2020_2/2020/08/16/13-48-27-421_29b1ce9b289228a5.webp","metaImg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/content-marketing-2020.jpg#keepProtocol","author":"manderson@hubspot.com (Meghan Keaney Anderson)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Content%20Creation%20in%20Times%20of%20Crisis.png?width=1500&name=Content%20Creation%20in%20Times%20of%20Crisis.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn95@2020_6/2020/08/16/13-48-33-576_b3f407fe1f42c77d.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Content%20Creation%20in%20Times%20of%20Crisis-1.png?width=1500&name=Content%20Creation%20in%20Times%20of%20Crisis-1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn55@2020_2/2020/08/16/13-48-33-388_3fae8f649b5c442c.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fcontent-marketing-playbook-for-times-of-crisis&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn20@2020_6/2020/08/16/13-48-34-528_d469ddd1ee8ae4cd.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 21:48:26","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 21:48:26","title":"12 Social Media Tools You Need to Use in 2020","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/social-media-tools","description":"<p>You already know how important <a href=\"https://academy.hubspot.com/courses/social-media?utm_source=marketing_blog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=social_media\">social media </a>is to increase brand awareness, generate more leads, and ultimately score more conversions.</p> \n<p>The world is on social media — <a href=\"https://hootsuite.com/pages/digital-2020\">50% of it</a>, at least — so if you want your product, service, and mission to reach the maximum amount of people, your business needs to be on social media, too.</p>  \n<p>Social media, however, can be extremely time-consuming. Additionally, it spans so many diverse tasks, ranging from number-based activities like tracking analytics, to creative jobs such as designing graphics.</p> \n<p>It can be difficult to find the skills and manpower needed to execute a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/social-media-marketing?_ga=2.148338675.551210183.1559051592-1451183703.1557949920\">good social media strategy</a> — which is why you need social media tools to help you out.</p> \n<p>Here, we'll cover the top 12 <a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/social-media-management/\">social media tools</a> you should be using in 2020 to help you save time and increase conversions.</p> \n<h2>What makes for a good social media tool?</h2> \n<p>Although the term \"social media tool\" is very general and can apply to a wide range of services, there are a few key features each social media tool should have.</p> \n<h3>1. It saves you time.</h3> \n<p>The goal of a social media tool is to save you time while getting similar — or better — results than you could without it. Look for social media tools that automate a process, but make sure the process still happens correctly, since some shortcuts might be too fast and therefore won't focus on quality.</p> \n<h3>2. It helps you increase brand awareness.</h3> \n<p>One of the biggest benefits of social media is its ability to increase your <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/brand-awareness\">brand awareness</a>, which is why each social media tool you select should perform its services with brand awareness in mind.</p> \n<p>Maybe your tool of choice is an editing platform such as <a href=\"http://lightroom.com\">Lightroom</a>, which can help you create images to match the rest of your feed. Or, maybe it's an Instagram scheduler like <a href=\"http://later.com\">Later</a> so you can preview your profile before you post images. Whatever the case may be, social media tools should focus largely on brand awareness.</p> \n<h3>3. It's easy to use.</h3> \n<p>Social media tools are only a time-saver if they're easy and intuitive. Each tool you select should be super user-friendly so that, if needed, your accounting team could edit photos and your creative, right-brained writers could still use the analytics function to track daily social metrics.</p> \n<p>Many social media tools provide tutorials on their websites. Others, such as <a href=\"http://Kicksta.com\">Kicksta</a>, have top-notch customer service so you can get immediate expert advice if you need help getting off the ground.</p> \n<h3>4. It's affordable.</h3> \n<p>Social media tools should be affordable (and most of them are). Many high-quality social media tools are even free, such as the <a href=\"https://unfold.com/\">Unfold</a> app, which is perfect for creating Instagram stories.</p> \n<p>With social media tools, there's no need for you to go back and forth with the accounting department trying to get your budget approved. Most social media tools are already budget-friendly so all you need to do is sign up.</p> \n<h3>5.

If you're like <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/state-of-marketing?__hstc=20629287.baf2406400c73bbe46641b2b9cd8a38f.1563824949326.1584540014200.1584545281370.484&amp;__hssc=20629287.18.1584545281370&amp;__hsfp=3755920611\">almost half of marketers</a>, your answer probably includes ad placement and targeting.</p>  \n<p>As we know, targeted ads are used to find the most qualified leads by showing audiences content that's relevant to them.</p> \n<p>Targeted ads connect you with the leads that are going to be the most interested in what you offer.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>So, how can you be sure that you're generating the <em>most </em>qualified leads with your targeted ads? While there's no sure fire way to tell, there's an optimization strategy you may be missing: behavioral targeting.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/audience-targeting-blog?_ga=2.187036584.1692937882.1597029621-940436819.1565181751\">Targeted advertising</a> allows you to use demographic information, including location or age, to surface ads to relevant audiences. Behavioral targeting uses web behavior as the determining factor, instead of demographics. This increases the impact ads have on audiences.</p> \n<p>Some of the criteria behavioral targeting looks at includes previously visited websites, search history, and past purchases.</p> \n<p>If a marketer spent 20 minutes browsing CRMs, Googling software prices, and reading customer management blogs, behavioral targeting would analyze those actions to show that person ads for a CRM product the next time they visited a site like Facebook.</p> \n<p>Behavioral targeting is used to improve campaign effectiveness. The sales manager weighing their CRM options would likely be more interested in a product ad for one rather than an SEO strategist, making them a qualified lead for the software company.</p> \n<p>Now, let's talk about how behavioral targeting can boost sales. If I were in the market for a social media scheduler and browsed websites like <a href=\"https://www.loomly.com/\">Loomly</a> and <a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/\">Sprout Social</a> before turning to Google, the search engine's behavioral targeting features would show me ads for the sites I visited first.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20Behavioral%20Targeting%20Gets%20Your%20Content%20Seen%20By%20the%20Right%20Audiences.png\" alt=\"a SERP that indicates previous web activity.\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n</div> \n<p>My previous internet behavior told Google what type of sites I'd already visited, so the search engine pulled the top list of options that are related and relevant to my search. And, when I checked my Facebook account a little while later, I saw that my web behavior influenced my ads there, as well:</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20Behavioral%20Targeting%20Gets%20Your%20Content%20Seen%20By%20the%20Right%20Audiences-2.png\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" alt=\"An ad being shown based on behavioral targeting.\">\n</div> \n<p>Pretty cool, right? And to run behavioral targeted ads, you wouldn't have to stray too far from your ad strategy. If your ad host offers targeted options, like <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/ads/ad-targeting\">Facebook</a> or <a href=\"https://business.twitter.com/en/advertising/targeting.html\">Twitter</a> do, create audience segments based on demographics, like location and age. You can also choose psychographics, like interests and values.</p> \n<p>After that, the software will do the work, choosing browsers to show your content based on the preferences you set.</p> \n<p>So, now we know that behavioral targeting helps reach those leads who are intending to make purchases. But what about the potential customers who are in a different stage of their journey?</p> \n<p>Enter: predictive behavioral targeting.</p> \n<p>Behavioral targeting uses website history to show users ads that relate to their interests. Predictive behavioral targeting is a form of analysis — it looks at those targeted ads as a whole, so advertisers can come to conclusions about audience interaction.</p> \n<p>For instance, this is a behavioral targeted ad I came across on Facebook. If I, and others with similar demographics, interact with the ad in the same way, WordStream's advertisers can infer that audiences like me respond well to similar content offer ads.</p> \n<iframe style=\"border: none; overflow: hidden; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\" src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fwordstream%2Fposts%2F10158788220547743&amp;show_text=true&amp;width=552&amp;height=400&amp;appId\" width=\"552\" height=\"400\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> \n<p>Predictive behavioral targeting helps improve the performance of ads for audience segments. It lets advertisers look critically at the similarities of customers and cater to them. This improves the effectiveness of behaviors being targeted.</p> \n<p>If you're still on the fence about using this strategy, don't worry. Let's look at the good and bad of behavioral targeting to help you make your decision.</p> \n<h2>Pros and Cons of Behavioral Targeting</h2> \n<p>There are a <em>lot </em>of ad types to choose from, and it's up to advertisers to choose ones that maximize the effectiveness of campaigns. Like with all types, behavioral targeting has its upsides and downsides. Let's look at a few.</p> \n<h3>Behavioral targeting pros</h3> \n<h4>1. Nurture leads through the buyer's journey.</h4> \n<p>Behavioral targeting helps you fill in the gaps you may have with your ad strategy. If you're seeing excellent <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/measure-content-marketing-roi?_ga=2.14572471.1692937882.1597029621-940436819.1565181751\">ROI</a> from brand awareness ads, but want to drive more conversions from content offer ads, behavioral targeting can help.</p> \n<p>For example, if you're using an ad to promote a new webinar you've hosted, turning on behavioral targeting will increase the ad's chance of reaching audiences who have been looking for webinars like yours.</p> \n<h4>2. Make more sales.</h4> \n<p>Behavioral targeting makes retargeting a better experience for customers. <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/retargeting-campaigns-beginner-guide?_ga=2.14572471.1692937882.1597029621-940436819.1565181751\">Retargeted ads</a> catch website visitors who have abandoned your site without making a purchase. Behavioral retargeting takes that up a notch by crawling more previous web visits.</p> \n<p>When you use behavioral retargeting, your ads will convey a more personalized message to audiences. They’ll remind those who closed your site to visit again with content that's already tailored to their interests.</p> \n<h4>3. Improve the overall customer experience.</h4> \n<p>When you analyze behavioral targeting results, you can begin to draw conclusions about how your audience engages with ads. For instance, if you find that millennial customers are looking for a certain product stack, you can start tailoring your ads in response.</p> \n<p>Behavioral targeting shows customers data-driven ads based on their web behavior. Based on the data you collect from the ads, like click-through rate and conversions, you can tweak the messaging or content of those ads to fit the browsing patterns of your audience.</p> \n<h3>Behavioral targeting cons</h3> \n<h4>1. Behavioral targeting can get costly.</h4> \n<p>Running<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ppc?_ga=2.15081142.1692937882.1597029621-940436819.1565181751\"> pay-per-click ads</a> isn't the most budget-friendly solution. Behavioral targeting falls under that umbrella, and it can get expensive. Make sure to check your advertising budget — and set budget caps — to make sure you have the financial bandwidth to produce ads for the entire campaign.</p> \n<h4>2. Ads can fail without proper audience knowledge.</h4> \n<p>If you don't know your audience, it's likely behavioral targeting won't give you positive results. Generally, the ads are shown based on audience segments you select. But, without proper knowledge of what customers respond to, there's room for lack of resonance from your target market.</p> \n<p>For instance, your buyer persona may be a 30-year-old marketer who's looking for a CRM to make the team she manages more organized. So, you decide to show that portion of your audience a brand awareness ad.</p> \n<p>But, if that ads messaging fails to capture the interest of the majority of your target audience, it won't be very effective. Behavioral targeting finds the right customers, but it's up to your ad to seal the deal. Make sure you're up-to-date with how your target market responds to ads to improve performance.</p> \n<h4>3. Behavioral targeting can lead to an advertising overload.</h4> \n<p>Be wary of producing too many. They can lead to an oversaturation of content and ultimately deter customers from wanting to engage with your ads. As a consumer, if I'm presented with numerous targeted ads from the same companies, I begin to mentally block out any advertising messages from that business.</p> \n<p>Use behavioral targeting sparingly. It'll save you money and catch customers at the right time. Be sure to modify your ad settings so you're not showing users targeted ads every five minutes, just which it's the most impactful.</p> \n<p>Behavioral targeting is just one of the many <a href=\"https://academy.hubspot.com/lessons/optimizing-ads-hubspot\">a</a><a href=\"https://academy.hubspot.com/lessons/optimizing-ads-hubspot?_ga=2.15081142.1692937882.1597029621-940436819.1565181751\">dvertising optimization strategies</a> that are great for <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/beginner-inbound-lead-generation-guide-ht?_ga=2.15081142.1692937882.1597029621-940436819.1565181751\">generating leads</a>.

You probably also have to buy a screen protector and case. But, never fear — The phone store has an array of both from different companies. They are bundled with the phone for a lower price.</p>  \n<p>A phone store that bundles their products with complementary ones is an example of cooperative marketing. This offer takes advantage of products you'd already need to invest in when buying a phone, and uses that to entice you into purchasing.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>That way, instead of spending time and money to make a campaign about the phones a screen protector is great for, the cooperative partnership drives leads and sales in a more organic way.</p> \n<p>Whether the partnership is with direct competitors or complementary ones, all can enjoy the exposure <em>and</em> business a cooperative marketing campaigns offer.</p> \n<p>Now that you have a pretty good idea of how cooperative marketing works, let's look at some examples from companies that have excelled with their campaigns. This strategy leaves plenty of room for experimentation — some can even leverage it as part of their business model.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Let's dive in, below.&nbsp;</p> \n<h2>Cooperative Marketing Examples</h2> \n<p>Cooperative marketing can show up in many different business types. You've most likely seen cooperative marketing in action around you. Let's take a look at examples from other companies for tactics you can use in your own<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/marketing-campaigns?_ga=2.1635313.1179602377.1596518655-940436819.1565181751\"> campaign planning</a>.</p> \n<h3>1. Cafe Integral + Freehand Hotel</h3> \n<p><a href=\"https://freehandhotels.com/\">Freehand Hotel</a> is an independent hotel chain with locations in New York City and Chicago. It promotes business travel in swanky, upscale surroundings. Freehand's locations have a coffee shop built in from local chain <a href=\"https://www.cafeintegral.com/\">Cafe Integral</a>.</p> \n<p>The Freehand website has a page about the coffee shop showing customers the benefits of having a roastery in the lobby of their space:</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/reach%20and%20delight%20(the%20right)%20customers%20with%20cooperative%20marketing-3.png\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" alt=\"Freehand Hotel's website featuring Cafe Integral.\">\n</div> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'times new roman', times;\"><a href=\"https://freehandhotels.com/chicago/cafe-integral/\">Image Source</a></span></p> \n<p>Travelers who need a morning pick-me-up, can enjoy a quick drink from their hotel. They wouldn't have to hop in the rental car for an espresso or walk to the nearest latte. And, if guests have vouchers for a free meal or drink, they're getting coffee included in their room fee.</p> \n<p>If Freehand Hotel guests love the drinks from Cafe Integral, they can visit the standalone in Lower Manhattan, New York, earning the location more loyal customers.</p> \n<h3>2. Snarls + The Sonder Bombs Split</h3> \n<p>A split is a common music industry term to describe two acts coming together on the same release. Audiences can enjoy original and cover versions of each artist's music. They're a great way to discover new music and give musicians new ways to promote their work.</p> \n<p>This split is from label-mates <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/thesonderbombs/\">The Sonder Bombs</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/snarlsband/\">Snarls</a>, and it offers two original songs from each band and two covers of the other's most popular tunes:</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/reach%20and%20delight%20(the%20right)%20customers%20with%20cooperative%20marketing-2.png\" alt=\"The product page for the Snarls and Sonder Bombs split.\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n</div> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'times new roman', times;\"><a href=\"http://www.takethistoheartrecords.com/products/671516-snarls-the-sonder-bombs-a-really-cool-split\">Image Source</a></span></p> \n<p>For one price, audiences get two bands and a chance to hear them play new, exclusive versions of old favorites. They can also hear professional covers from another band that might become their new favorite.</p> \n<h3>3. Vegancuts Snack Box</h3> \n<p>Subscription boxes are another example of cooperative marketing in action. Instead of buying individual products at once, consumers are able to pay one price for a bundle. This allows for the marketing messaging to focus on the value of product discovery.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/reach%20and%20delight%20(the%20right)%20customers%20with%20cooperative%20marketing-1.png\" alt=\"Example of a snackbox from Vegancuts.\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n</div> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'times new roman', times;\"><a href=\"http://vegancuts.com/snackbox\">Image Source</a></span></p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://vegancuts.com/snackbox/\">Vegancuts Snack Box</a>, for example, lets you try snacks from multiple different brands. Usually, there's a variety, like cookies, chips, and candy. While not necessarily a marketing campaign, subscription box companies like this one can capitalize using their <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/business-plan-template?_ga=2.267055182.1179602377.1596518655-940436819.1565181751\">business model </a>as a cooperative marketing tactic.</p> \n<h3>4. Streaming Service Bundle</h3> \n<p>Disney+, a popular streaming service, offers a bundle for customers. For a few dollars more than the standalone subscription price, customers can have access to <a href=\"https://www.hulu.com/\">Hulu</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/\">ESPN</a>. That way, customers can have movies, sports, and shows for one price.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/reach%20and%20delight%20(the%20right)%20customers%20with%20cooperative%20marketing.png\" alt=\"Disney+ bundled services offer.\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n</div> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'times new roman', times;\"><a href=\"https://vegancuts.com/offer/build-up-your-pantry-box/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIger446Hw6gIV64taBR3A5wuIEAYYASABEgJxcvD_BwE\">Image Source</a></span></p> \n<p>Disney's marketers bundling the services invites fans from diverse ages and interests to sign up for the service. Disney is family-friendly, Hulu has original shows and movies, and ESPN is all about sports. Each company can enjoy new subscribers and cross-promotional content from Disney as a result.</p> \n<h3>5. Sony + Naughty Dog Games</h3> \n<p>It's not uncommon for new video game consoles to come with a copy of a popular game so players can learn the controls. For <a href=\"https://www.sony.com/\">Sony's</a> PlayStation 4 release, the pack-in game was Naughty Dog's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncharted_4:_A_Thief%27s_End\">Uncharted 4</a>. This was a great cooperative marketing opportunity between a video game console and a game development company.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/reach%20and%20delight%20(the%20right)%20customers%20with%20cooperative%20marketing-4.png\" alt=\"The PS4 bundle with Uncharted 4.\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n</div> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'times new roman', times;\"><a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/Sony-PlayStation-4-Slim-500GB-Uncharted-4-Bundle-Black-3001504/52901918?wmlspartner=wlpa&amp;selectedSellerId=3651&amp;&amp;adid=22222222227048046159&amp;wl0=&amp;wl1=g&amp;wl2=c&amp;wl3=146648785093&amp;wl4=pla-258790301890&amp;wl5=9002005&amp;wl6=&amp;wl7=&amp;wl8=&amp;wl9=pla&amp;wl10=114431238&amp;wl11=online&amp;wl12=52901918&amp;veh=sem&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIzNnNuqPz6gIVga_ICh3XuQDgEAQYAiABEgKXpvD_BwE\">Image Source</a></span></p> \n<p>Uncharted 4 coming with every new PS4 being sold meant that Naughty Dog's game was being exposed to <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2019/01/11/putting-the-playstation-4s-91-6-million-sales-into-context/#7e66b92a6c50\">millions of players</a>. That's an incredible reach, one that the game company would probably struggle to do on their own.</p> \n<p>Fans got to experience a new game to play with their new console, Sony got to sweeten the console offering, and Naughty Dog earned more leads, making this partnership a home run.</p> \n<h3>6. HubSpot Webinar</h3> \n<p>As part of <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/adapt2020\"><u>Adapt 2020</u></a>, an educational webinar series, \"<a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/advertising-in-a-time-of-crisis?hubs_signup-url=offers.hubspot.com%2Fadapt2020&amp;hubs_signup-cta=null\"><u>Advertising in a Time of Crisis</u></a>\" is a conversation between one of HubSpot's general project managers, <a href=\"http://google.ca\"><u>Google Canada</u></a>'s head of marketing, a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/insights\"><u>Facebook IQ</u></a> lead marketer, and the Director of Paid Media at <a href=\"https://www.wundermanthompson.com/\"><u>Wunderman Thompson</u></a>.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202020-08-04%20at%2012.15.30%20AM.png?width=566&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202020-08-04%20at%2012.15.30%20AM.png\" alt=\"The stream for Adapt 2020's advertising discussion.\" width=\"566\" style=\"width: 566px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">These minds came together to discuss how companies should be advertising, how to shift the messaging of targeted ad campaigns, and how to measure the success of those campaigns.

Sometimes projects gather a few links and then vanish under a pile of other content.</p> \n<p>To compete, you have to ensure the content you're creating, from the idea to the actual execution, is <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/customers/how-to-generate-effective-content-ideas\">compelling</a> enough to earn the coverage and attention you hope it'll achieve.</p> \n<p>And there's one really excellent way to do this: involve a digital PR specialist from the get-go.</p> \n<p>I work in digital PR and have consulted on hundreds of content projects.</p> \n<p>Below, let's review what I've learned about how content creators and digital PR professionals can successfully work together to create engaging, newsworthy content.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h3>1. Recognize viral ideas.</h3> \n<p>Digital PR specialists are responsible for interacting and building relationships with the media, so they likely spend around 70% of their workday online.</p> \n<p>Typically, they're reading new studies, picking apart articles, and getting to know writers. It's only natural that after experiencing the nuances of the news cycle, PR specialists are able to recognize which ideas make it big.</p> \n<p>If that kind of market research already exists in the brains of the outreach specialists on your team, why not utilize it?</p> \n<p>Getting feedback from the birth of a project means the trajectory of the content will be aimed for top-tier coverage. From the idea stage, it may make sense to create a ranking system with your team.</p> \n<p>Outreach specialists can categorize each idea by newsworthiness, relevance, and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-promotion-ideas\">promotional viability</a> to get a better understanding of where your projects stand.</p> \n<p>From there, you can go back to the drawing board or work with your best concepts.</p> \n<p>Using your PR pros will help expand creative ideas from using only what the creative team thinks is interesting to using what publishers think is interesting. Who knows? A single tip from an outreach specialist could turn a mediocre campaign into a huge win for a client.</p> \n<p>For example, at <a href=\"https://www.frac.tl/\">Fractl</a>, one of our biggest recent wins in the career vertical involved pivoting an idea about millennial work/life balance to a survey packed with \"would you rather\" questions.</p> \n<p>This new formatting allowed the creative strategist to ask more hard-hitting questions and challenged millennials to give concrete information about how much they'd be willing to sacrifice in their personal lives in order to get ahead in business. Some of the notable takeaways included:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>More than two in five millennials are willing to end a relationship if it meant getting a promotion at work.</li> \n <li>One in three would dump their S.O. for a raise.</li> \n <li>Millennials put their career before marriage: most are willing to postpone marriage for another seven years if it means they'd land a promotion.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>2. Keep data human.</h3> \n<p>In a recent study from <a href=\"https://www.buzzstream.com/blog/creating-the-most-authoritative-content.html\">BuzzStream and Fractl</a>, consumers ranked data analysis and index as the most authoritative form of online content.</p> \n<p>Those who work in content production are exceptional at analyzing these numbers to reveal their hidden insights. However, it can be easy to get lost in the data while exploring every perspective and lose sight of the most compelling pieces.</p> \n<p>Outreach specialists can help bridge the gap between data and human interest. If there isn't a cohesive narrative weaved throughout your data, a digital PR specialist can pull from their experience in studying what kind of stories emotionally resonate, and can help identify the true story in the data.</p> \n<p>While analyzing data, touch base with your outreach team to develop a storyline. Be sure they identify the simplest ways to digest the information you're trying to get across. If it takes longer than 60 seconds to understand the information in a graph, you're going to lose your audience.</p> \n<p>Oftentimes, content creators become attached to their data and believe every aspect is essential to the piece. While this may be true in some cases, oftentimes slimming down excess information can be beneficial to the narrative as a whole.</p> \n<p>Don't be afraid of feedback, and remember that outreach specialists spend <em>a lot</em> of time dissecting stories online. They're likely a trustworthy editor for your work.</p> \n<p>For example, when presenting repetitive information, it's important to provide interesting visuals to accompany data. When creating infographics about dangerous tools for a home improvement client, our team at Fractl decided to spice up statistics that would otherwise be mundane by placing the information within a tool shed.</p> \n<p>This project ended up being a winner within the home and garden vertical and I owe the promotional viability to the engaging way the information was presented.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/%5BGuest%20Post%20for%20Hubspot%5D%20Why%20A%20Digital%20PR%20Specialist%20Should%20Always%20Be%20Involved%20in%20Content%20Creation.png?width=600&amp;name=%5BGuest%20Post%20for%20Hubspot%5D%20Why%20A%20Digital%20PR%20Specialist%20Should%20Always%20Be%20Involved%20in%20Content%20Creation.png\" alt=\"Infographic helps humanize data.\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<p>If your data tells a story your audience wants to hear, graphs and images become as essential as the words on the page. Using industry knowledge from your outreach specialist's tool belt, you can elevate data-driven content to make it worthy of top-tier press.</p> \n<h3>3. Extract the juiciest takeaways.</h3> \n<p>You have a great idea, you research it, pull all the data, and it falls flat. Sometimes the stories you thought would be told through data don't come to fruition. But this doesn't mean your project is DOA, your outreach specialist may be able to revive it.</p> \n<p>Having an eye on the media means that outreach specialists may be able to extract something from a project that would have otherwise been overlooked. Digital PR pros can draw up some ideal headlines or takeaways to increase the project's chances of appealing to particular publishers and audiences.</p> \n<p>Whether it means tying the data to a trending story or pitching a vertical not initially intended to be a match for your content, there's usually always a way to distill data into a highly promotable headline.</p> \n<p>Chris Lewis, account manager and creative strategist at Fractl, said he incorporates feedback from media specialists into his projects.</p> \n<p>\"Outreach specialists are my secret weapon in creating compelling data-driven story content,\" he said. \"More than anything, they help me get out of my own way by always finding the promotable and most interesting parts of content and finding ways to highlight them.\"</p> \n<h3>4. Create better content.</h3> \n<p>Incorporating feedback from several team members throughout the life of a project can mean improved results from your content marketing efforts.</p> \n<p>Consider hosting collaborative meetings every once in a while or implementing edits from your outreach specialists if an idea falls dry.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, using a digital PR specialist in your content creation will help you create promotable content because of the work with the media and interaction online.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fdigital-pr-specialist-content-creation&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 11 Aug 2020 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":924,"bgimg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/digital-pr-specialist.jpg#keepProtocol","linkMd5":"7254e177cdc584fa16ca62f114c4c6b5","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn11@2020_3/2020/08/16/13-48-27-485_f795c443636f3a02.webp","metaImg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/digital-pr-specialist.jpg#keepProtocol","destWidth":598,"destHeight":398,"author":"Delaney Kline","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/%5BGuest%20Post%20for%20Hubspot%5D%20Why%20A%20Digital%20PR%20Specialist%20Should%20Always%20Be%20Involved%20in%20Content%20Creation.png?width=600&name=%5BGuest%20Post%20for%20Hubspot%5D%20Why%20A%20Digital%20PR%20Specialist%20Should%20Always%20Be%20Involved%20in%20Content%20Creation.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn12@2020_1/2020/08/16/13-48-39-665_ba3466db66c4767b.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fdigital-pr-specialist-content-creation&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn60@2020_4/2020/08/16/13-48-32-267_cc7c73145b6ec61a.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 21:48:25","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 21:48:25","title":"7 Helpful Resources for Creating Beautiful Infographics","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/resources-for-creating-infographics","description":"<p>Visuals have a huge impact in marketing.

(Today, it’s infographics, but there’s a ton of other stuff you can create there, too.)</p> \n<p>Once you’ve let Canva know what you want to do, the site generates several templates you can use as a foundation for your infographic. Plus, it’s got a library of roughly 1,000,000 images that you can add to your project.</p> \n<p>From there, you can edit the text, background image, shapes and other aspects of the infographic to make it your own. And it’s so easy -- here’s a goofy one that I put together on how my dog spends his day:</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Tullamores_Day_Infographic_2.png?width=669&amp;name=Tullamores_Day_Infographic_2.png\" alt=\"Tullamores_Day_Infographic_2.png\" width=\"669\" title=\"Tullamores_Day_Infographic_2.png\" style=\"width: 669px;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><em><a href=\"https://www.canva.com/design/DACA4CZE14s/cbwuFIIiTFB1Zdcq_doPPw/view?utm_content=DACA4CZE14s&amp;utm_campaign=designshare&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_source=sharebutton\">Image Source</a></em> </span></p> \n<h3>2. <a href=\"https://piktochart.com/\">Piktochart</a></h3> \n<p><strong>Cost: </strong>Free, with paid packages available starting at $24/month</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Piktochart2.png?width=669&amp;name=Piktochart2.png\" alt=\"Piktochart2.png\" width=\"669\" title=\"Piktochart2.png\" style=\"width: 669px;\"></p> \n<p>Similar to Canva, Piktochart can be used to design more than just infographics -- it can also build reports, presentations, and posters.</p> \n<p>But the templates available for infographics are numerous, and there’s an upgrade available. “Pro” memberships -- which run between $24 to $80, depending on the features you want -- allow access to even more templates, as well as removed watermarks and hi-res downloads.</p> \n<p>When it comes to creating the infographic itself, the features are fairly similar to Canva’s -- the background, text, and images can all be changed, or users can upload their own files for greater personalization.</p> \n<h3>3. <a href=\"https://venngage.com/\">Venngage</a></h3> \n<p><strong>Cost: </strong>Free, with paid packages available starting at $19/month</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Vanngage.png?noresize&amp;width=600&amp;name=Vanngage.png\" alt=\"Venngage infographic software steps\" width=\"600\" title=\"Venngage.png\" style=\"width: 600px; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>Like its predecessors above, Venngage has quite a few design features, including&nbsp;<span>an </span><a href=\"https://venngage.com\"><span>infographic maker</span></a><span> and&nbsp;</span>its great social media templates, which users can download to create their own personalized Instagram posts, blog headers, and more.</p> \n<p>For infographics, there's a decent range of templates, each categorized by type -- statistical, process, and timeline, to name a few.</p> \n<p>Some of the templates are limited to premium members, reflecting Venngage's four-tiered approach to pricing -- free, premium, education, and non-profit. Plus, there are templates available for those latter two categories. Here's one that helps non-profits visually communicate highlights from an annual report:</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/thumbnails.venngage.com/template/bbc41da5-9284-44d3-a915-bec91ff75f26.png?noresize\" alt=\"Venngage Infographic\" width=\"669\" title=\"Venngage Infographic\" style=\"width: 669px;\"></p> \n<h3>4. <a href=\"https://www.easel.ly\">Easel.ly</a></h3> \n<p><strong>Cost: </strong>Starts at $4/month with special discounts for students and educators.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/easelly.png?noresize&amp;width=600&amp;name=easelly.png\" alt=\"easelly infographic templates\" width=\"600\" title=\"easelly.png\" style=\"width: 600px; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>Upon visiting Easel.ly's website, you're immediately presented with a plethora of infographic templates, most of which can be immediately clicked and customized without having to create an account. If you want to save and share your work, though, you will have to join -- for free.</p> \n<p>Unlike its predecessors listed here, Easel.ly seems to be a no-frills platform that's comprised of infographics. You can choose which category you'd like, but it's not quite as organized as some other sites -- the drop-down menu is a bit hidden to the left of the templates. Still, most of templates appear to be available for free (more become available with a Pro membership), and they're fairly easy to edit.</p> \n<h3>5. <a href=\"http://www.freepik.com\">Freepik</a></h3> \n<p><strong>Cost: </strong>Free, with paid packages available starting at $7.50/month</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/freepik.png?noresize&amp;width=669&amp;name=freepik.png\" alt=\"freepik.png\" width=\"669\" title=\"freepik.png\" style=\"width: 669px;\"></p> \n<p>As its name suggests, Freepik is a resource for, well, free pictures. Infographics are just one type, but after performing a search for them, there are plenty of options -- most of which are complimentary.</p> \n<p>The only drawback? Freepik doesn't quite allow the same level&nbsp;of customization that some others in this list do. You can download the images for free, but you’ll need a vector graphics editor in order to customize them -- Brittany Leaning and Megan Conley of HubSpot's content marketing team both suggest using <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html\">Adobe Illustrator</a>.</p> \n<h3>6. <a href=\"https://infogr.am\">Infogram</a></h3> \n<p><strong>Cost:</strong> A limited number of options available for free, with paid packages available starting at $19/month</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/infogram%20examples-1.png?width=600&amp;name=infogram%20examples-1.png\" alt=\"infogram examples\" width=\"600\" title=\"infogram examples-1.png\" style=\"width: 600px; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>Like many of its visual peers, Infogram is a resource that helps users create both picturesque charts and infographics. It's definitely one of the more \"grown-up\" sites available for building these images, which might explain why very few of their tools a re free -- including restricting your work from public consumption.</p> \n<p>However, Infogram also has the option of enlisting professional help with infographic design. So if you're short on time and have a bit of room in your budget, this route might be the best one for you.</p> \n<h3>7. <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/chart/\">Google Charts</a></h3> \n<p><strong>Cost: Free</strong></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google_charts.gif?noresize&amp;width=600&amp;name=Google_charts.gif\" alt=\"Google_charts gif example\" width=\"600\" title=\"Google_charts.gif\" style=\"width: 600px; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>Okay, maybe a chart isn’t exactly the same as an infographic. But, given the interesting selection templates made available by Google, we would be remiss to exclude it.</p> \n<p>There are a few items of value in Google charts. First, we love the selection of charts available. From animated bubble graphs -- like the one above -- to clever word trees, the features allow users to bring information to life. (I mean, admit it -- adding animation to data always makes it a little less boring.)</p> \n<p>Plus, these charts can be created to be interactive. One of our favorites, GeoCharts, allows data to be assigned to different regions of a map that appear when hovered over. Check it out:</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google_Geo_Charts.gif?noresize&amp;width=600&amp;name=Google_Geo_Charts.gif\" alt=\"Google_Geo_Charts.gif\" width=\"600\" title=\"Google_Geo_Charts.gif\" style=\"width: 600px;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><em><a href=\"https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/geochart\">Image Source</a></em> </span></p> \n<p>We'll admit that some features of Google Charts might be a bit more advanced than the other resources we’ve listed. But, if you’re ready to step up your visuals game, give it a try.</p> \n<h2>Start Creating Infographics</h2> \n<p>There's no shortage of resources when it comes to creating your own visuals -- charts, reports, and infographics. And, depending on your budget and needs, there's a veritable plethora of options available, all of which have their pros, with very few cons.</p> \n<p>Want to learn more about designing brilliant infographics? <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/create-infographics-with-free-powerpoint-templates\">Check out these helpful tips</a>.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fresources-for-creating-infographics&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 11 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":924,"bgimg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/resources-for-designing-infographics.jpg#keepProtocol","linkMd5":"fba938449a6562b793d104947f750ea1","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx20/cdn47@2020_1/2020/08/16/13-48-27-431_d048dc2dbaa8bb3d.webp","metaImg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/resources-for-designing-infographics.jpg#keepProtocol","destWidth":598,"destHeight":398,"author":"Amanda Zantal-Wiener","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Canva-16.png?width=600&name=Canva-16.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn48@2020_4/2020/08/16/13-48-33-759_cfaa08a627856143.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Tullamores_Day_Infographic_2.png?width=669&name=Tullamores_Day_Infographic_2.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn83@2020_5/2020/08/16/13-48-36-828_8516b0a93c76b0c1.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Piktochart2.png?width=669&name=Piktochart2.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn71@2020_3/2020/08/16/13-48-29-645_99f03e97d8ab3710.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Vanngage.png?noresize&width=600&name=Vanngage.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn75@2020_6/2020/08/16/13-48-32-508_773ab0960b65f583.webp","https://s3.amazonaws.com/thumbnails.venngage.com/template/bbc41da5-9284-44d3-a915-bec91ff75f26.png?noresize":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn32@2020_4/2020/08/16/13-48-29-304_eb42a7670a367740.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/easelly.png?noresize&width=600&name=easelly.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn35@2020_4/2020/08/16/13-48-29-651_1b94ce1f79060b1d.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/freepik.png?noresize&width=669&name=freepik.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn47@2020_1/2020/08/16/13-48-34-867_7dfd1560c61ec582.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/infogram%20examples-1.png?width=600&name=infogram%20examples-1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx20/cdn71@2020_3/2020/08/16/13-48-35-007_809907476669fb88.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google_charts.gif?noresize&width=600&name=Google_charts.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn52@2020_6/2020/08/16/13-48-38-455_01640727dad5e3fa.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google_Geo_Charts.gif?noresize&width=600&name=Google_Geo_Charts.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn23@2020_4/2020/08/16/13-48-31-300_1a165a7d66171e7f.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fresources-for-creating-infographics&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx20/cdn63@2020_6/2020/08/16/13-48-32-271_4f9c272a6eea9c51.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 21:48:25","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 21:48:25","title":"The 30-60-90 Day Plan: Your Guide for Mastering a New Job [Template + Example]","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/30-60-90-day-plan","description":"<p>With all the joy and excitement of landing a new job, you can feel just as much fear and anxiety. The same can go for the hiring manager.</p>  \n<p>Overcoming a new role's learning curve and the desire to make a lasting impression on your employer can put a lot of pressure on you. What if you can't adapt in time?</p>  \n<p>Fortunately, there's a way to organize and prioritize your time and tasks, helping you seamlessly adapt to your new environment. It's called a 30-60-90 day plan. And following it enables you to soak in as much information as possible, master your core job responsibilities, and sets you up to make a lasting impact on your new team.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Think of a 30-60-90 day plan as a new employee's North Star, keeping your sights set in the right direction and guiding you toward success. But before we show you how to write this plan, let's go over what exactly it is and how it'll enhance your performance during your (or your employee's) first three months on the job.</p> \n<p>In this post, we'll cover everything you need to know about 30-60-90 day plans whether you're writing one for yourself or a new hire on the team.</p> \n<p>There are two situations where you'd write a 30-60-90 day plan: during the final stages of an interview process and during the first week of the job itself. Here's how each type can be executed:</p> \n<h3>30-60-90 Day Plan for Interview</h3> \n<p>Some hiring managers ask candidates to think about and explain their potential 30-60-90 day plan as a new hire. They want to see if they can organize their time, prioritize the tasks they'd likely take on, and strategize an approach to the job description.</p> \n<p>For a new hire, a well thought-out 30-60-90 day plan is a great way to help the hiring manager visualize you in the role and differentiate yourself from all other candidates.</p> \n<p>Of course, it can be difficult to outline your goals for yourself before you accept a new job. So, how are you supposed to know what those goals are? Start with the job description. Normally, open job listings have separate sections for a job's responsibilities and a job's qualifications. Work to find commonalities in these two sections, and how you might turn them into goals for yourself staggered over the course of three months.</p> \n<p>For example, if a job requires three years of experience in Google Analytics, and the responsibilities include tracking the company's website performance every month, use these points to develop an action plan explaining how you'll learn the company's key performance metrics (first 30 days), strengthen the company's performance in these metrics (next 30 days), and then lead the team toward a better Google Analytics strategy (last 30 days).</p> \n<h3>30-60-90 Day Plan for New Job</h3> \n<p>The second situation where you'd write a 30-60-90 day plan is during the first week of a new job. If you're the hiring manager, this plan will allow you to learn how the new employee operates, address any of their concerns or preconceived notions about the role, and ultimately help them succeed.</p> \n<p>If you're starting a new job, and are not asked to craft a 30-60-90 day plan during the first week of that job, it's still a good idea to write one for yourself. A new job can feel like a completely foreign environment during the first few months, and having a plan in place can make it feel more like home.</p> \n<p>Even though 90 days is the standard grace period for new employees to learn the ropes, it's also the best time to make a great first impression.</p> \n<p>The purpose of your plan is to help you transition into your new role, but it should also be a catalyst for your career development. Instead of just guiding you over your job's learning curve, the goals outlined in your plan should push you to perform up to your potential and raise your bar for success at its every stage.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h2>30-60-90 Day Plan for Managers [Template]</h2> \n<p>Almost all 30-60-90 day plans consist of a learning phase, a contributing phase, and a leading phase — which we'll go over in the example plan below. This includes plans that are designed to guide people in new <em>management</em> roles. What sets apart a <em>manager's</em> plan from any other is their obligation to their direct reports and the decisions they're trusted to make for the business.</p> \n<p>If you're accepting (or hiring for) a new manager role, consider any of the following goals and how to roll them out at a pace that sets you up for success.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/30,%2060,%2090%20Day%20Plan%20Template,%20Blog%20Image.jpg?width=1500&amp;name=30,%2060,%2090%20Day%20Plan%20Template,%20Blog%20Image.jpg\" alt=\"free editable 30 60 90 day plan template\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<h3>Get to your know your team's strengths and weaknesses.</h3> \n<h4>Recommended phase: First 30 days</h4> \n<p>Everyone is learning the ropes in their first month at a company. For managers, much of that learning happens by talking to the team.</p> \n<p>If you're a new manager, grab some time with your direct reports and get to know their roles. What do they like about them? What are their biggest pain points?</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.projectmanager.com/blog/5-goals-of-effective-managers\">Making your team happy</a> is a hard goal to measure, but it's an important responsibility to take on as a manager. Your first step is to figure out how you'll manage and coach your employees through their day-to-day work.</p> \n<h3>Improve the cost-effectiveness of your team's budget.</h3> \n<h4>Recommended phase: Final 30 days</h4> \n<p>Managers often have access to (and control over) the budget for their department's investments — things like software, office supplies, and new hires. After you spend the first couple of months learning what the team spends its money on, consider using the final 30 days of your plan to make suggestions for new investments or how to reallocate money where you think it needs to be.</p> \n<p>Is there a tool that can automate a task that's taking your team forever to do manually? Draft a financial strategy that includes this tool in the following quarter's budget.</p> \n<h3>Help a direct report acquire a new skill.</h3> \n<h4>Recommended phase: Second 30 days</h4> \n<p>Even though you're new to the company, you were hired for a reason: You've got skills. And you can bring these skills to the people you work with, particularly those people who report to you.</p> \n<p>After meeting with and learning about your new colleagues, you might use the second month of your on-boarding plan to find skill gaps on your team that you can help fill.</p> \n<p>Do you have expert-level experience with HubSpot, and your new company just started using <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing?_ga=2.73575319.440552189.1554432490-1093622293.1516842654\">HubSpot Marketing Hub</a>? Teach them how to do something in the platform they didn't know before.</p> \n<h3>Draft a training strategy that can help guide your direct reports into new roles.</h3> \n<h4>Recommended phase: Final 30 days</h4> \n<p>You won't be expected to promote people in the first three months of your new job, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't have learned enough about your team to decide who's good at what and how to coach them to where they want to be.</p> \n<p>In the final 30 days of your 30-60-90 day plan, you might agree to a goal to develop a training strategy that outlines how to manage your direct reports, and ultimately how to guide them into new roles in the future.</p> \n<h2>30-60-90 Day Plan for Executives</h2> \n<p>Executives are a little different from managers in that there's higher performance expectations coming in. As an executive, you'll need to be highly engaged with the organization from the first day and implement high-impact changes in your role as soon as you can. At the same time, context is important, and you'll need to understand the culture, team, current operating processes, and challenges before you solve for them.</p> \n<p>Here are some critical steps to include in your 30-60-90 day plan in an executive role.</p> \n<h3>Soak up as much information as possible.</h3> \n<h4>Recommended phase: First 30 days</h4> \n<p>There's no point in taking action without context, so start your ramp-up period by gathering information and charting the lay of the land. That means reviewing existing documentation, attending as many meetings as you can, meeting with direct reports and skip levels, and ask a lot of questions.</p> \n<h3>Create alignment between you and the team.</h3> \n<h4>Recommended phase: First 30 days</h4> \n<p>In the first 30 days, you'll be meeting new people and understanding their roles in the organization. Ultimately, your job as an executive is to set the vision for the organization while removing roadblocks for your team as they strategize and execute on it.</p> \n<p>One of the best questions you can ask as you familiarize yourself and align with your team is, \"In your opinion, what are some existing threats to our business (external or internal)?\"</p> \n<p>This shows that you care about their opinion and trust their expertise while getting unique perspectives from multiple vantage points in the organization. Plus, if you start hearing some of the same points from multiple team members, you'll be able to identify the biggest pains, equipping you to make the highest impact changes.</p> \n<h3>Create goals based on what you've learned.</h3> \n<h4>Recommended phase: Second 30 days</h4> \n<p>When you are interviewing or shortly after you're hired, you'll get a feel for the types of pains that the executive team has and the objectives in mind for bringing you on.</p> \n<p>Once you have more context about how the organization works, you can take this vision and translate it into concrete, measurable goals that will take your department to the next level.</p> \n<h3>Identify the A players on the team.</h3> \n<h4>Recommended phase: First 30 days</h4> \n<p>An A player is a member of your team that goes above and beyond what's expected in their role. While not every employee will be an A player, you'll want to ensure that critical roles and teams have at least one A player to lead, inspire, and strengthen camaraderie.</p> \n<p>From there, you can figure out the existing gaps in staffing and training, whether it's team members who need a lot of guidance and must be coached up to performance or empty roles that need to be filled altogether.</p> \n<h3>Diagnose process issues.</h3> \n<h4>Recommended phase: Second 30 days</h4> \n<p>Companies of all sizes run into operational issues as they implement processes that are efficient and work at scale. Sometimes, when an executive team isn't aligned with middle management, processes can become unwieldy.</p> \n<p>Learn why things are done the way they are and then figure out if there are workarounds you can implement to streamline operations. Perhaps it's as simple as eliminating bottlenecks or adding automation to certain functions.</p> \n<h3>Put together and implement hiring plan.</h3> \n<h4>Recommended phase: Final 30 days</h4> \n<p>You know your A and B players, and you hopefully have a plan to retain, invest in, and mentor them. However, you'll likely come across gaps that you need to fill and positions that need to be created to eliminate bottlenecks. From there, you'll want to create a hiring plan to execute, both for short-term, middle-term, and long-term needs.</p> \n<h3>Effect changes in operations.</h3> \n<h4>Recommended phase: Final 30 days</h4> \n<p>Speaking of bottlenecks, your final 30 days of your plan should be focusing on the areas of the business that can achieve the results the fastest. Once you've identified these, you can focus on removing these roadblocks to start hitting goals and achieving higher performance.</p> \n<h3>Contribute to broader company goals.</h3> \n<h4>Recommended phase: Final 30 days</h4> \n<p>As a member of the executive team, you'll also be looped in one high-level company initiatives, and the other executives of the company will be relying on you to contribute your deep discipline expertise and experience.</p> \n<p>Be ready to lean in on executive meetings and contribute to the vision and strategy of the organization as it moves forward.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>How to Write a 30-60-90 Day Plan</h2> \n<p>No matter what the level of the job for which a company is hiring, improving an employee's skills requires concrete performance goals, so watch out for vagueness in the objectives you set for yourself.</p> \n<p>“Write a better blog post,” or “get better at brainstorming” are terrific ambitions, but they don't give you a way to measure your progress in them. Set goals that are realistic, quantifiable, and focused. You'll know exactly how to achieve them and gauge your success.</p> \n<p>To write challenging yet feasible performance goals, ask yourself the following questions:</p> \n<h3>What are my team's goals?</h3> \n<p>Try to understand the purpose behind your team's goals. It'll give you more insight into why you and your team should achieve them, motivating you to work as hard as possible to meet those goals.</p> \n<h3>What will be my main priorities?</h3> \n<p>By connecting your personal responsibilities to your team's goals, you'll know exactly how to align your tasks with the needs of the team, which keeps you accountable and compels you to help your team achieve their goals.</p> \n<h3>How will I measure my progress?</h3> \n<p>Tracking your progress helps you gauge your performance and rate of improvement. To see how you're doing, set up weekly meetings with your manager to ask her what she thinks of your work and track the improvement of your own performance metrics, like the growth of your blog posts' average views or the amount of qualified leads your eBooks generate.</p> \n<p>Reaching your performance goals isn't the only path toward future success in your new role, though. You also need to study the ins and outs of your team and company, take initiative, and develop relationships with coworkers — all things that a lot of new hires underestimate the importance of.</p> \n<p>Consider setting the following types of goals during each stage of your 30-60-90 day plan:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Learning Goals</strong> - How will you absorb as much information as possible about your company, team, and role?</li> \n <li><strong>Initiative Goals</strong> - What will you do to stand out?</li> \n <li><strong>Personal Goals</strong> - How will you integrate with your company and team?</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Aiming to achieve these types of goals will help you hit the ground running in all the right areas of your job. And if you stick to your plan, you'll notice you'll be able to spend less time learning and more time executing.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>30-60-90 Day Plan Template With Examples</h2> \n<p>Behold, your 30-60-90 day plan template.

Here's an example:</p> \n<h3>30 Days</h3> \n<h4>Primer</h4> \n<p>Many new hires are eager to impress, so they dive head-first into their work or try to make suggestions about their team's process with limited experience in how their new team operates. But have patience.</p> \n<p>Understanding your company's vision and your team's existing strategy is crucial for producing high-quality work and actually making an impact. If you don't know the purpose behind your role or the optimal way to perform, you'll risk missing the mark and your early efforts won't pay off the way you expect them to.</p> \n<p>It's always better to over-prepare than under-prepare. And it's okay to take time to learn the ropes — it pays huge dividends in the long run. In the first 30 days of your employment, your priority is to be a sponge and soak in as much information as possible. Once you do that, you can then try to improve more specific parts of your team's work style.</p> \n<h4>Theme: Be a Sponge</h4> \n<h5>Learning Goals</h5> \n<ul> \n <li>Study my company's mission, vision, and overarching strategy.</li> \n <li>Read my company's culture code to learn more about our company culture and why we implement it.</li> \n <li>Read the customer persona and target audience overview to truly understand who our customers are, their pain points, and how our product and content can help them.</li> \n <li>Meet with my team's director to learn about how meeting our goals will help our business grow.</li> \n <li>Read up on our team's new SEO strategy, editorial process, and traffic goals.</li> \n <li>Learn how to use the SEO Insights Report to plan and structure blog posts.</li> \n <li>Review my team's pillar-cluster model overview and understand how to match posts to clusters.</li> \n <li>Meet with my manager to learn more about her expectations.</li> \n</ul> \n<h5>Performance Goals</h5> \n<ul> \n <li>Complete new hire training and pass the test with a 90% or higher.</li> \n <li>Be able to write 3 blog posts per week.</li> \n</ul> \n<h5>Initiative Goals</h5> \n<ul> \n <li>Run the Facebook Instant Article experiment that my manager recommended me to do.</li> \n</ul> \n<h5>Personal Goals</h5> \n<ul> \n <li>Grab coffee with everyone on my team, so I can get to know them on a professional and personal level.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>60 Days</h3> \n<h4>Primer</h4> \n<p>By the end of your first 60 days, you should ramp up your workload, start overachieving, and make a name for yourself on your team.</p> \n<p>To do this, start speaking up more at meetings. Don't be afraid to share your ideas about improving your team's processes. This shows you're quickly conquering the learning curve and recognizing some flaws that your colleagues might've overlooked. You still have a fresh perspective on the company, so your insight is invaluable.</p> \n<h4>Theme: Be a Contributor</h4> \n<h5>Learning Goals:</h5> \n<ul> \n <li>Learn how to optimize a new post from scratch based on both the SEO Insights Report and my own competitive research.</li> \n <li>Read every other marketing team's wiki page to learn about other marketing initiatives and how our entire department works together to grow our business.</li> \n <li>Deep dive into my company's product roadmap and strategy to fully grasp our mission and vision.</li> \n</ul> \n<h5>Performance Goals</h5> \n<ul> \n <li>Be able to write 5 blog posts per week.</li> \n <li>Be down to one cycle of edits per post.</li> \n <li>Understand how to edit a guest post -- clean up at least one rough draft.</li> \n</ul> \n<h5>Initiative Goals</h5> \n<ul> \n <li>Share content strategy idea at my team's monthly meeting and ask if I can spearhead the project to boost blog traffic.</li> \n <li>Ask my manager if I can oversee Facebook messenger and Slack distribution strategy.</li> \n</ul> \n<h5>Personal Goals</h5> \n<ul> \n <li>Meet with my colleagues on other teams to learn about their marketing initiatives and develop relationships outside of my team.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>90 Days</h3> \n<h4>Primer</h4> \n<p>By the end of your first three months, you should have a firm grasp of your role, feel confident about your abilities, and be on the cusp of making a breakthrough contribution to your team. Instead of reacting to problems that pop up at random, be proactive and spearhead a new initiative for your team.</p> \n<p>You should also be cognizant of how you can collaborate with other teams to improve your own team's processes. By taking on some new projects outside of your main role, you'll start turning some heads and catch the attention of the department at large.</p> \n<h4>Theme: Be a Leader</h4> \n<h5>Learning Goals</h5> \n<ul> \n <li>Do an analysis of my highest and lowest performing blog post up to date. How can I use this information to optimize new content so it performs better out of the gate?</li> \n</ul> \n<h5>Performance Goals</h5> \n<ul> \n <li>Be comfortable with writing five blog posts per week</li> \n <li>Edit one guest post per week</li> \n <li>Try to have 75% of my blog posts not require revisions.</li> \n <li>Write at least one new post that generates over 10,000 views in one month.</li> \n</ul> \n<h5>Initiative Goals</h5> \n<ul> \n <li>Ask SEO team if they want to partner with product marketing team to brainstorm content topics related to our product road map.</li> \n <li>Ask social media team if they're willing to develop a relationship where we can share each other's content.</li> \n <li>Ask sales team what our customers' pain points are, so we can write content that our target audience craves and help them close more qualified leads.</li> \n</ul> \n<h5>Personal Goals</h5> \n<ul> \n <li>Join the yoga club.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Learning the nuances of your new role in less than three months won't be easy. But crafting a strong 30-60-90 day plan is your best bet for accelerating your development and adapting to your new work environment as quickly as possible.</p> \n<p><em>Editor's note: This post was originally published in April 2019 and has been updated for comprehensiveness.</em></p> \n<p></p> \n<div></div>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2F30-60-90-day-plan&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 07 Aug 2020 14:53:00 +0000","feedId":924,"bgimg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/30-60-90-day-plan-2.jpg#keepProtocol","linkMd5":"8a6f144720f7dbd1b6377623ebd539b7","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx17/cdn12@2020_5/2020/08/16/13-48-27-322_9ff7c934c59669cd.webp","metaImg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/30-60-90-day-plan-2.jpg#keepProtocol","destWidth":598,"destHeight":399,"author":"cchi@hubspot.com (Clifford Chi)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/30,%2060,%2090%20Day%20Plan%20Template,%20Blog%20Image.jpg?width=1500&name=30,%2060,%2090%20Day%20Plan%20Template,%20Blog%20Image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn95@2020_4/2020/08/16/13-48-30-822_aee4f44e77411392.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2F30-60-90-day-plan&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn4@2020_3/2020/08/16/13-48-30-893_937e7560f9c90806.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 21:48:26","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 21:48:26","title":"How to Build A Business Plan That Stands Out [Free Template]","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/business-plan-template","description":"<p>Nowadays, it seems like a new company is starting every hour.</p>  \n<p>But, while starting a company may seem easier now than ever before, entrepreneurs have an uphill battle from the moment they start a business. On average, a new business will need to compete with <a href=\"https://www.dmnews.com/data/article/21048500/business-is-becoming-more-competitive\">25 competitors</a> in order to stand out and thrive in its industry.</p> \n<p>Aspiring business owners that go in blind without a clear, actionable plan for marketing, hiring, finances, and operations are destined to face significantly more difficulties on their journey to building a successful company — which is why crafting a <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/business-plan-template?hubs_post-cta=body\">business plan</a> is an essential step in the entrepreneurial process.</p> \n<p>In this post, we’ll walk you through the process of filling out your <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/business-templates/one-page-business-plan?hubs_post-cta=imagesir\">business plan template, like this free, editable version</a>:&nbsp;</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/One-Page%20Business%20Plan%20Template.jpg?width=1500&amp;name=One-Page%20Business%20Plan%20Template.jpg\" alt=\"free editable One-Page Business Plan pdf  Template\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/business-plan-template?hubs_post-cta=imagesir\"><em>Download a free, editable one-page business plan template.&nbsp;</em></a></p> \n<p>This way, you’ll be able to show them how organized and well-thought-out your business idea is, and provide them with answers to whatever questions they may have.</p> \n<p>When looking at a blank page on a laptop screen, the idea of writing your business plan can seem impossible. However, it’s a mandatory step to take if you want to turn your business dreams into a reality.</p> \n<p>That’s why we’ve crafted a business plan template for you to download and use to build your new company. <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/business-plan-template?hubs_post-cta=body\">You can download it here for free</a>. It contains prompts for all of the essential parts of a business plan, all of which are elaborated on, below.</p> \n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Featured Resource: <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/business-plan-template?hubs_post-cta=body\">Free Business Plan Template</a></h3> \n<p><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/business-plan-template?hubs_post-cta=image\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/bpt-cover-gif.gif?width=409&amp;name=bpt-cover-gif.gif\" alt=\"bpt-cover-gif\" width=\"409\" style=\"width: 409px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></a></p> \n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/business-plan-template?hubs_post-cta=imagebottom\">Download this Template</a></span> \n<h3>1. Cover Page</h3> \n<p>Your business plan should be prefaced with an eye-catching cover page. This means including a high-resolution image of your company logo, followed by your company’s name, address, and phone number.</p> \n<p>Since this business plan will likely change hands and be seen by multiple investors, you should also provide your own name, role in the business, and email address on the cover page, as well.</p> \n<h3>2. Executive Summary</h3> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/executive-summary-examples\">executive summary</a> of your business plan should provide a one or two page overview of the business and highlight the most crucial pieces of information for readers. Intended to grab the reader’s attention, this section should summarize critical information regarding your company overview and upcoming short-term and long-term goals.</p> \n<p>The executive summary is essentially a boiled-down version of your entire business plan, so remember to keep this section to-the-point and filled only with essential information.</p> \n<p>Typically, this brief section includes:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>A mission statement.</li> \n <li>The company's history and leadership model.</li> \n <li>An overview of competitive advantage(s).</li> \n <li>Financial projections.</li> \n <li>Company goals.</li> \n <li>An ask from potential investors.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>3. Company &amp; Business Description</h3> \n<p>In this section, you’ll provide a more thorough description of what your company is and why it exists.</p> \n<p>The bulk of the writing in this section should be about your company’s purpose – covering what the business will be selling, identifying the target market, and laying out a path to success.</p> \n<p>In the Company &amp; Business Description portion of your business plan, you can also elaborate on your company’s:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Mission and/or vision statement.</li> \n <li>Core values.</li> \n <li>Team &amp; organizational structure.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>3. Product &amp; Services Line</h3> \n<p>Here’s where you’ll provide a more in-depth overview of the makeup of your business’s product and/or services line. You should provide each product or service’s name, its purpose, and a description of how it works (if appropriate).</p> \n<p>Next, add some color to the sales strategy by outlining your pricing model and mark-up amounts.</p> \n<p>If you’re selling tangible products, you should also provide an explanation of production and costs, and how you expect these factors to change as you scale.</p> \n<h3>4. Market Analysis</h3> \n<p>The market analysis section is where you’ll provide details about the audience to which you’re marketing your business. This should encompass the size of your total addressable market, your market’s demographics and psychographics, and a location analysis for your business’s operating space.</p> \n<p>It helps to reference your market research documentation here, like a Porter’s Five Forces Analysis or a SWOT Analysis (<a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/market-research-kit\">templates for those are available here</a>). You can also include them in your appendix.</p> \n<p>If your company already has buyer personas, you should include them here as well. If not, you can make them right now using the <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/make-my-persona\">Make My Persona Tool</a>.</p> \n<h3>5. Marketing Plan</h3> \n<p>Unlike the market analysis section, your marketing plan section should be an explanation of the tactical approach to reaching your aforementioned target audience. List the channels you’ll be advertising on, what organic marketing methods you’ll employ, etc.</p> \n<p>If your company has a fully fleshed out marketing plan, you can attach it in the appendix of your business plan. If not, <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/marketing-plan-template\">download this free marketing plan template</a> to outline your strategy.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h3>6. Sales Plan</h3> \n<p>It doesn’t matter if your sales department is an office full of BDRs or a dozen stores with your products on their shelves. The point is – like all companies – all sales strategies are different, so you should clearly outline yours here. Common talking points include:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Sales team structure, and why this structure was chosen.</li> \n <li>Sales channels.</li> \n <li>Sales tools, software, and resources.</li> \n <li>Prospecting strategy.</li> \n <li>Sales goals and budget.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Like with your marketing plan, it might make sense to attach your completed sales plan to the appendix of your business plan. You can <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/sales-plan-template\">download a template for building your sales plan here</a>.</p> \n<h3>7. Legal Notes</h3> \n<p>Your investors may want to know the legal structure of your business, since that could directly impact the risk of their investments. For example, if you’re looking for business partners to engage in a non-corporation or LLC partnership, this means they could be on the line for more than their actual investment. Because this clarification is often needed, explain if you are and/or plan to become a sole proprietor, partnership, corporation, LLC, etc.</p> \n<p>You should also outline the steps you have taken or will need to take in order to operate legally. This includes necessary licenses, permits, registrations, insurance requirements, etc. that are needed to follow the law. The last thing your investor wants to hear after they’ve sent you a big chunk of change is that you’re operating without proper approval from local, state, or federal government.</p> \n<h3>8. Financial Considerations</h3> \n<p>Ultimately, investors want to know two things:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>When they will earn their money back.</li> \n <li>When they will start seeing <em>returns</em> on their initial investment.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>That said, you’ll need to be clear, calculated, and convincing in this section. It should cover:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Startup costs.</li> \n <li>Sales forecasts for the next several months/quarters.</li> \n <li>Break-even analysis for time <em>and</em> dollars.</li> \n <li>Projected P&amp;L statement.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Most importantly, you’ll want to explain the <em>why</em> behind each of these sections. Facts and figures are key here, so be as specific as possible with each line item and projection, in addition to <em>why</em> you’ve included it.</p> \n<p>If you have pages upon pages of charts and spreadsheets for this section (which – arguably – you should), you may want to distill them into a page or two and include the rest of the sheets in the appendix.</p> \n<h3>9. Appendix</h3> \n<p>The best business plans are filled with imperative information, spanning dozens or even hundreds of pages long. To avoid disrupting the flow of the business plan with visuals, charts, and spreadsheets, consider including all of these resources in the appendix. Aside from what we’ve already mentioned – marketing plan, sales plan, department budgets, financial documents, etc. – you may also want to attach the following in the appendix:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Floor plans for your location.</li> \n <li>Images of social media pages.</li> \n <li>Your logo and any graphic design assets.</li> \n <li>Mock-ups of your product.</li> \n <li>Renderings of your office space or location design.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Adding these pieces to the appendix enriches the reader’s understanding of your business and proves you’ve put the work into your business plan without distracting from the points throughout the plan.</p> \n<h2><strong>Use a Business Plan Template to Get Started</strong></h2> \n<p>Writing a business plan shouldn’t be an insurmountable roadblock to starting a business. Unfortunately, for all too many, it is.</p> \n<p>That’s why we recommend using our <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/business-plan-template?hubs_post-cta=body\">free business plan template</a><strong>. </strong>Pre-filled with detailed section prompts for all of the topics in this blog post, we’re confident this template will get your business plan started in the right direction.</p> \n<p><em>Editor's note: This post was originally published in June, 2017 and has been updated for comprehensiveness.</em></p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fbusiness-plan-template&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 07 Aug 2020 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":924,"bgimg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/business-plan-2.jpg#keepProtocol","linkMd5":"9a3dca76c24ad4ee342cb3326466ecd1","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn28@2020_1/2020/08/16/13-48-27-572_fce165d05ba01362.webp","metaImg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/business-plan-2.jpg#keepProtocol","author":"AJ Beltis","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/One-Page%20Business%20Plan%20Template.jpg?width=1500&name=One-Page%20Business%20Plan%20Template.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn99@2020_1/2020/08/16/13-48-31-942_316daa92eb250477.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/bpt-cover-gif.gif?width=409&name=bpt-cover-gif.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn28@2020_4/2020/08/16/13-48-36-675_a84d5b3d5c9e6b05.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fbusiness-plan-template&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn92@2020_1/2020/08/16/13-48-35-181_3b0fda08f214b8e0.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 21:48:25","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 21:48:25","title":"11 of the Best Professional Bio Examples We've Ever Seen [+ Bio Templates]","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/professional-bio-examples","description":"<p>Is your professional bio as good as it can be?</p>   \n<p>In this article, we have nine real bio examples you should definitely compare yours to — and a series of free bio templates you can use to perfect it.</p> \n<p>Most people don't think about their professional bio until they're suddenly asked to \"shoot one over via email,\" and have approximately one afternoon to come up with it. That's when we scramble, and our bio ends up reading like this:</p> \n<em>Rodney Erickson is a content marketing professional at HubSpot, an inbound marketing and sales platform that helps companies attract visitors, convert leads, and close customers. Previously, Rodney worked as a marketing manager for a tech software startup. He graduated with honors from Columbia University with a dual degree in Business Administration and Creative Writing.\"</em>\n<br> \n<p>Woof, that was dull. Are you still with me? I swear, not even adding a tidbit about his cats would liven that bio up.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>To be fair, in certain contexts, your professional bio does need to be more formal, like Mr. Erickson's up there. But in many cases, writing a bio that's readable — even conversational — is actually a really good thing.

Instagram, for example, allows only <a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/insights/social-media-character-counter/\">150 characters</a> of bio space, whereas you can write virtually as much as you want on your personal website — or even your Facebook Business page. But once created, this bio should represent who you are in the eyes of your audience.</p> \n   </div> \n  </div> \n </div> \n <div style=\"text-align: left;\"> \n  <div> \n   <h3>2. Begin writing your bio with your first and last name.</h3> \n  </div> \n  <div> \n   <div> \n    <p>If your readers don't remember anything else about your bio, make sure they remember your name. For that reason, it's a good idea for your first and last name to be the first two words of your professional bio. Even if your name is printed above this bio (hint: it should), this is a rare moment where it's okay to be redundant.</p> \n    <p>For example, if I were writing my own bio, I might start it like this:</p> \n    <h4><em>Lindsay Kolowich</em></h4> \n    <p><em>Lindsay Kolowich is a Senior Marketing Manager at HubSpot.</em></p> \n   </div> \n  </div> \n </div> \n <div style=\"text-align: left;\"> \n  <div> \n   <h3>3. Mention any associated brand name you might use.</h3> \n  </div> \n  <div> \n   <div> \n    <p>Will your professional bio represent yourself, or a business you work for? Make sure the brand you want to be associated with is mentioned in your bio. If you're a freelancer, perhaps you have a personal business name or pseudonym you advertise to your clients. Here are a few examples:</p> \n    <ul> \n     <li>Lindsay Kolowich Marketing</li> \n     <li>SEO Lindsay</li> \n     <li>Kolowich Consulting</li> \n     <li>Content by Kolowich (what do you think ... too cheesy?)</li> \n    </ul> \n    <p>Maybe you founded your own company, and you want its name to be separate from your real name. Don't be afraid to keep it simple: <em>\"Lindsay Kolowich is the founder and CEO of Kolowich Consulting.\"</em></p> \n   </div> \n  </div> \n </div> \n <div style=\"text-align: left;\"> \n  <div> \n   <h3>4. State your current position and what you do.</h3> \n  </div> \n  <div> \n   <div> \n    <p>Whether you're the founder of your company or a mid-level specialist, use the next few lines of your bio to describe what you do in that position. Don't assume your audience will naturally know what your job title entails. Make your primary responsibilities known for the reader, helping them paint a picture of who you are during the day and what you have to offer the industry.</p> \n   </div> \n  </div> \n </div> \n <div style=\"text-align: left;\"> \n  <div> \n   <h3>5. Include at least one professional accomplishment.</h3> \n  </div> \n  <div> \n   <div> \n    <p>Just as a business touts its client successes in the form of case studies, your professional bio should let your own audience know what you've already achieved. What have you done for yourself — as well as for others — that makes you a valuable player in your industry?</p> \n   </div> \n  </div> \n </div> \n <div style=\"text-align: left;\"> \n  <div> \n   <h3>6. Describe your values and how they inform your career.</h3> \n  </div> \n  <div> \n   <div> \n    <p><em>Why</em> do you do what you do? What might make your contribution to the market different than your colleagues? Better yet, what values do you and your colleagues share that would make your business a worthwhile investment to others? Start to wrap up your professional bio by simply explaining what gets you up in the morning.</p> \n   </div> \n  </div> \n </div> \n <div style=\"text-align: left;\"> \n  <div> \n   <h3>7. Briefly tell your readers who you are outside of work.</h3> \n  </div> \n  <div> \n   <div> \n    <p>Transition from describing your values in work to describing who you are <em>outside</em> of work. This may include:</p> \n    <ul> \n     <li>Your family</li> \n     <li>Your hometown</li> \n     <li>Sports you play</li> \n     <li>Hobbies and interests</li> \n     <li>Favorite music and travel destinations</li> \n     <li>Side hustles you're working on</li> \n    </ul> \n    <p>People like connecting with other people. The more transparent you are about who you are personally, the more likable you'll be to the people reading about who you are professionally.</p> \n   </div> \n  </div> \n </div> \n <div style=\"text-align: left;\"> \n  <div> \n   <h3>8. Consider adding humor or a personal story to add flavor to your professional bio.</h3> \n  </div> \n  <div> \n   <div> \n    <p>End your professional bio on a good note — or, more specifically, a funny note. Leaving your audience with something quirky or uniquely you can ensure they'll leave your website with a pleasant impression of you.</p> \n    <p>It's important to follow the steps above when writing your bio, but don't obsess over any one section. Remember, the people reading your bio are suffering from information fatigue. If you don't hook 'em in the first line, you'll lose them quickly.</p> \n   </div> \n  </div> \n </div> \n</div> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>(P.S.

It's just a bio.</em> I mean, how many people actually read professional bios, anyway?</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The answer: A lot of people. More importantly, though, there's no way to tell exactly <em>who</em> is reading it — and you always want it to be ready for when the <em>right</em> people come across it. And when they do, you want it to catch their eye. In a good way.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">You see, while <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-write-a-standout-resume\">your resume</a> is only useful for when you're actively applying for specific positions, your professional bio is much more visible. It can live on <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/linkedin-profile-perfection-cheat-sheet\">your LinkedIn profile</a>, your company's website, your guest blog posts, your speaker profiles, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/insiders/how-to-write-a-twitter-bio\">your Twitter bio</a>, and many other places.</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>And, most importantly, it's the tool that you can leverage most when you're networking.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Bottom line? People <em>will</em> read your professional bio. Whether they remember it, and whether it makes them actually care about you, is a matter of how well you present yourself to your intended audience.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">So, what does a top-notch professional bio look like?</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Below, we've curated some of the best real professional bio examples we've ever seen on Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, and the various websites where you might describe yourself.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Check 'em out, and use them as inspiration when crafting your own.</p> \n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>11 of the Best Professional Bio Examples We've Ever Seen</strong></h2> \n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">1. <a href=\"http://www.annhandley.com/\" style=\"font-size: 1.5rem;\">Ann Handley</a></h3> \n<h4 style=\"text-align: left;\">Bio Platform: Personal Website</h4> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">If you're a marketer, you've likely heard of Ann Handley. Her list of credentials is lengthy, and if she really wanted to, she could go on and on and on about her accomplishments.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">But when people list out all their accomplishments in their bios, they risk sounding a little egotistical. Sure, you might impress a handful of people with all those laurels, but many people who read your bio will end up feeling either intimidated or annoyed. Think about it: Is that how you want the majority of your readers to feel when they read your bio?</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">To minimize the egoism that comes with talking about yourself, think about how you can list out your accomplishments without sounding like you're bragging. Ann does this really well, choosing a tone in her bio that's more approachable.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">It starts with the excerpt in the footer of her personal website. Give it a quick read, paying close attention to the opening and closing lines:</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/ann-handley-website-bio.png?width=640&amp;name=ann-handley-website-bio.png\" alt=\"Ann Handley's professional bio on her personal website\" width=\"640\" style=\"width: 640px;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\"This is Ann Handley's website, and this is a bit of copy about her ... That's not giving you a lot of detail, is it? So read more here.\" This is the kind of simple, friendly language that invites the reader in rather than shutting them out.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Follow the link and you'll be led to a page dedicated to a fuller bio, which she's divided into two parts: a \"short version\" (literally a bulleted list of key facts) and a \"long version,\" which includes traditional paragraphs. There's something in there for everyone.</p> \n<h3>2. <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/miss604/\">Rebecca Bollwitt</a></h3> \n<h4>Bio platform: Instagram</h4> \n<p>Instagram is a notoriously difficult platform on which to write a good bio. Similar to Twitter, you simply don't have room for a professional bio that includes <em>everything</em> about you. And because Instagram is primarily a mobile app, many viewers are reading about you passively on their mobile device.</p> \n<p>Instagram's limited bio space requires you to highlight just your most important qualities, and blogging icon Rebecca Bollwitt does so in her own Instagram bio in an excellent way.</p> \n<p>Rebecca's brand name is Miss604, and cleverly uses emojis in her Instagram bio to tell visitors exactly what makes her a valuable content creator. Take a look in the screenshot below.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/miss604.png?width=1518&amp;name=miss604.png\" alt=\"miss604 professional bio on Instagram\" width=\"1518\" style=\"width: 1518px;\"></p> \n<p>Starting with a trophy emoji, Miss604 says she's BC's most award-winning blogger. I haven't even looked at her pictures yet and the introduction of her bio has already sucked me in.</p> \n<p>The rest of her bio follows suit, breaking up the text with an appropriate emoji and a perfect collection of nouns to tell me who she is as a person. She even links out to her husband's Instagram account after the heart emoji (an adorable addition), and assures her followers that all of her pictures are authentically hers.</p> \n<p>Take a lesson from Miss604, and show your personal side. Just because you're branding yourself as a professional doesn't mean you have to take your <em>human being</em> hat off. Often your most personal attributes make for the best professional bio content.</p> \n<h3>3. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/m_gallion\">Mark Gallion</a></h3> \n<h4>Bio Platform: Twitter</h4> \n<p>As a venture capitalist and an executive at several start-ups, Mark Gallion has different versions of his bio all over the internet. You can imagine some are more formal than others. But when it comes to his Twitter bio, he carefully phrased his information in a way that helps him connect with his audience — specifically, through the use of humor.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/mark-gallion.png?width=1082&amp;name=mark-gallion.png\" alt=\"mark gallion professional bio on twitter\" width=\"1082\" style=\"width: 1082px;\"></p> \n<p>Why would he choose humor when he runs four start-ups and constantly seeks funding for them? Well, Mark's tactic is totally intentional: it's a lever he pulls to refresh his brand while maintaining his already impressive and established identity as an entrepreneur.</p> \n<p>Mark leverages his Twitter bio because it’s place where he can be human. And it helps him relate to his followers and potential investors.</p> \n<p>When crafting your own Twitter bio, consider your audience and the personal brand you're trying to create for yourself. Use it as an opportunity to be relatable. (And check out this <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/twitter-bio\">list of amusing Twitter bios for inspiration</a>.)</p> \n<h3>4. <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pg/DJNexus4/about/\">DJ Nexus</a></h3> \n<h4>Bio Platform: Facebook</h4> \n<p>This New England-based DJ has single-handedly captured the Likes of more than 2,000 people in and beyond Boston, MA. And even if you don't listen to the type of music he produces, it's hard not to listen to his compelling Facebook bio.</p> \n<p>Stage-named DJ Nexus, Jamerson's professional bio makes use of nearly every Page field inside the About tab. Right away, his audience knows which genres he plays in, where he's from, and who else he's worked with. The latter — under \"Affiliation,\" as shown in the screenshot below — is unique and seldom mentioned in professional bios today.</p> \n<p>Our favorite part about DJ Nexus's bio? His tagline, under \"About\" — \"<strong>Quiet during the day. QUITE LOUD at night!</strong>\" DJ Nexus tells you <em>when</em> he works in an awesome way. I got goosebumps just imagining a dance club he might play his music in.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/dj-nexus-professional-bio.png?width=575&amp;height=439&amp;name=dj-nexus-professional-bio.png\" alt=\"DJ Nexus's professional bio on Facebook\" width=\"575\" height=\"439\" style=\"width: 575px;\"></p> \n<p>DJ Nexus's bio brilliance doesn't stop there.</p> \n<p>The great thing about Facebook Business Pages is that you can write as much as you want without <i>overwhelming your Page visitors</i>. For those who just want Jamerson's basic info, they have the four categories shown above. For those who want to learn more about him, he tells an excellent story of his career. Here's just a preview of his story, below:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/dj%20nexus%20professional%20bio%20story.png?width=385&amp;height=376&amp;name=dj%20nexus%20professional%20bio%20story.png\" alt=\"A story on DJ Nexus's Facebook Business Page\" width=\"385\" height=\"376\" style=\"width: 385px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<p>In this story, DJ Nexus describes both when he \"became known as DJ Nexus\" and a company he founded shortly afterward — all before going to college. This is a terrific lesson for Facebook Businesses today: customers want to learn about you, and as Facebook increasingly becomes a place for meaningful interactions, there's no better place to tell your story than on your Facebook Business Page.</p> \n<h3>5. <a href=\"https://therapists.psychologytoday.com/rms/name/Lena_Axelsson_PsyD,LMFT_Santa+Cruz_California_89644\">Lena Axelsson</a></h3> \n<h4>Bio Platform: Industry Website</h4> \n<p>When it all comes down to it, your professional bio is no different than any other piece of persuasive copy — no matter where it lives. One of the most common mistakes people make is thinking of it as its own beast, separate from other pieces of writing. If you think about it that way, you're far more likely to write something painfully uninteresting.</p> \n<p>When you sit down to write your professional bio and you're watching that cursor blinking on the screen, think about how you would introduce a blog post. You don't just dive right into the meat of the thing, now, do you? No. You start with an introduction.</p> \n<p>The best bios are often concise (around 200–300 words), so you don't have a lot of room to play around. But a single sentence that tees your reader up and provides context for the accomplishments that follow could make the rest of your bio that much more persuasive.</p> \n<p>Take Lena Axelsson's bio, for instance. She's a marriage and family therapist — a job where empathy and compassion are a big part of the job description. That's why she chooses to open her bio with a great introductory sentence: \"When human beings experience trauma or severe life stressors, it is not uncommon for their lives to unravel.\"</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/therapist-bio-example.png?width=640&amp;name=therapist-bio-example.png\" alt=\"Lena Axelsson's professional bio on an industry website for therapists\" width=\"640\" style=\"width: 640px;\"></p> \n<p>Then, she goes into why she's passionate about her job, how she helps her clients, and how she caters her approach to each individual patient. The necessary educational information is left for the end, after the reader has been hooked.</p> \n<p>Your bio doesn't have to be super serious, nor does it have to start with a joke. This bio shows how you can capture your reader's attention by being empathetic and showing how that empathy shapes a valuable professional.</p> \n<h3>6. <a href=\"http://www.levyinnovation.com/about/\">Mark Levy</a></h3> \n<h4>Bio Platform: Personal Website</h4> \n<p>Mark Levy is a small business owner who's taken a more traditional approach to the professional bio on his website — but in a way that takes care to speak to his intended audience.</p> \n<p>What we love about his bio is the way he's set it up: On his business' \"About\" page, he's listed two biographies, which he's labeled \"Mark Levy's Biography #1\" and \"Mark Levy's Biography #2.\"</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/mark-levy-professional-bio.png?width=640&amp;name=mark-levy-professional-bio.png\" alt=\"Mark Levy's professional bio in his personal website\" width=\"640\" style=\"width: 640px;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.levyinnovation.com/about/\">Click here to see the full version</a>.</p> \n<p>Like Ann, Mark's given his readers two different options. The first biography is a \"short version,\" which includes a combination of bullet points listing his credentials and a few short paragraphs.</p> \n<p>The second is the \"long version,\" which is actually even more interesting than the first one. Why? Because it reads like a story — a compelling one, at that. In fact, it gets really funny at parts.</p> \n<p>The second sentence of the bio reads: \"He was frightened of public school, loved playing baseball and football, ran home to watch ape films on the 4:30 Movie, listened to The Jam and The Buzzcocks, and read magic trick books.\"</p> \n<p>Here's another excerpt from the middle:</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/mark-levy-long-bio-snippet.png?width=640&amp;name=mark-levy-long-bio-snippet.png\" alt=\"A snippet from Mark Levy's full professional bio on his personal website\" width=\"640\" style=\"width: 640px;\"></p> \n<p>Of course, the fantastic copywriting isn't a surprise, given that this guy wrote several books. But the conversational tone and entertaining copy let his quirky personality (and great writing skills) shine.</p> \n<h3>7. <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/author/corey-wainwright\">Corey Wainwright</a></h3> \n<h4>Bio Platform: Blog Byline</h4> \n<p>Corey Wainwright is the director of content here at HubSpot. She's written content for HubSpot's Marketing Blog for years, and her blog author bio has caught my eye since before I ever started working for HubSpot. (Back then, it started with, \"Corey just took a cool vacation.\")</p> \n<p>What I love most about Corey's bio is that it's a great example of how to deliver information about yourself without taking things too seriously. And in this context, that's totally appropriate.</p> \n<p>Despite having a number of impressive accomplishments under her belt, she simply doesn't like displaying them publicly. So, she prefers making her author bio a little more \"light.\"</p> \n<p>Her bio (pictured below) reads, \"Corey is a Bruce Springsteen fan who does content marketing, in that order.\"</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/corey-wainwright-bio.png?width=640&amp;name=corey-wainwright-bio.png\" alt=\"Corey Wrainwright's professional bio as a blog byline for HubSpot\" width=\"640\" style=\"width: 640px;\"></p> \n<p>It works in this particular context because, at HubSpot, our blog authors often prefer to make themselves as friendly and approachable as possible — while letting the content speak for itself.</p> \n<p>It helps that authors' social media accounts are located right below our names and above our pictures. For folks who really do want a list of Corey's credentials, they can click the LinkedIn button to go to her LinkedIn page. (You can <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/29544/The-Ultimate-Cheat-Sheet-for-Creating-Social-Media-Buttons.aspx\">read this blog post to learn how to create social media buttons</a> and add them to your website.)</p> \n<h3>8. <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/marie-mikhail-12283b39/\">Marie Mikhail</a></h3> \n<h4>Bio Platform: LinkedIn</h4> \n<p>Marie Mikhail checks off nearly every box for what makes an excellent bio. A professional recruiter, she expresses her \"passion for recruiting\" upfront, in the first sentence, while using that sentence to hook her profile visitors into a brief story of her background.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/marie-mikhail-bio.png?width=1186&amp;name=marie-mikhail-bio.png\" alt=\"Marie Mikhail's professional bio on LinkedIn\" width=\"1186\" style=\"width: 1186px;\"></p> \n<p>But there are a lot of recruiters out there, and Marie knows that. So, to differentiate herself, she closes the first paragraph of her bio explaining that she likes \"getting people excited about the things [she's] excited about.\" It's a well-put value proposition that sets her apart from the rest of the HR industry.</p> \n<p>Marie Mikhail finishes off her bio by including a smooth mixture of professional skills, such as her Spanish fluency; and personal interests, such as podcasting and Star Wars (she mentions the latter with just the right amount of humor).</p> \n<h3>9. <a href=\"http://www.wonbowoo.com/about.html\">Wonbo Woo</a></h3> \n<h4>Bio Platform: Personal Website</h4> \n<p>Wonbo Woo is the executive producer of WIRED's video content, and he has a number of impressive credits to his name. What does this mean for his professional bio? He has to prioritize. With this in mind, Wonbo opens his bio with the most eye-catching details first (if the image below is hard to read, click it to see the full copy).</p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.wonbowoo.com/about.html\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/wonbo-woo-professional-bio-example.jpg?width=690&amp;name=wonbo-woo-professional-bio-example.jpg\" alt=\"Wonbo Woo's professional bio on his personal website\" width=\"690\"></a></p> \n<p>Not only does Wonbo's bio start strong, but he also takes readers on a suspenseful journey through some of his most harrowing assignments — where he was when news broke and how he responded. You can see this quality below.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/wonbo-woo-professional-bio-2.jpg?width=690&amp;name=wonbo-woo-professional-bio-2.jpg\" alt=\"snippet from Wonbo Woo's bio on his personal website\" width=\"690\" style=\"width: 690px;\">The accomplished journalist concludes his gripping bio as strong as it began, measuring his experience by the number of states, countries, and continents to which he's traveled in his career. See how this looks above. All in all, it's a fantastically concise bio for as much detail as it holds.</p> \n<h3 style=\"font-weight: normal;\">10. <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrisburkard\">Chris Burkard </a></h3> \n<h4>Bio Platform: LinkedIn</h4> \n<p>If you're writing your bio but having trouble figuring out how to showcase your accomplishments without boasting, photographer Burkard's LinkedIn bio is a great example for inspiration.</p> \n<p>Written in third-person, his bio tells a fluid story, starting with his ultimate mission — \"capture stories that inspire humans to consider their relationship with nature\" — before diving into more tangible accolades (giving a TED talk, publishing books, etc.).</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/chris-burkard-bio.png?width=1260&amp;name=chris-burkard-bio.png\" alt=\"Chris Burkard's professional bio on LinkedIn\" width=\"1260\" style=\"width: 1260px;\"></p> \n<p>Best of all, rather than using his bio as an opportunity to brag, he instead ties his talents into how he hopes to help <i>others</i>, writing, \"Through social media Chris strives to share his vision … and inspire [his followers] to explore for themselves.\" I wouldn't necessarily be inclined to follow Chris if his bio had simply read \"I post beautiful images\" … but inspire me to travel? Now that's something I can get behind.</p> \n<p>Lastly, he ends on a humble, sweet note, writing \"He is happiest wth his wife Breanne raising their two sons\". Don't be afraid to inject some personal information into your bio — it could help you seem more approachable as a result.</p> \n<h3 style=\"font-weight: normal;\">11. <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/detoxinista/\">Megan Gilmore</a></h3> \n<h4><strong>Bio Platform: Instagram</strong></h4> \n<p>Megan Gilmore is a best-selling cookbook author, and she often posts healthy recipes on her Instagram page to inspire followers' to realize that you don't have to sacrifice taste for the sake of health.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/megan-gilmore-bio.png?width=1524&amp;name=megan-gilmore-bio.png\" alt=\"Megan Gilmore's professional bio on Instagram\" width=\"1524\" style=\"width: 1524px;\"></p> \n<p>Fortunately, you glean most of this information immediately from her Instagram bio, which is short and to-the-point: \"Best-selling cookbook author + former fast-food junkie + mom of 2. I like to make healthy food as easy as possible.\" Her \"former fast-food junkie\" call-out shows followers she's relatable (and that her recipes are likely delicious yet healthy alternatives), and by mentioning she's a mother, you get the sense that her recipes really <i>will </i>actually be quick and easy.</p> \n<p>Plus, Gilmore includes a CTA link within her Instagram bio that leads followers to free, ready-to-use recipes. You might be thinking — <i>Why would she do that, since it discourages people from buying her book? </i>But that couldn't be further from the truth.</p> \n<p>By giving her followers the chance to try out her recipes, she's slowly turning leads into customers. After I tried a few of her Instagram recipes and loved them, I decided to go ahead and buy her book, knowing I'd like more of what she had to offer.</p> \n<p>Want more?

style=\"text-align: left;\">When it comes to turning web visitors into leads, <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics?_ga=2.39122723.1096999129.1559048254-1894039831.1558108101\">68% of B2B CEO’s use strategic landing pages</a> as part of their strategy.</p>  \n<p>A strong <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/7177/what-is-a-landing-page-and-why-should-you-care.aspx?_ga=2.211244565.1096999129.1559048254-1894039831.1558108101\">landing page</a> usually offers your website’s visitors a resource, such as a piece of content, in exchange for contact information. Sharing or hyperlinking to the URL of a landing page, rather than a homepage, also <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/7177/what-is-a-landing-page-and-why-should-you-care.aspx&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1558711791967000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGgiGh6Xv6RAe0-QJMjG9_49crS1w\">increases the likelihood of turning traffic into conversions</a>.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Landing%20Page%20Template%201.jpg?width=1500&amp;name=Landing%20Page%20Template%201.jpg\" alt=\"free website Landing Page Template\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>While landing pages can play a vital role in lead generation, they don’t have to be complicated. In fact, you should aim for a page that’s concise and inviting, rather than complex and overwhelming.</p> \n<p>Rather than just placing a rigorous contact form on a page, it can be more productive to tease an interesting offer or a free resource in exchange for only a small amount of information.</p> \n<p>Even when you know what you’re going to offer and what information you’d like to receive from a visitor, the idea of building a landing page can still feel daunting.</p> \n<p>If you don’t have the bandwidth to build a page yourself, have little experience in design software, or have limited resources to hire a designer, using a pre-designed template could be the most efficient way to launch a professional looking page in a short amount of time.</p> \n<p>We’ve put together a list of 15 free, easy-to-use templates that can guide you through the process of building your next landing page.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h2>15 Free Professionally-Designed Landing Page Templates</h2> \n<h3>1. Royce</h3> \n<p><em>Available on Squarespace</em></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://royce-demo.squarespace.com/\">Royce</a> is specialized for event reservations. There is no navigation bar, but the layout features a customizable background image, a headline, and a call-to-action button that says “RSVP.”</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Royce%20Event%20Landing%20Page.png?width=598&amp;name=Royce%20Event%20Landing%20Page.png\" alt=\"Royce Event Landing Page\" width=\"598\" style=\"width: 598px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<p>To fill out the form and reserve a spot, visitors can click the RSVP button to see a form appear, or scroll down below the fold to see a static reservation form. This is an interesting template because it amplifies visuals and keeps the layout simple while still offering visitors two ways to convert.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Royce%20RSVP%20Form.jpg?width=598&amp;name=Royce%20RSVP%20Form.jpg\" alt=\"Royce RSVP Submission Form on Royce Landing Page\" width=\"598\" style=\"width: 598px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<h3>2. Invest</h3> \n<p><em>Available on HubSpot</em></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://marketplace.hubspot.com/products/inboundpixels/invest?_ga=2.158278450.966289747.1558623644-1894039831.1558108101\">This</a><a href=\"https://marketplace.hubspot.com/products/inboundpixels/invest?_ga=2.12917559.1096999129.1559048254-1894039831.1558108101\"> design</a> includes a photo, customizable text, no navigation (to keep visitors focused on your offer), and a short form. Users can also customize and add other elements such as the icons seen at the bottom of the image. Below the fold, users can also add more information about the offer or company.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/15%20Free%20Professionally-Designed%20Landing%20Page%20Templates-1.png\" alt=\"Invest Landing Page Template from Hubspot\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n</div> \n<h3>3. Hubstrap</h3> \n<p><em>Available on HubSpot</em></p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://marketplace.hubspot.com/products/hubstrap-pro/hubstrap-lite-landing?_ga=2.235884929.1096999129.1559048254-1894039831.1558108101\">Hubstrap</a> template has a simplistic look and feel but devotes a bit more room to text. This might be a good option if your content offer has less imagery to go with it. For example, you might use this page to describe an offer or a long whitepaper on a topic related to your industry. Users can similarly personalize the design and add drag-and-drop sections to the page.</p> \n<p>Unlike the above landing pages, this example does include navigation. However, it’s simple enough that it doesn't detract from the offer.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Hubstrap%20Landing%20Page.jpg?width=485&amp;name=Hubstrap%20Landing%20Page.jpg\" alt=\"Hubstrap Landing Page\" width=\"485\" style=\"width: 485px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<h3>4. Landing Form</h3> \n<p><em>Available on HubSpot</em></p> \n<p>This <a href=\"https://marketplace.hubspot.com/products/inboundpixels/landing-form?_ga=2.235884929.1096999129.1559048254-1894039831.1558108101\">template</a> includes a background image with a dark overlay, a headline, text, bright call-to-action buttons, and a form. It eliminates the navigation bar but includes a button at the top of the page. The image also has a dark overlay to keep it visible, but less distracting. As you scroll below the fold, this template also includes spots for more imagery and details that could relate to the product or offer.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/15%20Free%20Professionally-Designed%20Landing%20Page%20Templates.png\" alt=\"Landing Form Landing Page Template from Hubspot\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n</div> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>5. Gradient</h3> \n<p><em>Available on HubSpot</em></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://marketplace.hubspot.com/products/inboundpixels/gradient-landing-left?_ga=2.235884929.1096999129.1559048254-1894039831.1558108101\">Gradient</a> is sleekly designed for a content-based offer. It has a simple layout with a form, headline, description text, photo, and logo, but continues the theme of no navigation. Like the other HubSpot templates, users can add a photo or product shot, a background image that appears behind a gradient color, and descriptive text. They can also adjust or change the gradient background’s color.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/15%20Free%20Professionally-Designed%20Landing%20Page%20Templates-5.png\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" alt=\"Gradient Landing Page Template from Hubspot\">\n</div> \n<h3>6.

The form is more detailed, but the layout itself also allows room for more text and imagery. Above the fold, you can see a headline, supporting images, and a form. If you keep scrolling, there are additional sections where more text and imagery can be placed.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/15%20Free%20Professionally-Designed%20Landing%20Page%20Templates-10.png?width=598&amp;name=15%20Free%20Professionally-Designed%20Landing%20Page%20Templates-10.png\" alt=\"University Landing Page Template from Wix\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 598px;\" width=\"598\">\n</div> \n<h3>7. Skyline</h3> \n<p><em>Available on Wix</em></p> \n<p>This <a href=\"https://www.wix.com/website-template/view/html/1896?siteId=c54249f0-9878-4464-9dc0-5cc938a097e4&amp;metaSiteId=2f5a38ee-e1bf-4a2d-a169-8e9670dd4cb0&amp;originUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wix.com%2Fwebsite%2Ftemplates%2Fhtml%2Flanding-pages\">template</a> may be helpful to a company or individual that hasn’t yet launched a website or product but still wants to gain early leads in the meantime. Above the fold, there’s a giant headline area, where the template has “Coming Soon” printed.</p> \n<p>When you scroll down, you can see a quick description of the company and a box where visitors can add their email. Users can also add a photo or video to the background.</p> \n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/15%20Free%20Professionally-Designed%20Landing%20Page%20Templates-7.png?width=598&amp;name=15%20Free%20Professionally-Designed%20Landing%20Page%20Templates-7.png\" alt=\"Skyline Landing Page Template from Wix\" width=\"598\" style=\"width: 598px; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/15%20Free%20Professionally-Designed%20Landing%20Page%20Templates-6.png?width=598&amp;name=15%20Free%20Professionally-Designed%20Landing%20Page%20Templates-6.png\" alt=\"Under the fold of Skyline Landing Page from Wix\" width=\"598\" style=\"width: 598px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n</div> \n<h3>8. Online Store Coming Soon</h3> \n<p><em>Available on Wix</em></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.wix.com/website-template/view/html/1939?siteId=2eef1a7e-1c6a-4b0f-8966-9fe337214403&amp;metaSiteId=6eaab85a-12cd-445e-89b7-4529b6417db7&amp;originUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wix.com%2Fwebsite%2Ftemplates%2Fhtml%2Flanding-pages\">This template</a> is very simple. Like the above “Coming Soon” template, the text could be edited to use this layout for a different purpose. There is no navigation and any information about the company is off to the corners. This layout allows space for a clear product shot, as seen with the shoes. Headline text, a small amount of descriptive text, an email box, and a button are pre-designed in the layout. Users can also link their social media accounts to the icons under the “Notify Me” button.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/15%20Free%20Professionally-Designed%20Landing%20Page%20Templates-3.png?width=600&amp;name=15%20Free%20Professionally-Designed%20Landing%20Page%20Templates-3.png\" alt=\"Wix's &quot;Online Store Coming Soon&quot; Template.\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<h3>9.

It allows users to edit and customize the text and images through Wix. Users can also place background videos into the layout. The page is designed to be long, with the form and call-to-action above the fold followed by sections that detail different aspects of a company or firm, such as staff information.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/15%20Free%20Professionally-Designed%20Landing%20Page%20Templates-8.png?width=598&amp;name=15%20Free%20Professionally-Designed%20Landing%20Page%20Templates-8.png\" alt=\"Lead-Gen Landing Page from Wix\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 598px;\" width=\"598\">\n</div> \n<h3>10. Fagri</h3> \n<p><em>Available on WordPress.org</em></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/fagri/\">Fagri</a> was designed broadly for multiple purposes and industries. According to its description, the theme’s widgets, such as the contact form are customizable. Users can also change the text and images. Although there is a navigation bar, the layout’s design still draws attention to the text, call-to-action buttons, and the contact form.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Fagri%20landing%20page%20from%20Wordpress.jpg?width=598&amp;name=Fagri%20landing%20page%20from%20Wordpress.jpg\" alt=\"Fagri landing page from Wordpress\" width=\"598\" style=\"width: 598px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<h3>11. Real Estate Landing Page</h3> \n<p><em>Available on Wix</em></p> \n<p>Although <a href=\"https://www.wix.com/website-template/view/html/1884?siteId=95b005c4-79e5-4c37-89f6-7011ea2fa6d9&amp;metaSiteId=20ff8dd7-a2cd-4318-8ce7-800826bb5282&amp;originUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wix.com%2Fwebsite%2Ftemplates%2Fhtml%2Flanding-pages\">this template</a> doesn’t offer a resource for information, it can be edited and customized to include an offer. As you scroll down the page, the background image can remain static. With the current page’s design, there is room to add company information below the fold. There is also a second form at the very bottom so visitors will have another chance to convert.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Real%20Estate%20Landing%20Page.jpg?width=598&amp;name=Real%20Estate%20Landing%20Page.jpg\" alt=\"Real Estate Landing Page\" width=\"598\" style=\"width: 598px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<h3>12. Construction and Lawyer Landing Pages</h3> \n<p><em>Both Available on WordPress.org</em></p> \n<p>Wordpress also offers two similar <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/lawyer-landing-page/\"><strong>Lawyer Landing Page</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/construction-landing-page/\"><strong>Construction Landing</strong> <strong>Page</strong></a> templates. Although the original designs are targeted at the two job fields, they can be customized to fit other brands and industries. Both have a header image, overlaid text, and an arrow pointing to a decently sized form above the fold. They also both offer the visitor a free quote.</p> \n<h3>13. Gardenhouse</h3> \n<p><em>Available on MailChimp</em></p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/15%20Free%20Professionally-Designed%20Landing%20Page%20Templates-2.png?width=600&amp;name=15%20Free%20Professionally-Designed%20Landing%20Page%20Templates-2.png\" alt=\"Gardenhouse Landing Page from MailChimp\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<p>This template does not include a navigation bar, which forces a visitor to focus on the given offer. Towards the bottom of the page, it can be customized to include logos or other company information. Like all MailChimp landing page themes, this layout is optimized for mobile and will automatically adjust to different screen sizes.</p> \n<h3>14. Bandmates</h3> \n<p><em>Available on MailChimp</em></p> \n<p>This template is also pretty simple with room for customization. It similarly removes navigation and keeps the company logo, text description, and a subscribe form above the fold.</p> \n<p>Users can also drag in more elements, like text or form boxes, into the design. Just below the form, users can include a product shot or another image. The blue background allows the form and call-to-action button to pop, but these colors can also be customized to fit your brand.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/15%20Free%20Professionally-Designed%20Landing%20Page%20Templates-9.png?width=598&amp;name=15%20Free%20Professionally-Designed%20Landing%20Page%20Templates-9.png\" alt=\"Bandmates Landing Page from Mailchimp\" width=\"598\" style=\"width: 598px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<h3>15. O-Book</h3> \n<p><em>Available on Unbounce</em></p> \n<p>Unbounce layouts come with its subscription, but <a href=\"https://unbounce.com/landing-page-template/o-book/\">here's one of the landing pages </a>that you can test out with a free 14-day trial. This template is focused on book-specific lead generation. There is a clear spot for a product image, headlines, detailed description text, and a form box.</p> \n<p>The top navigation is minimal, but it does include social media buttons. Since this layout is only free for a trial period, this might be a better option for a company that has already gained revenue from landing pages and is looking to test out a more detailed, but affordable design.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/15%20Free%20Professionally-Designed%20Landing%20Page%20Templates-4.png?width=598&amp;name=15%20Free%20Professionally-Designed%20Landing%20Page%20Templates-4.png\" alt=\"O-Book Landing Page from Unbounce\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 598px;\" width=\"598\">\n</div> \n<h3>Landing Page Best Practices</h3> \n<p>The above templates already follow a number of landing page best practices. For example, many of them exclude a navigation bar, which may detract attention or clicks away from the offer on the page. Most of them also leave room for a photo or video. While photos offer a great product tease, videos have also been seen to <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics\">increase conversions by 86%</a>.</p> \n<p>To learn about other landing-page best practices, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/landing-page-templates?_ga=2.37649824.1096999129.1559048254-1894039831.1558108101\">check out this guide</a>.</p>

Tool","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/digital-credentials","description":"<p>Marketing can have an enormous, positive impact on both revenue and brand recognition. Which is why organizations spend so much time, energy, and resources trying to reach their target audience.</p> \n<p>And yet, from billboard ads and radio slots to the roughly <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/456500/daily-number-of-e-mails-worldwide/\">300 billion</a> emails sent each day, it's hard to boost your brand amidst all the noise.</p> \n<p>Fortunately, there are innovative ways to cut through the crowded market and build brand awareness: and one of those opportunities is through <a href=\"https://resources.credly.com/what-is-a-dc-infographic\">digital credentials</a>.</p> \n<p>Digital credentials have emerged as an impactful marketing tool across a variety of industries including corporate training, associations, professional development and certifications, and higher education. If your organization issues digital credentials, there are several things you can do to make the most of their marketing power.</p> \n<p>Here, we'll cover four areas where incorporating digital badges can help your brand stand out.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h3>1. Social</h3> \n<p>With over <a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/contributors/2019/01/30/digital-trends-2019-every-single-stat-you-need-to-know-about-the-internet/\">3.4 billion</a> active users, there's no denying social media is a modern marketing powerhouse. If your brand doesn't already have a social strategy in place, you're potentially losing out on the opportunity to engage with <em>millions</em> of customers.</p> \n<p>Incorporating digital credentials into your social media strategy can drive brand awareness, increase engagement with the individuals who earn your badges, and strengthen the reputation of your company online.</p> \n<p>To incorporate digital credentials, try using keywords and hashtags to search for individuals sharing your digital credentials online and interact with them — give them a \"Like\", a re-tweet, or congratulate them on their achievement. You'll build stronger connections and create new engagement opportunities with your badge earners.</p> \n<p>For instance, anyone who's earned a HubSpot certification could post it on their LinkedIn, like the example below:</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20to%20Make%20Digital%20Credentials%20Your%20Most%20Impactful%20Marketing%20Tool.png?width=427&amp;name=How%20to%20Make%20Digital%20Credentials%20Your%20Most%20Impactful%20Marketing%20Tool.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 427px;\" width=\"427\">\n</div> \n<p>Connecting with these users over social media in a meaningful way provides an opportunity for every single one of them to become an evangelist for your brand.</p> \n<p>Another way to leverage digital credentials in this way is for employees to share their certifications socially. Think of this as employees promoting company news or recent awards. By sharing achievements on their social channels, your employees are promoting your brand among users you may not have had the chance to get in front of otherwise.</p> \n<h3>2. Email</h3> \n<p>We've already established there is an inordinate number of emails exchanged each day, which means the average person receives multiple emails every hour. Even so, email marketing is still one of the most important and effective ways for your business to connect with customers and build meaningful relationships.</p> \n<p>Since your team is sending emails to people outside your organization, putting digital credentials in employee email signatures drives brand awareness and validation from the moment an email is opened. When your employees' certifications are on display, they work alongside your company logo to reinforce your brand every time an email is sent, forwarded, or replied to.</p> \n<p>Likewise, encourage your external badge earners to add digital credentials to their professional email signatures, too. Credentials help them establish credibility from the moment they hit \"Send\", allows email recipients to instantly verify the digital badge, and helps them learn more about your products and organization in the process.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Hubspot%20Article_Email%20Example.png?width=381&amp;name=Hubspot%20Article_Email%20Example.png\" alt=\"Hubspot Article_Email Example\" width=\"381\" style=\"width: 381px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<h3>3. Online</h3> \n<p>As a marketer, driving quality traffic to your company's site is a core focus. It's the reason there's such importance placed on including backlinks to a website in emails, social media posts, and content.</p> \n<p>The beauty of digital credentials is they're meant to be seen and shared. Developing a dedicated landing page for your digital credentials where potential earners can see the badge associated with the skill is a great way to get visibility for your credentials and is a great place for new earners to start the trial or purchase process. The more people visiting the page, the more recognition you'll have for your initiative.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Hubspot%20Example_Online%20Landing%20Page.png?width=1172&amp;name=Hubspot%20Example_Online%20Landing%20Page.png\" alt=\"Hubspot Example_Online Landing Page\" width=\"1172\" style=\"width: 1172px;\"></p> \n<h3>4. Events</h3> \n<p>Events are a critical marketing initiative because they offer the opportunity to build relationships with key customers and prospects. In an increasingly digital world, many marketers believe face-to-face interactions at events are crucial to generating pipeline. In fact, <a href=\"https://www.marketingcharts.com/customer-centric/lead-generation-and-management-82291\">68% of B2B marketers</a> agree that live events help generate the most leads.</p> \n<p>Since events place a significant focus on generating brand awareness in a sea of industry solutions, you have to ensure your brand stays top-of-mind for attendees.</p> \n<p>Whether it's a job fair or conference, including digital badges at your booth is a great way to encourage conversation and spark questions about your organization's products and programs, as well as your commitment to employee development.</p> \n<p>The visual representation of competencies allows key audiences to see your expertise before they even engage with your team.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Hubspot%20Example_Event%20Flyer.png?width=541&amp;name=Hubspot%20Example_Event%20Flyer.png\" alt=\"Hubspot Example_Event Flyer\" width=\"541\" style=\"width: 541px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<p>Today, having a great product or service is only half the battle. Making sure people know about your organization and how to engage with it is a huge challenge, but also a huge part of brand success. Creating brand awareness won't happen overnight. Using these ideas can help carve out your place in the market and help your brand stand out in no time.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fdigital-credentials&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 11 Aug 2020 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":924,"bgimg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/digital-credentials.jpg#keepProtocol","linkMd5":"ce7b89a71f8f29571df96c8ba23cf23a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn39@2020_5/2020/08/16/13-48-27-404_a460cba66ceb7f1e.webp","metaImg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/digital-credentials.jpg#keepProtocol","author":"Adam Masur","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20to%20Make%20Digital%20Credentials%20Your%20Most%20Impactful%20Marketing%20Tool.png?width=427&name=How%20to%20Make%20Digital%20Credentials%20Your%20Most%20Impactful%20Marketing%20Tool.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn95@2020_1/2020/08/16/13-48-37-939_f2f3e8a420d8da75.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Hubspot%20Article_Email%20Example.png?width=381&name=Hubspot%20Article_Email%20Example.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn60@2020_3/2020/08/16/13-48-31-569_83fedb2362a96f80.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Hubspot%20Example_Online%20Landing%20Page.png?width=1172&name=Hubspot%20Example_Online%20Landing%20Page.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn55@2020_1/2020/08/16/13-48-35-751_05965a407430c494.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Hubspot%20Example_Event%20Flyer.png?width=541&name=Hubspot%20Example_Event%20Flyer.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn19@2020_1/2020/08/16/13-48-39-032_ca32349614f22d1f.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fdigital-credentials&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn12@2020_4/2020/08/16/13-48-32-705_8c978c1062e98dd3.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 21:48:25","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 21:48:25","title":"How to Design Content Remarketing Campaigns That Actually Work","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/design-content-remarketing-campaigns","description":"<p>You know content marketing works, so you've been plugging away at blog posts, ebooks, and other valuable, educational content for your potential customers.</p> \n<p>And people come -- they find your content in search results and in their social media feeds.

It's not always because they're not interested in your message -- so how do you recapture those viewers who left your site?</p> \n<p>Recapturing audience attention to turn lookers into leads is an effective marketing tactic, and if you're not doing it, you're leaving money on the table.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Let me outline for you the sections I'm going to cover in this post:</p> \n<ol> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/design-content-remarketing-campaigns#what-is-remarketing\">What the Heck is Remarketing?</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/design-content-remarketing-campaigns#what-is-gdn\">What Is the Google Display Network?</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/design-content-remarketing-campaigns#campaign-examples\">Remarketing Campaign Examples</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/design-content-remarketing-campaigns#set-up-remarketing-campaign\">How to Set Up a Remarketing Campaign</a></li> \n</ol> \n<a></a> \n<div class=\"hsg-featured-snippet\"> \n <h2>What the Heck Is Remarketing?</h2> \n <p>At its core, remarketing is the process of tagging your site visitors and targeting them with content after they leave your site in an effort to reengage them and bring them back to your site.</p> \n</div> \n<p>Remarketing gives you the opportunity to appear in front of people who have already expressed an interest in your website. They could be checking their email, reading the news, watching a YouTube video… and there you are, with something new and awesome to show them. It could be a reminder to complete an action they had started, or a new piece of content to further a buying decision, and so on.</p> \n<p>Remarketing provides the opportunity to:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Turn bounced website visitors into leads.</li> \n <li>Increase brand recall (and thus increase branded searches).</li> \n <li>Increase repeat visitor rates and engagement.</li> \n <li>Increase the effectiveness of search engine optimization (SEO) and content marketing.</li> \n</ul> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" style=\"width: 650px;\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-1811089655-png/Remarketing1.png?width=650&amp;name=Remarketing1.png\" width=\"650\" alt=\"a graphic illustrating all the users who visited your website vs. bringing them back to your website\" /></p> \n<p>A common stat in the industry is that <strong>96% of people who visit a website leave without completing the action the marketer would have liked them to take.</strong> Remarketing gives you a second chance to make that first impression (and even a third, and a fourth). We can't afford to be forgettable -- we have to make our content more <em>sticky</em>.</p> \n<p>Alright, so we understand both the problem and the opportunity. Now, let's dive into the solution.&nbsp;You're going to learn how to use remarketing strategies with the Google Display Network to dramatically increase the effectiveness of your inbound marketing efforts.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2><strong>What Is the Google Display Network?</strong></h2> \n<p>The Google Display Network is a group of websites where your Google display (banner) ads can appear. <br><br>More than 2 million sites are in the network, including heavily trafficked ones such as YouTube. Google estimates that the <a href=\"https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/117120?hl=en\">GDN can reach 90% of people on the internet</a>. <br><br>Who you reach and how often will depend on your ad targeting (more on that later).</br></br></br></br></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" style=\"width: 600px; margin: 0px auto;\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-1809803507-png/Remarketing2.png?width=600&amp;name=Remarketing2.png\" alt=\"graphic that shows google display network's reach in the US across millions of sites, videos, and devices including LinkedIn, CNN, lastfm, eHow, xe, howstuffworks, The New York Times, YouTube, Blogger, Gmail, Google Finance, and Google maps\" width=\"600\" /></p> \n<a></a> \n<h2><strong>Remarking Campaign Examples</strong></h2> \n<p>To further underscore the opportunity that remarketing has to offer, there are some really cool campaign types that you can dig into.</p> \n<h3>Online Activity</h3> \n<p>By far the most common remarketing tactic is creating an audience based on their behavior on your website. Your options here are virtually endless — with parameters such as by number of page views (indicating a high level of interest) or by which pages viewed (indicating intent).</p> \n<p>Here are some ideas for using this type of campaign:</p> \n<h4>Targeting by Buyer's Journey Stage</h4> \n<p>Your blog posts are earlier in the buyer's journey than other pages on your site. That means you'd match their intent with an ad that moves them further down their journey rather than one that sells. Targeting by topic or category-say you run a bakery. Why run general ads to audiences that landed on your wedding-related content? Instead, you'd target them with more personalized ads around wedding cakes and desserts.</p> \n<h4>Targeting by Intent</h4> \n<p>Aside from just topic, there's a lot you can learn from your audience's site behavior. For example, visiting a product page indicates interest, but not making it to checkout could mean a price objection or other friction. This means you need to sweeten the deal in some way (like a promo or discount).</p> \n<h4>Past Purchases</h4> \n<p>You can also target those that did make it through your purchasing process and target them with ads to earn an upsell.</p> \n<h3><strong>YouTube TrueView</strong></h3> \n<p>The human race spends billions of hours every month watching YouTube ads. You may have your own YouTube content, but perhaps your viewing metrics aren’t quite as high as you’d like them to be, or perhaps your users have no idea you have interesting video content to share.</p> \n<p>Using <a href=\"http://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/01/15/youtube-remarketing\">YouTube TrueView ads</a>, you can target your audiences as they are watching other videos on YouTube.</p> \n<p>Take the screenshot below, for example.&nbsp;I’m trying to watch a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle video and it’s showing me an ad for a tourism company in Italy. Why? Because I was planning a trip to Florence at the time I took this screenshot, and they’re remarketing to me.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-1811335425-png/Remarketing995.png?width=551&amp;name=Remarketing995.png\" width=\"551\" style=\"width: 551px; margin: 0px auto;\" alt=\"image ad in youtube video\" /></p> \n<p>The cool thing about TrueView videos is that you only pay if people view your video content. There’s no cost if the person clicks on the “skip ad” button. If you’re creating video content, why wouldn’t you pay a few bucks to promote it?</p> \n<h3>Video Views</h3> \n<p>Speaking of YouTube, your visitors don't even need to make it to your website in order for you to retarget them. If you have a solid YouTube presence, you can create an audience based on video views. If someone watched one of your videos, you can create a display campaign that shows them your ads even beyond the YouTube platform.</p> \n<h3><strong>Remarketing Lists for Search Ads (RLSA)</strong></h3> \n<p>Here’s another interesting but advanced thing you can do. It’s a little complicated, but I promise it's awesome. It’s called Remarking Lists for Search Ads.</p> \n<p>RLSA lets you target people in your audiences with customized ads when they perform searches for specific keywords on Google.&nbsp;</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-1809994192-png/Remarketing998.png?width=522&amp;name=Remarketing998.png\" width=\"522\" style=\"width: 522px; margin: 0px auto;\" alt=\"graphic illustrating RLSA process: users visit your site, get added to your remarketing list, then you show them customized ads when they search on Google\" /></p> \n<p>Say, for example, someone visits your site. You tag them, and now they’re in one of your audiences.</p> \n<p>That person then searches for a competitor of yours. This probably means they’re doing some comparison shopping.</p> \n<p>Using RLSA, you can target that comparison shopper with a specific ad, like a 10% discount code or something similar. Knowing that the person visited specific pages on your site and is now performing specific searches, it’s possible to come up with very specific and compelling ad copy.</p> \n<h3>Bonus: Remarketing With Facebook</h3> \n<p>Noticeably absent from the GDN is Facebook, the other big player on the web, and that's because they have their own remarketing system through Facebook Custom Audiences.</p> \n<p>It works in much the same way — the difference being that ads are shown to users within the Facebook platform.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2><strong>How to Set Up a Remarketing Campaign With Google Ads</strong></h2> \n<p>Like I said earlier, using the GDN for remarketing gives you a great deal of reach. Generally, you can find your tagged site visitors on the network many times per day, several days per week, and across many different sites.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3><strong>1. Define your audience.</strong></h3> \n<p>One of your first steps in remarketing is to define the specific audience(s) you want to remarket to. For example, you could create an audience for people who visited your blog or for people who visited specific pages on your website, like your pricing page. This will enable you to reach out to<em> just</em> those people with offers and messaging to suit their interests.</p> \n<p>To define an audience, <a href=\"https://support.google.com/adwords/answer/2454064?hl=en\">create a new remarketing list</a> in Google Ad. Google will take care of setting all of the cookies; all<em> you</em> need to do is specify which website visitors to include or exclude from your audience.&nbsp;</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" style=\"width: 600px; margin: 0px auto;\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-1809833607-png/Remarketing4.png?width=600&amp;name=Remarketing4.png\" alt=\"new remarketing list interface within google ads\" width=\"600\" /></p> \n<p>Segmenting different lists of users enables you to show different ads, depending on which section of your site they visited.</p> \n<p>A secondary benefit is that you can bid more aggressively to get more impressions and higher ad positions, and to get visitors to the higher value sections of your website. For example, your data might show that visitors to your pricing or product page are more valuable than your blog visitors.</p> \n<p>Another creative remarketing strategy for content marketers is to <a href=\"http://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2012/02/09/how-to-create-adwords-audiences\">define audience categories</a> in Google Ads based on the different post categories in your blog. If you already have a ton of blog content that is classified by topic, leverage those existing classifications in your remarketing audience definition strategy.</p> \n<h3><strong>3. Set audience membership duration.</strong></h3> \n<p>In remarketing, the audience membership duration is the number of days that you follow a user around with your ads. For example, if I set my audience membership duration to 60 days, then users who visit my site will see my ads for 60 days. You can test and tweak this number to see what's right for your audience.</p> \n<p>Ad fatigue is a real thing in every industry and across every medium: TV, radio, print … and, yes, display ads.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Now, I'd like to address a concern I've heard from some fellow marketers: that overly aggressive remarketing will make your prospective customer feel uncomfortable.&nbsp;Let's look at a few facts and see just how \"creepy\" remarketing really is.</p> According to \n<a href=\"https://kenshoo.com/blog/retargeting-stats/\">Kenshoo</a>, retargeting can lift ad engagement rates up to 400%, 60% of consumers are neutral about the topic of retargeting ads, and 25% say they actually like them. \n<a href=\"https://blog.wishpond.com/post/97225536354/infographic-7-incredible-retargeting-ad-stats\">Wishpond</a> reports that the average click-through rate for retargeted ads is 10 times that of a regular display ad, and retargeting can lead to a 726% lift in site visitation after four weeks of exposure. \n<p>So, be bold!&nbsp;People visited your site for a reason, and past browsing history is among the strongest predictors of future purchasing intent.&nbsp;It’s worth testing out remarketing with relatively higher impression caps and membership durations and seeing what happens. <strong>A</strong><strong>s long as your offers and messaging are on target and you're providing value, it's not creepy.&nbsp;</strong>I would suggest:</p> \n<ul> \n <li class=\"normalCxSpMiddle\">Try setting your audience membership duration to an amount equal to 3x your average sale cycle length.</li> \n <li class=\"normalCxSpMiddle\">If it typically takes an average of one week to go from first touch to sale, set the<strong> audience membership duration to three weeks.</strong></li> \n <li class=\"normalCxSpMiddle\">Don’t worry too much about impression caps. (Remember, more impressions means higher conversion rates. Consider <strong style=\"font-size: inherit;\"><em>rotating though multiple ads per campaign</em></strong> to combat ad fatigue.)</li> \n</ul> \n<h3><strong>3. Create a killer ad.</strong></h3> \n<p>Now that we’ve talked about defining an audience to remarket to, let's focus on how to create killer remarketing ads.</p> \n<h4><strong>Understand Ad Formats on the GDN</strong></h4> \n<p>There are several different display ad formats on the Google Display Network, some of which are shown below.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/google-display-ads-responsive-formats.jpg?width=600&amp;name=google-display-ads-responsive-formats.jpg\" alt=\"examples of google display ads responsive formats\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; margin: 0px auto;\"><a href=\"https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/23/google-display-ads\">Image Source</a><br><br /></br></img></p> \n<table style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: table;\"> \n <tbody> \n  <tr style=\"height: 21px;\"> \n   <td style=\"height: 21px;\">Type</td> \n   <td style=\"height: 21px;\">Dimensions</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr style=\"height: 21px;\"> \n   <td style=\"height: 21px;\">Mobile</td> \n   <td style=\"height: 21px;\">300x250, 320x50, 320x100, 250x250, 200x200</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr style=\"height: 21px;\"> \n   <td style=\"height: 21px;\">Desktop</td> \n   <td style=\"height: 21px;\">300x250, 336x280, 728x90, 300x600, 160x600, 970x90, 468x60</td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table> \n<p><br>Ad formats matter to marketers because of how the ad auction works. Different ad formats do not compete against each other for positioning, as shown in this screenshot:</br></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" style=\"width: 600px; margin: 0px auto;\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-1811230125-png/Remarketing9.png?width=600&amp;name=Remarketing9.png\" alt=\"example webpage with multiple display ads: shows that different ad formats do not compete against each other but same format ads still do\" width=\"600\" /></p> \n<h4><strong>Write Copy That Resonates Emotionally</strong></h4> \n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.neurosciencemarketing.com/blog/articles/emotional-ads-work-best.htm\">neurosciencemarketing.com</a>, an emotional approach in advertising is nearly twice as effective as a rational approach. The same emotions that draw people to your content will drive people to click on your ads.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The key here is to create ads that resonate with users on an emotional level. Stay away from boring, plain, informational ads that look the same as every other ad out there. Instead, create ads that <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/emotion-marketing\">appeal to your audience on an emotional level</a>.</p> \n<p>Content marketers are uniquely qualified to become fabulous PPC marketers. Why?&nbsp;Because so much of the success and failure of PPC marketing relies on the creativity of your ads.</p> \n<p>For example,&nbsp;look at these ads for a search of “Big Data Solutions” -- the ads are essentially all the same:</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" style=\"width: 650px;\" title=\"Remarketing992\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-1811305370-png/Remarketing992.png?width=650&amp;name=Remarketing992.png\" width=\"650\" alt=\"ads for &quot;big data solutions&quot; where none of the competing advertisers have unique ad headlines\" /></p> \n<p>Content marketers, on the other hand, tend to have a few creative bones in their bodies. I call this a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/01/29/hacking-adwords\">Google Ads Jackpot</a>&nbsp;because it reminds me of hitting a row of lucky 7s in Vegas -- I just hit a Big Data Solutions jackpot! If you can come up with an emotionally charged, totally different and stand-out ad,&nbsp;you can blow away the competition.</p> \n<h3><strong>4. Perform ongoing CTR optimization.</strong></h3> \n<p>Google doesn’t make money by showing ads no one clicks on, so it makes sense for them to show ads that are more likely to get clicks. They use&nbsp;an algorithm called&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.wordstream.com/quality-score\">Quality Score</a>&nbsp;to determine which ads to show, what position each will display in, and how much to charge the advertiser for each ad click.</p> \n<p>To provide an incentive for advertisers to create great ads, they give out huge discounts for ads with high clickthrough rates… and dish out huge penalties for ads with low clickthrough rates.</p> \n<p>This all sounds good in theory, but how do you create an ad with high clickthrough rate?</p> \n<h4><strong>1. Send people to your high-value offers.&nbsp;</strong></h4> \n<p>What should you be featuring in your image ads? The most common tactic is to simply promote your highest value offers, like a free trial of your product, a request for a demo, etc. This is my top-performing ad:&nbsp;</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-1809918942-png/Remarketing97.png?width=463&amp;name=Remarketing97.png\" alt=\"remarketing ad from wordstream with a puppy on it that says &quot;my dog ate my ppc! no more excuses for poor results&quot;\" width=\"463\" style=\"width: 463px; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<p>Of course it has a cute puppy. How could it not? Make people&nbsp;love your ads, not dread them.</p> \n<h4><strong>2.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Do a conversion path analysis.</strong></h4> \n<p>The goal here is to figure out which pages on your site, if visited during a user’s session, result in a much higher probability of the user converting to a lead or a sale. For example, the highest converting page on your site could be your product overview page.&nbsp;Come up with a list like this one and target those pages in your remarketing audience.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-1809918967-png/Remarketing98.png?width=444&amp;name=Remarketing98.png\" alt=\"excel spreadsheet showing different pages and their conversion rates, indicating the top converting pages are ideal for remarketing\" width=\"444\" style=\"width: 444px; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<h4>3. Send people to your best content.</h4> \n<p>Check out this ad from my colleague <a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/in/aimclear\">Marty Weintraub</a> at AimClear, which sends anyone who clicks to his PPC analyses.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" style=\"width: 600px; margin: 0px auto;\" title=\"Remarketing99\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-1808175089-png/Remarketing99.png?width=600&amp;name=Remarketing99.png\" alt=\"remarketing ad at the top of a page that says &quot;10 kevlar ppc analyses and process for a bulletproof account&quot;\" width=\"600\" /></p> \n<p>But how do you know what content to feature in your ads?</p> \n<h4><strong>4. Analyze social shares on your blog content. </strong></h4> \n<p>If you analyze your blog content, what you’ll usually find is that around 5% of your pages generate half of the shares on social media.</p> \n<p>For example, I analyzed all of the articles on one business blog over the last year and found that on average, a typical article gets several hundred shares on social media. However, the top 5% of articles gets tens of thousands of social shares.&nbsp;Not surprisingly, we found that the same stories that work well on social media also tend to do very well as featured content within ads.</p> \n<h3><strong>5. Get strategic with bid management.</strong></h3> \n<p>Now that you have remarketing audiences and ads down to a science, let's turn our attention to bid management strategies.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Remember, in PPC marketing, you have to pay for each click. The advertiser specifies a maximum cost per click that they’re willing to pay, but the key here is not to buy every possible click.&nbsp;Rather, you want to be super picky and just cherry-pick the clicks that are the most relevant to your business. The way to do this is through bid management.</p> \n<p>It doesn’t make any sense to remarket ads to everyone in your audience. Why? Because not everyone who visits your website is a qualified buyer.</p> \n<p>With Google Ads, you can overlay user demographic information on top of your remarketing audiences to find the needles in the haystack. For example, someone from Zimbabwe could visit your site -- but they can't convert if you can't ship there.</p> \n<p>Here’s when it comes in handy to know a thing or two about your <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/make-my-persona\">target customer persona</a>.</p> \n<ul> \n <li>What are the ages?</li> \n <li>Parental status?</li> \n <li>Where do they live?</li> \n <li>Gender?</li> \n <li>What time do they search for your products?</li> \n <li>What is their income?</li> \n</ul> \n<p>You can be very picky, and <em>just</em> bid for the people in your audience who also meet your demographic filters.</p> \n<p>You've done your research, you know your topic, you have something interesting and entertaining to say -- but sometimes you need that extra push. As individuals and brands have become publishers, the game has been upped big time. Competition is fierce.</p> \n<p>With remarketing, we at WordStream increased our repeat visitors by 50%, tripled our average time on site, and saw a huge increase in direct visits to our site.</p> \n<p>In short, content remarketing enabled us to maximize the value of every piece of content we put out. We were able to get each piece in front of the audience with the most intent, at the right time, and via the right channels.</p> \n<p>You can achieve this kind of success too with a killer remarketing campaign and the right advertising plan.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p> \n<p><em>Editor's note: This post was originally published in October 2014 and has been updated for comprehensiveness.</em></p> \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fdesign-content-remarketing-campaigns&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \" />","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 14 Aug 2020 20:30:00 +0000","feedId":924,"bgimg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/remarketing-campaign.jpg#keepProtocol","linkMd5":"db6f2d622208acfd36a8fd982db57de6","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn100@2020_4/2020/08/16/13-48-28-500_a412371fea3f7bed.webp","metaImg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/remarketing-campaign.jpg#keepProtocol","author":"Larry Kim","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-1811089655-png/Remarketing1.png?width=650&name=Remarketing1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn47@2020_4/2020/08/16/13-48-32-314_7f9d6bef4c26dd7d.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-1809803507-png/Remarketing2.png?width=600&name=Remarketing2.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn80@2020_4/2020/08/16/13-48-33-414_a3b51dcf9b6a5942.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-1811335425-png/Remarketing995.png?width=551&name=Remarketing995.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn72@2020_4/2020/08/16/13-48-30-858_e0b8d834d22e645a.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-1809994192-png/Remarketing998.png?width=522&name=Remarketing998.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn19@2020_6/2020/08/16/13-48-32-386_70e98a5efa6eb181.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-1809833607-png/Remarketing4.png?width=600&name=Remarketing4.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx20/cdn23@2020_4/2020/08/16/13-48-36-473_e6cabad0f0a4d023.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/google-display-ads-responsive-formats.jpg?width=600&name=google-display-ads-responsive-formats.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn19@2020_1/2020/08/16/13-48-30-961_6e97d8123a28fc27.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-1811230125-png/Remarketing9.png?width=600&name=Remarketing9.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn79@2020_2/2020/08/16/13-48-30-872_bb594b382858491f.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-1811305370-png/Remarketing992.png?width=650&name=Remarketing992.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn15@2020_2/2020/08/16/13-48-29-899_515561343d895aeb.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-1809918942-png/Remarketing97.png?width=463&name=Remarketing97.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn75@2020_3/2020/08/16/13-48-34-232_d1cb5c874a3097ff.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-1809918967-png/Remarketing98.png?width=444&name=Remarketing98.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn39@2020_4/2020/08/16/13-48-32-229_a7dfbc18e5136323.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-1808175089-png/Remarketing99.png?width=600&name=Remarketing99.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn83@2020_6/2020/08/16/13-48-34-510_c6c0d33a392e7f64.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fdesign-content-remarketing-campaigns&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn64@2020_1/2020/08/16/13-48-39-809_b7a9a25e68780be2.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 21:48:26","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 21:48:26","title":"The 17 Best Resume Templates for Every Type of Professional","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/best-resume-templates","description":"<p>While an eye-catching resume alone probably won't land you your dream gig, it doesn't hurt to put a little extra effort into how you present yourself on paper.</p>  \n<p>The right resume design speaks to your individual skills and personality, and can propel your application to the top of the stack.

Google","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/blogging-for-seo","description":"<p>If you've ever written a blog post before, you know how much time they can take.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>From topic selection, to gathering research, to writing the post and pressing \"Publish,\" the process often demands hours.</p> \n<p>That's why, if your post <em>doesn't</em> earn the traffic you expected, it can be a major letdown. All that work that goes into a post for less-than-stellar engagement is, no doubt, one of the most frustrating experiences.</p> \n<p>Fortunately, there's a way to combat low traffic and bring eyes to your writing: search engine optimization. <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/seo\"><span>SEO</span></a> is a language that speaks specifically to search engines like Google to tell it your post deserves to be at the top of search engine results pages (SERPs).</p> \n<p>As marketers, we're always aiming to write content that'll rank highly on Google, and SEO is the bridge that'll help you get there.</p> \n<p>Of course, that begs the question: How do you write in SEO's language?</p> \n<p>For that, don't worry — we've got you covered. In this post, we're going to dive into 13 ways you can master writing for that high ranking your content deserves.</p> \n<p>Ready to get started?</p> \n<h3>1. Use headings to your benefit.</h3> \n<p>Headers tell Google what different sections of your blog article will be about. In this post, for example, the header, \"How To Write Blog Posts for SEO,\" tells the search engine what this section is about.</p> \n<p>Users who type search queries like, \"writing for SEO\" into Google will likely come across this post because of what the header tells Google. Ultimately, search engines are going to look at <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/blog-search-engine-optimization?_ga=2.256326411.1692937882.1597029621-940436819.1565181751\"><span>headers and snippets before they look at body text</span></a>.</p> \n<p>Think of Google as a reader who is skimming your blog. They're going to focus on the main ideas — and that's what headers, like H2s and H3s, display. Use headers to accurately convey the main idea of your section, but make sure each header uses accurate, high-intent keywords. When you use the right keywords (using <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/22842/4-helpful-tools-for-identifying-the-right-keywords.aspx?_ga=2.256326411.1692937882.1597029621-940436819.1565181751\"><span>keyword research tools</span></a>) you have a much higher chance of helping your post rank on the first page.</p> \n<h3>2. Take advantage of featured snippets.</h3> \n<p>According to <a href=\"https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/9351707?p=featured_snippets&amp;hl=en&amp;visit_id=637322668994927457-279137339&amp;rd=1\"><span>Google</span></a>, \"Featured snippets come from web search listings. Google's automated systems determine whether a page would make a good featured snippet to highlight for a specific search request.\"</p> \n<p>Featured snippets on Google are the most direct answers to search queries. For instance, if I were to search, \"How do you write a blog post?\", Google might use a featured snippet to show the most sufficient answer:</p> \n<p><span style=\"border: none;\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/jkrLX_FCneOwRvR527KfiHOfFW4ZYp15QeyUkS8X363Wr52Q5NKHlUw2JCvyFVAGwgi7k5CTIka7eKnNWO7XNaIHBbzMknV1lBsQCiE5ogQZdW0Yw0y1EGJbrB58OcHM8C1tY8IE\" width=\"624\" height=\"436\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" alt=\"Example of a featured snippet on Google.\" /></span></p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-featured-snippet-box?_ga=2.256326411.1692937882.1597029621-940436819.1565181751\"><span>To earn a featured snippet</span></a> on Google, you'll want to answer the questions readers might have when they come to your blog post. For instance, if the search term is \"how should I write a blog post?\", answer that question with a list, starting with \"How to Write A Blog Post\" as the header, accompanied by a list of items that are relevant and actionable.</p> \n<p>If you're wondering how to make list items actionable, a good rule of thumb is to write complete sentences and start each sentence with a verb, like \"Write\", \"Research\", \"Create\". Additionally, make sure each sentence answers the question or challenge. For definitions, or <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/winning-googles-featured-snippet?_ga=2.210163477.1692937882.1597029621-940436819.1565181751\"><span>paragraph snippets</span></a>, make sure they're succinct, but give enough background to explain the word or phrase.</p> \n<h3>3. Write to answer questions for customers.</h3> \n<p>One of the reasons we write blog posts is to diversify the content on our website. Another reason is to boost the credibility of our business. But if \"to solve for your audience\" isn't in your list of reasons, you may be losing out on key SEO opportunities.</p> \n<p>Google answers countless questions a day. For instance, I must've Googled about five questions in the last hour alone. When you frame posts to answer the queries of your audience, Google will see that and push your post to a higher page.</p> \n<p>Earlier, we talked about the bells and whistles you can add to posts to boost rankings. But, additionally, you'll want to ensure the content you're beefing up is also working towards that goal.</p> \n<p>If you're stuck on trying to figure out what your audience is asking, you'll want to perform keyword research. Sites like <a href=\"http://ahrefs.com/\"><span>Ahrefs</span></a> and <a href=\"http://woorank.com/\"><span>Woorank</span></a> crawl search engines for popular search queries. To organize the process, create different topic clusters to write about, such as \"Instagram Marketing,\" \"LinkedIn Advertising\" — subjects you can dive into that provide value to your audience.</p> \n<p>Still stuck on keywords? Don't worry — this <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-do-keyword-research-ht?_ga=2.210163477.1692937882.1597029621-940436819.1565181751\"><span>keyword research guide is perfect for beginners.</span></a></p> \n<h3>4. Use meta descriptions to your advantage.</h3> \n<p>Are you adding meta descriptions to your post? If your answer is \"No,\" then you're probably not giving your post the most exposure possible. Let's get into why they're important.</p> \n<p>By now, we've talked about a couple of the ways a blog post can communicate with Google: with headers, keywords, and snippets. However, that's not an exhaustive list.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/meta-descriptions?_ga=2.210163477.1692937882.1597029621-940436819.1565181751\"><span>Meta descriptions</span></a> is another method Google leverages when ranking search results. Meta descriptions are the 1-3 sentence descriptions you'll find underneath the title of a result.</p> \n<p><span style=\"border: none;\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/SthW36UwXSSgw6xA9MsSlcduXxbbMVKP3QpXTdUdc1KGMa4pqGAvSipqTkuL-TZICne4Dr-WXlVVEDagqYlDYavLLIPJEzesocOU6Gy9_qEHPbWEGmvwB6vIZJmd5zRmxy0YbxCg\" width=\"624\" height=\"227\" alt=\"Example of a meta description on Google.\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" /></span></p> \n<p>Use meta descriptions to sum up what your post is about. Remember to keep it short, use keywords, and make sure it's engaging. After all, there are going to be loads of posts similar to yours, aiming to rank at #1. You're going to want yours to stand out above the rest.</p> \n<p>Most blogging software have meta description boxes built into the toolbar or post formatting options, so you won't have to look far to use the function. <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/?_ga=2.216912790.1692937882.1597029621-940436819.1565181751\"><span>HubSpot</span></a> and <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/\"><span>WordPress</span></a>, for example, point out where to add meta descriptions in the post editor.</p> \n<h3>5. Add alt text to images.</h3> \n<p>With any image you add to your post — whether it be the featured image or a body text one — you'll want to add alt text. <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/32567/a-marketer-s-guide-to-optimizing-images-for-google-search.aspx?_ga=2.216912790.1692937882.1597029621-940436819.1565181751\"><span>Alt text describes what's happening</span></a> in the photo. Think of it as a closed caption for images.</p> \n<p>Alt text helps Google, as well as those who are visually impaired, understand why the photo is in your post. This improves your article's rank and accessibility, making it more shareable.</p> \n<p>For instance, if you include an infographic about audience segmentation, the alt text should read something like, \"A helpful infographic that explains audience segmentation.\" Notice how this sentence uses keywords to appeal to Google even further.</p> \n<p>Now let's say you're using a stock image as a featured photo, but it doesn't necessarily depict anything that relates to your post's content. For instance, let's say your topic is click-through rate, and this is your featured image:</p> \n<p><span style=\"border: none;\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/2jNZPSwpDQmCpp93qSsfmJzrztmQR8rQSjoBxLZDUz6vQLjPKBNCkbd2_njQNqt5lVzCZPFEV70MJmreYxiRHjUSU8yFvmJI6ZIhHHe1Kt5gKjwFk6ZbBvVM1-rC_pfTdREJUSih\" width=\"624\" height=\"416\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" alt=\"A marketing team discusses audience segmentation strategy.\" /></span></p> \n<p>This doesn't really have anything to do with audience segments, right? But what you can do to remedy the situation is to make a scenario. For instance, \"A marketing team discusses audience segmentation strategy.\"</p> \n<p>This alt text uses keywords to describe a situation that fits into the theme of the post. That way, your image doesn't bring down the ranking of your post, but works towards improving where it ranks. If Google sees alt text, it's another box checked for a high position on SERPs.</p> \n<h3>6. Don't limit keywords to the body of your post.</h3> \n<p>Ultimately, keywords should be used in nearly every part of your blog. We've talked a little about where keywords can be included in your post: snippets, photos, and headers, for example.</p> \n<p>Keywords are so powerful because they're the jumping off point for SERPs. Google will always take what browsers type into the search bar and search for web pages with those exact words. So it's important to make sure every element, from the post title, to the calls-to-action, relate to your keywords.</p> \n<p>That said, it's also important not to keyword stuff your post. The goal is to make your page fully optimized, not overbearing. Find natural fits for keyword additions, but don't force them so your content is illegible.</p> \n<p>For example, if your keywords are \"account based marketing,\" \"startups,\" and \"sales,\" your meta description <em>shouldn't</em> be something like:</p> \n<p>\"Sales for account based marketing startups.\"</p> \n<p>Instead, try focusing on one or two phrases to make the description more natural:</p> \n<p>\"Are you looking for killer strategies to boost your account-based marketing game? Find out our surefire secrets in this post.\"</p> \n<p>That way, you're still using keywords, but you're not oversaturating the post to the point where it's illegible. Remember, even though Google is a search engine, it still has to comprehend your post in order to recommend it to website browsers. Additionally, a reader's experience will determine how well your posts rank. If readers bounce from your webpage because it's confusing to them, that will signal to Google that your post isn't good enough to rank.</p> \n<h3>7. Identify highly-effective keywords when looking for post ideas.</h3> \n<p>Google handles <a href=\"http://www.internetlivestats.com/google-search-statistics/\">over 40,000 search queries</a> a second. Staggering, right? If you want to cut through search result clutter and outrank your competitors, you need to target the specific keywords and phrases your potential customers are searching. How else will they find your content and website?</p> \n<p>To identify those hot keywords, head on over to the social platforms your target audience frequents and see what’s trending. Pay close attention to the exact phrases they use and monitor popular industry terms and topics.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.google.com/trends/\">Google Trends</a> can also give you a feel for what keywords are popular at any given time. If you see searches are steadily declining over time for a specific keyword, you know that’s probably not the right keyword to target for your marketing and vice versa for increasing trends.</p> \n<p>If you’re ever running low on keyword ideas, get inspiration from your competition. Use tools to see what keywords they’re currently ranking for — if these keywords are relevant to your business, consider using them too! <a href=\"https://www.semrush.com/\">SEMRush</a> lets you enter a competitor and see the keywords they’re ranking for, their position in search results, traffic received for that keyword and other key metrics.</p> \n<p>Keep in mind that the most obvious keywords aren’t always the best keywords. Searchers tend to use very specific “long-tail” keywords, keyword phrases and questions when they’re looking for something.</p> \n<p>Long-tail keywords comprise up to <a href=\"https://www.hittail.com/blog/the-hidden-value-of-long-tail-seo\">70% of all search traffic</a> and can unlock the door to successful SEO. When <a href=\"http://www.wpbeginner.com/\">WPBeginner</a>, the largest WordPress resource site for WordPress beginners, adopted a long-tail SEO strategy, they increased their organic search traffic by <a href=\"http://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-we-increased-our-organic-search-traffic-by-using-hittail/\">20% in just two months</a>!</p> \n<p>Because you face fierce competition for shorter, more general keywords, you often have a better chance of ranking in the top results for long-tail keywords. And, long-tail keywords allow you to zero in on higher quality website traffic that often knows what they’re looking for and may be farther along in the buyer’s journey.</p> \n<p>Once you’ve done your research and built a list of what you think are the most valuable, relevant keywords, plug them into a keyword research tool like Google’s <a href=\"https://adwords.google.com/KeywordPlanner\">Keyword Planner</a>, <a href=\"https://moz.com/products/pro/keyword-explorer\">Moz’s Keyword Explorer</a>, <a href=\"https://keywordseverywhere.com/ubersuggest.html\">Ubersuggest</a>, <a href=\"http://keywordtool.io/\">Keyword Tool</a> and so on. Many keyword research tools give you the monthly volume for any given keyword. Test out different keyword tools — marketers are drawn to different ones for different reasons.</p> \n<p>Depending on your business or industry (or budget or bandwidth for SEO efforts), it may be important to rank for high competition, short tail keywords. Still, try to also optimize for a healthy dose of long-tail keywords that are high in search volume but low in competition. You may find it’s much easier to rank for these words.</p> \n<p>Remember that your focus keywords will evolve over time as trends shift, terminology changes or your product/service line changes. Be sure to conduct keyword research periodically to ensure you’re still focusing on the right keywords for your target audience and not missing out on vital ranking opportunities.</p> \n<h3>8. Naturally integrate those keywords throughout your posts.</h3> \n<p>Once you’ve decided on a list of target keywords, it’s time to write a blog post focused on one of these keywords. Brainstorm blog topics with your team and decide on a topic that will entice and engage your target audience.</p> \n<p>Keep your <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33491/Everything-Marketers-Need-to-Research-Create-Detailed-Buyer-Personas-Template.aspx\">buyer personas</a>, their motivations, challenges, interests, etc. in mind throughout the brainstorming process. Choose a topic that will <a href=\"http://experience.stratusinteractive.com/blog/how-to-create-an-emotional-connection-with-prospects-to-turn-them-into-customers\">emotionally resonate</a> with your potential customers and their needs, desires or pains.</p> \n<p>As you write your blog, your keyword and natural variations should be regularly interspersed throughout the post. Your primary keyword should appear in these key places:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/blogging-for-seo#BlogPostTitle\">Title</a></li> \n <li>Headings and subheadings</li> \n <li>URL if possible</li> \n <li>Image alt text (search engines can’t read images)</li> \n <li>Meta description</li> \n <li>Throughout the content</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Remember that you’re writing for humans, not search engines. Focus on engaging readers with a natural writing style that takes their needs and interests into account.</p> \n<h3>9. Link to influential websites.</h3> \n<p>As you build out your blog post, don’t be afraid to link to other articles or blogs.</p> \n<p>Linking to applicable and reputable websites not only offers blog readers additional reading material to expand their knowledge, but it also shows Google and other search engines that you’ve done your research. And the blogger or writer may even return the favor and link to your site.</p> \n<p>Nothing strengthens a blog post like hard-to-argue-with, research-backed statistics from influential websites. Compelling stats help you build a more convincing and concrete argument that will get your readers thinking (especially when they’re from trustworthy sites they know and love).</p> \n<h3>10. Aim for scannable, longer posts.</h3> \n<p>In an age of short attention spans (<a href=\"http://time.com/3858309/attention-spans-goldfish/\">average of 8 seconds for humans</a>), you would think shorter blog posts are the way to go. But search engines actually prefer longer, in-depth blog posts.</p> \n<p>The longer your blog post, the greater its chance of appearing in the top search engine results. <a href=\"http://blog.serpiq.com/how-important-is-content-length-why-data-driven-seo-trumps-guru-opinions/\">SerpIQ found</a> that the 10th position pages have 400 fewer words than 1st position pages. Longer posts will rank more easily for your target keyword.</p> \n<p>Think about it: the more content on the page, the more clues search engines have to figure out what your blog is about. We recommend writing a minimum of <a href=\"https://yoast.com/blog-post-length/\">300 words per blog post</a>. This length gives search engines plenty of keywords and text to crawl and helps them understand what your blog is about.</p> \n<p>The downside to longer blogs is that they may scare off your readers. We live in a world of skimmers and scanners. In a heat map analysis, CoSchedule learned that <a href=\"http://coschedule.com/blog/read-your-content/\">only 10-20% of their readers</a> were making it to the bottom of their posts. So, the million dollar question is, how can longer blog posts appeal to today’s online readers?</p> \n<p>You can write <a href=\"http://experience.stratusinteractive.com/blog/scannable-content-your-key-to-writing-successful-blogs\">scannable</a>, readable blog posts that hook online readers by tightening up your sentences and paragraphs. Turn a long-winded sentence into two. Keep your paragraphs to 2-3 sentences max.</p> \n<p>Also, take full advantage of bulleted lists and subheadings that grab reader’s attention. By following these tactics, you’ll create blogs that are easier to read (especially on a mobile device!) and less intimidating to the scanner’s eye.</p> \n<h3>11. Internally link words or phrases to other posts on your site.</h3> \n<p>Linking to other pages or blog posts on your website helps search engines crawl your website and create a more accurate sitemap. It also helps your audience discover more of your content and get to know you as a trustworthy, credible source of information.</p> \n<p>Internal links to other valuable content keep users on your site longer, reducing bounce rate and increasing your potential for a conversion (and isn’t that what it’s all about?).</p> \n<p>When linking to any pages on your website, or even outside sources, use natural language for your anchor text. Avoid using spammy or generic text such as “top-rated cheap laptops” or “click here.”</p> \n<p>Instead, use descriptive keywords that give readers a sense of what they will find when they click on the hyperlink, such as a <a href=\"http://hubs.ly/H05xGXn0\">search engine optimization guide</a>.</p> \n<p>Never force feed links to your top webpages, featured products or discounted items. These types of links will only turn off readers and could lead to search engines penalizing your website.</p> \n<p>A word of caution: don’t overdo your internal linking or any linking. We know it’s tempting to link to all of your blogs and webpages, but only choose the ones that best enhance the point or insight you’re writing about in any particular blog. Always think about whether or not these links naturally tie in with the subject matter and if they will offer significant value to your readers.</p> \n<h3>12. Optimize pictures for the fastest possible page speed.</h3> \n<p>Google <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/google-page-speed\">rewards pages with faster page speed </a>and places those that lag lower on its rankings. So, it's important to make sure your page-load times are as quick as possible.</p> \n<p>One of the leading culprits of page lag is <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/google-page-speed\">large photos</a>. If the photo you uploaded is too big, it will make the page take a longer time to load -- even if the image <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/google-page-speed\">doesn't seem huge on screen</a>. Luckily, you can keep your posts visually interesting without sacrificing crucial speed.</p> \n<p>Once you pick a photo, use a free compression software, like Squoosh.app to make it as small as it can go before it loses any quality. Any removal of excess photo data will speed up loading times so readers won't have to wait.</p> \n<p>If you suspect that your SEO issues are related to low page speeds, Google offers a free tool that can score your page and give you suggestions for speed improvement. Here's <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/google-page-speed\">a guide on how to use it and boost your score</a>.</p> \n<h3>7. Preform link building strategies.</h3> \n<p>Traffic from places other than Google is <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/link-building-software\">crucial to your search rankings</a>. Why? Think of search results like a competition where the winners get the most votes. Each webpage that links back to you is considered a \"vote\" for your website, which makes your content more trustworthy in the eyes of Google. In turn, this will make you rise farther up on search results.</p> \n<p>So, it's good to write posts that other websites or publications will want to hyperlink within their own posts. You can also write posts on other business' websites that link back to your website in some way.</p> \n<p>To make your website's blogpost more linkable, include valuable assets or information, such as your own data, original thoughts, infographics, definitions, or other facts that people might not find anywhere else.</p> \n<p>Here's an example of how this mindset could help you. If you write a post titled \"How to Make a Video Tutorial,\" or \"13 Stats about Video Tutorials,\" bigger sites that are writing about something similar might hyperlink words like \"video tutorials\" or \"research from [Your Company Name]\" to your post so they can give their reader more context without repeating your work.</p> \n<p>Once you've written the post, you might want to start sending it to other publications or websites that might want to discuss it or link it to their other posts. This outreach lets other publications know of the post and might also help you grow link building alliances with them in the future.</p> \n<p>You can also consider doing promotion, such as interviews or guest posts that link to your website's blog post to further encourage link building.</p> \n<p>These strategies can be key to your SEO success, but they can be time consuming. To help you, consider trying out <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/link-building-software?utm_campaign=Marketing%20Blog%20-%20Daily%20Emails&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email\">one of these softwares</a>.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>How to Title Blog Posts for SEO</h2> \n<p>Even with a great, SEO-friendly post body, a bad title could hurt you in search engines. To title your post with SEO in mind, draft a clear understandable title that both shows the reader what they're about to read and integrates the keywords you identified in the first step. As mentioned above, write something that pleases Google's ranking algorithms, but is also understandable and enticing to humans.</p> \n<p>Here are a few examples:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>If you're a beauty blogger and you see that people are searching \"how to wear matte lipstick,\" your post could be titled, \"How to Wear Matte Lipstick: A 5-Step Guide.\"</li> \n <li>On the other hand, if your blog covers artificial intelligence and you see that people are searching a new AI app, you could write a blog post called \"How to Use [Insert AI App Name],\" or \"We Tried the New [Insert App Name] App: Here's What Happened\"</li> \n <li>If you blog about farming or sustainability and find out that \"what to buy at farm stands\" is a regular search, you might write a listicle titled \"What to Buy at Farm Stands This Summer.\"</li> \n</ul> \n<p>You know how to write content audiences will love. Now, it's time to write for what Google loves. SEO only heightens the chance of your post getting seen by the right audiences, expanding your reach.</p> \n<p>It can sound tricky at first, writing for two audiences, but just remember these takeaways: keywords, snippets, and descriptions. Learning a new language takes time, but luckily, your blogging software can likely remind you of these SEO tips.

But we won’t be covering <i>everything</i> about communication in this guide.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Communication%20Plan%20Template,%20Blog%20Image.jpg?width=1500&amp;name=Communication%20Plan%20Template,%20Blog%20Image.jpg\" alt=\"free editable Communication Plan Template\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<p>Below, you’ll be reading about communication as it applies <strong>to the workplace</strong> and <strong>to your customers</strong> — two pretty important topics, right?</p> \n<p>We’ll also be sharing ways to improve your communication and learn how your colleagues and customers communicate, too.</p> \n<p>Keep reading to get started, or use the chapter links below to jump around.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>In simpler terms, communication is said to be the “creation and exchange of meaning.” Communication is also a process … a series of actions. It’s not a single phenomenon, and it varies based on method, channel, and person.</p> \n<p>As a partner, friend, coworker, boss, and brand, you have a responsibility to learn how to <i>best</i> communicate. Let’s talk about how to communicate effectively.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>How to Communicate Effectively</h2> \n<p>Not all communication is good communication. In fact, not communicating at all is better (in some circumstances) than communicating poorly.</p> \n<p>Not adhering to effective communication practices can exacerbate or worsen a communicative environment, break trust, and make messages harder to receive.</p> \n<h3>Effective Communication Skills</h3> \n<p>Effective communication isn’t just speaking clearly and honestly. It also involves creating a safe, comfortable space for communication — even if you’re not the one talking. Employ these effective communication skills to give and receive information successfully.</p> \n<h4>1. Listening Actively</h4> \n<p>Effective communication is less about talking and more about listening. Active listening isn’t just hearing what the other person has to say; it also involves understanding their emotions and point-of-view.</p> \n<p>The goal of effective communication is to empathize and understand the person or party with whom you’re communicating. Here’s how:</p> \n<ul> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Focus on the other person</strong>. Don’t look at your phone, look around the room, or begin speaking to someone else. You can’t pick up on voice inflection or nonverbal cues if you’re not paying attention.</li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Show interest</strong> in what the other person is saying by nodding your head or saying “yes.”</li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Try not to judge</strong> or assume as the other person speaks. We talk more about these barriers <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/communication#barriers\">in the next section</a>.</li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Ask questions</strong> and provide reinforcing feedback, such as “What I’m hearing is…” or “Is this what you mean?”</li> \n</ul> \n<p>When you practice active, engaged listening, you becoming fully in-sync with what the other person is saying and feeling. That’s the point of effective communication.</p> \n<h4>2. Asserting Yourself</h4> \n<p>Being assertive means considering your thoughts, opinions, and feelings and communicating them in a clear, respectful way. It doesn’t mean being demeaning or aggressive. (We talk more about the different communication styles in <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/communication#styles\">the next section</a>.)</p> \n<p>Asserting yourself can help you stay clear on your own goals while empathizing with others. Here’s how:</p> \n<ul> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Get clear on your own values</strong> and opinions before you engage with someone else so that you don’t get confused or change your mind to make a conversation easier.</li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Positively express negative thoughts</strong> or opinions. Try to avoid outright anger or demeaning language or attitudes.</li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Be comfortable</strong> enough to say “no” or “I don’t agree.”</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Although effective communication is about understanding the other person, it doesn’t mean we should forget about our own perspectives.</p> \n<h4>3. Minimizing Stress and Communication Barriers</h4> \n<p>Whether you’re speaking or listening, minimizing stress in communication helps create a healthy, effective environment. Here’s how:</p> \n<ul> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Stall or pause</strong> to collect your thoughts. This can help you avoid outbursts or speaking before you think … and saying something you might regret.</li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Make one point</strong> at a time so that you or the other person don’t get confused or overwhelmed.</li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Don’t interrupt</strong> or make unnecessary comments or noises while the other person is speaking.</li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Try to stay objective and upbeat</strong> as you speak and listen. Keep the mood and tempo of the conversation elevated.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>It’s also important to recognize and remove any communication barriers like the ones we describe below. Anyone with a perceived “upper hand” in a relationship — like managers, executives, or parents — should especially keep these in mind.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>Common Barriers to Communication</h3> \n<p>Here are a handful of common communication barriers that may be hindering communication in your relationships. I’ve also included an example of how these might apply in the workplace.</p> \n<h4>Language/Cultural Communication Barriers</h4> \n<p>Language or cultural barriers occur when two parties don’t speak the same language or perhaps have different understandings of the same language.</p> \n<p><strong>Example</strong>: An international intern is shirking his duties to coworkers. The team lead gives feedback by saying “You’re passing the buck.” The intern doesn’t understand the jargon. He isn’t sure how to improve in his role and continues making his mistake, further frustrating the team and team lead.</p> \n<p>Today’s workplace environments are more diverse than ever, meaning collaboration happens among all kinds of cultures. The best way to remove cultural or language barriers is by choosing common, clear phrases that are universally understood. If you’re speaking with someone who speaks a different language, try to use a translator or a verified translation tool.</p> \n<h4>Psychological / Attitudinal Communication Barriers</h4> \n<p>Psychological barriers happen when one or both parties carry cultural assumptions or are restricted by emotional hurdles or taboos. They also happen when there’s a lack of trust, attention, or empathy.</p> \n<p><strong>Example</strong>: A female employee is returning from maternity leave and needs a place to pump breast milk. In her previous job, her male manager wasn’t accommodating to her needs as a new mother, so when she approaches her current male superior with her request, she’s defensive and nervous … thus creating a tense, tough conversation.</p> \n<p>In this specific case, if the male superior was aware of her previous experience, he’d be able to inject more empathy and patience to make the employee more comfortable. Otherwise he might be uncomfortable with her defensiveness. While the female employee can’t help her previous experience, she could try to approach the new manager without any assumptions.</p> \n<p>Everyone’s mind is different, as is their upbringing. When it comes to psychological and attitudinal barriers, the responsibility falls on both parties to set aside expectations and prejudices and prioritize empathy, patience, and understanding.</p> \n<h4>Physical Communication Barriers</h4> \n<p>Physical barriers refer to anything that physically stands in the way of clear communication. These barriers typically exist through email, social media, text, or phone communication (anything that isn’t face-to-face) or when hearing or speaking handicaps are present.</p> \n<p><strong>Example</strong>: A remote employee is awaiting important feedback on a new project. His superior replies, via email, in a way that could be construed as cold or harsh — even though she was quite happy with the results. The remote employee assumes she’s unhappy with the project and loses confidence in his ideas and progress.</p> \n<p>In today’s world, digital and text-based communication is very common, especially with remote work.</p> \n<p>Receivers can avoid these barriers by not assuming the meaning behind a message or by simply asking for clarification. Also, senders can make their messages easier to receive by adding clarifying punctuation or words when communicating nonverbally.</p> \n<p>Lastly, always be aware of personal handicaps with which others might be dealing.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>The Four Communication Styles</h2> \n<p>Personality tests, like DiSC and Myers-Briggs, help others better understand your needs, strengths, and weaknesses.</p> \n<p>The same goes for communication styles. Understanding the different styles below gives you a better understanding of how and why others communicate the way they do.</p> \n<h3>Passive Communication Style</h3> \n<p>Passive communicators act indifferent and often yield to others. On the outside, they may seem meek, quiet, or flexible. They likely aren’t good at <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-say-no\">saying \"no”</a> or dealing with conflict, but they’re easy to get along with as they typically “go with the flow.”</p> \n<p>Phrases you might hear from passive communicators are:</p> \n<ul> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><i>“It doesn’t matter to me.”</i></li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><i>“This isn’t worth fighting over. Let’s just keep the peace.”</i></li> \n</ul> \n<h3>Aggressive Communication Style</h3> \n<p>Where passive communicators are meek and quiet, aggressive communicators are loud, brash, criticizing, and physically aggressive. Their communication style reverberates through their behavior, volume, and wording. Aggressive communicators issue commands, interrupt, and often talk down to people.</p> \n<p>Phrases you might hear from aggressive communicators are:</p> \n<ul> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><i>“You’re wrong.”</i></li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><i>“This is your fault. Fix it.”</i></li> \n</ul> \n<h3>Passive-Aggressive Communication Style</h3> \n<p>The passive-aggressive style displays a mixture of both. On the surface, this type of communicator might seem passive, but they probably harbor an aggressive side underneath. Behaviorally, they might seem agitated and display facial expressions or nonverbal cues that don’t match what they’re saying.</p> \n<p>Phrases you might hear from passive-aggressive communicators are:</p> \n<ul> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><i>“Whatever, but don’t blame me if the team doesn’t agree.”</i></li> \n</ul> \n<ul> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><i>“That’s fine.”</i> (and then proceeds to do the opposite)</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>Assertive Communication Style</h3> \n<p>Assertive communicators are said to follow the most effective and healthiest communication style. These communicators can express their own needs, opinions, and commands while also considering the needs and opinions of others.</p> \n<p>They typically communicate to reach a compromise or win-win situation, and will often employ “I” statements to take ownership of feelings while still expressing a need or desire.</p> \n<p>Phrases you might hear from assertive communicators are:</p> \n<ul> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><i>“I respect your opinion, but I disagree and here’s why …”</i></li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><i>“I feel frustrated when you miss deadlines.</i></li> \n</ul> \n<p>Understanding your own communication style, as well as your team’s and colleagues’, can be helpful when conversations get tough. It can also alert you to ways in which you can improve your own communication skills and challenge others to do the same.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>The Four Types of Communication</h2> \n<p>Communication isn’t limited to face-to-face speaking conversation; it applies to any exchange of information. Below, we walk through the four main types of communication and how you might see them in the workplace.</p> \n<h3>Verbal Communication</h3> \n<p>This type of communication is exactly what it sounds like: verbal conversation that includes sounds, words, and language. Verbal communication is said to be the most effective way to express emotions, feelings, opinions, and needs. If used correctly, words can help you be very straightforward and concise while leaving little room for question or assumption.</p> \n<p>There are four types of verbal communication.</p> \n<ul> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Intrapersonal</strong>, which is when we communicate to ourselves through our thoughts or out loud.</li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Interpersonal</strong>, which is when we communicate one-on-one with someone else.</li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Small group</strong>, which is when two or more people are involved. Team meetings, small presentations, and press conferences are examples of small group communication.</li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Public</strong>, which is when one person communicates to a large group. Public speeches, company-wide meetings, and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/tv-ad-business\">TV commercials</a> are examples of public communication.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>Nonverbal Communication</h3> \n<p>Nonverbal communication happens when messages are sent and received without words. It typically applies to body language, tone of voice, inflection, facial responses, and other gestures.</p> \n<p>It also includes creative or aesthetic means of communication such as dance, painting, and pottery. (Note: Nonverbal isn’t the same as visual, which is explained below.)</p> \n<p>Some examples of <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/nonverbal-communication-tips\">nonverbal communication</a> include:</p> \n<ul> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Making eye contact (or lack thereof)</li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shaking hands</li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Crossing or uncrossing legs</li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Folding or unfolding arms</li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fidgeting</li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hugging</li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moving eyebrows</li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smiling or frowning</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>Written Communication</h3> \n<p>Written communication is any message sent through written words or text. This form unique because, unlike verbal or nonverbal communication, written communication can be edited and changed before messages are sent.</p> \n<p>Written communication also encompasses components of visual communication when sent through electronic means, such as phones or computers.</p> \n<p>Examples of written communication include memos, emails, letters, reports, articles or blog posts (like this one!), social media posts, and print advertising.</p> \n<h3>Visual Communication</h3> \n<p>Visual communications involves sending and receiving a message with the help of visual aids. While visual communication encompasses some written communication, it mostly refers to symbols, images, and video.</p> \n<p>Movies, TV shows, video, and plays are all visual communication as receivers need to <i>watch</i> them to receive their messages. Icons and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/emojis\">emojis</a> are also considered visual communication. The most common form of visual communication, though, is the internet, which sends us messages using a combination of text, colors, images, symbols, and design.</p> \n<h2>Communication in Business</h2> \n<p>Whether you know it or not, you’re communicating right now by reading this guide. You’re the recipient of this message that I’ve written and transmitted via blog post.</p> \n<p>Communication happens all around us, and it’s especially important in business. Not only are we communicating non-stop with colleagues and teammates, but through <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/marketing-campaigns\">marketing</a>, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/advertising\">advertising</a>, sales, and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service/customer-support\">support</a> efforts, we’re also sending and receiving messages with our customers and consumers.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>Communication in the Workplace</h3> \n<p>This section is about <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/28151/3-tips-for-better-internal-marketing-communication.aspx\">internal communication</a>, meaning communication that happens within the workplace. This communication can refer to conversations with your boss, project collaborations with teammates, or perhaps reading your company’s internal wiki to learn about another team’s updates.</p> \n<p>Regardless, here are some tips on communication in the workplace.</p> \n<h4>Communication as a Manager</h4> \n<p>As a manager or team lead, you’re dealing with a lot, right? Not only do you have your own responsibilities, but you also have to oversee and organize those of your team.</p> \n<p>One of the hardest parts of managing can be figuring out how to systematize and catalog important communications happening within and around your team.</p> \n<p>Building an internal communications strategy can help you manage this. Here’s how.</p> \n<h5><strong>1. Assign a communication medium for specific types of communication.</strong></h5> \n<p>It’s hard to speak up at work. People aren’t always sure who to trust. They also aren’t sure which information will stay private, and which information will come with consequences if shared.</p> \n<p>This is where it’s up to you, as a manager, to create a safe, healthy environment for effective communication. One way to do that is to “assign” specific media or channels for specific types of communication.</p> \n<p>For example, constructive criticism or feedback should take place in-person and privately. Instead of sending random emails or criticizing employees during team-wide meetings, consider scheduling one-on-one feedback sessions every quarter. This reassures your employees that hard conversations will remain private, and it also builds trust by showing your employees that you respect them enough to speak in-person.</p> \n<p>Here are some other types of communication that might need their own medium or channel.</p> \n<ul> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Praise</li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Collaboration or Project Updates</li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Strategies or Processes for Cross-Team Collaboration</li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Concerns or Questions</li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Important Business Updates</li> \n</ul> \n<h5>2. Encourage your team (and other teams) to adhere to these processes.</h5> \n<p>Once you define these communication processes, write them down and share them with your team. Encourage your team — and other teams — to adhere to the processes in respect of themselves and their colleagues.</p> \n<p>Where appropriate, record your communication. This creates a record for others to reference and makes it easier to review and improve your processes … which is the next step.</p> \n<h5>3. Review every six months to see how you can improve.</h5> \n<p>Twice a year or so, survey your team and colleagues to make sure your internal communications strategy is working for everyone. Carve out time to receive feedback from your own employees. Remember, communication is a two-way street.</p> \n<h4>Communication Across Generations and Cultures</h4> \n<p>Whether you’re a brand new employee or a CEO, it’s crucial to understand that <i>we all communicate differently</i>. In the beginning of this guide, we reviewed some common communication barriers, namely cultural barriers.</p> \n<p>The vast diversity of today’s workplaces (something to be celebrated!) means that people of all backgrounds, upbringings, and ages are collaborating. It also means that workplaces will have a myriad of communication styles and preferences.</p> \n<p>Here’s how to prepare and stay aware of those differences.</p> \n<ul> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Educate yourself</strong> on how others communicate. Based on our upbringings and education, we all prefer to receive praise, feedback, and instruction in different ways. Take the time to ask your employees and colleagues how you can best communicate with them.</li> \n</ul> \n<ul> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Define communication</strong> as it applies to <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/global-communication-tips\">each culture</a>. What does silence mean to each employee? How do they prefer to collaborate? What does disagreement look like? How do they like to receive praise? Start the discussion and foster an open environment within your team and company. Stay diligent and work to meet everyone’s preferences.</li> \n</ul> \n<a></a> \n<h3>Communication to the Consumer</h3> \n<p>This section is about external communication, which refers to communication that your business has with consumers and customers.

Here, companies solicit multiple price quotes from various vendors to compare services based on price alone. While an RFP includes a price quote (along with several other specifics), an RFQ does not detail anything other than price.</p> \n<p>As opposed to an RFP, an RFQ is a request for quote or quotation.</p> \n<p>Here’s how to understand the difference:</p> \n<p>While you’re technically receiving a quote in an RFP, you’re also getting information&nbsp;like&nbsp;the action plan,&nbsp;timeline&nbsp;of completion, deliverable schedule, and the list of services provided as well.</p> \n<p>But with an RFQ, you’re only receiving the quote itself for the service or products you’re interested in purchasing.</p> \n<p>In most cases, simply comparing quotes is not enough to see if a potential vendor is&nbsp;the right&nbsp;fit for your company, which is why an RFP is more appropriate in these situations.</p> \n<a></a>\n<a></a> \n<h2>The RFP Process Explained</h2> \n<a></a> \n<p>Before potential bidders can submit their proposals, an RFP must be drafted by the company requesting the work.&nbsp;<i>(P.S. We’ll show you how to do this later in this guide)</i></p> \n<p>This gives potential contractors a better idea of what your company is looking for.</p> \n<p>Once your RFP is sent out, contractors or vendors can review it and submit their best bids to compete for the job.</p> \n<p>In these proposals, vendors generally include the following items:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>An action plan of how they’re going to solve the issue</li> \n <li>A timeline of what you can expect</li> \n <li>Any necessary background information</li> \n <li>How much they expect the entire project to cost</li> \n</ul> \n<p>In certain cases, bidders may come back and say specific components of the RFP need to be adjusted based on their experience in the industry.</p> \n<p>At this point, you can either review their feedback and create a new RFP to adjust for the changes, or you can leave the original as is and keep it in mind while considering the other submitted bids.</p> \n<p>Once you receive all the proposals, it will be almost effortless to compare each one and determine which vendor is the best fit for your company.</p> \n<p>Out of the stack of bidders, you’ll want to narrow this down to a handful of your top three, five, or 10 favorites to consider, depending on how many you receive or are interested in.</p> \n<p>From here, you’ll want to spend time vetting potential vendors further to determine who’s really the ideal fit for the job.</p> \n<p>Some companies may request one more best and final offer from their top vendors after they’ve started this negotiation process to ensure they’re not only getting the right person or company for the job, but at the right price, too.</p> \n<p>While this may sound like an extra step, it’s one that may save you money, time, and headaches down the road.</p> \n<p>But this also leads us to a big question: Is all of this really necessary?</p> \n<p>Can’t you just spend time reviewing two or three vendors on your own?</p> \n<p>As you’ll see next, that route is definitely not in your best interest.</p> \n<a></a>\n<a></a> \n<h2>Why Issue a Request for Proposal?</h2> \n<a></a> \n<p>Let’s briefly compare these two scenarios:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Option #1: Spend time finding the perfect vendor on your own.</li> \n <li>Option #2: Use an RFP to get potential vendors to come to you.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Choose the first route, and you’ll probably use your coworkers, friends, and networking groups to help solicit possible referrals for the job.</p> \n<p>Or you might perform a Google search to check out the top vendors in your area.</p> \n<p>After you review the website of a possible candidate for the job, you’ll craft the perfect message to reach out and learn if they can even help.</p> \n<p>Then, you’ll have to explain the specifics of your project and you may or may not ask them to submit a proposal before deciding to choose them for your project.</p> \n<p>It’s not a complicated process, but did we mention you have to repeat it for every promising referral or vendor you come across?</p> \n<p>Imagine how long that’s going to take!</p> \n<p>Now, what if these potential contractors already knew your project details and they came back with their best plan of action and a formal bid for you to review?</p> \n<p>So instead of having to explain your needs each time, you would simply outline it once, and send it out to the masses.</p> \n<p>And to save you even more time, it would be up to potential contractors — not you — to reach out.</p> \n<p>The RFP route also gives you a sneak peek into each vendor’s real plan of action, not the one they talk you into over the phone or in person.</p> \n<p>Since potential candidates have to submit a formal bid, they’ll need to spend time outlining the solution and really working through the problem at hand.</p> \n<p>And if they don’t, you have an easy way to weed out vendors and cut through the stack of options fairly quickly.</p> \n<p>But, to get to this point, you can’t make this next mistake.</p> \n<h2>Here’s What <em>Not</em> To Do With an RFP</h2> \n<p>If you want to find the right vendor, you need your RFP to be specific.</p> \n<a></a> \n<p>Only asking “yes” or “no” questions&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/34097/the-right-way-to-think-about-your-marketing-software-rfp-sample.aspx\">won’t get you anywhere</a>.</p> \n<p>That’s why you must create specific questions that require thoughtful answers.</p> \n<p>Try to use sentences similar to these:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><i>Can you share an example of how you’ve solved this problem or a similar one for another company? Did you encounter any unforeseen roadblocks? What would you do the same or differently this time?</i></li> \n</ul> \n<ul> \n <li><i>With your proposed redesign, how long would it take a non-tech savvy person to complete the new registration form? How much time do you estimate this could save?</i></li> \n</ul> \n<p>With these tips in mind, you’re ready to draft your first RFP.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>How to Write an RFP</h2> \n<a></a> \n<p>Here’s the basic structure of an RFP and what to include in yours:</p> \n<h3>1. Project Overview</h3> \n<p>Before you go into the specifics of your company, you should give a brief introduction to the project itself so vendors know right away if it’s something worth bidding on.</p> \n<h3>2. Your Company Background</h3> \n<p>This shouldn’t be a long&nbsp;history of your company. Rather, it should give contractors a better idea of what your company does and who you serve as a target market.</p> \n<h3>3. The Goals of Your Project</h3> \n<p>Clearly identify what you hope to accomplish with this project and what you see as a “win” so everyone is on the same page.</p> \n<h3>4. Project Scope</h3> \n<p>The details of the project are essential in an RFP. In the same&nbsp;way&nbsp;you don’t want to use vague questions, a vague project scope won’t help you find the right vendor either.</p> \n<p>Spend time really detailing your project scope so&nbsp;there’s&nbsp;no surprises later on.</p> \n<h3>5. Target Deliverable Schedule</h3> \n<p>Even if your deadlines aren’t super tight, you should still have a target deliverable schedule in mind. This needs to be included in your RFP so potential vendors can properly gauge if they have the resources and bandwidth to complete the job on time.</p> \n<h3>6. Possible Roadblocks</h3> \n<p>Don’t hide your existing or potential issues under the proverbial rug if you want them to disappear. A successful RFP is explicitly clear about any technical issues or possible roadblocks, such as: Are you dealing with custom coding or an outdated platform? Does your team have limited resources?</p> \n<p>By explaining these up front, potential vendors will know exactly what they’re getting into.</p> \n<p>You’ll also naturally weed out contractors who can’t handle the task due to those constraints.</p> \n<p>But you’ll also connect with companies that know how to work around these common issues with skill and finesse.</p> \n<p>Remember, it’s far better to find this out now than after you’ve accepted the bid and started work.</p> \n<h3>7. Budget Constraints</h3> \n<p>It’s also important to be upfront with your budget too. The more you can eliminate surprises, the better for all parties involved.</p> \n<h3>8. What You’re Looking For in Potential Vendors</h3> \n<p>Another way to reduce or eliminate surprises is to explain exactly what you’re looking for in potential contractors.</p> \n<p>All you have to do is outline what matters most to your project (i.e., time, solution, budget, etc.) and show how you’ll be evaluating their proposals based on that.</p> \n<p>We’ll show you how this is done soon, but before we do, there’s one more thing to add here: an RFP cover letter.</p> \n<p>Just like a cover letter for a resume, an RFP cover letter creates a professional image for your brand and sets the tone for prospective vendors. It signals that they should take the proposal and the project seriously.</p> \n<p>The good news is there are a number of tools to make creating RFPs easier and less stressful than you’re imagining.</p> \n<a></a>\n<a></a> \n<h2>Proposal Software Tools to Help You Manage RFPs</h2> \n<a></a> \n<a></a> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/agency/proposal-tools\">In this article</a>, we outlined 10 tools to help you manage and create professional looking proposals in less time.</p> \n<p>For today’s purposes, the following five tools are great places to get started:</p> \n<h3>1. <a href=\"https://www.rfpio.com/\">RFPIO</a></h3> \n<p><span style=\"color: #444444;\">RFPIO Solves the problem of responding to RFPs, from project management to collaboration, to integrating with other software.&nbsp; Their solution includes reporting dashboards, auto-response features, and automated generation of proactive proposals from within your CRM.

It'll help you coordinate better with other stakeholders, not to mention keep all the moving parts straight in your own mind. Here's what it looks like:</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/social-media-calendar-month-view.png?width=669&amp;height=388&amp;name=social-media-calendar-month-view.png\" title=\"social-media-calendar-month-view.png\" width=\"669\" height=\"388\" alt=\"social media content calendar month view with colored cells for each content type\" /></p> \n<p>There are three sections to take note of when you edit this template for your own purposes. First, the color-coding key: These are the types of content or campaigns around which you might coordinate, like ebooks, webinars, blog posts, product launches, and so on. Though only some of these might be relevant to you, they're there to indicate what you may want to put in there -- so be sure to edit these categories to align with your own campaigns.</p> \n<p>The other two sections you'll need to edit are the Month and Year at the top of the calendar (duh), as well as the cells below each day of the week. In those cells, you should&nbsp;enter&nbsp;the type of content you'll be promoting that day and color-code it to align with the campaign it's supporting.</p> \n<p>Instead of deleting all the content in this spreadsheet each month, I recommend copying this worksheet twelve times over, and creating a separate sheet for each month. (If that gets to be too overwhelming, you can always save those tabs as a separate file.)</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>Planning Your Twitter Content Calendar</h3> \n<p>Alright, now let's get to the social media content. This section will be the lengthiest, because all subsequent sections will draw on the instructions we go through here. So if you read one section in this whole post, make it&nbsp;this one.</p> \n<p>Let's say you want to add some tweets&nbsp;to your scheduling template.&nbsp;Skip over to the \"Twitter Updates\" tab, where you'll see this:</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/social-media-calendar-twitter-updates.png?width=669&amp;height=296&amp;name=social-media-calendar-twitter-updates.png\" alt=\"Social media calendar template for Twitter content\" title=\"social-media-calendar-twitter-updates.png\" width=\"669\" height=\"296\" /></p> \n<p>The first four columns, \"Day,\" \"Date,\" \"Time,\" and \"Date &amp; Time\" are there for your convenience, and if you choose to use a third-party app for pre-scheduling your tweets (like <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/social-inbox\">HubSpot's Social Inbox</a>), then these columns will be useful.&nbsp;For now, just fill in the date on which you'd like your updates to publish to Twitter, and the time at which you'd like them to go out. The \"Date &amp; Time\" column will automatically change based on what you input in the previous two columns.</p> \n<p>Now, let's move over to the \"Message\" column. Here,&nbsp;input the copy you'd like to appear in your tweet, bearing in mind you should<strong>&nbsp;cap it at 116 characters to allow enough room for a link, and at 115 characters to allow room for an image.</strong>&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/character-limit-social-media-blog-posts\">Read this blog post for a full character count guide</a>.) This spreadsheet will auto-calculate the number of characters you've entered to keep you on-point, turning yellow when you've reached 95 characters, and red when you've reached 116 characters.</p> \n<p>After you've composed your tweet, paste the URL you'd like to include in your tweet in the \"Link\" column. Be sure to <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-are-utm-tracking-codes-ht\">include UTM parameters</a>&nbsp;so&nbsp;you'll know whether all of these tweets are actually driving traffic, leads, and customers. This is an important step to remember if you'd like to be able to demonstrate ROI from social. You can also use the \"Campaign\" column to add an associated campaign, which helps which more robust tracking and reporting.</p> \n<p>Finally, in the \"Image\" column, attach the tweet's image (if you have one). For Twitter, we recommend images that are 1024&nbsp;x 512 pixels. (<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ultimate-guide-social-media-image-dimensions-infographic\">Click here for a full cheat sheet of social media image sizes</a>.) If you're having trouble attaching your image to the spreadsheet, follow these steps:</p> \n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>Step 1:</strong> Right-click the cell in which you'd like your image.</p> \n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click \"Hyperlink,\" then click the \"Document\" button, and finally, click \"Select\" to choose your image.</p> \n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>Step 3:</strong> In the \"Choose a File\" window, select the image from your computer and click \"Open.\"</p> \n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>Step 4:</strong> You'll now see the image attached to the \"Insert Hyperlink\" screen. Feel free to edit the \"Display\" text to change the file name, then click \"OK.\"</p> \n<p><strong>Note:</strong> This process is simply for organizational purposes. If you decide to upload the spreadsheet to your social media publishing&nbsp;software, it will not attach -- you'll have to do that with your marketing software. If you're a HubSpot customer, details for <a href=\"https://knowledge.hubspot.com/social-media-user-guide-v2/how-to-upload-social-media-messages-in-bulk-for-schedule-publishing\">how to bulk upload your Twitter content to Social Inbox</a> can be found within the downloaded template.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>Planning Your Facebook Content Calendar</h3> \n<p>Now, let's talk about how to plan your <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/facebook-marketing\">Facebook marketing</a>&nbsp;in advance with the template. Navigate on over to the tab&nbsp;in your template labeled \"Facebook Updates.\"</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/social-media-calendar-facebook-updates.png?width=669&amp;height=304&amp;name=social-media-calendar-facebook-updates.png\" alt=\"Social media calendar template for Facebook content\" title=\"social-media-calendar-facebook-updates.png\" width=\"669\" height=\"304\" /></p> \n<p>Facebook updates work similarly to Twitter updates, with the exception being bulk uploading your content is not possible in Social Inbox.</p> \n<p>The first three columns, \"Day,\" \"Date,\" and \"Time\" are there for your convenience. Head on over to the column labeled \"Message\" and input&nbsp;the copy you'd like to appear in your status update, corresponding to the days and times you'd like those updates to run.&nbsp;Then, move to the \"Link\" column and input the link you'll be, you know, linking to in the update. (Don't forget <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-are-utm-tracking-codes-ht\">that tracking token</a>.) If you'd like the update to be tagged to a certain campaign, include this in the \"Campaigns\" column. Finally, attach an image just like you did with your Twitter updates -- if you're using one, we suggest you edit it to be 1200 x 900 pixels.&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ultimate-guide-social-media-image-dimensions-infographic\">Click here for a full cheat sheet of social media image sizes</a>.)</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>Planning Your LinkedIn Content Calendar</h3> \n<p>LinkedIn updates are the most unique, because you have both Company Pages and Groups to consider. To demonstrate the difference between Company Page updates and Group updates, let's navigate over to the column labeled \"Title (For Group Discussions Only).\"</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/social-media-calendar-linkedin-updates.png?width=669&amp;height=227&amp;name=social-media-calendar-linkedin-updates.png\" alt=\"Social media calendar template for LinkedIn content\" title=\"social-media-calendar-linkedin-updates.png\" width=\"669\" height=\"227\" /></p> \n<p>LinkedIn Groups let you post a few kinds of updates, one of which is called a \"Discussion.\" You will only fill out the \"Title (For Group Discussions Only)\" column if you're looking to post a Discussion to your LinkedIn Group -- because Discussions are the only update you'll be posting that requires a title. If you're not posting a Discussion to a LinkedIn Group, you don't need to fill out this field, because your update will not have a title.</p> \n<p>You'll fill out the next column, \"Message,\" for every type of update you post, whether it's for a Company Page or a Group. Simply input your copy into this column, and then navigate to the next two columns, \"Link\" and \"Campaign\" to input the URL to which you're directing readers with <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-are-utm-tracking-codes-ht\">the tracking token</a> you'll use to track&nbsp;activity, and the associated campaign if one exists. If you'd like to use an image for an update, attach it per the instructions laid out in the \"Twitter\" section. We recommend editing the image to 700 x 520 pixels.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>Planning Your Instagram Posting Calendar</h3> \n<p>Now, let's move on to&nbsp;how to set up your Instagram&nbsp;photos and videos&nbsp;in advance with the template. Navigate on over to the tab&nbsp;in your template labeled \"Instagram&nbsp;Updates.\"</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/social-media-calendar-instagram-updates.png?width=669&amp;height=187&amp;name=social-media-calendar-instagram-updates.png\" alt=\"Social media calendar template for Instagram content\" title=\"social-media-calendar-instagram-updates.png\" width=\"669\" height=\"187\" /></p> \n<p>Instagram&nbsp;updates work similarly to Facebook&nbsp;updates, in that content can't be uploaded in bulk to&nbsp;Social Inbox&nbsp;like it can with Twitter.</p> \n<p>The first three columns, \"Day,\" \"Date,\" and \"Time\" are there for your convenience. Head on over to the column labeled \"Message,\" and input&nbsp;the copy you'd like to appear in your post's caption, corresponding to the days and times you'd like those updates to run. Keep in mind that although Instagram captions can be up to&nbsp;2,200 characters long, they&nbsp;cut off in users' feeds after three lines of text. The exact length of these three lines depends on the length of your Instagram handle.&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/character-limit-social-media-blog-posts\">Read this blog post for a full character count guide</a>.)</p> \n<p>Next, move to the \"Link for Bio\" column and input whichever link you plan to put in the bio when you publish the accompanying Instagram post. (The reason you'd put a link in your bio and not the photo caption itself is because clickable URLs aren't allowed anywhere except the single \"website\" box in your bio.) Oh, and&nbsp;don't forget <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-are-utm-tracking-codes-ht\">that tracking token</a>.</p> \n<p>If you'd like the update to be tagged to a certain campaign, include this in the \"Campaigns\" column. Finally, attach an image just like you did with your other social media&nbsp;updates -- we suggest you edit it to be 1080 pixels x 1080 pixels.&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ultimate-guide-social-media-image-dimensions-infographic\">Click here for a full cheat sheet of social media image sizes</a>.)</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>Planning Your Pinterest Content Calendar</h3> \n<p>Alright, now let's go over&nbsp;how to set up your Pinterest pins&nbsp;in advance with the template. Navigate on over to the tab&nbsp;in your template labeled \"Pinterest Updates.\"</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/social-media-calendar-pinterest-updates.png?width=669&amp;height=246&amp;name=social-media-calendar-pinterest-updates.png\" alt=\"Social media calendar template for Pinterest content\" title=\"social-media-calendar-pinterest-updates.png\" width=\"669\" height=\"246\" /></p> \n<p>Pinterest&nbsp;updates work similarly to Facebook and Instagram updates, in that content can't be uploaded in bulk to&nbsp;Social Inbox&nbsp;like it can with Twitter.</p> \n<p>The first three columns, \"Day,\" \"Date,\" and \"Time\" are there for your convenience. Go to&nbsp;the column labeled \"Message,\" and input&nbsp;the copy you'd like to appear in your pin's description, corresponding to the days and times you'd like those updates to run. Then, move to the \"Link\" column and input the link you'll be, you know, linking to in the update. (Don't forget <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-are-utm-tracking-codes-ht\">that tracking token</a>.)</p> \n<p>If you'd like the update to be tagged to a certain campaign, include this in the \"Campaigns\" column. Finally, attach an image like you did with your other social media&nbsp;updates -- we suggest you edit it to be&nbsp;735 pixels x 1102 pixels.</p> \n<h3>Content Repository (Or, Where to Source Social Media Content)<strong><br /></strong></h3> \n<p>This template also provides you with a tab&nbsp;called \"Content Repository,\" which should help you keep track of all your content and maintain a healthy backlog of fodder&nbsp;to make sourcing social media content easier.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/social-media-calendar-content-repository.png?width=669&amp;height=146&amp;name=social-media-calendar-content-repository.png\" alt=\"social media content calendar's content repository\" title=\"social-media-calendar-content-repository.png\" width=\"669\" height=\"146\" /></p> \n<p>As you create more assets, you'll likely want to resurface and re-promote those pieces down the line, too.&nbsp;To ensure you don't lose track of all of that content, record it on this tab so you're never at a loss for what to publish on social. If the content you're promoting isn't evergreen, be sure to include an expiration date in the column marked \"Expiration\" so you don't promote it when it's&nbsp;jumped the shark.</p> \n<p>This tab will also help&nbsp;you maintain&nbsp;a healthy balance of content: A mix of your own content and others', a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-social-media-popularity\">mix of content formats and types</a>, and mix of lead generation content vs. MQL-generating content vs. traffic-friendly content.</p> \n<h2>Don't Forget to Interact With Your Followers</h2> \n<p>Whether you use this spreadsheet to plan your content out in advance or upload to a third-party app, you'll still need to supplement these updates with one the fly content. Breaking news hits? Whip up a quick update to share it with your network. Someone in your network tweets something interesting? Give it <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/27675/How-to-Retweet-the-Right-Way-in-4-Easy-Steps.aspx\">a retweet with some commentary</a>. Got a fascinating comment on one of your updates? Respond with a \"thank you\" for their interaction or an additional follow-up comment.</p> \n<p>Coming up with and scheduling your social media content in advance is a huge time-saver, but it should go without saying that you still need to monitor and add to your social presence throughout the day.</p> \n<p>Finally, we encourage you to experiment with your social media publishing. This template provides publishing dates and times for each social network, but you may find those are way too many updates for you to fill, or perhaps too infrequent for your booming social presence. You should adjust your social media publishing frequency as needed.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p><em>Editor's note: This post was originally published in January 2020 and has been updated for comprehensiveness.</em></p> \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fblog%2Ftabid%2F6307%2Fbid%2F33415%2Fthe-social-media-publishing-schedule-every-marketer-needs-template.aspx&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \" />","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 11 Aug 2020 20:30:00 +0000","feedId":924,"bgimg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/social-media-content-calendar-template.jpg#keepProtocol","linkMd5":"92d64e36547482ed94ebef3931c86768","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn80@2020_6/2020/08/16/13-48-27-306_90f03b63de6ed3a2.webp","metaImg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/social-media-content-calendar-template.jpg#keepProtocol","destWidth":598,"destHeight":398,"author":"lkolowich@hubspot.com (Lindsay Kolowich)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/content-calendar-excel-tabs.jpg?width=1362&name=content-calendar-excel-tabs.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn92@2020_6/2020/08/16/13-48-31-571_f90ca5b0d2e1dd8f.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/social-media-calendar-month-view.png?width=669&height=388&name=social-media-calendar-month-view.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn92@2020_6/2020/08/16/13-48-34-285_7d00700896f17a6c.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/social-media-calendar-twitter-updates.png?width=669&height=296&name=social-media-calendar-twitter-updates.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn87@2020_3/2020/08/16/13-48-34-245_ce0511f1fed07ad1.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/social-media-calendar-facebook-updates.png?width=669&height=304&name=social-media-calendar-facebook-updates.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn4@2020_2/2020/08/16/13-48-38-826_07245d8e730a20df.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/social-media-calendar-linkedin-updates.png?width=669&height=227&name=social-media-calendar-linkedin-updates.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn71@2020_5/2020/08/16/13-48-37-665_631c08300d61d1fe.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/social-media-calendar-instagram-updates.png?width=669&height=187&name=social-media-calendar-instagram-updates.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn28@2020_6/2020/08/16/13-48-28-726_04f3c97e99e56140.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/social-media-calendar-pinterest-updates.png?width=669&height=246&name=social-media-calendar-pinterest-updates.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx17/cdn12@2020_6/2020/08/16/13-48-38-282_936d284f402305c8.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/social-media-calendar-content-repository.png?width=669&height=146&name=social-media-calendar-content-repository.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn52@2020_5/2020/08/16/13-48-29-681_89718392f4e99aed.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fblog%2Ftabid%2F6307%2Fbid%2F33415%2Fthe-social-media-publishing-schedule-every-marketer-needs-template.aspx&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn39@2020_3/2020/08/16/13-48-40-114_0003b1a836e6591f.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 21:48:26","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 21:48:26","title":"The Ultimate Guide to Social Media Analytics","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/social-media-analytics","description":"<p>There are over <a href=\"https://wearesocial.com/blog/2020/01/digital-2020-3-8-billion-people-use-social-media\">3.8 billion social media users</a> across the globe.</p> \n<p>As you can probably imagine, that’s a major reason why businesses want to be active on social, too.

But, here are some of the unique <strong>aspects of social media analytics reports</strong> that you can typically customize:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Statistics and data points that matter to you and will be displayed in the report</li> \n <li>Time frame (weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly, campaign start to end)</li> \n <li>Progress growth (i.e. how you’ll share your progress growth over time through a report — typically, either in the form of a snapshot or a comparison of stats in a given time period).</li> \n</ul> \n<p><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/social-media-roi-monthly-report?hubs_post-cta=pillar_allphrase&amp;_ga=2.202530578.2097981921.1583513905-1675356138.1572978608\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Learn how to create impactful monthly reports to show ROI on your social media efforts.</a></p> \n<p>As stated, your reports will be unique based on the analytics software or tool you use.

Again, you can think of this as your social media analytics strategy.</p> \n<h3>1. Set SMART social media analytics goals.</h3> \n<p>Create and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-write-a-smart-goal-template?_ga=2.81024276.2097981921.1583513905-1675356138.1572978608\">set SMART goals</a> to help you achieve your social media analytics goals. By ensuring your goals are SMART, they’ll be Specific, Measureable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-bound — meaning, you’ll be able to focus your strategy to reach or even exceed your expectations efficiently.</p> \n<p>To begin, ask yourself, “What do I want to learn from my social media analytics?” Then, dive into each part of the SMART goal. Here’s an example of a SMART goal related to your social media analytics strategy for reference.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/how-to-determine-your-smart-marketing-goals?hubs_post-cta=pillar_allphrase&amp;_ga=2.81024276.2097981921.1583513905-1675356138.1572978608\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Use a free template to help you create SMART goals and achieve them</a><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">.</span></p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Specific:</strong> I want to use social media analytics to identify specific data points related to my marketing tactics to determine which posts and campaigns are working best in reaching and engaging our audience members.</li> \n <li><strong>Measurable:</strong> I want to be able to identify some specific data points to accomplish this goal.</li> \n <li><strong>Attainable: </strong>I will work to identify <em>three</em> specific data points to help accomplish this goal.</li> \n <li><strong>Relevant:</strong> These data points will help my team and I measure our success in reaching and engaging our audience members across social media channels as well as identify any gaps or areas for improvement in our social media strategy.</li> \n <li><strong>Time-bound:</strong> I want to identify these specific data points over the course of the next month — this way, in four week’s time, we can begin using them to measure our success in reaching and engaging audience members across social channels and identify gaps and areas for improvement in our social media strategy.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>2. Decide which metrics you’ll and focus on and track.</h3> \n<p>Now it’s time to decide which <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/social-media-metrics-ceos-cares-about?_ga=2.81024276.2097981921.1583513905-1675356138.1572978608\">social media metrics</a> you’re going to track. There are a number of commonly-tracked social media metrics for your consideration. Metrics may vary by social platform as well as which analytics tool you chose. But, here are some all-encompassing metrics applicable to virtually every social channel and analytics tool to get started.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Reach</strong> is the total number of people who have seen your content.</li> \n <li><strong>Engagements</strong> are all interactions including shares, likes, and comments.</li> \n <li><strong>Impressions</strong> are the number of times or content is displayed on someone’s feed.</li> \n <li><strong>Mentions</strong> are the times your business and brand are referenced on social media by audience members or other businesses.</li> \n <li><strong>Social ROI</strong> provides insight into whether the investment you've put into your social media marketing is resulting in an increase or decrease in customers, sales, brand awareness, and customer loyalty.</li> \n <li><strong>Social listening</strong> is when you monitor conversations about your business and brand on social to see what customers and audience members are saying about you.</li> \n <li><strong>Likes</strong> are when an audience member taps (or double taps) on your social content to show they’re a fan of your post.</li> \n <li><strong>Retweets/shares/reposts</strong> are when audience members post the content your business published on their profiles.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>3. Determine which social media analytics tools you’ll use.</h3> \n<p>Next, determine which social media analytics tools you’ll use — <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/social-media-analytics#social-media-analytics-tools\">we covered some popular choices above</a> but you can always review other options through a simple Google search.</p> \n<p>Before making a decision regarding which tool or tools you’ll use, think about the following questions:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Do you want a tool or software to help you manage your social media analytics across multiple channels and platforms (e.g. Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn) or just one (e.g. Twitter)?</li> \n <li>Which metrics did you decide you’re going to track (as we touched on in the above step)?</li> \n <li>What is your budget? Do you need a tool with flexible pricing options and features that you can add to or remove from over time? (To find this information, review the pricing pages like <a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/pricing/\">this page on Sprout Social’s website</a>.)</li> \n <li>Which tools and software options are suited to help you achieve the SMART goals you set? (Check out feature pages for this type of information, like <a href=\"https://www.oktopost.com/platform/social-media-analytics\">this page on Oktopost’s website</a>.)</li> \n <li>Do you want your tool to integrate with the greater software your team uses to run your business (such as <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/crm?_ga=2.81024276.2097981921.1583513905-1675356138.1572978608\">HubSpot’s CRM</a>, for example)?</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>4. Measure the success of your social media analytics efforts.</h3> \n<p>Once you implement your social media analytics software, you’ll be able to measure the success of your efforts. To do this, you may use the analytics tool you implemented — depending on your software, you might have the ability to create customized reports and dashboards or pull the specific details about data points you care most about.</p> \n<p>In addition to applying your tools to help measure your success, you may also consider your answers to the following questions:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Did you achieve your SMART goals?</li> \n <li>Did the metrics you chose to focus on tell a story that’s helpful for your business?</li> \n <li>Did the software or tool you implemented support your business needs?</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>5. Make necessary social media analytics adjustments.</h3> \n<p>Once you measure the success of your social media analytics efforts, you’ll be able to determine whether or not any part of your strategy needs to be changed or updated.</p> \n<p>Maybe you realize one of your data points isn’t providing the level of insight into your marketing efforts across social platforms, so you need to identify a new one to measure. Maybe your software doesn’t allow you to customize cross-channel reports the way you want to, so you need to implement a new tool.

Conduct an audit of your current communications materials.</h3> \n<p>Before sitting down to get rollin' on your plan, you need to first decide where it'll fit into your business. So it's important you complete a \"state of the union\", or an audit of the current climate of communications within your company. This can help you identify any problem areas.</p> \n<p>For instance, let's say you need to create a communications plan for a new product launch. To create your plan, you'll first need to perform an audit to identify gaps in your current marketing approach.</p> \n<p>After performing the audit, you might find there is a major gap in your marketing materials in which you rarely discuss a topic that aligns well with your new product. You'll want to ensure this topic makes it into your communications plan.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>To conduct an audit, you'll need to carefully gather and interpret data on your current marketing plan performance and build a path forward based on those results. Additionally, you might consider <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-run-a-focus-group\">hosting focus groups</a> or sending surveys to your audience to find gaps in your current communications materials.</p> \n<p>Of course, you'll want to have the <i>goal </i>of your communications plan in-mind when conducting an audit. In the example above, noticing you're lacking material on a certain subject only matters if your goal is to drive leads and conversions to a product that aligns with that subject.</p> \n<p>For instance, if you're launching a new email marketing tool and you notice you're lacking content on Google Ads, this might not be relevant information for your communications plan. However, if you're missing content on email marketing best practices, that's important information you can use to tailor your communications plan appropriately.</p> \n<h3>2. Set SMART goals for your communications plan based on the results from your audit.</h3> \n<p>After your audit, you'll want to lay out a few goals based on the data from the results. What do you want to achieve with this plan?</p> \n<p>When in doubt, remember that your <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-write-a-smart-goal-template\">goals should be SMART</a>: Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-based.</p> \n<p>For instance, if a small agency is writing a communications plan for its client, they might write a goal along these lines: \"We plan to increase employment applications for our client by 25% over the course of one quarter.\"</p> \n<p>Alternatively, perhaps your HR team needs to write a communications plan to pitch designing a new growth matrix for individual contributors who don't want to become managers.</p> \n<p>If that's the case, your HR team will need to identify specific goals they hope to achieve as a result of their plan, even if the results are less quantifiable — for instance, their goal might be to \"increase employee retention rates by 10% over the next year\" or even \"increase employee satisfaction, as indicated by their next NPS scores.\" They'll need to pitch these goals to stakeholders to get leadership on-board.</p> \n<h3>3. Identify the audience to whom you plan to deliver your communications plan.</h3> \n<p>Good communication starts with knowing and understanding your listener. In this case, if a crisis communication plan is for stakeholders, which one(s) are you writing for? Stakeholder examples include employees, investors, customers, local government officials, or media outlets.</p> \n<p>If you're writing for media outlets, a press release detailing your goals is a good idea for that audience. There should be a process for who will speak to the media outlets, an outline of what they will say, and an action plan put in place moving forward.</p> \n<p>Alternatively, if your audience is your employees, you might want to create an up-to-date internal document for employees to refer to, as well as the contact information for the internal DRI if they have follow-up questions.</p> \n<h3>4. Outline and write your plan, keeping your audiences in-mind.</h3> \n<p>When you're ready to outline and write your plan, it's likely easiest if you start with a table or chart to identify the messages you need to promote, to whom you're targeting those messages, and on which channel(s).</p> \n<p>Once you've created a general outline, here's how you'll want to structure your communications plan (feel free to copy these sections into a Table of Contents for your own plan):</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Purpose (what is this communications plan for)</li> \n <li>Escalation Framework (including 'first line of defense' and 'greater response team')</li> \n <li>Roles and responsibilities of each employee</li> \n <li>Do's and Don'ts</li> \n <li>How to maintain an effective response plan</li> \n</ul> \n<p>(If you need help writing a communications plan, download our <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/crisis-management-communication-kit\">free, ready-to-use communications plan templates</a>.)</p> \n<p>When writing your communication plan, work with groups or representatives from your stakeholders to improve accuracy. Strategies should solve for goals or potential risks.</p> \n<p>For instance, if you work for an agency aiming to promote a client's product, a risk might be spending money on paid ads without a guaranteed ROI. To solve for that risk, the agency should detail different steps to ensure the ads are effective before going public.</p> \n<h3>5. Determine the channel(s) on which you need to deliver your messages.</h3> \n<p>The channels you choose to communicate with your audience depends on your message, and to whom you want to deliver that message. For instance, if you're creating a communications plan for internal employees, you might send out your communications plan in a company-wide email, or use in-person team meetings to deliver your message.</p> \n<p>Alternatively, if you're communicating with customers, you might determine it's best to communicate via an email newsletter, or via a press release.</p> \n<p>Of course, the channel(s) you choose will depend on your goals, but it's important as you're writing your communication plan that you keep your distribution methods in-mind.</p> \n<h3>6. Decide which team members are responsible for delivering the message.</h3> \n<p>Once you determine your audience and channel(s) on which you'll deliver your communications plan, figure out the DRI for delivering the message.</p> \n<p>For instance, if your HR team is pitching a new growth matrix to leadership, you might ask your Director of HR to deliver the initial pitch in the first meeting. Once leadership is on-board, you might ask each HR representative to deliver one training session for each internal team to ensure every employee understands what's changing internally, and why.</p> \n<h3>7. Estimate a timeline for how long each step should take.</h3> \n<p>You should have a ballpark estimate of how much time each step in executing your strategy will take. For instance, if your plan needs to go from the higher-ups down to the employees, it's good to take into account how long going through the chain of command will take. It's also smart to infer how long a media cycle will last.</p> \n<p>For instance, for a minor slip-up on an ad campaign, the advertising agency might estimate the cycle for controlling the issue will take a month — including meeting with the client, stakeholders, and employees to discuss steps moving forward.</p> \n<h3>8. Measure the results of your plan after presenting to stakeholders, and determine successes and areas for improvement.</h3> \n<p>There's always room for improvement. Measure the results of the plan after presenting it to stakeholders, and determine aspects that went well, and areas for improvement next time.</p> \n<p>For instance, the ad agency might not have met its goal of increasing prospective applications by 25% within a quarter. They might rework their goals to give themselves more time or pivot their quarterly focus to fit those goals.</p> \n<p>Alternatively, if you notice certain language in your communications plan evoked a level of stress or fear with internal stakeholders, consider how you can re-word next time to ensure your communications plan feels helpful, beneficial, and positive.</p> \n<p>Some aspects of building a communication plan can be a \"choose your own adventure\" journey. The key is choosing aspects that best reflect what your business needs in times when effective communication is key. What do your stakeholders need to know, and how are you going to best communicate that?</p> \n<h2><strong>Communication Plan Examples</strong></h2> \n<p>A basic communication plan should include an analysis for the stakeholders you'd respond to and the procedures for what to include in those conversations. You might also include an overview of your business, potential communication challenges, and risk management strategy.</p> \n<p>Bright Hub Project management has an<a href=\"https://www.brighthubpm.com/templates-forms/16931-an-example-communication-plan-for-the-project-manager/\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.brighthubpm.com/templates-forms/16931-an-example-communication-plan-for-the-project-manager/\">example</a> that includes how to put this information — and more — into your communication plan as a project manager.</p> \n<p>This example is great because it details how communication managers write crisis plans and acknowledges that sometimes the busy marketer or project manager does as well.</p> \n<p><strong><img src=\"https://img.bhs4.com/4e/6/4e667fb74fa9198f840f825439aed552286b947c_large.jpg\" alt=\"Communications Plan\" class=\"ezlazyloaded\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></strong></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Source: <a href=\"https://www.brighthubpm.com/templates-forms/16931-an-example-communication-plan-for-the-project-manager/\">Bright Hub</a></span></strong></p> \n<p>The National School Public Relations Association has a free<a href=\"https://www.nspra.org/files/docs/Sample%20Communication%20Plan.pdf\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.nspra.org/files/docs/Sample%20Communication%20Plan.pdf\">version</a> of a sample communication plan in PDF format.

This lets stakeholders envision decision-making processes.</p> \n<p>Additionally, if you're part of a larger company with a broad stakeholder list, it's okay to split up target audiences for your plan.</p> \n<p>For instance, maybe your audience is more than just \"consumers.\" Split stakeholder groups for easier comprehension and more distinct solutions.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, your communications plan needs to clearly and succinctly provide necessary information to everyone involved in the business decision, product launch, or PR crises.

(Hint: This is <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/blog-search-engine-optimization?_ga=2.261676877.1179602377.1596518655-940436819.1565181751\">search engine optimization</a>, or SEO).</p> \n<p>You may already know about upstream and downstream marketing. When I learned what these two terms meant, I found myself saying, \"<em>Oh, so that's what it's called!</em>\"</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>You’re probably here for the same reason. So, let’s talk about the difference between these two terms and how they work together. Are you ready for a quick introduction to upstream and downstream marketing?</p> \n<h2>Upstream Marketing</h2> \n<p>Upstream marketing is a long-term plan. It allows for marketers to conceptualize a timeline for future releases based on <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service/customer-segmentation?_ga=2.261676877.1179602377.1596518655-940436819.1565181751\">customer segments</a>. To create an upstream marketing plan, start with a section of your audience that you want to focus on in the next year or so.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/upstream%20vs.%20downstream%20marketing,%20explained.png\" alt=\"The definition of upstream marketing.\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n</div> \n<p>Your completed upstream plan should include the following:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Identification of a portion of your audience's problems</li> \n <li>A product or service that will solve those challenges</li> \n <li>A price and competitive edge for campaign assets</li> \n</ul> \n<p>First, identify the challenges your customers are facing. Do this by referring to your <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/buyer-persona-research?_ga=2.261676877.1179602377.1596518655-940436819.1565181751\">buyer persona</a> and researching the current market as well as gathering feedback from current customers.</p> \n<p>For instance, let's say your company offers a CRM and your team decides to use an upstream plan for improving the enterprise-level tier of offerings. The first step is to identify consumers' pain points. After analyzing market and feedback data, you find that enterprise customers want software that will simplify testing campaign assets.</p> \n<p>Enterprise-level customers need sophisticated, scalable software that enables them to analyze campaigns and engagement metrics. You and your team decide that's where your new product is going to come in — it will focus on helping customers analyze campaigns that are impactful.</p> \n<p>You decide on adding an adaptive testing feature to your CRM. It first will allow customers to automatically test web page performance for metrics like <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/choosing-kpis?_ga=2.261676877.1179602377.1596518655-940436819.1565181751\">click-through rate, conversions, and session time</a>. They can use that data to improve the effectiveness of those pages.</p> \n<p>With the challenge and solution figured out, think about how much the tool will cost and how it can be set apart from the market. If you included competitor data in your research process, you can refer to it at this step to strategize your product's market edge.</p> \n<p>This strategy looks similar to deciding on a price. Factor in your customer segment, competitor pricing, and your own pricing model. With this information, you ultimately decide that the tool will be an add-on to your existing enterprise tier, and the marketing edge will be that the service is a complementary update.</p> \n<p>Conceptualizing a product, its price, and its competitive edge sounds like it would happen pretty early on in the marketing process, right? It is, and, in fact, it should be done before considering downstream marketing. Upstream marketing helps companies plan roll-outs by providing a bird's eye view of what can be expected in the long-term.</p> \n<p>Now, you've come up with the who, what, when, where, why, and how. An adaptive testing feature will be added for enterprise-level customers within your company's CRM within the next year. The marketing strategy will focus on its increased value for the enterprise tier.</p> \n<p>With this plan in place, you can solidify a downstream process.</p> \n<h2>Downstream Marketing</h2> \n<p>If upstream marketing is the \"big picture\" planning session, downstream is the game plan. So, for the CRM company, the next step is to come up with a campaign strategy. That process involves downstream marketing.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/upstream%20vs.%20downstream%20marketing,%20explained-1.png\" alt=\"The definition of downstream marketing.\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n</div> \n<p>Downstream marketing is more short-term than upstream marketing. It strategizes marketing campaigns and asks the question, \"<em>What resources can we leverage to make the customer want our product?</em>\"</p> \n<p>Sometimes, downstream is used interchangeably with general marketing practices: Coming up with processes and activities that will effectively communicate the value of a product or service. This isn't wrong.</p> \n<p>Because the upstream process identified the product, its price, and its competitive edge, the downstream method can use this information to produce an informative, engaging campaign.</p> \n<p>Your CRM company, at this point, will now have to decide the framework for your adaptive testing campaign. Think about what social media channels you will leverage, the angle of the promotional video, and offers you may want to draft. Decide how you will communicate the release of your updates to customers and leads.</p> \n<p>For instance, in this step, you may decide to use <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/linkedin-advertising-campaigns?_ga=2.60355693.1179602377.1596518655-940436819.1565181751\">LinkedIn Ads</a>, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/email-marketing-guide?_ga=2.60355693.1179602377.1596518655-940436819.1565181751\">email marketing</a>, and an <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/ab-testing-kit?q=testing&amp;hubs_signup-url=www.hubspot.com%2Fresources&amp;hubs_signup-cta=directories__link&amp;_ga=2.31447807.1792232450.1595858977-940436819.1565181751https://offers.hubspot.com/ab-testing-kit?q=testing&amp;hubs_signup-url=www.hubspot.com%2Fresources&amp;hubs_signup-cta=directories__link&amp;_ga=2.60355693.1179602377.1596518655-940436819.1565181751\">ebook offer</a>. These channels will be used to acquire leads, excite existing customers, and explain how the update adds value to the existing product.</p> \n<h2>Upstream Marketing vs. Downstream Marketing</h2> \n<p>When upstream and downstream work together, the result is a smooth product development cycle that keeps marketing in mind. The two help you build the bones of a campaign at an early stage.</p> \n<p>Let's go back to the CRM company example. You used upstream marketing to come up with a product of value for your existing customers. It helped you to identify its market edge and campaign cycle.</p> \n<p>Then, using downstream marketing, you developed a framework for the overall marketing strategy. You decided which channels would reach enterprise-level customers effectively. You decided how branding will play a part in solidifying the growth of your product, and how to shape messaging that will connect to your audience.</p> \n<p>The two can create focused campaigns because they identify a customer segment, challenge, and benefit to be used for effective messaging. It keeps teams on the same track, even if the upstream ideas have to change.</p> \n<p>For the long-term, what are some of the ways you plan to use both in future planning?</p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fupstream-vs-downstream-marketing&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 05 Aug 2020 08:00:00 +0000","feedId":924,"bgimg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/upstream%20vs.%20downstream%20marketing,%20explained.png","linkMd5":"daf0cc231fde6bd0ef1a6139eb95d95b","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn5@2020_3/2020/08/16/13-48-28-450_dab181428d63d212.webp","author":"Kayla Carmicheal","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/upstream%20vs.%20downstream%20marketing,%20explained.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn95@2020_3/2020/08/16/13-48-36-865_dab181428d63d212.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/upstream%20vs.%20downstream%20marketing,%20explained-1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn7@2020_3/2020/08/16/13-48-29-853_358f340d021cf283.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fupstream-vs-downstream-marketing&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn4@2020_2/2020/08/16/13-48-37-911_f9900ab2026aa8f8.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 21:48:25","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 21:48:25","title":"What is a Business Plan?

But … what exactly <em>is</em> a business plan?</p> \n<p>In this post, we'll explain what a business plan is, list the reasons why you'd need one, and identify different types of business plans.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h2><strong>What is a Business Plan?</strong></h2> \n<p>A business plan is a documented strategy for a business that highlights its goals and its plans for achieving them.</p> \n<p>Business plans outline a company's go-to-market strategy, financial projections, market research, business purpose, and mission. The business plan is also a prominent tool used to secure investors and financing for a business.</p> \n<h2><strong>Business Plan Template</strong></h2> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/bpt-cover-gif-1.gif?width=443&amp;name=bpt-cover-gif-1.gif\" alt=\"bpt-cover-gif-1\" width=\"443\" style=\"width: 443px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">Working on your business plan? Try using <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/business-plan-template\">our Business Plan Template</a>. Pre-filled with the sections a great business plan needs, the template will give aspiring entrepreneurs a feel for what a business plan is, what should be in it, and how it can be used to establish and grow a business from the ground up.</p> \n<h2><strong>Purposes of a Business Plan</strong></h2> \n<p>Chances are, someone drafting a business plan will be doing so for one or more of the following reasons:</p> \n<h3>1. Securing financing from investors.</h3> \n<p>Since its contents revolve around how businesses succeed, break even, and turn a profit, a business plan is primarily used as a tool for sourcing capital. This document is an entrepreneur's way of showing potential investors and/or loaners how their capital will be put to work and how it will help a business thrive.</p> \n<p>All banks, investors, and venture capital firms will want to see a business plan before handing over their money, and investors typically want <a href=\"https://smallbusiness.chron.com/small-business-investors-percentage-forever-73824.html#:~:text=Angel%20investors%20typically%20want%20from,high%20risk%20it%20is%20taking.\">a 20-25% ROI</a> from the capital they invest in a business.</p> \n<p>Therefore, these investors need to know if – and when – they'll be making their money back (and then some). Additionally, they'll want to read about the process and strategy for <em>how</em> the business will reach those financial goals, which is where the context provided by sales, marketing, and operations plans come into play.</p> \n<h3>2. Documenting a company's strategy and goals.</h3> \n<p>A business plan should leave no stone unturned.</p> \n<p>Business plans can span dozens or even hundreds of pages, affording their drafters the opportunity to explain what a business's goals are and how the business will achieve them.</p> \n<blockquote>\n To show potential investors that they've addressed every question and thought through every possible scenario, entrepreneurs should thoroughly explain their marketing, sales, and operations strategies – from acquiring a physical location for the business to explaining a tactical approach for marketing penetration.\n</blockquote> \n<p>These explanations should ultimately lead to a business's break even point supported by a sales forecast and financial projections, with the business plan writer being able to speak to the why behind anything outlined in the plan.</p> \n<h3>3. Legitimizing a business idea.</h3> \n<p>Everyone's got a great idea for a company – until they put pen to paper and realize that it's not exactly feasible.</p> \n<p>The business plan is an aspiring entrepreneur's way to prove that a business idea is actually worth pursuing.</p> \n<p>As entrepreneurs document their go-to-market process, capital needs, and expected return on investment, entrepreneurs likely come across a few hiccups that will make them second guess their strategies and metrics – and that's exactly what the business plan is for.</p> \n<p>It ensures an entrepreneur's ducks are in a row before bring their business idea to the world and reassures the plan's readers that whoever wrote the plan is serious about the idea, having put hours into thinking of the business idea, fleshing out growth tactics, and calculating financial projections.</p> \n<h3>4. Getting an A in your Business class.</h3> \n<p>Speaking from personal experience, there's a chance you're here to get business plan ideas for your Business 101 class project.</p> \n<p>If that's the case, might we suggest checking out this post on <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/business-plan-template\">How to Write a Business Plan</a> – providing a section-by-section guide on creating your plan?</p> \n<h2><strong>Types of Business Plans</strong></h2> \n<h3>1. Startup Business Plan</h3> \n<p>Arguably the most common type of business plan, a startup business plan is used for brand new business ideas. This plan is used to take a business concept and lay the foundation for its eventual success.</p> \n<p>The biggest challenge with the startup business plan is that it requires its writer to completely start from scratch. Startup business plans start with a blank word document, and before they are finished, need to reference existing industry data and explain unique business strategies and go-to-market plans.</p> \n<h3>2. Business Acquisition Plan</h3> \n<p>Investors will still want to see a business plan to acquire funding to purchase an existing business in order to see how its new owner will run the business.</p> \n<p>What will change and what will stay the same under new ownership, and why? Additionally, the business plan should speak to what the current state of the to-be-acquired business is, and why it's up for sale.</p> \n<p>For example, if someone is purchasing a failing business, the business plan should explain why the business is being purchased and what the new owner will do to turn the business around, referencing previous business metrics, sales projections after the acquisition, and a justification for those projections.</p> \n<h3>3. Business Repositioning Plan</h3> \n<p>When a business wants to save itself, reposition its brand, or try something new, some CEOs or owners will want to develop a business repositioning plan.</p> \n<p>This plan should:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Acknowledge the current state of the company.</li> \n <li>State a vision for the future of the company.</li> \n <li>Explain why the business should (or must) be repositioned.</li> \n <li>Outline a process for how the company will adjust.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Companies planning for a business reposition do so – proactively or retroactively – due to a shift in market trends and customer needs. For example, <a href=\"https://www.restaurantbusinessonline.com/financing/pizza-hut-plans-close-hundreds-us-units\">Pizza Hut announced a plan</a> to drastically overhaul its brand last year, as it sees the need to shift from dine-in to delivery – a decision resulting from observing years of industry and company trends and acknowledging the need to reposition itself for the future of its sector.</p> \n<h3>4. Expansion Business Plan</h3> \n<p>Building onto a successful business venture with another location typically requires its own business plan, as the project may require a new location, focus on a new target market, and demand more capital.</p> \n<p>Fortunately, an expansion business plan allows its writers to reference sales, revenue, and successes from any previous location(s). However, as great as a reference as these points can be, it's important to not be <em>too</em> reliant on them, since it's still a new business that could succeed or fail for a myriad of reasons.</p> \n<h2><strong>Getting Started With Your Business Plan</strong></h2> \n<p>At the end of the day, a business plan is simply an explanation of a business idea and why it will be successful. The more detail and thought you put into it, the more successful your plan – and the business it outlines – will be.</p> \n<p>If you need help starting your business plan, download <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/business-plan-template\">Download HubSpot's Free Business Plan Template</a> and fill out the sections to meet your business idea's concept.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fwhat-is-business-plan&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 14 Aug 2020 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":924,"bgimg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/business-plan-Aug-04-2020-04-21-30-57-PM.jpg#keepProtocol","linkMd5":"e7740a89a97811b84df5f3e27b6f4e3a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn35@2020_1/2020/08/16/13-48-27-296_aeb1a6f98cb70d63.webp","metaImg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/business-plan-Aug-04-2020-04-21-30-57-PM.jpg#keepProtocol","author":"AJ Beltis","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/bpt-cover-gif-1.gif?width=443&name=bpt-cover-gif-1.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn4@2020_1/2020/08/16/13-48-28-936_0f9f0df1ada75d87.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fwhat-is-business-plan&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx20/cdn79@2020_4/2020/08/16/13-48-37-643_b4db0abc82431299.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 21:48:26","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 21:48:26","title":"How to Run a SWOT Analysis for Your Business [Template Included]","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/swot-analysis","description":"<p>A SWOT analysis is a useful technique to evaluate a new project or objective your business faces, or your business as a whole.</p>  \n<p>Essentially, a SWOT analysis is a roadmap for how you should move forward with your business, which opportunities you’re missing out on, and which challenges you should tackle.</p> \n<p>It’s an effective method to maximize opportunities while minimizing negative factors associated with a given project or objective.

Here, I’ve created a sample using a simple Google Doc table -- feel free to use the model yourself, or create your own as it suits your needs.</p> \n<h3>Make a SWOT Analysis Table</h3> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/SWOT%20Analysis%20Template,%20Blog%20Image.jpg?width=1500&amp;name=SWOT%20Analysis%20Template,%20Blog%20Image.jpg\" alt=\"free editable SWOT Analysis pdf template\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/market-research-kit?hubs_post-cta=imagesir\">Download a free, editable SWOT Analysis template.</a></p> \n<p>Use the four steps below as a references when filling in your table.</p> \n<p><strong>1. Identify your strengths.</strong></p> \n<p>Let’s say you want to use a SWOT analysis to evaluate your new social media strategy.</p> \n<p>If you’re looking at a new social media program, perhaps you want to evaluate how your brand is perceived by the public -- is it easily recognizable and well-known? Even if it’s not popular with a widespread group, is it well-received by a specific audience in particular?</p> \n<p>Next, think about your process: is it effective, or innovative? Is there good communication between your marketing and sales to ensure both departments use similar vocabulary when discussing your product?</p> \n<p>Finally, evaluate your social media message, and in particular, how it differs from the rest of the industry. I’m willing to bet you can make a lengthy list of some major strengths of your social media strategy over your competitors, so try to dive into your strengths from there.</p> \n<p><strong>2. Identify your weaknesses.</strong></p> \n<p>If you’re examining a new social media strategy, it’s critical to foresee any potential negative factors that could mitigate your success.</p> \n<p>Start by asking yourself these questions: First, if I were a consumer, what would prevent me from buying this product, or engaging with this business? What would make me click away from the screen?</p> \n<p>Second, what do I foresee as the biggest hinderance to my employees’ productivity, or their ability to get the job done efficiently? What derails their social media efforts?</p> \n<p>When identifying weaknesses, consider what areas of your business are the least profitable, where you lack certain resources, or what costs you the most time and money. Take input from employees in different departments, as they’ll likely see weaknesses you hadn’t considered.</p> \n<p><strong>3. Consider your opportunities.</strong></p> \n<p>This is your chance to dream big. What are some opportunities for your social media strategy you hope, but don’t necessarily expect, to reach?</p> \n<p>For instance, maybe you’re hoping your Facebook ads will attract a new, larger demographic. Maybe you’re hoping your YouTube video gets 10,000 views, and increases sales by 10%.</p> \n<p>Whatever the case, it’s important to include potential opportunities in your SWOT analysis. Ask yourself these questions: What technologies do I want my business to use to make it more effective? What new target audience do I want to reach? How can the business stand out more in the current industry? Is there something our customers complain about that we could fix with our social media strategy?</p> \n<p>The opportunities category goes hand-in-hand with the weaknesses category. Once you’ve made a list of weaknesses, it should be easy to create a list of potential opportunities that could arise if you eliminate your weaknesses.</p> \n<p><strong>4. Contemplate your threats. </strong></p> \n<p>It’s likely, especially if you’re prone to worrying, you already have a good list of threats in your head.</p> \n<p>If not, gather your employees and brainstorm: what obstacles might prevent us from reaching our social media goals? What’s going on in the industry, or with our competitors, that might mitigate our success? Is there new technology out there that could conflict with our product?</p> \n<p>Writing down your threats helps you evaluate them objectively. For instance, maybe you list your threats in terms of least and most likely to occur, and divide and conquer each. If one of your biggest threats is your competitor’s popular Instagram account, you could work with your marketing department to create content that showcases your product’s unique features.</p> \n<h2><strong>SWOT Analysis Examples</strong></h2> \n<p>The template above helps get you started on your own SWOT analysis.</p> \n<p>But, if you’re anything like me, it’s not enough to see a template. To fully understand a concept, you need to see how it plays out in the real world.</p> \n<p>Here are two examples of SWOT analyses on major corporations, Apple and Starbucks. The list of strengths and weaknesses is not exhaustive, and I’m sure you could add some yourself, but hopefully, it’s enough to inspire your own SWOT analysis.</p> \n<h3>Apple’s SWOT analysis</h3> \n<p>Here’s how we’d conduct a SWOT analysis on Apple.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202019-10-22%20at%2010.11.17%20AM.png?width=600&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202019-10-22%20at%2010.11.17%20AM.png\" alt=\"SWOT analysis showing Apple's Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">First off, strengths. While Apple has many strengths, let’s identify the top three:</p> \n<ol> \n <li>Brand recognition</li> \n <li>High prices</li> \n <li>Innovative products</li> \n</ol> \n<p>Apple’s brand is undeniably valuable, and was named the <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2017/05/23/apple-heads-the-worlds-most-valuable-brands-of-2017-at-170-billion/#192b9e3f384b\">world’s most valuable brand</a> by Forbes. Since it’s easily recognized, Apple can produce new products and almost ensure a certain degree of success by virtue of the brand name itself.</p> \n<p>This degree of recognition lends itself to Apple’s ability to sell products at extremely high prices. For instance, in 2016, Apple <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2017/05/23/apple-heads-the-worlds-most-valuable-brands-of-2017-at-170-billion/#192b9e3f384b\">sold 78 million iPhones, the average cost of which was $695</a>. In comparison, Samsung sold their smartphones for $500 less. And yet, <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2017/05/23/apple-heads-the-worlds-most-valuable-brands-of-2017-at-170-billion/#7ca54732384b\">92% of the profits in the smartphone category</a> for 2016 went to Apple. Often, people don’t care about price as much as they care about brand recognition.</p> \n<p>Lastly, their innovative products: Apple didn’t earn its reputation for nothing. They create highly innovative products, which are often at the forefront of the industry.</p> \n<p>Next, let’s look at three of Apple’s weaknesses.</p> \n<ol> \n <li>High prices</li> \n <li>Closed ecosystem</li> \n <li>Lack of experimentation</li> \n</ol> \n<p>While the high prices don’t deter Apple’s middle and high class customer-base, they do hinder Apple’s ability to reach a lower-class demographic.</p> \n<p>Apple also suffers from its own exclusivity. Apple controls all its services and products in-house, and while many customers become loyal brand advocates for this reason, it means all burdens fall on Apple employees.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, Apple’s tight control over who distributes their products limit their market reach.</p> \n<p>Lastly, Apple is held to a high standard when it comes to creating and distributing products. Apple’s brand carries a high level of prestige, but that level of recognition inhibits Apple from taking risks and experimenting freely with new products that could fail.</p> \n<p>Now, let’s take a look at opportunities for Apple.</p> \n<p>It’s easy to recognize opportunities for improvement, once you consider Apple’s weaknesses. Here’s a list of three we came up with:</p> \n<ol> \n <li>Expand distribution options</li> \n <li>Create new product lines</li> \n <li>Technological advancement</li> \n</ol> \n<p>One of Apple’s biggest weaknesses is its distribution network, which, in the name of exclusivity, remains relatively small. If Apple expanded its network and enabled third-party businesses to sell its products, it could reach more people globally, while alleviating some of the stress currently put on in-house employees.</p> \n<p>There are also plenty of opportunities for Apple to create new products. Apple could consider creating more affordable products to reach a larger demographic, or spreading out into new industries -- Apple self-driving cars, perhaps?</p> \n<p>Finally, Apple could continue advancing its products’ technology. Apple can take existing products and refine them, ensuring each product offers as many unique features as possible.</p> \n<p>Finally, let’s look at threats to Apple.</p> \n<p>Believe it or not, they do exist.</p> \n<p>Here are three of Apple’s biggest threats:</p> \n<ol> \n <li>Tough competition</li> \n <li>Lawsuits</li> \n <li>International issues</li> \n</ol> \n<p>Apple isn’t the only innovative tech company out there, and it continues to face tough competition from Samsung, Google, and other major forces. Many of Apple’s weaknesses hinder Apple’s ability to compete with the tech corporations that have more freedom to experiment, or that don’t operate in a closed ecosystem.</p> \n<p>A second threat to Apple is lawsuits. Over the last few years, Apple has faced a bunch of lawsuits, particularly between <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/23/16519546/apple-samsung-patent-lawsuit-damages-retrial-october\">Apple and Samsung</a>, and so far it has only <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/6/16614038/apple-samsung-slide-to-unlock-supreme-court-120-million\">won one case</a>. These lawsuits interfere with Apple’s reputable image, and could steer some customers to purchasing elsewhere.</p> \n<p>Finally, Apple needs to improve its reach internationally. It isn’t <a href=\"https://www.androidauthority.com/in-china-the-iphone-is-only-second-best-830776/\">number one in China</a>, and doesn’t have a very positive relationship with the Chinese government. Then, in India, which has one of the largest consumer markets in the world, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/29/why-apple-sells-just-2-point-5-percent-of-indias-smartphones.html\">Apple’s market share is low</a>, and the company has trouble bringing stores to India’s market.</p> \n<p>If Apple can’t compete globally the way Samsung or Google can, it risks falling behind in the industry.</p> \n<h3>Starbucks SWOT Analysis</h3> \n<p>Now that we’ve explored the nuances involved with a SWOT analysis, let’s fill out a SWOT template using Starbucks as an example.</p> \n<p>Here’s how we’d fill out a SWOT template, if we were Starbucks:</p> \n<div>\n <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/market-research-kit?hubs_post-cta=image\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/starbucksswotanalysis.png\" alt=\"Starbucks SWOT Analysis example\"></a>\n</div> \n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/market-research-kit?hubs_post-cta=imagebottom\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Download this Template for Free</span></a>\n</div> \n<h3>Dine-In Thai Restaurant SWOT Analysis</h3> \n<p>Some small-business marketers may have difficulty relating to the SWOT's of big brands like Apple and Starbucks, so here's an example of how a restaurant might visualize each element:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202019-10-22%20at%2010.26.00%20AM.png?width=600&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202019-10-22%20at%2010.26.00%20AM.png\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" alt=\"Dine-in Thai Restaurant SWOT analysis example\">While a Thai or any other restaurant might not be as worried about high-level lawsuits like Apple, the small business might be more worried about competitors or disruptors that might enter the playing field.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>Local Boutique SWOT Analysis</h3> \n<p>In another small-business example, a local boutique might be well known in its neighborhood, but it also might take time to build an online presence or get its products in an online store. Because of this, some of its strengths and opportunities might relate to physical factors while weaknesses and threats might relate to online situations.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202019-10-22%20at%2010.24.40%20AM.png?width=600&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202019-10-22%20at%2010.24.40%20AM.png\" alt=\"Local boutique SWOT analysis example\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<h2>When to Use a SWOT Analysis</h2> \n<p>Ultimately, a SWOT analysis can measure and tackle both big and small challenges, and opportunities, and both big and little strengths and weaknesses.</p> \n<p>While the examples above focus on businesses in general, you can also use a SWOT analysis to evaluate and predict how a singular product will play out in the market.</p> \n<p>Hopefully, our SWOT template will supplement your market research and business analysis, and provide fair insights into how to optimize your products for bigger payoffs, and less hurdles.</p> \n<p><em>Editor's note: This post was originally published in May, 2018 and has been updated for comprehensiveness.</em></p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fswot-analysis&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 07 Aug 2020 19:05:00 +0000","feedId":924,"bgimg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/swotanalysishowto.jpg#keepProtocol","linkMd5":"9f22ef1f9504cd42dddbf2da0dba5e4b","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn52@2020_2/2020/08/16/13-48-27-414_2c6ff155beebac4e.webp","metaImg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/swotanalysishowto.jpg#keepProtocol","author":"Caroline Forsey","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/SWOT%20Analysis%20Template,%20Blog%20Image.jpg?width=1500&name=SWOT%20Analysis%20Template,%20Blog%20Image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx17/cdn68@2020_3/2020/08/16/13-48-36-903_28f7ed392ffa061e.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202019-10-22%20at%2010.11.17%20AM.png?width=600&name=Screen%20Shot%202019-10-22%20at%2010.11.17%20AM.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn88@2020_1/2020/08/16/13-48-38-555_d17ce5537f683cfa.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/starbucksswotanalysis.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn47@2020_1/2020/08/16/13-48-37-537_a268c0f05cb65a0a.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202019-10-22%20at%2010.26.00%20AM.png?width=600&name=Screen%20Shot%202019-10-22%20at%2010.26.00%20AM.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn67@2020_5/2020/08/16/13-48-31-575_e725d410d9523fc7.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202019-10-22%20at%2010.24.40%20AM.png?width=600&name=Screen%20Shot%202019-10-22%20at%2010.24.40%20AM.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn60@2020_5/2020/08/16/13-48-30-777_8e5e600abafa5af5.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fswot-analysis&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn99@2020_6/2020/08/16/13-48-34-331_fb1068d473508007.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 21:48:26","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 21:48:26","title":"Everything You Need to Know About Affiliate Marketing","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/affiliate-marketing-guide","description":"<p>If you’ve ever came across <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/4-Hour-Workweek-Escape-Live-Anywhere/dp/0307465357\">Tim Ferris's iconic book</a> on how to just work four hours per week, you’ve probably dreamed of sipping a Mojito on a beach while your money worked for you in the background.

In fact, affiliate marketing spend is reported to <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/693438/affiliate-marketing-spending/\">increase to $8.2 billion</a> by 2022 — up from $5.4 billion in 2017.</p> \n<p>If you’re looking for a complete guide to affiliate marketing, read more to find out how you can promote products as an affiliate to create an additional source of income.</p> \n<p></p> \n<a></a> \n<p>There are typically four parties involved in affiliate marketing:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Affiliates: </strong>The promoters of the product</li> \n <li><strong>Product creators: </strong>The creators of the product</li> \n <li><strong>Networks: </strong>The networks managing the affiliates</li> \n <li><strong>Consumers: </strong>The end users of the product</li> \n</ul> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202018-12-10%20at%205.00.57%20PM.png?width=1500&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202018-12-10%20at%205.00.57%20PM.png\" alt=\"affiliate marketing model\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 13px;\"><a href=\"https://digitaladsonline.com/\"><em>Image Source</em></a></p> \n<p>You don’t always need a network to become an affiliate, but the other three parties (the affiliates, the product creators, and the consumers) form the core of an affiliate program.</p> \n<h3>Who are the affiliates?</h3> \n<p>An affiliate, also known as a publisher, can be an individual or a company. Typically, these are other bloggers or content creators operating in the industry of the product they are creating.</p> \n<p>They help promote the product or service by creating content like blog posts, videos, or other media.</p> \n<p>They can also promote their content to get transactions by putting up ads, capturing search traffic from SEO, or building an email list.</p> \n<p>When one of their visitors creates a transaction, which could be a purchase or submitting a lead form, the affiliate gets a commission. How much commission is structured depends on the affiliate program terms.</p> \n<h3>Who are the merchants?</h3> \n<p>A merchant, also known as the product creator or advertiser, is typically the creator of the product or services. They offer revenue sharing and commissions to people or other companies (affiliates), which have a significant following on their brand.</p> \n<p>The merchant can be a company like HubSpot, which offers a commission to every affiliate who’s able to get their visitors to make a purchase.</p> \n<p>Or it can be an individual like Pat Flynn, who offers an affiliate program with his podcasts.</p> \n<p>The merchants can be anyone from a solopreneur to a big company, as long as they are willing to pay their affiliates to help them gain a transaction.</p> \n<p>Sometimes the merchant does not even have to be the product creator, as in the case of the <a href=\"https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/\">Amazon Associates Program</a>.</p> \n<h3>Who are the affiliate networks?</h3> \n<p>An affiliate network acts as an intermediary between the merchants and their affiliates. In some cases, a network is not necessary, but some companies choose to work with a network to add a layer of trust.</p> \n<p>The network manages the relationship and provides third-party checks and balances. Third-party checks can be important because they bring down fraud rates.</p> \n<p>Some popular networks include <a href=\"https://www.clickbank.com/\">ClickBank</a> and <a href=\"https://www.shareasale.com/\">ShareASale</a>.</p> \n<p>Some merchants choose to work with an affiliate network because they lack the time or resources to track, report, and manage payments to the affiliates. They might also choose to work with multiple affiliates or publishers within the affiliate network.</p> \n<h3>Who are the consumers?</h3> \n<p>The consumers or customers are the ones who makes the transaction. They are the ones who purchase the product or submit the lead form in order for the affiliate to gain the commission.</p> \n<a></a> \n<p><span style=\"color: #33475b;\"></span></p> \n<p>We'll talk more about <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/affiliate-marketing-guide#get-paid\">getting paid in the next section</a>. In the meantime, here are some common affiliate marketing models:</p> \n<p><strong>Pay-Per-Click (PPC):</strong> The affiliate gets paid for all clicks that were generated, regardless of whether a lead or sale happened. This is fairly rare since all the risk is on the product creator.</p> \n<p><strong>Pay-Per-Lead (PPL)</strong>: The affiliate gets paid for every lead they generated. This could be an online form submission, trial creation, or any pre-purchase. This is a shared risk on both the merchant and the affiliate.</p> \n<p><strong>Pay-Per-Sale (PPS)</strong>: The affiliate gets paid for every sale they generated. This is the most common model since all the risk is on the affiliate.</p> \n<p>Now, let's talk about how to get started with affiliate marketing.</p> \n<a></a> \n<p></p> \n<p>When it comes to affiliate marketing, most people think it's a process of earning a commission by promoting other people’s or company’s products.</p> \n<p>While affiliate marketing can seem straightforward — just find a product you love, promote it, and earn a piece of profit with every sale you make — there are actually a few moving parts you need to a monitor.</p> \n<h3>1. Choose a platform and niche.</h3> \n<p>To be an affiliate, you need to have influence. Establishing a website or blog that specializes in a niche is the best way to establish influence. Whether you focus on finance, personal health, business, or even cats, a niched blog or website will help you gain influence and build an audience.</p> \n<p>Affiliate marketers build audiences through blogs (on <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/wordpress\">WordPress</a> or <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/cms\">HubSpot</a>),&nbsp;via <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-create-email-newsletters-ht\">newsletters</a>, or even on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/youtube-marketing\">YouTube</a> or other social media channels.</p> \n<h3>2. Build an audience.</h3> \n<p>A large, engaged audience is a highly valuable asset for any blog or website. Having people who read, view, and engage with your content can help you make affiliate income.</p> \n<p>The best way to build an audience is to first establish who your target audience is, and you can <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/target-audience\">find your target audience</a> by researching competitors, monitoring your traffic, and conducting first-hand research by talking to subscribers and customers.</p> \n<p>Once you establish this group, grow and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/build-audience-online\">cultivate your loyal online audience</a> through targeted content and emails. Give your audience a reason to read and engage with your content, and they'll find a reason to purchase your recommended products, too.</p> \n<h3>3. Sign up for an affiliate program.</h3> \n<p>The best way to get started with affiliate marketing is by signing up for an affiliate program like the <a href=\"https://affiliate-program.amazon.com\">Amazon Associates</a> or <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/partners/affiliates?utm_source=pillarpage\">HubSpot Affiliate Program</a>. After signing up, you will get an affiliate link that contains a unique ID. You can then use this link in your content.</p> \n<p>There are typically no upfront costs when it comes to joining an affiliate program, but your variable ongoing costs will depend on how you want to promote the products. If you choose to outsource content or run ads, those are costs that will come out of your pocket.</p> \n<h3>4. Choose which products to promote.</h3> \n<p>Choosing the right product to promote, working with the right company, fostering relationships, and updating content are all core essentials of excelling at affiliate marketing.</p> \n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.smartpassiveincome.com/affiliate-marketing-strategies/\">Pat Flynn</a>, one of the pioneers of creating passive income through providing value to his audience, there are two important rules when it comes to affiliate marketing:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Only recommend products as an affiliate that you’re extremely very familiar with. If you are not confident in the product and do not feel it will help people, do not promote it.</li> \n <li>Never tell anyone to directly buy a product. Always recommend products based on your experience and in the context of what you’ve done.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>When it comes to choosing the right products, <a href=\"http://davidgonzalezagency.com/\">David Gonzalez</a> — founder of an affiliate management agency, suggests that you should think about these three components when choosing a product to promote:</p> \n<ol> \n <li><strong>Your audience:</strong> Will the product resonate with them and make them grateful you promoted it?</li> \n <li><strong>Product quality &amp; value: </strong>Would you advocate your best friend buying it?</li> \n <li><strong>Profitability: </strong>Does the offer have highly competitive conversions &amp; payouts?</li> \n</ol> \n<p>After reading these recommendations, do any products come to mind?</p> \n<h3>5. Create remarkable content that promotes your affiliate products.</h3> \n<p>To see the best success with affiliate marketing, you need to create genuine and remarkable content that promotes your chosen products. Write a round-up blog post of your favorite products. Create comparison charts that discuss the merits of similar products. Interview other users and fans of the products to showcase different opinions.</p> \n<p>Regardless of what kind of content you create, ensure it features authentic reviews and mentions of your affiliate products. Avoid discussing and promoting products you haven't used yourself.</p> \n<h3>6. Optimize and track.</h3> \n<p>Whenever your visitor clicks on your unique affiliate link, a cookie is inserted in their browser to track actions.</p> \n<p>When they make a transaction that is a qualified action (could be a sale or lead form submission, depending on the terms of the program), the merchant is able to record this action and attribute it to you as an affiliate so they can make a payout.</p> \n<p>You should track your own affiliate content, too, to see what has performed well and what you can improve and promote. Understanding what content resonates best with your audience will show you what to focus on for future affiliate marketing opportunities.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>7. Get paid.</h3> \n<p>There are different structures when it comes to payout, which varies based on affiliate program terms.</p> \n<p>Commission payouts by the company are usually given on a monthly basis, but this varies depending on the affiliate program terms.</p> \n<p>It could be a weekly payout or a monthly payment for all the leads or sales you've made.</p> \n<p>You'll want to pay attention to the payout structure when choosing an affiliate program to join, which ultimately depends on the goals you have.</p> \n<p>You might want to understand the commission structure of the company or product creator. Are you looking for a commission per sale or commission per lead generated? Are you looking at a recurring commission or a one-off payment?</p> \n<p>Depending on your goals, this will affect which product you choose, how you plan to promote the product as well as how much time &amp; resources you want to invest.</p> \n<p>For instance, if you choose to promote your content via paid ads, then that’s a cost you have to account for. You will have to compare how much you’ve spent to promote each piece of content or to generate each purchase against how much commission you’re getting for each referred sale.</p> \n<p>Or, if you have a blog and website, then you will have to pay for hosting. In this case, this should be a flat fee spread out across all your referred sale.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-plan-template-generator\">Use this marketing plan generator </a>to calculate how much you need to invest to get a basic marketing plan up and running.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3><strong>How much can you make from affiliate programs?</strong></h3> \n<p>You might be wondering, what are established affiliates earnings? (established affiliates are those working full-time.) Well, that varies. I've seen super affiliates <a href=\"https://affise.com/blog/how-much-you-earn-affiliate-marketing/\">earn upwards of $100,000 per month</a>.</p> \n<p>Making money from an affiliate program is more about the profits than the revenue you’re getting.</p> \n<p>An affiliate making $5000/day might be worse off than another affiliate making $500/day with no cash outflow because the former might be spending most of his revenue on paid acquisition.</p> \n<p>At the end of the day, before becoming an affiliate, you have to align your expectations to your earning potential. What kind of industry or niche you operate in, and what kind of work you do depends a lot on how much you want to make.</p> \n<p>If you focus on ads like Adwords or Facebook to promote your affiliate products, how much money you invest is as important (if not more) as how much you make.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>Are you ready to start affiliate marketing?</h2> \n<p>I commonly hear one misconception: <strong>affiliate marketing is dead</strong>.</p> \n<p>It seems like every year in the world of online marketing, people have mentioned some variant of X is dead — SEO, email, mobile, etc.</p> \n<p>The test of time is a pretty good test — if something has stayed around for a while, there’s a better chance of it sticking around for a while.</p> \n<p>Everything evolves, and there are tactics that don’t work the exact same way as they did before. Affiliate marketing, of course, is no exception to that rule.</p> \n<p>Affiliate marketing has evolved from a get-rich-quick scheme into something that requires affiliate to build real trust with their audience in order to reap the rewards of the work that’s been put in.</p> \n<p>At the end of the day, become successful at affiliate marketing requires you to nail down the fundamentals of marketing. Authenticity is hard to fake, especially when it comes to building your own personal brand.</p> \n<p>A brand that promotes products incessantly without any regard for bring real value to its audience will find affiliate marketing to be a short-lived source of income. Choosing the right products to promote, stemming from a true passion for what the product does, forms the basis of all your promotional activities.</p> \n<p>While there are many tactics to scale your promotion, the golden rule of affiliate marketing stays the same: only promote products you love &amp; treat your audience like humans.</p> \n<p>Build your own brand, choose products that you love, create authentic content and you will be on your way to building a real source of passive income.</p> \n<p><em>Editor's note: This post was originally published in December 2018 and has been updated for comprehensiveness.</em></p> \n<p><em></em></p> \n<p><em></em></p> \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Faffiliate-marketing-guide&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \" />","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 04 Aug 2020 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":924,"bgimg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/GettyImages-1166371279.jpg#keepProtocol","linkMd5":"61ae5bd792623f20e17f60d15668167f","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn52@2020_4/2020/08/16/13-48-27-313_002f40c0c2626737.webp","metaImg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/GettyImages-1166371279.jpg#keepProtocol","author":"jwlee@hubspot.com (Justin Lee)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/The%20Ultimate%20Guide%20to%20Affiliate%20Marketing.png?width=1500&name=The%20Ultimate%20Guide%20to%20Affiliate%20Marketing.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn11@2020_1/2020/08/16/13-48-36-347_7a8152b120ebc75d.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202018-12-10%20at%205.00.57%20PM.png?width=1500&name=Screen%20Shot%202018-12-10%20at%205.00.57%20PM.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx20/cdn95@2020_4/2020/08/16/13-48-34-390_9062ed3f073b59f9.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Faffiliate-marketing-guide&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn84@2020_4/2020/08/16/13-48-31-351_7093cdb40ebbdc31.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 21:48:26","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 21:48:26","title":"15 Essential Social Media Marketing Tips From Beginner to Advanced","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/data-backed-social-media-marketing-tips","description":"<p>One of the most humbling experiences as a marketer is putting out that tweet you just <em>knew</em> would be a home run for your audience.</p>  \n<p>We’d like to think of ourselves as being able to come up with A+ <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/resources/courses/social-media\">social media</a> content every day, but the reality is that we're all human. Sometimes, we hit a wall with planning content that aligns with our company and goals.</p> \n<p>If you're just starting out in <a href=\"https://academy.hubspot.com/courses/social-media?utm_source=marketing_blog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=social_media\">social media marketing</a> or are looking for a few tips to get inspiration, we've compiled some helpful knowledge to beef up your accounts — no matter your skill level.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h3>1. Sync posts across all social media accounts.</h3> \n<p>If you're just starting out, it's a good idea to invest in a social media management service like <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/social-inbox\">HubSpot's Social Inbox</a>. This tool can help you schedule posts, monitor mentions, track your social analytics, and keep an eye on all your accounts. Similar tools include <a href=\"https://later.com/\">Later</a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/\"> TweetDeck</a>.</p> \n<p>These apps will also let you sync posts across various accounts. Keeping content synced will ensure you post across all of your platforms and introduce followers with multiple accounts to your brand.</p> \n<h3>2. Republish and update older posts.</h3> \n<p>If you have a backlog of content that's outdated, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/guide-to-updating-republishing-blogging-content-ht\">update and republish it</a> with fresh ideas for SEO. This tactic has the potential to draw in new readers and take less time than continuously pumping out new ideas.</p> \n<p>This can be blog posts, landing pages, and offers that you have on your website. Your social media strategy exists to put your best foot forward by building engagement, and you don't have to start from ground zero.</p> \n<p>In fact, this exact post is an update from 2017, originally posted in 2013. We regularly update posts to ensure our readers are getting fresh content on our blog, social channels, and emails.</p> \n<h3>3. Schedule posts for evenings.</h3> \n<p>Don’t be afraid of weekends either. Scheduling content launches for evenings opens up a door for engagement that isn't cut off by time zone. That way, even if it's 3 AM in your geographic location, your tweet about your new app update reaches audiences around the world.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/hubspotlife/?hl=en\">HubSpot Life</a> is a behind-the-scenes look at HubSpot's culture, posting content from global offices on social media. During what's considered \"off\" hours in the US, HubSpot Life features posts during work hours in other countries, like Paris, Bogota, or Dublin.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202020-08-11%20at%2010.25.49%20AM.png?width=1500&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202020-08-11%20at%2010.25.49%20AM.png\" alt=\"hubspot life instagram\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 13px;\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/hubspotlife/?hl=en\"><em>Image Source</em></a></p> \n<p>This ensures that global audiences are able to get fresh content during their work days, as well.</p> \n<p>When scheduling posts for evenings, avoid content that requires engagement from your team. For instance, an Instagram photo that invites followers to <i> \"Comment below!\"</i> about something might not be the best idea to post at midnight, when you're not able to engage.</p> \n<h3>4. Include hashtags to increase engagement</h3> \n<p>Hashtags are like a golden ticket to increasing your online reach. Common tags like #SocialMedia and #MarketingGoals are great, but try searching for less-used ones like those of bigger brands (such as Adobe's #CreateYourStory), or community-based (#BrightonMA). Those are going to be the ones an active audience is checking out.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Buffer-on-Instagram-bio-example.png?width=1500&amp;name=Buffer-on-Instagram-bio-example.png\" alt=\"buffer on instagram hashtags\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 13px;\"><a href=\"https://www.business2community.com/brandviews/buffer/the-science-behind-the-best-instagram-bios-02246266\"><em>Image Source</em></a></p> \n<p>As well as using existing hashtags, try your hand at creating your own branded hashtags, like <a href=\"https://buffer.com/\"> Buffer</a> did in the example above (#BufferLove). This allows you to track what your followers and customers are saying about your media presence and product.</p> \n<h3>5. Use visuals whenever possible.</h3> \n<p>If you're getting your feet wet with the social media game, it's okay not to invest a fortune into visual content. However, it's always a good idea to include pictures, videos, or graphics in posts whenever you can.</p> \n<p>There are a number of free services, like <a href=\"https://www.canva.com/\"> Canva</a> , to help you edit and create content. <a href=\"https://giphy.com/\"> GIFs</a> are a great way to engage with a younger audience. And never forget the smartphone most likely in your pocket they produce beautiful pictures you can definitely use on socials.</p> \n<p>If you've tried your hand at social media before and feel comfortable branching out, these intermediate tips are for you. They're aimed at easing the process of creating uniform content across your channels while increasing clicks.</p> \n<h3>1. Post multiple times a day.</h3> \n<p>You don't need to post every hour, but one to three times a day keeps your brand fresh in your audience's mind. <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/best-user-generated-content-campaigns\">Reposting user-generated content</a> also counts, so don’t stress about coming up with dozens of new content ideas.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/guide-user-generated-content-ecommerce\"><em>Download this free guide to learn how to leverage user-generated content to improve your conversion rates.</em></a></p> \n<p>If you’re looking for ways to brush up your content marketing, how about incorporating an infographic or eBook into that Facebook post?

Incorporate your brand into your social strategy.</h3> \n<p>Your brand should speak for you. Once you've established your brand, think of ways to blend it into your social media marketing. This can mean adding your logo to posts, including a company hashtag, or highlighting your employees.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/metter%20media%20branding.png?width=1500&amp;name=metter%20media%20branding.png\" alt=\"Metter Media branding example\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 1500px;\" width=\"1500\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 13px;\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/mettermedia/\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>Check out this branding from social media management company, Metter Media. From a quick scroll through their Instagram homepage, you can quickly spot company colors, get a look into their team, and gain an idea of who they represent.</p> \n<h3>3. Engage audiences with interactive content.</h3> \n<p>From Twitter polls to Instagram Q&amp;As, there are many ways to engage your audience and make your company’s content diverse. You can use interactive content to educate your audience about your products or to connect with your audience.</p> \n<p>Think of ways your audience engages with competitors and how you can add your company into the mix. You can even ask your audience what type of content they prefer to see on an Instagram story, like this example below:</p> \n<div> \n <p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/polling%20screenshot-1.png?width=359&amp;name=polling%20screenshot-1.png\" style=\"width: 359px; margin: 0px auto;\" alt=\"Instagram poll example\" width=\"359\"><a href=\"http://instagram.com/frommybowl\"></a></p> \n <p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 13px;\"><a href=\"http://instagram.com/frommybowl\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></p> \n</div> \n<p>The story of this food blogger begins to recap previous recipes with links to corresponding blog posts. To put this in a B2B perspective, say you wanted to boost clicks on previous blog content. You could poll followers, <i> \"Which type of post goes best with your coffee?\" </i> and link to two options in the next parts of your story.</p> \n<h3>4. Invest in more visual content.</h3> \n<p>As you get into the swing of posting on social media, invest more time into visual content. On average, retweets with pictures gain more clicks and views than text-only posts.</p> \n<p>Visual content isn't just restricted to Instagram. Post infographics about your industry on LinkedIn, tweet a funny meme relating to your office culture, or post a video on Facebook taking viewers on a high-speed tour of your office.</p> \n<p>Next up are some advanced tips. These ideas are for social media pros in need of a new direction or options to brighten their feeds.</p> \n<h3>1. Use new app updates to your advantage.</h3> \n<p>Have you tried <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-is-tiktok\"> TikTok</a> or <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/igtv\">IGTV</a> yet? If not, we suggest expanding your strategy to include these channels. After all, you don’t want to miss out on your content having the potential to meet <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/tiktok-hit-1-billion-downloads-surpassing-instagram-in-2018-2019-2\">one billion</a> phones.</p> \n<p>New apps and app updates add to the ability to diversify your brand and keep things fresh. If you're looking to show your company's humorous side, try uploading a little <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/brands-on-tiktok?_ga=2.157622713.2000696366.1572268289-940436819.1565181751\"> dance</a> video on TikTok. If you want to bring that podcast of yours to visual audiences, upload it to IGTV.</p> \n<div>\n <iframe style=\"margin: 0px auto display: block display: block; display: block;\" src=\"https://www.tiktok.com/embed/6720653674525363461\" width=\"340\" height=\"700\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div> \n<h3>2. Invest in influencers to promote your product or service.</h3> \n<p>It's official: young audiences listen to their idols. <a href=\"https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/consumer-insights/youtube-stars-influence/\"> Four in 10</a> millennials trust the products their favorite influencers promote on their social channels, so <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-work-with-influencers\">investing in influencers</a> might be an avenue to look into when trying to generate sales.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/influencer-marketing-guide\"><em>Download our free ultimate guide to getting started with influencer marketing.</em></a></p> \n<p>If you have an audience that's younger, research influencers in your industry and pitch potential partnerships. Or, for a more budget-friendly option, look at how influencers are branding their content — you may be able to incorporate some ideas into your strategy.</p> \n<h3>3. Diversify content on every social media platform.</h3> \n<p>You can update and sync content on your accounts like a pro. Now it's time to make that content unique. Save your high-definition videos for Facebook and meme posts for Twitter.</p> \n<p>When diversifying content, make sure they all relate back to your company's goals and mission. There's no need to post a recipe for falafel on your marketing company's Instagram, but an infographic displaying the 'recipe' for a perfect caption would be a compelling, spot on example.</p> \n<div> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"> \n  <p>If you're a writer, a filmmaker, or really anyone who’s looking for good career advice, check out this thread from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chrismcquarrie?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@chrismcquarrie</a>. 🙌 <a href=\"https://t.co/RRCbxoO8kg\">https://t.co/RRCbxoO8kg</a></p> — LinkedIn (@LinkedIn) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LinkedIn/status/1187391628916510720?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 24, 2019</a>\n </blockquote> \n</div>   \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/linkedin%20diversifying%20content%20example.png\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" alt=\"LinkedIn Facebook post\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 13px;\"><a href=\"http://facebook.com/linkedin\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>On October 24th, LinkedIn highlighted a blog post on Facebook. On the same day, LinkedIn promoted a Twitter thread aimed at aspiring filmmakers. Threads are a Twitter-specific tool aimed at sectioning off long thoughts, while the Facebook post gives LinkedIn more clicks from their Facebook followers.</p> \n<h3>4. Start promotions to build audience growth.</h3> \n<p>Have you run a contest on your Twitter account yet? Totino's does them well.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/totinos%20promotion.png?width=1500&amp;name=totinos%20promotion.png\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" alt=\"Totinos promotion tweet example\" width=\"1500\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 13px;\"><a href=\"http://twitter.com/totinos\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>Don't worry, promotions don't have to be this fancy. Running a promotion can be simple as giving 10% off of your product or service to a lucky winner who retweets. This expands your reach and sparks lead generation among your customers' followers.</p> \n<h3>5. Create timely content that resonates with audiences.</h3> \n<p>As a huge believer in taking advantage in the meme of the moment, creating timely content adds some fun to your channels and can explain the uses of your product in a new way. Memes aren't the only way to accomplish this, seasons are, as well.</p> \n<p>Is it wintertime in your part of the world? Celebrate by snapping a pic of your company's favorite snowy activity and share it to Facebook. Alternatively, #NationalSandwichDay is November 3rd. Popeye's used this holiday to announce the comeback of a recent fan favorite.</p> \n<div> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"> \n  <p>Y’all…the sandwich is back Sunday, November 3rd.

To stay healthy, people aren't walking into stores and restaurants to make purchases anymore. Instead, they're typically making those transactions online.</p> \n<p>Additionally, the convenience of having items delivered to one's home has changed the shopping experience for consumers. People will likely continue to prefer ecommerce even after the global crisis is over.</p> \n<p>The same goes for pick-ups — although it requires the customer to leave their home and take precautions, the process has become streamlined and requires little interaction. Ultimately, retailers will need to note these conveniences and how effectively they have drawn customers. This is a model that will need to be implemented post-crisis.</p> \n<p>To shift to an ecommerce model, companies need to first research <a href=\"https://www.shipbob.com/blog/ecommerce-shipping/\">competitive shipping prices</a> to get the best deals. Customers want more items shipped, and prohibitive shipping costs might be a deal-breaker for some of your customers.</p> \n<p>The existence of a shipping option also means investing in packaging, which means custom branded boxes and packages will become a mainstay for stores. Brands will also need to be aware of the price and quality of their packaging — they will be expected to invest in <a href=\"https://packhelp.com/sustainable-packaging/\">sustainable packaging</a> to make for a safer future.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, shipping and delivery is a major component of ecommerce and can incentivize customers to become long-term advocates of your brand if implemented successfully.</p> \n<h3>2. More Health and Safety Measures</h3> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/The%20Move%20to%20Ecommerce%20How%20Retailers%20Can%20Adapt%20During%20a%20Crisis-1.png\" alt=\"\">\n</div> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<p style=\"font-size: 11px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.worksafebc.com/en/about-us/covid-19-updates/covid-19-returning-safe-operation/retail\" style=\"font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>The world has been looking forward to life after COVID-19, but the reality is that we will be adjusting to life <em>with </em>it.</p> \n<p>The hygiene practices initiated during the lockdown procedures will need to be maintained, especially as more retailers open up.</p> \n<p>Companies need to scout out strategic locations around their stores to add sanitizers. More cleaning crews will need to be brought in regularly to disinfect the premises.</p> \n<p>Social distancing measures may have been relaxed in certain parts of the world, but there will be occasional flare-ups. Retailers should prepare to reduce the number of people allowed within their building sites — which could mean a fluctuation in sales and revenue.</p> \n<p>As we have mentioned, curbside pickups and home deliveries will become the norm, but brands need to ensure that these items are handled with care.</p> \n<p>Current staff members are likely already trained on safety measures, but any new members will need to be on-boarded accordingly. Additionally, businesses will need to work to keep their employees safe within the premises.</p> \n<p>The world has changed and we will be feeling the effects for a while after — preparing for a safer working environment can only benefit a business in the long-run.</p> \n<h3>3. Remote Work</h3> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/The%20Move%20to%20Ecommerce%20How%20Retailers%20Can%20Adapt%20During%20a%20Crisis.png\" alt=\"\">\n</div> \n<p style=\"font-size: 11px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/306695/workers-discovering-affinity-remote-work.aspx\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>Retailers may not be directly impacted by remote work, but their customers will be — and this needs to be factored in when designing the project plan for shifting into ecommerce.</p> \n<p>While stores need their in-store staff to function, a large majority of their customers will <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/remote-work-tips\">continue to work from home</a> for the rest of 2020 and beyond.</p> \n<p>Many companies are also considering making a portion of their staff permanently remote, which will impact how they access retail services like food, clothes, and entertainment.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>4. Diminished Brand Awareness</h3> \n<p>The quarantine period put paid to all theories about brand awareness and loyalty.</p> \n<p>Consumers were so desperate for products that they bought them from whichever brand was available — despite being patrons of other companies for years before.</p> \n<p>And this trend may well continue — the 'get whatever you can' mindset has set in quickly and will be difficult to shake, and the impact on brand awareness will be felt for long after.</p> \n<p>Since the world has had months of needing specific items and grabbing at whatever was available, consumers will find that supporting a single brand isn't always a valuable position for them.</p> \n<p>With so many consumers dipping into multiple brands, retailers will have to work twice as hard to <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/brand-awareness\">spread awareness about their business</a>.</p> \n<p>Companies would do well to adapt their brand awareness activities to highlight their ecommerce efforts — such as more online shopping options, delivery, and pickup services.</p> \n<p>Creating messaging that boosts the business' ecommerce aspects and opportunities will go a long way in attracting audiences, as it is relevant and timely.</p> \n<p>Regular updates about health and safety measures will also reassure customers enough to give them an incentive to visit stores.</p> \n<p>Retailers need to accept that competition will be more fraught than before — keep an eye on the gaps that appear in the market and use those as, and when, they appear.</p> \n<p>Consumers have an abundance of choices — narrow down their focus by highlighting the added value you can give them in your ecommerce communication plans.</p> \n<h3>5. Virtual Experiences</h3> \n<div class=\"hs-embed-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; height: auto; padding: 0; max-width: 560px; max-height: 315px; min-width: 256px; display: block; margin: auto;\">\n <div class=\"hs-embed-content-wrapper\">\n  <div style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 0px;\">\n   <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9pNibZOzslU\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen style=\"position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div> \n<p>With remote work becoming more of a norm across the world, retailers will have to find new ways to create memorable experiences and relationships with customers.</p> \n<p>Since consumers won't be visiting stores as often as they used to pre-pandemic, businesses need to look to online sources to create those experiences.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.wishpond.com/post/115675437303/how-to-get-more-likes-on-instagram\">Social media has become a lifeline</a> for most consumers and this is something that businesses can use to promote their products and services.</p> \n<p>Several companies successfully kept their audiences engaged by hosting live streams on YouTube or Instagram Stories of classes, product demos, and expert interviews.</p> \n<p>The need to remain socially distanced and safe has led to retailers creating online versions of their in-house experiences, such as <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/augmented-reality-retail\">virtual dressing rooms and fittings</a>.</p> \n<p>Businesses can also create AR filters on Instagram and Snapchat for consumers to try on products like makeup and clothes, as well as for gamification.</p> \n<p>The more online a business can be in the future, the better they will be able to engage with their customers.</p> \n<h3>6. Offer Discounts and Gift Cards</h3> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/The%20Move%20to%20Ecommerce%20How%20Retailers%20Can%20Adapt%20During%20a%20Crisis-3.png?width=456&amp;name=The%20Move%20to%20Ecommerce%20How%20Retailers%20Can%20Adapt%20During%20a%20Crisis-3.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 456px;\" width=\"456\">\n</div> \n<p style=\"font-size: 11px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://saveourfaves.org/\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>The pandemic has hit a large contingent of consumers very hard — and this hardship is set to continue.</p> \n<p>Spending ability and disposable income will decrease as a result, which means businesses will have to work twice as hard to incentivize customers to purchase from them.</p> \n<p>Brands should look at a more cohesive <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service/customer-centric\">customer-centric approach</a> to their marketing — giving customers a reason to consistently engage with the brand.</p> \n<p>To mitigate reduced consumer spending, retail brands should offer more discounts, package deals, and special offers.</p> \n<p>Employ incentives to encourage customers to use your ecommerce services — it will act as an advertisement for your virtual platforms, which users are more interested in now.</p> \n<p>Discounts can also help in amplifying sales of underperforming product categories — they look more lucrative with a smaller price tag and will sell better, reducing inventory.</p> \n<p>Gift cards are a great way to assure future business while bringing in immediate revenue.</p> \n<h3>7. Review Supplier Orders</h3> \n<p>There is still so much uncertainty around which items will move quickly that having excess inventory as a restaurant or a retailer could lead to revenue losses in 2020.</p> \n<p>Retailers should be identifying overstocked items in their warehouses. You'll want to determine which items aren't selling well, and order fewer of those.</p> \n<p>Of course, it's important not to be out of stock of popular items, as that will impact sales — there is a delicate balance that has to be reached here.</p> \n<p>An <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/inventory-management\">inventory management system</a> will help to track items in stock and determine which ones are selling out faster than others.</p> \n<p>To ensure inventories aren't full, retailers should work with their suppliers to slow down the production of certain items — if ecommerce sales pick up, production can be increased.</p> \n<p>Also, you'll want to look into setting up longer payment delivery methods for suppliers — this will help companies retain capital and keep the business afloat until more sales are made.</p> \n<h3>8.

A points system that rewards customers for buying improves engagement and repeat sales.</p> \n<p>Another way to improve consumer loyalty is through subscription services.</p> \n<p>Ecommerce subscriptions have been the basis of many successful business models, in a variety of fields, and they can help businesses boost customer loyalty.</p> \n<p>Subscriptions and loyalty programs give brands a database of people to regularly contact to improve sales — for companies that haven't instituted these, 2020 will be the best time to do so.</p> \n<p>The pandemic is changing the way businesses function, but ecommerce is quickly proving to be a safe model of work that companies can adopt.</p> \n<p>Since ecommerce isn't an arena that all companies are familiar with, to prepare for the shift, here are the steps businesses should include in their project scope:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Investing in pickup and delivery services</li> \n <li>Instituting more health and safety measures</li> \n <li>Acknowledging customers' remote working needs</li> \n <li>Adjusting for diminished brand awareness</li> \n <li>Creating more virtual experiences</li> \n <li>Offering discounts and gift cards</li> \n <li>Reviewing supplier orders and inventory management</li> \n <li>Focusing on loyalty marketing and subscription services</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Following these eight steps will help businesses move safely into an ecommerce environment to improve their sales in the future.

Companies with social media pages generally have a theme that relates to the organization. The use of colors, sensory details, and styling all contribute to the overall theme of a page. I, for one, <em>love </em>thematic Instagrams — they're so aesthetically pleasing.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>When the colors, text, and photos all fit, I find myself going through all the content because it's so easy to look at — the same is true for Stories.</p> \n<p>Sometimes, I come across posts that make me think, \"How did this marketer turn a simple content idea into this engaging Instagram Story?\" And, as always, curiosity got the best of me. I had a question, and I was ready to search for the answer.</p> \n<p>Fortunately, I knew exactly who to look to for help. I wanted to know just how social media marketers choose the right pieces to include in Stories, so I turned to the experts. I asked HubSpot's marketers this question and compiled their tips.</p> \n<p>Let's see what they had to say.</p> \n<h3>1. Look for buzzy, trendy content.</h3> \n<p>When choosing content to add to Instagram Stories, HubSpot Audience Growth Writer Pam Bump, asks herself a question: “<em>Is the content buzz-worthy?</em>”</p> \n<p>\"Trend or buzz-worthy content usually relates to a topic, trend, or piece of research that people in my industry are talking about or sharing on social media,\" she says. \"If a topic is already being widely discussed and shared, it might be more engaging as a story on a social platform.\"</p> \n<p>For instance, if you find that a hot topic in your industry is, say, personality tests, and you have a blog post all about them, think about how you can adapt that into a story.</p> \n<p>Check out this example from HubSpot:</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20to%20Adapt%20Your%20Content%20Into%20an%20Instagram%20Story,%20According%20to%20HubSpot%20Marketers-3.png?width=252&amp;name=How%20to%20Adapt%20Your%20Content%20Into%20an%20Instagram%20Story,%20According%20to%20HubSpot%20Marketers-3.png\" alt=\"Example of content broken up in a story.\" width=\"252\" style=\"width: 252px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n</div> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<p>This story corresponds with a post about <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/personality-tests\">free personality tests</a>. It takes the main ideas from the article and uses short, digestible sentences to recap the content. Additionally, the story's following tiles included a few of the options outlined in the blog:</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20to%20Adapt%20Your%20Content%20Into%20an%20Instagram%20Story,%20According%20to%20HubSpot%20Marketers-4.png?width=252&amp;name=How%20to%20Adapt%20Your%20Content%20Into%20an%20Instagram%20Story,%20According%20to%20HubSpot%20Marketers-4.png\" alt=\"Example of reforming content into an Instagram story.\" width=\"252\" style=\"width: 252px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n</div> \n<p>This tile includes a \"<a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/insights/instagram-swipe-up/\">Swipe Up</a>\" function, so audiences can see the post and get details about the test. Remember, the swipe-up tool is a great one to use for backlinking. You can bring new browsers to your website without making them exit the app.</p> \n<p>Sharing buzz-worthy content will throw your company into the conversation and keep the content fresh and topical on your page.</p> \n<h3>2. Choose media that's easy to comprehend.</h3> \n<p>When you want to adapt content, think about what can be split up into small, comprehensive pieces. If an audience member is scrolling through Instagram during their lunch break, it's likely that they're not interested in reading Stories that are full of text.</p> \n<p>\"Odds are, much of your audience is on Instagram looking for quick entertainment during a work break or daily commute,\" notes Kelsey Yamada, one of HubSpot's social media managers. \"This is why my most important tip is to start your story actively rather than passively.\"</p> \n<p>Yamada suggests that, to keep audiences engaged, \"Grab the reader’s attention with an interactive element, interesting fast-fact, a video, or eye-popping graphic. Then, use the following pages of the story to go into depth about the topic.\"</p> \n<p>Let's look at a visual:</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20to%20Adapt%20Your%20Content%20Into%20an%20Instagram%20Story,%20According%20to%20HubSpot%20Marketers-Aug-10-2020-03-07-49-67-AM.png?width=252&amp;name=How%20to%20Adapt%20Your%20Content%20Into%20an%20Instagram%20Story,%20According%20to%20HubSpot%20Marketers-Aug-10-2020-03-07-49-67-AM.png\" width=\"252\" style=\"width: 252px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" alt=\"Example of starting a story interactively.\">\n</div> \n<p>This first tile asks the reader a question to get them thinking. The Story doesn't use much text, and instead, includes an interactive function — the<a href=\"https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/introducing-the-emoji-slider-sticker\"> emoji slider sticker</a>. The next tile gives survey data to add background.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20to%20Adapt%20Your%20Content%20Into%20an%20Instagram%20Story,%20According%20to%20HubSpot%20Marketers-2.png?width=252&amp;name=How%20to%20Adapt%20Your%20Content%20Into%20an%20Instagram%20Story,%20According%20to%20HubSpot%20Marketers-2.png\" alt=\"How to present data in an Instagram Story.\" width=\"252\" style=\"width: 252px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n</div> \n<p>This content is easy for audiences to engage with as a quick brain break from their busy day. It takes data that was previously collected by HubSpot and turns it into a visually appealing guess-and-check for marketers.</p> \n<p>You can use stats, like survey data, for Instagram Stories. Use short questions to engage users right off the bat, then use the following tiles to give them the full story.</p> \n<h3>3. Think about if you can make the story interactive.</h3> \n<p>One question Bump asks herself when choosing content for Stories is, <em>\"Can I make this content interactive?\" </em>For instance, you might have some less-than-glamorous topics covered on your blog or web pages, but take a look at them from a different perspective.</p> \n<p>Bump notes, \"Even a bland topic can be zested up with a quiz or poll. For example, sometimes, when adapting a post with heavy research into an Instagram Story, we’ll format the story like a quiz. Then the last page will offer readers the ability to swipe up to read more about the answers.\"</p> \n<p>For example, this story was adapted from a post about the <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/millennials-vs-gen-z?_ga=2.251058054.1692937882.1597029621-940436819.1565181751\">difference between millennials and Gen Z</a>:</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20to%20Adapt%20Your%20Content%20Into%20an%20Instagram%20Story,%20According%20to%20HubSpot%20Marketers.png?width=252&amp;name=How%20to%20Adapt%20Your%20Content%20Into%20an%20Instagram%20Story,%20According%20to%20HubSpot%20Marketers.png\" alt=\"How to capture audiences with statistical content in an Instagram Story.\" width=\"252\" style=\"width: 252px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n</div> \n<p>It might not be the most exciting topic, but using Instagram Stories can make the content interactive, raising the interest level of audiences. If I were to see this story before the blog post, I would stop in my tracks and ask myself, <em>\"I think I know the difference, but what does HubSpot have to say?\"</em></p> \n<p>Alternatively, if I saw the blog post, I might not want to engage. But this story makes the content fun, gives the value of the post, and brings readers to the content in a new format. If the last tile included a link to the post, you could boost the number of reads.</p> \n<h3>4. Decide if you can make the text sparse and actionable.</h3> \n<p>\"One thing the social media teams I’ve worked with are mindful of are the amount of text and the amount of pages in each story. I’ve seen that more than a paragraph of text on one story page can result in reader fatigue, which, in turn, could cause people to drop out of your story,\" notes Yamada.</p> \n<p>Remember, it's likely that your Instagram audiences are checking their feeds as a quick brain break or a source of entertainment. Bombarding them with text-filled stories will take away from that experience.</p> \n<p>Instead of using a paragraph of text, include bullet points. This will break up text and allow for emojis, stickers, or other content that will make a story visually appealing.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20to%20Adapt%20Your%20Content%20Into%20an%20Instagram%20Story,%20According%20to%20HubSpot%20Marketers-1.png?width=252&amp;name=How%20to%20Adapt%20Your%20Content%20Into%20an%20Instagram%20Story,%20According%20to%20HubSpot%20Marketers-1.png\" alt=\"Example of a story with little text.\" width=\"252\" style=\"width: 252px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n</div> \n<p>\"If you can include a swipe-up with more content, consider a less-is-more approach where you include a quick tip, poll, or quiz related to a topic. Then, encourage the reader to swipe-up to learn more about the topic,\" recommends Yamada. \"If you can’t, but the story is more complex, consider breaking it up into a larger amount of pages.\"</p> \n<h3>5. Experiment, experiment, experiment.</h3> \n<p>What works for HubSpot's socials might not be the case for companies in different industries. So, remember to <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/social-testing?_ga=2.19779768.1692937882.1597029621-940436819.1565181751\">experiment with your content</a> to find what works the best for your audience.</p> \n<p>Bump recalls, \"While you should do research and keep social media manager guidelines in mind as you craft a story strategy, don’t be afraid to try something different. For example, if you have a low drop off rate and most of your audience gets to the end of your Stories, you could experiment with a longer story to see how far they’ll get.\"</p> \n<p>Don't be afraid to think outside of the box. Sometimes, new ideas are the ones that will be the winning ticket to better engagement. That sales metric that you're unsure about sharing? Experiment with it, and see if you can change the wording to make it enjoyable.</p> \n<p>\"Regardless of which experiments you do,\" Bump continues, \"Be sure to start with a hypothesis, know which metrics you’ll be monitoring, and identify what you’ll do if the experiment works or doesn’t work. This will allow you to develop a strong set of learnings around your audience and their behaviors.\"</p> \n<p>As for metrics to look for, Bump recommends looking at story views, impressions, swipe ups, and exits. Outside of the app, analyze overall Instagram traffic, or use a tracking URL. \" If you include a swipe-up to your full web content, use a tracking URL, such as one made with HubSpot or <a href=\"http://bit.ly/\">Bit.ly</a>, as your swipe-up link,\" she says.</p> \n<p>\"A tracking URL will allow you to see how many page views you received from the story. If you have a CMS with an analytics dashboard that can distinguish social media sources, like <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/analytics?_ga=2.19779768.1692937882.1597029621-940436819.1565181751\">HubSpot</a>, you can also see how much traffic your post has coming from Instagram.\"</p> \n<h3>6. Be mindful of story length.</h3> \n<p>We've talked a bit about keeping the audience's attention. The length of your story could impact their engagement. So when you're choosing content, think about how many tiles it would take to convey the message. Can you do this in less than five?</p> \n<p>Yamada says, \"If someone doesn’t get to the end of your story where a swipe-up link is located, they won’t swipe up. So, I try to keep Instagram Stories content within 4-5 pages if it will include a swipe-up.\"</p> \n<p>Remember, in our personality test example, the story had five tiles. At the end of the last tile, there was a link to the corresponding blog post. This captures the reader's attention quickly and backlinks the source before they exit:</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20to%20Adapt%20Your%20Content%20Into%20an%20Instagram%20Story,%20According%20to%20HubSpot%20Marketers-Aug-10-2020-03-07-49-38-AM.png?width=252&amp;name=How%20to%20Adapt%20Your%20Content%20Into%20an%20Instagram%20Story,%20According%20to%20HubSpot%20Marketers-Aug-10-2020-03-07-49-38-AM.png\" alt=\"How to shorten content for an Instagram Story.\" width=\"252\" style=\"width: 252px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n</div> \n<p>\"Do your best to cut the content down to the biggest takeaways. If your audience wants all the details, provide a link to the source material in a swipe-up or in the DMs if anyone reaches out. If a piece of content can't be summarized and cut down, it's not the best fit for Stories,\" Yamada explains.</p> \n<p>In the example above, the content explains a test the audience can take, where they can find it, and how to get more information. Basically, the story is used as a \"preview\" for the rest of the content. Is there content in your arsenal that's similar — like a study you just performed?</p> \n<h3>7. Put yourself in the audience's shoes.</h3> \n<p>Keeping your audience in mind is at the forefront of content creation. Remember to think about their motivation as much as their interests.</p> \n<p>\"Whenever I’ve adapted long-form content into Instagram, Snapchat, or Facebook Stories, I’ve tried to imagine what my audience will be doing and thinking when they aimlessly tap through Stories and come across my brand’s,\" states Yamada.</p> \n<p>Think about how you interact with Stories on Instagram. A story that's short, simple, and includes visual elements probably keeps you more interested than a story that's too busy, with a lot of moving parts. It's jarring to tap to a story and see a huge video with no explanation, right?</p> \n<p>To choose content that your audience will be intrigued by, Bump encourages marketers to \"Think about what your audience likes to see from you on Instagram. If you get a ton of engagement on sales-related content, for example, try adapting a blog post about sales into a short-form story.\"</p> \n<p>As Yamada notes, \"Adapting your existing content into stories will give it the opportunity to provide value on a different platform to a different audience.\" If your audience misses content you want to boost, or you want to present it in a different way, take to your Stories to give it more exposure.</p> \n<p>Adapting your content into stories gives audiences a rounded view of what your brand is about from a different perspective.</p> \n<p>\"Why shouldn't more people see the awesome content you've already worked on creating?\" she asks. \"You'll also find yourself saving time when adapting content, as you won't have to create a whole new piece just for Stories. A win-win!\"</p> \n<p>These tips made me excited to jump into my content and see what I could turn into the next high-performing story. I can't wait to find new data or research that I can make more engaging with a few emojis. Plus, I feel more confident about what I can put out there.

People are increasingly interested in communicating with brands in a more <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/customers/chat-new-hubspot-conversations\">personal, conversational way</a> — and chatbots can help.</p>  \n<p>Including chatbots on your website helps visitors find what they are looking for and connect them with your team in an immediate, frictionless way. Chatbots also follow the Inbound Messaging Framework.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/chatbots-improve-customer-experience-experiment-1.png?width=1500&amp;name=chatbots-improve-customer-experience-experiment-1.png\" alt=\"chatbots inbound messaging framework\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>So, what are the secrets to building a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-build-a-chatbot\">chatbot strategy</a>?</p> \n<p>On HubSpot’s marketing team, we seek to deliver a world-class customer experience. We consistently ask: How can <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/best-ai-chatbot\">chatbots</a> better serve our various audiences (visitors, leads, and customers) to help direct them to the right resources for their needs? Also, how can we use chatbots to support our sales team and reach our goals?</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/crm/chatbot-builder\"><em>Use HubSpot's free Chatbot Builder Software to easily build and launch chatbots on your website — no coding required.</em></a></p> \n<h2>A Customer-Focused Bot Experience</h2> \n<p>Chatbots work when they're contextual and relevant to specific problems folks are having. Through conversations with our sales team, we learned that 15% of chat questions on the website were about getting technical support. We were creating friction for our customers because our sales team (who answers chat questions onsite) is not as well equipped to answer these questions as our <em>support</em> team is.</p> \n<p>So, we created a bot to direct our customers to the right resources for technical support (our support team, knowledgebase, and community). If they were not looking for technical support, we passed their questions about HubSpot features and pricing to our sales team.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/chatbots-improve-customer-experience-experiment-2.png?width=1500&amp;name=chatbots-improve-customer-experience-experiment-2.png\" alt=\"chatbots improve customer experience\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>We rolled out these bots across the primary site pages and saw an <strong>80% increase</strong> in our sales team efficiency: a measure of success based on the number of meetings we booked divided by the total number of chats handled. And, it was a far better customer experience, as our customers could access technical support more easily.</p> \n<p>It was a big win, but our work was hardly done. As we took a step back, we realized that this “support bot” experience was not serving all of our users. About <strong>70% of our audience is visitors and leads</strong>, compared with 30% who are users and customers. This first bot experience was designed with only 30% of our audience in mind. Ignoring 70% of our audience meant we were leaving money on the table.</p> \n<h2>A Personalized Experience for All Visitors</h2> \n<p>We needed to create a personalized experience for the visitor and lead audiences, too.</p> \n<p>With the “support bot” experience, it was odd to ask visitors and leads if they needed support when we knew they weren’t using our tools yet. Rather than directing visitors and leads to chat or support, we wanted to give these visitors their own “self-help” option. Why not give them the option to get started for free with the HubSpot CRM? That way they could start using our free tools or chat with our sales team about features and pricing for advanced tools.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/chatbots-improve-customer-experience-experiment-3-1.png?width=1500&amp;name=chatbots-improve-customer-experience-experiment-3-1.png\" alt=\"hubspot hubbot example\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>Now we had designed <em>two</em> personalized experiences: one for those already using our software (customers) <em>and</em> those who had yet to experience it (visitors).</p> \n<p>We believed this to be a better experience for each audience, because it offered <strong>contextual options based on their relationship with HubSpot</strong>. However, we wanted to test it first with an experiment.</p> \n<h2>Setting Up the Experiment</h2> \n<p>In order to test our hypothesis that this would be a better experience for both of these users, we set up an A/B test on one of our product pages so we could see exactly how the bot for visitors performed against the current bot experience (designed for customers).</p> \n<p>First, we defined our metrics for success. We looked at:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Sales team efficiency: # of meetings booked by our sales team ÷ the number of chats they handled</li> \n <li># of signups for the CRM</li> \n</ul> \n<p>We also compared these for each bot (control vs. variant), and by each audience (visitors vs. customer).</p> \n<p>We chose one of our product pages and directed 50% of its site traffic to a cloned page with the new bot experience. The test was live and ready to run for one month while we waited (somewhat) patiently for the results.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/chatbots-improve-customer-experience-experiment-4.gif?width=480&amp;name=chatbots-improve-customer-experience-experiment-4.gif\" alt=\"chatbots improve customer experience gif\" width=\"480\" style=\"width: 480px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 13px;\"><em>Me, waiting at my desk</em></p> \n<h2>Experiment Results</h2> \n<p>We isolated our results for the audience the test was focused on: visitors. We looked at how the control (support bot) performed against the variant (lead bot).</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Sales team efficiency: increased by almost 70% in the variant</li> \n <li># of CRM signups: increased by 7%</li> \n</ul> \n<p>The increase in CRM signups indicated that visitors were finding the right option for them (starting for free) and diving in to try out our software for free.</p> \n<p>As a result, fewer chats reached our sales team, but we saw a similar number of meetings booked to continue the sales conversation after a chat. This meant a couple of things:</p> \n<ol> \n <li>The sales team was able to spend more time and focus on higher quality chats that were more likely to turn into sales</li> \n <li>We weren’t losing demand, because we still saw a similar number of meetings booked. We were still capturing those interested in having a sales conversation, just in a more efficient way.</li> \n</ol> \n<p><strong>Better segmentation makes life better for everyone.</strong> Making a bot personalized for visitors helped the customers’ bot perform better as well. We learned the customer bot works very well for the audience it was designed for — performing 52% better when shown only to customers than when it was shown to all visitors.</p> \n<h2>Takeaways for Your Business</h2> \n<p>It’s important to recognize that different segments of your audience have different problems and what works for one audience isn't the best for another. By understanding the problems that our visitors are facing, and personalizing their <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/crm/chatbot-builder\">chatbot</a> experience onsite, you can create a better prospect <em>and</em> customer experience. When you anticipate the help that people need better, your metrics will improve as well.</p> \n<p>And you may be thinking, “OK, that sounds pretty good for HubSpot, but what about my business? How can I create a more contextual bot experience for my business?” Here’s how:</p> \n<ol> \n <li>Create a list of the various audiences you are serving on your website.</li> \n <li>For each audience, describe the types of questions they might have.</li> \n <li>Determine the resources or people who can best answer those questions so you can help them find what they are looking for faster and with less friction.</li> \n</ol> \n<p><strong>Then implement it!</strong> The <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/crm/conversations\">HubSpot Conversations tool</a> gives you the ability to target your chat flows with segmented lists based on data in your CRM so you can create a personalized experience as well.</p> \n<p>Chatbots work shoulder-to-shoulder alongside with our sales team to provide an excellent, personalized purchase experience that also helps us identify visitors who are possible good fit customers.</p> \n<p>Chatbots can do the same for your business and audience.</p> \n<p><em>Editor's note: This post was originally published in July 2019 and has been updated for comprehensiveness.</em></p> \n<p></p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fchatbots-improve-customer-experience-experiment&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 05 Aug 2020 11:30:00 +0000","feedId":924,"bgimg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/imageedit_24_6767743391.jpg#keepProtocol","linkMd5":"55f1319403b354f5bfd03f0c32028cbd","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn87@2020_5/2020/08/16/13-48-28-374_a4fdee626f1f6f84.webp","metaImg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/imageedit_24_6767743391.jpg#keepProtocol","author":"aechtwilson@hubspot.com (Ari Echt-Wilson)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/chatbots-improve-customer-experience-experiment-1.png?width=1500&name=chatbots-improve-customer-experience-experiment-1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn55@2020_3/2020/08/16/13-48-31-948_087824bde2b2afbc.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/chatbots-improve-customer-experience-experiment-2.png?width=1500&name=chatbots-improve-customer-experience-experiment-2.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx17/cdn28@2020_1/2020/08/16/13-48-32-239_bbfe3b34eb7f56a4.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/chatbots-improve-customer-experience-experiment-3-1.png?width=1500&name=chatbots-improve-customer-experience-experiment-3-1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn23@2020_6/2020/08/16/13-48-29-697_e6768fa8a751a02c.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/chatbots-improve-customer-experience-experiment-4.gif?width=480&name=chatbots-improve-customer-experience-experiment-4.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn87@2020_6/2020/08/16/13-48-33-638_2db4719445ea8594.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fchatbots-improve-customer-experience-experiment&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn24@2020_6/2020/08/16/13-48-28-574_91610e8525bc2856.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 21:48:26","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 21:48:26","title":"Lights, Camera, Action: How to Record a Webinar Worth Replaying","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/9990/how-to-record-a-webinar.aspx","description":"<p>A few short months ago, I discovered the beauty of webinars.</p>  \n<p>I love to learn more about the marketing industry. Every chance I get, I'm on LinkedIn searching for engaging content that teaches me something new about social media or content creation.</p> \n<p>And my favorite way to learn is by watching a webinar.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>By taking an hour out of my day, I can gain valuable insights from industry experts about virtually any topic. In most cases, I'm introduced to a new thought leader in the space, as well.</p> \n<p>The only downside to webinars is that a lot of them are live events. Most of the time, my schedule doesn't allow for a \"One-time only\" experience, so I miss out on a lot of compelling webinars.</p> \n<p>Fortunately, there's a simple fix around that: Recording them.</p> \n<p>If it sounds like a lot of extra work to record a webinar, edit, <em>and </em>figure out where it'll live post-launch, don't worry. This post will show you how to do it in five easy steps.</p> \n<p>Ready to get started and press \"Record\"?</p> \n<h2>Why record webinars?</h2> \n<p>Webinars are a fantastic addition to your content marketing toolkit. Though they take time to produce, they can be extremely valuable for your audience. They're basically vocal eBooks — They present educational lessons in a fun, engaging format.</p> \n<p>For example, this webinar is a short, insightful discussion about how to manage a remote sales team:</p> \n<div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"width: 100%; height: auto; position: relative; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; max-width: 560px; max-height: 315px; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\"> \n <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 0;\">\n  <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/c4Zl3vos-WA\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n </div> \n</div> \n<p>You might want to consider recording your webinar for a couple of reasons. First, recorded videos can be edited. If this is your first time hosting a webinar, it might be useful to host it with no audience,. so you can make small tweaks.</p> \n<p>Recorded webinars are also useful because they are accessible. If you decide to host yours during a time your audience can't attend, recording the webinar ensures they can still catch the information.</p> \n<p>Regardless of whether you're a webinar pro or a beginner, there's some extra things to keep in mind before you hit that \"Record\" button. Read on to learn more about recording, exporting, and sharing a webinar.</p> \n<h3>1. Choose proper video hosting software.</h3> \n<p>After the plans to record a webinar are set, the next step is choosing a platform. A lot of platforms are similar as far as what they offer, but go with one that will let you record <em>and</em> export. It's a good idea to look for one that will also record for a longer time.</p> \n<p>Some <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/best-screen-recorder?_ga=2.71137424.1276787802.1596678320-940436819.1565181751\">recording tools</a> are only built for certain operating systems, so make sure yours operates on multiple different systems. Most platforms you'll find work on both Mac and Windows devices, but keep a watchful eye as you're researching.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.vidyard.com/\">Vidyard</a> and <a href=\"https://zoom.us/\">Zoom</a> are good places to start. Both offer recording options and are easy to use. You can also record, export, and upload videos from these platforms onto web pages. Alternatively, check to see if your computer comes with recording software, like <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/quicktime\">QuickTime</a> — it's possible you won't have to download a new tool if your computer already comes equipped.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, choose one that will let you do everything you need. If you have to share your screen or ask for audience participation, make sure your software has those capabilities.</p> \n<h3>2. Decide where you will record.</h3> \n<p>The setting or background of your webinar shouldn't be disrupting. If your attention can be taken away by something near you, so can your audience's. Choose a place to record your webinar that's quiet and fit for a professional presentation.</p> \n<p>A quiet space with little outside distraction is going to be your best bet. If that's hard to accomplish, try to change your setting so it's more fit for a webinar. Think about what you want the background to look like in a video that will live past its original recording date.</p> \n<p>For instance, if the space you have includes a bright green poster and some laundry in the background, take the poster down and move the laundry. Ultimately, you'll want to present a space that won't take away from the lesson.</p> \n<p>Alternatively, if you decide your space isn't camera-ready, you don't have to show it. Turn your camera off and let the presentation be the visual, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/m/webinar-series/churn-facebook-creatives-remotely\">like this one from Facebook</a>. If you go this route, though, you'll likely need an animator or designer to make sure your presentation is engaging enough to keep the viewer's interest.</p> \n<h3>3. Perform a practice version for mistakes.</h3> \n<p>Before you officially record, practice using the software. Familiarize yourself with how to export and upload a video so you'll be comfortable when the time comes.</p> \n<p>Practicing the full motions of the webinar helps with presentation and flow. When you watch it back, you can gauge how you come across, how you're speaking, and the impact of the lesson. Additionally, you'll see how to remedy technical difficulties — If it took you a little long to find <a href=\"https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/205566129-Raising-your-hand-in-a-webinar\">Zoom's \"hand raiser\" tool</a>, for instance, you can practice the motion to speed up the process.</p> \n<p>If you're thinking that you won't have time to fit in multiple test runs, don't worry. You won't need the full hour to practice your presentation. Instead, record the section you're most unsure about — that way, you can tweak things to make it better.</p> \n<p>Alternatively, maybe your test run tells you that you need more help with the creation part. If that's the case, head on over to this guide for <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-is-a-webinar?_ga=2.113529735.1276787802.1596678320-940436819.1565181751\">making a compelling webinar</a> of your own. Otherwise, after you're comfortable with your setting and presentation, you're ready to record the real deal</p> \n<h3>4. Edit your presentation for professionality.</h3> \n<p>Recorded webinars aren't live, and because of that, things don't stop when it ends. After you finish your presentation, end the recording and then, export your video and watch it for any mistakes.</p> \n<p>Small mistakes, like a fumble on words, are normal. If you come across them, don't feel as if they should be edited out — after all, humans slip up every day. However, glaring mistakes, like recording the video too early, should be edited.</p> \n<p>The great thing about recorded webinars is that you have the option to edit. And, if you're not recording for a live audience, you have more room to tweak the final version. Look at your work before it goes up for the world to see so you and your company are represented professionally.</p> \n<p>Additionally, if you need to change anything about your presentation based on timing, you can trim certain parts. If you're recording it live, take note of any audience participation exercises that might be easy to replicate after the live version. Trivia questions can be fun past the live taping of the webinar, for example.</p> \n<h3>5. Share your webinar.</h3> \n<p>Now, you're ready to share your recording! You might have a plan for how you want to distribute it — especially if it's an event for your customers. But, if this is a stage you're stuck on, here are some ideas for sharing.</p> \n<p>Webinars have the great advantage of being extremely sharable. Even though it's a long format, they usually contain highly valuable information that audiences want to see. Plus, video is an <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/state-of-marketing?_ga=2.113529735.1276787802.1596678320-940436819.1565181751\">incredibly popular format</a> and often does better than text for attracting a large audience.</p> \n<h4>1. Landing Page</h4> \n<p>Create a landing page where your webinar will live. It's convenient to do this, as you can track page performance. You can use the extra space of a landing page for copy explaining what viewers will gain from the webinar, or helpful resources that relate to the lesson.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Lights,%20Camera,%20Action%20How%20to%20Record%20a%20Webinar%20Worth%20Replaying-2.png\" alt=\"A landing page for a webinar. \" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n</div> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'times new roman', times;\"><a href=\"https://business.linkedin.com/marketing-solutions/webinars/20/06/essential-strategies-for-targeting-on-linkedin\">Image Source</a></span></p> \n<p>This one, from LinkedIn, is very minimal. Below, there's a short description of the webinar, as well as background about the platform itself. Your page shouldn't be busy, just informative. Tell the audience what they'll get out of the lesson.</p> \n<h4>2. Social Media</h4> \n<p>Share your webinar with your followers to increase traffic. For example, this one, about a dental tool, was shared on Facebook:</p> \n<iframe style=\"border: none; overflow: hidden; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\" src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FZahnDental%2Fvideos%2F616142932578899%2F&amp;show_text=1&amp;width=560\" width=\"560\" height=\"512\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n<p>LinkedIn is a popular social networking site for webinars because of its unique emphasis on professional content. If you go that route, it's likely you'll find qualified leads. Ultimately, though, go where your followers are. For instance, if most of your traffic comes from Facebook, choose Facebook.</p> \n<h4>3. Email Marketing</h4> \n<p>Don't forget to remind your audience about the recorded webinar. In weekly newsletters, hyperlink the video. Your content will get more views, and your customers will love the extra content in their inbox. Check out the one I got last week, for instance:</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Lights,%20Camera,%20Action%20How%20to%20Record%20a%20Webinar%20Worth%20Replaying-1.png\" alt=\"An email marketing message for a webinar.\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n</div> \n<p>Before the email, I had no idea the webinar was happening. Even if you promote the webinar, you can't catch <em>every</em> customer with just a couple of channels. Leverage multiple messaging channels to maximize participation.</p> \n<h4>4. Blog Posts</h4> \n<p>Webinars can live in multiple spaces on your website. If your recording was about social media marketing, and you have a guide on the subject, consider embedding a snippet of the webinar onto the post. You'll snag more traffic that way, and make the piece itself more actionable.</p> \n<p>Let's look at this example:</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Lights,%20Camera,%20Action%20How%20to%20Record%20a%20Webinar%20Worth%20Replaying.png\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" alt=\"An example of a webinar embedded into a blog post.\">\n</div> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'times new roman', times;\"><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/are-webinars-dead-how-to-make-a-webinar\">Image Source</a></span></p> \n<p>Here, we see the webinar added to the blog post to make it more engaging. Readers who want the full run-down can follow along with the post. Additionally, those who are visually impaired will find value in being able to hear the topic explained in an accessible format.</p> \n<p>Webinars diversify the content you offer. Recorded ones are great for accessibility and extended value. Long after the initial recording, you can still earn leads from them.</p> \n<p>Every day on my lunch break, I have a recorded webinar queued up and ready to go. The next time I'm scouring the internet, looking for the next winner, will I see yours among the rest of the amazing content?</p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fblog%2Ftabid%2F6307%2Fbid%2F9990%2Fhow-to-record-a-webinar.aspx&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 05 Aug 2020 23:45:00 +0000","feedId":924,"bgimg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Lights,%20Camera,%20Action%20How%20to%20Record%20a%20Webinar%20Worth%20Replaying-2.png","linkMd5":"8ce6c5b27c0fab30f0338805d8558b22","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn15@2020_5/2020/08/16/13-48-27-650_e24cb6c6f3c65061.webp","author":"Kayla Carmicheal","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Lights,%20Camera,%20Action%20How%20to%20Record%20a%20Webinar%20Worth%20Replaying-2.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn87@2020_3/2020/08/16/13-48-39-407_e24cb6c6f3c65061.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Lights,%20Camera,%20Action%20How%20to%20Record%20a%20Webinar%20Worth%20Replaying-1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn100@2020_5/2020/08/16/13-48-36-822_9307b230c5a4c928.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Lights,%20Camera,%20Action%20How%20to%20Record%20a%20Webinar%20Worth%20Replaying.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn76@2020_4/2020/08/16/13-48-36-712_2fdd55a42377d904.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fblog%2Ftabid%2F6307%2Fbid%2F9990%2Fhow-to-record-a-webinar.aspx&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn16@2020_2/2020/08/16/13-48-31-952_d8618e84f8d4ab53.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 21:48:26","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 21:48:26","title":"How 3 HubSpot Managers Found Strong Co-Marketing Partnerships [+How You Can, Too]","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/co-marketing-partner-tips","description":"<p>A solid <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/34188/what-in-the-heck-is-co-marketing.aspx\">co-marketing</a> partnership is one of the better ways to reach a previously untapped audience, generate positive publicity, and create a wealth of valuable marketing collateral. When done right, it's a mutually beneficial, thoroughly productive way to boost your marketing efforts as a whole.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Aligning yourself with an industry peer can pay off in spades, but these kinds of relationships aren't easy to start and sustain. Your partner's interests and qualities need to complement yours, and the companies you work with have to be reliable enough to consistently pull their weight.</p> \n<p>Finding a company that fits that bill is hard in its own right, but once you've identified one you want to work with, you're faced with the challenges of successfully contacting them, corresponding with them, and convincing them to work with you.</p> \n<p>Those processes can be hard to figure out on your own, so to offer you some help, we spoke with three HubSpot experts about how they found strong co-marketing partnerships and the steps you need to take to do the same.</p> \n<h2>What do you look for in a co-marketing partner?</h2> \n<p>When asked about what they look for in a co-marketing partner, our experts all seemed to agree that the number one priority is alignment in audience, messaging, and image. As HubSpot Senior Marketing Manager, Margot Mazur, put it, <em>\"We look for partners who speak to similar personas and address their needs. Specifically, we want to make sure our partners have a similar audience and voice — with similar values and goals to meet.\"</em></p> \n<p>Though finding a company that checks those boxes is central to a successful co-marketing partnership, there's still a lot more to the process. You might identify a potential partner that lines up well with your brand identity and appeals to a similar audience, but co-marketing partnerships need to be productive and mutually beneficial — you need to know you'll get something out of it.</p> \n<p>According to HubSpot Marketing Manager, Diego Santos, <em>\"Once we are happy with [a potential partner's] suitability, we classify them according to a co-marketing matrix — one that takes the partner's popularity, relevance, and objective into consideration. This process helps us to prioritize collaborations and look at the big picture.\"</em></p> \n<p>Ideological and objective-oriented alignment isn't enough. There needs to be hard, quantifiable potential behind a co-marketing partnership. As Mazur said,<em> \"We also look at a potential partner's audience across social and email channels, making sure that our businesses are of a similar size.\"</em></p> \n<p>Co-marketing partnerships are, at their core, strategic plays. They can be invaluable assets in targeted marketing efforts. For instance, HubSpot Marketing Manager, Clara Landecy, spoke on how they can be leveraged to target specific areas, <em>\"I always look for partners who have a strong presence in targeted regions. Partnering with local partners is essential if your company does business in multiple languages and across the globe.\"</em></p> \n<p>Santos succinctly captured all those points when he laid out the key questions to consider when finding co-marketing partners, <em>\"We usually ask ourselves the following questions to make sure they are a good fit: Who are they? What is their area of expertise? And who — and how big — is their audience?\"</em></p> \n<p>It's important to have a firm understanding of what you want out of a co-marketing partnership before approaching potential partners. Find a company with similar values that will enhance your ability to effectively reach your target audience — one that will pull its weight, complement your messaging, and ultimately suit your long term goals.</p> \n<h2>How do you approach and connect with potential co-marketing partners?</h2> \n<p>Our experts stressed the importance of a personal touch in connecting with potential co-marketing partners. As Santos put it, <em>\"A more personal, network-oriented approach is usually much more effective than a cold introductory email or message.\"</em></p> \n<p>Co-marketing partnerships are inherently personal, so it's only fitting that you start your relationship with your partner off on a <em>personal</em> note. But how do you get there?</p> \n<p>Well, according to our experts, your best bet is leveraging resources and co-workers from within your own company. Landecy said, <em>\"To increase your response rate, ask your colleagues if they have any contacts at the companies you’re looking to partner with, warm outreach always helps.\"</em></p> \n<p>Santos agreed, <em>\"We always try to leverage the connections we already have in HubSpot. When we are looking for partners in a particular area, we reach out to everyone in the relevant regional team and encourage them to send ideas of potential collaborations.\"</em></p> \n<p>Mazur reiterated their points but added some insight about what she does when she can't reach potential partners through her colleagues, <em>\"Generally, I'll see if anyone at HubSpot already has a connection to someone at the partner company. If not, I'll reach out to a partnership, BD, or marketing person at the company on LinkedIn, using their InMail tool.\"</em> As I mentioned earlier, no matter how you reach potential partners you need to do so with a personal touch.</p> \n<p>Do your homework. Make sure you have a firm grasp on the nature of the company you're contacting, what it might need out of a co-marketing partnership, and what you can do to suit its objectives and interests. Or as Landecy said, <em>\"Make sure your outreach is personalized! Showing you did the research before reaching out shows you are invested in the potential partnership and makes their work feel special!\"</em></p> \n<p>But let's say you don't have the know-how and personal connections to identify and reach potential co-marketing partners. You're at a loss when it comes to finding interested companies whose size, values, and interests line up with your own.</p> \n<p>What can you do? Well, there are certain tools designed to expedite the process. For instance, <a href=\"https://www.crossbeam.com/?utm_source=adwords&amp;utm_campaign=9977203105_100586914017_441699244276&amp;utm_term=&amp;utm_term=&amp;utm_campaign=Content+Lead+Generation+(Blog)&amp;utm_source=adwords&amp;utm_medium=ppc&amp;hsa_acc=7141001143&amp;hsa_cam=9977203105&amp;hsa_grp=100586914017&amp;hsa_ad=441699244276&amp;hsa_src=g&amp;hsa_tgt=dsa-915029285266&amp;hsa_kw=&amp;hsa_mt=b&amp;hsa_net=adwords&amp;hsa_ver=3&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIvOqtlKqW6wIVCTiGCh1VyQ9VEAAYASAAEgKksPD_BwE\"><span>Crossbeam</span></a> is a resource that leverages CRM data to help you find and connect with potential co-marketing partners with overlapping customer bases and other complementary attributes.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, a solid co-marketing partnership has tremendous potential that's only seen after tremendous effort. It often takes extensive research and critical thought just to identify the companies that suit your values, goals, and qualities. And actually conducting the necessary outreach and communication to establish one adds a whole new, often exhausting layer to the process.</p> \n<p>Still, there's a lot to be gained from these kinds of arrangements. If your business is looking for a shot of life to your marketing efforts, pursuing a co-marketing partnership is something to consider.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fco-marketing-partner-tips&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 12 Aug 2020 19:45:00 +0000","feedId":924,"bgimg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/COMARKETING%20%281%29.jpg#keepProtocol","linkMd5":"b51605d148664a74132a069d63dd1ab4","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn31@2020_2/2020/08/16/13-48-27-469_f48edfe4afbb233d.webp","metaImg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/COMARKETING%20%281%29.jpg#keepProtocol","destWidth":598,"destHeight":398,"author":"jfuchs@hubspot.com (Jay Fuchs)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fco-marketing-partner-tips&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn39@2020_6/2020/08/16/13-48-35-456_ce74fcca29bc477f.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 21:48:26","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 21:48:26","title":"How to Make an Instagram Post Template for Your Business or Brand","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/instagram-post-template","description":"<p>Instagram is an undeniably powerful marketing tool, but with over <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/30/instagram-25-million-business-profiles/\">25 million businesses</a> on the platform today, it's critical you take the time to create well-designed and thoughtful Instagram posts to stand out.</p>   \n<p>You'll need to apply a strategic design plan to your business's Instagram to attract a loyal following and find success on the app, long-term.</p> \n<p>However, creating a clean and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/instagram-themes?_ga=2.102356865.1473434295.1539618369-1112480672.1531259004\">cohesive Instagram feed</a> takes design skills you might feel you lack.

A Guide to Co-Branding Marketing Campaigns","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/34188/what-in-the-heck-is-co-marketing.aspx","description":"<p><span style=\"letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: transparent;\">As marketers, we are always looking for new ways to get more bang for our buck. Co-marketing allows you to do just that — the process involves two or more companies working together to reap the benefits of their combined efforts. </span></p>  \n<p>We've compiled the co-marketing tips and tricks below to help you create a successful co-marketing campaign and relationship, from start to finish.</p> \n<h3></h3> \n<p></p> \n<p></p> \n<a></a> \n<p>Partner companies typically collaborate on promotional efforts for a co-branded offer. In a co-marketing partnership, both companies promote a piece of content or product, and share the results of that promotion.</p> \n<p>By levering the relationship and reach of a partner, co-marketing campaigns are designed to deliver more leads, buzz, and awareness, with less work.</p> \n<h3>Co-Marketing vs. Co-Branding</h3> \n<p>You've probably heard the terms <em>co-marketing</em> and<em> co-branding</em> thrown around quite a bit — but what's the difference? Is there one?</p> \n<p>Turns out, they’re actually pretty similar.</p> \n<p>While co-branding refers to a partnership in which two companies combine their products or expertise to create an even more valuable product or offer (Think: <a href=\"https://www.tacobell.com/food/tacos/nacho-cheese-doritos-locos-tacos\">Doritos Locos Tacos</a>), co-marketing takes things a step further.</p> \n<p>Co-marketing campaigns provide teams with an opportunity to work together to promote a shared offer — such as a co-branded product or piece of content. In a co-marketing partnership, both companies promote that offer, and share the results of that promotion with each other.</p> \n<p>More on how this process works next.</p> \n<h3>How does co-marketing work?</h3> \n<p>The most common way to co-market is for two companies that have similar audiences to work together on a piece of content or campaign, and promote it to both audiences.</p> \n<p>This content (e.g. ebook, webinar, template, etc.) typically sits behind a lead generation form to capture contact information. The goal is for both partners to share the downloads from the offer, thus getting twice the leads that they normally would.</p> \n<p>But that's not the only way to carry out a co-marketing campaign. Straying from the approach above, two partners might agree to host an event together and split the costs. Or, on a smaller scale, partners could agree to a series of guest blog posts on each other’s sites.</p> \n<p>The most important thing when deciding to do co-marketing with a certain partner, is to make sure the purpose and goal of the project is similar for both parties. If one partner wants leads, but another is looking for ticket sales to their annual event, you'll be hard-pressed to find a project that satisfies both needs.</p> \n<p>One aspect of virtually every co-marketing campaign you'll need is a shared landing page.</p> \n<h4>Co-Marketing Shared Landing Page</h4> \n<p>Both your content and landing page should be co-branded — and it should be obvious. This entails using both partner's logos in the header, and mentioning both partners throughout the content.</p> \n<p>Since you will likely be sharing the offer's downloads with your partner, you will need to consult with your legal team about the proper disclaimer to include at the bottom of the form.</p> \n<p>For example, <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/digital-marketing-with-google\">our offer with Google</a> simply states that we are authorized to share their information with the specific partner after a user downloads the ebook.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202020-07-31%20at%203.18.17%20PM.png?width=1500&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202020-07-31%20at%203.18.17%20PM.png\" alt=\"example of a shared landing page for a co-marketing campaign\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13px; font-style: italic;\"><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/digital-marketing-with-google\">Source</a></span></p> \n<p>To keep things organized within your marketing automation tool, we also suggest that you come up with a unique code for naming these co-branded pages to differentiate them from your existing ones. Not to mention, this will make it easy to locate them via internal search.</p> \n<p>Next, you may be wondering how you should go about determining which businesses would be good partners for your business. Let's review the answer to that question next.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>How to Find the Right Co-Marketing Partners to Work With</h2> \n<p>In any co-marketing relationship, you want to make sure there is mutual benefit to working together. Check out tips in determining if a partner is a good fit <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/co-marketing-partner-tips\">here</a>.</p> \n<p>You can also ask yourself the following questions:</p> \n<ol> \n <li><strong>Do they have a similar type of audience that my company has and wants to grow?</strong> If not, the value I would get out of promoting our content to their audience may not be worth it.</li> \n <li><strong>How many new leads am I going to get from this partnership? Is it large enough to be worth my time?</strong> Only you can decide what is worth it.</li> \n <li><strong>Do they have some expertise that I don’t have?</strong> Let’s say my audience is dying to know more about how to optimize for local SEO, but my knowledge base is limited to general SEO knowledge. Maybe I partner with an expert on local SEO.</li> \n <li><strong>Does their brand and name have a good reputation?</strong> Don’t partner with people who will bring down your credibility.</li> \n <li><strong>Are the people you are working with enjoyable to work with?</strong> Sure, co-marketing is a job, but it should still be enjoyable. Look for partners that you actually look forward to working with.</li> \n</ol> \n<a></a> \n<h2>How to Plan a Co-Marketing Agreement</h2> \n<p>You've found a partner to work with — that's great! But, what's the next step?</p> \n<h3>1. Come up with an idea to pitch.</h3> \n<p>Once you determine you'd like to work with a partner, it's time to come up with an idea to pitch. When approaching this step, do your homework first. Learn what you can about the company and their audience, tailor your ideas to what would be appealing to them, and show them the value you're going to provide.</p> \n<p>Odds are, if you are the one pitching the idea, you are the small fish and they are the big fish. In other words, it'd be easy for them to say no in this scenario. To combat this, go the extra mile to show them that they'd be crazy not to work with you.</p> \n<p>If you are on the other end of the pitch, remain open to ideas. Even if the person pitching you isn’t a pro, don’t disregard the opportunity immediately. If it's a totally unrealistic partnership, be honest with them. And if the idea sounds interesting but it's just not a great time for you to take on the project, consider adding them to a backlog of potential partners you'd want to work with in the future.</p> \n<h3>2. Make your goals clear.</h3> \n<p><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">If you want leads, make sure your partner knows that. Make sure they also want leads, too. If your goals are misaligned, neither of you will get value you had hoped and planned for out of the relationship.</span></p> \n<h3><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">3. Agree on the content you'll share and promote. </span></h3> \n<p><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">Next, agree on the type of content you'll share and promote among your audience. This includes the topic and theme of the content. <span style=\"color: #33475b;\">Decide on a topic that is going to be mutually beneficial and appeal to both audiences.</span></span></p> \n<h3><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">4. Determine your timeline.<span style=\"color: #33475b;\"> </span></span></h3> \n<p>Set a timeline for your co-marketing campaign. This way, everyone is on the same page and gets their portion of the work done on time.</p> \n<p>Pro Tip: <span style=\"color: #33475b;\">For a larger project, like an ebook or webinar, double the amount of time it takes your team to write a campaign on your own. This will allow for time for approvals and feedback among your team members and your partner's team members.</span></p> \n<h3>5. Decide what your strong skills are.<span style=\"color: #33475b;\"> </span></h3> \n<p><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">Between the your business and your partner's, it's likely you both have specific strengths and bring different things to the table. So, a<span style=\"color: #33475b;\">ssign tasks and work accordingly. </span></span></p> \n<p><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">Simply, if you assign tasks related to your co-marketing content and/or campaign based on which partner is better at what, the process will be streamlined and efficient (and likely, a lot more effective among audience members, too!).</span></p> \n<h3>6. Write up a formal co-marketing partnership agreement.</h3> \n<p>Like most things in business, it's important your co-marketing partnership is solidified and official. To do this, ensure it's in writing, in a formal agreement. With an agreement in place from the start, you have something to point back at if anything goes wrong or any miscommunications arise. (This may be a legal document or a non-legal document of good faith.)</p> \n<p>The details of this agreement should include:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">Topic</span></li> \n <li><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">Timeline</span></li> \n <li><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">Goals</span></li> \n <li><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">Ownership of content and assets (who is creating what?)</span></li> \n <li><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">Where the content will be hosted and shared</span></li> \n <li><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">Lead-sharing agreements</span></li> \n <li><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">Timeframe for promotion</span></li> \n <li><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">Promotional plan</span></li> \n <li><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">Reporting plan</span></li> \n</ul> \n<a></a> \n<h2>Types of Co-Marketing Content</h2> \n<p>Time to decide what type of co-marketing project you're going to work on. Below are a few common examples to help get the wheels turning.</p> \n<h4>Ebook</h4> \n<p>An ebook is a very common form of co-marketing content because it is easy to split up the work — someone lays out the design, someone else writes the content, and so on.</p> \n<p>Below is an <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/linkedin-social-selling?\">example of an ebook</a> HubSpot created with the LinkedIn Sales Solutions team:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202020-07-31%20at%201.50.52%20PM.png?width=1500&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202020-07-31%20at%201.50.52%20PM.png\" alt=\"co-marketing example of an ebook by hubspot and linkedin\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p style=\"font-size: 13px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/linkedin-social-selling\"><em>Source</em></a></p> \n<h4>Blog Post</h4> \n<p>Co-creating a blog post is one of the lower effort ways to do a co-marketing project. You may also each write a guest post for each other's blogs. For example, here's a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/sales-email-templates-examples\">guest post on the HubSpot blog</a>.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202020-07-31%20at%2011.22.39%20PM.png?width=1500&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202020-07-31%20at%2011.22.39%20PM.png\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" alt=\"co-marketing guest post blog post\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 13px;\"><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/sales-email-templates-examples\"><em>Source</em></a></p> \n<h4>Webinar</h4> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-is-a-webinar\">Webinars</a> are often the go-to type of co-marketing content. Why? Well, it's pretty easy to find an expert who is willing to talk for an hour on the topic of their expertise. It is also a well-known format for educational materials. And they're easy to co-host.</p> \n<p>Below is an example of a <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/grow-better-with-customer-feedback\">webinar that HubSpot hosted with partner, HotJar</a>.

This allows you to show your expertise, and invite and interact with members of both of your target audiences. Also, Twitter allows you to <a href=\"https://business.twitter.com/en/blog/how-to-promote-your-twitter-chat.html\">promote your Chat</a> to broaden your reach even more.</p> \n<p>Here's a list of <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/5835/10-examples-of-b2b-twitter-chats.aspx\">examples of Twitter Chats</a> for your review.</p> \n<h4>Event (Online or Offline)</h4> \n<p>Co-marketing can also take form in larger events, both in online or in person. You and your partner may host the event together and brand the entire event in a way that depicts and shares both of your branding and marketing.</p> \n<p>Aside from a webinar, you might host a live Q&amp;A. For instance, maybe your business has an employee be an interviewer for the session. Meanwhile, your partner can have one of their team members be the interviewee.</p> \n<p>For example, <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/adapt2020\">HubSpot's educational series, Adapt 2020,</a> offers a variety of content but the campaign includes live events that happen weekly. Those who choose to sign up are invited to a live, virtual event where industry experts — including HubSpot executives, HubSpot partners, and more — discuss the chosen topic of the week.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202020-07-31%20at%202.59.32%20PM.png?width=2020&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202020-07-31%20at%202.59.32%20PM.png\" alt=\"adapt 2020 campaign example of live events\" width=\"2020\" style=\"width: 2020px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p style=\"font-size: 13px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/adapt2020\"><em>Source</em></a></p> \n<p>Once you choose the type of co-marketing content you'll move forward with, it's time for you and your partner to plan the execution of your campaign.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>How to Execute Your Co-Marketing Campaign</h2> \n<p>There are some steps you should work through to effectively execute your co-marketing campaign with your partner.</p> \n<h3>1. Outline your co-marketing campaign.</h3> \n<p>Once you have chosen your topic and form of co-marketing, start with a shared Google Doc — brain dump, collaborate, and outline your plan here.</p> \n<p>By using a Google Doc from the start, you your team and your partner's team can simultaneously edit and add to the details on the Doc. In terms of timing, allow both of your teams about a week or so to hash out and finalize all ideas/ plans in this Doc.</p> \n<h3>2. Begin content creation.</h3> \n<p>Once you have agreed on the outline, assigned marketers can jump in and begin content creation. Typically, I split the creation of content between partners by having one partner write and another design, so that voice and design are consistent.</p> \n<p>The other option is to have each partner write up and design half of the content, and then fuse the two together. Keep in mind that this will require a thorough consistency check once both parts are brought together.</p> \n<p>After the first draft is complete, send to the partner to give feedback or approve. Give ample time between a writing due date and a feedback due date. I like to give a week if I have planned far enough in advance to allow for this.</p> \n<h3>3. Finalize your campaign content.</h3> \n<p>During the content finalization period, have your promotional team begin creating the assets needed to promote the content, such as the shared landing page as well as emails, social media images, infographics, blog posts, etc. Since working with a partner will likely take longer than a normal content creation process, this will help to save you some time.</p> \n<p>Next, it's time to promote your co-marketing content.</p> \n<h3>4. Promote your content.</h3> \n<p>It's important to set an agreed upon launch date with the partner. On this date, both teams’ email, social campaigns, and blog promotion should start.</p> \n<p>About two or three weeks prior to the launch date, have a brainstorm with all people involved from both teams to discuss what promotional tactics you will use and the timeframe for promotion. Will you both promote the same hashtag on Twitter? What audiences will you be promoting it to?</p> \n<p>Below are a few examples of how you can promote your content across various inbound marketing channels:</p> \n<h4>Blog Posts</h4> \n<p>Blog posts are a great way to drive traffic to your co-marketing content and offers. Common places to share co-marketing blog content include daily and weekly emails to subscribers, social accounts, and mutually agreed upon areas that you can reach target audience members. For example, at HubSpot, this content may be shared via HubSpot Academy.</p> \n<h4>Social Media</h4> \n<p>Promoting your content on social media is a great way to drive awareness to your co-marketing campaign and attract visitors to your site and content.</p> \n<p>Remember, tag your your co-marketing partner and ensure they do the same while sharing content that involves your business. This is easy to do and you'll benefit from the cross-promotion as members of each other's audiences will be able to view and interact with the content.</p> \n<h4>Email</h4> \n<p>Email is still one of the best ways to reach a large group of people at once — you can easily encourage recipients to attend your co-marketing webinar or event, or download your content.</p> \n<p>In your message, be clear that the email involves your brand and your partner — your co-marketing efforts should be clear, meaning it's obvious to all recipients that there are two companies involved.</p> \n<p><span class=\"content-post__body\"><span class=\"content-post__body\">If you're looking to track your partner's promotions efforts versus your own, be sure to create unique tracking URLs. This will help you determine which leads came from where. If you're a HubSpot user, here's how you can <a href=\"https://knowledge.hubspot.com/settings/how-do-i-create-a-tracking-url\">create unique tracking URLs</a>. </span></span></p> \n<p><span class=\"content-post__body\"><span class=\"content-post__body\">Speaking of tracking, let's talk more about how to measure your co-marketing efforts. </span></span></p> \n<h3>5. Measure your co-marketing campaign's results.</h3> \n<p>Your co-marketing campaign is live and being promoted — good work! Now it's time to look back and see if your initial efforts were successful.</p> \n<p>First and foremost, did you hit your original goal? If so, great. If not, why? What happened? Did you fail to hit the mark, or was it the partner? Keep these things in mind when making decisions to work with them a second time.</p> \n<p>Next, look to see if the leads generated through your co-marketing campaign were as high-quality as the leads you typically generate throughout your individual content and campaigns. Things to consider here are: lead-to-customer conversion rate, quality rating within your <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/marketing-automation\">automation tool</a> and <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/crm\">CRM</a>, and whether or not your sales team felt the leads were up to par.</p> \n<p>Finally, take a step back and ask yourself the following questions, too:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Was the partnership successful, in your opinion?</li> \n <li>Did your partner feel like the relationship was a helpful one for the campaign?</li> \n <li>Was it difficult to work with your partner, or smooth?</li> \n <li>Did you get high-quality content that you may not have been able to make without your partner?</li> \n <li>What worked well while working with this partner, and what didn't?</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Once the campaign is over, your partnership doesn't end. You should follow up with your co-marketing partner at this point.</p> \n<h3>6. Follow up with your co-marketing partner.</h3> \n<p>Communication with your partner throughout the co-marketing campaign if critical but you'll also want to debrief once the campaign comes to an end. While it typically doesn't make sense to do one project after another with the same partner, there may be an opportunity to work together again in the future.</p> \n<p>And if not, it's still important to keep a positive image for your brand and remain professional, no matter the outcome of the campaign.</p> \n<p>For instance, imagine you hosted a campaign's landing page on your website. Once the campaign ends, send over the leads generated from your form on that page to your partner. Often times, the easiest way to do this is to simply download the CSV file of leads from your database. If you are looking for a less manual process, you might use a tool like<a href=\"https://zapier.com/\"> Zapier</a> to send specific leads from your marketing automation platform to your partner’s.</p> \n<h2>Grow Better With Co-Marketing</h2> \n<p>There are so many ways for you and partners to benefit mutually from co-marketing. Don't be afraid to experiment with different types of campaigns and try working with different partners. This will help you determine what works best among your audience and, therefore, benefits your business most.</p> \n<p><span class=\"content-post__body\"><em><i>Editor's Note: This post was originally published in March 2013 and has been updated for accuracy and comprehensiveness.</i></em></span></p> \n<p></p> \n<div>\n <a class=\"close\"> </a>\n</div>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fblog%2Ftabid%2F6307%2Fbid%2F34188%2Fwhat-in-the-heck-is-co-marketing.aspx&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 04 Aug 2020 11:30:00 +0000","feedId":924,"bgimg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/guide%20to%20co-marketing.jpg#keepProtocol","linkMd5":"11bafb97e1433dfa4af33093541c05c1","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx17/cdn68@2020_4/2020/08/16/13-48-28-344_a979d1aa0a8d5268.webp","metaImg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/guide%20to%20co-marketing.jpg#keepProtocol","author":"asibley@hubspot.com (Amanda Sibley)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202020-07-31%20at%203.18.17%20PM.png?width=1500&name=Screen%20Shot%202020-07-31%20at%203.18.17%20PM.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn91@2020_4/2020/08/16/13-48-30-990_4c8b065572a43531.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202020-07-31%20at%201.50.52%20PM.png?width=1500&name=Screen%20Shot%202020-07-31%20at%201.50.52%20PM.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx20/cdn31@2020_5/2020/08/16/13-48-39-209_764f97df6ad01843.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202020-07-31%20at%2011.22.39%20PM.png?width=1500&name=Screen%20Shot%202020-07-31%20at%2011.22.39%20PM.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn52@2020_1/2020/08/16/13-48-36-656_9ffce9401b4334d0.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202020-07-31%20at%202.53.42%20PM.png?width=1500&name=Screen%20Shot%202020-07-31%20at%202.53.42%20PM.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn43@2020_5/2020/08/16/13-48-39-148_2038e57e41929d98.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202020-07-31%20at%202.50.08%20PM.png?width=1500&name=Screen%20Shot%202020-07-31%20at%202.50.08%20PM.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn63@2020_6/2020/08/16/13-48-37-691_d9c4d7aaec9dbb77.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202020-07-31%20at%202.59.32%20PM.png?width=2020&name=Screen%20Shot%202020-07-31%20at%202.59.32%20PM.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn59@2020_6/2020/08/16/13-48-35-042_5d7c41c087b9e879.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fblog%2Ftabid%2F6307%2Fbid%2F34188%2Fwhat-in-the-heck-is-co-marketing.aspx&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn28@2020_2/2020/08/16/13-48-30-118_3b862a8c2b0f048d.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 21:48:26","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 21:48:26","title":"How Broadcast Journalism Helped Me Pivot to Social Media Management","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/journalism-skills-social-media","description":"<p>Pivoting from a career in broadcast journalism was a <em>big</em> decision for me.</p> \n<p>I loved everything about a newsroom environment: the breaking news, researching topics, identifying sources for stories, and feeling like I had a pulse on trends and issues taking place in the world.</p> \n<p>I was successful at it, too. In fact, I worked at some of the biggest news corporations in the world, including CNN, ABC News, CBSLA and others.</p> \n<p>However, at some point — because I was spending so much time on social media listening for breaking news and looking for story ideas — my interest in social media <em>evolved</em>.</p> \n<p>I knew I wanted to make a transition, but I was scared of taking a leap and pivoting to social media marketing.</p> \n<p>Today, I can tell you that I'm so happy I did. I learned that my job is not my entire identity, and through journalism, I have so many transferrable skills to thrive in any industry.</p> \n<p>Switching careers can feel exciting, but comes with feelings of self-doubt and anxiety.</p> \n<p>Here, I want to highlight how broadcast journalism helped me succeed in social media, and tips you can use if you're considering a career shift of your own.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h2><strong>7 Takeaways From Journalism You Can Apply to Social Media</strong></h2> \n<h3>1. Ask the 5 W questions.</h3> \n<p><em>Who? What? Where? When? and Why?</em> These questions are ingrained in any journalist.</p> \n<p>The foundational questions to news gathering also apply in the context of content creation, marketing plans, and any content strategy. For instance, any marketer likely asks these questions daily:</p> \n<p><em>Who is this message for?</em></p> \n<p><em>What is the core message we want them to take away from this?</em></p> \n<p><em>When (and where) are they most likely to be to consume this message?</em></p> \n<p><em>Why should they care? </em></p> \n<p>\"Why\" also goes a little deeper in social media. The internet is flooded with information and it's your job to capture someone's attention — and hold their attention for your content.</p> \n<p><em>Why would someone click on this ad?</em></p> \n<p><em>Why are we targeting this group?</em></p> \n<p><em>Why is it important that they see this message? </em></p> \n<p>The root of these questions have helped me cut through the jargon of promotions and company announcements to get to the root of the message in the simplest words.</p> \n<p><strong>Pro Tip</strong>: In journalism school, I learned to simplify the facts by \"explaining this story to my mom.\" This framework has really helped me simplify information down to its core. I practice this often when trying to take a complex company announcement and whittle it down to its simplest takeaway.</p> \n<h3>2. Focus on the core story, not the details.</h3> \n<p>When it comes to creating content, journalists have a unique element they bring to the table: storytelling.</p> \n<p>Some people may get caught up in numbers, the tagline, a paragraph in an announcement, and so on.</p> \n<p>As a former journalist, I think about the core of the message we want to convey in a social post.</p> \n<p>The key takeaway could involve visual elements and emotional triggers, but its foundation will include a concise message or story.</p> \n<h3>3. Keep up-to-date on industry and competitor trends.</h3> \n<p>The advantage journalism has provided me when it comes to conducting research is that, even if you have an intuitive sense of your audience, your journalism instincts still compel you to \"look into it\" and confirm your hypothesis.</p> \n<p>For instance, for conducing market research — including what my audience is feeling, thinking, struggling with, dreaming of, reading about, etc. — I put my \"investigative\" hat on and look within Facebook Groups, or other websites where people can leave comments or questions (such as Quora or Amazon reviews) to gather information about what my audience is seeing, thinking, and feeling.</p> \n<p>Additionally, a couple of <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-do-keyword-research-ht\">keyword searches</a> gives me a framework to work with while doing research.</p> \n<p>Referring to the latest studies, trends, and reports helps me identify any overlaps and enables me to be a successful social media professional because I keep a pulse on issues that are top-of-mind to my audience.</p> \n<p>A little research goes a long way in social media content and writing.</p> \n<p>Journalists are naturally curious people, so we sometimes find ourselves entertained by trends and topics that get people talking. We like to quickly parachute in on behavior like this and figure out what the hype is all about, source who started it, and figure out why it's taking off.</p> \n<p>It's amusing, to say the least, but this innate skill in journalists has helped me in social media because I can (for the most part) keep up with the latest memes, videos, or other trending news that's popular that day or week. It also helps me recall previous news events or trends that were popular in the past.</p> \n<p>Context of topics, audiences, and trends helps me while making editorial or marketing decisions and creating content.</p> \n<h3>4. Create quality content, even with minimal assets.</h3> \n<p>When it comes to content creation, journalists have had to work with little or major constraints when it comes to telling a story. You might have only a few usable sound bites, poor video quality, or you're working with only sound.</p> \n<p>Broadcast journalism helped me feel comfortable with improvising and maximizing any assets available.</p> \n<p>I learned how to do video, audio and photography editing. I learned different storytelling formats such as radio, TV, print, and online, as well as how to distinguish each piece (i.e. infographic, video, blog post, listicle) and how to adapt them to different social media platforms.</p> \n<p>I learned to do this in the most concise way possible, which helped me tremendously while writing short headlines and easy-to-understand text that includes a call to action.</p> \n<h3>5. Write concisely, and make every word count.</h3> \n<p>Whether it's copywriting, writing in a brand's voice, creating catchy headlines and titles, creating copy that converts a user, incorporating a call-to-action, or enticing a reader to learn more … it's all important in social media.</p> \n<p>Broadcast journalism helped my social media career with my writing skills alone. Ultimately, packaging information in a concise way is <em>so</em> important in social media.</p> \n<p>Twitter has a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Twitter/status/777915304261193728\">280 character limit</a>. However, I'm proud that I learned how to write tweets when it had a 140-character limit — including character counts toward photos, videos, and GIFs that were attached!</p> \n<p>Brevity is always a best practice when it comes to writing on social media, and broadcast journalism has helped me succeed in that regard.</p> \n<p>Effective writing helps your audience understand you, what you offer, and your value and is a critical skill for attracting an online audience.</p> \n<p><strong>Pro Tip</strong>: Practice reading your words out loud to catch typos or awkward sentence structures. I learned this while writing copy for TV news and it has helped me tremendously while crafting social media posts.</p> \n<h3>6. Learn how to communicate effectively in crises.&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>Social media is an extension of any brand, and understanding when something is a reputational risk is important.</p> \n<p>My career in broadcast journalism helped me identify potential pitfalls or anticipate remarks people might make. The last thing I want to do is appear tone-deaf or miss the mark with marketing messages.</p> \n<p>Working in broadcast journalism has trained me to never lower my guard and always keep my eyes open for threats or liabilities in social posts, marketing campaigns, and imagery.</p> \n<p>I also understand news cycles, and during a crisis, I've learned how to evolve and adapt to new circumstances and information.</p> \n<p>For example, during a crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic, there were different phases of crisis communication companies needed to understand.

Show up late for a job interview?</p>  \n<p>That's a bad first impression. Eat a ton of garlic and forget to brush your teeth before a first date? Also a bad first impression.</p> \n<p>It turns out that the \"make a good first impression\" principle holds true not only in face-to-face encounters, but in email interactions as well.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>When you send a welcome email to a new blog or newsletter subscriber, or to a new customer, you're making a first impression on behalf of your brand. To help ensure you're making the best first impression possible, we've rounded up some examples of standout welcome emails from brands big and small.</p> \n<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Use HubSpot's <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/email\">free email marketing software</a> to easily create a high-quality welcome email sequence like the ones featured below.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Email%20Template,%20Blog%20Image.jpg?width=400&amp;name=Email%20Template,%20Blog%20Image.jpg\" width=\"400\" style=\"width: 400px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" alt=\"free welcome Email Template to send to customers\"></p> \n<p>As you'll soon discover, each example below showcases different tactics and strategies for engaging new email subscribers. Let's dive in.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\"></p> \n<h2>10 Examples of Standout Welcome Emails</h2> \n<h3>1. <a href=\"https://www.virginamerica.com/\">Virgin America</a></h3> \n<h4>Type of welcome: Get Started</h4> \n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/virgin-america-welcome-email.png\" alt=\"Virgin America welcome email with a red CTA to get started\" title=\"virgin-america-welcome-email.png\"></p> \n<p>A welcome email is the perfect medium for introducing folks to the characteristics (and eccentricities) that make your brand unique.</p> \n<p>For Virgin America, that means putting the \"I love you\" hand symbol front and center. This small gesture signals to the recipient that the folks atVirgin America really care about their customers. The playful accompanying copy, \"Welcome aboard,\" and casual call-to-action, \"Grab a seat,\" also help to position Virgin America as a hip, fun-loving brand right off the bat.</p> \n<h3>2. <a href=\"https://food52.com/\">Food52</a></h3> \n<h4>Type of welcome: Get Started</h4> \n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/food-52-welcome-email.png\" alt=\"Food52 welcome email with a gray CTA to get started\" title=\"food-52-welcome-email.png\"></p> \n<p>Sometimes the tiniest of elements in a welcome email can speak volumes about a brand. And when it comes to Food52's welcome email, their preview text at the top of the email, \"We brought snacks,\" definitely accomplishes this.</p> \n<p>Also known as a pre-header or snippet text, preview text is the copy that gets pulled in from the body of an email and displayed next to (or beneath) the subject line in someone's inbox. So when you see Food52's welcome email in your inbox, you get a taste of their brand's personality before you even open it.</p> \n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/preview_text-3.png\" alt=\"preview_text-3.png\" title=\"preview_text-3.png\"></p> \n<p>Food52's welcome email also does a good job of building trust by putting a face (make that two faces) to their name. As soon as you open the email, you see a photograph of -- and welcome message from -- the company's founders.</p> \n<h3>3. Monday.com</h3> \n<h4>Type of welcome: Video</h4> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/monday.com-video-welcome-email.png\" alt=\"Monday.com welcome email with a link to watch a video by CEO Roy Man\"></p> \n<p>From the subject line to the conversational tone in the email body, the welcome email above keeps it friendly and simple so the focus stays on the introductory video inside.</p> \n<p>Monday.com is a task management tool for teams and businesses, and the welcome email you get when you sign up makes you feel like the CEO, Roy Man, is talking directly to you. The email even personalizes the opening greeting by using the recipient's first name -- this is well known for <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics\">increasing email click-through rates</a> (especially if the name is in the subject line).</p> \n<p>The closer you can get to making your email sound like a one-on-one conversation between you and your subscriber, the better. If you have just so many details you need to inform your new customer of, follow Monday.com's lead and embed them in a video, rather than spelling them all out in the email itself.</p> \n<h3>4. <a href=\"https://www.katespade.com/\">Kate Spade</a></h3> \n<h4>Type of welcome: Thank You</h4> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/kate-spade-welcome-email.png\" alt=\"Kate Spade welcome email with orange envelope graphic saying thank you\" title=\"kate-spade-welcome-email.png\"></p> \n<p>Let's face it: We, the internet-using public, are constantly bombarded with prompts to sign up for and subscribe to all sorts of email communications. So as a brand, when someone takes the time to sift through all the chaos in order to intentionally sign up for <em>your</em> email communications, it's a big deal.</p> \n<p>In order to acknowledge how grateful they are to the folks who actually take the time to subscribe, Kate Spade uses a simple -- but effective -- tactic with their welcome emails: They say \"Thank You\" in big, bold lettering. And by placing that \"Thank You\" on an envelope, Kate Spade recreates the feeling of receiving an actual thank-you letter in the mail. (The 15% off discount code doesn't hurt either.)</p> \n<h3>5. Lyft</h3> \n<h4>Type of welcome: Get Started</h4> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/lyft-welcome-email.png?width=690&amp;name=lyft-welcome-email.png\" alt=\"Lyft welcome email with pink CTA to get started\" width=\"690\" style=\"width: 690px;\"></p> \n<p>If there's an ideal \"attitude\" that welcome emails should give off, Lyft has got it.</p> \n<p>The company's simple but vibrant welcome email, shown above, focuses entirely on the look and feel of the app, delivering a design that's as warm and smooth as the lifts that Lyft wants to give you. At the same time, the email's branded pink call-to-action draws your eyes toward the center of the page to \"Take a Ride\" -- inviting language that doesn't make you feel pressured as a new user.</p> \n<h3>6. <a href=\"http://www.ikea.com/\" style=\"font-size: 1.5rem;\">IKEA</a></h3> \n<h4>Type of welcome: Offer</h4> \n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/ikea-welcome-email.png\" alt=\"IKEA welcome email with offer to join free membership\" title=\"ikea-welcome-email.png\"></p> \n<p>It might not be the most beautifully designed email on this list, but that doesn't mean IKEA's welcome email isn't effective.</p> \n<p>Instead of going for the hard sell (e.g., \"By stuff now!\"), or explaining what it is they do (which is something IKEA probably assumes most people already know), IKEA uses its welcome email to turn folks onto its other, lesser-known programs and content channels. For example, there's a call-to-action right at the top that explains the value of its member benefits program. There are also prompts to visit their design blog and to contribute to their collaborative \"Share Space\" site.</p> \n<p>Of course, if you're not interested in any of that stuff, IKEA's welcome email also makes it easy for you to simply log in and start shopping (there's a login field right up top).</p> \n<h3>7. <a href=\"http://www.michaels.com/\">Michaels</a></h3> \n<h4>Type of welcome: Offer</h4> \n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/michaels-welcome-email.png\" alt=\"Michaels welcome email with offer of 20% off an entire purchase\" title=\"michaels-welcome-email.png\"></p> \n<p>The Michaels approach to the welcome email borrows elements from both Kate Spade and Virgin America. In addition to expressing gratitude to the folks who took the time to sign up, Michaels uses its welcome email to showcase the brand. And the company does a great job: The lengthy email feels like one big arts and crafts project, complete with paint, yarn, and chalkboards.</p> \n<p>Another standout feature of this welcome email is that Michaels makes it immediately clear what value its future email communications are going to provide. After thanking subscribers, there's this nice bit of copy that sums it up:</p> \n<p>\"We're going to send fun stuff like DIY tips and tricks, invites to in-store events, and exclusive deals and coupons.\"</p> \n<h3>8. Sphero</h3> \n<h4>Type of welcome: Hello</h4> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/sphero-welcome-email.png?width=690&amp;name=sphero-welcome-email.png\" alt=\"Sphero welcome email with BB-8 Star Wars Droid saying hello\" width=\"690\" style=\"width: 690px;\"></p> \n<p>Sphero's welcome email might in fact be the cutest one we've seen recently -- and it was sent from a galaxy far, far away.</p> \n<p>If you purchase a bluetooth-controlled BB-8, the friendly Droid from <em>Star Wars</em>, it was probably made by Sphero. And if it was, you'll have an email similar to the one above waiting in your inbox when you activate your new rolling companion.</p> \n<p>This email's subject line is what qualifies it for this list -- \"A little Droid told us you wanted our emails.\" By cleverly personifying the product, and being somewhat candid about its <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/email\">email marketing</a> newsletters, Sphero develops a relationship with their recipients through the product you just bought from them.</p> \n<p>Besides showing you how to use your new BB-8 Droid with your smartphone, all this welcome email wanted to do was say hi -- just like BB-8 himself.</p> \n<h3>9. <a href=\"https://www.invisionapp.com/\">InVision</a></h3> \n<h4>Type of welcome: Video</h4> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/invision-welcome-email.png\" alt=\"InVision welcome email with link to watch video\" title=\"invision-welcome-email.png\"></p> \n<p>When you sign up for InVision's free prototyping app, the welcome email makes it very clear what your next step should be: using the app.</p> \n<p>To facilitate this action, InVision's welcome email doesn't simply list out what you need to do in order to get started. Instead, it <em>shows you</em> what you need to do with a series of quick videos. Given the visual, interactive nature of the product, this makes a lot of sense.</p> \n<h3>10. <a href=\"http://www.drift.com/\">Drift</a></h3> \n<h4>Type of welcome: Get Started</h4> \n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/drift-welcome-email-1.png\" alt=\"Drift welcome email with link to get started\" title=\"drift-welcome-email-1.png\"></p> \n<p>No fancy design work. No videos. No photos. The welcome email Drift sends out after signing up for their newsletter is a lesson in minimalism.</p> \n<p>The email opens with a bit of candid commentary on the state of email. \"Most people have really long welcome email sequences after you get on their email list,\" Dave from Drift writes, before continuing: \"Good news: we aren't most people.\" What follows is simply a bulleted list of the company's most popular blog posts. And the only mention of the product comes in a brief post-script at the very end.</p> \n<p>If you're trying to craft a welcome email that's non-interruptive, and that's laser-focused on adding value vs. fluff, this is a great example to follow.</p> \n<p><em>Editor's note: This post was originally published in April, 2016 and has been updated for comprehensiveness.</em></p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fwelcome-email-examples&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 07 Aug 2020 15:08:00 +0000","feedId":924,"bgimg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/welcome-email-examples.jpg#keepProtocol","linkMd5":"dd3aad22891870a7e45a5d47ea543ca0","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn79@2020_4/2020/08/16/13-48-28-412_0cac56d01dd07369.webp","metaImg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/welcome-email-examples.jpg#keepProtocol","author":"edevaney@hubspot.com (Erik Devaney)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Email%20Template,%20Blog%20Image.jpg?width=400&name=Email%20Template,%20Blog%20Image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn75@2020_5/2020/08/16/13-48-31-609_03a99e311eca0ea0.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/virgin-america-welcome-email.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn15@2020_6/2020/08/16/13-48-38-788_8fdeac7429e2fd25.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/food-52-welcome-email.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn84@2020_1/2020/08/16/13-48-38-498_ce0f7ae78d84f539.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/preview_text-3.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn88@2020_3/2020/08/16/13-48-29-722_8ead1ba4a4c18e18.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/monday.com-video-welcome-email.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn23@2020_4/2020/08/16/13-48-38-923_6da7f4217aa13774.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/kate-spade-welcome-email.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn48@2020_6/2020/08/16/13-48-36-472_d1744136ddd5194f.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/lyft-welcome-email.png?width=690&name=lyft-welcome-email.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn3@2020_3/2020/08/16/13-48-33-693_35eb0c271499fe78.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/ikea-welcome-email.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn59@2020_2/2020/08/16/13-48-35-712_ea99e095eb844cf1.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/michaels-welcome-email.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn36@2020_4/2020/08/16/13-48-32-931_d651c206de0777df.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/sphero-welcome-email.png?width=690&name=sphero-welcome-email.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn16@2020_5/2020/08/16/13-48-29-455_c2c78bb8f30c40d7.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/invision-welcome-email.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn64@2020_1/2020/08/16/13-48-30-685_e35af7101e39b26a.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/drift-welcome-email-1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn8@2020_4/2020/08/16/13-48-29-115_08c1ef8de2ef95cd.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fwelcome-email-examples&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn71@2020_2/2020/08/16/13-48-36-757_9041613ae476bd94.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 21:48:25","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 21:48:25","title":"How to Write a Request for Proposal with Template and Sample","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/rfp-template","description":"<p>Whether you’re working for a small agency or a major marketing firm, you’re probably eventually going to need to fill out a Request for Proposal, or RFP.</p> \n<p>Your company can’t do everything internally, and when your business needs to purchase a product or service from elsewhere, you might need to shop around. An RFP allows you to collect offers from various vendors and select the vendor that best meets your criteria, both in regards to skill and budget.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Any time you outsource work to a supplier, there's a potential for issues such as miscommunication around the scope of the work and the compensation. What a good RFP does is eliminate gray area so that both parties understand what needs to be delivered, when, and for how much.</p> \n<p><span style=\"color: #33475b; font-size: 1.1em; font-weight: 300; letter-spacing: 0.01em;\"></span></p> \n<h2><strong>RFP Template</strong></h2> \n<p>Here, we’ve provided an RFP template you can follow for initial structure, as well as a sample RFP for further inspiration.

At the top of a standard RFP, you'll find the following:</p> \n<p><em>Project Name or Description</em></p> \n<p><em>Company Name</em></p> \n<p><em>Address</em></p> \n<p><em>City, State, Zip Code</em></p> \n<p><em>Procurement Contact Person</em></p> \n<p><em>Telephone Number of PCP</em></p> \n<p><em>Email Address of PCP</em></p> \n<p><em>Fax Number<br /></em></p> \n<p>The body of the RFP will contain additional details about the project, including:</p> \n<ol> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/rfp-template#background\">Background/Introduction</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/rfp-template#goals-scope\">Project Goals and Scope of Services</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/rfp-template#selection-schedule\">Anticipated Selection Schedule</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/rfp-template#proposal-submission\">Time and Place of Submission of Proposals</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/rfp-template#timeline\">Timeline</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/rfp-template#elements\">Elements of Proposal</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/rfp-template#evaluation-criteria\">Evaluation Criteria</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/rfp-template#roadblocks\">Possible Roadblocks</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/rfp-template#budget\">Budget</a></li> \n</ol> \n<p>Read on to learn more about what goes into each of these sections so that you can build an RFP of your own.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>1. Background/Introduction</h3> \n<p>In your introductory paragraph, you’ll want to include useful background information about your company — who founded it, what product or service your company offers, what sets you apart from competitors, and where you’re located. If any vendor is serious about working with you, they’ll want this information before moving forward.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>2. Project Goals and Scope of Services</h3> \n<p>Next, you’ll want to outline the project you need completed, and the goals you expect to accomplish from the project. It’s important you get as specific as possible — even outlining individual tasks and criteria involved. You’ll want to include phrases such as “The award will be given to X firm,” with the “X” establishing how you’ll determine the best candidate.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>3. Anticipated Selection Schedule</h3> \n<p>It’s crucial you include a detailed schedule so vendors know if they can meet your deadlines. You’ll also need to give vendors a window for when they can ask questions regarding your project. This’ll limit the hassle, for you and for them.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>4. Time and Place of Submission of Proposals</h3> \n<p>Similar to paragraph #3, this is important information you’ll want to clearly present, so vendors know how and where to submit themselves for consideration.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>5. Timeline</h3> \n<p>By including a time frame in your RFP, you’re able to eliminate any vendor who can’t work within your time constraints. If you’re flexible on your time, you can write something like, “Our company hopes to finish the project within six months, but we’re open to negotiation for the right candidate.”</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>6. Elements of Proposal</h3> \n<p>If you don’t outline clearly and specifically what you expect bidders to include in their proposal, you can’t necessarily fault them if they don’t include it. It’s critical you outline a checklist so vendors know which elements you’re expecting to receive. It’s also a good test for who’s capable of handling your demands — if a vendor can’t complete all elements of your proposal, you probably can’t trust them to finish your project, either.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>7. Evaluation Criteria</h3> \n<p>Outlining your expectations will help eliminate vendors who don’t meet them. For this section, you’ll want to do some brainstorming with your team to come up with a mandatory list of items you feel are the best indicators of impressive candidates. Your list could include samples of past work, a proven success record with companies in similar industries, the expertise and technical skills to meet your demands, and a cost of services within your price range.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>8. Possible Roadblocks</h3> \n<p>Here, you’ll want to outline any roadblocks, such as limited resources or a custom website, that might prevent certain vendors from successfully completing the project. This allows you to eliminate unsatisfactory bidders, and it will also help you determine which vendors have the skills and expertise to tackle those challenges.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>9. Budget</h3> \n<p>Any vendor needs to know how much you’re able to pay them for their services before they’ll move forward with their bid.</p> \n<h2><strong>RFP Sample</strong></h2> \n<p>The above elements might manifest on the page in a number of ways. For example, here is an RFP sample from TemplateLab.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/rfp-sample-templatelab.jpg?width=485&amp;name=rfp-sample-templatelab.jpg\" alt=\"rfp sample templatelab with tables and red headings\" width=\"485\" style=\"width: 485px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"><a href=\"https://templatelab.com/request-for-proposal/\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Image Source&nbsp;</span></em></a></img></p> \n<p>Now that you understand the elements of an RFP , you can build your own template and then fill it out so that you can start accepting bids.

This kicks off their buyer’s journey.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/buyers-journey-3-stages.jpg?width=600&amp;name=buyers-journey-3-stages.jpg\" alt=\"buyer's journey showing progression through the awareness stage, consideration stage, and decision stage\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<p>When you don't have a complete understanding your audience, a disconnect is created between your business and your potential customers. For content marketers, this usually means you're putting out content that your readers don't really relate with, which can cause you to lose them.</p> \n<p>As is the case in all marketing disciplines, it’s <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33491/Everything-Marketers-Need-to-Research-Create-Detailed-Buyer-Personas-Template.aspx#sm.0000o5c3iom8gdkipdw2l236rj19q\">important to understand your audience</a>:&nbsp;how they think, the answers they seek, and the path they tend to take to find a solution. From that research, you can <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-marketing-plan\">begin crafting a documented content strategy</a> that maps your content to the various stages of the buyer's journey.</p> \n<p>Developing the buyer’s journey for your business is the first step to creating content that resonates with your buyer and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33711/The-Steps-You-Need-to-Define-the-Stages-of-Your-Sales-Marketing-Funnel.aspx?&amp;_ga=2.183949606.1430126461.1594683485-303082430.1584047107#sm.0000o5c3iom8gdkipdw2l236rj19q\">building out your marketing funnel</a> so that you can meet them at each stage of their journey.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>What Is a Marketing Funnel?&nbsp;</h2> \n<p>A marketing funnel — more commonly known as a sales funnel since its output is revenue — describes the different stages a customer goes through leading up to their purchase, from looking at your website for the first time and subscribing to your email list to reading your emails and talking to a sales associate.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/attract-engage-delight.jpg?width=787&amp;name=attract-engage-delight.jpg\" alt=\"illustration of marketing funnel with marketing at the top, sales in the middle, and customers at the end. Also shows corresponds to the attract, engage, and delight strategy.\" width=\"787\" style=\"width: 787px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<p>How the funnel works is simple. The top of the funnel indicates they are further away from a purchasing decision while those who make it to the bottom of the funnel are closer to a purchasing decision.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Often, it’s a marketer’s job to <strong>attract</strong> your buyer persona in the early stages of their journey and hand off qualified prospects to the sales team to <strong>engage</strong> them. Once they become a customer, your service team <strong>delights</strong> them so that they buy from you again and again and tell all their friends.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The funnel is a useful tool when used in the context of the buyer’s journey. However, keep in mind that the funnel has one issue: It puts customers as the output. At <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QC2SHjBiag\">INBOUND 18</a>, HubSpot officially <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/our-flywheel\">retires the funnel in favor of the flywheel</a>.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Funnel-To-Flywheel-Morph.gif?width=450&amp;name=Funnel-To-Flywheel-Morph.gif\" alt=\"an animation of the funnel morphing into a flywheel, a circle with marketing, sales, and service surrounded by growth (or customers) at the center\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">The result puts customers at the center, which creates a more unified and less linear approach to all your marketing, sales, and service activities.</img></p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Flywheel-Continuous-Spin.gif?width=400&amp;name=Flywheel-Continuous-Spin.gif\" alt=\"flywheel with attract, engage, and delight, spinning and feeding into each other as it shows strangers becoming prospects, customers, and promoters\" width=\"400\" style=\"width: 400px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<h3>Marketing Funnel Stages</h3> \n<p>Even so, the funnel is still a good starting point before you begin moving to your flywheel strategy.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>All you have to do take the buyer’s journey and ask the question: “How do we attract and engage this person so they become a customer?”&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Whether you subscribe to the funnel or the flywheel methodology, earning business from your prospects comes down to three simple things:&nbsp;</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Attracting strangers</li> \n <li>Engaging prospects</li> \n <li>Delighting customers</li> \n</ul> \n<p>As you create create content that performs these functions, you'll consider the stage they're at in their journey and the best channels to put the content in front of them.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The internet has made it easier for marketers (and salespeople) to engage customers at the various stages of their journey&nbsp;using content marketing.&nbsp;That’s one of the main reasons that<strong><a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/state-of-marketing\"> 60% of marketers</a> consider content as 'very important' or 'extremely important' to their overall strategy.</strong></p> \n<p>However, it can be challenging to create the right content, for the right people, at the right time.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>Marketing Channels for Each Stage of the Funnel</h2> \n<p>Building a content strategy starts with identifying the channels in which you’ll reach your audience.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/marketing-channels-per-stage.jpg?width=600&amp;name=marketing-channels-per-stage.jpg\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" alt=\"marketing channels for each stage of your strategy: attract, engage, delight\" /></p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>Marketing Channels for the Attract Stage</h3> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/attract-stage.jpg?width=600&amp;name=attract-stage.jpg\" alt=\"Attract Stage: The stage of the inbound methodology where you use your expertise to create content and conversations that start meaningful relationships with the right people.\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">Remember, a large majority of your prospects may even be in the awareness stage of their buyer’s journey when you begin to attract them. That means your goal is to solve for their pains/problems by creating content they can easily discover and consume.</img></p> \n<p>At this point, a buyer is trying to solve problems, get an answer, or meet a need. They’re looking for top-level educational content to help direct them to a solution, like blog posts, social content, and ebooks.&nbsp;Their&nbsp;value as a lead is low because there’s no guarantee that they’ll buy from you. But those who find your content helpful and interesting may journey on to the middle of the funnel.</p> \n<p>The ideal channels for your attract stage may include:&nbsp;</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Blogging</li> \n <li>Search Engine Marketing</li> \n <li>Social Media Marketing</li> \n</ul> \n<a></a> \n<h3>Marketing Channels for the Engage Stage</h3> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/engage-stage.jpg?width=600&amp;name=engage-stage.jpg\" alt=\"Engage Stage: The stage of the inbound methodology where you build lasting relationships with people by providing insights and solutions that align with their pain points and goals\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<p>When someone moves into the middle of your funnel, it means you’ve captured their attention. They know they have a problem that has to be solved, and now they’re trying to discover the best solution. The need for a future purchase commitment creeps up as they’re evaluation their options.</p> \n<p>While the top of the funnel is designed to educate a prospect, this is the stage where you want to show why your solutions in particular are the best fit.</p> \n<p>(You also want to help people determine if they're <em>not&nbsp;</em>a good fit, which will be very important later for healthy customer retention. If you convince customers to buy who aren't a good fit for your business in the long run, you could be shooting yourself in the foot in the form of high churn rate later.)</p> \n<p>The middle of the funnel is typically a point of extended engagement where you’re nurturing a lead, building a relationship, and establishing trust between the audience and your brand.</p> \n<p>The ideal channels for your engage stage may include:&nbsp;</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Email Marketing</li> \n <li>Retargeting/Remarketing</li> \n <li>Social Media</li> \n</ul> \n<p>You also need to engage prospects at the bottom of your funnel.</p> \n<p>The bottom of the funnel is where someone is making the actual purchase decision. They're ready to&nbsp;buy, but that&nbsp;still doesn’t guarantee that they’re going to buy from <em>you.</em> That’s the last choice they have to make: Where do they get the solution they’re seeking?</p> \n<p>In most cases, leads at the bottom of your funnel just need that final nudge and that compelling call-to-action to get them to make a purchase decision. The right offer and content at this stage can have a dramatic impact on lifting your conversions.</p> \n<p>You might also consider sales outreach to engage qualified prospects and continue to engage them through personalization and contextual marketing.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>Marketing Channels for the Delight Stage</h3> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/delight-stage.jpg?width=600&amp;name=delight-stage.jpg\" alt=\"Delight Stage: The stage of the inbound methodology where you provide an outstanding experience that adds real value, and empowers people to reach their goals and become promoters of your company.\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<p>Marketing shouldn’t stop once someone becomes a customer. Cultivating a relationship with your customer beyond the sale can lead to higher customer lifetime value as well as word-of-mouth referrals and more.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The key here is to go above and beyond their expectations and provide a customer experience that’s easy and frictionless.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The ideal channels for your delight stage may include:&nbsp;</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Email Marketing</li> \n <li>Retargeting/Remarketing</li> \n <li>Self-Service Channels Such as Knowledge Bases</li> \n <li>Live Chat and Chatbots for Service</li> \n <li>Loyalty Programs</li> \n</ul> \n<p>On the surface, this process seems really linear, but you can also target multiple stages of the buyer’s journey across channels.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>For example, you may still be able to attract someone in the consideration stage or delight someone who isn’t a customer yet. Your knowledge base might convince someone in the consideration stage to buy since they perceive that you have great service, or someone in the awareness stage could engage your chatbot to find the content they need.</p> \n<p>One of the joys of content marketing is thinking outside the box.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>Creating Content for Each Stage of the Buyer's Journey</h2> \n<p>Once you have an idea of who your buyer persona is and what channels will work best for your business, you can begin creating content for your buyer at different stages and tailor that content per channel.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Doing so can help you <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/customer-journey-map-template\">map your content to the relevant stages of the buyer’s journey</a> to make your funnel.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Top of the Funnel:</strong>&nbsp;The \"awareness\" stage, where people looking for answers, resources, education, research data, opinions, and insight.</li> \n <li><strong>Middle of the Funnel:&nbsp;</strong>The \"evaluation\" stage, where people are doing heavy research on whether or not your product or service is a good fit for them.</li> \n <li><strong>Bottom of the Funnel:</strong>&nbsp;The \"purchase\" stage, where people are figuring out exactly what it would take to become a customer.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Your funnel may look very different depending on factors like your industry, business model, product, pricing, and audience.&nbsp;Some B2C customers, for example, spend very little time in the middle of the funnel compared to B2B customers that require far more nurturing, engagement, and relationship development before a purchase is made. A $50 pair of sneakers, for instance, requires a lot less handholding when it comes to making purchase decisions than a $10,000 business software investment.</p> \n<h2>Content Ideas for Each Stage of the Buyer's Journey</h2> \n<p>Because audiences can vary so widely based on industry and intent, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33491/Everything-Marketers-Need-to-Research-Create-Detailed-Buyer-Personas-Template.aspx\">persona research is of the utmost importance</a>. Only by understanding their unique process for awareness and evaluation will you be able to create a truly effective content marketing strategy, packed with custom content that best supports their journey toward making a purchase.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/content-buyer-journey-stage.jpg?width=600&amp;name=content-buyer-journey-stage.jpg\" alt=\"content ideas for each stage of the buyer's journey: awareness, consideration, decision\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>Blog Post&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>A blog post is an ideal piece of content targeting the awareness stage. By targeting a pain, problem, or other topic your target audience wants to discover and then posting it to your website, you’re creating a brand asset that’s crawlable by Google and discoverable by search engine users. You can also promote your blog content across other channels.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/blog-post-example-ahrefs.jpg?width=600&amp;name=blog-post-example-ahrefs.jpg\" alt=\"blog post example from ahrefs's blog that reads 'how long should blog posts be?'\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://ahrefs.com/blog/blog-post-length/\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>Ahrefs is a great example of a brand that does blog content right. They include original data and informational advice to create long-form articles that serve their audience.</p> \n<h3>Social Media Post</h3> \n<p>Social media is a channel that can be used to promote your other content, and you can also create content specifically for the channel. According to <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/fact-sheet/social-media/\">Pew Research</a>, 72% of the public uses some form of social media, so it’s likely that your audience is native to this channel. Unlike blog posts, social media posts are likely shorter form, and <a href=\"https://www.oberlo.com/blog/video-marketing-statistics\">video consumption is also on the rise</a>.</p> \n<iframe style=\"margin: 0px auto; display: block;\" src=\"https://www.linkedin.com/embed/feed/update/urn:li:ugcPost:6672147901583642624\" width=\"504\" height=\"653\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n<p>In the above example, HubSpot Agency Partner <a href=\"https://www.yokellocal.com/\">Yokel Local</a> shares attractive customer marketing tips on the LinkedIn platform. SlideShare formats are popular on LinkedIn, so the content is created to be snackable with short-form take-aways.</p> \n<h3>Whitepaper&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>A whitepaper is an organization’s report or guide on a particular topic. Whitepapers are especially useful as downloadable offers when a reader wants to go more in-depth on a particular subject they’re reading about. For whitepapers, it’s important to provide information that can’t be found elsewhere so that your audience understands the value of the report and is compelled to get it.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/whitepaper-example-hubspot.jpg?width=518&amp;name=whitepaper-example-hubspot.jpg\" alt=\"whitepaper example from hubspot that reads: &quot;not another state of marketing report&quot;\" width=\"518\" style=\"width: 518px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/state-of-marketing\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>Every year, HubSpot publishes a survey on the state of marketing to provide helpful guidance based on thought leadership to marketers, sales professionals, and business owners. Inside, readers find statistics from a broad survey as well as industry experts’ opinions on what the data means and where the industry is going.</p> \n<h3>Checklist&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>For tasks that are complicated and have a lot of moving parts, individuals may simply want a blueprint that spells out what they’re supposed to do to achieve their end goal.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/checklist-example-opendoor.jpg?width=600&amp;name=checklist-example-opendoor.jpg\" alt=\"checklist example from opendoor that reads &quot;the essential checklist for first-time home buyers&quot;\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://www.opendoor.com/w/guides/checklist-for-first-time-home-buyers\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>Buying a home is a perfect example of this, and Opendoor meets their audience’s need by providing a handy checklist (in infographic form!) for the reader that spells out all the steps that need to be taken. The graphic is aesthetically pleasing and even allows room for a few tips along the way.</p> \n<h3>How-To Video&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>Sometimes, the best way to solve a pain or problem is to learn a new skill. Sure, a purchase of some kind may be required along the way, but the audience may need to become more informed about the problem and how to solve it. That’s where instructional video content comes in.</p> \n<div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"width: 100%; height: auto; position: relative; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; max-width: 534px; max-height: 300px; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\"> \n <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.18%; margin: 0;\"> \n  <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/FyOqoV90v58?autoplay=0&amp;fs=0&amp;iv_load_policy=3&amp;showinfo=0&amp;rel=0&amp;cc_load_policy=0&amp;start=0&amp;end=0&amp;origin=https://youtubeembedcode.com\" width=\"534\" height=\"300\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> \n </div> \n</div> \n<p>Whiteboard Fridays is a popular video series by <a href=\"https://moz.com/\">Moz</a> where SEO principles are broken down to the audience in easy-to-understand language and visuals. Moz knows that SEO is a difficult subject and aims to make it accessible to their viewers.</p> \n<h3>Kit or Tool&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>Informational content provided to a broader audience may not always be enough for your buyer persona to make a decision or take action of some kind. In some cases, they may require a little more utility or personalization. That’s why kits and tools are a great piece of content to create to help the reader along their path to purchase.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/tool-example-nerdwallet.jpg?width=600&amp;name=tool-example-nerdwallet.jpg\" alt=\"tool example from nerdwallet that reads &quot;the 50/30/20 budget&quot; and is a budget calculator\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/finance/nerdwallet-budget-calculator\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>Nerdwallet creates content around several financial topics, budgeting being one of them. It can be difficult to create a budget, though, so they developed a calculator that allows the user to provide their own numbers in order to receive a customized recommendation.</p> \n<h3>Ebook or Tip Sheet&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>Similar to whitepapers, ebooks and tip sheets are great options for downloadable content. In contrast, they tend to be shorter form and more actionable.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/tip-sheet-example-coschedule.jpg?width=600&amp;name=tip-sheet-example-coschedule.jpg\" alt=\"tip sheet example from coschedule that reads &quot;180+ power words for writing emotional headlines&quot;\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<p style=\"font-size: 12px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/emotional-headlines/\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>CoSchedule combines a few tactics by promoting their headline analyzer tool with a <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/emotional-headlines/\">blog post about writing great headlines that drive traffic</a>. On that blog post, they include a great <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/emotional-headlines/\">tip sheet of powerful words</a> to include in headlines if you want to catch a reader’s attention.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>Educational Webinar&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>A webinar is a web seminar where information is typically provided through video. A webinar can be prerecorded or streamed live, and this opens up tons of possibilities to disseminate information to an audience who wants more visual and auditory content.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/webinar-example-semrush.jpg?width=600&amp;name=webinar-example-semrush.jpg\" alt=\"semrush's webinar page on their website\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://www.semrush.com/webinars/\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>SEMrush makes webinars a key part of their content marketing strategy, often running a valuable topic multiple times to get more mileage out of the content.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>Product Comparison Guides</h3> \n<p>In the consideration stage, the buyer persona is still considering solutions to their pain or problem. For this reason, product comparisons are a great way to help them make a decision.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/comparison-example-verwell-fit.jpg?width=600&amp;name=comparison-example-verwell-fit.jpg\" alt=\"comparison example from verywell fit that reads &quot;pros and cons of hiit training&quot;\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://www.verywellfit.com/is-hiit-training-or-steady-state-cardio-better-4126506\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>Verywell Fit provides such a comparison to help their readers choose between high-intensity workouts vs. steady-state cardio, providing the pros and cons and use cases for each.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>Case Study</h3> \n<p>A case study can be used in both the consideration stage and the decision stage simultaneously by convincing the reader that the solution works by establishing that the provider achieves results for their clients by administering the solution. A good case study will appeal to the emotions and logic of the persona by providing detailed information and quantitative data on the final solution.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/case-study-example-bluleadz.jpg?width=600&amp;name=case-study-example-bluleadz.jpg\" alt=\"case study example from bluleadz that reads &quot;lead generation strategy lands 77 new clients for credit counseling agency&quot;\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://www.bluleadz.com/case-studies/credit-canada-new-content-offer\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>HubSpot Partner Agency <a href=\"https://www.bluleadz.com/\">Blueleadz</a> does this by telling a story about their client and the problems they had while providing a detailed account of how they solved it.</p> \n<h3>Free Sample&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>A free sample is another example of content or an offer that overlaps between buyer’s journey stages. Consider this: An individual wants to paint the inside of their home, but they don’t know what color.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>As they consider which color (the solution), they pick up paint chip cards from their hardware store. These cards are created by a provider based on their individual solution. When the individual falls in love with a color, they already know who the provider is that makes it.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/free-sample-example-4colorprint.jpg?width=600&amp;name=free-sample-example-4colorprint.jpg\" alt=\"free sample example from 4colorprint that depicts a pack of sample business cards\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<p style=\"font-size: 12px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4colorprint.com/sample-request.php\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>SILKCARDS taps into this buying behavior by offering samples of their unique printing methods on the content that they create. They know that their business is tactile, and digital content alone is not enough to close a deal. Once their prospective customer holds the sample in their hands, other business cards are put to shame.&nbsp;</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>Free Trial or Live Demo</h3> \n<p>What better way to know if you want to purchase a product than take it for a spin? Car dealerships have been using the “test drive” tactic for years because it works. If the product itself checks all the boxes the buyer has, all the sales team has to do is handle their objections and make the close.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/free-trial-example-hellosign.jpg?width=600&amp;name=free-trial-example-hellosign.jpg\" alt=\"free trial example from hellosign that reads &quot;unlimited signature requests with no hidden fees&quot; and has four pricing tiers, one that's free and two that offer free trials\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<p style=\"font-size: 12px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://app.hellosign.com/info/pricing\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>Hellosign does this well. Though they have a free option with limitations, they know that the key to getting clients into their larger tiers is by offering a free trial upfront. Their pricing page sets the prospect’s expectations and points them to the free trial.</p> \n<h3>Consultation Offer&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>A consultation is another example of providing just a little bit of service in exchange for the opportunity to close the sale. The best consultation offers reduce the anxiety of entering into a sales conversation by promising something concrete they can walk away with (a strategy or actionable advice) in exchange for their time.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/consultation-offer-blkbld-co.jpg?width=600&amp;name=consultation-offer-blkbld-co.jpg\" alt=\"consultation offer from blkbld &amp; co that reads 'for our initial consultation, we will discuss what you are looking to do, your budget, my marketing plans you can execute &amp; lastly the next steps&quot;\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<p style=\"font-size: 12px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blkbld.lpages.co/free-consultation/\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>Blk Bld &amp; Co.’s consultation offer is a great example because it reduces the friction of scheduling a consultation. By removing friction, this organization increases the chances of conversion.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>Coupon</h3> \n<p>A coupon appeals to a fear of missing out (FOMO) mindset. By reducing the price by a certain amount, a coupon is handing a price objection while convincing the prospect that they’re leaving money on the table if they don’t use the coupon. This inertia enough to win the prospect’s business.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/coupon-example-fragrant-jewels.jpg?width=500&amp;name=coupon-example-fragrant-jewels.jpg\" alt=\"coupon example from fragrant jewels in a &quot;spin-to-win&quot; style popup format\" width=\"500\" style=\"width: 500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://www.fragrantjewels.com/\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>Fragrant Jewels does this well by gamifying their coupons. By spinning the wheel, the website visitors have the chance to get a coupon before checking out the products. They’ll likely be evaluating the products that are a good deal with the coupon they won.</p> \n<p>In addition to decision stage content, you should also create content to delight your existing customers. This may include FAQ and knowledge base content to make the customer experience easier, coupons for the opportunity to upsell, and additional educative content that deepens their understanding of a topic.</p> \n<h2>Mapping Content Across All Stages of the Funnel and Buying Cycle</h2> \n<p>Every business has a unique sales funnel, sculpted and designed around their buyer’s unique journey.&nbsp;It’s a recipe that can’t necessarily be replicated from one business to another.&nbsp;When creating your own buyer's journey, there are a number of factors specific&nbsp;to your business to take into consideration.</p> \n<p>That said, the general approach remains the same: Understand your audience, develop your funnel around your industry and audience intent, and create a documented content marketing strategy that maps custom content specifically to each phase of their journey through the funnel.</p> \n<p>Do it well, and this process will have the greatest possible impact on your customer relationships, as well as the greatest possible lift in your overall conversions.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p> \n<p><em>Editor's note: This post was originally published in August 2016 and has

these days, you can’t swing an enthusiastic micro-influencer without hitting someone who’s talking about video content. And it’s not without merit. A <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/news-trends/content-trends-preferences\">recent HubSpot study</a> revealed 54% of consumers want to see more video content from brands and businesses they support.</p> \n<p>With video marketers earning <a href=\"https://optinmonster.com/video-marketing-statistics-what-you-must-know/\">66% more qualified leads</a> per year and a 54% increase in brand awareness, it’s clear video marketing is the future and product demo videos are a lucrative path forward.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>In fact, <a href=\"https://www.wyzowl.com/video-marketing-statistics-2018/\">72% of people</a> would rather use video to learn about a product or service. There are many different types of product demo videos, so I’m sharing a few of my favorites below, along with tips on how to get started on your own product demo video.</p> \n<p>Want to skip straight to the videos? <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/demo-video#demo-video-examples\">Click here</a>.</p> \n<h3>1. Identify the goal</h3> \n<p>Purchases? Subscriptions? Education? Brand awareness? Decide what your video is trying to achieve and what you want the viewer to walk away with. What action do you hope the viewer takes after watching your video, and what business need does it fulfill? For example, “<em>After watching our product demo video, we hope the viewer submits a demo request form</em>.”</p> \n<h3>2. Determine your audience</h3> \n<p>Has the audience for this video purchased with you before? Are you introducing a new product or feature to them? Or is this video reaching people who have never heard of you? What will this audience be concerned with? How long will they want to watch? What buyer persona will you be gearing this video for?</p> \n<p>All of these are important questions to answer. For example, let’s say you’re introducing software that regulates the temperature of various areas in your office. The audience for your video might be harried office managers who are constantly fielding requests to turn the temperature up or down. They’re concerned with keeping their colleagues comfortable without breaking the bank on electricity costs.</p> \n<h3>3. Set a budget (and a timeline)</h3> \n<p>Do you have $7000 or $80,000 to make this product demo video? Identify your budget so you know how to proceed. This is also the time to set expectations. If you have a $500 budget, you’re not going to come out with a video on par with Apple’s latest release -- and that’s alright.</p> \n<p>Oh, and don’t forget to outline when you need this video to be completed. Even the biggest budgets can run up against roadblocks, if the timeline is too limited.</p> \n<h3>4. Decide between in-house or agency</h3> \n<p>This decision will likely be dependent on your budget. If you have a lot to work with, interview agencies who can give you quotes and creative pitches for your project.</p> \n<p>If you have a small budget, don’t let that dissuade you from creating a video using your iPhone. You can also record a video of your computer screen while moving through your platform. Work with what you have and be proud of whatever you create.</p> \n<h3>5. Structure your video</h3> \n<p>Will you tell a story? Highlight pain points? Use text or visuals only? Decide how you want to communicate your goal and how you’ll bring it to life.</p> \n<p>If you’re working with a creative agency or freelance videographer, they may help you define the structure. If you’re going it alone, use videos like the ones we’ve listed below to inspire you and define which format will work best for your product and goals.</p> \n<h3>6. Choose between animation and live-action</h3> \n<p>Animation can sometimes be a little cheaper than live-action video. Work within your budget and skill level, and be honest about which option best highlights what your product can do and the scope your project requires.</p> \n<h3>7. Write a script</h3> \n<p>The script is a crucial part of your video. It defines the tone, pace, and message. Start with a project brief, move on to an outline, and navigate your script, section by section, making sure it speaks to the goals you’ve previously outlined.</p> \n<p>Call out opportunities for B-roll throughout, and always conduct a verbal run-through before getting behind the camera.</p> \n<p>For more tips and a video script template, check out this blog post and accompanying video on <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-write-a-video-script-ht?_ga=2.204163794.394907747.1559842484-112379962.1552485402\">how to write a video script</a>.</p> \n<h3>8. Create a marketing plan</h3> \n<p>Once you’ve shot, edited, and finalized your video, it’s time to decide how you’ll <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/video-distribution-checklist?_ga=2.204163794.394907747.1559842484-112379962.1552485402\">share it with your audience</a>. YouTube, your website or campaign landing pages, and special email campaigns are all great channels for distribution.</p> \n<p>But don’t overlook less obvious opportunities, like including your video in your email signature, sharing it in partner blog posts, and incorporating it into your sales team’s pitches.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>Product Demo Video Examples</h2> \n<h3>1. Beauty Bakerie</h3> \n<p>This pleasant demo from <a href=\"https://www.beautybakerie.com/\">Beauty Bakerie</a>'s CEO and Co-Founder Cashmere Nicole Carillo highlights the brand's new concealer, foundation and makeup setting mist. Cashmere begins the demo with no makeup on to show her fans what the makeup will look like realistically as she puts it on her face.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>While the demo allows viewers to see what the products will look like in real life, Cashmere also gives instructions on how to use it so they'll also know just how easy it is to add to their daily beauty routine.</p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"width: 100%; height: auto; position: relative; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; max-width: 560px; max-height: 315px; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\"> \n <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 0;\"> \n  <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/oBFN9FwcpPw\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n </div> \n</div> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>2. Airtable</h3> \n<p>This classic product demo video uses animation and the Airtable product to show users exactly who can use their product and how they can benefit from it. The video demonstrates several different use cases, taking a broad, top-of-the-funnel approach that will attract the masses.</p> \n<p>They also do something else incredibly smart. As seconds tick by and viewers hypothetically click out of the video, the information shared gets more into the weeds sharing specific tactics and features. Airtable knows if someone has stuck around over one minute into their demo video, this is likely a qualified lead who wants to learn more.</p> \n<div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"float: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 100%; height: auto; position: relative; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; max-width: 560px; max-height: 315px; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto;\"> \n <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 0;\"> \n  <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/r0lsyTaAuJE\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n </div> \n</div> \n<h3>3. Zendesk Sunshine</h3> \n<p>Zendesk leads with pain points in their product demo video. “Customer relationships are complicated … made up of fragmented pieces of what you know about your customers … it’s kind of all over the place,” a narrator explains. But Zendesk gets it. “What seems like chaos is actually everything you want.”</p> \n<p>The viewer immediately feels like Zendesk understands them. It’s a full 50 seconds into the video before Zendesk even introduces a solution. We never actually see the platform at work, but that’s not really the goal of this video.</p> \n<div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"float: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 100%; height: auto; position: relative; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; max-width: 560px; max-height: 315px; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto;\"> \n <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 0;\"> \n  <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/buRG1eGuPIs\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n </div> \n</div> \n<h3>4. SurveyMonkey</h3> \n<p>At nearly two-minutes long, this is a lengthy product demo video. But it packs a powerful punch with text-based benefits and features, and a walk-through of the product interface.</p> \n<p>Viewers see just how easy it is to send a survey using SurveyMonkey. They even see how it integrates with other platforms like Slack. This is a workhorse of a demo video, but the viewer witnesses how SurveyMonkey can integrate into their daily workflow -- and how easy the product is to use, from sign-in to send.</p> \n<div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"float: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 100%; height: auto; position: relative; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; max-width: 560px; max-height: 315px; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto;\"> \n <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 0;\"> \n  <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PnET-g7NTao\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n </div> \n</div> \n<h3>5. Headspace</h3> \n<p>Is there anything harder to sell on the internet than meditation? Headspace makes it seem easy with their modern, relatable animated product demo video.</p> \n<p>They offer a “healthier, happier life” and show you how the app works for a variety of users with differing goals and time. It’s an inclusive video that communicates a lot without overwhelming the viewer.</p> \n<div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"float: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 100%; height: auto; position: relative; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; max-width: 560px; max-height: 315px; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto;\"> \n <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 0;\"> \n  <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CS76mK58urI\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n </div> \n</div> \n<h3>6. Esusu Financial</h3> \n<p>Esusu, an app created by <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/elisabethbrier/2020/06/05/75-black-owned-businesses-to-support/#1f8f8b563814\">Forbes 30 Under 30 social entrepreneurs Abbey Wemimo and Samir Goel</a>, aims to help people in marginalized locations with financial planning. The demo created by the company gives viewers a look inside Esusu;s platform and the tools it has to offer.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Specifically, this demo walks through how families can use the platform together to build each member's credit, save funds together, or send funds to each other.</p> \n<div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"width: 100%; height: auto; position: relative; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; max-width: 560px; max-height: 315px; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\"> \n <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 0;\"> \n  <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/3xFnN6t7pwU\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n </div> \n</div> \n<p>One great thing about the intro above is that it establishes a pain point by asking the audience if they've ever dealt with bad credit or poor savings. Then, it highlights exactly how Esusu can help them.</p> \n<p>This demo is also a great example of how a quick and simple tour of an app can show potential users exactly what they need to know about navigating and using this type of financial planning app.</p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>7. Apple’s iPhone XS, XS Max, and XR</h3> \n<p>This glossy product video introduces the new iPhone XR by showing what it can do. Simple text alerts the viewer to the features this new phone possesses (e.g., “liquid retina,” “face ID,” and “water resistant”), and the benefits are communicated through the vivid visuals.</p> \n<p>The goal of this product demo is to \"wow\" rather than educate, and that’s exactly what it does.</p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"width: 100%; height: auto; position: relative; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; max-width: 560px; max-height: 315px; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\"> \n <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 0;\"> \n  <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/9m_K2Yg7wGQ\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n </div> \n</div> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>8. Slack</h3> \n<p>Slack uses this brightly hued video to break down a common misconception about their platform: that it’s only for sending private messages. They walk viewers through how teams can communicate using their interface.</p> \n<p>“It’s way more than just a place to talk,” explains the actor, “We keep all of our files here too.” The video is feature-heavy, but the actor chimes in with how those features translate into benefits as he walks viewers through a demonstration of Slack. A simple “Get started with Slack, today” closes out this informative video.</p> \n<div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"float: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 100%; height: auto; position: relative; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; max-width: 560px; max-height: 315px; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto;\"> \n <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 0;\"> \n  <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6c7_TpPUpL0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n </div> \n</div> \n<h3>9. The Origins of Nike Free</h3> \n<p>This product demo tells the origin story of the Nike Free running shoes. The shoe creators share a bit about how the shoe was designed and call out benefits like, “More natural movement” and “Nice, modern evolution.” A simple tagline at the end reads, “Engineered for modern motion.”</p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"width: 100%; height: auto; position: relative; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; max-width: 560px; max-height: 315px; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\"> \n <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 0;\"> \n  <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/BITz7GEqA8s\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n </div> \n</div> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>10. Duolingo</h3> \n<p>Duolingo kicks things off with social proof. “Far and away the best free language-learning app,” says The Wall Street Journal. What follows is a description of how the platform works, backed with more data on how effective it really is.</p> \n<p>If you want to prove that your product works, sometimes facts are more alluring than a demo of the product itself.</p> \n<div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"float: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 100%; height: auto; position: relative; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; max-width: 560px; max-height: 315px; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto;\"> \n <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 0;\"> \n  <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SUz6oBiRlxk\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n </div> \n</div> \n<h3>11. IKEA Place</h3> \n<p>There’s nothing wrong with stating your purpose up front. “Hey, IKEA would like everyone to know about Place, our new augmented reality app,” explains this demo video. What follows is a demonstration of the app, and a video montage of people struggling to design and furnish new spaces. “We want to make it easier for people everywhere to imagine a better place,” the narrator explains. That’s exactly what this video demo does.</p> \n<div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"float: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 100%; height: auto; position: relative; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; max-width: 560px; max-height: 315px; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto;\"> \n <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 0;\"> \n  <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/UudV1VdFtuQ\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n </div> \n</div> \n<h3>12. NoseFrida</h3> \n<p>Your baby is cute, until she’s not. The narrator explains what happens to a baby’s nose when they’re sick -- and why your baby gets fussy. Immediately, he’s identified the viewer’s pain points and explained the problem with NoseFrida’s competitors.</p> \n<p>The narrator begins to explain how to use the NoseFrida -- a device that allows parents to physically suck snot out of their baby’s nose and effectively ruins your days of carefree milkshake sipping forever (take it from me).</p> \n<p>It’s here that the company does something brilliant. They know their customer’s biggest purchasing block is the gross-out factor this product elicits, so they confront it head on. “Breathe easy, we know what you’re thinking.”</p> \n<p>The narrator then explains how NoseFrida is designed to be hygienic and safe. Know your product has a big red flag for customers? Try addressing it bravely, like NoseFrida does, instead of tip-toeing around the elephant in the room.</p> \n<div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"float: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 100%; height: auto; position: relative; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; max-width: 560px; max-height: 315px; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto;\"> \n <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 0;\"> \n  <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/UsLFKfGuioE\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n </div> \n</div> \n<h3>13. Bluprint</h3> \n<p>How do you get people to part with their most valuable asset: their free time? Online learning platform Bluprint does just that. They overcome viewer objections early on. Think you don’t have time? “There’s always a way to get your creative fix,” the narrator explains.</p> \n<p>The video takes an aspirational lens, showing people cooking, painting, and dancing. It ends with a call to action, “What will you do today?” Bluprint knows what they’re up against, and their demo video is a strong rebuttal against inactivity.</p> \n<div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"float: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 100%; height: auto; position: relative; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; max-width: 560px; max-height: 315px; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto;\"> \n <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 0;\"> \n  <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BMat3J64OTg\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n </div> \n</div> \n<h3>14. Sphero</h3> \n<p>Are you known for one product but want to introduce another? Sphero knows a little about that. A few years ago, they created a robot called BB-8 for a little-known movie called <em>Star Wars: The Force Awakens</em>. Lucky for them, I hear that panned out.</p> \n<p>In a Kickstarter video for their newest robot, they begin by featuring the iconic BB-8 robot that skyrocketed their success. Once the viewer knows who they are, they present their new robot: The Sphero RVR.</p> \n<p>The rest of the video features the robot’s engineers speaking about what their new creation does and why it’s special. We believe them, because they’ve tethered this new creation to their past authority.</p> \n<div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"float: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 100%; height: auto; position: relative; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; max-width: 560px; max-height: 315px; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto;\"> \n <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 0;\"> \n  <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ip28n_prmbY\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n </div> \n</div> \n<h3>15. Ring Door View Cam</h3> \n<p>This is another great example of showing instead of telling viewers what your product can do. The video shows everyday people using Ring’s Door View Cam in a variety of ways. We see them use the mobile interface, benefit from the speaker, and avoid danger using the camera.</p> \n<div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"float: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 100%; height: auto; position: relative; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; max-width: 560px; max-height: 315px; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto;\"> \n <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 0;\"> \n  <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WJ-iMF5hKgk\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n </div> \n</div> \n<h3>16. Lime</h3> \n<p>Text that reads, “How to Lime” kicks this video off and tells viewers exactly what to expect. We see a step-by-step demonstration of how to use Lime, their safety recommendations, and some basics on their mobile app.</p> \n<div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"float: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 100%; height: auto; position: relative; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; max-width: 560px; max-height: 315px; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto;\"> \n <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 0;\"> \n  <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zOMYOBBRtM8\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n </div> \n</div> \n<h3>17. Peloton</h3> \n<p>This product video begins with an origin story of the Peloton bicycle and quickly moves to the benefits (i.e., you can ride it in your bedroom without waking your partner). Before you know it, the video is speaking to viewer pain points, “One of the challenges with boutique fitness is that it can be inconvenient.” They solution? Peloton.</p> \n<p>Thousands of classes, experienced instructors, community, and ease of use. Close-ups of the machine in use highlights certain features, but what this video demonstrates most is the experience you’ll have using Peloton. “This is what I’ve been missing,” says one video participant. I can’t help but think that’s the primary goal the makers of this video had for their viewers.</p> \n<div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"float: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 100%; height: auto; position: relative; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; max-width: 560px; max-height: 315px; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto;\"> \n <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 0;\"> \n  <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nY5NvoZDKEQ\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n </div> \n</div> \n<h3>18. Zoom</h3> \n<p>This is a classic example of a product demo video. A solid, feature-heavy script immediately jumps into how professionals can use and benefit from Zoom. The viewer sees the product being used as they listen to how it works, and they’re left with a clear picture of what Zoom can offer them.</p> \n<div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"float: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 100%; height: auto; position: relative; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; max-width: 560px; max-height: 315px; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto;\"> \n <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 0;\"> \n  <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VnyitUU4DUY\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n </div> \n</div> \n<h3>19. Gusto</h3> \n<p>I’ve saved the most comprehensive product demo video for last. This example, from HR software provider Gusto, clocks in at an impressive five minutes and fifty-six seconds.</p> \n<p>What follows is a careful walk-through of the product, it’s benefits, and how to pick the perfect plan.</p> \n<p>Viewers who make it to the end likely signal to Gusto that they’re ready to speak with a salesperson. This video probably works best for buyers further along in the buyer’s journey.

But most (and sometimes all) of these community-building measures are superficial, or even irrelevant, to what constitutes <em>real</em> community.</p> \n<p>We call the resulting so-called communities mirage communities: groups that organizations may label as communities, but that a trained eye can recognize are not.</p> \n<p>There are, however, a growing number of organizations that take the need for community far more seriously. These organizations invest in effective community principles, and they're rewarded with breakthrough innovation, critical feedback, brand loyalty, and employee retention.</p> \n<p>But these rewards don't appear magically. They require a special investment.</p> \n<p>So, how do some of today's most successful companies do it? Let's explore how Google, Twitch, and Sephora implement authentic community-building strategies, and how your own company can, too.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h3 style=\"font-weight: normal;\">1. Google invests in Labs.</h3> \n<p>At Google, community success comes in the form of collaborative groups, or what Google calls \"Labs.\"</p> \n<p>Each Google Lab brings together approximately 100 thought leaders, in specific industries, to tackle some of today's most pressing issues. Google Labs foster mutual respect and concern among members, which spawn conversations, collaborations, and opportunities that were never possible before. It's part of what keeps Google at the top of every \"most innovative\" company list today.</p> \n<p>For example, <a href=\"https://talksat.withgoogle.com/talk/the-food-lab\"><span>Google's Food Lab</span></a> focuses on the production, purchase, and presentation of food. Its members take on top food challenges, from \"How do we move our culture to a plant-forward diet?\" to \"How do we eliminate waste in our food system?\"</p> \n<p>In turn, Google is lauded as a brand that inspires the food industry, while it refines (and reduces) its own monstrous spending on healthy employee food perks — which, at one point, cost <a href=\"http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/253760\"><span>nearly $72 million a year</span></a> at the main office \"Googleplex\" alone.</p> \n<h3 style=\"font-weight: normal;\">2. Twitch succeeds with local groups.</h3> \n<p>Twitch attracts over <a href=\"https://twitchtracker.com/statistics\">2 million people per month</a> to watch and livestream digital video broadcasts. Their approach is built on a two-sided marketplace: they need to attract broadcasters, as well as audience members. Local community groups help them succeed.</p> \n<p>Twitch has built a worldwide team to support over <a href=\"https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/community-meetups-powered-by-twitch?language=en_US\"><span>40 local, city-based groups</span></a>, each of which hosts real-life and virtual events that foster genuine friendships and deep relationships between local Twitch members. However, local groups (and their leaders) must demonstrate how well they can bring members together, first.</p> \n<p>These local groups allow Twitch to transform online interactions — which can often feel transactional — into connections that have real meaning. Members return again and again to the brand, and recruit others to participate, because Twitch is a space where authentic emotional investments happen.</p> \n<h3 style=\"font-weight: normal;\">3. Sephora says \"yes\" to beauty enthusiasts.</h3> \n<p>Sephora — one of the largest beauty retailers in the world — has invested in building a <a href=\"https://www.sephora.com/community\"><span>makeup enthusiast community</span></a> that is both accessible on mobile devices and integrated <em>into</em> the shopping experience.</p> \n<p>Inside the community, members can discuss a variety of beauty products and methods, regardless of whether they're related to Sephora products or not. Within the community, Sephora enables members to follow interesting topics and connect with fellow members, keep up with trends and chat with brands, and score access to exclusive events.</p> \n<p>Community members can also gain access to beauty techniques and product information, engage with beauty company founders, and experience an affirming space with others who love the fun, play, and transformation of makeup.</p> \n<h3 style=\"font-weight: normal;\">What do these examples have in common?</h3> \n<p>Real communities are made up of relationships. Always. Relationships exist in the realm of personal experience, and although they may include transactions, they are never purely transactional. They also include some generosity — at least the kind where we help others without calculating the return on investment (ROI) for sending a card, answering a timely question, or holding a door open for a stranger coming in from the cold.</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>To build an effective brand community, you must reject the premise that everything an organization does or offers must generate profit or exist within a transaction. Instead, community-building efforts will help consumers see more long-term value in your brand.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>People don't commit to, feel safe in, or extend themselves for relationships that only serve a person (or brand) \"getting\" something as cheaply and easily as possible. We commit to relationships in which we believe that others care about our success, too.</p> \n<p>In a real community, members help one another become who they want to be. This can include sharing information, skills, hard-won lessons, and — very often — attentive friendship. When a brand can offer this to members (e.g., customers, users, staff, colleagues, or volunteers), something much richer and more rewarding can develop.</p> \n<h3>Three Tips for Building True Community</h3> \n<ol> \n <li><strong> Go beyond the transaction. </strong>Make sure you go far beyond building transactional relationships. It's not enough to offer coupons or simply invite someone to a virtual or in-person event.</li> \n <li><strong> Define how you're helping members. </strong>Articulate exactly how you're enriching the lives of community members — help them, not just your corporate goals.</li> \n <li><strong> Think small. </strong>Community happens in small experiences. Intentionally create what we call \"campfire experiences,\" which are intimate experiences where participants have proximity, permission, and time to connect with a small group.</li> \n</ol> \n<p></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fhow-brands-build-communities&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 04 Aug 2020 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":924,"bgimg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/brand-community.jpg#keepProtocol","linkMd5":"b161efe1e457ea51ea572de7a41f5e68","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn27@2020_2/2020/08/16/13-48-27-406_e1bc477bf7f1ec8a.webp","metaImg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/brand-community.jpg#keepProtocol","author":"Charles Vogl and Carrie Melissa Jones","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fhow-brands-build-communities&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx17/cdn44@2020_4/2020/08/16/13-48-28-599_a523a60997aa0333.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 21:48:25","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 21:48:25","title":"29 Free Resume Templates for Microsoft Word (& How to Make Your Own)","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/resume-templates-word","description":"<p>No matter what industry you work in (or your experience level in that industry), a plain, black-and-white resume written in Times New Roman font can actually weaken a job application.</p>  \n<p>But just because resumes have gotten more creative doesn’t mean you need special design software to make your application stand out.

Open Microsoft Word on your computer.</h3> \n<p>If you have Microsoft Word installed on your computer, open the program and let it load for a moment. There will be a couple of helpful options waiting for you on the first screen, specifically for resume creation.</p> \n<h3>2. Select either \"Basic Resume\" or \"Bold Resume\" from the template menu.</h3> \n<p>Once you've launched MS Word, a window of templates will appear. Scroll down until you see the template options designed for resumes -- there will be at least two of them. Double-click the one that suits your style and personal brand, but don't be too particular about design just yet ... you can customize these templates quite a bit.</p> \n<h3>3. Fill in your name and contact information at the top.</h3> \n<p>When your resume template opens, you'll see placeholder text for each line of your resume, starting with your first and last name at the top. Delete this header text and enter your name, as well as any contact information by which you want the recruiter to contact you.</p> \n<h3>4. Draft a brief summary of your experience and goals.</h3> \n<p>Use the first line below your name and contact info to describe who you are, what you do, and what you're looking for in your career.</p> \n<h3>5. Enter your school and latest education.</h3> \n<p>List any relevant degrees or certificates you received through schooling. You can safely exclude secondary education if you've graduated from an accredited college.</p> \n<h3>6. Describe each job you've held using the lines prompted on the template.</h3> \n<p>Your professional experience is frequently the most important section of your resume, so feel free to rank this section <em>above</em> your skills and education, depending on how many jobs you previously held.</p> \n<h3>7. List all relevant skills.</h3> \n<p>If you have experience in certain software, exercises, problem-solving, or management techniques, use them to populate your skills. Your resume's \"Skills\" section helps reveal what all of your previous jobs or related experiences have in common, based on what they taught you and what you provided them.</p> \n<h3>8. Describe any relevant accolades and accomplishments.</h3> \n<p>Finish out your resume with any personal accomplishments or accolades you think a hiring manager in your industry would appreciate. Although this section shouldn't include a <em>Most Improved</em> recognition from little league, for example, it should definitely include your <em>Marketer of the Month</em> award from your last position.</p> \n<h2><span>Free Resume Templates That Download in Word</span></h2> \n<p>Of course, if you’re already employed full-time, it’s hard to find the time to apply to a new job opportunity, let alone update your resume to reflect your qualifications.

Monogram Header Resume Template</h3> \n<p>We'll start with a simple one. This is a HubSpot exclusive resume template that is simple and clean with attractive monogrammed headers to call out each section of the resume. The rest of the design relies on a simple serif font for easy reading, which is a good thing considering that hiring managers only take <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90263970/your-resume-only-gets-7-4-seconds-to-make-an-impression-heres-how-to-stand-out\">7.4 seconds</a> to evaluate a resume.

Maroon Sidebar Resume Template</h3> \n<p>Pulling your more text-heavy information off to the side in an attractive color-blocked sidebar, this resume lets your experience stand for itself in white space at the top. It's also easily customizable with no difficult-to-manipulate tables or formatting. The sidebars are in movable text boxes that can even be removed if you wish.</p> \n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Download this template <a href=\"https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/53/blog-files/Maroon%20Sidebar%20Resume%20Template.docx\">here</a>.</h4> \n<p><a href=\"https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/53/blog-files/Maroon%20Sidebar%20Resume%20Template.docx\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Maroon%20Sidebar%20Resume.png?width=451&amp;name=Maroon%20Sidebar%20Resume.png\" alt=\"Maroon Sidebar Resume\" width=\"451\" style=\"width: 451px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></a></p> \n<h3>3. Centered Bar Resume Template</h3> \n<p>This resume takes on a different look than most resumes, centered around a single bar. This makes the resume more visually striking, which could draw attention as hiring managers are evaluating candidates. It also puts emphasis on the objective with your chronological experience supporting it underneath. All of this is in an attractive serif font that is elegant and classy.</p> \n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Download this template <a href=\"https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/53/blog-files/Centered%20Bar%20Resume%20Template.docx\">here</a>.</h4> \n<p><a href=\"https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/53/blog-files/Centered%20Bar%20Resume%20Template.docx\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Centered%20Bar%20Resume.png?width=451&amp;name=Centered%20Bar%20Resume.png\" alt=\"Centered Bar Resume\" width=\"451\" style=\"width: 451px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></a></p> \n<h3>4. Bold Serif Resume Template</h3> \n<p>Speaking of serif font, this resume puts forward an element of grace and formality with its font choices. It's perfect for individuals who are looking for more organic color than the ones more typically found in resumes, and the colors are also easily changed in Microsoft Word's theme settings. It also includes a skill-level bar, adding a nice visual touch to the template.</p> \n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Download this template <a href=\"https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/53/blog-files/Bold%20Serif%20Resume%20Template.docx\">here</a>.</h4> \n<p><a href=\"https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/53/blog-files/Bold%20Serif%20Resume%20Template.docx\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Bold%20Serif%20Resume.png?width=415&amp;name=Bold%20Serif%20Resume.png\" alt=\"Bold Serif Resume\" width=\"415\" style=\"width: 415px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></a></p> \n<h3>5. Modern Chronological Resume Template</h3> \n<p>This resume template is available from Microsoft itself, and it’s one of many free templates the company has prepared for those who depend on Microsoft Office tools to create content. Yes, it is written in Times New Roman — don’t freak out.</p> \n<p>Designs like this can borrow an old-school typeface and still impress recruiters with a clean layout and subtle use of color. You can also change the font if you wish (and the same goes for every template in our list).</p> \n<h4>Download this template <a href=\"https://templates.office.com/en-us/Chronological-Resume-Modern-design-TM16402488\">here</a>.</h4> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/modern%20chronological%20resume%20template-1.png?width=1500&amp;name=modern%20chronological%20resume%20template-1.png\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" alt=\"Modern chronological resume template for MS Word\"></p> \n<h3>6.

Black and White Resume Template</h3> \n<p>The Black and White resume template below suits professionals who prefer using color and shading to add structure to their resume.</p> \n<p>The black banner at the top contrasts the applicant's name nicely to help make him/her more memorable to recruiters. The gray banner just below the header is perfect for a summary or career objective — it makes one's goals known but doesn't overpower the experience listed below it.</p> \n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Download this template <a href=\"https://resumegenius.com/resume-templates/creative-resume-templates#the-pantheon-resume-templates\">here</a>.</h4> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/black-and-white-resume-template.png?width=455&amp;name=black-and-white-resume-template.png\" alt=\"Black and white resume template\" width=\"455\" style=\"width: 455px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<h3>9.

But because it’s a Word document, that graphic is easy to edit and replace with an image that represents your line of work. Are you an analytics buff?

Dark Resume Template</h3> \n<p>Ironically, a dark background could be just the thing to ensure your resume doesn't fall into the black hole of resumes piled on the hiring manager's desk.</p> \n<p>Using soft, yellow font, the resume template below inverts the usual color scheme of a resume without trying too hard to be creative.</p> \n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Download this template <a href=\"https://www.freesumes.com/dark-resume-template-freebie-elegant-dark-grey/\">here</a>.</h4> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/dark-resume-template.png?width=1500&amp;name=dark-resume-template.png\" alt=\"Dark resume template with black background and yellow font\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<h3>13. Neat and Confident Resume Template</h3> \n<p>Similar to the Simple and Clean template mentioned earlier, this resume design by Nowpixelse communicates a truly professional tone. The template’s muted colors work very well with the side panel layered over the top header.</p> \n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Download this template <a href=\"http://nowpixelse.com/my-product/free-ms-word-resume\">here</a>.</h4> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/neat%20and%20confident%20resume%20template-1.jpg?width=1500&amp;name=neat%20and%20confident%20resume%20template-1.jpg\" alt=\"Neat and Confident resume template for MS Word\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<h3>14. Inbound Marketing Resume Template</h3> \n<p>Here's another resume template dedicated to the digital marketer. This sheet offers all the inbound marketing language you need to express your values as a passionate, brand-loyal professional.</p> \n<p>Similar to a few other templates on this list, it also uses just a dash of vibrant color in the applicant's name at the top (where it matters most).</p> \n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Download this template <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/marketing-resume-templates\">here</a>.</h4> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/inbound-marketing-intern-resume-template.png?width=1500&amp;name=inbound-marketing-intern-resume-template.png\" alt=\"Inbound marketing template for interns and marketers\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<h3>15. Smart and Professional Resume Template</h3> \n<p>This is another sharp template that offers a basic but confident design for any professional. The warm-colored panel on the right-hand side is pre-formatted for a written profile, where you can write a summary of your background or a form letter to each employer.</p> \n<p>Just be sure to personalize this messaging to each new recipient so it works for the job you’re applying to. This template is available on Freesumes, and is free to users once they share the page to Facebook or Twitter.</p> \n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Download this template <a href=\"https://www.freesumes.com/free-creative-resume-design-smart-professional/\">here</a>.</h4> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/smart%20and%20professional%20resume%20template-1.jpg?width=1500&amp;name=smart%20and%20professional%20resume%20template-1.jpg\" alt=\"Smart and Professional resume template for MS Word\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<h3>16. Spick and Span Resume Template</h3> \n<p>There isn't a better name for the template below. The Spick and Span resume might be the cleanest-looking sheet on this list.</p> \n<p>It uses boldface, all-caps, and gray typeface to structure various headers of the document differently and maximize the hiring manager's reading experience. And all that minimalism makes the professional headshot at the top pop off the page.</p> \n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Download this template <a href=\"https://www.freesumes.com/spick-span-clean-resume-template-freebie/\">here</a>.</h4> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/spick-and-span-resume-template.png?width=1500&amp;name=spick-and-span-resume-template.png\" alt=\"Spick and Span resume template with clean, bold typeface and professional headshot\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<h3>17. Timeline-Style Resume Template</h3> \n<p>Similar to the Centered Bar resume earlier in the post, Hloom’s Timeline template is a super simple but creative way to tell your story.</p> \n<p>You can convey your progression through various jobs you’ve held on one side of the vertical line, and more static elements of your background — such as skills and education — on the other.</p> \n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Download this template <a href=\"https://www.hloom.com/get/timeline/\">here</a>.</h4> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/timeline-style%20resume%20template-2.png?width=1500&amp;name=timeline-style%20resume%20template-2.png\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" alt=\"Timeline-style resume template for MS Word\"></p> \n<h3>18. Content Production Resume Template</h3> \n<p>This basic resume template is suited for content producers at all stages in their career. By spreading out the header and \"Skills\" text horizontally, the resume below fits a lot of crucial information comfortably on one page (of course, it also comes with a second page if you need it).</p> \n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Download this template <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/marketing-resume-templates\">here</a>.</h4> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/content-production-resume-template.png?width=1500&amp;name=content-production-resume-template.png\" alt=\"Content production resume template\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<h3>19. Fresh Resume Template</h3> \n<p>This is perhaps the most imaginative of all the Word-based resume templates on this list — with both a skills meter and a comic headshot.</p> \n<p>The template was designed by <a href=\"https://www.behance.net/venkatanaresh\">Venkata Naresh</a> and comes with 12 different versions of the design you see below. Have you created a <a href=\"https://www.bitmoji.com/\">Bitmoji</a> of yourself? Do you think your employer would find it creative? Match the template and add it as your photo.</p> \n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Download this template <a href=\"http://smashresume.com/downloads/professional-fresh-resume/\">here</a>.</h4> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/fresh%20resume%20template-1.jpg?width=1500&amp;name=fresh%20resume%20template-1.jpg\" alt=\"Resume template for MS Word with space for comic headshot\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<h3>20. CV Resume Template</h3> \n<p>The curriculum vitae-style resume below flips the typical two-column resume so the basic applicant information is listed across the right side, rather than the left.</p> \n<p>Feel free to change the color of this sidebar in Microsoft Word if dark-red isn't your thing — the template can pull off any color you wish.</p> \n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Download this template <a href=\"https://www.freesumes.com/unconventional-cv-template-giveaway-avant-garde/\">here</a>.</h4> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/cv-resume-template.png?width=1500&amp;name=cv-resume-template.png\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" alt=\"Reverse two-column resume template in CV style with red sidebar\"></p> \n<h3>21. Goldenrod Resume Template</h3> \n<p>This template, also offered on Freesumes, dares to use yellow as the dominant color — but doesn’t sacrifice professionalism in the process.</p> \n<p>The document anchors the education section to a thick, bright banner across the bottom, but you can likely change this to a skills section with some simple editing in Microsoft Word.</p> \n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Download this template <a href=\"https://www.freesumes.com/goldenrod-yellow-a-free-clean-word-resume-template/\">here</a>.</h4> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/goldenrod%20resume%20template-1.jpg?width=1500&amp;name=goldenrod%20resume%20template-1.jpg\" alt=\"Goldenrod yellow resume template for MS Word\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<h3>22. Resume Template With Personal Endorsements</h3> \n<p>This resume template has quite a flashy header — no photography pun intended — but it’s not just for photographers. What makes this resume unique is the space for references on the lower right-hand side.</p> \n<p>Does your field need others to vouch for your experience? This resume gives you room for three solid recommendations.</p> \n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Download this template <a href=\"https://www.hloom.com/get/personal+endorsements/\">here</a>.</h4> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/resume%20template%20with%20personal%20endorsements-2.png?width=1500&amp;name=resume%20template%20with%20personal%20endorsements-2.png\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" alt=\"Photographer's resume template for MS Word with space for recommendations and endorsements\"></p> \n<h3>23. Creative Resume Template</h3> \n<p>This one was designed by the stationery experts at MOO and is offered for download by Microsoft. Simple but vibrant, this template hugs the text with an artistic header and footer — great for recent graduates who need to fill empty space on the page.</p> \n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Download this template <a href=\"https://templates.office.com/en-us/Creative-resume-designed-by-MOO-TM16392718\">here</a>.</h4> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/creative%20resume%20template-1.png?width=1500&amp;name=creative%20resume%20template-1.png\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" alt=\"Resume template for MS Word with header and footer design\"></p> \n<h3>24. Modern Resume Template</h3> \n<p>This resume embraces simplicity with a slight touch of color to make things a bit more interesting. It also nicely sections off Skills and Education notes from the Work History list.</p> \n<p>With LiveCareer.com, you can generate a template with your basic information and then download it to add small details.</p> \n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Download this template <a href=\"https://www.livecareer.com/build-resume/section/cntc?templateflow=contact&amp;skin=MLT6&amp;theme=%2339c3b1\">here</a>.</h4> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202019-10-03%20at%202.05.44%20PM.jpg?width=1500&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202019-10-03%20at%202.05.44%20PM.jpg\" alt=\"Modern Resume Template\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<h3>25.

Templates]","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/plan-instagram-posts","description":"<p>When you're not following a plan on social media, it's easy to forget to post regularly.</p>   \n<p>Additionally, creating image and video-based content that's meant to drive revenue for your business can seem <em>far</em> away from your bottom line.</p> \n<p>However, nowadays, <a href=\"https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/53/Mention/hubspotxmention_ebook_instagram-engagement-report.pdf\">71% of businesses are on the platform</a> — to compete with other companies in your industry, then, it's critical you have a solid Instagram strategy in-place, particularly if your intended audience uses the app.</p> \n<p>Fortunately, once you have an ideal plan for your Instagram content, you're able to create content more intentionally and ultimately drive more results for your team and your organization.</p> \n<p>In this post, we'll cover everything from determining what kind of content you want to post, to picking a content theme. Then, we'll get into the details of planning individual posts.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Instagram%20Post%20Template,%20Blog%20Image.jpg?width=1500&amp;name=Instagram%20Post%20Template,%20Blog%20Image.jpg\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" alt=\"free editable Instagram Post Template\">HubSpot, AdobeSpark, and Iconosquare teamed up to create a 30-day planning guide for business Instagram planning.</p> \n<p>We've also thrown in <strong>30 templates</strong> to help you get started. <strong><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/30-days-of-instagram?hubs_post-cta=body\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Click here to get the planning guide</span></a>.</strong></p> \n<h2><strong>Type of Content to Post on Instagram</strong></h2> \n<p>Regardless of which kind of content you decide to post, it should always be content that attracts your ideal audience. Think beyond your product, service, or office — what does your ideal customer <em>actually</em> care about, and what motivates them to follow a business account on Instagram?</p> \n<p>If you know your audience is interested in consuming bite-sized education on social media, you might use Instagram to share industry tips and tricks. Videos or well-organized captions can be useful vehicles for providing your audience with well-researched information for their benefit, rather than the benefit of your business.</p> \n<p>If your product or service lends itself to being photographed, consider sharing photos or videos of real customers using it. You can lighten your own content creation load by relying on user-generated content, too. Have your customers send in photos of your product in-action.</p> \n<p>Here's an example of how Beats by Dre uses Instagram to showcase customers using their products:</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202019-10-21%20at%2011.21.10%20AM.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-10-21 at 11.21.10 AM\">\n</div> \n<div style=\"font-size: 11px;\">\n <em><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B2mxwjRl8QS/\">Image Source</a></em>\n</div> \n<p>Still, there's no need to make these product or service posts promotional. Instead, the value for your Instagram following would come from drawing personal connections with real stories about how others have successfully used your product.</p> \n<p>However, if your audience isn't consuming education on Instagram and your product or service isn't easily photographed, you can take a more aesthetically-focused route, posting images and videos that people would simply love to consume. These may not drive a significant number of conversions, but a visual-first Instagram can amass a large amount of followers.</p> \n<p>The key with the aesthetically-pleasing route is to check in frequently to make sure your posts are driving actual value (perhaps in the form of brand awareness or community among your followers) for your business.</p> \n<p>If you're unsure of the type of content you want to post or the kind of content that will succeed for your brand, pick the one that you believe your audience will be most interested in seeing — product-agnostic education, product-centric and usage-focused content, or aesthetically pleasing content — and try it consistently for a month.</p> \n<p>Then, try another type for the following month and compare engagement rates. How many people are liking and commenting on your content? How many followers did you gain each month? What other business outcomes, if any, were impacted by your Instagram posts?</p> \n<p>In addition to deciding the general topics you'll post on Instagram, you'll want to experiment and decide on which content <em>formats</em> you'll post. For example, if you take an educational approach, experiment with videos versus text-focused images, and various lengths of captions.</p> \n<p>Alternatively, if your educational content lives on your blog, knowledge base, or in another library, consider using Instagram posts to point people to those resources rather than squeezing too much information into one Instagram.</p> \n<p>For example, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/hubspotacademy/\">HubSpot Academy's Instagram</a> often promotes in-depth courses that HubSpot Academy produces rather than trying to dive into the details in the caption, image, or video itself. The account keeps followers interested by sharing short clips and tips from the courses, too:</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Instagram%20Planning-3.png?width=429&amp;name=Instagram%20Planning-3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"429\" style=\"width: 429px; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\">\n</div> \n<p>Additionally, we've put together this downloadable calendar of creative content ideas if you're not sure what type of content to try first.</p> \n<h2><strong>Your Instagram's Visual Theme</strong></h2> \n<p>Once you've decided on the type of content you want to post, you'll want to select a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/instagram-themes\">visual theme for your posts</a>.</p> \n<p>Aesthetic consistency will help you in several ways:</p> \n<ol> \n <li>When an Instagram user finds your business's account, the images will appear coordinated and well-thought-out.</li> \n <li>Your followers will begin to sense pattern in your content and pause when they see your post as they scroll because they recognize that pattern.</li> \n <li>When you've pre-selected a go-to font and color scheme, it takes some of the planning pressure off of you. There are fewer decisions to make for each new post.</li> \n</ol> \n<p>If you use Adobe Spark, you can download our free Adobe Spark Instagram templates to get started on creating a new post with a template rather than starting from scratch. You'll also get access to the previously-mentioned calendar of content ideas.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>To establish visual consistency across your posts, pay attention to the colors in your photos, the filters you use, the fonts you use in your images, and, if you'd like, the pattern of content types you're posting.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Colors</strong>: Keep your brand colors top-of-mind when creating Instagram posts. Pick a few colors that complement your primary brand color and ensure that the most prominent color in each of your posts is one of those colors.</li> \n <li><strong>Filters</strong>: When using filters, do so lightly, as over-editing can dilute the quality of your photos. If you decide to use filters, use the same one or two across all posts.</li> \n <li><strong>Fonts</strong>: Select one font to use whenever you want to overlay text on photos or videos. Since Instagram is a friendly platform, aim to use an easy-to-read, sans-serif font and keep it the same across all posts. Use the same couple of font colors, too.</li> \n <li><strong>Content Pattern</strong>: To create a visual pattern for your overall feed, make sure that every third post has a certain background color. Since Instagram has three columns in the grid view, you'll end up with a column that shows you thoughtfully plan your posts. You might consider using a white background with the same font style and color to share an industry tip for every third post, for example.</li> \n</ul> \n<h2><strong>Tools for Making the Most of Your Instagram</strong></h2> \n<p>In order to stay organized, we recommend using two types of tools — a post scheduling tool, and a tool that allows you to link to several different places from your Instagram bio.</p> \n<p>By using a post scheduling tool, you'll be able to plan out as far in advance as you'd like, ensuring you have a steady stream of content ready to be posted even when other projects pop up in your day-to-day work. Posting consistently is important for follower retention and will give you more opportunities to experiment and figure out which posts get the most engagement.</p> \n<p>Scheduling your posts also allows you to visualize which types of posts you have coming out and swap posts if need be. You can see the weeks for which you've planned enough content and those during which there are still empty slots.</p> \n<p>You can also use a spreadsheet like this one (<a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/social-media-content-calendar?hubs_post-cta=body\">download for free here</a>):</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Instagram%20Planning-1.png\" alt=\"\">\n</div> \n<p style=\"font-size: 20px; text-align: center;\"><strong><em><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/social-media-content-calendar?hubs_post-cta=body\">Download the Calendar</a></em></strong></p> \n<p><strong>Examples of post scheduling tools</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/social-inbox\">HubSpot Social Tools</a>, Later, Buffer, Hopper</p> \n<p>Since Instagram only allows you to place one hyperlink in your bio at the top of your profile, we also recommend investing a few dollars per month in a tool that lets you create one landing page that links out to several other pages.</p> \n<p>Then, in individual posts, you can reference clickable links available at the link in your bio, which provides a much more user-friendly experience than having your followers copy a URL manually into their browser, toggling between apps.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Instagram%20Planning.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n</div> \n<p><strong>Examples of post scheduling tools</strong>: Linktree, Lnk.Bio, Link In Profile</p> \n<h2><strong>Planning Process</strong></h2> \n<p>Once you've decided on the content type and visual theme that you'll use on your brand's Instagram account, it's time to start planning posts.</p> \n<p>Create a spreadsheet with the following columns (or download our free, pre-made spreadsheet along with planning templates for all of your other social media channels, too):</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Date of publication</strong></li> \n <li><strong>Time of publication</strong></li> \n <li><strong>Image caption</strong></li> \n <li><strong>Image file name or a link</strong> (if it has been uploaded to the web)</li> \n <li><strong>The link that you'll add to your bio</strong> when the post goes live (or add to a Linktree-type multiple links tool)</li> \n <li><strong>Campaign/Goal</strong>: What is the goal for this post? Are you trying to amass more followers? Drive sign-ups for your product, a free trial, a consultation, or another next step toward becoming a customer? Whatever it is, an articulated goal will help you make sure that each post exists for a purpose — you won't be creating a dead end for your followers, but rather an opportunity for continued engagement with your account, brand, or product.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>When you're done, it should look like this:</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Instagram%20Planning-2.png\" alt=\"\">\n</div> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 20px;\"><strong><em><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/social-media-content-calendar?hubs_post-cta=body\">Download This Template</a></em></strong></p> \n<p>A hint — duplicate the spreadsheet tab for Instagram <em>Stories, </em>as well, to leverage Instagram's other avenue for engaging with your followers. Stories are best used for interactive content like polls and quizzes, sharing lots of photos or videos from live events, and more casual, friendly updates.</p> \n<p>Once you have your spreadsheet ready to go, decide on your frequency. We recommend ramping up to posting around three times per week.</p> \n<p>Post at least once a week to establish a reliable posting pattern for your followers. You'll risk losing followers if people feel that they're not consistently seeing interesting or helpful content from your account.</p> \n<p>To ensure you establish that consistent pattern, set dates and times for posting first. For example, if you decide to post every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, fill in the date and time column with the next month's Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.</p> \n<p>Then, add a recurring event to your calendar for post planning for the following two to four weeks. Set a recurring, 10-minute calendar invitation at your selected posting times to reference your spreadsheet and quickly post whatever you've planned if you're not using an automated scheduling tool. With the planning sheet handy, you'll be able to simply copy and paste captions and links, and you can then locate the image easily.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>When slotting specific posts into your spreadsheet, begin in whichever column you'd like. You could start by evenly splitting the rows into separate campaigns and then filling in the caption or image link for each post later.</p> \n<p>If you already have a repository of photos that you can post, though, you might start pasting the links into the Image File Name/Link column and fill in the other columns afterward.</p> \n<p>You'll also want to start creating more visual content for future posts. Consider repurposing event images that your company has taken, soliciting photos of your employees or customers using your product, or simply creating visually-appealing text graphics like <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B2Er48Aghza/\">this one</a> on a tool like Canva or Photoshop.</p> \n<p>Upload each photo to a centralized folder and make use of a standardized naming convention so that it's easy to find the file you're looking for. If you're not using a post scheduling tool, you'll likely have to post directly from your phone.</p> \n<p>To easily access photos with their file names from your phone, you can upload photos to a <a href=\"https://www.google.com/photos/about/\">Google Photos album</a> on your computer and then use the Google Photos app on your phone to directly download the content prior to posting.</p> \n<p>Finally, decide on your caption for each post. The ideal caption style depends on your audience and the type of content you're sharing. For example, aesthetics-focused content may perform best with a quirky, short, and clever caption, while education-focused content may be most likely shared and liked if the caption includes a couple of concise, clear tips.</p> \n<p>Make sure to include <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/instagram-hashtags\">three to five thoughtfully planned hashtags in your caption</a> or in a comment on your own post to ensure it gets in front of new audiences. You'll want to include a mix of branded hashtags (eg. #HubSpotAcademy or #OnlineLearning) and trending hashtags so that your post is seen by more people.</p> \n<p>You can research the hashtags you might want to use by typing them into Instagram (head to the 'Search' tab and then tap 'Tags') to see how much volume they get. Prioritize the higher-volume ones.</p> \n<p>By taking a thoughtful approach to planning your Instagram content, you can ensure that your posts deliver value to your followers, convert those followers into leads or product users, and expand the reach of your brand's messaging to new audiences.</p> \n<p><em>Editor's note: This post was originally published in October, 2019 and has been updated for comprehensiveness.</em></p> \n<p></p> \n<div>\n <a class=\"close\"> </a>\n</div>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fplan-instagram-posts&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 07 Aug 2020 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":924,"bgimg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/plan-instagram-posts.jpg#keepProtocol","linkMd5":"0afa4026c9ce8b72b74c5e3b30b662ff","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn44@2020_3/2020/08/16/13-48-27-418_d8f1e40074027170.webp","metaImg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/plan-instagram-posts.jpg#keepProtocol","author":"Lucy Alexander","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Instagram%20Post%20Template,%20Blog%20Image.jpg?width=1500&name=Instagram%20Post%20Template,%20Blog%20Image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn63@2020_4/2020/08/16/13-48-39-031_f7fbb6522b593b17.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202019-10-21%20at%2011.21.10%20AM.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn87@2020_2/2020/08/16/13-48-37-681_8ae6ffd193ef87db.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Instagram%20Planning-3.png?width=429&name=Instagram%20Planning-3.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn28@2020_1/2020/08/16/13-48-39-457_bf8e0adae702f136.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Instagram%20Planning-1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn4@2020_5/2020/08/16/13-48-39-602_1271e64d0a975c8f.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Instagram%20Planning.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn55@2020_4/2020/08/16/13-48-28-565_5fd4375feab1f933.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Instagram%20Planning-2.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn80@2020_5/2020/08/16/13-48-38-510_e03718c6ff622eae.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fplan-instagram-posts&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn40@2020_4/2020/08/16/13-48-31-003_a79d49b27db9ba05.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 21:48:26","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 21:48:26","title":"11 Sample Business Plans to Help You Write Your Own","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/sample-business-plans","description":"<p>Ask any successful sports coach how they win so many games, and they’ll tell you they have a unique plan for every single game they coach. To have a fighting chance against any of their opponents, they need to prepare a specific game plan tailored to each of their opponents’ strengths and weaknesses. Otherwise, they’ll get crushed.</p>  \n<p>The same logic applies to business. If you want to build a thriving company that can pull ahead of the competition, you need to prepare yourself for battle before you break into a market. Because companies who can find gaps in your business model will quickly learn how to fill those gaps and solve your customers’ problems better than you can.</p> \n<p style=\"font-size: 18px;\">The business world moves fast, and it’s full of ambitious companies scrambling to gain the majority of their industry’s market share. So how do you keep up? Writing a viable business plan and following it religiously is one of the most important first steps.</p> \n<p>Business plans guide you along the rocky journey of growing a company. Referencing one throughout your voyage will keep you on the path toward success. And if your business plan is compelling enough, it can also convince investors to give you funding.</p> \n<p>But how do you actually write a viable and convincing business plan?</p> \n<p>Below, let's review the format of a business plan and sample business plans you can use to inspire your own.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h2>Business Plan Format</h2> \n<p>Before you get started on your business plan, you might be wondering, <em>\"Where do I start? How should I format this?\"</em></p> \n<p>Typically, a business plan is a document that will detail how a company will achieve its goals.</p> \n<p>Most business plans include the following sections:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Executive summary: This section will include an overview of the company, your unique value proposition, and a team overview.</li> \n <li>Market opportunity: This is where you'll detail the opportunity in the market. Where is the gap in the current industry and how will your product fill that gap?</li> \n <li>Key features and benefits: At some point in your business plan, you'll review the key features and benefits of your products and/or services.</li> \n <li>Pricing and revenue: This is where you'll discuss your cost structure and various revenue streams.</li> \n <li>Target audience: This section will describe who your customer segments are in detail. What is the demographic and psychographic information of your audience?</li> \n <li>Marketing strategy: Here, you'll discuss how you'll acquire new customers with your marketing strategy.</li> \n <li>Competitive landscape: This is where you'll detail who the top competitors are.</li> \n <li>Financials: This is where you'll detail the funding that's required and discuss investment opportunities.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>While some business plans might include more or less information, these are the key details you'll want to include.</p> \n<p>Keep in mind, that each of these sections will be formatted differently. Some may be in paragraph format, while others will be in charts.</p> \n<p>Now that you know what's included and how to format a business plan, let's review some templates.</p> \n<h2>Sample Business Plan Templates</h2> \n<h3>1. <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/business-templates/one-page-business-plan?hubs_post-cta=imagesir\">HubSpot's One-Page Business Plan</a></h3> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/One-Page%20Business%20Plan%20Template.jpg?width=1500&amp;name=One-Page%20Business%20Plan%20Template.jpg\" alt=\"ffree editable one-page business plan pdf template\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/business-plan-template?hubs_post-cta=imagesir\"><em>Download a free, editable one-page business plan template.&nbsp;</em></a></p> \n<p>The business plan linked above was created here at HubSpot, and is perfect for businesses of any size -- no matter how much strategy they still have to develop.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Including fields such as Company Description, Required Funding, and Implementation Timeline, this one-page business plan&nbsp;gives businesses a framework for how to build their brand and what tasks to keep track of as they grow.

This is an excellent template to use if you're going to use your business plan as a means to receive funding. The investment opportunity section is placed right up front and is several pages long. Then, the plan goes into more detail about the company synopsis industry analysis.</p> \n<p>When you're first getting starting on your business plan, it can be daunting. That's why it's important to make sure you understand the format and information you'll want to include. Then, you can use a template to guide your process.</p> \n<p><em>Editor's note: This post was originally published in November 2018 and has been updated for comprehensiveness.</em></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fsample-business-plans&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 07 Aug 2020 19:04:00 +0000","feedId":924,"bgimg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/business-plan-1.jpg#keepProtocol","linkMd5":"c2bb87f43d1336961d48f1c060874da9","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn44@2020_6/2020/08/16/13-48-28-272_d30a779cb9b9ac36.webp","metaImg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/business-plan-1.jpg#keepProtocol","author":"cchi@hubspot.com (Clifford Chi)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/One-Page%20Business%20Plan%20Template.jpg?width=1500&name=One-Page%20Business%20Plan%20Template.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn99@2020_1/2020/08/16/13-48-31-942_316daa92eb250477.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202020-08-07%20at%204.02.33%20PM.png?width=1500&name=Screen%20Shot%202020-08-07%20at%204.02.33%20PM.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn43@2020_5/2020/08/16/13-48-29-478_f6d635f92e47261a.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/thoughtco-sample-business-plan.jpg?width=393&name=thoughtco-sample-business-plan.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn7@2020_1/2020/08/16/13-48-34-376_51fd7ded8b60314a.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/bp-plans-business-template.jpg?width=364&name=bp-plans-business-template.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn63@2020_1/2020/08/16/13-48-31-408_9babe8b954f3fb19.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/panda-doc-sample-business-plan.jpg?width=449&name=panda-doc-sample-business-plan.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn23@2020_3/2020/08/16/13-48-35-382_0baf09bda7ca0d19.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/small-business-administration-sample-business-plan.jpg?width=600&name=small-business-administration-sample-business-plan.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn80@2020_3/2020/08/16/13-48-29-815_576c6683d95c8c26.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/culina-business-plan-template.jpg?width=381&name=culina-business-plan-template.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn87@2020_5/2020/08/16/13-48-36-858_e3c40c2fa898691e.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/plum-sample-business-plan.jpg?width=369&name=plum-sample-business-plan.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn15@2020_1/2020/08/16/13-48-28-575_d9d704974bc8556b.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/live-shop-buy-sample-business-plan.jpg?width=345&name=live-shop-buy-sample-business-plan.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn11@2020_3/2020/08/16/13-48-29-889_9bbdf24d36d593ed.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fsample-business-plans&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn47@2020_4/2020/08/16/13-48-28-571_c6f59bdfcd9e8624.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 21:48:25","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 21:48:25","title":"The 11 Facebook Ad Campaign Objectives and How to Choose What’s Right For Your Business","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/facebook-campaign-objectives","description":"<p>Facebook ads are a great tool to get your message in front of the platform’s <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/marketing/facebook\">2.5 billion monthly users</a>.

Brand Awareness</h3> \n<p>As you may have guessed, these ads help <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/brand-awareness?_ga=2.203484816.1083519983.1595599444-826779246.1592840265\">increase people’s awareness of your business</a>. If you’re looking to introduce your brand to new audiences, this can be a great option. That's because Facebook will show these ads to members of your target audience who are more likely to pay attention to and recall the ads.</p> \n<p>Facebook <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1029827880390718?id=429023050853196\">predicts recall ability</a> by polling users on whether they remember seeing an ad and analyzing their past behavior and interactions with ads.</p> \n<p>Keep in mind the sole focus of these ads is to make people aware of your brand, so you shouldn’t expect significant engagement or click-throughs. However, they <em>will</em> help you establish brand familiarity and pique the interest of your target audience.</p> \n<p>Use these ads to keep consumers aware of, and able to recall, your brand as well as highlight what makes your business and product/service unique.</p> \n<p>TLDR: Choose this ad to increase the chances of your target audience recognizing and recalling your brand, and the features that make it stand out from competitors.</p> \n<h3>2. Reach</h3> \n<p>Facebook reach ads are shown to as many people in your target audience as possible while staying within your budget constraints. You can even specify the specific location you would like your audience to be in, so the ad only reaches people near your business. An added bonus is the ability to choose the frequency of these ads, meaning how many times someone will see the ad.</p> \n<p>On one hand, this strategy maximizes the number of people who see your ad. On the other, Facebook doesn’t take into consideration the likelihood of the user paying attention to the ad. Meaning, you may end up paying for your ad to be displayed to audience members who tend to scroll past any form of advertisement on the platform.</p> \n<p>TLDR: Choose this ad to send your business message to as many of your target audience members as possible, even if it means attempting to reach those who typically ignore ads. This objective can work well for local businesses.</p> \n<h2>Consideration Facebook Campaign Objectives</h2> \n<p>Consideration objectives encourage audiences to think and learn more about your business.</p> \n<h3>3. Traffic</h3> \n<p>The traffic objective aims to send people from Facebook to any URL of your choosing, such as your website’s homepage, online storefront, app, event page, etc.</p> \n<p>Facebook does this by showing your ads to users who are likely to click based on their past behavior on the platform (newsflash: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/full_data_use_policy\">Facebook knows a lot about its users</a>). By bringing more visitors to your featured destination, you’ll increase the likelihood of a user taking favorable actions on your landing page.</p> \n<p>Note that, with the traffic objective, Facebook is only responsible for collecting clicks and does not measure any action(s) — or lack thereof — a user takes once they leave the platform.</p> \n<p>TLDR: Choose this ad to direct viewers to a new URL destination so they can learn more about what you’re offering or promoting.</p> \n<h3>4. Engagement</h3> \n<p>Also based on past behavior, the platform shows engagement ads to those who they predict will engage with your ads in the form of likes, reactions, comments, and shares. The are 3 types of engagement ads: <strong>post engagement, page likes, and event responses</strong>.</p> \n<p>Post engagement and page likes will boost engagement for your ad and Facebook business page respectively. Event response engagement ads are a unique way to promote your event to increase attendance and get people excited.</p> \n<p>Engagement ads use social proof to determine where users are more likely to pay attention to, and be interested in, an ad after seeing how others interact with it.</p> \n<p>Take yourself for example — would you spend more time considering an ad with 473 likes or an ad with 14 likes? I’ll take the former, please.</p> \n<p>When others engage with your ads, their activity will also be shared with their Facebook friends, reaching even more people. Their validation will help your <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/agency/how-online-word-of-mouth-marketing-is-changing?_ga=2.216279574.1083519983.1595599444-826779246.1592840265\">online word-of-mouth marketing</a>.</p> \n<p>TLDR: Choose this ad to establish brand credibility through likes, comments, and shares and increase interaction with your business on Facebook.</p> \n<h3>5. App Installs</h3> \n<p>This objective helps drive mobile app installs by taking users directly to the App Store or Google Play store to download your app. Facebook shows these ads to members of your target audience who have previously downloaded apps from ads to increase chances of your app installations.</p> \n<p>TLDR: Choose app installs ads to increase app downloads for your business.</p> \n<h3>6. Video Views</h3> \n<p>Facebook will push video views ads to your target audience with the objective of getting as many views as possible. These ads can be a powerful way to tell your brand story or show your service in an engaging and consumable. After all, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-trends-global-preferences?_ga=2.216279574.1083519983.1595599444-826779246.1592840265\">a HubSpot report</a> found that over 50% of consumers want to see video content from brands.</p> \n<p>What’s really valuable about video view ads is their ability to help you retarget those who watched your video. You can retarget people who watched your video content to remind them of your brand and product/service in hopes of boosting brand awareness and conversions.</p> \n<p>TLDR: Choose this ad to use video to share information about your business and reach your audience via an engaging medium. Then, retarget your viewers to boost chances of conversion.</p> \n<h3>7. Lead Generation</h3> \n<p>Lead generation ads are a great way to embed <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/creating-lead-generation-offers-from-blogs?_ga=2.13713847.1083519983.1595599444-826779246.1592840265\">lead magnets</a> and collect leads while allowing the user to stay on Facebook. Users submit their personal information in exchange for an offer created by your business, such as an email newsletter or workbook.</p> \n<p>The ability for the user to remain on Facebook is a huge advantage for this type of ad. This makes it easy for the user to fill in the ad’s form, while never leaving the page or straying too far from what it is they originally went to the platform for — this results in a seamless UX and can increase chances of conversion.</p> \n<p>Facebook can even auto-fill these forms by pulling contact information from the user’s account details so all they have to do is click \"Submit”.</p> \n<p>TLDR: Choose this ad to collect leads for your business with an enticing offer. This works best when the user is already in the consideration stage of their buyer’s journey and is therefore willing to exchange their information for something of value in return.</p> \n<h3>8. Messages</h3> \n<p>With the messages objective, viewers can directly message your business through the ad using <a href=\"https://www.messenger.com/\">Facebook Messenger</a>.</p> \n<p>This is an effective way to personally connect with users to generate more interest in your business. <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/tips-for-connecting-with-your-prospects-on-facebook?_ga=2.13713847.1083519983.1595599444-826779246.1592840265\">Engaging with your audience through Messenger</a> allows you to connect with your audience versus talking <em>at </em>them.</p> \n<p>Leverage your conversations as an opportunity to answer any questions, offer customer support, build rapport with your audience, collect leads, and drive sales. Messenger is a great way to show your customers that there’s a human on the other end, ready to help them.</p> \n<p>With these ads, it’s crucial that you’re ready to respond quickly and effectively once the messages flow in. Otherwise, prospective customers may lose interest if you’re not responsive to their inquiries.</p> \n<p>TLDR: Choose this ad to encourage users to contact your business through Facebook Messenger, if you’re prepared to respond in a timely manner.</p> \n<h2>Conversion Facebook Campaign Objectives</h2> \n<p>Conversion objectives nudge audiences to buy or use your product or service.</p> \n<h3>9. Conversions</h3> \n<p>The goal of conversion ads is to encourage people to take valuable actions on your website or app, such as registering for an event, adding an item to cart, or making a purchase.</p> \n<p>These ads are most successful when delivered to people who are already familiar with your product — likely, those who have gone through the awareness and consideration stages and need an extra push toward conversion.</p> \n<p>Installing the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/learn/facebook-ads-pixel\">Facebook pixel</a> on your website will be required for these ads to help Facebook optimize your campaigns. The pixel is a piece of code for your site that tracks each time a user takes action and converts through a Facebook ad. With each conversion, Facebook learns who to target in the ads to maximize conversions.</p> \n<p>TLDR: Choose this ad to increase conversion actions on your site or app. These ads should be served to those who are already knowledgeable about your business.</p> \n<h3>10. Catalog Sales</h3> \n<p>The catalog sales ad is made with a holistic view of ecommerce stores in mind. Instead of promoting a single product or service, ads with this objective will show relevant products from your store to people who have demonstrated interest in them before. Facebook is able to recognize this behavior based on its understanding of your offerings and the user through its pixel.</p> \n<p>These ads require you to integrate your product catalog with Facebook so the platform can pull a selection from your store and adjust it as needed for audience members based on various factors, such as your latest arrivals.</p> \n<p>Catalog sales ads are also more specific than conversion ads because the end goal is to generate sales, whereas the goal of conversions ads can vary from increasing registration or adding payment information.</p> \n<p>TLDR: Choose this ad if you prefer Facebook select which products from your catalog are most relevant for your audience, based on their <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/customers/top-tips-to-machine-learning\">machine learning</a> predictions, in order to increase sales.</p> \n<h3>11. Store Traffic</h3> \n<p>The store traffic objective is perfect for businesses with physical locations as the goal is to remove the digital barrier and bring in-person foot traffic to your store.</p> \n<p>The ads are delivered to people who are physically near your store, so they are more likely to visit. It’s important to mention these ads target based on location only, which means audience demographics will not be considered.</p> \n<p>There are two necessities for store traffic ads to work. As the advertiser, you must ensure that all your business locations are properly entered in <a href=\"https://business.facebook.com/\">Business Manager</a>. For the consumer, their location services must be enabled so Facebook knows when to show the ad.</p> \n<p>With those stars aligned, you’ll be able to track your store visits at each location from the ad.</p> \n<p>TLDR: Choose this ad if your business has brick and mortar locations and you’re looking to increase store visits.</p> \n<p>Now, when you log into <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/tools/ads-manager\">Facebook Ads Manager</a>, you should have a better idea what all the campaign objectives mean.

Which means keeping up on chat can be tough, even for well-trained teams.</p> \n<p>At HubSpot, we felt the brunt of that pain in early 2018. We have a specific sales team that handles chatting with people on our website. At the time, we'd been using live chat across most of HubSpot.com to engage with prospects in a way that felt natural.</p> \n<p>Unfortunately, sales leadership began noticing we were losing out on valuable, high-intent prospects who were attempting to reach us via live chat. We simply didn't have a guaranteed way of ensuring their needs were addressed by a member of our team — which meant we were losing out on potential sales, big time.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>When my marketing team at HubSpot connected with the sales team to discuss the issue, we recognized live chat alone no longer suited our needs. To appropriately communicate with each prospect and create that highly personalized experience our website visitors crave, we needed to scale our sales team's productivity with a chatbot.</p> \n<p>Here, we'll explore why we decided to build a chatbot, how we designed the experience, and why it might be an outstanding solution for your own business in 2019 — and beyond.</p> \n<h2>Why Live Chat Didn't Work For Us</h2> \n<p>When the live chat sales team reached out to us, we knew we needed to make the team more efficient.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/crm/live-chat\">Live chat</a> in-and-of-itself wasn't a problem — but, unfortunately, we weren't tailoring the conversations to the visitor and their problems. We knew sifting through each and every visitor's inquiry was the right thing to do, since it helped <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/customer-code?&amp;_ga=2.174408802.1948013277.1554735922-509227949.1547064439\">solve for the customer</a> and answer any prospect's questions.</p> \n<p>But, since they all fell under the same bucket, it became increasingly difficult for the sales team to keep up. And for the majority of people who didn't leave us with a way to get back in touch, they were gone forever.</p> \n<blockquote>\n At one point, over a third of the people who chatted with us \n <em>never</em> heard anything back.\n</blockquote> \n<p>Additionally, hundreds of the chats we received each month were from users who simply needed product support. This ate part of our sales team's valuable bandwidth, making it harder for them to get in touch with site visitors who actually needed to speak with a sales rep.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, this poor experience added unnecessary friction for our site visitors and sales reps.</p> \n<h2>Why We Decided to Build a Chatbot</h2> \n<p>After some internal discussion, we set out to build a chatbot that would engage with visitors, triage them, and get them to the right place, sooner. This would be a win-win for both visitors to our site, and the sales team.</p> \n<p>To figure out what this chatbot should do, we first looked at live chat transcripts. They're an invaluable resource when doing conversational marketing, since you can hear in the prospect's own words what they want to do. There are technical ways to classify chats (like natural language processing), but a qualitative approach is fine to start.</p> \n<p>We then bucketed intents from live chat into three buckets — sales, support, and a catch-all \"other\". To start the chatbot, we prompted people to select the topic that best matched their intent.</p> \n<p>After speaking with our support team, we learned that getting technical help with a product while on the website can be tricky. There are rich and thorough resources better-suited for getting these kinds of answers. So, rather than keeping someone in the chatbot, we used what we know about them in the CRM to point them in the right direction. The chatbot would look at their contact record, and then serve up a contextual web page depending on the products they were using.</p> \n<p>Even though our prospects couldn't connect with a human right away, we set them up for better long-term success.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/How%20Using%20Humans%20And%20Chatbots%20Together%20Generated%20182%25%20More%20Qualified%20Leads.png?width=1500&amp;name=How%20Using%20Humans%20And%20Chatbots%20Together%20Generated%20182%25%20More%20Qualified%20Leads.png\" alt=\"hubspot chatbot example\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>Next, we recognized a large percentage of the people who interacted with live chat did, in fact, want to talk to our sales team. But that didn't mean trying to connect them to a human right away was efficient for either group.</p> \n<p>We interviewed and observed the sales team to understand their experience with chat. Right away, we noticed each sales rep needed to know three key facts about the user to tailor the conversation to their business — name, email, and website.</p> \n<p>The sales team said in an ideal world, they wanted this context before chatting with a prospect — an issue we knew a chatbot could solve. We programmed the chatbot to collect this information in a natural, contextual way.</p> \n<p>Additionally, we knew a prospect would become frustrated if they needed to repeat themselves — in fact, <a href=\"https://www.newvoicemedia.com/en-us/resources/serial-switchers-strikes-again-us\">NewVoiceMedia</a> found it to be the <em>most </em>frustrating aspect of customer experience. To combat this issue, we again checked the CRM, and if you'd ever filled out a HubSpot form, we'd skip the questions altogether.</p> \n<p>Collecting this information up-front enabled the sales team to spend more time selling, and less time chasing down email addresses.</p> \n<h2>Our Results</h2> \n<p>At the beginning of this project, our main goal was to deflect support-related chats away from our sales team. But, even as someone who has been building chatbots for almost four years, I'll admit — what we saw was shocking.</p> \n<p>When compared to <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/crm/live-chat\">live chat</a>, <strong>75% more people engaged with the chatbot.</strong></p> \n<p>Additionally, over 55% of people gave real answers to the basic qualifying questions and reached a human. While the drop-off there may seem steep, sifting out low-intent people proved incredibly helpful for the sales team.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/chatbot-hubspot-2.png?width=1500&amp;name=chatbot-hubspot-2.png\" alt=\"hubspot chatbot results\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>Ultimately, our chatbot's success came in a few ways — first, the chatbot anticipated the next step of the conversation and used quick replies to drive a visitor forward. Opening up a chat and clicking a contextual button has less friction than typing in a text field — now, people didn't need to come up with the first message themselves.</p> \n<p>It makes sense that multiple choice options drive more engagement. Think of it this way — when you meet someone new, often the hardest part of the conversation is the beginning, when you're trying to think of something to say. But once the conversation starts rolling, things become smoother.</p> \n<p>The same is true for our prospects when they engage with a chatbot versus live chat.</p> \n<p>Additionally, 9% of people who chatted with the bot needed support help — we were able to deflect those visitors away from humans in a helpful way, serving up the best place to get answers to their questions quickly.</p> \n<p>It's important to note when designing conversations, the hardest and most overlooked aspect is to write like a human. As consumers, we rarely process in our heads that we want to \"talk to sales\". Instead, we only know we want to talk about \"products I'm not yet using\". Writing with the \"<a href=\"https://hbr.org/2016/09/know-your-customers-jobs-to-be-done\">jobs to be done</a>\" in mind is a great philosophy for conversational design.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/How%20Using%20Humans%20And%20Chatbots%20Together%20Generated%20182%25%20More%20Qualified%20Leads-1.png?width=1500&amp;name=How%20Using%20Humans%20And%20Chatbots%20Together%20Generated%20182%25%20More%20Qualified%20Leads-1.png\" alt=\"how chatbot generated more qualified leads hubspot\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<h2>Takeaways for Your Business</h2> \n<p>At the end of the experiment, I've found a few takeaways that can help you and your business succeed, as well.</p> \n<p>First, chatbots are a great opportunity to meet your visitors where they are. If you want to get started with a chatbot, look at chat transcripts, or interview your sales team to understand the types of questions people typically ask. Bucket those questions into a few critical categories.</p> \n<p>Also, it's critical you and your team think through and anticipate the best way to help those various buckets of people. The more you can personalize — perhaps through your CRM — the better.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, using a chatbot to get people the help they need is a huge win for both your prospects and your business. In our case, site visitors now had the best resources for their support issues, and our sales team was able to capture more qualified leads.</p> \n<p>The best part? Both sides did this in a frictionless, efficient way.</p> \n<p><em>Editor's note: This post was originally written in February 2019 and has been updated for comprehensiveness.</em></p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fhow-chatbot-generated-more-qualified-leads&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 05 Aug 2020 12:00:00 +0000","feedId":924,"bgimg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/imageedit_26_3434612923.jpg#keepProtocol","linkMd5":"ae57ccac4a1d258016c2f9b7a6d9699e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn95@2020_4/2020/08/16/13-48-27-551_a45d0bcf0807bb1d.webp","metaImg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/imageedit_26_3434612923.jpg#keepProtocol","author":"Connor Cirillo","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/How%20Using%20Humans%20And%20Chatbots%20Together%20Generated%20182%25%20More%20Qualified%20Leads.png?width=1500&name=How%20Using%20Humans%20And%20Chatbots%20Together%20Generated%20182%25%20More%20Qualified%20Leads.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn79@2020_1/2020/08/16/13-48-32-607_8b0297669ec2bbeb.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/chatbot-hubspot-2.png?width=1500&name=chatbot-hubspot-2.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn72@2020_5/2020/08/16/13-48-39-270_54409768d3c91410.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/How%20Using%20Humans%20And%20Chatbots%20Together%20Generated%20182%25%20More%20Qualified%20Leads-1.png?width=1500&name=How%20Using%20Humans%20And%20Chatbots%20Together%20Generated%20182%25%20More%20Qualified%20Leads-1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn84@2020_6/2020/08/16/13-48-39-816_f570b406c29749a2.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fhow-chatbot-generated-more-qualified-leads&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx20/cdn39@2020_4/2020/08/16/13-48-32-835_a4a0ac8866ccc044.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 21:48:26","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 21:48:26","title":"The Plain-English Guide to Data Deduplication","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/data-deduplication","description":"<p>Nowadays, with so much critical information saved on our computer systems, we've learned to backup data regularly -- including our email inboxes, our Word documents, our photos, and entire folders of old work.</p> \n<p>It's typically a <em>ton </em>of data. And, since we usually backup and save our data on auto-pilot, we might not realize just how much has been re-copied and re-saved, time and time again.</p> \n<p>Unfortunately, over time, our data storage becomes unnecessarily burdened with redundant copies of data -- this could cost your company money, as data requirements become larger, or time, as processing time becomes slower.</p> \n<p>This is where data deduplication comes in.<br></p> \n<p>Andrew Le, an IT Helpdesk Technician at HubSpot, further explains the importance of data deduplication for a business looking to grow -- \"[Data deduplication] really improves scaling and efficiency when pulling data from one source.

Keep search terms broad to find lots of data.</h3> \n<p>Once you start to conduct&nbsp;research on the topic of your infographic, don’t limit your content by what angle you <em>think</em> the infographic should pursue. It’s smart to do general research on a topic so you gain a basic understanding, but be mindful that it can influence the information you’re searching for.</p> \n<p>For example, if you decided to focus your infographic on how to make money from blogging and only researched advertising as a means to achieve that goal, the data you pull won’t provide all of the information necessary to create a comprehensive infographic.</p> \n<p>Research a topic, not a particular story or angle, until you have more concrete data.</p> \n<h4>Tools:</h4> \n<ul> \n <li><strong><a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/\">Google Scholar:</a></strong>&nbsp;This resource serves as a great place to start your research. It’s a free search engine of scholarly literature on a variety of different topics and disciplines that will give you an idea of the type of data aggregated on the topics you research.</li> \n <li><strong><a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/\">JSTOR:</a></strong>&nbsp;This tool provides a&nbsp;database of primary resources, such as journals, original research, and books. You may need to purchase login access ($19.50/month) or log in through the credentials of an academic institution you’re associated with.</li> \n <li><i><strong><a href=\"https://hbr.org/\">Harvard Business Review:</a></strong>&nbsp;HBR</i>&nbsp;is a scholarly magazine that publishes research, case studies, and statistics on a variety of different topics, including business, leadership, strategy, and economics.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>4. Pull data from reputable, original, and validated sources.</h3> \n<p>When you find data during your research process, we recommend the following standards to decide&nbsp;whether or not to use it in your content:</p> \n<p><strong>Is it original?</strong></p> \n<p>Find the original data source for any statistics you encounter during your research process. Due to the plethora of different blogs and news outlets, many different websites can cite the same statistic without citing its original source. If you find a compelling data point that you want to use in your infographic, trace it to the original research source.</p> \n<p>If you can’t find the original source, the statistic is unsubstantiated and shouldn’t be used.</p> \n<p><strong>Is it reputable?</strong></p> \n<p>Another question to ask yourself <i>when</i> conducting research is <i>where</i> you’re conducting research. Any individual or organization can start a website and publish content, but that doesn’t mean all content on the internet can be taken as fact.</p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.verticalmeasures.com/content-marketing-2/how-to-do-research-for-an-infographic-video/\">Vertical Measures</a>&nbsp;recommends starting internet research on .gov, .edu, and .org sites, which are associated with governing bodies, educational institutions, and organizations with greater legitimacy than blogs or individuals.</p> \n<p><strong>Can it be validated?</strong></p> \n<p>Even if you find a statistic on a reputable source, you’re not done yet. <a href=\"https://raventools.com/blog/infographic-research/\">Raven Tools</a>&nbsp;recommends that researchers make sure to properly fact-check information they find by a) determining if it’s cited by any other organizations or b) checking the methodology of its original research. If the data point seems unreasonable, trust your instincts and dig deeper.</p> \n<h4>Tools:</h4> \n<ul> \n <li><strong><a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/\">Pew Research Center:</a></strong>&nbsp;\"From economic conditions, to political attitudes, to social media usage, the Pew Research Center website has a ton of free research that you can use to better understand your target market,\" noted HubSpot Content Strategy Manager <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamioetting\">Jami Oetting</a>&nbsp;in her roundup of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/market-research-tools-resources#sm.00006uybatuk9erxqe91juzya6sra\">best market research tools</a>.&nbsp;Check out the <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/market-research-tools-resources?&amp;_ga=1.230592218.7546083.1477915232#sm.00006uybatuk9erxqe91juzya6sra\">full article</a> for even more related tools.</li> \n <li><strong><a href=\"https://research.hubspot.com/\">HubSpot Research:</a></strong>&nbsp;Our very own research hub offers free market research data and <a href=\"https://research.hubspot.com/charts?_ga=1.150021622.170111609.1470925141\">presentation tools</a> to visualize your data.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>5. Use recent data.</h3> \n<p>You've put time and resources into researching and designing a great infographic.</p> \n<p>Make sure you cite recent data so other sources will be interested in referencing&nbsp;your graphic once it's published.</p> \n<p>We recommend sticking with data that’s one to two years old so your graphic will be relevant for months to come.</p> \n<p>As a caveat, some original research data that would make a compelling case for your infographic may have set the standard for its industry more than two years ago.</p> \n<p>For example, I’ve referenced research on the <a href=\"https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/sds/docs/loewenstein/PsychofCuriosity.pdf\">curiosity gap</a>&nbsp;that’s from 1994 in previous posts, as this original study coined the term that’s still used today.</p> \n<p>The trick is to find <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1308286\">more recent research</a>&nbsp;that re-tests and substantiates the original theory so it’s a legitimate data point, instead of simply dropping an older statistic into your infographic.</p> \n<h4>Tools:</h4> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.google.com/advanced_search\"><strong>Google Advanced Search:</strong></a>&nbsp;This feature allows you to limit search results to a certain timeframe to search&nbsp;for only the most recent info available. If you have trouble, widen the time range slightly. To set this up, enter a search term, select ‘Search Tools’ in the menu bar at the top of the page, and narrow your results by choosing how recently you want the data to have been published.</li> \n</ul> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/google%20advanced%20search.png?width=640&amp;name=google%20advanced%20search.png\" alt=\"google advanced search results for blogging.png\" width=\"640\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 640px;\"></p> \n<p>With the feature above, you can filter your search engine results according to when articles were published and according to their domains (.gov, .edu, .org, .com), among other features.</p> \n<h3>6. Imagine how your data could be visualized.</h3> \n<p>Remember what Siege Media found?</p> \n<p>The most-shared infographics had an average of just under 400 words. This means that the graphics relied on data visualizations, charts, and illustrations to tell the data’s story.</p> \n<p>Research for a blog post is different than research for an infographic because visitors expect to read a blog, but they don’t necessarily anticipate close-reading a graphic.</p> \n<p>Think about data that can be turned into visuals while you research. Numbers, such as percentages, survey results, and change over time can be easily <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/data-visualization-choosing-chart-0?hs_preview=SwwNpWDi-4361706628#sm.00006uybatuk9erxqe91juzya6sra\">visualized</a>&nbsp;using graphs and charts.</p> \n<p>Are there categories within your data that you can visualize using icons or illustrations? Can you turn a multi-step process into a mini-graphic instead of writing it out?</p> \n<p>Analyze all of your research findings wearing the hat of an illustrator and ask yourself if there’s a balance between data that can be visualized and data that must be written out.</p> \n<h4>Tools:</h4> \n<ul> \n <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.canva.com/\">Canva:</a></strong> HubSpot Senior Content Strategist <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/amandazantalwiener\">Amanda Zantal-Wiener</a>&nbsp;wrote an <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/resources-for-creating-infographics#sm.000825bf4hgvedv10qu25jm8py60v\">article</a>&nbsp;about tools to make your own infographics, and Canva made the top of the list. Even if you won't design your infographic yourself, experiment with this design tool (and others on <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/resources-for-creating-infographics?&amp;_ga=1.235833927.7546083.1477915232#sm.00001jv8k2j9vzembr7434ir2v3u3\">the list</a>) to see how easily your data can, or cannot, be visualized.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>7. Use the data you've compiled to craft a story.</h3> \n<p>When you think you’re done with your research, try to lay out the story that your graphic will tell. You may even want to storyboard your infographic: Write out your data points, and lay them out according to the order they’ll be visualized in the infographic. Does the story make sense? If the story isn’t clear or obvious, then you’re not done researching.</p> \n<p>It’s easy to get stuck in the story you think your graphic should tell, but does your research data actually tell the story? <a href=\"http://www.verticalmeasures.com/content-marketing-2/how-to-do-research-for-an-infographic-video/\">Vertical Measures</a>&nbsp;suggests that you let&nbsp;the research drive the topic and narrative of the infographic. If you’re stuck in what you think the data should be saying, you run the risk of citing your research in a way that manipulates the data.</p> \n<p>If a data point isn’t self-evident as a visualization, it’s probably not the right data point, or it doesn’t have the right context. Go back and gather more research if you can’t craft a story that makes sense with just the data -- If you have to fill in too much with text, it will make for a visually unappealing and potentially incorrect infographic.</p> \n<h4>Tools:</h4> \n<ul> \n <li><strong><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/trello-board-tips-for-teams#sm.00006uybatuk9erxqe91juzya6sra\">Trello</a>.</strong>&nbsp;This interactive planning and organizing tool lets you create cards that you can move around your board to organize in any way you want. You can storyboard using Trello by creating cards with different statistics on them and rearranging them to create a skeleton for your infographic.</li> \n <li><strong>Index Cards:</strong>&nbsp;Okay, so this one requires you to get a little crafty, but it's actually my personal favorite method. Write out the key facts of your story and start laying them out on your desk to get an idea of your infographic’s flow.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>8. Choose a provocative fact to anchor your infographic.</h3> \n<p>Strong infographics are loaded with interesting data that’s beautifully illustrated. These infographics are shared when they prompt an emotional response.</p> \n<p>Content that shocks, disgusts, saddens, delights, or scares people performs well: Researchers Jacopo Staiano and Marco Guerini found that content that prompts feelings of <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.04723.pdf\">valence, arousal, and dominance</a>&nbsp;tends to go viral.</p> \n<p>Additionally, in an analysis of photos shared on Reddit,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.frac.tl/research/viral-emotions-study-2\">Fractl</a>&nbsp;found that <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/shareable-content-emotions#sm.00006uybatuk9erxqe91juzya6sra\">positive emotions</a>&nbsp;were most likely to generate virality, but that content that provoked negative emotions with the right combination of arousal and dominance could be hits as well.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://raventools.com/blog/infographic-research/\">Raven Tools</a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"http://killerinfographics.com/conducting-research-that-matters.html\">Killer Infographics</a>&nbsp;suggest finding a data point that gets to the heart of the topic you’re tackling to hook your reader and incite an emotion that will make them share your graphic. Then, use that hook as the infographic’s visual focal point, and build the rest of your story around it.</p> \n<p>Check out Siege Media’s meta <a href=\"http://www.siegemedia.com/most-popular-infographics\">infographic</a>&nbsp;about what makes infographics popular. They visualize and highlight the most surprising findings first to keep viewers scrolling, and then break down each finding with more research results.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/siegemedia.png?width=669&amp;name=siegemedia.png\" alt=\"siegemedia infographic example\" width=\"669\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 669px;\" title=\"siegemedia.png\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.siegemedia.com/creation/infographics\"><span style=\"font-size: 11px;\">Image Source</span></a></p> \n<h4>Tools:</h4> \n<ul> \n <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.google.com/\">Google Search:</a>&nbsp;</strong>To avoid being&nbsp;repetitive, &nbsp;“[topic] + infographic” to see what else is out there. Ask yourself:&nbsp;<span>Has this angle already been covered, or would you provide a unique view on the topic?</span></li> \n</ul> \n<h3>9. Get feedback from your peers.</h3> \n<p>This may seem obvious, but feedback is a critical step in determining when the research phase is over and when writing and designing your infographic can begin. Before presenting a design proposal to your manager or client, tap your <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/peer-feedback-tips#sm.00006uybatuk9erxqe91juzya6sra\">peers</a>&nbsp;for their input. Ask questions like:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Do you understand the story’s flow?</li> \n <li>Is the hook of the infographic interesting?</li> \n <li>Does this data need further explanation to make sense?</li> \n</ul> \n<p>It’s often challenging to remove yourself from a project you’re immersed in to honestly edit it, so feedback during the research phase will identify any weaknesses that may need to be addressed with the help of further fact-finding.</p> \n<h4>Tools:</h4> \n<ul> \n <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.google.com/drive/\">Google Drive:</a></strong>&nbsp;Teams can provide feedback on documents and images by sharing them on Google Drive&nbsp;and leaving feedback comments.</li> \n <li><strong><a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201740\">PDF Preview:</a></strong>&nbsp;This tool lets you edit image files and share them with your team for feedback. They can add comments or delete items from the infographic and share their feedback with you by sending PDF or JPEG files back and forth.</li> \n</ul> \n<h2>Ready to Research?</h2> \n<p>In most cases, great&nbsp;data is the foundation of a successful infographic, so it’s worth investing time and efforts in finding the most relevant, current, and credible information out there.</p> \n<p>Key to the process is remaining open to letting the research inform the editorial strategy, instead of the other way around.

According to <a href=\"https://instagram-press.com/our-story/\">Instagram</a>, there are more than one billion active users monthly and more than 500 million Stories active every day.</p> \n<p>In fact, Instagram Stories are a popular trend that isn't going away. Pamela Bump, audience growth writer at HubSpot, writes about Instagram Stories in this <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/instagram-story-examples\">blog</a>. She says, \"Instagram Stories serves as an outlet for brands to creatively show their products, services, or happy customers in action. Branded Instagram Stories also enable audiences to learn more about topics related to your brand's industry. Helpful and valuable content might also allow prospective buyers to trust your brand more.\"</p> \n<p>With this knowledge, you want your marketing team ready to develop a strategy for your <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/instagram-stories\">Instagram Stories</a>. To create this strategy, your team should decide what kind of images or videos they want to post. How do you plan on taking those images? With phones or professional cameras?</p> \n<p>Below, you'll learn the Instagram Story dimensions and why it's important to add Instagram Stories to your strategy.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h2>How do I fix the quality of my Instagram Stories?</h2> \n<p>You might be asking, why do you need to know about the specific Instagram Stories <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/ads-guide/video/instagram-story\">dimensions</a>? There are instances in which you might find that your Stories aren't uploading with the quality that you'd like. The following tips can help you isolate the problem and improve the look of your brand assets:</p> \n<h3>1. Ensure your content is high-quality before you upload.</h3> \n<p>Instagram will compress images during the upload process, so an already grainy or pixelated image will only get worse it gets to the platform.</p> \n<p>Check that your images are at least 72 ppi resolution and clear on your computer before you add them to Instagram.</p> \n<h3>2. Upload the right size and shape.</h3> \n<p>Instagram is strict about adhering to its dimensions in order to ensure quality photos and videos. When you upload a vertical image or video from your phone, you most likely won't have to think about these dimensions because Instagram will automatically format them.</p> \n<p>However, if you have horizontal photos that don't fit the dimensions, Instagram will crop your photos, zoom in on content, or zoom out (making your image look small and placing it on a background). This typically results in lower quality images and videos.</p> \n<h3>3. Use photo editing apps.</h3> \n<p>Photo editing apps can help you control the quality of your Stories and ensure you're always using the right dimensions. In order to edit your photos for Instagram, you can use sites including:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.canva.com/\">Canva</a>: </strong>This is the perfect option for creating images for your Instagram Stories. To get started, Canva has templates that are designed with the Instagram dimensions in mind. <a href=\"https://www.canva.com/pro/\">Canva offers free and paid plans</a><a href=\"https://www.canva.com/pro/\">.</a></li> \n <li><strong><a href=\"https://lumen5.com/\">Lumen5</a>: </strong>This software makes it easy to produce videos for Instagram Stories.

They have templates for single images, and multi-card Stories as well. <a href=\"https://about.easil.com/pricing/\">Easil offers free and paid versions.</a></li> \n <li><strong><a href=\"https://spark.adobe.com/\">Adobe Spark</a>: </strong>Adobe Spark makes creating images and video graphics for Instagram Stories easy. You can build your own Stories with their typography and imagery options. <a href=\"https://spark.adobe.com/pricing/\">Adobe Spark has free and paid plans available</a><a href=\"https://spark.adobe.com/pricing/\">.</a></li> \n <li><strong><a href=\"https://embedsocial.com/blog/instagram-story-tools/#embedstories\">Embed Social</a>: </strong>Embed Social is a different kind of tool for Instagram Stories — with Embed Stories, you can make your Stories Shoppable by adding CTAs, and creating embeddable code that you can add to your website. <a href=\"https://embedsocial.com/pricing/embedstories/\">Embed Social offers free and paid plans</a><a href=\"https://embedsocial.com/pricing/embedstories/\">.</a></li> \n</ul> \n<p>With these tools, you can input the specifications, upload images and videos, and complete the editing process. These work well if you have higher quality images taken with a camera or want to add graphics or text to your images or videos.</p> \n<p>Here's what the process would look like for Canva. Click on \"Templates\" and choose \"Instagram Story\" to see templates that are the right dimensions for Instagram.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/The%20Optimal%20Instagram%20Story%20Dimensions%20%5BBookmarkable%5D.jpeg?width=600&amp;name=The%20Optimal%20Instagram%20Story%20Dimensions%20%5BBookmarkable%5D.jpeg\" alt=\"Canva templates for Instagram Stories.\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<p style=\"font-size: 12px; text-align: center;\"><strong>Image source: </strong><a href=\"https://www.canva.com/\">Canva</a></p> \n<h3>4. Check if the quality is better on other devices.</h3> \n<p>If your internet connection is poor, Instagram stories will appear lower quality than the would on a faster connection.</p> \n<p>Instagram does this to save resources for user experience as you interact with other areas of the site. Consider asking someone you know if the quality is low on their end as well. They — and your audience — may be viewing your stories with no issues.</p> \n<h3>5. Turn off Data Saver.</h3> \n<p>Data saver is a feature that prevents videos from loading in advance, which helps reduce your data usage.</p> \n<p>If your connection is fine but you're still having issues with quality, this feature may be lowering the quality of your feed on your end.</p> \n<h3>6. Test photos from different cameras.</h3> \n<p>As a last resort, test whether there's a difference in quality between your phone's integrated camera vs. the Instagram camera. The photos you take with your phone's camera vs. the in-app camera (or vice versa) may weather Instagram's compression settings better.</p> \n<h2>Stats &amp; Tips You Should Know About Instagram Stories</h2> \n<p>Why should you care about Instagram Stories?

It tells you how they do things, what they prefer, and who they are.</p> \n<p>And when it comes to social media, our love for data doesn't fade.</p> \n<p>That's why we love analytics and insights. They help you measure the impact of your marketing efforts across different channels to see if there's something you need to do differently -- like target a different audience, post at a certain time of day, or experiment with a new content format.</p> \n<p>Instagram Insights are no exception. Here are the analytics on this channel that marketers need to know and understand -- and how to use them.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>To use Instagram Insights, you must first have a business profile.</p> \n<p>If you're already using a personal account, you can switch to a business profile. In order to have a Business Account, you must also have a Facebook Page for your brand. Instagram will give you the option to create a new one during this process if you don't already have one. Here's how to convert your account in a few simple steps.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Once your set up as a Business Account, you can begin to use Instagram Insights. Here's how to get started.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h3>1. Click the insights icon.</h3> \n<p>To view insights into your overall Instagram account, start by visiting your profile. Then, at the top, click the icon of a bar chart, which will take you to your overall insights.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/IMG_2136%20copy.png?width=300&amp;name=IMG_2136%20copy.png\" alt=\"Instagram Profile with circled Instagram Insights Icon\" width=\"300\" title=\"IMG_2136 copy.png\" style=\"width: 300px; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>From there, you'll see some general information about people are engaging with your profile, like how many followers you gained or lost in the past week.</p> \n<p>Next, we'll get into the more specific profile insights you can explore.</p> \n<h3>2. View your impressions and reach.</h3> \n<p>This insight represents how many times your ads appeared on users' screens. Reach reflects the number of unique users that have seen any of your Instagram posts.</p> \n<h3>3. Determine website clicks.</h3> \n<p>This insight reflects the number of times any links you've included in your business profile have been clicked.</p> \n<h3>4. Track profile visits and followers.</h3> \n<p>Profile visits reflects the number of times your profile has been viewed. Followers reflect how many followers you've gained or lost over the past week, as well as the average times of day when your followers are using Instagram — data that can be highly beneficial when planning posts. To view insights for a specific Instagram post, start by visiting your profile. Tap on the post you'd like to look into, then click \"View Insights\" below the image.</p> \n<h3>5. Click view insights below a post for specifics.&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>You may have also promoted a certain post -- if that's the case, an arrow icon that looks like this will appear:</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/13717845_659368444211466_1452706666_n.jpg?width=59&amp;name=13717845_659368444211466_1452706666_n.jpg\" alt=\"View Post insights button on Instagram\" title=\"13717845_659368444211466_1452706666_n.jpg\" width=\"59\" style=\"width: 59px; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>For these posts, you can either view insights on the original version of the post, or specific ones from its promotion. For the latter, tap \"Promotion.\"</p> \n<p>Next, we'll get into the more specific post insights you can explore.</p> \n<h3>6. View your posts likes, comments, and saves.&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>Likes speaks for itself, and reflects the number of users who liked your post. As with likes, comments reflects the number of comments left on your post. Saves highlights the number of unique users or accounts who saved your post, or clicked the bookmark-like icon that appeared below it in their feeds.</p> \n<h3>7. Learn which actions were taken on your post.</h3> \n<p>These insights indicate the number of actions that users took on your profile as a result of seeing your post -- things like visiting your profile, then taking an action like clicking on your website link or following you.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202018-01-18%20at%202.01.33%20PM.png?width=308&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202018-01-18%20at%202.01.33%20PM.png\" alt=\"Instagram Insights Actions Feature\" title=\"Screen Shot 2018-01-18 at 2.01.33 PM.png\" width=\"308\" style=\"width: 308px; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><em>Source: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/help/788388387972460?helpref=related&amp;ref=related#\">Instagram</a></em></span></p> \n<h3>8. Use Discover to see where your post showed up in feeds.&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>As the name might suggest, these insights indicate <em>where</em> your post was seen -- or discovered -- the most, including how many accounts weren't already following you when they first saw the post.</p> \n<p>This section includes metrics on Impressions, which reflect the number of times your post was discovered from a particular place within Instagram, like the user's home feed, a search, your profile, a location tag, or a hashtag.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202018-01-18%20at%202.06.26%20PM.png?width=433&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202018-01-18%20at%202.06.26%20PM.png\" alt=\"Instagram Insights Discovery Feature\" title=\"Screen Shot 2018-01-18 at 2.06.26 PM\" width=\"433\" style=\"width: 433px; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><em>Source: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/help/788388387972460?helpref=related&amp;ref=related#\">Instagram</a></em></span></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Discovery insights also include data on a post's reach -- which reflects the number of unique accounts that saw your post.</p> \n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">9. View Instagram Story Insights</h3> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Finally, Instagram users with a business profile are able to view insights into their ephemeral Stories. Instagram does not, however, offer such analytics for live videos.</span></p> \n<p>To view your Story insights, start by visiting your profile. Then, at the top, tap the icon of the bar chart, which will take you to your overall profile insights.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/IMG_2136%20copy.png?width=300&amp;name=IMG_2136%20copy.png\" alt=\"Instagram profile insights feature\" width=\"300\" title=\"IMG_2136 copy.png\" style=\"width: 300px; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>Scroll down to the Stories section, and you'll be able to see insights for older stories, as well as any that have not yet expired.</p> \n<p>Next, we'll get into the more specific Story insights you can explore.</p> \n<h4>Impressions</h4> \n<p>This insight represents how many times your Story was seen.</p> \n<p>When viewing these insights, keep in mind that you're able to add multiple images or videos to your Story. When you do this, every piece of visual content in your Story is counted as a single photo or video in your post.</p> \n<p>Let's say you add six photos to your Story. Whether someone only views one or views all six, Instagram only counts your entire Story having received <em>one</em> impression.</p> \n<p>The same goes for Story content that has been viewed by a single user more than once. Instagram still only counts that interaction as the entire Story having received one impression.</p> \n<h4>Reach</h4> \n<p>This insight reflects the number of unique users that have seen your Story.</p> \n<h4>Taps Forward</h4> \n<p>This insight reflects the number of times a user taps your Story photo or video to skip to the next piece of media.</p> \n<h4>Taps Back</h4> \n<p>This insight reflects the number of time a user taps your Story photo or video to go back to the previous piece of media.</p> \n<h4>Replies</h4> \n<p>This insight reflects the number of times users send messages through the \"Send Message\" text box on your Story.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/IMG_2138%20copy.png?width=300&amp;name=IMG_2138%20copy.png\" alt=\"Replies on Instagram Stories\" title=\"IMG_2138 copy\" width=\"300\" style=\"width: 300px; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<h4>Swipe Aways</h4> \n<p>This insight reflects the number of times users swipe to skip to the <em>next account’s</em> Story -- not to be mistaken for \"tap forward,\" which reflects users skipping ahead to <em>your</em> next piece of Story media.</p> \n<h4>Exits</h4> \n<p>This insight reflects the number of times a user leaves the Stories section entirely to return to the home feed.</p> \n<p>Now that you know how to measure the effectiveness of your Instagram strategy using Insights, you can analyze that data and determine what's working for your audience. From there, creating content that gets a ton of engagement will be a lot easier as you consider those benchmarks.</p> \n<p><em>Editor's Note: This post was originally published in January 2018 but has been updated for comprehensiveness.</em></p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fhow-to-use-instagram-insights&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 13 Aug 2020 12:00:00 +0000","feedId":924,"bgimg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/instagram-insights-1.jpg#keepProtocol","linkMd5":"eecd826bb39f09b5e07cac1f62ae055f","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn7@2020_5/2020/08/16/13-48-27-314_c0ac8bb475cd9521.webp","metaImg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/instagram-insights-1.jpg#keepProtocol","author":"Amanda Zantal-Wiener","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/IMG_2136%20copy.png?width=300&name=IMG_2136%20copy.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn91@2020_3/2020/08/16/13-48-38-593_00850413dbb8e0b7.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/13717845_659368444211466_1452706666_n.jpg?width=59&name=13717845_659368444211466_1452706666_n.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx17/cdn100@2020_5/2020/08/16/13-48-30-055_5e5ecfb6bdc5c630.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202018-01-18%20at%202.01.33%20PM.png?width=308&name=Screen%20Shot%202018-01-18%20at%202.01.33%20PM.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn56@2020_5/2020/08/16/13-48-30-816_c3a6f7de0bb3d9f2.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202018-01-18%20at%202.06.26%20PM.png?width=433&name=Screen%20Shot%202018-01-18%20at%202.06.26%20PM.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn51@2020_6/2020/08/16/13-48-34-042_4803b943f96aea89.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/IMG_2138%20copy.png?width=300&name=IMG_2138%20copy.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn15@2020_4/2020/08/16/13-48-37-380_5b3c709865855896.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fhow-to-use-instagram-insights&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn36@2020_5/2020/08/16/13-48-33-613_eea03947b9e34ff2.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 21:48:26","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 21:48:26","title":"How Often Should You (or Your Company) Blog? [New Data]","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/blogging-frequency-benchmarks","description":"<p>Starting a blog is tough. Thinking about what to post and how to promote it requires strategic planning. And will your content resonate with and delight your customers?</p>  \n<p>We haven't even covered how often companies should post — a factor that can make or break even the greatest of content.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>You might be surprised to know that even though there's a surplus of hard data about why blog posts are integral to marketing, there's not much on the frequency of posting. This is because, well, it depends.</p> \n<p>If ambiguity gets your heart racing, fear not. Here, we'll offer suggestions and stats to help inform your decision.</p> \n<p>If you're a marketing team of one, don't feel the need to constantly pump out content. If you do, you'll probably find yourself getting burned out and releasing content that's not beneficial to you or your audience.</p> \n<p>Keeping a schedule when blogging is important for two reasons. First, it builds organic traffic. Next, it helps with brand awareness. We'll get into why below.</p> \n<h3>Organic traffic</h3> \n<p>Blogging is important for SEO if you want to increase visits to your website. But, if you are already posting valuable content, it might benefit you to go back and update that content, especially if after a little while, you want to give certain posts a boost.</p> \n<p>Blog post traffic is compounding, which means it gains organic results over time. This is why updating posts are important. This gives you more reads, more recognition, and possibly, more fans.</p> \n<p>  </p> \n<div class=\"playbuzz\">\n &nbsp;\n</div> \n<h3>Brand awareness</h3> \n<p>Because Google can crawl every page of a website for SEO, every blog post you make has the chance to enhance not only optimization but awareness of your brand. For example, if you're in the beauty industry and you publish high-quality posts about how to apply eyeliner or mascara, you have the opportunity to be seen in those Google search results.</p> \n<p>To build brand loyalty, make sure you're producing high-quality content. If you're producing content with images, keywords, and industry-relevant content, you can increase your brand awareness.</p> \n<p>So, blogging is still of high importance for brand discovery and building leads. If you're trying to figure out the right publishing frequency for your team and your business, keep reading.</p> \n<h2>Blogging Frequency</h2> \n<p>Blogging frequency ultimately depends on what you aim to accomplish with your blog. So, let’s look at the basics of how often you should blog for what you aim to accomplish.</p> \n<h3>Organic traffic</h3> \n<p>If your main goal is to raise traffic numbers and bring clicks to your website and content, you want to post frequently. It's ultimately up to you to determine what that schedule looks like.</p> \n<p>As a small blog with a limited team, it can be difficult to brainstorm, create, and promote a new post every day. This is where planning comes in handy. When you're coordinating your next product launch campaign, plan for blog posts in tandem, and set aside time to outline those posts.</p> \n<p>Having the material outlined and organized before you begin writing saves you time. Because you want to publish as much as possible, think of content that will educate your readers. This can look different depending on the blog, but some blog ideas include industry how-tos, campaign round-ups, and listicles.</p> \n<p>For more blog post ideas, check out this list of <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/23973/41-fresh-blog-post-ideas-for-your-company-blog.aspx?_ga=2.220501086.737336006.1574093010-940436819.1565181751\">101</a> ideas HubSpotters put together.</p> \n<h3>Brand awareness</h3> \n<p>When you're focusing on building your brand, the key is to diversify content. Try to think of the ways blog posts can highlight your brand and help to define it. How can a blog post tell your audience who you are?</p> \n<p>Because your focus will be on building a voice for your company, these posts don't need to be published as frequently as a traffic-building agenda would demand. Instead, smaller businesses should try to fit these in once a week or so.</p> \n<p>Building brand awareness gives you a chance to provide useful information to your target audience. Providing branded infographics or statistics about your industry that are branded are good ways to build loyalty.</p> \n<p>Content can vary even further, from an \"Employee of the month\" post celebrating your team to an event recap of a recent company outing, or an infographic that explains your core values.</p> \n<p>Below is a graphic that summarizes some goals to shoot for when thinking about blog frequency. Remember that updating posts with new information is a great way to build SEO, no matter the goal.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Copy%20of%20Comparison%20Chart%20Template%20--%20Blog%20Team%20(2).png?width=1024&amp;name=Copy%20of%20Comparison%20Chart%20Template%20--%20Blog%20Team%20(2).png\" alt=\"how often should you blog? graphic\" width=\"1024\" style=\"width: 1024px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<p>With proper planning in place, the volume of blogs you produce may surprise you. We chose the soft goal of three to four times a week for smaller blogs focusing on organic traffic because blogging should be a priority if boosting clicks is the goal.</p> \n<p>In 2019, <a href=\"https://www.stateofinbound.com/?__hstc=20629287.baf2406400c73bbe46641b2b9cd8a38f.1563824949326.1573769524426.1573831850666.235&amp;__hssc=20629287.1.1573831850666&amp;__hsfp=3915993429\">HubSpot</a> found that marketers who prioritize marketing efforts are 13x more likely to see positive ROI. Making blogging a serious portion of your day-to-day is hard work, but rewarding in that you may garner visits and leads.</p> \n<p>  </p> \n<div class=\"playbuzz\">\n &nbsp;\n</div> \n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem;\">Larger blogs with a few team members are able to increase volume but should be wary of burnout and over-saturation of search engine results. That's why the goal is four to five times a week. This ensures new posts have time to gain traffic and updated posts are being boosted properly to round out your campaign goals.</span></p> \n<p>Because content for brand awareness is more specialized and not as focused on gaining traffic, the frequency of blog posts is not as high. We recommend smaller, brand-awareness focused blogs post one to two times a week. While they may not perform as well as researched, traffic-focused content, they give a voice and holistic medium to your blog.</p> \n<p>For blogs with more resources, it's easier to up the frequency of brand awareness posts, especially because large blogs probably already have a decent amount of organic traffic. There's more room to focus on content that grows a company's brand and provide thought leadership.</p> \n<p>Starting a blog and keeping it consistent can be really difficult, but there's no exact science to it. Because of this, you can be flexible with how you maintain your blog, as long as you are sticking to your business goals.</p> \n<p><em>Editor's Note: This blog post was originally published in Nov.
